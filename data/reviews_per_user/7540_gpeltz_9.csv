The New World," Stunning work
","We are familiar with the tale of the founding of the first English Colony at Jamestown, Virginia in the year 1607. Most likely we do not give it much thought. It's story resides in musty text books and High School history class memories. Whereas the names of Pocahontas, John Smith and the Indian Chief Powhatan live on in legend, little else than the recollection that the princess saved the life of the John Smith from her father can be brought to mind. This pinpoint in history has permeated our consciousness through popular media, Songs like, 'Fever' tell of the love of Pocahontas, and movies such as the recent Disney animated tale, repeat the telling.Director Terrence Malick, in his movie, 'The New World' uses his unique vision, and presents us not so much an historical chronology, nor a torrid love story, but rather an acutely observed, yet impressionistic vision of the events that transpired from the first contacts of the colonists with the Indians, to the establishment of a viable settlement.The early scenes depicting interactions between Smith's men, and the curious yet unpredictable, 'naturals' are striking. The directors style allows the viewer to share in the wonders and discoveries of the new world and it's people, we see how it must have looked. Fear and wonder are intertwined as we view the clash of the cultures.Director Malick is a visual poet. This is a movie of moods; lights and shadows painted by nature are overlaid with the historical events that transpired. Details are keenly observed as well as historically accurate. The look of the film is authentic and well researched, Yet Malick is after more than just a historical narrative. It is telling, that the name Pocahontas is never spoken, rather we see the young girl, playing in the fields, a beautiful sight, and one that captivates us, as well as John Smith. Nor is the narration linear, we first experience events through the eyes of John Smith as played by Colin Farrell, we hear his thoughts in voice-over. The narrative switches later on, to Pocahontas, played by the young Q'Orianka Kilcher. She says very little at first, but is eloquent with her movements and expressions. Her character grows from playful and curious, to sober and pensive, as she assimilates into the Colonists life style. Late in the film, the narrative switches once more, to another character, John Rolfe, Pocahontas's suitor played wistfully by Christian Bale.Although set in the sixteen hundreds, Malicks tale stylistically reminds me of Stanley Kubric's classic, '2001 A Space Odyssey' in it's presentation and telling. Most particularly with it's use of music and sound. Composer James Horner has created a score subtle sometimes, even minimalist, yet when combined with the cinematography, undeniably powerful.The film runs a long and leisurely 135 minutes. The tempo of the movie is deliberate, and I did not mind as the director lingered on a sunset or the play of water to help establish a mood. The pristine shots of Virginia's natural beauty, and the sound design capturing the sounds of a meadow, alive with birds and animals calls, creates with bold strokes a natural yet unfamiliar tableau.The film covers an undetermined passage of time, and what we see, advances time in jumps and spurts, The film lingers on the early contacts of settlers and Indians. We experience the beginnings of the settlement, through the first bitter cold winter, then the film jumps ahead to a later point where the settlers have to defend themselves against harrowing attacks as the Indians realize that these visitors intend to stay. We see the fledgling colony grow, and trade established with several tribes. There is even a visit to England, and the court of King James the first, by Pocahontas and John Rolfe, that provides contrast from the rustic life in the Colony.If you are short of attention, and the thought of a movie without special effects worries you, it would be best to let this film pass, but if you are open to Malick's vision, the film experience is indeed akin to discovering a new world. I give this one **** and a half stars out of five.",9,4,9,31 January 2006
The Ring," Eerie and compelling
","I liked this film a lot. The lack of bloodshed does not in the least diminish the overall tension and suspense. The horror is visually sustained on an almost subliminal level. Images from the video, defy logic. A fly moves on the video, even when the tape is stopped. Images from the video flash back as the locations are discovered. The detective story is satisfying, a mystery is revealed only to illuminate a greater mystery. The acting is good. The cinematography is carefully aligned to the palette of the story.It is a very visual experience.  Zimmer's score is appropriately spooky. There are a few threads of plot, left dangling at the end.points that could be important, under explained, but nothing to leave one frustrated. The concept that even love can not overcome the evil depicted is refreshing. The mystery revealed is not to be dispersed by the light of day.",9,0,0,3 November 2002
Hereditary," Disturbing in the best way
","I recently saw the movie' Hereditary', Written and Directed by Ari Aster. It being Halloween, I was in the mood for a scary movie, and I had heard that Hereditary was scary. At the outset let me say, it was not scary, most of the time. It was however harrowing. Very few films have been able to resonate and stick with me after the credits scroll. Subtle spoiler alerts ahead, no specifics.
That this movie is listed under the horror category is a moot point, The film is an examination of family dynamics, from an intensely personal perspective. That the film evolves into the horror format at the conclusion does not rob it of its power. There are hints abounding, unsettling touches throughout. The use of color in the Palette, The music and sound design. And all the while the events spiral deeper into depression.
What truly rises this movie above the standard franchises, is the brilliant acting, and the razor sharp dialogue, The unparalleled intensity present, even in the relaxed moments. The top performance here belongs to Toni Collette, playing the Mother, Annie Graham; A talented Artist and mother Her art form is Scale Models. Interiors richly detailed. They take up most of her upstairs studio workshop.. She is under pressure about an upcoming show.
Her husband is a warm and caring father named Steve, played by Gabriel Byrne. Aside from being a rational voice, I was never sure of his profession. Their oldest child Peter, played by Alex Wolff, has his normal time at his high school, the only time, one senses that he is comfortable, particularly when smoking weed with his friends. The events at the home however, leave him shell shocked. I found it very tough to watch this young man become undone. Then there is the youngest child, and a pivotal role, acted stoically by Milly Shapiro, playing a nine year old. Annie's daughter Charlie. She displays artistic talent, like her Mother, she is also a very quiet and introverted child. Seemingly living in a world of her own. Shapiro handles the complex role and plays with understanding beyond her years.
From the start, the significance of the Mothers models as analogous to the real world is apparent. It seems like a Wes Anderson touch; The opening credit camera pans through the house in miniature. it is a tour of the Graham household. The pan ends up in the bedroom where the figures are real. Befitting the somber nature of the movie, the story begins with a funeral. Annie's mother has just died. Everyone is grieving save Annie, who confesses she had no love for her Mother. Throughout the movie Annies honesty is up front. She is given to long and revealing monologues, that delve deep into the characters persona with a passion reached only in the likes of a Bergman movie.
The script is brilliant and the words ring true, they sting, but resonate. Toni Collette is riveting and due an award for her performance. I should also like to mention a side role, Ann Dowd, as Joan, a lady Annie meets at a bereavement group. Ann Dowd endows her character with such warmth that one could easily relate to her, her benign reaction to a séance, is played like someone who has just been saved. Her offer that Annie try it at home, however has sinister undertones, Such is the craft of this film, It is a nightmare after all, complete with disquieting images and unsettling events.
Yes, there are the elements of the supernatural, A book or incantations that her dead mother left hidden in a box of belongings, A makeshift séance, Annie is prone to sleepwalking and suffers Dali like visions of ants and corpses. The films conclusion comes, but without much respite; Just an explanatory visual replacing verbal exposition. It does not quite match the emotional levels the movie previously attained. There is one moment in the film that absolutely devastated me. You will know the one. This does not happen to me often in a movie. It is a credit to the Director and his skill. The editing is exceptional, by all means watch Hereditary at your own emotional risk.Nine out of Ten intense stars.",9,2,5,5 November 2018
Cloverfield," Amazing
","Well, It's been out now for a week. it's no secret what I thought of the film. I caught the premier of it in a Midnight showing. The theater was packed. It kept me up and interested. To see a monster attack a city, as a spectator, as it happens in real time, is a stroke of genius. The movie made something seemingly simple, look real. To see a hand held camera spin, to catch a building falling is an awesome feat. When The camera spins pointing down a side street, to pick up an image of army men, using crowd control tactics, with mobs of people, it adds a feeling of reality and urgency to the document.One of the most surprising moments for me, was the end credits! A list of production people, a mile and a half long, gaffers, electricians, set designers, wardrobe. How can that be? the film was shot with a hand held camera, by an amateur. The illusion is that good. Then there is the technique of storytelling. The camera is there at the dramatic personal moments, When the guy is talking to his girlfriend, the close up is on his face and conversation, but when it is done, the person holding the camera backs off, with a gesture that reminds us that it is a friend holding the camera.The conventions of film making are cleverly skirted. The Jump cut is achieved by turning the camera off momentarily. Thus running up thirty six flights is shortened in cinematic ways, yet in a natural style. Things like this make the movie an outstanding feature. The shortcomings however were with the Monster itself. I respond half jokingly that it should have been a Mega. (Check out my Mega Boy photoshoped pictures over at 'teen giants.com')Seriously, the Monster lacked motivation. Was it evil, was it just big and clumsy? did it enjoy pushing down buildings? We don't get to find out. First of all, we don't get to see too much of it. And when we do see it, one feels an overview shot would be needed. The advantage of the old Monster giants, was that you would once in a while get a Monsters eye view of the tiny mobs by your feet. This movie precluded such a shot, except for the helicopter view towards the end. Yet this kind of shot was needed to give us the full perspective of the Beast. Also mentioned at my other sites, was the need to make the monster something recognizable. I still don't think I could draw this one. Worse yet, the movie lacked 'Big Feet' honestly, how could they do a Giant monster, where no one gets stomped. Oh well. All this aside, I give the picture an eight out of ten stars.",8,1,4,28 January 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Stunning
","Upon my second viewing,I can say again, A knockout of a film. It evokes the best from all manner of Fantasy films. The orks aroused the same primal terror as the flying monkeys sequence in Wizard of Oz, the scope and feel of the set's recalled the best of Harrihusen (particularly, Jason and the Argonauts)and the saga of the story itself clearly was the influence for Lucas's vision.The effects were pulled off splendidly.  I dared not hope for such close vision to that of my mind's eye, as to how the characters were presented. I did not expect to have my expectations so exceeded.    What more could be done ?  The fun of reading the language of the poems and song's was missing, but even then, I noted Gandalf singing, 'the Road goes ever on and on...' It sounded like he was using the tune from that long out of print, song cycle. (written by, or sung by a chap named,Donald Swann, if I recall correctly) It has been ages since I saw the 1978 animated film, by Bashki (sp?) the animated version was deeply flawed. Although it used a 'cheat' process called rotoscoping, the ring wraith scenes were the only ones to stand out. I give Bashki credit for first blocking out the scene of the Wraith's at the Inn. He did it the way I imagined it. Jackson did it almost cut by cut as Bashki did.(it would be interesting to compare) This is to Jackson's credit as well. This tale was told as well as it could be done. I did miss good old Tom Bombadil. He was also deleted from the animated version.      It will be interesting to see how Jackson handles the difficult Ents. The Fellowship has been a cinematic thrill for me. May the Two Towers, continue the excellence started here.",10,0,0,2 January 2002
Children of Men," Stunning film-making
","My lady friend who saw, 'Children Of Men' with me, did not like it, another lady I know thought it awful! The film is dark and gritty with a depressing 'End of the world' scenario. The motivations of the lead players are questionable, and the ending is vague and ambiguous. Nothing is clearly spelled out nor simplified, So why did it I like it? The story depicts a time in the near future, the year 2027, The major world centers have already been decimated by the exchange of nuclear weapons, and only England stands as the last bastion of civilization with a governed populous. Humankind now faces a biological death grip. No woman on the planet has conceived nor given birth in eighteen years. The phenomena of worldwide infertility goes unexplained; it could be a plague, pollution, or an act of divine retribution. What is certain is that, with no children being born mankind has reached it's end.England had adopted a zero tolerance for illegal immigration, people from all nations flock to the United Kingdom, for shelter and work. Immigrants are herded into refugee camps, and treated like criminals. In the streets, civil unrest rocks the country as armed leftists, with a pro emigration stand, and terrorist tactics, battle the governments repressive forces. The Leftists await the day when a grand uprising will bring down the government and its defense forces. It is a chillingly familiar and violent world, painted brusquely upon the screen.As we meet the films protagonist, Government worker, Theodore Faron, played by Clive Owen, he is kidnapped by the rebels, under the command of his ex lover, Julian Taylor, played by a no nonsense, Julianne Moore. She needs to get an official document, almost impossible to obtain, a Document of Transport , for an illegal. The rebels have taken under their wing a young lady (Claire-Hope-Ashitey) from the refugee camps. She is pregnant, and they are seeking to transport her to a special group, only rumored to exist, called 'The Human Project' There, scientists and doctors, concerned with the worlds survival, would care for the mother and child.I heard on the radio, a conservative moderator call the film leftist leaning, with disdain. He cited the directors youth (46) and nationality, (Mexican) to back up his claim. I disagree with him, the film was even handed, It showed corruption on both sides of the political spectrum. The concern was for the young pregnant woman, whose child represented the hope and the future of all mankind.The most striking aspect of this film, is the manner in which it makes one feel a participant, more than just a viewer. Not since Ridley Scott's, 'Blackhawk Down' have I felt such intensity in it's depiction of urban street battle, as the government and rebels clash. The Director achieves this, by using a steady, but fluid hand held camera,and long single takes, filming the scene directly, without cross cutting. It lends a documentary feel to the footage. We are placed in the heat of the street battles dodging bullets from both sides. It feels remarkably real. This movie is a bravura piece of film making, it does not draw attention to it's techniques, while it engulfs the viewer in it's engrossing action. There are at least three remarkable long cuts that left me breathless, and a few more that left me in tears because of the emotional intensity.End of the world anarchy has been the subject of several movies. The intelligent British film, 'Day the Earth Caught Fire' (1961) and the American counterpart, 'Panic in the Year Zero' (1962) sought to capture the fall of civilization, None has done it better then, 'Children of Men.' I give it ****1/2 out of five stars.",10,2,5,8 January 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," well done and somewhat depressing
","Tis a sad tale of betrayal, the fall of a hero and perhaps the strongest entry into the Star Wars mythos, to date. Well acted with state of the art visuals, this is one handsomely mounted production. I felt bad for the little kids, who came in expecting happy endings. They were instead treated to Tragedy 101. Visually the movie was stunning. We are swept from one exotic world to the next, in a story that is well plotted and easy to follow. Lukas lets us emphasize with Anakin, and his fears, this makes his downfall so disheartening. Well done and a fitting prequel to the original Star Wars.",9,3,6,20 May 2005
Lucy," Intellectual pursuit
","Lucy (2014) Written and Directed by Luc Besson. I'll talk about the story so expect Spoilers ahead. Scarlet Johanson is Lucy. Some poor young thing who gets drawn into a dangerous situation, Against her will she is to carry an illicit substance. Fist fights, gun fights, massive shoot outs, auto chases. Mayhem and much destruction ensue. Besson can do this in his sleep. Some of the chases and fights veer toward self parody. excessive to the point of loosing credibility. By the time Lucy finds her telekinetic powers, you are either with it, or not. I was with it all the way.In Lucy, we catch a hint at an intellectual query and speculation that the director liked exploring. The crux of the story; Morgan Freeman takes on the role of Professor Norman, a friendly sage who helps Lucy. Lucy was inadvertently transformed into the result of the next evolutionary leap in mankind's' development, when she was subjected to a drug that enables her to use one hundred percent of her brain power. This is where the movie rises above its action film format. What would one do with such knowledge?At one point in the film, the enlightened Lucy proclaims that her partner should not be concerned with the body count in the course of a car chase. she said something like, People don't really die. or, Death isn't the end. I would have liked to have her elaborate on that one.There is some truly mind blowing concepts presented here. Lucy invents a time and space machine that can take her to any place and time in the history of the world. the Times square backward time travel sequence was jaw dropping. Awesome sequence, worth the price of admission right there.Besson scores again. Eight out of Ten stars.",8,3,8,22 March 2015
The Island," Meet your maker
","so you hear the title 'The Island' (2005) and what do you think of, Blue lagoon? Pirates ? Sandy beaches? try, 'none of the Above' Spoiler Alerts ahead. The title is misleading. I know it was done on purpose, but I did not watch this in the theater because of my misconceptions about the titles implications. The movie was Directed by Michael Bay, and hosts seven writers. That in itself should tell you something. Michael Bay has a unique approach to movie making, when things get slow, blow something up. Michael of course hopes things never get dull. Here he takes a decent concept, and over kills it, with pointless chase scenes, unbelievable escapes, and noisy explosions.Lincoln six, and Sarah Jordan, played by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are living a life of confusion. The first act of the movie introduces us to their strange world. Everyone dresses the same, emotions are forbidden, life is dull, and the only way out is to win a lottery that takes you to an Island of pleasure. Both leads are aware that their lives are being manipulated. This is the movies best part. A unusual discovery leads Lincoln to realize that there is a way out of his world. He takes his lady friend along. The movie reminded me of Logans Run, somewhat updated. When we learn the secret of Lincon and Sarah's existence, the movie takes a change in plotting. The two fugitives are hunted down, in a world of noisy EFX, and CGI battles. buckle your seat belt, because the movie never slows down.The main issue that the movie brings to light, is the use of clones for replacement body parts. Humans are grown from choice genetic material, for the sole purpose of organ transplants, if that should become necessary. Here the clones are presented as childlike adults, with shared false memories. Again I may be making this sound better than it is. There is some good acting here, and interesting camera shots. The movie runs out of steam in the last act, and really has difficulty trying to find an ending. What we are left with, seems like an afterthought. rather pointless. Seven out of Ten 'keep em moving' Stars. Show less",7,0,0,16 August 2015
