Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Stupifyingly stupid films
","A pregnant woman, her fianc√© and several friends are ambushed during a wedding rehearsal. Everyone is killed but her. She goes into a coma then, 4 years later, wakes to take revenge. Which she does in some over-the-top Kabuki-style Fighting.I made myself watch all of 'Kill Bill vol. 1' and made it through 30 minutes of 'Kill Bill vol. 2' before I gave up on the appalling stupidity of the story. It's bad enough when a film has massive fights and destruction in public areas but no cops ever show up, or has a character commit two brutal murders in a medical clinic but no one even notices, but to have anyone be allowed to take a deadly weapon into the cabin of a passenger plane is beyond the realm of ludicrous.What finally tore it was when the Bride fell for the oldest, dumbest trap in the world. Sh'es supposed to be a great, crafty, intensely focused warrior, and it was so insanely obvious a trap, I honestly thought it was meant to be a feint. It wasn't. So I dumped the movie from my player and am sending it back to Netflix. I'll never watch another Tarantino film.If all you want is Hong Kong style fighting from the 1970s, with limbs lopped off and spewing blood as dozens of bad-boi-bodyguards stand around and take turns attacking the protagonist so they can all be slaughtered, this movie's for you. If you care about reality and intelligence and characters who actually have some sense of humanity, walk away. This thing wouldn't even make a half-assed graphic novel.",1,5,10,1 June 2013
