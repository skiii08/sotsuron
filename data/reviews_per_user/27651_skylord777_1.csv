Antz," I will never look at ants the same way after watching Antz
","Antz is a funny movie with a nice touch. Normally I don't particularly like animation movies, but watching Antz was a good choice. Not only was it amusing, but quite hilarious at some points too. I was surprised by the realistic movement of the characters. The overall graphics look very good and are stunning at some moments. My favourite part however was Christopher Walker's voice as Colonel Cutter. His part really rocks!",7,0,0,2 April 2000
