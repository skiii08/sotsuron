Miracle," Russell Delivers
","After seeing this movie opening night (I'm a huge hockey fan), I have to say that Kurt Russell is definitely the driving force behind the film. Overall, it was a great depiction of the events leading up and involving the memorable 1980 Olympic win, but without Russell, this movie wouldn't have been nearly as good as it was. He stays very true to playing Herb Brooks as he actually was and it's a true honor to Brooks's memory to have a stellar performer give a great performance in his name. I've honestly never seen Russell this good. But then again, I feel like he doesn't do enough films that give him a chance to act to his potential. I need to also add that the kids in this film were OK, and at times you can sense that their acting is forced, but since this is a team movie, none of that really ends up being bothersome because it's easy to forget about the individual players and just focus on Brooks. Let's face it, this movie isn't just about a great moment in sports history, it's about one man's dream and how he made his vision possible. This movie is about Brooks, and in so being, it's all about Kurt Russell's performance.",8,0,0,6 February 2004
Meet the Parents," Good Clean Fun
","This just proves that movies can be great as well as good earners without having violence and vulgarity. This movie is straight up clean fun from start to finish. What a great script. I was laughing the whole way through. DeNiro as the tough guy/comedy character is great, even better than it was in 'Analyze This.' I wonder if he's going to revert to those types of roles now. It's great to see such diversity in what he can play. He didn't even need to say anything, just holding up a cat called Mr. Jinx and puckering at it is enough to make any grown man cry from laughter. Stiller is at his best here as well, combining his Jewishness with a clutzy attitude makes for a hysterical combination. I'm glad he stayed away from all those Jewish family/mother jokes because they seem to be getting old. Great showing from the girl who played Stiller's fiance (can't remember her name right now). She's the one who added a touch of drama and romance to finish up the package. All in all, a great movie.",8,0,0,8 October 2000
Cast Away," A New Stage In Film Making (Small spoiler included)
","When I heard that half the film is Tom Hanks staring left and right, not saying a word, I was somewhat sceptical. But what I discovered was not only a film with 3/4 of it devoted to a speechless Hanks, but also a new stage in film making all together. I'm not only talking about the silence and the reliance on facial expression, for a large part of the film, to convey Hanks's emotions in crucial scenes (things like that have been done before, the best example I can think of, being Das Boot and its focus on the desolation of silence within a crippled submarine and the focus on the faces of the sailors to help the audience understand the situation as it stood), but I'm also referring to the filmming in two halves. In the beginning the audience encounters a plump and jolly, upperclass Hanks. He's focussed, confident, and exudes an air of upper class ease. He then is stranded on the island and still seems quite out of place. He may be wearing tattered clothing and trying his hardest to become Robinson Crusoe, but it still seems that he is nothing more than a man torn away from the world he once trusted. But after the movie's split, when Hanks is reintroduced to us as a much thinner and naturally experiences man, the audience encounters a completely new situation. No longer is this the overweight executive that we knew from before, he instead has become a full fledged survivor, unlike anyone on that syndicated island that captured the hearts of America during the summer. We then see this new man put back into the world he once was part of and now he doesn't seem to fit in here. The audience is almost as uneasy seeing 'castaway' Tom back in suburbia, as they were when 'executive' Tom found himself on the island. It is amazing to have seen Tom Hanks completely transform his entire body and persona within a movie. This being said, I can't think of any other film where this happens so naturally. Hanks is a master, Zemeckis is fantastic, and the film is great.",8,0,0,1 January 2001
U-571," Done Before
","The movie was nicely done although I would have liked a little more character development with all of them. As an audience, we knew only that they were all in a war together and nothing about their personal lives. This would have added depth. Also, everything here has already been done in every other submarine movie. Depth charges. Stuck at a depth that the sub is supossedly not able to handle. Stuck in enemy waters. All old news. The only original aspect was the idea that they were stuck in an enemy sub. But with that in mind, so much more could have been done to make this film more original. Also annoying, certain things really don't make sense. See the movie for yourself, but be warned you will leave the theatre thinking, I've seen all this before and why the hell was that German kept a live so long? You'll get it if you see the film.",6,0,0,23 April 2000
