Walk the Line," Wonderful reality
","The best movie I've seen regarding the musical scene (and by far). This movie tries to portray Johnny Cash as the great man he was and with excellent results. The 'Man In Black' surely deserves this movie and surely will deserve much more attention from the international media then he as received until now. This is the story of a believer in god, but a individual believer who was open to other ideas and accepted them. Joaquim Cash portrays him in a very close approach to the person he as been and Reese Witherspoon doesn't stay behind on her role. A pity not have been nominated as best movie of the year, because in my opinion it was (though I would accept a victory from 'Crash'). If you are a music lover, whatever may be the type of music you listen to... PLEASE DON'T MISS THIS ONE! and this was almost real (136 minutes could never show a man's life, but many messages from Cash are shown with wonderful results)",10,0,0,5 March 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Weak enough
","This isn't a movie about love, it's about frustration and repression without a message implied (maybe that you should at least try to live your dreams... not like you are seeing in this). I read and heard many times times that this was about the 'love' between two persons, but for me it's difficult to associate love with a purely physical relation. Love between two persons should imply something more than the urge to share the same bed or place among them or else cats and dogs can also show the same love than this but in much more intensive way. I am not gay, but I do like gay movies like the ones from Derek Jarman. It's sad to see so much support for something so shallow as this movie. This movie is a waste of time, money and some very nice images from the landscape (that's why I am giving it 2 stars).",2,10,54,4 March 2006
From Hell," Nice to watch at home
","Albert and Allen Hughes try to catch the great graphical novel from Alan Moore with the same name with some interesting results ... but also with some obvious misses and commercial 'sell out's'. Johny Depp does a good work in capturing a character that really doesn't matter that much in the original story (and here takes the leading role). Some images also took inspiration from Eddie Campbell's graphic work ... but you will only notice it if you know the original work. I also remember reading that despite a friendly relation with the directors from this movie Moore said that he would not sign any other movie after the rip off done in 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' strange he is credited. Maybe this work redone by Jodorowsky would give it the sharpness it deserves, nonetheless it makes a good enjoyment to spend some free time, and if you like the story don't miss the real thing from Moore.",7,2,4,6 March 2006
