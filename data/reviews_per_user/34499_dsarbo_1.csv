The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A true (wall)flower of a movie
","Beautiful movie, well directed, acted and great music. There are two stories, one about high school stuff and another about a trauma of the main character, that make this movie both compelling and interesting. This is definitely not a typical high school love story, even though you hope throughout the movie that the main chars will hook up. It tells the story about love between people based on personality, acceptance and supporting each other's dreams. It has a surprising twist at the end that made me realize that this story has even deeper layers. This movie has a place on the shelve of the great classic 'The breakfast club'.",9,1,2,9 January 2013
