Marie Antoinette," A French Story for Americans
","Marie Antoinette,was nominated this year for a Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. In all reality, this was a ridiculous and laughable attempt at 'Americanizing' the French aristocracy. Starring the crisp Kirsten Dunst, and questionably casted Jason Schwartzman, Marie Antoinette portrays aristocracy and the french revolution as somewhat of a hip music video. Fortunately, Sofia Coppola lends very competent directing, by creating fascinating cinematography to save the film from total disillusionment. Lack of accents diminishes the painstaking role of authenticity, not withstanding the casting of Texas drawled Rip Torn as King Louis XV. Just think, I actually waited in line four hours to view this film at this year's Cannes Film Festival, to be disappointed. How disconcerting is that?? Coppola does manage to evoke the feeling of the 18th century way of life for royalty in Versailles. Living in huge palaces with gilded furniture, being waited on hand and foot, and never really worrying about anything was life in Versailles. Gossip, gambling, drinking and coke were also some of the other, more sinful indulgent pleasures the people of Versailles used to escape their miserable lives. Being married to the young Louis XV, Marie Antoinette is a fourteen year old virgin, pushed into this marriage to better the Franco-Austrian relations at the time. Coppola does invigorate the sense of loneliness and alienation Antoinette endured during her stay in France, due to both her naiveness and the fact that she was Austrian. Becoming the queen of France only 5 years later, Marie Antoinette drives herself further away, as she begins to cater deeper to the royal French treatment, it took so long to become accustomed to in the first place.Lavished with beautiful set design, exuberant costumes and exotic pastries this failure as a film will be sure to gather up Oscars in those categories, bereft of any other substance. I do have to admit that had Coppola taken herself less seriously in this attempt, the film would have been more enjoyable. Baz Lurman knew what he was doing in his modern rendition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, never taking himself too seriously. Maybe Papa Bear Francis Ford never had that DVD lying around the shelves at home. Those looking for an accurate historical depiction of Marie Antoinette look elsewhere, but those looking for an evening of eye candy and Strokes music blaring as Kirsten Dunst dances in a field of lilies, look nowhere else.",6,1,2,23 October 2006
Zodiac," Zodiac Film Review
","People expecting to see another Seven will be disappointed, but that does not mean in any way that David Finchers newest thriller is not a success. Preoccupied with the bureaucracy's and failures of communication Zodiac deals not with the mind of the killer himself, nor the characters pursuing him, but instead focuses on the procedural department of this three decade spanning investigation. Instead of consuming their lives with the serial killer himself, the three main pursuers are engulfed in a battle with paper work and attempted county to county cooperation. What the film deals with is not the nail biting, stomach churning murders that Seven drew upon so well, but the actual procedures the Zodiac took in his killings. Unfortunately it seems Fincher chose to direct this epic crime drama of over two and a half hours without any of his visual style. With the exception of a handful of memorable shots including a shot of a letter inside a mail box being walked through a building until it reaches its receiver, and a brilliantly engaging shot that follows a taxi cab from a helicopter view, Zodiac seems very lackluster especially considering this is coming from the man who brought us the visually stunning Fight Club.Despite this visual setback, Zodiac never feels boring or contrived, and I cannot be sure yet if this was because of my interest in the case itself or due to Fincher's smooth direction. Either way the film must be praised for telling a story with no resolution and never getting lost in its own path. Trying to tell a story like this, of an unsolved murder case, is a perceptive look into the minds of the obsessed. It exemplifies how one man can psychologically blind people from the outside world concentrating all attention on himself. Again, many people looking for the suspense and blood shed they enjoyed in Se7en will be introduced to a new form of torture, which in this case is psychological.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Graysmith, a cartoon artist who becomes obsessed with the Zodiac case during his employment at the San Fransisco Chronicle. Gyllenhaal plays more of a supporting role in this, even though the trailers would like us to think otherwise. Mark Ruffallo, playing a detective out of Vallero county takes most of the screen time with his purposely low key voice, which seems to distract more than sooth as its striving intentions might want us to believe. Zodiac is more of collective cast adding Chloe Sevigny, Graysmith's wife dealing with his obsession and Robert Downey Jr. playing Paul Avery a reporter whose addiction to cocaine and alcohol must be a throwback to the actor himself. Obviously this powerful cast helps keep this film together as it follows its three act structure, making each character more important as one act ends and another begins. The first act deals with the media and their reactions to what appeared as legitimate threats. THe second act pushes into a bout with several detectives all dealing with same problem of miscommunication. And the third act introduces us to Graysmith's ongoing obsession with the unsolved murder mystery.Audiences falling in line for Zodiac expecting another Se7en are likely to be bored and disappointed overall. This movie is low-key and tasteful, avoiding any embellishments, and sticking to the facts of this case. Zodiac is not trying to scare people or even pull them into the world of a serial killer the way Se7en did so well. Instead this is a film about procedural's and communication, which might be a very distracting set of issues for someone to deal with, when going into a supposed thriller.",7,4,16,1 March 2007
The Prestige," What happened to The Prestige?
","There are three acts in every magic trick, as Sir Michael Cane says, the pledge, the turn and the prestige. Just like the three acts of these so-called illusions, The Prestige is played out like its subject. Christopher Nolan's newest endeavor tells the story of two magicians, Robert Angier, played by the overtly childish Hugh Jackman, and Alfred Borden, played by the always consuming Christian Bale.Separated by a magic trick gone bad, involving Angier's wife, Julia Angier (Piper Parabo) , the two magicians become rivals, sabotaging each others illusions at an attempt to destroy their credibility. The plot thickens as Angier becomes obsessed with one of Borden's newest tricks, due to his inability to understand its inner workings. Plagued with his misunderstanding of the illusion, Angier attempts to copy or re-create the trick, but due to its finally, never enjoys the audiences amazement after the prestige is finally revealed.Nolan uses a non-linear storyline to confuse us, and to ultimately try and take attention away from some of the vast plot holes within the films twists, turns and surprises. Despite its flaws within the plot and some of the mediocre acting, compliments of the ever so dull, faintly British accented Scarlett Johansson, The Prestige does lend a sort of entrancement into the world of 18th century magicians only Nolan could make alluring. Teaming back up with his brother Jonathan Nolan, the writing/directing team has fallen miles short of their first collaboration, the artfully masterful play on the human memory, Memento.When The Prestige finally shows us the prestige, or third act of its illusion, it is not as shocking as Nolan intended it to be. It seems that the brotherly duo tried too hard in the implementation of the prestige, they forgot to solidify the first two acts of the film or trick, depending on how far you would like to take this metaphor. Finally, The Prestige is a beautiful piece of film, with a few flaws that keep it from being a perfect film, but will surely be an upstanding contender in this years Oscar race.",7,0,1,6 November 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Pan's Labyrinth Review
","Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale story for adults that centers on a young girls escape from reality, that reality being fascism in civil war-torn Spain circa 1944. Guillermo Del Toro's newest picture brings us adults back to the place fantasies like The Never Ending Story did when we were children. The sheer darkness and violence of the fantasy segments perfectly complement the blood and torture portrayed during the war scenes. Ofelia, not being able to grasp what is going on around her, escapes into a world of faun's and fairies which at times are scarier than the real villain of the film, Captain Vidal played with by venerated Spanish actor Sergi Lopez. The real praise, when it comes to performance, must be handed to Maribel Verdu who's fear and inspiration for freedom are truly envisioned through her eyes. Del Toro does use many transitions in the film that lend to a one-shot impression, by using trees and walls to cut from one angle to another, something Hitchcock used to make Rope look like one unbroken shot. These transitions lend greatly to the stories two parallel universes, making them equally real to me as the two came closer and closer to intersecting. Ofelia's world of imagination is filled with over-sized frogs, bugs and various creatures made from the earth, that crawl in and out of the film seamlessly, complementing the editing.Pan's Labyrinth, written and directed by Del Toro, is a very personal film, and helps cement Del Toro as one of the better filmmakers within the science-fiction fantasy genre. Like the title suggests, Pan's Labyrinth creates a very intricate, elaborate maze, using its two stories to switch paths as you get lost within Del Toro's alluringly perceptive direction. Del Toro's use of CGI is very minimal, but mixed with the make-up effects conjures a very memorable, time-standing world of fantasy. This is, without a doubt one of the most beautiful films of the year, and along with its aesthetic sensibility, Pan's Labyrinth has painted a perfect anti-fascist story.",10,4,8,15 January 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Miss Sunshine is anything BUT a LITTLE film.
","Possibly the years best film, Little Miss Sunshine is in the league of The Royal Tenenbaums and The Squid and the Whale, all films about dis-functionality in the household of the middle American class. Little Miss Sunshine, a motion picture debut by music video veterans Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris hits home more than the other two films mentioned. Lacking the unnecessary and aberrant anomalies that are added in some dysfunctional family films, Sunshine focuses on the habitual and conventional problems a family might and does have. WIth the exception of one scene that does not hold up to the sincerity of the rest of the film Sunshine goes above and beyond the call. With an outstanding ensemble cast, each having a completely different take on family life, writer Michael Arndt turns in an almost flawless screenplay of dialog. Beautifully shot across rural America, with beautiful colors embracing the screen, this is the quintessential Middle Class American film.",8,1,4,7 September 2006
Dreamgirls," Too much dreaming for these girls.
","Devoid of a truly engaging story, this glitter filled showbiz epic fails to achieve the same kind of witty, intelligent song to dialogue transitions that its inspiration, Rob Marshall's Chicago did so invitingly. Advertised as a dry drama about the music industry, Dreamgirls launches into long, tedious songs that not only lack any kind of re-playability, but can't hold a candle to instant Motown classics they aspire to be like.Dreamgirls takes the rags to riches story, removes the focus away from the characters, and spends too much time with the overplayed, loud and often obnoxious at times singing. Much of the character development happens off-screen including almost all of the love scenes, leaving us with merely the aftermath of each situation and completely neglecting the build-up. Director Bill Condon has managed to breathe life into a shallow story about a group, basically The Supremes, where the characters transitions into song are clunky and uninvited, leaving a bad after-taste.The film illustrates the interior workings of the music industry with scenes that are hackneyed and drained of life, and in the end, fails to gratify in any department. Dreamgirls proposes that the only way for the African American community to break into an industry is by selling out their roots, and modifying or morphing into what the white man wants to see or hear. Throughout the entirety of the film, the characters sell out their funky soul roots, for a mellower and easier listening routine, appeasing the white record producers and listeners. There was no point in the film where the characters were being creative for the sake of art, instead they were creating for monetary gratification. The cast not to blame, all of them bringing together some of the best talent in Hollywood. Eddie Murphy finally gets a chance to shine beyond his comedic blunders of the late 90's and does it like a crystal. There are many characters in Dreamgirls that are overly neglected, only to be brought in and out of the film for dramatic effect. In the case of the main group, one member replaces another, which leads to a series of revelations. The drama and character development take a backseat to the singing, dancing and dazzling costume design. Unfortunately this makes Dreamgirls just that, a disengaging spectacle that is given a smidgen of credibility by its cast. By the 50 minute mark, there should be many people questioning this movie's intentions, and wondering whether an early exit would be appropriate.",4,3,9,30 December 2006
Saw III," Too much gore not enough fright.
","Hellooooooo 'GORE ADDICTS', somehow, SAW III is not gruesome or terrifying enough for me, personally. It is evident that there is a lack of the macabre and nail-biting tension that is so apparent in the opening scenes of the previous two installments of the Saw franchise. Especially with regards to the first Saw, where the budget was smaller and the gore effects were less animated. In Saw III, the gore is definitely top notch, and that is where it seems this franchise has gone astray. Relying too much on the blood and not enough on the true frightening of the audience this Saw never truly frightens, but always disgusts.Beginning where the last Saw, Saw II, left off, Jigsaw is still on his deathbed, since he has been dying throughout the entire franchise. He must stay alive long enough to see his very last test subject through a series of tests and torture machines, before he can say goodbye. Unfortunately, I was never actually frightened, truly scared, like I was in the first two. I never thought to myself, what would I do in this situation, how would I deal with this. The only thing to really think about during Saw III is when are you going to turn away from the screen out of sheer disgust and not fright. Dealing with Jigsaw's underling, and her uncontrolled anger issues, towards herself and her newly acquired victims, Saw III indulges in pure torture for the sake of it. Bringing a reasonable story, not as tight as the first, but still entertaining to say the least, Saw III does not leave much to be desired. One really does need to see the first two parts of the franchise, to really enjoy this one, and to enjoy the first two even more. Hopefully the Saw franchise will not go out with this as their last film, and will redeem themselves in a fourth installment.",5,30,59,29 October 2006
Children of Men," Children of Men Review
","The greatly anticipated release by Alfonso Cuaron, Children of Men is just another trophy on his wall, cementing Cuaron's status as a greatly talented filmmaker with great aesthetic sense. Set in the near future, this science-fiction drama spells out a dark grey, post-apocalyptic world, set in Great Britain, giving us the impression that this is the only country holding itself in some sort of orderly governmental control.Cuaron manages to ignite sparks of color in the action within this medieval world, as the film quickly spools into a chase epic. The parallel to the nativity story, focusing on the one child's birth that will change the fate of humanity all together, is drawn quite vividly as this ode to salvation pulls us into its world of infertility, illegal immigration and concentration camps. One of the most interesting aspects of the story is its lack of focus on the reason behind the world's sudden inability to reproduce and which gender is at fault. Instead Children of Men draws more from a creative well, and provokes challenging questions about reproduction, and elaborates on its importance through its narrative.If this were to happen or not, would mankind be satisfied with what they have accomplished thus far, and be ready to be annihilated from the earth? Does God punish those who are selfish, and draw their power from the suffering of others? Although Children of Men leaves many unanswered questions, and leaves us with a bleak look into the future of mankind, it manages to be uplifting and emotionally stirring. Despite its dark and depressing look into a self-destructive universe, Children of Men provokes much delight with dashes of humor, lightness, and a bit of hope to even things out.The brilliantly assembled cast, including the always magnificent Michael Cane, and Clive Owen ignite the fire of this cinematic glory, while helping to distract from the naïve and prejudice society the rest of the world has become. Caine and Owen have great chemistry when together, but Caine easily steals every scene with his spot-on acting and endearingly playful behavior.Cuaron makes great use of the same steadi-cam he used in Y Tu Mama Tambien, but instead of bringing us closer to the characters problems, this time we are brought closer to the action. Cuaron uses a jerkier steadi-cam, unlike other directors such as Martin Scorsese, giving us a more uneasy feeling through much of the action sequences, like we are strapped into a virtual reality. Much of the shooting and explosions feel like an extremely sophisticated first person shooter, even spraying blood onto the camera lens at times. Children of Men never runs out of steam, and left me with one of the best cinematic experiences of the year.",9,1,4,6 January 2007
Paranormal Activity," The beast unveiled.
","It's almost always a pleasant experience when I sit down at a screening, and know absolutely nothing about the movie I'm about to watch. So, walking into the screening of Paranormal Activity was a total treat, seeing that I had absolutely zero knowledge about the movie. As the movie began I was a little disappointed thinking I was watching Quarantine, or the early parts of Cloverfield. For some reason every hand-held, no budget, cheap thrills movie has to spend loads and loads of time developing the characters and establishing the fact that you're going to be on a very 'bumpy' ride for the duration. We meet Micah and Katie in the first shot of movie, as Micah explains why he bought the camera, for the purpose of catching something 'paranormal' on it. Katie has been seeing and feeling something out of ordinary since she was a little girl, and it seems to have followed her to their new house. Micah spends most of the homemade movie ridiculing her notions of being 'haunted', and just laughs off most of her claims until something is caught on his camera overnight. I'm sure the producers would like a critics to keep the plot and surprises in this film to a minimum, so I will be short with the plot. Basically, a lot of nothing happens right up until the last 5 minutes of the movie. This is a good exercise in storytelling, proving that we must about the protagonists, before we can start to care about them. The cheap tricks and thrills that we get at the end (startling the entire movie theater as they shrieked and screamed) would have had completely different effects on everyone had the movie been way shorter. That was the only criticism I could give this movie, its length. Many impatient viewers will become tired of the daily, diary like style Paranormal Activity plays in, but the juice is certainly worth the squeeze in this case.",7,2,5,8 October 2009
World Trade Center," Stone is definitely back....
","Oliver Stone's newest endeavor, World Trade Center, has turned out to be a success. Although there was no controversy in this film, as there is surrounding the events of September 11th, Stone does portray the event with immeasurable authenticity. Oliver Stone can make a conventional film as he clearly depicts the events of September 11th sans his overused guerrilla style. The film cuts back and forth between Nicolas Cage, stuck in a copious amount of debris, and his family. Although Cage does not move for almost 80% of the film, he turns in one of his most genuine performances. The film was extremely heartfelt and very difficult to view for a native new yorker. There is a certain attachment to the emotional volcano that erupts several times throughout the film, that new yorkers have. Strangely enough, during the screening i was in, there were some youngsters talking on there cell phones. Someone complained and after a short confrontation the children were removed by police. As the children were escorted out of the theater a loud applaud could be heard from the theater guests. Not only did September 11th bring new yorkers together more than ever before, but the film recalling its events brought together the audience. I sincerely hope that this film revisits, and opens peoples eyes up to the fact that everyone can be friendly in a time of emergency. I just hope that one day we can all be friendly even when its not an emergency.",7,1,3,28 August 2006
Blood Diamond," Blood Diamond is a true Gem.
","What can I say? Edward Zwick has mastered a phenomenal challenge to bring awareness to movie goers embellishing political blasphemy and socio-economic curtailment of life regarding blood diamonds. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting career has reveled in subjects that perhaps not many have come to really appreciate. He is not 'just' an actor. He is trying to ferment the actualization that there is a major and disturbing reality of corruption and death in countries worldwide, and whilst doing so has brought forth a deep meaning of self-reliance, when attempting to embellish his role playing. DiCaprio has surely defined himself as an action star, with more finesse and confidence than anyone working in that field today.Blood Diamond visualizes the physical deprivation of humanity, through the limb dismemberment and massacre of the Sierra Leone people. It truly exemplifies how individuals wielding a gun on a pick-up truck can claim themselves as a revolutionary, no matter what the age group. This film only scratches the surface of the growing problems in Africa, describing these problems with a simple acronym, TIA, standing for This Is Africa, an internationally mutilated abyss.Djimon Hounsou, who has been appropriately typecast as the African fisherman, delivers a heartfelt, honest and tear inducing performance. DiCaprio and Hounsou's performances will definitely be worthy of the proverbial Oscar nod this year. How many actors do we know that can make his audience feel what he sees with his eyes. Unfortunately, Jennifer Connelly brings one her most dull performances, never coming close to the caliber of acting that surrounds her. Blood Diamond delivers direct assertions as a socio-political thriller, and hopefully this will be another jab at the sheer evasion of this much ignored topic.",8,2,4,9 December 2006
Invincible," Invincible, Disney has a sure hit here.
","Ericson Core, first motion picture brings the usually impressive performance by Mark Wahlburg together with an inspiring true story. Invincible, to be grouped with the likes of Miracle and The Rookie, a string of true, inspirational sports stories adapted into motion pictures by the memorable Walt Disney family. This story in particular chronicles the 'mid-life' of Vince Papale, a bar tender who outplays all of his childhood friends in weekly football games in the neighborhood. This formula is spot on as the film makes us root for the kid who never played college ball, and ends up making the Philadelphia Eagles. Ericson Core's experience with cinematography clearly shows in his motion picture debut as all his action shots are very smooth, and executed without any confusion. Along with all true stories this film comes equipped with a written conclusion before the end credits roll, explaining Papale's future and where he is now. Disney has covered football, hockey and baseball, let us see what they have in store for us next.",7,0,1,7 September 2006
The Fountain," Bautiful Imagery holds a Beautiful Story stronger.
","Some of the most beautiful imagery is brought together with an endearing story, that sums up the epitome of an ideally inspirational love tale. Written and Directed by the masterful Harvard graduate, Darren Aronofsky, The Fountain spans across three different time periods, with reoccurring theme of love and eternal life. This blossoming film becomes more and more entrancing as it continues to go back and forth between the three lover's, doomed to meet the same fate by the end of the film. Hugh Jackman plays all three male protagonists, while the ever-so gentle Rachel Weisz plays all three of the lovers. The third story, which takes place in the future, is the more complicated, and what will no undoubtedly drive most cinema goers away from this masterpiece. Set in the future, of which time we are not privy to, the third segment takes place in space and takes us along for a journey to a dying nebula. After many problems behind the scenes of this film, Aronofsky finally completed The Fountain and this futuristic segment without the help of modern computer graphics. Able to withstand the test of time, The Fountain will definitely achieve a larger following when released to digital video.Accompanying Aronofsky in this endeavor comes long standing friend and musician Clint Mansell, who decided to work with the brilliantly epic Scottish band Mogwai, on this progressively haunting theme. Although the film has a short running time, of only 96 minutes, Aronofsky and his crew live up to their last two films. The Fountain is nothing like his last two movies, which used hip-hop sounds and fast-cut editing in a music video style. In this epic, Aronofsky uses more traditional style camera work, and allot of overhead shots, simulating satellite photography up-close. Unfortunately, The Fountains release will most likely go unnoticed whilst in theaters proving once again that Hollywood's better films usually tread far under the radar, until Oscar season.",10,6,12,27 November 2006
The Departed," The Departed : A Sure Arrival of Martin Scorsese.
","Martin Scorcese's new film, The Departed, a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong hit Internal Affairs, takes the action from the streets of China and moves it to Boston. Although it was changed to an American film, The Departed still focuses on the same conflict between the state police and the local mob, in this case overseen by the old-school, charismatic, Irish mobster Frank Costello played by the delightfully maleficent Jack Nicholson. Double crossing and infiltration have been a classic setup within most of Hong Kongs gangster films, and this is no exception. Starting with the City on Fire remake Reservoir Dogs, America has been doing an excellent job of remaking, whilst simultaneously manipulating, and thickening these thrillers.The Departed, involves two cops, both working for the Massachusetts State Department, and working both sides of the law for Costello. The problem is the two know nothing of each others involvement within the crime syndicate itself. William Costigan (DiCaprio) and Colin Sullivan (Damon) never actually cross paths until the end, and this evolves into a breathtaking plunge into the much anticipated climax of the film. And let us not forget the brilliant role of Mark Wahlberg, the always disgruntled, crudely blunt cop working with Queenen (Martin Sheen) in charge of the undercover unit. This team intelligently offsets itself, from the exaggerated bad cop role to the less intimidating, but sensible good cop.Honestly one of Scorseses' best pictures since Goodfellas, The Departed is terribly engrossing with its double-crossing, not having a single scene robbed of suspense. The stellar cast brings together some of the best cops and robbers imagery we've seen since Narc, never having dull performances, or stealing the believability of the characters. Cutting between the lives of two 'rats', living on the opposite end of the spectrum, Scorsese truly captures the fear and anxiety of the two characters, which is unequivocally unfathomable. I commend this film, in not only bringing originality in its dialog from a remake, but for its re-birth of the genre. There is nobody perfect enough to bring the life back into crime films, as the person who perfected it, Martin Scorsese. If there ever was a Kill Bill for the Scorsese fans, The Departed would be it, with a gun splattered stain around every corner.",10,0,1,7 October 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Last King of Scotland's film is Kevin McDonald
","Forest Whittaker and Kevin McAvoy in Kevin McDonald's new film Last King of Scotland display the kind of brilliant on-screen magic any director can dream of. Haunting the screen with his ogre-like frame and wickedly alluring smile Whittaker plays the role of Idi Amin, the Ugandan President put in power by the British in a time of hostility and despair. McAvoy, opposite of Whittaker, plays the role of a young Scottish doctor, Nicolas Carrigan, free-spirited and naive enough to become Amin's personal physician. Never actually seeing the violence of Amin on-screen, both the audience and Carrigan are fooled by Amin's artful craftiness. Shot in a documentary style, almost guerrilla at times, McDonald captures the true sorrow and passion that Whittaker portrays with such ease it is repeatedly scary. Also bringing remarkable roles to the screen are the two main female characters, Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington. Anderson as a lonely relief worker, that lacks attention from her relief engrossed husband, brings a deep character to the screen in just a few scenes, and then disappears all too quickly. Washington as one Amin's multiple wives helps bring the fear of Amin to the screen in a tale where the visage of deception is lifted far too late. As the film draws to its conclusion Whitaker is unleashed and transforms into a roaring monster of a man, making the last scenes of the film almost unwatchable. We cannot help but watch the brutal African rituals McDonald brings to life in an airport terminal Duty Free shop, no less. Finally, McDonald has crafted a beautifully haunting portrayal of a man so enthralled by the passion for his country, he destroys both himself and Uganda.",8,1,2,18 October 2006
Shooter," Shooter misses the bulls-eye.
","During the late 70's Hollywood laid down a series of sophisticated films tackling the controversy surrounding the presidential administration at the time. Movies like All the President's Men and Marathon Man involved one man taking on the government after accidentally being exposed to sensitive life-threatening information. That era of Hollywood is clearly over, and despite the controversy that surrounds the current administration, documentaries are the only genre of film that seem to cleverly bring attention to these matters. Shooter is weighed down heavily with its own political agenda, that in this case seems to be the major priority, making the action a sort of obligatory addition. This is why Shooter is heavily flawed, and also why the action is heavily distracting , being that it makes little sense much of the time. There is a sniper stand-off in the snow, on top of a mountain for no reason whatsoever, other than to have the snipers themselves dressed in white instead of the usual camouflage we have become so bored of seeing them in. Mark Wahlburg, one of my favorite actors in recent years(coming off of this years best picture The Departed) is the vehicle for this homage to Rambo, making his resume slightly less attractive. Action junkies will be happy to see plenty of explosions, car chases(an insult to the French Connection), and a slew more one-liners that even Schwarzenegger would envy. All in all Shooter is exactly what it looks like, the only surprise was that none of the cast have shot themselves after seeing the final product.",4,11,32,22 March 2007
The Good Shepherd," The Good Shepherd keeps its flock safe.
","Robert De Niro has crafted a story about espionage, lies and the American way in his second directorial bout. As De Niro borrowed from Martin Scorsese for his first film, A Bronx Tale, he borrows heavily from Francis Ford Copolla in this case and borrows well. This time around De Niro focuses on the inception of the C.I.A, and their involvement in various Government coups outside the United States, all in the name of freedom. Matt Damon stars as Edwards, the perfect arian specimen, bread into Ivy League stature and inducted into a secret society whose predecessors included ex-presidents, senators and congressmen. If there was ever a piece of solid film-making, The Good Shepherd would be it, never seeming too boring or overbearing in its 170 minute runtime. Paralleling the Copolla tradition, De Niro tells this story in a non-linear fashion, which ties in the two stories closer and closer as the film drives to its finally.The Good Shepard is not as good as A Bronx Tale, but on its own this film's character development does embody a larger scope, and deals with a much more global aspect than its predecessor. There have been many films like this, including Spy Games, that lack the mature and authentic inspiration that The Good Shepherd nailed in its entirety, whether this particular story was true or not. De Niro's role, or cameo in this case, seemed a little forced, and too contrived, but can be coped with, as his role is short and easily forgetful. Some of the dialog is also flawed, due to the scripts weakness in dealing with the underdeveloped female characters, thrown into the film for sheer tragic effect. The overall story, dealing with war-time, both intelligence and counter-intelligence, parallel the way wars are fought today. There are many aspects of the film that, deliberately or not, most likely the prior, mirror how Americans view threats outside the United States. Not only are non-democratic governments viewed as threats, but they are taken down by what this film proves is the ''heart and soul' of the United States, the C.I.A.Despite the films political message, that might not be pleasantly received by most , and may be viewed by even more as an anti-American film, this is a more American film than initially perceived. The Good Shepherd tries to show the hypocrisy's and sheer ignorance that leads to many of the choices a government makes today, and ironically made the same mistakes in their choices years ago. Much of the film deals with war quietly and the basis that wars are fought not only in the battlefield, but more importantly in offices while wearing suites and ties. De Niro captures these actions brilliantly in this political thriller, and will draw a lot of unavoidable criticism due to his choice of material.",7,11,21,22 December 2006
Casino Royale," Bond is back, with a Veangance.
","Casino Royale begins in Black and white, foreshadowing the more dark and violent tone that follows Daniel Craig around the world for two and a half hours. Director David Campbell has breathed life back into what some feared as a dead franchise. Brushing all worries aside, Craig was almost perfect for this new and updated version of James Bond. Although Craig is not as handsome or sleek in his demeanor as the previous Bonds, his grittier attitude does match his looks. It seems MGM put all the pieces of the new Bond puzzle together quite well, but missed one of the most important pieces, the Bond girl. The new Bond girl, played by the anorexic looking and consistently dull import Eva Green, does bring the film down as a whole.The action in Casino Royale is stellar, snatching all of Bonds usual attention away from his futuristic gadgets and luxurious cars, and centering on pure adrenaline pumping action. Casino Royale may also have one of the best opening credit montages to grace a Bond film, coupled with the catchy theme song brought to us by Chris Cornell. Casino Royale was filmed across the world, picking beautiful locales to compliment the exquisite camera work, bringing us closer to a classier James Bond film.Another interesting point that should be brought up is the lack of one main villain in this supposed prequel to the life of this promiscuous secret agent. The villain in this is more the greed that can persuade seemingly anyone into the life of corruption. This installment of the franchise does zero in more on Bond's abatement from arrogance, and his struggle with becoming a more efficient agent. Casino Royale is a definite see for the Bond fan, and any newcomer alike.",7,1,3,16 November 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," Smith is in a Pursuit for an Oscar
","Will Smith's screen presence, despite its clear Oscar yearning, far surpasses this films capabilities on its own. Directed by first time English-language writer/director Gabriele Muccino, this sappy, even cheesy at times, epic drama about one man's determination, is brought to classier heights through Smith's authentic performance. Never going out of character or being 'Will Smith', Smith's performance in The Pursuit of Happiness, incorrectly spelled purposely, is reminiscent of his role in Michael Mann's Ali. Smith's role as a father, trying to take care of his son, played by real-life son Jayden Smith, definitely brings the father-son chemistry and struggle to tear inducing moments more genuinely. Thandie Newton, who seems to be playing the same unappreciative non-understanding wife, she did in Paul Haggis' Crash, brings nothing new to the table other than a refreshing sense of loathing.Based on a true story, Pursuit of Happiness has clearly been embellished, allowing Smith and son to really shine in moments that were probably otherwise boring and less intimate. It is the close-ups, the all affectionate moments that Smith pours his heart into, that really push this movie beyond its regurgitating material and into an emotional spin of consciousness. During the films 117 minute running time we are introduced to Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) daily life, which really lends to our understanding of the delicate life this man and his son lead. Many people will obviously be bitter about the manipulative plays of the filmmakers, that through charismatic on-screen presence and tears, will make you sympathize for someone who otherwise would not be sympathized. There is some truth in this, but try and enjoy the movie for how it makes you feel, even if it is using every trick to bring out those usually buried feelings. At least it is evoking something, whether it be fabricated or not, the result is still genuine.In the tear jerking, man crying tradition, The Pursuit of Happiness has all the comedy and drama woven neatly into this time old story of a screenplay. This film will definitely hit home for many, being that this is such a widely common topic, and the fact that family struggle is universal. There have been films like this before it, and there will be films like this afterward, but I believe that the stunning performances, and smoothly appropriate camera work will set this one aside from the rest.",7,5,12,15 December 2006
