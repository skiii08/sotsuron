Insidious: Chapter 2," Brilliant Horror
","I went into this film with fairly high expectations. They clearly were not high enough. This easily matches, if not surpasses the first instalment. I loved the first film, and this is easily the best horror sequel I have ever seen.The storyline was fantastic, the slightly ambiguous ending of the first film was brought to light nicely, and a deeper more complex meaning behind the haunting was revealed. The full extent of the main plot line was given in chunks, so that I was always kept guessing, right up until the end.The actors played their roles well, child acting included. The roles were believable, and the characters were portrayed nicely.The main thing that makes this film (and the first) so good is that it is actually scary. There is hardly any violence, no blood, but they are some of the most jumpy films that I have seen. The lower budget effects are used simply and to great effect. The low key nature of the scares make them all the more believable.Overall this is a fantastic horror film, and matching the excellent original, if you haven't seen Insidious, see it so that you can see this! If you have seen Insidious, just see this!",8,35,69,25 September 2013
The Avengers," Fantastic finish to a sequence of films.
","This was not a standalone film. This was the culmination of 5 excellent superhero films in their own right. The build up was cleverly done, with small bits and pieces here and there involving Nick Fury, agent Coulson etc. For people who had seen the other films, no character intro was needed, but there was still easily enough development within the film itself for newcomers to get to know each character enough to see their importance in the team. The story was good, with all actors involved putting in fantastic performances. Mark Ruffalo was an excellent new Hulk. Even the smaller characters, such as Coulson, were put forward well, for example in Coulson's case development through the previous films, culminating in his very emotional death (or not Agents of Shield!). I was amazed at how they managed to portray all of the main characters individual struggles in such a short space of time. This made you feel even more for the characters as the film developed. Of course, what the majority of people are looking for in superhero films is action. We got that. The alien invasion was done superbly, and on an epic scale. This film is brilliant for people who know their superheroes, or people who don't. I loved it, and so will most who see it. Bring on the next round of films and Avengers age of Ultron!",9,1,4,20 September 2013
Skyfall," Excellent
","I was dubious about this film. I enjoy the James Bond books immensely, and loved Casino Royal (film), feeling that it remained fairly true to the storyline and dark feel of the book. After Quantum of Solace, which was a disappointment in my opinion, I was worried that this would go down the same road, especially as it was not originally a book. I was very pleasantly surprised. Daniel Craig is fantastic in his role, he is pretty much the way that I imagine Bond to be. The film has just the right amount of over the top action scenes, without going too far like some films previously have. The storyline was excellent, tackling Bond's demons well, with both an ensnaring and entertaining story throughout. Overall a very good addition to the James Bond franchise.",8,4,8,15 September 2013
The Babadook," You can't get rid of the Babadook...
","So often films with great trailers end up disappointing. This was definitely not the case with The Babadook. Although not what I expected, the film lived up to, if not surpassed all of my expectations. The suspense is fantastic, although slow to start it brilliantly sets the tone in the first 40-50 minutes, with both the Mother and child giving extremely good performances. The creepy monster and old house routine produces some nice scares throughout, and I have to say I found the noises it made terrifying. So many horror films go way too far with the jumps and scares, but I often find, as I did with this film that less is more, and the lack visual representation of the Babadook (it is often just seen as a shadow or glimpsed briefly) allowed my imagination to flow, making the whole premise more scary. This isn't a conventional horror, and the focus on the characters instead of the Babadook made it scary in a much deeper way than ghosts and ghouls ever could. If you are looking to see this film with the intent of getting a few jumps and going home, then you will be disappointed. I have seen so many 1 star reviews of people who just didn't get the film at all. If you enjoy a psychological horror with a deep meaning behind it (and is terrifying) then you will love this film. The best horror, and in fact film I have seen in a while.",10,8,19,5 November 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Amazing
","I love JRR Tolkien. His works are incredible, and through the various posthumous releases, a world has been created that is simply epic. The Hobbit is a children's book (a phenomenal children's book) that is situated in this world. So much happens within the storyline of the book that is never mentioned. I think that the story has received a very necessary extension from the humble beginnings of the book. Everything that happened within the first 100 or so pages of the Hobbit was shown in this film, and the extensions were largely taken from the appendices of LOTR. I have seen a lot of people complain about the addition of Azog to the story, he is already well established in Middle Earth history, and although there have been changes to his story from the appendices, it is ultimately his (or his son's) army that acts in the battle of the 5 armies in the end of the book. It seems to me that people who are overly critical of this film know just enough about the Hobbit to know that there is extra material being used, but not enough to know that the majority of this is part of the Tolkien mythology, hence all the complaints. Even on the most basic level, the book to film transition needed more description and action, since most of this is never actually described in the book (Bilbo gets knocked out at the start of the battle and wakes up when it is over). A direct book to film change would have been no where near as exciting, which a film has to require, or people won't watch it!I loved this film, and I think that PJ has done an amazing job, and I can't wait to see what he will do with the next two.",9,4,7,13 September 2013
Sinister," Well executed, not so well written.
","This was an interesting, and at some moments very creepy film, that fell short of the mark with some poor writing.The film started very well, and the plot got off to an excellent start, the beginning scene was creepy straight away. I loved the idea of the film, with the crime writer discovering more grizzly crimes than he could have imagined. In the early parts of the film, the more that was uncovered the scarier the story became, suspense being built throughout, as we realise who the next victims will be.This was all done with no supernatural apparitions, or any hints of some sort of ghostly presence. I was beginning to think that maybe the film had nothing to do with ghosts or demons, which would have been a fantastic idea, and really scary. This was not the case. The more 'spooky' scenes that appeared the less believable the film seemed to become. Although a lot of these scenes were very jumpy, some of them were just downright weird.I can't help but feel that this film would have been amazing, if the ghosts had just stayed away, and the crimes were committed by a person, or group of people. The idea that those horrific crimes could have been done by normal human beings is much more scary than a demon doing it.I'm not sure if there was supposed to be a twist at the end or not, but if there was it was very predictable.Having said this, the film was still scary, and was good for the most part. The lead actor was great, and the various uses of the filming techniques and music really built tension in the night time scenes. It just went downhill after the first half, and could have been a great film had the story been slightly more well written.",9,3,5,27 September 2013
Pulp Fiction," Masterpiece
","There is no other word to describe this film. Everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion. There is humour, violence, shock, it has everything a film needs, and they are all portrayed in a sensational way. For people who haven't seen the film, it is a collection of stories, all jumbled out of chronological order, and all are somehow intertwined. The individual stories themselves are wonderful, and I would watch them on their own. The way that Tarantino has put all the stories together, so that we still aren't sure how they all connect until right at the end, is amazing. The film somehow has a gritty reality to it, even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous, they are believable all the same.The amazing thing is that Tarantino always manages to produce incredible films. This is IMO the best film that he has made (and probably ever made!), and for any fan, or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet, go out and buy it now!",10,1,3,20 September 2013
Monsters University," Enjoyable
","This film was great fun, very enjoyable and funny. The returning characters from Monsters Inc. were as good as they originally were, and I loved the small hints towards some of the main themes in the original. The story was solid, if very predictable, and the newer characters were well developed, and there were lots of funny moments. The character of Mike was very well developed, I like how they based the film around him, the first having Sully as the main character. His story was interesting, and there was a wonderful feel good vibe to the way that he realised his own talents. It just lacked something to make it live up to the quality of the original. There wasn't a lot of tension in it, I know it is a children's film but Monsters Inc. has brilliant tension. Maybe this was due to the fact that it is a prequel, and we know that Mike and Sully will be fine. I thought the ending was a little rushed. I felt it was a bit like they had written the film on as its own story, and then realised that they needed to find a quick way to get the characters into the job that they have in the original.Overall this is a really enjoyable film, with most of the aspects of the original held intact, any fan of the first will love it.",7,0,0,20 September 2013
