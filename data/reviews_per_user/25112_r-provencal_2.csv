Minority Report," visually stunning, intriguing characters
","Just saw the DVD and really enjoyed it. I had a few questions afterward (what's with the one-eyed scan in the pre-crime station? And why didn't it set off alarms when he used his severed eyeball to get into the nerve centre??) but I certainly wasn't as offended as other IMDB reviewers about the plotholes. Most movies with a fast-moving plot have them too, and some of them become huge fan favorites (Spiderman) or even Oscar winners (Titanic). In Minority Report I found a beautifully filmed thriller with a hint of film noir. The set designs are stunning, and the bleached look gives MR an Orwellian kind of a look. Even better, we meet a host of interesting characters along the way, each who steals the scene in which they're in. Those were the lasting impressions I have from MR. All in all, it ain't perfect, but it's a helluvalot better than most of the pap at the local cineplex.8/10",8,0,0,26 December 2002
The Iron Giant," a true gem
","I've just watched this film for probably the fifth time, and I must say it rates as one of the best animated films of all time. It's truly heart-warming and something you don't often find in animated features: it's REAL. The characters are actually believable. The film boasts rich and vibrant artwork. Its message is simple, yet effective. Warner Bros. should be ashamed it didn't put any effort in promoting The Iron Giant when it came out in '99. This rivals anything Disney has put out -- without the annoying show tunes. Easily 10 out of 10.",10,2,3,18 January 2003
