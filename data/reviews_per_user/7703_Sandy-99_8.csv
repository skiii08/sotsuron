The Avengers," It's the tesseract, stupid
","An amiable way to while away...how long was it? I found it less engaging than either Iron Man 1 or Thor, and whilst the dialogue interludes were welcome relief from all that crashing and banging, they didn't really go anywhere to help create believable characters. Not the point, perhaps: you can't create 'belief' in demi-gods and superheroes who are, to all intents and purposes, indestructible, by endowing them with mortal failings like arrogance, brotherly love, rage, patriotism and a desire to set the record straight? On the plus side, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk; stupendous effects (undermined by their ruthless efficiency - they're not special anymore) and a couple of good belly laughs; Scarlett Johansson in leather...",7,2,7,9 May 2012
Silent Hill," You can't make a film out of a video game
","Silent Hill attempts to overcome a simple, but almost insurmountable challenge: films and computer games are incompatible. They may draw on some of the same reference material and use similar techniques, but the single fundamental element of a game that makes the player persist to the point of addiction is that the player is personally involved: in films, it isn't. My own direct experience of games, and my observation of my sons' 'growth' from Sonic to Zelda to Silent Hill confirms this. It's me as Sonic/Link/Rose Da Silva; I must collect the rings/masks/clues; I am threatened by Robotnik/witches/the undead. My pulse rate rises, my palms sweat and I feel my chest tightening as my health meter runs down and I am failing to defeat the enemy.For this to be achieved in a movie, the writer/director must transfer your allegiance to someone else and since this instantly puts you out of danger, that transference is critical. When Ripley says 'Get away from her you bitch!' in 'Aliens', you want to cheer because you have been drawn not just into her world, but into her mind - her emotions, her fears, her maternal need to protect Newt. James Cameron and the writers fulfilled the first law of mainstream storytelling - make your audience identify with the protagonists. For Silent Hill to succeed, the writer and director have to solve this dilemma and also to resolve the other incompatibility which is that story is of secondary importance to a computer game. In a movie, story (and I don't just mean plot) is everything. Other gamers may disagree, but I don't believe that it is plot and character imperatives that drive you from level to level: it is the need to solve the next puzzle or meet the next 'boss' that is the prime motivator. Provided that you are happy with the overall playability, and the genre appeals, you'll keep playing. In fact, the cut scenes used to tell more story are a distraction and irritation, rather than a compulsion. Some of the best movies are very simple in plot terms (Jaws is a supreme example) but whether simple or complex, all succeed when storyline and characters are coherent and involving. In Silent Hill, the plot outline is simple enough. Rose must find out why her sleep-walking daughter cries out 'Silent Hill,' and, in going to the deserted town, puts both herself and Sharon in peril from an assortment of evil creatures, some infernal, some merely human: will she find Sharon and escape to safety? Had this been the single plot line, Silent Hill may well have worked. But in the opening scenes it fails in almost every respect to engage us with Rose or Sharon or Christopher. or to enlist our sympathy with the family's predicament. That leaves us with the secondary pleasure of enjoying the photography, sound and visual effects; checking the obvious connections with the game origins (running from room to room picking up useful objects and clues and meeting the occasional horror) or spotting the odd film reference - the Midwich School (for Cuckoos, presumably) and The Omega Man showing at the local multiplex.Horror fans will not be disappointed by the quantity of gore, and the appearances of Pyramid Head and the overtaking of the town by Darkness are very effective, but the plot-turn (you couldn't call it a twist) away from the infernal creatures towards the tediously conventional witch-hunting scenario is clumsy and all those who thought that Christophe Gans' promise that this would be something different might actually be realised are likely to be disappointed. Only the downbeat ending, which confirmed what some viewers failed to grasp earlier as the typical fantasy plot device of people searching in vain for each other in separate but parallel worlds, appeared to offer something out-of-the-ordinary. The trouble is that by then, I actually wanted the satisfyingly conventional: a reunion. Instead, I got a set-up for a sequel, one that, if it is to be any more successful, must either abandon the PC game roots or embrace them whole-heartedly and find a way to emulate the first-person visceral thrills. Might Peter Jackson et al achieve this with Halo? I can wait to find out!",6,0,2,23 April 2006
Life of Pi," Beautiful and engaging enough...but not much more.
","So, a young man, Pi, en route to Canada with his family and the remains of the zoo they have left behind in India, is shipwrecked along with a Bengal tiger. The focus of the movie is on Pi's manner of survival and his relationships with the vastness of the ocean and 'Richard Parker' - the tiger!This is a beautiful film - but in much the same way that an Attenborough documentary is beautiful. There are one or two spectacular effects which justify the use of 3D. But I'm not a fan of 3D and rather than increasing the feeling of involvement, I find it has a distancing effect, particularly when watching ordinary scenes of conversation between Pi and the writer, or Pi's family round the dinner table. The added perspectives seem artificial. Add to that the fact that you know from the beginning that he is rescued and the dramatic potential of the story was, for me, diminished. Whilst this meant that you could concentrate on his relationship with the tiger without distraction, it left me by the end wondering whether what I'd been watching had much meaning. The 'twist' in the tale seemed rather an afterthought, as did the notion that the whole movie had been some kind of allegory. Pi's question to the writer at the end - 'Which story do you prefer?' - seemed to carry insufficient weight for it to be the heart of the film. Although I enjoyed it, I nevertheless felt somewhat underwhelmed by it.",7,2,4,29 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," An awesome and terrible experience
","As a teacher, I know that one of my responsibilities is to ensure that children's sense of `Awe and Wonder' is allowed to flourish. The modern child seems so cynical and sophisticated that he can be very difficult to impress. When I was eight years old, a student teacher had tried to read The Hobbit to my class. I hated it. But seeing the BBC's 1968 radio adaptation of the story in Waterstone's when looking for something to listen to on my journey to work, (one which lasts an hour and a half, There and Back Again) I felt sure that I could overcome my prejudice. I did. I loved it. I was hooked. I wanted more. I bought the BBC's radio Lord of the Rings (1980) and was now a confirmed Tolkienite. Fascinated by the mythology, I visited the 'official' Tolkien website and discovered that a film was being made. However, having seen Peter Jackson's hand held close-up-to-the-nostril style in 'Braindead' and 'The Frighteners', I was somewhat fearful of what he might do to the Frodo, Gollum and Aragorn imagined in my head. When I downloaded the first trailer, my fears were allayed more than somewhat. The hairs prickled on the back of my neck. Alas, I knew that I was going to have to wait another eighteen months to see a film about a book that I hadn't read; that if I read it I might be turned by the Power of The One Book into a Tolkien geek (too late already) and then be disappointed by the changes I knew Jackson would have to make.I gave in of course, completing the trilogy last summer and rereading the Fellowship of the Ring this summer. Despite my enjoyment, Tolkien's writing leaves much to be desired and I became hopeful that a director who captured the spirit of the book rather than every dry detail would be doing us all a service.When last night, the hour finally arrived, I was not disappointed. No, it was not like the BBC's version which I have now listened to countless times. No, the book has not been translated directly to the screen without any changes. Jackson has taken a number of liberties with the book, but has in the process, produced a film that in many ways is superior in vision to that achieved by Tolkien himself.There is a theory that artists are not originators of their work, merely imperfect vessels for the expressions of universal truths. Whatever Tolkien may have intended by his book, there is a story, not necessarily his, to be imagined and reimagined by the readers, some of whom will baulk at seeing their version significantly altered. Perhaps the most obvious element missing in this film is the story and song, the literature and lore of Middle-Earth. But what is not only preserved, but magnified and rightly so, is the sense of a universe where the powers of good and evil, of nature and the landscape, are vastly greater than man can understand. Jackson's triumph is to have sewn this thread of truth into every frame, and, according to my wife, by no means a fan, `made it all look so real'. The essence of the book for me is epitomised by Gollum, a pathetic character so twisted by the lust for power that he has no control over his own destiny. We have yet to see his role fully revealed, but it is clear that Frodo, Aragorn and even Sam too are controlled by their fates. What Jackson has achieved is a realisation of the scale of the hidden forces which direct man in love, in battle, throughout life. It is the sweep and power of the opening battle which sets the tone for the whole movie, not just the narrative detail. The detail is almost irrelevant. It matters not that we do not see properly the individual thrust and parry of a fight, because this film is not about the mechanics of war. It is about the forces which drive man to wage war and which are beyond his understanding  the same force which drives man to fall in love, to lust for power, to procreate.It is a marvellous achievement. This film scores over almost every other that tries to grapple with the same themes. Star Wars, often quoted by those of short memory as the top movie of all time, does not come close in projecting the real, hidden powers of the universe. For all its talk of `The Force', it fails to convey half the passion and fear to be found in Fellowship. Star Wars is of course a different film  clever, knowing, a technical marvel, paying due allegiance to many other films and books, most notably Lord of the Rings. But Fellowship is not about special effects, or baddies and goodies in the simplistic sense, or buddy-buddies, or soap-opera moments (`I am your father Luke!'). If it lacks intimacy it is because it tries to get beyond the individuals that make up the story and instead visualise the unknowable meanings of life. A risky strategy, but one which works.Jackson delivers a hugely spiritual film; not the kind of spiritual experience that dopeheads declared Kubrick's 2001 to be, but with the same sense of awe which I must arouse in my schoolchildren; the same sense of the `terrible' (reach for your dictionaries folks) which filmmakers generally shy away from. `Awe and wonder' is a rather embarrassing and much underrated theme for filmakers in a post-modern world, which heaps endless praise on self-referential Tarantino movies. The grand and meaningful can seem so absurd that such films can only be made full of wise-cracks to make them accessible to the closed-minded. This epic is therefore only for the open-minded, the innocent, even the naïve, who are willing to allow `awe and wonder' to take over their lives for three hours. Like a six-year-old child, I can't wait for next Christmas.",10,0,0,24 December 2001
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A perfect adaptation of a great story
","An absolutely stunning fantasy adventure. I was enthralled from start to finish. Does it help to know the book, and the mythical background? Maybe, but I can't unknow it, whereas those ignorant of the story of how (and why) a wizard calls in on a homely hobbit to persuade him to go on a quest, have a choice.Great though the Lord of the Rings movies were, Jackson and his team have created a more complete fantasy world than was possible 10 years ago, and populated it with humour and humanity. As was the case with the last trilogy, the actors make a great ensemble, with enough strong performances to carry the story without any of them overwhelming. Where previously the studios were wary of making audiences sit through long movies, Jackson can here take his time, not just in expanding (not padding) the original tale with additional material that helps stitch the entire of Middle Earth into existence, but in allowing critical scenes time to unfold and draw you in.The action sequences are just mesmerising. Knowing that they are created with 'special effects' does not matter if you allow yourself the pleasure of wallowing in the details and being carried breathlessly through the backstory of the loss of the dwarfs' home of Erebor, and the fights with trolls, wargs and goblins.But the two most telling moments - proof that within this oft derided genre are the essentials of what story is about - are the most quiet. The scene where Bilbo and Gollum meet under the mountain for the first time climaxes with the critical moment for the whole of Middle Earth where the hobbit, hiding from Gollum, who is in turn hiding from the dwarfs, has the chance to kill the pathetic creature from whom he has obtained the ring. He changes his mind. But the most affecting moment for me came after the rumbustious goings-on when the dwarfs first arrive, and Bilbo wakes to find they have tidied up and gone, leaving him to his ordinary life. The silence ringing round Bag End is terrifying, and it is this realisation that he has lost his chance to live a real life that compels Bilbo to change his mind once more, and propel him out of the door.Now, to find a cinema where I can watch it again, this time in 48fps and 3D!",10,4,11,21 December 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Take time to ponder
","By this time last year, I had seen FOTR twice and contributed to several message board discussions. I rated it 10/10 and was of the firm opinion that it was the best movie that I had seen for a long time. I had no complaints about the differences between the screenplay and the book; the changes were appropriate, given the book's length, detail and differences of emphasis.Inevitably, the passage of time and further viewings at the cinema, on video and the extended DVD prompted further thoughts. Whilst Peter Jackson's film is exceptionally good, it is not flawless. The most significant is Elijah Wood's Frodo who is too passive and insufficiently worldly-wise. The frequent shots of his doe-eyed gaze into Middle-Distance suggest someone who is transfixed by and unreactive to, all that happens to him. Still, The Two Towers would surely see his gradual change to a more 'human' hobbit, as the ring increases its influence.I have so far seen The Two Towers only once. My first impression is that, whilst Peter Jackson has created a worthy sequel, its impact has been diminished simply because it was preceded by FOTR - the visual style, effects, characterisation, pace are now rather too familiar. This does not make TTT a bad film. Peter Jackson knew that this would be a problem and appears to have spent the last year fiddling to counteract it. The promise was that since all three films were 'made' at the same time, there would be a consistency that other similar projects lacked. This was of course not entirely true, and with so much post-production taking place after the release of FOTR, it is difficult to imagine that the director's work on TT was completely unaffected by the reception of its predecessor. Without the same impact, (or the hype!) the film can instead be considered on its merits. For example, has the aforementioned weak characterisation of Frodo been improved? At first viewing, only marginally so, but his anger at Sam in the ruins of Osgiliath promises further developments in the final film. If I were Peter Jackson, it is this that I would spend the next year fiddling with, and not the visual effects. Of course, if I was a 'Tolkien Virgin', I might have had a profoundly different view. My niece, who has not read the book and has seen FOTR only once, laughed aloud every time Gollum appeared. Her reaction, that he was a figure of fun, was completely at odds with mine, that he is a figure of pathos...but was I right to be irritated at her response?I would love to have been able to set aside my own familiarity with the books and previous dramatised versions and have come to these films afresh. Given that this is not possible, the best I can do is to take time to ponder; to see it again and not to leap to hasty conclusions as some other users seem to have done. I was certainly absorbed for three hours, and there was much to enjoy, as well as much to question, as others have done. For that reason, it will probably be a film that I will want to see not just once more, but many times more. I have no all-time favourite movie, although 'Oh Mr Porter!', a bargain I picked up on video this Christmas and which I have loved ever since I saw it as an eight-year old, offers endless charming amusement. Could The Two Towers occupy a similar place in my affections in another 40 years?Take time to ponder...",9,0,0,1 January 2003
The Artist," Emperor's New Clothes...not naked, but no Armani either!
","Having berated our local multiplex for initially refusing to screen this film, I was pleased to have the chance to view it, and was looking forward to a good night out. Of course, it's difficult to ignore the hype, but to take it on trust is a mistake. It just goes to show that you should read more about a movie before you go and see it. I was expecting some uproarious comedy, not some derivative homage to 'Ollywood. It was mildly amusing, with a winning performance by the dog, but the 'plot' was slight and I'm not sure I got it. The lack of dialogue deprived the characters of any depth or sympathy.'The Woman In Black' was more enjoyable, 'The Descendants' more worthy of recognition.There is a reason why no-one makes silent movies anymore, and why they are never screened on TV anymore. Talkies are superior. Alas, the Academy is filled with people who are unwilling to stand out from the crowd and point out that this Emperor may have been clothed, but ordinarily so.",5,2,8,3 March 2012
Prometheus," Exactly the same as 'the original'
","During the mid and late 1970s, cinema took a giant leap forward in its capacity to deliver blockbusters for teenagers (or the teenager in spirit). Doubtless those raised on the cinema of earlier generations might wish to make a similar claim for the sweeping epics that drew in the crowds in the 50s and 60s, but when I went to see Star Wars, Close Encounters and Alien in consecutive years, I was sure that Hollywood could not previously have made audiences so entranced and convinced by the sci-fi experiences now being created.Watching Alien in 1979 was, as one critic wrote at the time, a visceral experience: ghastly, scary, bloody, shocking and wholly believable. A full Odeon, Leicester Square was entranced as one.So I suppose it was inevitable that watching Prometheus was never going to be the same kind of experience for me: cinema just hasn't made that much progress since, partly because what CGI can now give us is the extraordinary made ordinary. Doubtless there are still some teenagers who will be coming to Prometheus fairly fresh and ready to be as gripped as I was by Alien, but raised on computer games and DVDs, such a number must be very small. They won't be disappointed by the movie's visuals: much time and effort was spent on creating a new hyper-real landscape, and there are still one or two moments of grisly horror (though none that genuinely surprise or shock).If only some time had been spent testing out the script's premise that a specially commissioned crew of experts in their fields would run around an alien landscape with no regard for their own or anyone else's personal safety, or for the success of their mission. Alien's miners could be forgiven for not knowing what they were getting into: these scientists have no excuse, yet Scott evidently decided that if he was to recreate the formula of the original, any such considerations would need to be set aside. They touch everything and seem afraid of nothing. Critics have described it as 'muddled', yet I would argue its worst crime was to attempt to revisit the same territory with an unconvincing script in the first place. The movie is, in basic structure and in a number of scenes, exactly the same as the original. (Perhaps it's me that's different.) Of the cast, only Theron, Rapace and Fassbender intrigue at all, and none matches up to the heroism of Ripley. Rapace fails to generate very much sympathy, despite her predicament - only Idris Elba offers much humanity or heroism, but he remains resolutely 2D.Perhaps that's the point. In presenting us with a collection of distinctly unlovable and more or less disposable characters, Scott underlines the revelation about the Engineers, their purpose and their secret, and mankind's insignificant and unsavoury role in Creation. To say more would be to give away the only thought worth pondering in a movie burdened with an expectation that, for this viewer, was unfulfilled.",7,190,361,7 June 2012
