Requiem for a Dream," a movie about addictions
","Its not a movie that everyone can like. It can be dark for some viewers... But I love this movie it totally gives some good messages! I recommend everyone to watch this movie. It's a good movie about addictions! A movie about the addictions that change people's lives, destroy a family, destroy relationships, destroy a person. The drug scenes were incredible. The way that pupils go bigger each time they take drugs. I think its a good way to show people that the addictions can ruin a person's life & a good way to show how dangerous an addiction can be!the title is related with the movie in a perfect way because in the movie all of them have their own dreams that ended in a bad way. That is why the movie is called 'requiem for a dream'. There is a sadness in them because they know they do something for their dreams but the thing they don't know is if they are doing the right thing.the songs in the movie is in a great harmony with the movie.The theme song has depressing parts,the parts that are more lively than the other parts just like the movie.I think it is a masterpiece about addictions.>DENIZ<",10,2,4,21 June 2006
