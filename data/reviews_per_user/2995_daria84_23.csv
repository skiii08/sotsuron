Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A masterpiece by Tarantino.
","I've been waiting to see this movie for so long, and when I finally saw it, I loved it! it was worth the wait.  Vol.2 picks up pretty much where Vol.1 left, except for some flashbacks explaining what really happened with the characters.  Uma Thurman is back as The Bride, and we get to know her real name finally.  Also Daryl Hannah comes back as Elle Driver, the one-eyed killer, Michael Madsen plays Budd, Bill's baby/loser brother, and the infamous Bill is played by David Carradine.  The performances are just great, Uma Thurman delivers a great performance as The Bride, we finally get to know her character a little better and the true reasons why she wants to 'Kill Bill'.  I also have to say that David Carradine was perfect to play Bill.  He has great charisma and he's so smooth, it's impossible not to like him.  Daryl Hannah's performance was great too, and Michael Madsen's too. Once again the music plays a key factor in this movie, is very well selected and for every single scene the music fits perfectly.  And of course, the dialogue.  In this movie, we get a lot more dialogue than brutal fighting like in Vol.1, this movie is more centered in explaining what led Bill to do what he did, it pretty much focuses in the past, explaining the whole thing. I especially liked the dialogues between Bill (Carradine) and The Bride (Thurman), I thought they were clever and just great, like all Tarantino's dialogues.  Also the locations were excelent, I have no idea where they shot the film, but the landscaping was great, I truly enjoyed it.Well it would be better to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as one movie, not different, because in the end, you must see them together to understand.  So I give this movie a 10/10, I loved it, it was great, great dialogues, great performances, great fighting sequences, everything was great! And I think that Uma Thurman and/or David Carradine (at least him) should be nominated for an Oscar, they were perfect and they deserve that international film makers acknowledge that. Tarantino you are the best!!!",10,93,153,1 September 2004
The Ring," Totally Twisted
","this movie is indeed one of the most frightening movies ever!  I haven't had the chance to rent the Japanese version; however, I thought this movie was very well done.It's about a tape that if you see it, you die in 7 days; and then a reporter tries to uncover the true behind the cursed tape, and since she watched it, with her ex-boyfriend and later her son, she must find the true or else they will be dead.The acting is all right, is not fabulous but it's not bad either, Naomi Watts, who plays Rachel, does an ok job.  She is great in some parts, and in others she is just not into it.  Martin Henderson, Noah,  is good too in what he does, but they could have done a far better job with the acting.
Now the directing and the plot, that is awesome!  It's very twisted and sometimes even complicated to understand, it leaves a lot of 'holes' in the story, and that is good, because you keep wondering what happened, what will happen.
Well this is a great horror movie, it's been a while since they made a film actually scary and not grotesque like all the others involving murders, curses and lots of dead people and blood.  I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",Null,1,1,26 March 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The best adventure movie of the year!
","So far I have seen this movie 2 times and I can't get enough of it.  This movie is so great, it's so well done, Gore Verbinsky (sp?) has done an outstanding job directing this film, his skills to tell stories and to make them look amazing is shown here.  The story is about a curse upon the Black Pearl and their crew, they search the way to get rid of the curse.  The characters are very well developed, everybody in the cast makes does a great job portraying their characters. Especial mention to Johnny Depp, who does a great performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, his accent, way to express himself and even his aspect is so real!  Orlando Bloom does a good job as well, as Will Turner, and of course, the great Geoffrey Rush, one of the best actors at the moment.  I just love every single one of his movies, and this one is one of his bests.  He is so convincing as the evil captain of the Black Pearl Barbossa, he's one of those villains who are extremly evil, yet charming.The especial affects are unbelievable, it is great to see some pirates become skeletons and suddenly change to their human shape.  ILM did an awesome job in this movie.  The music is also a key thing in the movie, it's just perfect, it suits to every single scene of this movie. 
As a summary, I believe this is probably the best movie of the year (Adventure genre that is), this is definitely a must see for everybody, kids, old people, teenagers, everybody will enjoy this movie. 10/10",9,0,0,14 September 2003
The Mummy," A Modern Classic!
","This movie is meant to be a classic.  It is so ingenious and good that makes you watch it over and over again!I actually watched this movie 6 times in the theaters, and then I bought the video and I lost count of how many times I have seen this movie.It is about an Egyptian high priest Imhotep, who was caught having an affair with the Pharaoh mistress and consequently was punished with death and a curse.  Then many centuries later, adventurer Rick O'Conell discovers him with Evy, and archeologist, Jonathan, her greed brother, and a group of Americans seeking for fame an glory.This movie is great, the cast is so good, I never heard of any of them before this movie, except for Brendan Fraser who was in the super famous 'George of the Jungle' movie.  Anyways the performances are vey convincing, Brendan Fraser is great as handsome hero, Rachel Weisz is great as Evy, a clumsy but very intelligent egyptologist, John Hannah delivers the humor in this movie as Jonathan, the good-for-nothing guy who only cares about money, I have to mention Oded Fehr too, he was pretty good as the mysterious and attractive Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Mejais who is in charge to put the mummy back in his grave, and how can I forget the Mummy himself, Arnold Vosloo, who was, without any doubt, the best one in this movie. His performance is so good as the evil and sexy high priest Imhotep, he doesn't make you hate him, he makes you feel sorry for him!  That is what I call 'acting skills'.The plot is good, it's not a cheezy-horror flick or something like that, and the dialogues are awesome too :) Let's not forget the direction, Stephen Sommers does a great job.  And special mention to the music, by Jerry Goldsmith, it was one of the best parts of this movie.You get a lot of 'candy eye' in this movie, for guys and girls, for guys you get Rachel Weisz and in the beginning of the movie you see the Venezuelan top-model Patricia Velazques as the unfaithful Anck-su-namun; and for girls you get Brendan Fraser, Oded Fehr and of course Arnold Vosloo.Anyways I highly recommend this movie, THIS IS A MUST-SEE. ***** out of *****",Null,10,10,1 April 2003
X-Men," 'join he evolution'
","I didn't see this movie in the theaters when it was first released, and now I am so regret I didn't see it at the movies!  This movie has so many special effects that it would have been a lot better if I would have gone to see it in the movies.  Anyways I rented this movie like a year after its release, and I totally blew me away!I have always been a fan of the series (the old ones, 'X-men, evolution' is kinda stupid), so I know quite a bit about the story line and the characters; and this movie didn't disappoint me one bit.  It is very well written and the characters are portrayed excellent.  Especial mention to Sir Ian McKellen, whose performance of 'Magneto' was the most convincing performance in the whole movie.  Patrick Stewart was excellent too, the director of casting did a great job, nobody could have done that role better than him. Hugh Jackman was pretty good as Wolverine too, just like in the comics, a bad-a$$ guy with a bad attitude, but with good intentions.  Anna Pakin was great as Rogue too, she was still insecure of her abilities and she shows her emotions (fear, insecurity) very well.  James Marsden was ok as Cyclops, he could have done way better though.  I was a little dissapointed not to see some of my favorite X-men in the movie, like Gambit, thus movie would have been even better if Gambit would have been in the story.  Well the plot is great, the dialogs are even better, some people say they were cheesy, I really don't think so, or maybe it was that the performance was so good that I don't even noticed.  The music was very good too, and also the direction.Well I definitely loved this movie, it's one of the greatest movies that come from a comic (especial mention to Superman I & II, Batman I & II, and Spider-man).  This is a must-see, whether you have seen or read the comics before, I highly recommend everybody to see it! ****1/2 out of *****",8,0,0,4 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Master George Lucas
","Well, So far I've seen this movie 2 times. The first time I hated it! I really don't know why, maybe it's because I went with a friend who has never seen Star Wars, so I was bored. Anyway then i went with my aunt, who is a mega star wars fan, (and so am i) and wow!! I enjoyed it so much!!! This one is way better than Episode I, yeah we don't have Liam Neeson this time, a real shame, it would have been great to see him as an spirit, you know, lie Obi Wan in Return of the Jedi. Anyway this movie has a lot of cool moments and lame moments, a lot of cool special effects and explains a lot of things that you wanted to know since you saw episode IV, V or VI. here are some cool things:                           ******** SPOILER *************YODA RULES!!! he gets to fight the bad guy in the end, Anakin and Obi Wan tried to stop Dooku (sp?) but Obi was wounded and Anakin lost is right arm, and then  Yoda comes.. WOW!!!  who could have ever imagined to see that little guy doing so many cool things?? Kamino is a creepy planet isn't it?? Well the whole 'falling in love' part between Anakin and Padmé is really lame and boring, the landscapes are great, but Anakin and Padmé are just boring there!  The part when Anakin rescues his mom, that one is great! it gives you an idea of why Anakin became Vader.. A jedi is not supposed to feel hate, Anakin was full of hate and anger, and a Jedi is not supposed to fall in love, Anakin gets married for God's sake! what kind of jedi is he anyway??  A BAD ONE! with great powers but with a great attitude problem too!
                          *******************************All performances are great, Obi-Wan is cool, as always! Once again, Ewan McGregor plays his role very well! Padmé is much better in this one than in Episode II, we get to see her in action! Natalie Portman makes her performance really believable. Anakin was really annoying!! which means that Hayden did his job well because young anakin is supposed to be arrogant, and believe me, he is! All the others are great too, Samuel L. Jackson and everybody else :) I would say that if you are somebody who enjoys action movies, you will love this one, but if you are the type of person who analyzes every single detail of movies and you only like intellectual movies, you are going to hate this one. so, ENJOY AS MUCH AS I DID!!!",Null,0,0,22 July 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Arnold is back, better than ever!!!
","T3 : The rise of the Machines has been released last friday and I've seen it 2 times already, I can't get enough of this movie!  It is so great, it is indeed the best movie of this year so far.  The movie is set 10 (I think) years after the last one, John Connor is now a grown man who escapes his destiny, but is found by the T-X, a female terminator with the most advanced technology ever seen.  But also, , the T-100 is sent (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to protect John and Kate Brewster. 
it' is an awesome movie, the best of it it's that it combines suspense, non stop action, some emotion and humor :)  Arnold delivers a great performance, as always.  Nick Stahl is pretty good and very convincing as John Connor, and Claire Dannes does a great job as well.  Especial mention to Kristianna Loken as the female terminator,  her character is very convincing and she manages to show a total lack of emotions and feelings, just the way a Terminator should be.  Plus the plot is great, the dialogs are clever and the many twists of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie!All of those who love a good action movie, and especially, love Arnold, see it!!!  You will love it!",7,0,0,4 August 2003
BASEketball," HILARIOUS!!!
","I saw this movie b/c I had nothing to do actually, at first I didn't want to see it b/c I thought it was stupid, but anyways, I started to see it and I totally loved it!!! It was so hilarious, the whole idea of the movie is original, and although the performances are not the best in the world, the actors are great in each role they play, especially Trey Parker.  Of course sometimes the movie is kinda cheesy, but it's much, pretty much all the time. The dialogs are funny, and most of all the situations where the main characters get involved. Anyways if you want to laugh a lot, and if you are not the type of person who gets offended by everything (language most of all, oh and some scenes....) then you must see this movie!!!",8,0,2,14 October 2002
Resident Evil," ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIMES!!! *spoilers*
","This movie was so awesome!! I thought it was going be one of thise cheesy-horror flicks, but it really surprised me, I mean for the first time ever I actually got scared!!! The make-up it's great, all the zombies look real and they are scary believe me! The performances were good, well Jovovich was great, her character is really well developed, but Raine (Rodriguez) is more like a man than a girl, I mean they tried to make her tough but she looks ridiculous acting like a guy. All the other members of the cast we very good too :)*SPOILERS*..... The best thing about this movie is that it has no mercy with anybody!!! I mean we all thought that all the good guys, ALL of them were going to survive, WRONG!!! it's not like the classic movie where all the good guys survive or it has a happy ending, believe me, the ending is not happy at all!!*******Anyways I'm really looking forward to see Nemesis next year, I hope the Director can actually make Nemesis look real and scary.. Two Thumbs up 4 this movie!!! I give it a 9/10",Null,0,0,9 October 2002
Amadeus," The best musical ever made!
","Indeed! this movie will blow you away! of course for all the people who like this genre of music and moviesThis is the way movies should be, no special fx that makes you dizzy in the middle of the movie, just acting! Well the movie is about the life of Wolfang Amadeus Mozart (duh!) with his wonderful music and great script. Great performances and the costume designer was brilliant.F. Murray is just excellent! he plays so well his role as the jealous and insane Salieri! and Tom Hulce, he's a master, his performance of Mozart is just great. All the movie is really good, I highly recommend it. ***** / *****",10,2,4,8 December 2004

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," And we have a winner!!
","I can not believe I've been avoiding to see this movie only b/c of the suggestive title!  I always thought that a movie called 'kill bill' would be as dull as the title, I was so wrong!!! I'm not a Tarantino fan, in fact, I've never seen any of his movies, so I had no clue what this movie was going to be like, in fact, I never even saw a trailer from this movie!So anyways this movie is so packed with action from the beginning until the very end!  It doesn't have a very big plot, it's all about revenge and how to perform it.  But whatever lacks in plot, this movie makes up in action and the screenplay!  it is so good!  Even for simple things like 'pussy wagon', it's just great! so clever, so creative, so original!
Well, Uma Thurman is perfect as 'the bride', she's so versatile, when she needs to show anger, she does, when she needs to show sorrow, she does, and when she needs to show brutality, SHE DOES INDEED!  Lucy-Liu was so good as O-Ren Ishii! Another member of the deadly Viper team,  that you end up liking her.  I never expected to see her playing a character like O-Ren, such a change! but that shows how great Lucy Liu is! not only she can play an Ally McBeal lawyer lol, but also an evil and ruthless yakuza boss and mercenary!  I also enjoyed very much Vivica Fox' performance, even though she had a small part, but it was pretty good!  Daryl Hannah was outstanding in her very small part as Elle Driver, my favorite scene is when she shows up! (you know when, i'm not going to spoil it!).  I haven't had the chance to see David Carradine as Bill yet, but I guess it'll be terrific. And i have to mention the girl who plays Gogo, I have no idea what her name is, but wow! she was very well casted as O-Ren's lunatic bodyguard!  Only by her eyes,m you can tell that she doesn't know the meaning of the words 'compassion or fear'!  Bravo to her!Well the music is great, very well picked for every scene and situation, the characters are very interesting, each one of them, even the ones that are not that important.  I definitely loved the screenplay, the dialogs are smart, I didn't find not even one unnecessary line.  The locations are equally good, the costumes (the Bride's final suit, the yellow and black one is a-w-e-s-o-m-e!).  I just put it simple:  this movie is well done in every sense!This movie is indeed my favorite movie right now!!  10/10 PS: if blood scares you, AVOID THIS MOVIE! lol",10,0,2,15 May 2004
The Mummy Returns," Pretty good for a sequel.
","This movie is pretty good, it delivers pretty much the same thing we got in the Firs movie.  Some characters are more developed and some others more expanded, all the same, some others are reduced and we are introduced to new characters.  The plot is good, not as good as the first movie, but still does a good job keeping you interested and entertained the whole time. 
The sequel takes place 10 years later, when Rick O'Conell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) are now married, and have a son, Alex (Freddie Boath).  Alex has been kidnaped by the bad guys, including the infamous Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and his eternal love reincarnated (Patricia Velazques).  Now it's just a matter of time for them to find Alex before it's too late for everybody...The performances are pretty good, almost all of them.  Brendan Fraser does a good job once again as the handsome Rick, he is strong, funny, charismatic, what else can you ask?  Rachel Weisz role has been developed a lot more, she is no longer the clumsy egyptologist wanna-be, now she runs the British museum and is a mom; and she does a great job with that.  John Hannah is also back as  the useless Jonathan, this time not as funny as he used to be. Oded Fehr  character has been expanded a lot, we get to see him a lot more in this movie.  He did a good job as Ardeth.  One more time, the winner of this movie is Arnold Vosloo as the villain; his performance was excellent! He manages to express all the emotions without opening his mouth!  This guy has great acting skills, too bad not many movie producers/directors have noticed it.  The Rock does his movie debut with this movie, he is the Scorpion King, the whole movie turns around him, even though he was in the movie for the first 5 minutes of it.  Still he did a good job for his first time.  Patricia Velazques was the only one who did a BAAAAD job.  Her acting is awful! She is pretty and everything, but she really needs some acting classes.The music once again is one of the key parts of this movie, it is really good, even though Jerry Goldsmith wasn't in charge of it. The direction is good too, just like in the first movie, and we get to see a lot more of special effects.This movie is good, i really enjoyed it, I liked the first one better though, but that's just me.  You might like this one better, so YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE! **** out of *****",8,41,48,7 May 2003
Reservoir Dogs," Who would think that such a simple plot could turn out so good?
","I watched this movie a couple of months ago for the first time ever, before I became a QT fan, I never heard of this movie. When I first saw it, I understood why this movie launched him to fame, simply because it is so good!The whole thing is about a bunch of professional thieves unrelated to each other, planning to make a big robbery guided by a Mobster (that would be my guess) and his son. But when things get messed up during the robbery, the movie really starts.I thought the dialogues were excellent, I loved them! Especially the whole 'like a virgin' thing and Mr. Pink's 'I don't tip' thing, it was hilarious. Also the cast was excellent, I loved every single one of them, Harvey Keitel as Mr. White was so good! also Michael Madsen, as Mr. Blond, everybody's favorite 'dog' was so great, like QT said in the making of Kill Bill 2 'Michael is like the king of *being cool* in movies' and he is indeed. Also Tim Roth was good as Mr. Orange, and Steve Buscemi was my favorite as Mr Pink. QT also had a small part on this movie as Mr. Brown, his acting was good too. Anyways the story may seem simple, way to simple, but the screenplay is so very well written and the whole movie is so well directed, that it doesn't matter anymore. I love this movie and anyone who enjoys action movies and good dialogues, must see this movie. ****1/2 out of *****",9,1,3,22 October 2004
Pulp Fiction," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","Well I just saw Kill Bill, and I became a big Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman fan.  So I heard a lot about this movie, and I bought it.. at first I didn't get it very well because I had no idea what it was about, I never heard about the plot or anything, (yeah, this movie is like 10 years old and I saw it a couple of weeks ago).  Anyways I was so glad I bought it! I even bought the soundtrack, it's just so good!  it's amazing how Quentin Tarantino has a natural skill to tell a story that, if someone else would have told it, it would be dead boring or just stupid..  I noticed that in both Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, all the dialogues are absolutely necessaries!  You won't see stupid phrases like in horror movies when the killer is approaching and they say 'ruuuun!' d'oh! of course u have to run, there's no need to say it!!-  here, if you take away one single dialogue, the whole thing falls apart.So the casting is perfect, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, etc... they were all great, the careers of all these actors turned to a different direction after this movie, for good of course, for all of them (especially Travolta who was dead for Hollywood and thanks to this movie he's still around).  Also Harvey Keitel, even his character didn't have a lot of screentime, he did great, he's my favorite. 
Well the music is perfect, it fits every single scene (special mention to that song 'you'll be a woman soon'), etc...  Well it's a great movie, and it's definitely right to be #16 in the list and no wonder why it won the best picture at the Cannes festival back in 1994, TWO THUMBS WAAAY UP!",10,1,2,25 July 2004
The Da Vinci Code," Now I understand the need for so much publicity
","This movie needed the publicity to get people to see it. And with that and trailers and all of that, you could get the idea that was going to be one of those movies that you'd have to see at the movies, at least, 2 times. I went to the movies to see it with high high expectations, boy was I disappointed or what? Bad acting, bad dialoge, weak script, and looooooooooooooong, by the near end of the movie all I could think was 'please roll credits!' I know it was a thriller, but I think they sold the idea of the whole 'Christ is not what you think he is' so much that all we cared about was that, an explanation. The rest was just filling. I think the whole explanation is about 30 mins and the rest is them getting chased by cops.I'd have to say that the only one with a good performance was Sir Ian McKellen, he was good and believable, well Paul Bettany was good too, not great. Tom Hanks disappointed me so much, it's the first time I have to complain about his acting. You couldn't believe him for a second. And Audrey Tatou either, she was terrible! jean Reno was all right, not bad but not great either.I'm a Catholic and the reason I say this movie is bad has nothing to do with the concept of the movie, as a matter of fact, I found it quite interesting, plus I don't care what people say or don't say or he Church or whatever about Jesus, you either believe or you don't, it's up to you and it depends on how easy is to manipulate your faith. Go and see this movie or wait until it comes out to video, and 'find out the truth' The Da Vinci code is a lame movie.",1,35,72,21 May 2006
Love Actually," A 'lovely' movie
","I wanted to see this movie a long time ago, unfortunately, here in my country it was released like 3 months ago rather than being released in Christmas..  Pretty much all my favorite actors are in this movie, I couldn't believe when I saw Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Allan Rickman and Rowan Atkinson in the same movie!! I had to see it, and I was not disappointed one bit, it was great!It's 8 movies in one! 8 different stories, all of them totally different, with different stories and different protagonists,  but somehow they're linked..  Well besides of the wonderful cast and crew, the plot is pretty good for every single one of the stories, the actors and actresses do a great role in everything they have to do (special mention to Colin Firth, Hugh Grant and Liam Neeson).  Also I very much enjoyed that guy who played Karl, the graphic designer guy, he is from Brazil i think, he's in a brazilian 'novela', and I thought he was great, and very good looking :PSo, I highly recommend this movie, some people might get offended by some scenes around there (I won't spoil it) but still, I think it's a must-see movie, for people who enjoy cute love stories :) ****1/2 out of *****",Null,0,3,28 July 2004
Downfall," The best Hitler movie ever made!
","I've always been a big fan of WWII movies, and mostly, I've always found Hitler to be one interesting character to read about, I've always wanted to know his motivations that lead him to do all those horrible things. Well I have read a lot about him, and watched a few movies about WWII and about him, and every time I would, they portrayed a Hitler who was more like a killing machine or robot, instead of a human being. Which led me to the question: Why did Germans trust this man? How did a man like that, cold and pure evil, could get the sympathy of a country and become what he became?In this movie, lots of answers can be found. First of all, Hitler's human, what do you know! A charismatic guy, who sure has his rage outbursts, but who also is a man who laughs, smiles, cries, etc.. For example **********spoilers***********At the beginning of the movie, when Traudl would do her 'trial' for being Hitler's secretary, she kinda messes up and closes her eyes waiting for Hitler to yell at her or something like that. Well no, he acts really good and just tells her to try again. From that point on, I knew this wasn't going to be just 'another Hitler movie', but something completely different.********* end of spoiler *******I loved the acting, Bruno Ganz was terrific, I hate the fact that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for best performance. Anyways he's great, completely flawless, great intensity into the character, it's almost like he met Hitler. All the other actors where terrific as well, the music in the movie is great, everything. 2 thumbs up for this movie, the best foreign film of all times for me!

","I just saw this movie a couple of hours ago, and I thought it was so good! It's about some people who get trapped in a motel in the middle of a storm, and then 'people started dying...' If I reveal more of the movie, it'll be a spoiler, so let's just leave it like that.... All I can tell you is that, well, maybe they didn't use big FX and stuff, so what??  The performance of every single one of the characters compensate that!  Special mention to Ray Liotta and of course John Cusack.  All the others were pretty good too.  The plot is pretty good, not new to hollywood, but still is very good, and add to that a great twist in the plot (I love twists).

Except from some little things that weren't good, like Billy's (Sean William Scott) lines that were supposed to be funny but they weren't, this movie was good!The whole movie is about this kid who has a vision of something terrible that is about to happen and avoids that situation with some other people, but once he discovers that 'you can't cheat death' things start to get interesting..The acting is good, and the fx were even better! I loved the plane scene, it was very very well done.

Jackie Brown," A movie with Tarantino's signature everywhere!
","I just saw this movie a couple of days ago, and I thought it was very good! Again I had no idea what it was about, and in the beginning it goes a little slow and confusing, but then it gets bigger and better!Th plot is very complicated, a flight attendant, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) helps this gun sales man, Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) to bring his illegal money from Mexico to the US, but she gets caught by the federals (played by Michael Keaton and some other guy, the guy who played Buck in Kill Bill Vol. 1).  It pretty much takes off from there, with lots of twists in the plot and playing with one of the worst human feelings, greed.I liked everybody's performances in this movie, especially Pam Grier's and Jackson's.  The story is great, the characters are interesting and the screenplay is great too! lots of clever dialogues.  Now I am a big Quentin Tarantino fan, and I'm sure that if I wasn't, i would have never rented this movie, but I sure liked it!  I give it a 8/10.",Null,0,1,1 September 2004

It was everything you could possibly want from an epic adventure!The story is about a man, General Maximus (Russel Crowe) who has been betrayed by the new Emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), whose family was killed and turned from a General of the Roman Empire to a Gladiator; and now seeks for revenge.The plot is outstanding, it is very well written, and it has a lot of historical background.  Even though is not 100% accurate, it is excellent. The performances were good as well, Russel Crowe did deserve the Oscar for this movie, he made us be on the brink of our seat the whole movie.  Joaquin Phoenix was equally good as Commodus, his performance is so convincing that you actually end up hating him.  All the rest of the cast were equally good, most of all Richard Harris and Oliver Reed.The music of this movie is possibly one of the most important parts of it, it is perfect in every single situation.  The special effects were outstanding, we get to see the glory of Rome back in those days.This movie is a must see, however; if you are looking for a movie based 100% in history facts, watch the History Channel instead.  If you want to have a great time, watch this movie.  ***** out of *****",8,0,1,7 May 2003
Dodgeball," Hilarious!
","Wow it's been a while since the last time I laughed this hard at the movies. I loved it!This movie is about a group of 'weird' (I hate to see that word in a sentence next to the word 'people') guys who work out at a small gym owned by Peter LaFleur (Vince Vaughn), which isn't getting any income b/c it's going to be taken by the bank, task handed to Kate Votch(Christine Taylor). But that isn't all, the gym wants to be owned by the annoying/gross and long time rival of Peter, owner of Globo gym, White Goodman (Ben Stiller in I think one of his best roles ever). The thing is this guys are willing to do anything to keep the gym, they learned to love that place and they made a bunch of great friends. Anyhow, the only way to keep the gym is to get $50.000 in 1 month, and that's how they get into 'dodgeball..' The rest, you have to see it.A really fun movie, wonderful performances by everybody in the cast, I can't complain of anyone, they were all awesome! Especially Ben Stiller, we're used to see him in roles like 'There's something about Mary' as a sweet good guy, but in this one, forget about it! He's nasty, dumb (not the Zoolander kind of dumb, this one is actually funny) and annoying! But that was the character, so I'd say Ben Stiller was perfect. Vince Vaughn was great too, funny and the classic good guy/hero of the movie, I liked him. Christine Taylor was good too :)I'd watch this movie again anytime, one of the best comedy movies I've seen in a long time :) ****1/2 out of ***** (the half point taken away by David Hasselhoof's came, I have no idea what he was doing or why he was there, but it was stupid and not fun).",9,5,10,15 November 2004
