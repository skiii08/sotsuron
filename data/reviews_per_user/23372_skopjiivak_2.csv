National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Okay Movie
","For me this movie wasn't that great. It seemed to me that it constantly struggled with wnating to be supernatural while being blatantly serious and stuck in reality. The plot and story was exactly like the first and connections could be seen from far away.as for acting, i'm not a huge fan of nick cage at all. Although this movie didn't sway my liking of him, the directors seemed to keep his acting to a minimum as most of the story is driven by whats going around nick cage then cage himself.Over all i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, but i wouldn't say that its awful. If you have nothing else to watch then it will pass the time, but nothing i owuld buy or see in the movie theater (which i did...)",5,1,2,5 January 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," An awkward blend of action, comedy, and slow mo
","This movie is clearly aimed towards 10-25 year old kids (mostly boys) and if the goal of the movie was the hit its target audience then I guess it succeeded. However the movie is far from sci-fi greats such as Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, and Jurassic Park. Now its highly unfair to rate this movie to those but I want to make perfectly clear that most people outside the target zone will find this movie a bore.At 2 and half hours long this movie could easily be cut down in length, and while watching it the viewer could pick out scenes that could be thrown out to do just that. The movie's constant random humor (from parents getting high to a giant robot having balls located in certain region) greatly takes away from a decent story and beautiful action scenes and computer visuals. I feel that if the movie would have removed those scenes I would be giving this a 7 or 8. But when a movie has not 1 but 2 jar jar binks in it, I struggle to give it a good rating.As for the fun factor, if you're looking for time to kill, or are dying to see this movie, See it in theaters. The visuals wont hold up at home so find a day where your theater has discount days and see it then.This movie is far from the best i've ever seen but its not the worst. If you're looking for an awkward blend of comedy and slow-mo, then try not to pay more than 8 dollars seeing this movie.",5,3,9,24 June 2009
