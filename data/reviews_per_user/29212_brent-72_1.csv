Requiem for a Dream," Gorgeous
","I highly suggest anyone with an open mind see this film.  It is not for everyone, though.  Most of the people I saw it with did not like it very much.  However, once it was over, I was very moved by it, not knowing whether to burst into laughter or into tears.  It is probably the best cinema experience I have ever had and quite possibly the best film I've seen ever, and definately the best one I've seen this year.  Open your eyes and go see it.",10,0,0,11 November 2000
