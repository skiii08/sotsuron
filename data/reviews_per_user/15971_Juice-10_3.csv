The Blair Witch Project," Don't believe the hype
","This movie was beyond bad, if not for an interesting ending that left you asking, is that it? It's not the fact that they had no budget that makes this movie terrible, it is very groundbreaking in a way. Are we really supposed to be scared by wooden people hanging in the woods, this movie created no real tone or mood for me, nothing is explained and everything comes across as stupid. The female lead does a good job of acting but her scream will almost make you want to run out of the theater. For your own sake don't go see this movie if you're expecting a classic horror pick because you will be let down. 6 out of 10",6,0,2,4 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The greatest animated satirical film of the decade!
",South Park chimes in on target with its plot line of Entertainments effect on kids. This is one funny movie and there's no denying it. The kids sneak into an 'R' rated Terrance and Phillip movie (just like many kids will sneak in more than likely to see the South Park movie). Before they know it they are singing such catchy tunes from the movie as 'Uncle Fu#$er'. This is truly a great movie and contrary to prior reports it does not drag towards the end. Look for a love relationship with Sadaam and Satan that will split your sides. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have definitely made their point with this movie now all of you have to go find out for yourselves! 9 out of 10,10,0,0,4 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A sleek sexual thriller and a fitting end to a Legend
","Eyes Wide Shut is a great movie, far from perfection but good none the less. This is a well put together movie although it really drags in some spots. The biggest disappointment would be the revelation at the end, it in a way is not nearly as interesting as the movie itself. Although not for mainstream this EWS will find its fans, especially Kubrick fans. I had to give it an 8 out of ten",8,2,3,8 July 1999
