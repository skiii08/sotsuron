Ali," good performances by Smith, and Voight
","The best thing about the movie was the performance by Will Smith as Ali, and Jon Voight did a wonderful job of playing Howard Cosell. I thought the film tended to drag, especially in the first part, it focused too much on Malcolm X. The last half of the film seemed to flow better, and was much more entertaining.",5,0,0,5 July 2002
