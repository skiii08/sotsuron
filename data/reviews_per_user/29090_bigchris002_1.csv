The Hangover," Outperformed the already high expectations!
","I have to start by saying that my friends and I have been talking about this movie and watching the trailers for weeks, so our expectations were really high.With that being said, this movie didn't just live up to the expectations, it was one of the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms are all very good. Galifianakis steals the show at times. It is hilarious from the beginning. Mike Tyson brings a few laughs and Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) is a great twist. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie, it is worth every penny. Just got out of the midnight showing and I'm going back tomorrow night.",10,277,517,5 June 2009
