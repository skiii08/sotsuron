Requiem for a Dream," Brilliant, Original, Riveting
","Requiem for a Dream is unlike any other film I have seen before. When I initially began watching it, I had no idea what to expect. Within less than five minutes, I knew I was watching something different.
Director Aronofsky employs erratic, chaotic, editing styles to piece together a puzzle about the pains of addiction. The film follows 4 individuals who are closely related. A son, his mother, his girlfriend and his best friend. The films carries us through their tales of addiction and destruction. By the end of the film you will feel as if you have been to hell and back. Aronofsky obviously makes no effort to use subtext or subtle means to get his points of self-destruction across. Many times in the film I found myself cringing openly at the graphic images. This is surprising considering the amount of conditioning we have towards violence and sex. Take heed: this film is a very graphic and realistic(or at least I think so) depiction of the downward spirals of 4 individuals. This is not a family film.In conclusion I must commend the cast on an absolutely brilliant job. All four main characters come in crystal clear with excellent performances. Hats off especially to Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly. Marlon is a great actor and it is good to see him in more serious roles. Jennifer did an overall excellent job. Go see this movie!P.s. This film inspired me to never go near any drugs, ever.",Null,0,1,20 January 2004
