Walk the Line," Fantastic portrayal of Johnny Cash
","I'm watching this movie again and really enjoy it, I always liked these biographical type movies. I never liked Joaquin Phoenix much, he always seemed to play creepy roles, like in Gladiator and Buffalo Soldiers, but he was terrific in this movie. I'm amazed at some of the comments by people who don't like the movie because he doesn't look like Cash, or the guy who played Elvis didn't look like Elvis, etc. It's the portrayal of the person that should count, not the physical resemblance. Phoenix did an amazing performance as Johnny Cash. Did anybody hate Gary Busey as Buddy Holly, Sissy Spacek as Lorretta Lynn, Dianna Ross as Billie Holliday, Jessica Lange as Patsy Cline, or Larry Parks as Al Jolson? (That's going way back) None of those actors 'Looked like' the performers they portrayed but all did amazing and memorable performances. Everybody is entitled to their opinions, but I liked this movie. I always enjoyed Johnny Cash music, I'm old enough to remember seeing him, I have the Folsom Prison album on vinyl, who doesn't?",10,0,0,5 October 2006
