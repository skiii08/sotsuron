The Incredible Hulk," Underrated and also forgettable
","I heard a lot of how bad this movie is and feels disjointed to the vast MCU. I agree but feel it is mostly because of Norton- Mark Ruffalo situation.When I first saw it was a good CBM, but felt very formulated 3-piece film. I am happy how they handle the origin, gamma exposure screens, quick and done cuz we have see it numerous times.Except Ross no one returns in future and I doubt many people who saw Civil war knew who he was from, let Red Hulk comeout (Hope She-hulk delivers)After many months the only scenes I vivdly remember are Hulk claps to blow away fire, even thou I am huge MCU nerd.I think the Norton-cut would have been better from film-making standpoint but idea of shared universe could have been tainted if studio interference wasn't involved. So now we are left with a puddle for entertainment only.Not the worst MCU entry but certainly one the low tiers.",6,0,0,19 June 2020
Iron Man 3," Has Charming RDJ but overall could have been better
","Many call it the worst MCU movie, for me this isn't even the worst Iron Man movie.A great start, 'We create own own demons'. I love that the movie focuses on Stark's PTSD coming from Avengers. This is the Stark's character being motivated by fear and ultimately leading to Ultrons creation.Feige said he wants to do different things with the third film, so he brings Shane Black. The director does what he is good at, Tony & Rhodey buddy cop. But the movie has a lot of other things going on, there is also a whole storyline with a kid, the kid was good but all things mashed together wasn't a great end product.Biggest unpopular opinion, the twist was goood. Ben Kingsley was perfect for a fake mandarin and as a con artist, 'I am an Acctorr'. Seeing back that we are getting Shang-Chi with real mandarin and Marvel making a short clip owing up their mistake and saying real mandarin still exist was great damage control.The villain was played great but felt short like all other marvel villains. Motivations...Seeing Iron Man rescue people from the plane was a breath of fresh air. Nowadays very few superhero movies show heroes rescuing civilians from danger.",7,0,0,24 June 2020
Iron Man 2," Another Phase 1 meh
","One of MCU's lower tier movies. I guess they were still trying to find their footing.The great things about the first one still carries on, Tony Stark can't be a more perfect casting. The Senate sequence is a great piece of introduction but the movie goes downhill as we progress.The villain Whiplash isn't that great but Sam Rockwell shines is some scenes with his charisma. A great introduction to Black Widow but she is done much better in Winter Soldier.Jon Favreau lacked a lot compare to the first one, mostly because of rushed productions for Avengers( everything pays off). The climatic scenes are better than first one but still forgettable action-sequence.I liked the small world building parts of Caps shield prototype, Coulson going to New Mexico and Nick Fury's Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division.It felt cramped between both a sequel to Iron Man 1 ( consequences of past actions) and prequel to Avengers.",6,0,0,19 June 2020
Knives Out," Classic Who-dun-it with Rian-ised twist
","One of my favourites from 2019Rian Johnson makes a Who-done-it? With a twist of his own, let the audience feel like that everybody is the murderer.Many people complain that they saw the twist coming but I would argue, even I saw the last twist coming and I was right, well I actually thought everybody for a brief moment was the murderer so whomever came through that door, I would have said 'I saw it coming'Some clever writing is obviously involved and I am excited about the sequel with our Southern Bond and I hope studio gives Rian more time to come up with these kind of stories.The ensemble cast is magnificent, the location is a beauty and political wars going in the background makes the family for realistic as they argue a lot a lot.
The Quips were well by some cast members.The charisma of the presence of Evans and his sweeter stole the show for many.
Ana de Armas gave a loveable performance as the protagonist.Some nitpicks will be 'Lie Vomit', that other caretakers plots of hospital receipt-going alone to get murdered felt surreal and too much at same time to digest.Overall must watch for the inevitable twist, might see another time to look at the more details. 'Prop-knife vs real knife''A doughnut hole in the doughnut's hole'",9,1,7,14 June 2020
Insomnia," Christopher Nolan doesn't have any bad films
","This movie is regarded as the worst/forgotten Christopher Nolan film but it is as good as they say 'Christopher Nolan never made a bad film!'
A-list cast of Al Pacino & Robin Williams with great supporting cast of Hillary Swank & Martin Donovan. Al Pacino is Al Pacino, no amount of my words could increase the Legend he is. Robin Williams played well the 'charming-looking' killer.The best bits are the recurring themes of Justification of Crime(small or large). All villains has movitations & justification for their actions and they use that to reject 'justice'. Both protagonist-antagonist have done crime with justifications fleshed out through-out the film, their parallel leads to the great confrontational scenes.
Ellie Bur(Hillary) character at the end not falling for the same trap of bad-cop is poetic indeed.Fantastic cinematography of Alaska at the start and great bits of Alaska's tropes(time, refuge) were very well handled and shownChristopher Nolan is my favourite director and I love him because he is the only one in business to make films about 'weird-concepts' and give outstanding executions, his films are hella-original. This movie lacks those (least Nolany film) but these doesn't make this directive-trillers any less great.To tell a personal truth, for the first time in like 10 years I haven't slept the whole day-night, had Insomnia symptoms for a while and now this movie kicked it to full gear.One of the finest,well crafted Directive-trillers with great twists and turns sprinkled around.",8,0,0,14 June 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee's comedy+horror
","What makes this movie more gutting & funny at the same time is that this is a true story. The horror of those kind of acts actually happening and the laughing stock of how they fooled KKK.This movie is wonderful acted by Washington and Adam Driver. Topher Grace as David Duke was a scene stealer.Thank god Spike had a comedic/more entertaining vibe to the film, he did balanced the comedy and horror quite good. The satirical approach makes the film more accessible for the inner message to reach a boarder audience. I have no problems with minor changes to history for entertainment value.Spike didn't just let the story from a biased-political agenda, he had the Black Panther group. The confrontational scene between Patrice and Ron was well handled with great movitations shown by each character.The story is unique and exciting but I sadly saw the trailer so the excitement of discovering the movie died for me and I felt bored in the first half, as nothing new was happening. After this I decided to stop watching trailers for indie, oscar films.The end clips made me feel speechless and how to this day, the horrors exist and why we need more of these film.Compare to this years Da 5 Five Bloods, this is a more entertaining film but Da 5 Bloods has more artistic merit to it.",7,1,2,23 June 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best Made MCU Film
","The start of the Russo Era. This movie is highly ranked among MCU fans(mostly No.1), yes I do agree it is the best made MCU film, its just isn't my favourite.The action is spectacular, the hand to hand combat between Steve and Bucky was top notch choreography. They kept wide shots and less cuts, and in day light, we can clearly see all their moves. Action wise, this is the best in MCU but personally I don't weight action as much as I wait other factors.The story is also great, nazi-hyder still lying around in Shield was a great twist. Hyder never leaves Captain America. The Bucky twist also feels natural, brings a relationship element with the main villain. The flashbacks and past film does the job to set it up.Russo's got Natasha so right, she shined throughout the film, her action sequence were the most bad-ass female fight I have ever seen (right below Kill-Bill). She actually felt like a former deadly assassin of KGB, Scarlet Johansson played her well.Samuel L Jackson completely solds Nick Fury, his car sequence was great. His with his classic wits are spinkled all over the film. But his return from death was a let down. I hate when characters come back from death.
His lines 'Last Time I trusted someone, I lost an eye' , ' You need to keep both eyes open' were fantastic but sadly Captain Marvel happened.Addition of Sam Wilson was great, he brings the more organic feel to the film. His running gag of 'On your left' got better with Endgame. He isn't a perfect soldier but a good man, deserves the Captain America Mantle.Chris Evans sells as the patriot Steve Rogers, his characters arc progresses and we see him getting more further away from patriotism, doubting the government and agency (Shield/Hyder). ' This isn't freedom', and his speech at the end in Shield Headquarters was inspiring.I will never forget the lift scene, the comedy is more subtle and feels more mature. The movie could be called a political thriller. But this also has a very cliché ( most clichést thing in my book), saving brainwashed friend by reminding him of past greatness. The final action sequence was good but getting chips into ships to disarm them, felt cheap in relation to other great bits. Hyder killing all people just like any other villain would, isn't something new, the movie spent good quality time to connect the villain's tyreny to heros' in humane level but failed to connect why Hyder will go this big now. The movie's third act could have stayed more grounded just like the rest to the film.I highly respect the script and direction of the film, I just haven't seen it 50 times to love this film as much as I love the other once.",9,1,1,26 June 2020
Ant-Man," Twist of heist in the Superhero Genre
","The low-scale low-threat level movie has the smallest Avenger. I love it cuz it was different, and it has Luizzzz.Paul Rudd is just such a great actor to play this ANT-MAN, even people in the movie stammer to speak his name. Micheal Douglas as old Hank Pym is believable. Evangeline Lilly is good at what she is given, shines when she trains Scoot. And Luizzz is by far steals this movie.I love cuz it is superhero movie with the mix of a heist, the comedy lands and cracks me everytime I watch it. Scoot isn't our everyday superhero, he is complete fraud. He robs, steals.
I love his relationship with his daughter, the yound actress playing Cassie is so cute and Scoot doing his best to make her happy sparks little emotion inside me.The villain could have been better. Story is great with Hank mastermining the plan and giving Scoot the mantle. Nice backstory for Hank to later revisit. Hanks distrust of Shield with some Stark reference which are cool as i am a MCU nerd.Luizzz is ma man, his dialogue delivery and him saying unnecessary gossip hits me hard with giggles. Everytime his sequence comes, I try to mimic him but fail miserable.",9,0,0,28 June 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," The best origin story that gets better everything I watch it.
","Steve Rogers, not a perfect soldier but a good man.The start is magnificent, I applaud Kevin Feige for making this movie set in 1940s. Skinny Steve does look a bit CGI now but it gets the job done. His inadequaty as a soldier was perfectly shown and him jumping on the granade was shown for him to be a good man.Steve & Bucky's relation was well planted for future. Steve & Peggy is one of my favourite ships of MCU, this movie has one of the most heartbreaking ending 'I had a date'. It gets better with Endgame.Captain America being shown as a propaganda figure, as a reference to comics, had some great laughs. And this inturn making him to step up to rescue other soldiers was a great storyline. But after that the story feels flat. Mostly because they skipped through a lot of war actions using montages. And the actions they included at aircraft & train weren't that good.Red Skull is just another big villain, they could have had some more character moments with him. Explains why Hugo didn't come back.
Dominic Copper nails the charming Howard Stark. Hayley Atwell is magnificent and she crushed the badass vibes of Peggy, loved her even in her own show.This movie connects well with Avengers and
Steve, the man out of time, just starting his great MCU journey. Love how the great character arc of Patriotism ends.",7,0,0,23 June 2020
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," More than just a sex comedy
","The cast is so great- Steve Carrel, Paul Rudd & Seth Rogen in the most Seth Rogen movie.Comedy is smart, the wax scene is iconic, its shocking to hear that it was actually done to get real life reactions from the cast. It is not a CGI but real hair were used ;)They find great situational comedy in the mix, the sex-ed class was great, the questions actualy feels like a kid or 40-year old virgin would ask.The morning wood scene was so pure that I don't know why I haven't seen many movies with that. The supporting characters feel like actual friends. The movie has some small messages with Steve Carrel being himself with his toys and others trying to change him for social norms.The ending is cliche but the movie had a smile on my face through out the run time.",8,0,0,28 June 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," James Gunn is the greatest addition to MCU
","James Gunn changed MCU.Feige's biggest gamble paid off. How this C-List comic superhero group became one of fans favourites is all due to James Gunn and his comedy.Pre-Gotg MCU had comedy but after this movie's success MCU went full comedy. We wouldn't have gotten rebooted comedy Thor if it wasn't for this movie.This has the classic group with misfits. The casting is great, Sarah Hanley Finn is the greatest. This movie launched Chris Pratt higher to the stars in Hollywood. Batista left wrestling and his Drax is a favourite of mine, the unique flavour of humour he brings to the table. Gamora has great backstory and her set was good as Russos fully explored her to greatness, this is why I love MCU, different directors from different movie working together for betterment of whole story.
It was great decision to cast already A-list stars as voice over, Bradley brings everything great about Rocket.The comedy lands perfectly for me. Each character has a bit different style of humour for all people to enjoy at least one. Personally I love Rockets wits but Drax's unintelligence gets the biggest laugh out of me, the numerous times I quoted ' Nothing can go over my head, I will catch them'.Not only comedy, the story is also great with Thanos being build in the back while Gamora and Nebula has their toxic relationship, heart felt Mother-Son breakup with inspiring scenes of 'Take my hand', Rocket lossing Groot with his final line being 'We are Groot', this is such a wholesome movie with the right emotion and comedy.The villain might come as weak but his seriousness makes the scene of 'Dance-Off' much better. James Gunn went full comedy and has a lot of fun with cosmic concepts.",10,0,0,27 June 2020
Shrek 2," The best Shrek Movie
","It is fun entertaining comedy for children and adults to laugh at the great references and adult humor. The intro was superb, Lord of the Rings, Spider-Man.All great voice actors returns with Puss in Boots, his iconic cute eyes will never be forgotten from my brain. Shrek-Donkey duo was less at first but we had great bits of them in 2nd half.Thank you for focusing on the relation of Shrek-Fiona and carrying the story forward with great their mix of parents. The villains were better in this film and a great twist of Charming taking over Shrek's place. Price Charming is as charming as he can get. The father had a nice arc with a great backstory,frog, which ties everything nicely.The ending action sequence is better in this film, for that giant gingerbread. Some great humor of course with Eddie Murphy's donkey, the pinocchio thong had me rolling.The movie again tackles beauty issues and it was well presented, it didn't felt they were pasting from first film but was actually showing natural progression of characters.One of the best sequels ever made, carries what made past film great and increase them for more greatness.",10,0,0,24 June 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The worst avengers movie but far from even a bad action film.
","Stark motivated by fear creates Ultron. The last living Hydra (until now) creates Wanda & Pietro using Loki's scepter. Nice follow up to previous storylines of solo filmsThe after party scene with Mjolnir is one of my favourites. This is the reason why I love MCU, the dialogues between the action sequence, character inactions, whips, callbacks. Watch NandovMovies video on this after party sequence.The twins are great, Wanda is flawed with bad past (even more now) and Pietro's dead in my opinion was worth it, at last someone died for real. In real life people die without notice, not all people have a chance to fullfil everything. Its was great for Wanda's motivation moving forward.
And Clint naming his son, Natalian Pietro Barton was nice. If you have seen Endgame, Clint's Son name is cursed.Captain America and Iron Man's fude continues, 'Everytime someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die'. The bitterness was better in Avengers 1 but still Avengers 2 has some great lines, 'A suit of armour everywhere' , 'We would lose -- Then we would do that together too' and seeing this lines pop up again in Endgame was fantastic.Thor has a side journey which I am not a fan, the slow discovery of infinity stones is great in the long run but it doesn't add anything to this movie in particular. Comparatively Wakanda's setup was better, as Ultron was also in the mix.Black Widow and Banner has romantic interaction which I liked at first but now it feels forced as they didn't continue with it.Ultron is just is another one of MCU's bad motivated villains, if they fleshed out the movitations more instead of weak subplots of Thor and Widow then it would have been better. James Spader voice is great, sometimes too comici. And sometimes thinking about how Ultron spends 5 minutes in the internet to decide to kill off humanity completely gets me cracking, it was good motivation but not fleshed out enough.Nick Fury adds more humor to the mix and Burton's family makes this movies more humanly relatable-- They are litteral Gods, and I have a bow & arrow.The ending is epic as a Avengers 3rd act should be, but Joss Wedons Avengers 1 was more well crafted. Hulkbuster Sequence was great sequence of entertainment. Movie could have much better, Loki was set up early, Thanos for 6 years but Ultron's set up & pay off was in the same film.",7,1,1,28 June 2020
3 Idiots," My Favourite Movie
","Which movie should be the first for me to write a review for,the movie that I watched 150+ times?Yes I clearly watched it 150+ times and can still watch 100 times more.Every time this movie airs on Sony TV or Sony Max I watch it with my family.The comedy is the best I have seen and mixed with emotions and thought provoking ideas makes this THE FAVOURITE MOVIE for me.
I still watch it and discover more and more about it,the dialogues(hidden meaning behind early dialogues).I am not native indian speaker and I watched it as I grew up so many adult jokes started came to my understanding after many years.The transitions from comedy to emotion is beautiful handled by Rajkumar Hirani.Aamir Khan is perfect.Mandy and Joshi are the Best best friends of any movie.
Many thought provoking lines from the movie still follows me to this day.
I watch it and laugh just like I am watching it for the first time",10,0,0,12 October 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," James Gunn strikes back
","This has to be my most underrated MCU film, people rate it much low but for me it cracks top tier.Yes it drags but I love those portions as it settles the characters much more, much more dialogues and character moments. It also doesn't throw the villain at your face but builds relationships.Baby Groot is cute, Rocket does everything we loved about that character from first one. Rocket-Groot bomb sequence is one of my favourite sequence this movie is filled with many other comedy gold.Drax comedy is still my favourite, Peter having sexual emotion for Gamora and Drax screaming top of his lungs cracked me the most. Drax and Mentis just starting their weird relation.Gamora & Nebula's bonding thickens with fantastic toxic sister-sister relationships were explored. Peters relationship with his Father, being set up as a alien in first movie got good continuity and explains a lot more about Peter getting kidnapped by Ravengers. Peter at last playing ball with his father. Peter taking quick reaction of shooting his father just as he hear about tumor, Peter can't control his emotion.Yondu is the best daddy, his arc and redemption felt so emotional with original Ravengers returning to celebrate that beautiful funeral, heads off to the CGI department. The whistle sequence was such so great.Tonne of great laughs with sublet themes of family and relationships.",10,0,0,30 June 2020
Thor," Shakespeare meets Thor
","Feige tried something new, got Kenneth Branagh do a Shakespearian superhero film.Thank god they casted nobodies like Hemsworth and Hiddleston, now these 2 has cemented their roles as Thor and Loki. Anthony Hopkins gave a good performance as Odin. Natalie Portman is a great actress but she lacked something.The movie does a magnificent job of world building, establishes Asgard and gave good expositions linking real life Norse Mythology and explains it through science and not only just magic. Asgard's set pieces were grand and felt real.Thor getting unworthy and going to earth for a fish-out-of-water story is a great storyline.
I really felt bad at the middle when Thor couldn't pick up the hammer.Looking back Tom Hiddleston as Loki is phenomenal. His acting of slowly working, in the back, for jealousy and planning to trap Thor to get unworthy is so great.The Shakespearian elements were great but it cuts short for Earth's story, which is also great but both mashed together didn't feel so right. Execution could have been bettetThis movie gives Thor a great character arc for worthyness but for me it felt cliche as we all knew it was ganna happen and Thor going up to the steel guy to protect his friends felt underwhelming for some reasons. The final battle of Thor and Loki was good at first watch but Loki sacrificing just for future tricks didn't work after multiple viewings.Some of the earth's character were annoying. I did like slowly building Shield in the background.The movie does a great job to set up Loki for future but inturn decrease this movies worth.",7,0,0,21 June 2020
The Terminal," The most underrated film I have ever seen
","I was very disappointed seeing how low rated this movie was compare to other highly rated Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg movies.I totally buyed Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski. His performance as the helpless traveller and not understanding english really hit me emotionally. His accent and acting is one of the best with Forest Gump.The originality and concept is fantastic. Cinematography, while being confined in an airport tried everything it had to offer. All the side characters gave a believable performance. It felt like watching a family living in the airport. Stanley Tucci was great as the antagonist.Well the love story felt frictional and could have been executed better, the ending of Viktor only coming to New York for a signature felt more of Feel Good movie trope.",9,1,1,18 June 2020
Shrek," Revisiting by childhood after 10 years
","I loved Shrek as a child, watched them multiple times. Now that Shrek got soaring support from the internet with memes. I checked it out again with my younger brothers.I thought this movie was ganna be huge, but it truly packes a tonne of things in 1.5 hr runtime. It feels long in a good way. This time I understand a lot of the reference to pop-culture fairy tales. Some adult humor went over my head as a child but now I got them.As english being my 2nd language I didn't get a lot of Donkeys jokes but this time Eddie Murphy was fantastic. Some jokes like 'dragon kissing Shrek's ass' were not funny but my brothers were laughing a lot. This movie is for everybody and anyone can enjoy at least some parts of it.Even underneath it was about that anyone can look beautiful. And some great meta jokes about fairy tales.Now ganna watch Shrek 2, even baby me knew the 2nd one was better.",8,1,1,23 June 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Worst MCU movie but has one of world's best scores
","Patty Jankins(WW director) left the movie for good. The script is really bad. Even at the end Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely couldn't save it. (MM wrote Cap 123 & Avengers 34)For me, Chris Hemsworth's Thor was still unlikeable, just bland cosmic stuffs, Thor is OP and the first movie took his worthiness away for great storytelling but this movie didn't do anything for me to relate to the main character.Loki is a movie saver, he shines in some scenes, changing to Cap, tricking to cut thor's hand, and him in jail in a helpless state was great. His reaction to his mother's death was golden.Jane and the annoying bunch returns and it's bad comedy, only 'meow meow' made me laugh. Natalie and Chris has no chemistry and audience didn't even care to notice that the last kiss wasn't actually even Natalie, but Chris's Wife.A lot has been said about Malakate ( I don't care to spell him correctly) but the actor even said filming was tough because we all know his character is the worst villain ever. This happens when in every movie our hero faces a world ending villain with a silly and unexplored motivation. The final fight was fine, some clever elements of cross world telapotation was available.The aether/reality stone was tied well but there also exist the retcon of solid gem & liquid aether.Positive things, Thor's mother's death was good but they could have gotten more emotions out of me if we had more of her. Endgame did a good job and looking back it now has more emotional punch. The main reasons why I like her death is because it has one of the best soundtrack, 'Into Eternity' it was so good that Taika returned it in Ragnarok.The main theme song is legendary, Bryan Tyler does a phenomenal work. I listen to both the soundtracks time to time.If you are looking for entertainment, it has it. But nothing more to offer than a Blockbuster.",5,0,0,24 June 2020
Da 5 Bloods," Spike Lee's War~Politico~Gold Hunt
","Vietnam war vets with PTSD plus post-war search for gold mashed with high level of politics.We have seen war movies. We have seen soldiers looking for stuffs in war. This is the same with high themes & politics and comdey sprinkled around.Gorgeous cinematography of Vietnam, the greenary was bursting out of my screen. The cast gets the job done but after hearing Spike Lee tried to get Samuel L Jackson, Washington Sr. & Jr. and Giancarlo Esposito, the movie could have uped its value much more for me. Delroy Lindo has already gotten oscar nom.Yes the movie is a bit slow and drags in some cases but it works to set up the characters and flesh out their past. Due to it being slow it actually feels like I am there with da Bloods, going to bar, seeing new & improved Vietman. But this flow becomes inconsistent, for example when the first mine-boom bursted, everything started to rush and we were hit with multiple incidents and they happen very quickly. If the movie slowed down in those areas our emotions for those characters could have stayed much longer.But man was it thrilling, that 1 2 3 scene was griping as hell. Well crafted. Speaking about crafting, the use of screen ratio for storytelling was a great idea.Now politics. I love that Spike didn't tell an one sided story, even had dialogues multiple times of how Americans themsleves talk about their one-sided history. It didn't shy away from showing Vietnam's people anger & post-war situation.
Money/Gold destroys people, greed broke this group. Paul wasn't just some Maga hat wearing 1 note villain, his movitations, his guilt, anger, flaws were magnificently explored and explained. Why he choose this side and hated his son, hated site of Vietnamese were boldly explored.
Him getting mercy from Norm in his own mind was beautiful character moment.
Spike didn't shy away from gore & violence (I actually heard there was ganna be high blood-shed from critics and truth is, I was a bit disappointed for less amount of blood)The movie taging everything with Black History - slavery, civil rights & BLM were connected perfectly and the theme of Black People, still getting oppressed, hits you hard multiple times. I know people with other agendas will have other things to say but I keep my agendas away from ART.I was disappointed with the cast not getting de-aged for war scenes but at the end when they showed an old picture with de-aged characters it just shows the war scenes played in their head with Norm still being young and fit, and them being themselves.Norm & Paul are Martin & Malcom and their views in opposite spectram where challenged and social commentary was explored perfectly.Some small nitpicks, most comedy didn't land for me and it dragged a few times, didn't care about some characters. But I respect the hell out of Spike for making this film.",8,5,7,22 June 2020
The Social Network," An editing and dialogue masterpiece
","Mark Zuckerberg, the lizard alien gets his own movie with a person playing him in the most opposite way as possible.David Finher is well known for his detailed adaptation skills for Zodiac but this movie is different but it highly pays off. Mark's starting girlfriend is frictional but it serves the ending of him sending her friend-requestJesse Eisenberg plays the role phenomenally and his presence will stick with me forever. The witty, quick fast high IQ dialogues with masterfully crafted edites make this movie hell of fun to watch. On top it is a very entertaining film, with tremendous acting skills shown by both Jesse and Andrew Garfield.The movie focuses on two different legal battle taking place in different times but the movie shifts back and forth without losing a single bit. Also telling the origin story of Facebook.This movie is adapted from Andrews real life person's written book so we feel emotional for him a lot.I love how they didn't waste time to explain (exposition scenes) of programming and straight up talked in their coding-language to make us feel watching actual nerds figure it out.Dialogues of changing the world, creating the next big thing instead of going to parties are inspiring in my eyes.",9,0,1,20 June 2020
