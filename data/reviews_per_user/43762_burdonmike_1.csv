Skyfall," poor
",Never been a big Bond fan. However Daniel Craig best Bond by far. Liked Casino Royale and despite my minority view preferred QoS as a film. Agree with many on Skyfall that plot is very poor. Silly in fact. The scene at the end when they try and fashion weapons is like a cross between the A Team and Home Alone. It seems to be that the film steals several ideas from other films but fails to deliver as a whole. The helicopter scene at end reminds me of Lethal Weapon 2- but its done better in that film. Why would a top agent drive to Scotland with no weapons or back up with head of MI6 ?And the most ridiculous thing was the Bond girl. He knows she is a sex slave- wants to be freed from all this- so just appears naked in shower later on to take advantage of her vulnerability. Then she gets killed quickly.Daft.,4,10,21,13 November 2012
