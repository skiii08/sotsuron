Your Name.," A beautiful movie
","It's very suitable for watching on the big screen of the cinema. It's a great experience of watching the movie. The picture is very delicate. The author is a very powerful person. The picture is very beautiful. It's just that the plot feels a bit old-fashioned, which doesn't surprise me. It's the most feeling when I watch it in the cinema. The picture plus background music is still very enjoyable.",8,0,0,1 April 2020
3 Idiots," Great movie
","It's a very good movie. I've seen it several times. I have different feelings at different ages. Now I see that the protagonist is very clear about what he wants to do from small to large. The goal of life is very clear. I like the performance of Amir Khan very much. He plays so well. One of my favorite clips is:
Do you know who we are?
Invigilator: I don't know.
Do you know our name and test number?
Invigilator: I don't know.
Since he doesn't know -- run!",9,0,0,20 March 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of things ,and no good thing ever dies.
","Habit is really a terrible thing. Brooke spent too long in Shawshank. When he was released, he could not adapt to the outside world or even fear the outside world. Finally, he had to end his life in his house alone. But Andy is different, He has hope. Although there is little hope in Shawshank prison, Andy did it. He used a small hammer to chisel away the wall that blocked his way to the outside world bit by bit with the hope in his heart. And he insisted for such a long time. I believe no one can do it for such a long time, but he did it. The world is full of hope and possibility Let's not give up hope.",9,0,0,17 March 2020
Music and Lyrics," way back into love
","The music is very good. Every song is like a person. A piece of music is a person's appearance. A good appearance can attract you to understand it. The lyrics are a person's interior. If you are attracted by its interior, then you will fall in love with the song",7,0,0,5 April 2020
Slumdog Millionaire," Great movie
","This film shows the miserable situation of the poor areas in India. Although the protagonist answers every question correctly, there is a very sad memory behind every answer. Because of the huge gap between the rich and the poor areas, the cognition they receive is totally different. The protagonist works hard to live and forge ahead with hope. The road ahead is still full of difficulties Ji, he answered every question correctly, but was suspected to be cheating, just because he was from the slum, which is really ironic.",9,0,0,30 March 2020
