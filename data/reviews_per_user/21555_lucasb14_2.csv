The King's Speech," amazing
",i think that this film is truly inspiring and just amazing. i really didn't think that i would be into a film like this but it is just amazing it is a definite recommend to everyone of my friends. i think personally that the actors in this did very very good and that they definitely chose the right people to act in this film. it is truly a masterclass of a film everyone should see it no matter what rent it or buy it it is just a win with whatever you do. Colin firth definitely was the best actor to play Bertie in this film he just does it perfectly. everyone go buy it just do it and you won't regret buying it at all and will absolutely love it.,9,0,0,15 May 2011
X-Men: First Class," fantastic
","This film has all the things that a film should have. Good action scenes and good fighting. The effects that they used in this film are amazing especially with the wings and many more. If i am honest i didn't really expect a a lot from this movie because of the different cast but it was truly amazing and just fantastic. There is probably one face in there that you will recognize at one point in the movie i really didn't think it was who it was but it was. This film is definitely a ten out of ten what i thought made it really really good was the different types of mutants in it and also the younger mutants and how some parts out of x-men 1,2 and 3 is finally out and shows you how it happens and that and it is just truly amazing.",10,2,5,1 June 2011
