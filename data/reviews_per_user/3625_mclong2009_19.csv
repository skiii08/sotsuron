Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful movie
","'Blade Runner 2049' was an exceptional movie-going experience. The film is 3 hours long, but it pulls you into it futuristic world and you become immersed in the story and it's beautiful, haunting landscapes. The movie is slow. But seeing the director's last movie masterpiece, 'Arrival', I knew to expect that. Seeing the 3 short films featured on YouTube was fun as well. As a fan of the first Blade Runner movie, I liked the way this movie cleverly keeps Deckard's true identity a mystery. All the cast members do a fine job, though it would have been fun to see the director's original choice to play Wallace, David Bowie, in that role. I saw the movie in it's regular format, and because of it's length it is not a movie I would run out the next night and see again. But I hope to see it next time in an IMAX theater. I owned the original 'Blade Runner' soundtrack featuring Vangelis, and though I won't be downloading it this soundtrack is equally as haunting and atmospheric.",9,1,9,9 October 2017
John Wick," Exciting movie
","I finally got around to seeing 'John Wick', folks say you should see the this one before seeing the 2nd. The movie is exciting enough, the soundtrack is loud and seems to ebb and flow with the level Mr. Wick's killing carnage. Mr. Reeves is certainly looking good for age 52, and is impressive as he jumps around wrestling and killing folks. I will never 'get' the concept of someone going off to war because someone kills his dog and steals his car, but you certainly don't have to understand that to enjoy the movie. I'm not sure how many of these John Wick movies they can keep making without giving the character a little more emotional resonance. The way it looks now, 'John Wick' is some kind of natural step between humans making and directing movies and artificial intelligence taking over the movie making.",7,1,2,24 February 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," OK Movie
","Although it carries the magic of the Star Wars name, 'Rogue One' is just another big, rather soulless Hollywood drama. I can't say I didn't get my ten dollars worth but there are episodes of 'The Vikings' I'd rather watch. I actually enjoyed the 'The Force Awakens' a lot more than I enjoyed this one. I felt the chemistry and tension between Jin and Cassian worked pretty well, although the reprogrammed droid was probably the most interesting character. Darth Vader's appearances are pointless and uninspired. 'Rogue One' is an interesting chapter in the Star Wars saga, but the battle scenes do go on a bit. Forest Whitaker's character was certainly an incomplete and puzzling one--I suppose most moviegoers were familiar with his character going in. Here's hoping episode 8 lives up to the hype",7,2,6,4 January 2017
Moana," Still playing to full theaters
","I saw 'Moana' tonight in the local movie theater. I have been wanting to see it since Thanksgiving and expected the audience to be few. To my amazement the cinema was almost full, and I can see why. 'Moana' is a fabulous movie--it will certainly leave you crying and smiling. I would imagine most of the folks in the audience now have seen it 3 or 4 times. I served a number of years in the Army in Hawaii, so I was attracted to the movie for that reason, and it was certainly a great movie going experience. The animated graphics capture the magic and beauty of Polynesia, the land and the ocean. And the story is a lot of fun. Highly recommended for all ages.",9,41,77,4 February 2017
Suicide Squad," Somewhere between 'Ghostbusters' and 'Avengers'
","'Suicide Squad' is another mildly entertaining film--I wasn't expecting much after I'd heard it was trying to be like 'Deadpool'. I haven't seen 'Deadpool' yet but one film trying to be like another is never a really a healthy sign. The pacing is so similar to 'Ghostbusters', and at some scenes the members of 'Suicide Squad' come together like they are the next 'Avengers', but the characters just don't have the chops for it. Will Smith's character can shoot straight, cool. Another is hot and crazy--Harley Quinn. The other is an over the top psycho--The Joker. Throw in some real life Navy seals, great CGI and some otherworldly witches, and it all adds up to a watchable film. I really enjoyed Mr. Ayers' 'The Fury'. I suppose the DC universe puts expectations on to a writer\director. You can be good, just don't be great.",6,0,1,27 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Excellent escapist entertainment
","'Doctor Strange' is quite a wild ride of whirling color and psychedelia, and borrows heavily from 'Inception'. I enjoyed the character of Dr. Strange--his coming to terms with his disability and the overall processes and challenges of opening his mind to it's endless possibilities. 'The Ancient One' is quite a character as well, maybe in a future movie her challenges with the dark forces could be examined more. As a big 'Hannibal' fan it was fun seeing Mads Mikkelson in his role as the rogue student. The other supporting characters are interesting as well. I enjoyed the different locales, especially the mind-blowing final scenes with Strange battling the dark forces. The first 'Avengers' movie remains my favorite Marvel movie but this one is a close second.",8,3,6,9 November 2016
Man of Steel," Great movie
","I thought Man of Steel was a great movie, from beginning to end. The acting was first-rate, especially the actor who portrayed General Zod--he stole some scenes from Russell Crowe playing Superman's real Dad, and that's not easy to do. But all the actors did real well and the military was well represented and believable. I had to chuckle a little when Superman reveals he has been on earth '33 years' and the image of Christ is behind him in the scene from the church. But that's cool. Director Zach Snyder does a great job with this movie and the special effects, spaceships, and fight scenes are incredible. I am glad I bought this movie in Blu-ray.",10,3,5,10 August 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Welcome Back, Wizards
","As a Harry Potter fan, it is hard to judge 'Fantastic Beasts' without comparison to the Potter films. Fantastic Beasts has its own magic and charm, but gone are the supporting characters--Dumbledore, Snape, the Dark Lord, etc, which made the Potter stories so good. I can't see any of the characters introduced in 'Beasts' as stepping into those roles. Colin Farrell does well as the dark magic heavy; Eddie Redmayne is great as Newt, the Zookeeper. As usual these days in Hollywood the special effects carry the day and make what was an OK movie into a very watchable one. They say this story arc has five more movies and I would imagine they'll take the story right up to the birth of Mr Potter. Should be fun!",7,0,2,11 January 2017
Avengers: Endgame," I like Infinity Wars a lot better
","It's hard to criticize Endgame, given its enormous success. It certainly had its moments, the scene with Hawkeye and Nat was incredible, and the closing scene was really cool, it really made the viewer feel like he was part of the Marvel pantheon. But I wouldn't be in any hurry to see it again, and I watched Endgame 4 or 5 times. I've heard the latest Spider-Man gets the Marvel universe revved up again, so that will be fun.",7,2,4,18 August 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," An Entertaining Romp
","The latest 'Pirates of the Caribbean' is another entertaining romp across the high seas, never stopping to make much sense but that's OK. The first half of the movie finds Captain Jack drinking and half-drunk all the time, which is kind of a shame. I guess the film makers were trying to emphasize how down and out he'd become. But some fresh faces inject some new life in the series, and the same thrilling chase scenes and impossible rescues are still in abundance. The English soldiers still can't shoot any better than storm troopers. It's escapist entertainment at it's best, which is all it is trying to be. I wouldn't be surprised though if they tried to make the next one without Captain Jack Sparrow.",8,0,1,17 November 2017
Silence," Certainly a long movie, but worth it
","'Silence' with its largely unanswered questions of faith and and God and religion, it certainly a long movie, but worth seeing. The acting is incredible throughout--the English and Japanese actors both doing a superb job. The story of Portuguese priests in Japan in the 1600s was interesting for me, because I could see both sides. What value did this new religion bring to the ruling class of Japan? They were a culture who followed the beauty and power of nature, and some scenes in the movie, a stunning view of the moon for instance, highlighted this. The movie gets a little slow sometimes but some of the final scenes with Mr. Neeson and Mr. Garfield are some of the most moving and powerful I've ever witnessed. Anyone interested in this movie would do well to read James Clavell's 'Shogun', another engrossing novel set in Japan and encompassing the same time period.",9,5,11,24 January 2017
Logan," Great movie, uncomfortably real
","Hats off to director and screenwriter James Mangold for putting a real- life, gritty spin on the Marvel Universe. The film is about as real as you could ever expect a comic-book movie to be. Anyone who has seen an elder suffer from the effects of dementia can appreciate Mr. Stewart's performance and the interaction between he and Wolverine. And the young actress who plays Laura is incredible, her character's edge makes the movie tick. I just hope we don't read about her 20 years from now, her life spiraling downhill. I can't see how a young person can't be hugely affected by these roles. As one who spent time in El Paso in the Army, I can say that having the movie backdrop in this area of the country (as well as Juarez) really added to its gritty, edgy quality. Congratulations to Hugh Jackman as well for a superb run as The Wolverine.",9,2,6,15 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Very entertaining movie
","I'd never seen a Guillermo Del Toro movie before, but I'd heard of his movies and I was expecting an odd, fantastical film. 'The Shape of Water' doesn't disappoint on that score, but I enjoyed the movie. The amphibious creature is very impressive. The movie makes you believe that the woman could fall for him. Octavia keeps it all real with her performance and earthy, snappy lines of dialogue. Michael Shannon gives his usual fine performance as the creature's cruel captor and keeper. His character is certainly 'over the top' with his manner and cruelty. The sets are very impressive--the viewer is immersed in 1962 paranoid, cold war America. And of course the female lead actress deserves an Oscar for her portrayal of the mute janitor. She portrays so much emotion--love, desperation, kindness, anger--without a word. I will never be sure what motivates someone to write and direct such a story but congratulations to Mr. Del Toro!",8,39,73,19 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Great Popcorn flick
","'Kong; Skull Island' was a very entertaining popcorn movie; it kept my interest throughout, and never really slowed down much. I thought it was a good idea to place it in the time frame of the 1970's. Kong the ape was front and center and King Kong really was a king this time. The story was a good one--in another movie John C. Reilly's Robinson Curuso-type character would have stolen the show. But in this one each of the actors share screen time almost equally. The sound track features snippets of some of the best rock music ever recorded, and I liked the references to 'Heart of Darkness' and the influences of Francis Ford Coppolla's 'Apocalypse Now'.",8,1,2,23 March 2017
Arrival," Incredible movie experience
","'Arrival' is an incredible movie experience, featuring the super-smart, super-sensitive Louise as the linguist who gets to meet and 'get to know' the aliens who have mysteriously arrived on earth. Yes the movie moves and unfolds very slowly, but it has to to make you feel the weird, stark-eyed fascinated uneasiness of the characters as they come face to face with these beings. I am not even sure there is a word or words that describes what that must feel like, but the movie makes you feel it anyway. Everything else in between is well done as well, the dream sequences with Louise and her child, the tension between her and the government types, the fascination and eureka moments as she begins to unlock their language and their reason for being here. Hats off to the director and to Amy Adams for an incredible performance.",10,1,6,10 March 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dark and takes it time building
","I really enjoyed 'Man of Steel', I thought that movie sizzled right from the start, and the scene where General Zod and his army first come to Earth and announce 'You are not alone' is one of the creepiest I've ever seen. By contrast 'Dawn of Justice' is one of the darkest, slow burning movies of this genre imaginable. As a casual movie fan, who only goes to the box office to see big budget, usually super-hero\action movies like this, it just amazed me how long it took to get going. The pacing certainly tests one's patience, but throughout the movie there are some great scenes. I am just glad I watched it at home on Blu-Ray, so I could pause and walk away for a while. I don't think there is any way I could have taken this movie in in one sitting.",8,2,3,30 August 2016
John Wick: Chapter 2," Can't Wait to See Chapter 3
","John Wick is back for more revenge carnage in Chapter 2; no sooner then he finds and firestorms the garage\warehouse\den of thieves holding his prized automobile, another villain and another war breaks out. We find out more about the strange kill or be killed world he (reluctantly) inhabits. This time his dog lives, but about 110-120 bad guys don't. Gun enthusiasts enjoy the skillful way Mr.Reeves handles his gun hardware, and the realistic way his character is forced to change magazines frequently. It was cool to see Mr. Fishburne and Mr.Reeves back together again. I am thinking we'll see more of his character in Chapter 3. I will be looking forward to seeing the final installment of this very exciting movie trilogy.",Null,1,3,7 March 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Great World War 2 movie
","'Hacksaw Ridge' is an extremely realistic and well-made World War 2 movie. Mr. Garfield sparkles as Desmond Doss, with the real-life's characters sweet earnestness and simple, religious convictions. The rest of the cast does well, too. Vince Vaughn is a convincingly tough Army sergeant. The battle field scenes are horrific and brutal. It is incredible that our fathers and grandfathers went through such horrors. Mr. Gibson brings it all back with a great directing touch and outstanding cinematography. As an Army veteran, I wanted to see the movie. I have enjoyed all of Mel Gibson's movies, though I would never want to see 'Passion of the Christ' again. Now that he is back, I am hoping Mel continues to direct more outstanding movies like 'Hacksaw Ridge'.",9,4,8,23 November 2016
Warcraft," Entertaining movie
","'Warcraft' is an entertaining movie. With orcs and humans, magic and swords, it is tempting to try and compare it with 'Lord of the Rings'--but since those movies were based on a treasured novel and 'Warcraft' inspired by a video game, Warcraft's goals aren't quite as lofty. But it is a fun film. It was cool seeing King Ragnar from the 'Vikings' in the lead role. And the scenes with the orcs are really amazing. It is pretty clear that the end of was setting up a sequel, so I will look forward to that. And at the end I even had an excuse to dust off some old David Bowie albums. Congratulations to his son, Duncan, for directing a fine movie.",7,0,0,7 October 2016
