The Blair Witch Project," One of the top 10 films of the 90s
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a suprisingly realistic, 'disturbingly' scary movie about three filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams) creating a documentary on the legendary Blair Witch, venture into the woods, get lost, and strange things start happening.  Although it's not as scary as some of the greats, like 'The Exorcist', it is definitely the 'Jaws' of the woods.  Heather's confession to the camera is VERY 'heart-tugging'.  The ending is also one of the most shockingly scary endings EVER (I said out loud 'Oh My God!' when it got on screen). TBWP features FANTASTIC acting for amatuers, effective camera work, and is an entertaining film, as well as a great film to watch to show how to build tension and mood.",Null,2,5,23 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fine film
","Being that I'm not a big Star Wars fan at all, I went into this movie like any other (except for the fact that I was going to a movie that was being hyped the Second Coming) and admit, it was cool seeing the crawling screen for the first time on the big screen, as well as seeing the light-saber fight.  I'm going to keep it short and sweet, since everything about this movie has been said in the 1670 or so messages behind me.  Here we go:Special Effects: A+ (some of the best I've EVER seen) Story: C (again I'm not big on SW) Characters: C (many were boring or wooden, in my opinion) Overall: B (worth the price of admission)",Null,0,0,23 August 1999
Barry Lyndon," Beautiful, underrated film
","Stanley Kubrick has crafted another masterpiece.  Barry Lyndon features beautiful music, costumes, lighting, etc.  The acting is also VERY well done.  Barry Lyndon is the story about a young man's (Ryan O' Neal) rise and fall in high society.  As mentioned, it's a beautiful, well-made story.  BL clocks in at about 3 hours, so, as with several of Kubrick's films, people should be made aware of the pacing before seeing it.  See Barry Lyndon, and be awe-struck.",Null,1,2,22 August 1999
The Shining," VERY scary movie
","'The Shining' is an impressive horror film from Stanley Kubrick. The story is about Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson, in top form), his wife Wendy (Shelly Duvall), and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd) going up to the Overlook Hotel for the winter.  However, Danny starts seeing things about the Overlook that present it as an evil place, while Jack is losing his mind from writer's block, and the evil forces in the hotel.  As with every Stanley Kubrick film, it's thought-provoking (esp. the ending!).  The scariest scenes in the film are:*(Minor Spoilers)*
The twins at the end of the hall ('Come and play with us Danny...Forever...and ever...and ever), The woman in the bathtub, Danny's possession by 'Tony'The music is also haunting, and stays with you for a LONG time, as with many of Kubrick's films.  While Shelly Duvall gets annoying at times, it's (in a way) necessary)  Ranks up with the scariest movies of all time (Exorcist, Pet Sematary 1).  See 'The Shining' ASAP.",Null,0,0,22 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The best movie of 1998
","Only Steven Spielberg could paint such a horrific vision of war. The opening 15 minutes has to be one the best 15 minutes ever dedicated to film.  It's shocking, moving, and disturbing all at the same time.  Great performances all around, especially to Hanks.  Unfortunately, SPR didn't win Best Picture, or Best Actor at the Academy Awards, which it so rightfully deserved.  At least it got Best Director, Best Sound, Best Film Editing(?), etc.  Kudos to Spielberg, Kaminski, Hanks, etc.!",Null,0,0,24 May 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," The thinking man's science fiction movie
","Every detail about this movie is perfect.  The music, the special effects (1968?), the writing (or lack of, which is used to it's advantage with WONDERFUL visuals), everything. From the opening with the 'OVERTURE' to the ending with the 'Star Child', 2001 is a pure masterpiece from the first frame to the last frame.  It was this movie that set the way for Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.  See 2001 as soon as you can, and think about it for an hour or so afterwards.",Null,3,6,4 August 1999
A Clockwork Orange," One of Kubrick's many masterpieces
","A Clockwork Orange is definitely one of Kubrick's best films.  Like 2001, the classical music works perfectly with the film itself.  ACO is insightful, eerie, disturbing, and original.  All in all, a perfect film made the great genius Stanley Kubrick (R.I.P).",Null,0,0,24 May 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Overall great movie
","Time Magazine hit the nail right on the head with the words 'Stanley Kubrick's haunting, final masterpiece'. There is great acting, wonderful camera work, is mesmorizing, and thought-provoking (it will keep you thinking about it hours after it's over). Can't think of much else to say, except see the movie, and R.I.P. Stanley Kubrick.kubrick18",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
Jaws," One of the most influential films ever made
","'Jaws' is a landmark film.  It was one of the first big 'blockbusters', made Steven Spielberg (and the actors) a 'household' name, and STILL manages to keep thousands of people skeptical about going into the water. 'Jaws' is the story of three men: A Chief of Police (Roy Schneider), a fisherman (Robert Shaw), and an oceanographer (Richard Dreyfuss) going out to the sea to capture a great white shark terrorizing the small town of Amity. 'Jaws' is quite memorable and well-done:  the acting, direction, scenery, and camera work under water among others, but the music is one of the greatest, most memorable, recognizable, and frightening music used in a motion picture.  While the special effects of the actual shark are not the best, seeing the actual shark is not the reason most people have been kept out of the water.  It's the fear of NOT seeing the shark that scares most people. To those who haven't seen 'Jaws', see it, and be prepared to think twice about entering ANY kind of body of water.",Null,0,1,23 August 1999
The Matrix," Wow!!
","I don't think I've see a more complex (plot-wise) movie.  What CAN'T be said about this movie:Very good acting (esp. Keanu Reeves), Exceptional plot, Some of the best slow-motion, camera work, kung fu, action fighting, special effects, and gun play I've EVER seen!!!!My hat goes off to the Wachowski brothers.  One of the top 15 films made in the past decade.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
