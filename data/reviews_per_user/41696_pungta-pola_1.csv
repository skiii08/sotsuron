The Avengers," It is rated 8.6? Is it a joke!!! :O :O
","Are movies so bad now a days that a film like this is considered great? Whats wrong with everyone. Its like you have nothing new in cinema hall that you have to rate this movie 8.6. WTF !!! Made a ketchup with super heroes, heroes (not 'super'), Norse gods and WW2 heroes. Nothing made any sense in this movie. No story. Worst action. 'Total trash' i can call it... And this is called amazing... You are amazing who have no movie taste at all.It really made me angry when it mock the super hero characters like HULK. So Hulk can temp himself as his wish, when he wish !!! And this is called 'balanced everything masterfully' (as someone reviewed)... lol.It should be considered as a comedy. I could not stop laughing when i see that if someone is touched by Loki's weapon, his eyes would be blue & he would start working as Loki's man. And when he will be beat up by avengers, his eyes would be become normal and he would left Loki.... rofl. 8.6 for this trash !!! .... :o :o :o .... That's so pathetic.....This movie is not 'exceptional'. Did not you watched any super-hero movies before !!! Watch more movies; Google the 'Exceptional' word for know it's meaning: then use it.",5,4,10,26 August 2012
