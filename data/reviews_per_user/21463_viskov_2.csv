Hereditary," Rare use of jumpscares! Praise be!
","This is an admirable film! Finally not a cash grab who wants to scare you a couple times and give nothing else! It has drama and many artistic qualities which people can enjoy! The camerawork the best part for me! The family drama is great and the acting is truly Oscar worthy! Especially Toni Collette! I hope the academy will not forget about her! Mine main issue is the third act! There's a point where it become your average horror movie - done much better of course - and it felt so out of place what the film built that point. There are some silly moments and I have many questions about the ending! In conclusion it's a good flick, a rare treasure in this day and age but ending became to goofy for my personal taste!",6,0,1,8 July 2018
Deadpool 2," One of the most desperate movie I ever seen!
","This is movie is so desperately tried to be funny, dramatic, edgy and so on to end of it became a 2 hour long cringefest. The first one was fine, I look at it as parody of superhero movies, nothing groundbreaking but enjoyable! This one is just pathetic! One-two jokes were funny but most of them are annoying trash and in-jokes who only the well informed can understand. Technically done better than first one which I appreciate but almost all the characters were annoying but the cringiest part of this film is when it's tried to be 'dramatic'! The movie breaks the fourth wall every five minutes to tell us a cheap joke about the last film box office success or how Logan died and few moments later it tried to act like a film with real consequences and drama and it's just pure cringe because the film does it unironically with sad music and so on.'Oh somebody died! Feel sad' few minutes later: 'Luck is unfilmable!'  And of course films has no consequences because the we need a million DP sequel after that. But sure I will not see any other sequel after that!",3,3,5,8 July 2018
