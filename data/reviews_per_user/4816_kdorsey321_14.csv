Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows
","Saw the movie 'Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows,' starring Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, and Jared Harris. Honestly, my very first thoughts, when I saw the trailer for the first time, was this doesn't look like its going to top the first one...It looks alright...I needed a little more to go on. But honestly that is what I thought about the first Sherlock Holmes movie and I ended up loving it. I ended up loving this one too. Matter of fact, I can't wait to go see it again. What I believe people want to see, even more than the action, is the battle of wits between Sherlock Holmes and Professor James Moriarty. This movie provides that throughly. To me that was the main ingredient the movie needed! You will witness these two battle it out and out smart each other to the very end of the movie! The action in this movie was very fitting for the kind of movie this is. Guy Ritchie(director) does a great job once again of providing the action necessary to complement this movie. He also does the slow motion movements that we all loved in the first movie. I'm glad Robert Downey Jr. is back! He is starting to become one of my favorite actors. He does a great job playing Sherlock Holmes and Jared Harris does an excellent job bring Professor Moriarty to life. The big question is, is the Sherlock Holmes 2 better than the first one? I say its better! Only by a hair though, because the first won was excellent! When this movie comes out on DVD and people have had enough time to take a look at it. I will give you a specific breakdown of both movies and what parts/things of each movie is better than the other. Overall, I think this is a great movie! Great acting, solid battle of wits, action is satisfactory...I'm going to give 'Sherlock Holmes 2' a 10 out of 10.",10,3,6,26 December 2011
Ted," Only Ted
","For my next movie review, I'm doing a review on the movie 'Ted,' starring Ted, Mark Wahlberg, and Mila Kunis.There was a lot of fuss about this movie and whether it would be good or not. I'm here to tell you that it was a pretty descent film. You have to remember that the main character in this film is a talking bear and it's a comedy. So you have to open your mind a little and bare with it. With that said, I can also see why people wouldn't quite enjoy this film.The movie 'Ted' is a solid comedic movie that is guaranteed laughs. Sometimes you just have to have a little fun with movies and the film 'Ted' definitely represents that. I also have to admit that Mark Wahlberg was pretty funny in this film. He hasn't dazzled me before with his attempts to be funny, but in this film he gave me a couple of laughs too.I'm giving this film a 7 out of 10. This film could have been awful, but they put together a descent plot and made numerous attempts to keep the comedy coming. This isn't a 'rush to the movies and see film,' but if you're bored and you need a couple laughs, this would be a solid matin√©e treat. Hope y'all enjoyed the review!",7,1,4,3 August 2012
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Attention To Detail
","Got a chance to check out the movie 'Tinker Tailor Solider Spy,' starring Gary Oldman(The Dark Knight), Mark Strong(Sherlock Holmes), and Tom Hardy(The Dark Knight Rises). My first thought when I saw the previews for this movie is that it looks like a good movie. Then I said to myself, 'Gary Oldman is in it, so how bad can it be.' Gary Oldman is starting to become one of my favorite actors.At any rate, this is a movie about a man that was forced out of retirement, but is asked to investigate a mole in the circle of his former job. George Smiley's former occupation was an intelligence officer. Smiley must find the mole that was in his former group so he can figure out the problem they had in their former operation. Which took place in Budapest, Hungary. This movie takes place in the early 1970's.(Cold War)I have many thoughts about this movie so please bare with me! This is a movie that is going to be a little boring to some. This is a movie that you have to pay attention to. You may have to watch this movie twice, or even three times! To fully comprehend. Its a little hard to place what is going on at times in this movie. There were times it seems like they were going back in time, but it was a little hard for me to be sure. So there were parts in this movie were I made my first assumption and just stuck with it. What made this movie a little easy to follow(for first time watchers) was the acting that was done well. Gary Oldman might receive an Oscar for this movie. If you get lost, just pay close attention to what the actors are doing and that should give you a comfortable grasp of what is going on. This movie also has some gruesome scenes that were surprising. There are some parts that make you say 'did that really happen,' or 'did he or she just say that?' If you were suspecting a shoot em up bang bang kind of movie, this is not the movie for you.Overall it is a solid movie. The acting is great. You have to keep in mind that your probably going to have to really be into these kinds of movies to fully appreciate this one. I give this movie the final rating of 7 out of 10.",7,4,7,8 January 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Detective?
","My next movie review is on the movie 'The Adventures of Tintin,' starring Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thomson, and Thompson. I honestly had forgotten about Tintin. When I saw the previews for this movie it brought great joy because this is something that was apart of my childhood. Even though the cartoon series is a little blurry to me. This movie is about the courageous Tintin going on a quest to find buried treasure! He gets clues as to what is going on and his curious nature attacks immediately!Even though its a little typical I thought it was a well put together animation film. I liked it a lot and I'm looking forward to getting it on DVD. The adventure in the movie was on point! Everything you could ask for in this kind of movie. This movie was fun, exciting, adventurous, and had some comedy in it too. I think lots of kids would like this movie. The only thing about kids watching this film that you should be aware of is that there is someone getting shot down in the movie and the captain is drinking though out the movie. If your child is mature enough to watch that than you and your family should have a great time watching this film. This is definitely going to be some kids favorite childhood movie. These type of films make me happy that I was born when I'm born so I can enjoy such movies.A couple of little things that I liked about the movie are how the directors made a reference to the old 'Tintin' television series. I also liked how when the pocket thief got smacked he had birds flying around his head. It reminded me of how cartoons were back in the day. It was a refreshing reminder. It immediately made me think of 'Roger Rabbit' when the birds were flying around his head. Plus I thought Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were great picks to play the police officers Thomson and Thompson.I'm giving this movie an 8 out of 10. I enjoyed watching it and I can't wait to see the second movie that they obvious set us up for at the end of this one.",8,0,3,28 January 2012
21 Jump Street," Funny as expected
","Checked out the movie '21 Jump Street,' starring Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and Ice Cube. This movie is about two guys that were not cool with each other in high school, but ended up being best friends, as they got older though helping each other become cops. When they became cops they ended up having to team up to stop a high school drug lord from selling illegal drugs to students within the school.Yes, this movie is as funny as you expect it to be. I will admit that I was scared that the only funny parts would have been the parts we seen in the previews, but that wasn't the case in this film. Just about everyone that participated in this movie gave you something to laugh about. This movie was funny pretty much the whole way though. You could tell they had a great time filming this movie. This movie wasn't just funny, it also has an enjoyable plot that wasn't over the top. The plot fit very well and the extra character in this movie made sense. This movie is a 'great time' for a hour and a half.Even Channing Tatum was funny. I point him out specifically because it was a little hard for me to see him playing a funny role in a film. Being though in other movies he usually played a more serious role. Besides that, look at him. He doesn't quite strike you as the person that is going to make you laugh. All in all, he has some parts that were pretty funny. Overall, I felt like this was a movie that was meant to be funny. I felt as though this was a movie that you wanted to escape life for a hour and a half and just laugh as much as you could, and this movie provides that. This movie has good laughs, good plot, and its a good movie! I give the movie the rating of 8 out of 10.",8,0,5,17 March 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," questionable camouflage
","Checked out the movie 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,' starring Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, and Christopher Plummer. When I first saw the previews with this movie I was very intrigued! I was like thinking to myself, 'what is going on in this movie?' There's a cool looking girl with wild hair and tattoos all over the place. Plus the title of the movie is 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.' I thought it was one of the most intriguing movie titles I had ever heard. It just made me wonder. Then I remember looking at other titles like 'The Girl That Kicked The Hornet's Nest' and 'The Girl That Plays With Fire,' and I was thinking, 'is this a trilogy or something?' Then I find out its an international best selling trilogy novel! Even though I didn't see the other movies and I didn't read the novel I just had to look at this movie. It was wearing on me. I just had to know what all the excitement was about.Now that that is out of the way, I honestly felt like the movie was okay. I didn't feel like it was one of the best films of the year and I felt a little confused...and empty. As far as twist goes this movie was kind of like dangling a carrot in front of a rabbit, but not quite letting the rabbit have the carrot. When it seemed like it was time for the rabbit to have the carrot, the carrot was still not delivered to him. Then what I felt like was an awesome climax was even a climax. There was still more to the story that wasn't bad, but they could have let Henrik be the one to give Mikael the evidence for the Wennerstrom case. I felt like there wasn't a need to show how Lisbeth got the evidence and eventually got him killed due to financial swapping. I understand she loved him and love will make you do some crazy things but he warned her and I thought the movie was suppose to be about solving a case that deal with a woman that was missing for 40 years.Then the sub plot...I'm just going to call it Lisbeth versus Nils was questionable. I say questionable as far as, should this have even been in the movie. Its not about the gruesomeness of it at all, I just felt like there could have been a different sub plot of a different way to show that Lisbeth just has bad luck with things...Okay, it is also important to keep in mind that there is a lot of dialogue in this movie. So there are going to be moments were you might get a little bored, but at the same time you have to pay attention to understand the little details and clues that are giving to you though out the film. Its also important to know that there are going to be some parts of this film that are going to be hard for the eye to see. There are some disturbing parts and gruesome parts in this film! So if you're not a fan of that, you might not want to watch this film. I say that because I know there are people that do not like to watch stuff like that.I tell you what I do like about this film. I did like character Lisbeth(main female character) in this film. She was sharp, smart, different, cool looking, and interesting to watch though out the whole film. I will say it was interesting to see how she handles things and what her response would be to certain things that happened in the movie. I also like the fact that she got some revenge and you will know what I'm talking about once you watch the film. I also enjoyed the different feel of the movie too. This movie felt different for reasons I can't quite explain, but enjoyed.I'm giving this film a 6.5 out of 10. This film is overrated to me, too much hype. There's no real twist in the movie. Plus I felt like there were things that could have been done different and things that didn't need to be in this film. I love different just like the rest of the world, but when you put in it movie form, the movie has to gel and be delivered properly.",7,1,4,29 January 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Brilliant
","Up next I'm doing a movie review on the movie 'The Amazing Spiderman,' starring Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Rhys Ifan.A lot of people were saying this film came out too fast. They should have waited a couple more years to revamp this film. I'm not going to lie to you, I was so excited that it was coming out in July; I didn't even care about how fast it came out. It's crazy how they messed up the third Spiderman movie so bad that they had to revamp the whole series.I loved this film! 'The Amazing Spiderman' was simply brilliant! I felt that they did a great job of showing Spiderman's origin. I like how they made it so Spiderman had a little bit more of a personality and wasn't too nerdy. In the comics, he wasn't ready that nerdy/shy. Nothing wrong with those qualities, but Spiderman was a regular guy that was just very intelligent.I also thought The Lizard was done well too. The Lizard was a good bad guy to choose. I like how they showed how The Lizard was a good person that was just looking for a cure and got addicted to the cure. I also loved how they put Gwen Stacy in the film. Peter Parker and her love story was fun to watch. Emma Stone did an excellent job as usual. There are so many things I love about this film, I could go on forever.I'm giving this film an 8 out of 10. This film had great execution, good acting, and it's just an all out awesome film. If you're a Spiderman fan and, you followed the comics you are going to enjoy this film more than anyone. Definitely see it in the theaters if you have a chance. Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed the review!",8,2,4,1 August 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol
","I got a chance to check out the movie 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol,' starring Tom Cruise, Paula Patton, and Simon Pegg, and Jeremy Renner. Twenty people told me to watch this movie! They said I was going to love and I would be more than glad to do a review on this movie. Honestly the first thought that came to my mind is; 'Simon Pegg is in the movie?' What is he doing in a movie like this? After that it looked like a must see movie! I just want to start off saying that the gadgets and technology in this movie was off the chain! The gadgets that were displayed in this movie were by far the best I have ever seen in a movie. That invisible wall that they put up so the guy couldn't see them break into the room was simply amazing. That was my favorite one! The fight scenes were also done well! When some one got hit the sound effects was on point. You definitely turned your head on some of those hits because the sound effects were eye openers! The Action in this movie was on point too. Sandstorms, crazy stunts, crazy jumps, Tom Cruise is simply the man! When you have movies like these you often say to yourself, what can the mission be now. You have seen so many movies and so many missions in movies that it doesn't even make since by now. The overall mission was a kinda repeated, but what they had to do to stop it was different. They made the mission very good! I always look for the difference in missions with theses kinds of movies. To harp on Simon Pegg's role in the movie, he was great because of course he was the comic relief and he was funny. If your a Simon Pegg fan you are going to love him in this movie. Its a little bit of a different role for him, but he shows some versatility. Overall, I thought this was a great movie! If you haven't scene it yet, go see it! Matter of fact, go see it again so we can talk about the gadgets(smiles). It is definitely movie theater worthy and it is DVD worthy! I give this movie a 9 out of 10!",9,2,5,22 December 2011
Drive," Whoa!
","'Drive' is the next film I'm doing a movie on. This movie stars Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, and Albert Brooks.This movie is wild, with a capital W! This film brings you surprising kills, gruesome violence, and insane action all because a random driver wanted to help a neighbor. With that said, I thought the film was pretty good. Ryan Gosling's character's personality in this film is unexplainable, but I like it. You can't really pin point who he is and I thought that was important in this film.For the record, this is not a film for everyone. There gruesomeness in this film that is simply not for everyone's eyes. The one knock on this that is a little baffling to me is that the plot in this film has nothing to do with the title of the movie. For whatever reason, that bothers me.This is a solid film with eye gluing execution. I'm giving this film a 7 out of 10. This movie came out in 2011 and I didn't get a chance to see it in the movie theaters. I'd say this is worth seeing once and definitely worth renting. Hope you guys enjoyed the review!",7,0,2,5 August 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Him Verse The World
","My next movie review is going to be on the film 'The Adjustment Bureau,' starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and Anthony Mackie. My very first thoughts when I saw this movie coming out is that it looks different. As a movie watcher you always want something different. Something that no one has came up with. As viewers we crave that, and that's what I believed I saw when I watched the previews for this movie.This movie is about a man(Matt Damon) that is just living his life and finds out that there is a higher power that regulates what goes on in everyone's life. He doesn't like there game and he wants to make his own rules. Through his journey he meets a woman and they challenge the higher power to try and stop some adjustments that they have(Matt Damon and woman) made. Who knows if they'll be able to live to tell this story...I liked the movie. This movie was different. I was expecting a little more, but I'm satisfied with what I got. For some reason I was expecting some kind of twist or something. Yet and still, I feel like this was a very good movie. This movie does make you think though. This is a movie that conspiracy theorist will go crazy for. I'm almost positive there are many of them referring to this movie to prove some kind of point. For the average viewer I approve this movie and I also feel like it is DVD worthy. This is a movie that can go into your collection, without feeling like you have to just buy the movie because you are a big Matt Damon fan. I'm giving this movie a 8 out of 10.",8,3,4,9 January 2012
In Time," Nice Concept
","Checked out the movie 'In Time,' starring Justin Timberlake, Cillian Murphy, and Amanda Seyfried. This movie is about time actually being the currency of a world instead of money being the currency of a world. Two people are doing whatever they can to save time and save as many people as possible from the dominating wealthy people who want all the time in the for themselves. A very interesting concept to me! I really love the concept of this film. I feel like it was simply nice to see something other than money be the motivational key to why someone is rich or poor. This movie is a solid action thriller. The fight scenes are done pretty well. That is always nice to witness in a action movie. There's just something about this movie that I really like, but I can't quite put my finger on it. I thought Justin Timberlake did a very good acting job. I can tell that he'll be in more films and I look forward to that. I also feel like this movie hit all cylinders. I felt like there was nothing missing. I give this film a 8 out of 10. This was a solid film that I think everyone should give a try at least once. I plan on getting it on DVD one day, but its definitely worth a Redbox or Netflix's purchase!",8,5,7,11 February 2012
Dark Shadows," Could have been better
","Got a chance to check the movie 'Dark Shadows,' starring Johnny Deep, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Chloe Grace Moretz. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was under the impression that it was a comedy. I believe this film tried to get the best of both worlds, meaning funny and serious, but just didn't succeed. When this film tried to be serious, there was so much corny entered into it before the seriousness of the movie arrived. It made it hard to take the movie seriously. When the film tried to be funny, it just wasn't really funny at all. There were very few parts of this movie that I felt were funny even a little bit and I'm not a hard person to make laugh. Maybe I'll watch it again one day and I'll say something different. I'd say one of the bright spots of this film was that Johnny Deep was in it and he didn't do a bad acting job. It was also nice to see Michelle Pfeiffer in a movie again too. I thought it was nice to see Chloe Grace Mortez in another movie too. I've been a fan of hers ever since the movie 'Kick Ass.' Besides that I really didn't feel as thought there were any other good things about this film. Which is a shame because I heard that this was once a television show and the television show was pretty awesome.With that said I'm giving this film a 6 out of 10. I'm not saying this is the worst film that I've ever seen, but I can't give this movie a rating of anything higher than a six. I believe this film is still out in the movie theater, but don't see it. I'm not getting this film on DVD. If you're curious about the movie feel free to get it on Redbox for a 'dollar' or wait for it to come on Netflix/TV. It's at least worth that.",6,0,0,31 May 2012
Prometheus," Not bad, but not great either
","My next movie review is on the movie 'Prometheus': starring Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Logan Marshall-Green. Honestly, this wasn't a bad film. You have to understand that this movie is a prequel to what is to come. With that in mind, you really can't say this is a bad film. I thought the execution is this film was great! In an introduction form, this film gives you a very good understanding as to what happen and how the aliens came about.I also thought the technology is this film was awesome. It was just great to look at. This movie definitely reminds you of what is to come in the future and how advance things can be one day. I love when a movie shows off outstanding technology and this movie definitely did that. Just a reminder, there are some gross scenes in this movie that are not easy on the stomach so if you are a person that has stomach problems, you might want to watch this film at a certain time.Now with all of that said, I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10. Deep down I felt like this movie was okay at best and I wanted more action. This movie had plenty of opportunities to bring action into it and it didn't cease the moments. Overall, I even felt as thought the movie could have been done better. You don't have to go to the movies to see this film. This movie won't be in my DVD collection unless, the next movies in its series to come are so good that it wouldn't make since not to get this one. What for this one on Redbox!",7,0,1,9 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Awesome Trilogy
","My next movie review is going to be on the highly anticipated film 'The Dark Knight Rises,' starring Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Michael Caine, and Anne Hathaway.'The Dark Knight Rises' is simply amazing! It made the last Batman series of its time a golden trilogy. It had a tough task of following up the epic movie 'The Dark Knight' and it followed it well. It wasn't better than 'The Dark Knight' (I didn't expect it to be) but it was definitely a great film in its own right.Anne Hathaway did a great job playing Catwoman. Christopher Nolan put her in a position to play Catwoman gracefully. Get job on Christopher Nolan and Anne Hathaway's part. Bane was awesome! I had a little problem understanding what he was saying at times, but overall I loved his character in the film.I'm giving this movie a 9 out of 10. This is a great film, with a great plot, and solid execution. If you are a Batman fan of any kind you will appreciate this film more than anyone. Definitely go see it and enjoy the film! I hope you enjoyed the review!",Null,11,15,1 August 2012
