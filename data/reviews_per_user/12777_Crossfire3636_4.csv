Black Swan," The most haunting...but brilliant movie of the year!!!!!
","Many people may think this is simply a ballet movie. Ballet is the central theme, but it is also the most dark and twisted main stream movie i have seen. 'Things aren't as they seem' is also a central element, which makes the movie very haunting. Most things don't bother me, but some scenes in this movie made me say 'Oh my G-d!' Natalie Portman's performance of a professional perfectionist ballerina who descends into madness while also becoming the part of the black swan in her ballet performance and personal life is nothing less than amazing. Absolutely recommended, but NOT for kids in the least. Prepare to be disturbed, yet amazed.",10,0,1,4 April 2011
Kick-Ass," In MY humble opinion
","I was very skeptical about seeing this movie: it looked like another one of those stupid trying-to-be-funny kid romps. Then i saw that it was a controversial over the top violent action movie, so i said, hey, why not. I went to see it with a friend and we both had the same verdict. TWO THUMBS DOWN. I thought ONE line was funny, the rest was just what I thought it would be: teens and little kids TRYING to be funny. I also don't mind brutal action movies, but NOT starring little kids. I was honestly pleasantly surprised that Ebert gave this movie 1 and a half stars. The action scenes were great, but only if they had been done by grownup. If these kids were in an all out comedy, that would be different, but they weren't so...I am probably the only one who hated this movie, but that just my humble opinion.",1,32,66,25 April 2010
How to Train Your Dragon," Wow
","I went into this movie KNOWING, from reviews, that it would be great, but was I misinformed. It was INCREDIBLE! Action-Packed, great animation, story, characters, screenplay, funny in some parts, and emotional. Because of scary parts, i wouldn't recommend it to young kids, but to everyone else, SEE IT!!!!!!!!!! This may be my favorite animated movie of all time, or one of them. And YES, i was shedding some tears at the end. I hope to see it a few more times before it leaves theatres. Not NECESSARY to see it in 3D, just because 3d is SOOO expensive. You will get the same enjoyment seeing 2d!!!!!!!!!! I haven't seen the awards section of HTTYD but if it hasn't won any, it should. SEE IT",10,1,3,27 April 2010
Inception," Can a movie get any better than being an experience?
","Inception was one of those movies after which you are left with not only an amazingly exciting feeling, but the feeling that you experienced a film instead of merely viewed it. Granted, being directed by Christopher Nolan, this is hardly a surprise. The viewer follows Dom Cobb, and expert in idea extraction during sleep, in other words idea theft. After accepting a proposition, Cobb assembles team who will use Inception to PLANT an idea in one's subconscious during their sleep. The general idea of the movie is simple, but when you add Cobb's previous experience with inception, complications with the sleep subject, Cobb's memories and obsessions, and the actual execution of the team's plan, the plot gets deeper and more complicated. Director Nolan gives us bits and pieces of information throughout the film about what the idea is that will be incepted and why, but how inception is actually achieved is the whole point and excitement of the experience. Inception will most certainly require multiple viewings because it is impossible to understand every detail during the first time around. Plus, it's just great to see the film again and again. There are some slow parts during explanation of certain things and the movie borrows mildly from The Matrix, but those are mild hiccups during the road of adventure. Not one scene is out of place, each love scene is completely appropriate, the action was well-paced and not just included for the sake of action, and the running time was perfect. Even the acting was well done for a sci-fi action picture. All in all, I was left with a total sense of viewing completion and satisfaction. This movie is a pivotal point in my movie-watching history because for me, the level of enjoyment of any movie I see in the future will be judged against and compared to the incredible level of enjoyment I experienced during Inception.",10,3,7,20 July 2010
