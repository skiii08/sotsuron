Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," he'd go to Irak and make a joke on war or muslims?
","First, i really laugh at some scenes even though they were horrible. But jokes on bad things happening right now around the world???, incest,pedophiles, woman abuse, poverty... Those things are not to make fun, do you laugh when you see a woman beaten or a child raped??. The only passable (or mediocre at his best) parts of the film where those that showed the proud and selfconfort in what north Americans live, and those explain why they got a 'warlord in the white house' the best sentence in the film, if not the only one. The dining society scene was so laughable not because Borat's stupid jokes but because those people do really meet for dinner in that way, and if a b1tch entered the pastor would go running like she was a lepper, did Jesus the same or he would say: Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone. Well it could be a set up, most scenes were an obvious set up, but others were so bad they must have been for real. You can laugh for a second but you have to recognize that this is trash. OMFG what are we coming to?? borat is almost on 250imdb with 7.8,and Oscar nominations, and golden globe wins??. Stop the world, i am getting down.",1,12,26,2 January 2007
Dawn of the Dead," A could-be-good remake
","I have to admit that the old Dawn of the dead is for me the best zombie film ever, good and simple script, unknown actors, total chaos... but here i review the 2004 film. First i'd say i don't like fast moving zombies at all, zombie's charm is in the slowness, it makes them so scary. The mayor flaw of the remake (besides the zombie baby!?! which was so unfortunate) is in the script of course, the characters never admit that they could end up living inside the mall, like they did in the 70's film where they made at home inside, and in the end were the humans who f4ck them up. Here script writers came up with a stupid salvation convoy and a more senseless boat scape, a 'made in Hollywood' ending. Zombie movies are doomed because is the way they should end up. This genre admits no innovation, we don't need explanation for the undead awakening, no zombie character development (did i said that?), and only a small hope for humans like in our real world. So please respect zombie movies standards.",2,1,4,20 March 2007
Spider-Man 3," You can't base a script on coincidences
","This film's script looks like the result of mixing two different scripts, two films in one, even three films sometimes, everything is based on coincidences that may convince a young kid, but that turn down the entire story. The story of the sandman is put in here needlessly just to add some more spice, a fourth film could have been made with it. The venom part if well done could be enough for a film along with the goblin. I will not speak about Tobeys acting, the nerd Peter is way to much boring, confusing, stupid; i kinda liked the bad Peter at least he does something, he reacts, and it's funny. With so high budget they could have done better, but in the end what does it matter the budget when a script is senseless?.",5,0,2,17 May 2007
The Prestige," the prestige has no prestige
","A film that you know the end from the beginning must be a very good film to catch the attention of the audience, like a good trick of magic or like good films like 'memento' or 'usual suspects'. If we know the end at least we expect some interesting history, a real plot, good characters, not just a pretentious film. Here we only have two magicians going all the way around each other, with an obvious twist that evolves into a sci-fi twist which nobody wants to see because we already know. I'd say that the acting of the three main characters is very good (Bale is superb as always, and Jackman is improving), s. Johanson is also OK but her character could be off the film and nobody would notice.",2,3,12,16 April 2007
Snatch," Big miscasting but still entertaining
","Brad Pitt as a gypsy?? haha the good nice boy from Hollywood,who'd buy it?, that was a del toro's character, the two fingered boy could have been Pitt (or anyone else). The off-voice also becomes really unpleasant as we're no teens and we like to think sometimes. Now the pros, the better acting here is clearly delivered by Brick Top (Alan Ford a TV actor semi-unknown) he is funny and terrifying at one time. The second best is delivered by Vinnie Jones, a one-face tough boy actor but why should he change if he is good at it?. The intricate and rather ridiculous plot is based on coincidence (Ritchie is London that small?)but keeps you focused on the film, the problem is that when you finish there's not much to remember. Obscene high rate on IMDb.",6,0,1,11 July 2007
Transformers," Embarrassing teenager movie
","I usually see this box office films at home, without any other objective than being entertained or just get asleep at bed, but sometimes even with this low expectations i get caught in something so bad than i can't even sleep because of anger. That is the case, that's why i'm posting here. Remembering all those actors senseless running like beheaded chicken is a matter of laughing or crying, but not film-making. All those characters without purpose, the marines, the 'hot hacker', the proverbial funny fat black boy, those actors like Voight(lost a long time ago)and Turturro?!(by the way the only one acting here). Oh my god! The hot girl who nobody know why loves the teenager nerd who suddenly becomes quarterback and saves the world, haven't you heard about it?. I don't know if this had a script, it should be two pages long. If that is, the writers guild could take a long strike, now i'm dreaming it could last forever.",1,8,16,3 November 2007
Garden State," Don't waste your time.
","You'd be better doing ANYTHING else that watching this. The film has an 8/10 in IMDb which explains why the world is coming to an end: because we are stupid senseless fools. Well the film is boring as hell, i'm not gonna review the film itself because it's clear and simply empty, nothing happens, nothing matters to him, is a film about nothing and that's why people thinks it is about 'life and deep emotions', because our lifes are nothing. I suggest you all to go and see more bad reviews because some are really funny and clever and of course much more inspiring that the film. This pointless emo crap is embarrassing, i couldn't stand to watch so i played forward only to become close to suicide in the final scenes. The only thing that make me really think in this film was the question about what were Holm and Portman smoking when they did it. Braff please retire to the wild jungle, find peace with your inner self, go to Tibet, go talk with God, Al√°, Buda, whatever, but please save us from your direction skills.",1,2,4,16 December 2006
The Departed," who else was fooled?
","If the academy was in doubt with Scorsese, now i'm afraid it's him who is in doubt with them. Come on you serious about this movie??. 72 on IMDb??? This really needed to be so complicated??, did the endless ending needed to be that bloody??, do we really need so many main characters to make a good film??, more than two hours long??, Can someone believe this??, why that scene in the graveyard copying the third man??, and the most important thing: what was this film about??, did you feel something??, can't you remember a memorable, touching, funny or innovative scene?? From now on i hate cell phones.PD. I loved goodfellas, casino, raging bull, taxi driver, but that wouldn't stop me.",2,4,9,2 March 2007
