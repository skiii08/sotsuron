Captain Phillips," An excellent movie, no complaints at all!
","Captain Phillips is an amazing movie. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire time. Such a well made film, everything seemed so real. I also heard that it was very true to the actual story which is great. The acting was incredible, particularly because the four main Somali actors had no experience at all. Their acting was flawless, along with the rest of the cast. Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Captain Phillips. I can't wait until the movie is released on DVD so that I can show it to my friends and family! It's now my favourite movie! No complaints whatsoever. Watch captain Phillips and you will not be disappointed!!!",10,1,4,5 January 2014
