50 First Dates," Simply hysterical!
","I will tell you now. I am not a big Adam Sandler fan. I mainly saw this because Sean Astin is in it, and last night, gave it a shot with my friend. With in the first 5 minutes, we were cracking up. Incase you don't know, the movie is about Henry Roth is a guy who normally has one night flings with the tourist visiting Hawaii. That is until he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) and falls in love with her. The only problem is that she suffers from short term memory loss, that doesn't last through the night. Every day she wakes up, she thinks it's the same day as her accident. Her father, Marlin Whitmore (Blake Clark) and her brother Doug (Sean Astin) try to keep the secret from her by doing the same thing everyday, like watching the same football game, painting the same room... you get it. Henry will stop at nothing to get Lucy to remember him, but Doug and Marlin tell him to give up and stay away from the local diner which Lucy has breakfast at... everyday. This sets up for a 10 minute series of comedic events that will have you falling off your seat, including one moment where Henry's good friend, Ula (Rob Schneider) get beat with a bat by Lucy.Now, the acting is great. Sandler provides comic relief at all the right times. Schneider plays Ula, who has smoked one (hundred) too many joints, and plays the character great, and makes for some good shark bait. Sean Astin... I can't say enough. To go from the nice, humble, slightly overweight hobbit sidekick, Sam Gamgee to a buffed up, steroid user with a lisp here, he has proved he is an actor, and may just get a best supporting actor nod for a Comedy/Musical for the Golden Globes, next year. Drew Barrymore is a fine female lead in the movie, playing the forgetful Lucy. Also, she kicks Rob Schnider and Adam Sandler's butt in this movie.My final word: If you want a great comedy movie, or need a movie for a first date, this is it. I'm giving it 5 out of 5 stars due to the great acting by the trio of Sandler, Schnider and Astin. Bravo Adam, Bravo!",10,0,0,21 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best. Movie. EVER!!!
","I saw ROTK on opening day. I knew I was going to love it, and my friends loved it too. If you want a good action/war film, see this, but see the Fellowship and The Two Towers first! The CGI effects were incredible, and the battle scenes were amazing.",10,0,0,19 December 2003
