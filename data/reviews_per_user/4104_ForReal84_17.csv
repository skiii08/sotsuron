50 First Dates," Wouldn't It Be NiceOh it is
","50 First Dates is the funniest movie of 2004 to date. It's hard to believe that there are people in the world who have short-term memory loss, it's even hard to believe how funny and original this movie is. For Henry Roth his life usually consists of hanging out with his friends, working with the animals that he now calls family, and preparing for a big trip that he plans to take in his boat. One day while out testing the boat, the boat breaks down and he is forced to get to land. He enters a nice little diner where the characters inside are as colorful as it is outside. This is where he meets Lucy Whitmore, a beautiful woman with a carefree attitude. After one change meeting the two make an instant bond, after hours of talking and laughing the two decide to meet again the very next day at the same time. Sounds good rightwrong, to Henry's surprise Lucy has no idea who he is. He soon leans that Lucy suffers from short-term memory loss, now Henry is out to make the woman of his dreams fall in love with him everyday.50 First Dates is a laugh out loud comedy that will have everyone in a good mood. The re-teaming of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore is awesome. The two have great screen chemistry, if this time around is as successful as The Wedding Singer one may expect to see another film featuring the two actors. And if the amount of people that were at the theater that I saw this at is any indication as to how big this film is going to be, then I'm getting in line now for their next movie. The always-funny Rob Schneider is the funniest I have ever seen him. His portrayal of Ula, one of Henry's friends is in short a performance by a comic mastermind. Sean Astin came out of nowhere and turned in a very funny performance as Lucy's muscle bound brother. All in all, 50 First Dates is a great movie with an awesome cast of characters, it is a feel good movie that will leave a little imprint on your heart. Ok so it may not do that but the movie is funny. 3.6 out of 4 and an A-",8,0,0,15 February 2004
Monster," Sometimes the Monster in all of us comes out
","Monster is the true story of Aileen Wuornos, a young woman who is on a self-destructive path. Along the way she meets Selby, a naive woman who is trapped in a world where being who you truly are is not permissible. Set in the 80's Monster follows the relationship that the two women have together and their escape from the `real' world. While trying to better their own lives, Aileen begins to take the lives of some unsuspecting men. Two some the story may be long and dull, but beneath the story there is a woman who is lost in her own world. She lived a tormented life where the only rule was to shut up and take what's being given to you. Charlize Theron gives the performance of a lifetime. She plays Aileen in a way where you can actually feel bad for her. In reality Aileen was a horrible woman who killed because she felt that life owed her something, on the surface Charlize creates a character both horrible and charming. She only wants to live a life far different then she has ever been accustomed too, she wants Selby to be happy, but most important she wants to find happiness. I believe that Charlize does something that not too many actresses have done before; she has taken herself completely out of her body and transformed herself in Aileen. There is a lot of tale out the makeup and how she had to gain weight, well anyone can make themselves look ugly, but what Theron does is something far more challenging then making herself look unattractive, she really embodies Aileen. She gives the BEST performance of the year! She is outstanding and extremely captivating, I found it hard to take my eyes off of her. The only problem with a performance this good is how will she top it? The answer is she won't, she'll only grow as an actress. I don't think she will ever be able to play someone like this again, and I don't think that's a bad thing. Theron is brilliant here; I think this is a once in a lifetime performance. I hope that after this movie fades she is still considered a wonderful actress. As for the other performances, oh yes there where other people in this movie. First off there is the always-amazing Christina Ricci as Selby, here Ricci plays the naive woman who is out to find happiness in herself. It's a shame that Theron over shadows her, but for Ricci this character seems like a broken record. I feel that Ricci has done this before, and while I feel it's always ok to play a similar character, I think it's one thing when you play these types of people over and over again. Monster is a very important story; it is a film about the relationship between two people and the road they take in life.It's a story for anyone who has tried to live a better life, for anyone who feels that life never goes their way. I give Monster 3.8 stars out of 4 and an A-.",Null,0,0,7 February 2004
Dawn of the Dead," This dawn is no yawn
","DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) is one of the best remakes or re-envisioning of a classic film. Actually this is not a remake at all, everything is different expect for the title and the whole mall idea. While I am a huge fan of the original and I believe that it is stupid and a waste of time to revisit an old idea, I found this film to be better then the original concept. I can't imagine what it would be like if something like this were to happen in `real' life. I'm happy that this hasn't happened yet, but it is quite an experience watching it happen to a group of characters. When I first heard that there was going to be another film called Dawn of the Dead, I was hoping that it was not going to be in any way connected to the one that I have seen a million times. I mean if you saw the remake of the original Night of the Living Dead, then you may know what I'm talking abouttalk about a waste of time, that was one of the worst films I have ever seen. But back to the new Dead, I saw the first ten minutes of the film air on the USA network a couple of days ago and from then on I was hooked. It stopped right after the main character Ana crashes her car into a tree. Sitting in the theater I couldn't wait for that to finish so I could see the rest of the film. Believe me I was not let down, I think that this is an awesome movie filled with some great scares and a few laughs. So many times horror films lose steam half way through the film, but Dawn only built up steam. From the first ten minutes one can get a sense that this is going to be a fast paced film, and see that there is not going to be much time to breath. I also found all of the characters to be very interesting, although I thought there were a few too many characters. In the original there are four people who must survive, but in the remake there are a lot more people that we have to watch out for. Many of them were just there to stand in the back, and were cause for a great death scene. After a hard day's work the only thing that Ana wanted was some r and r, but what she got was a whole different story. The film takes us on a wild ride in the lives of a group of strangers who come together to fight for their lives. After awaking to a horrifying sight, Ana must escape from the man that she has come to know and love. Soon Ana finds herself with of group of other desperate strangers who take refugee in a near by shopping mall. Inside the mall the meet three security guards and take in a rig full of helpless outsiders looking for a safe base. Inside the mall they keep out the living dead and try to go on with their lives while waiting for help. As everyone one knows that all good things must come to an end, so the group which has been downsized, decide to escape the mall and travel to an island where they can rebuild their broken lives. Now with a plan in hand a small group of the living must outsmart a large group of the dead.
Usually in most horror films there are up and coming actors (who can't act scared if a zombie bit them in the ass) who are living in their fifteen minutes of fame. Rarely do we get the treat of watching a group of talented actors scream their way through a film, well in this fright fest we are exposed to a group of very talented actors. Playing Ana, Sarah Polley delivers a strong performance playing an even stronger character. Her mix of rage and beauty helps her to take charge of the screen. Ving Rhames, whom I believe to be one of the most underrated actors, take charge in this film. He is an amazing actor and turns in another solid performance. Jake Weber and Mekhi Phifer play too very different characters and are very believable in their roles. Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth, who are reuniting a second time on screen after their small roles in another excellent horror film WRONG TURN, play their characters in unique ways. For Zegers, who has few lines, he is very demanding when he is one screen and Booth, plays the helpless girl to a tee. While all of the other actors deserve to be mentioned I think that by saying they all do an excellent job is fair enough, because many times audiences are not paying attention to the performances the actors are giving anyway.Dawn of the Dead truly is a film worth seeing. There are good performances, a solid recreation of a classic, an awesome score, many scares, and even a few laughs. If you haven't seen it go see it right now stop reading get in your car and goif not for anything else go to at least check out the ending. Dawn has one of the best endings to a horror movie that I have seen in a long time it is scary and original. I am going to give Dawn of the Dead 3.7 stars out of 4 and an A-!",8,0,0,27 March 2004
The Girl Next Door," Can I move in?
","The Girl Next Door is a really funny movie about a guy who for his whole life has played by the rules. Matt Kidman is a straight-laced guy who never does anything wrong until he sees the girl of his dreams. In his final year at high school, he decides to go a little wild. One night while taking out the garbage he sees a beautiful girl walking into the house next door. Danielle is the kind of girl that will and does change Matt's life; she turns his ordinary life into one crazy adventure after another. Soon the two bond and have a strong relationship. After a while he learns that Danielle is not who she says she is. Matt soon finds that his life is spinning out of control and the only one who can fix it is him. Now with the help of his friends he will go the limit and achieve something that no one ever though he was capable of doing. Up and comers Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert play the two leads in the film, their on screen chemistry is extremely well-matched. They are two great young actors who are perfect for their roles.  The film is very funny, a little predictable, but a good film in all. I give The Girl next Door a C + and 2.9 out of 4.",8,0,0,28 April 2004
Finding Nemo," One of the best movies of the year!
","FINDING NEMO is one of the best-animated movies to hit theaters since Monster's INC. Disney and Pixar have done another astounding job. They produce films that teach a lesson or two, but also squeeze out many laughs along the way. It is a movie about a father trying to find his only son. It turns the sea into a fast paced world of humor and fun. Like Toy Story it turns a simple idea into two hours of fun and laughs. Disney and Pixar should be awarded many awards for there achievement. Nemo is a very superior movie that has an important message. Again the special effects are amazing. Further more everything looks very true to life. It's neat how they do it. Along for the swim are Albert Brooks, Ellen Degeneres, William Dafoe, Brad Garrett, and Ailison Janney. There voice work is very funny. The characters in this film are very good. They turn ordinary fish into extraordinary characters. Ellen Degeneres should be given an Academy Award for her voice work. She is very funny as Dory. She carries many of the scenes with an effortless force of humor and innocence. Finding Nemo is a great family film of everyone. All in all it is one of the best movies to hit theaters this year. 3.89/4",10,0,0,3 June 2003
Elf," The Magic Of Christmas
","ELF is one of the best Christmas movies out there. It is funny, charming, and well acted. The always-funny Will Farrell plays Buddy, a human who grows up as an ELF. After finding out that he is not original from the North Pole, Buddy sets out on a journey to find the family that he left behind. This takes him to New York City, where he meets his dad who is anything but thrilled to see him. Now Buddy must learn that sometimes life isn't so jolly, and help the people he has just met find the Christmas spirit that is inside all of us. Co-starring in the film is James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, and Bob Newhart. Elf is a family movie that everyone both young and old will find on the top of their must see lists. 3.9 out of 5 B+",7,1,1,15 November 2003
Lost in Translation," I once was lost but now I'm found.
","Lost In Translation is one of the best films of 2003! Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have the greatest screen chemistry that I've seen in a long time. The story follows two Americans in Tokyo, and how each is in some way or another feeling a little lost. It is through their unlikely friendship that they find themselves and each other. Written and Directed by Sophia Coppola, Lost is a story that has won the hearts of almost everyone that has seen it. Coppola has done an amazing job of capturing the feeling of being lost in life when you feel no one around you understands what you may be going through. Coppola is one of the best directors to come about in recent years. Murray delivers one of his finest performances; he is serene and easy to watch. His character is the type that most can relate too. Johansson is probably more deserving of all this awards attention then Murray is. I feel that she faced the bigger challenge of this movie. She had to play a young woman who is lost and doesn't know what she wants to do with her life. For anyone that has ever been there, then you know how scary that can be. She turned in a performance of few words and captures the character in a light that most actresses her age might not. With tow of the finest performances of the year, and one of the best up and coming directors, Lost In Translation is anything but that.",Null,0,0,7 February 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Only at the movies
","What do you get when you take a great story, a good supporting cast, and add an MTV star? That's easy, you get The Butterfly Effect. Now I have to say that `Just Married' and `That 70's Show' are two very good projects in their own right, and Ashton Kutcher is a good actor, but I found him to be unbelievable in this role. There were parts that were supposed to be serious but the audience started laughing. I think that he should stick with comedy. No I'm not sure if it's right to be so judgmental, because I am a little sick of hearing about `Punked' and Demi Moore. But anyway back to the movie itself, the story line is very good; I'd even go as far to say that it was an edge of your seat thriller. It was at times very good and fasted pace. Amy Smart is really growing into a good actress and Elden Henson is good in almost everything he does. It is a very good movie with an interesting ending. 3 stars out of 4 and I'd give it a B-.",Null,0,0,25 January 2004
Seabiscuit," A second chance is worth taking
","Seabiscuit is a really good film with an amazing message; sometimes the best way to succeed is to keep trying. This is a film that centers on the lives of three very different people. Together, they take a horse that is destined to lose and turn him into one that fought all the odds to become a winning horse. I didn't think that I would like a film about a horse; in fact when it first came out I didn't want to see it. But once it started getting the entire Oscar buzz, I have to admit that I wanted to see it. I know I shouldn't judge a film on its Oscar buzz, but I did on this one, I'm so sorry. Set during the depression, Seabiscuit is a film that will have you cheering from your seat. At first I was not a fan of Tobey Maguire, I don't know what it was about him but I didn't see anything that separated him from most actor's his age, yet in this film he is on his way to becoming one of the best younger actors around. I think that he deserved a little more attention for his performance of the semi- blind racer. I found myself rooting for all of these characters; they are ordinary people who are placed in some pretty big challenges. Jeff Bridges turns in one of his finest performances ever. I think that he is one of the most underrated actors in the world, in the same boat is William H. Macy, I think that every performance that he does is great. He can really step into a character and run with it. I think that for such a small role he did a fantastic job.  I do not think that this is one of the best films of the year but it's a good movie. It kept my interest all two hours; I do however feel bad that there are people who treat horses like that. I truly believe that this film has a big heart; I love movies that have bigger messages. I like movies that take characters that are ordinary and put them in some of the most breathtaking situations. If you want a film that will make up feel good, and root for the underdog then this is a film that you should check out.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Where's the sunscreen?
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a first rate comedy that will leave you glued to the screen in amazement and confusion. This film does not have the usual characteristics that create a laugh out loud comedy; it is unusual and highly independent. It rises above most comedies and finds that a few laughs are hard to come by, but with a cast and story like this, Sunshine is a perfect comedy that keeps you guessing all the while making you laugh. No one ever said that it was easy to get over the one you love. For Joel Barish he is learning that lesson in the most extreme way. After a chance meeting with an unusual woman named Clementine Kruczynski, Joel finds that this perfect romance soon turns out to be like nothing he had ever imagined. After a strange breakup, Joel and Clementine go on their separate ways, soon Joel finds himself in the shadow of the woman that he loved, he gets an even bigger surprise when she has no idea who he is. She acts as though she never knew him, and he soon finds out that she had him erased from her mind. Now trying to get over her he does the same thing, the only way to get over her is to remove her from his mind. Along the way Joel and Clementine meet some of the strangest people to ever grace their lives. Jim Carrey plays Joel and he is amazing, I believe that he deserves to receive an Oscar nomination. This is a performance that we have never seen him in. Kate Winslet who is one of the best actresses around, turns in another first rate performance. She is very funny and has a soft side that makes for a perfect choice for this character.  Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, and Tom Wilkinson, make up a wonderful supporting cast that are all great playing each one of their characters. This really is a great movie; Charlie Kaufman has yet again given us an out of this world movie going experience sure to leave you laughing all the way to the bathroom. There is also a softer side that will make you think about what could happen if you really could erase someone from your mind. This film is so original and so great; there are also some neat twists that drive this film to a place in movie making history. I have to give this film 3.5 stars out of 4 and an A!",8,0,1,29 March 2004
Saw," * * * *
","SAW in my opinion, is one of the top ten thrillers of all time. I saw Saw last night during it second weekend of national release. Everyone was telling me that it was an awesome movie and that I had to see. It was an adventure to see it because every theater me and my friend went to it was sold out. We finally found a theater and we couldn't believe what we saw. The film starts out a little slow but after the first 30 minutes it picks up and sends you on a roller coaster. I found myself a little confused throughout the whole then, then in the last ten minutes everything comes together and I was very impressed.Saw is the story of two men who awake to a highly confusing and often scary game. Together they must put together the clues they have and solve this terrifying mystery. The acting in the film could have been a little better in my opinion, but everything really worked well together. The suspense was great and the ending was just plain amazing. It was a great movie all around and I highly recommend it!",Null,0,0,7 November 2004
Mystic River," Good...But no Great
","Mystic River is a very interesting film that keeps you guessing from the very beginning. It is filled with some strong performances and consists of an amazing screenplay. However, it gets lost somewhere. I'm not sure if I heard too much `buzz' surrounding this film that while going into it I was expecting more. It is a really great film, don't get me wrong, but too call it one of the best films of 2003 would be an over statement. It is a story about three childhood friends who reconnect years later after one of their daughters is murdered. The story takes the audience on a wild journey through self-discovery and to a place that no one would like to find themselves. I know that this all may sound a little confusing, I'm saying it's not great but it is good. I can't exactly point out where I felt let down, but I can say that I was a little disappointed by the ending. I thought the story lead us to this horrible place only to say well it wasn't what you thought and the ending is not going to be completely cleared up.Probably the best aspect of the film is the performance that it's star Sean Penn turns in. This is by far one of the most outstanding performances of the year. He is extremely captivating; he does what not too many actors could have done. He makes you feel for his character only to turn against him for a split moment and then back to a place where you feel bad for him. Tim Robbins gave another amazing performance, this is probably is best to date. Marcia Gay Harden does an excellent job in a role that could have easily been over shadowed. The film itself is a good film, it is not the best film, but it is one of the better films of 2003, it has a great story, an amazing cast, and top-notch performances. 3.0 out of 4, and a B.",Null,0,0,18 February 2004
Love Actually," Actually Good!
","Very few times does a little film have a big message. LOVE ACTUALLY actually does. The meaning behind this film is that love is all around. It may be hard to find sometimes but it is out there in its many forms. The beginning of the film starts out like a documentary, with the voice of Huge Grant talking about love. He speaks about how even in the saddest of times love is there in full bloom. Love is a very powerful word, but in this film it seems to go above and beyond its normal principles. Here, love is a simple word that overtakes the lives of the characters in the film. As hard as love is to understand lovers around the world still seem to wish and hope about one day finding that special person. The characters in LOVE are very interesting. The ranges of personalities that make the characters come to life are excellent. An outstanding cast that includes, Huge Grant, in his usually comic timing, pitch perfect performance. He plays David, a man who is in love but doesn't express his feelings right away. Although it seems like we have met Grant's character before in any of his films, here he is very fresh and funny. Colin Firth turns in another fine performance as Jamie, the loveable writer. One of the finest living actresses of today is Emma Thompson; here she only justifies this statement.  She is very funny in a role that could have been upstaged by the other actors. She plays Karen, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. She is exceptional in this film and deserves some type of recognition. Keira Knightley plays Juliet. Although she has a very simple part in the film, she plays it very well. The love triangle that she is in also makes the even better. The scene where her admirer comes to the door is actually one of the most romantic film scenes in a while. Bill Nighy turns in one of the funniest performance of the year. Bill as Billy Mack is actually one of the best aspects of the film. His comic timing is genius. He is in fact the scene-stealer. Every time he appeared on screen the audience started to laugh. Liam Neeson plays Daniel, a man deeply involved with his son after the death of his wife. The relationship between the too is very strong. He does a very good job; it's nice to see Neeson playing someone likeable. Laura Linney plays Sarah, another complicated woman. She is one of the best up and coming actresses today. She is very funny in this role, but also delivers a very soft character that is in love with one of her co-workers. The thing that makes her life so complicated is that she has to care for her brother who is sick. It's a decision that plagues her love life as well as her every day life for that matter. Linney plays Sarah the way not too many actresses could; she is complex, soft, and likeable. Alan Rickman plays Harry, a man who many may find hard to like. He does a very good job balancing a mean character with a likable personality. Martine McCutcheon plays Natalie. She is very funny in this role. A pretty new face in the film business, she looks to have a bright future. And last but not least another major player in this film is the always-funny Rowan Atkinsin. Even though he is only in the film for a few minutes he still turns in one of the funniest performances as Rufus. The film has a great supporting cast and includes a few top-notch cameos. There is a great sound track that accompanies. All in all, it's a feel good, funny as hell film that will leave you rolling in your seat. Love Actually is actually one of the best films of the year! 4.6 out of 5: A-",10,0,1,15 November 2003
Identity," A thriller with not enough Identity to be consider a work of art
","IDENTITY is a thriller about a limo driver who ends up in a mind-boggling game. The story centers on Ed, while driving an actress he gets involved in a horrible accident that leaves one person extremely hurt. Rushing the victim to the only hotel around, Ed tries to get some help. But because of the rainstorm no one can go anywhere. As more stranded people arrive at the hotel, each one begins to be killed off in a sequence that seems fit for any of the SCREAM movies. Not too long into the movie each person's Identity gets shoved to the surface, and concludes with a pretty good ending.Although this movie is good, there is nothing that makes it great, With the expectation of John Cusack, as Ed, and Ray Liotta, the other actors are turn in ordinary performances. But with Cusack and Liotta, who are two of the finest actors out there in Hollywood today, they bring some Identity to this picture. Rebecca De Mornay appears for a split second as the actress. She is also a very talented actress, her time and talent could have been used a little better.The ending to the film was pretty surprising, but like a movie that was released in 1999 starring Edward Norton, this ending brought back memories of that film. If you have seen both of these films then you will understand, but if not then you will have no idea what I am talking about. This film was pretty average, so I would have to give it a C.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Third Times the Charm!
","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the best film of the year. In fact it is the best film that I've seen in a long time. It has some of the most amazing special effects that have even been captured on screen. In the third and final installment Frodo and company conclude their epic adventure. I don't think there is anything bad that I can say about this film it is basically amazing. So many times big budgeted films get lost in the story and focus more one the special effects and the action sequences, but in this case the story line is just as important. All of the performances that are turned in by the talented actors deserve some type of recognition; I believe that they did something that a lot of actors often try to do, they try not to get lost in the story and give their characters a chance, here that's just what the actors did. Throughout this trilogy we cheered for their characters, we wished them only the best. The third installment in this series is an excellent ending to one of the most cinematic masterpieces of our time. I'm so happy to see that this film is finally winning some of the highest praises in Hollywood. I wish that Sean Astin had received a more attention for his performance; it is one of the best performances of the year. As usual Elijah Wood turned in another perfect performance. The battle scenes in this film are astonishing; I literally sat with my jaw on the floor. Never before and never again, will a beloved story capture the hearts of so many people. Peter Jackson has done it again; his vision has confined what so many have dreamed. The Lord of the Rings is a once in a lifetime achievement, it is a masterpiece it has raised the bar for this type of film. In this case it is apparent that sometime the third time really is the charm.",9,0,1,24 February 2004

Believing this to be turn everyone looks at him as a first class fish and he is given the life that he's always dreamed of. There are a lot of amazing actors in the film that provide great voice overs. There is also a lot of color that really makes this film visually exciting. There was also a few cameos that made for a good laugh. I think that kids young and old and adults old and older will really enjoy this film! I really enjoyed this film and look forward to seeing it again!",Null,1,1,7 November 2004
The Godfather," A mob of fun
","The Godfather is one of the best films ever to be made; it has everything that makes a movie worth watching. One of the great aspects of this film is the fact that it is watchable over and over again. The story line is good, no excuse me great, all of the actors from the awesome Marlon Brando, to the underrated Talia Shire turn in superb performances.    The story centers on Don Vito Carleone (Brando) and his family. James cann turns in a standout performance as Sonny. Diane Keaton's role is small but she plays the character of Kay perfect. The Godfather has one of the most gripping storylines that has come across in any film. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking. While there is no such thing as a perfect film, because someone will always find something they don't like in a movie, The Godfather is a film with few flaws. There is action, some comedy, a little romance, and tons of drama. The Godfather is about one family and how they will and do kill for each other. It's a movie that at the center is about what we all do to survive in this world. At most it's a film that will make its viewer escape their everyday reality and step into a wild that hopefully most of us haven't become accustomed to. 3.9 out of 4 stars.
