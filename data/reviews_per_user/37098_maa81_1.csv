Deja Vu," Man... This sh*t is weak
","Deja vu? Deja vu? I certainly won't have a deja vu with this one...Although several users have tried to explain the problems of time travel in the forum in here, none of them are (in my mind) able to explain the fundamental problems with this movie...Every time someone attempts to mess with time travelling, the movie leaves more problems than it answers(I won't go into them as some readers may want to watch the movie themselves), but historically 'Back to the future', 'Time machine', 'Time cop', etc. all ran into problems when going back in time and altering the future. And 'Deja Vu' is no exception.The actors do a fairly good job, but that does not make up for a weak script and an easy-to-guess-ending. I simply can't bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 10...",3,18,36,27 December 2006
