The Blair Witch Project," Two word review: Don't bother
","I thought 13th Floor was the worst thing I'd ever paid money for... no more. It was Oscar material compared to this dog.  It was boring *and* annoying. They should issue both Dramamine *and* NoDoze at the door. At one point a character said 'Mike, don't go to sleep' and I leaned over to one of the people I was watching it with and said, 'Audience, don't go to sleep'.  She nearly lost it. :-)  The 'nose-cam' scene nearly had us rolling in the aisles!  It went on so long that it started to look like the actor was talking *with* *her* *nose*!  I don't that that was the intended reaction. If we weren't already whispering 'Die already.' to each other, it wouldn't have been so irritating.It's a damn shame MST3K's been cancelled because I'd *love* to see them do this one. Maybe they'll come back for a special reunion show.Save your money.",1,0,2,1 August 1999
