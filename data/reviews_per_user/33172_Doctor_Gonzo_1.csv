Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Simply Amazing
","With all the hype about this movie, I can understand why so many people were dissapointed. Sure it would be fun to watch Jar Jar have his limbs ripped off so we do not have to endure another minute of stupid ethnic stereotypes in star wars. And for the people that say how much Jake Llyod sucks, think of every movie you have ever seen with a child actor in it, and realize ALL CHILD ACTORS CAN'T ACT! I thought the film was great it did everything it had to. Which was set up the plot for the second and third films, and introduce the characters. I only have a few gripes with the film...1- Darth Maul- I've heard that many think he was a better character than Darth Vader, and if i ever meet someone who thinks that I will rip them from the world. He had so much potential to be a decent character, but he is barely in the film and to make matters worse hes a jobber. If they kept him around and actually developed his character so he was actually menacing the film would have been 100 times better.2-special effects- The effects were so amazing I think it took away from the film, It seems Lucas was a little bit more in love with his shots than any of the characters. I give him the benifit of the doubt though since the final battle with Darth Maul is one of the best cut action sequences I have ever viddied. I didn't have much faith in him as a director before this since whenever he directs he always draws the film out too much. And thats the reason that Empire is by far the better of the films!3-Pod Racing- The most annoying character next to Jar Jar was the Pod Race announcer it ruins the scene for me completely!4-Anakin- I thought it was kind of a letdown how he destroyed the Trade Federations ship. destroying it by accident just seemed a bit stupid.
But aside from my few gripes I thought the movie was great, and well worth waiting for! And I can't wait for the next one especially since I hear Lucas is bringing its rating up to PG-13 so it should be alot darker in tone.",Null,0,0,7 January 2000
