Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Don't Try to Figure This Movie Out
","Never before has a movie that I issued a score of 8 stars to, left me with such a queasy feeling in my stomach. I do understand that this is a drama/comedy and that it was written for entertainment value, but I can't help but feel somewhat offended and manipulated by the inference that everyone in Kazakh is like Borat: Foul-mouthed, without morals and both ignorant and disrespectful of other cultures. Borat, himself, is a horrible, bloated stereo-type, but a funny one at times. There are times in the movie when he actually offers to help us think outside of the box, when we realize that we are almost as enculturated and dogmatic as he is. I was disgusted by the scene in the hotel room, and afterward, when they were running through the lobby naked. The sight of that fat man without clothing horrified me for days afterward, and I am trying hard not to think about it. Forever. Somehow, there is some value in this movie, in accepting others, but I feel this character was written as someone unrealistically vile. Please, whatever you do, do not equate nor associate the character Borat with the multitude of normal and good people in Kazakh. Watching this movie was like reading a copy of Hustler and listening to a Frank Zappa album at the same time. I still don't fully understand what I liked about it.",8,1,2,2 January 2019
The English Patient," An Exercise in Pointlessness
","I figured that with a title as pedestrian as The English Patient, it has to be good, right? First off, I thought I was in WWI, not WWII, because they were using bi-planes. The first plane is a Stearman, an American aircraft used only state-side in WWII, for training purposes. The proper plane to use, for two people, is the British Boulton-Paul Defiant, several of which are still flying. Later, a Dehavilland Tiger Moth (WWI-era) shows up. OK. Forget about the ill-chosen airplanes.There is a woman in the front (observer) seat of the Stearman when it is hit and downed by German anti-aircraft fire. Who was she? I don't recall anyone mentioning her. OK, forget about the unknown lady who burns to death.Speaking of burning to death, how did the pilot escape? If the fuel tank was in the front of the airplane, which it apparently was supposed-to-be (I'm not an expert on Stearmans), then he had about ten seconds, at 200 mph, before he is burned alive. Okay. He only suffered some burn to his face. The fire looked rather serious to me.Next, we have the nurse in the back of a truck, riding alongside a jeep containing her friendly, cheery nurse friend. Her wonderful friend (maybe the only person in the film who we actually like) promptly hits a land-mine and she dies. Why? What purpose does this serve? How is this carnage part of the plot?Why is the field hospital shelled (by the Germans?)? How does this contribute to our understanding of the story?Excited yet? Me neither. After her fellow-nurse friend is killed, she decides to basically desert her post and derelict her duties by taking the afore-mentioned, facially-burned pilot to a church that appears abandoned to her. She was wearing an army helmet (from WWI), so I assume she was an Army nurse. This is desertion. Honorable enough, if we are given a solid reason for her taking this risk and putting herself in such jeopardy for another individual human being. We are given no such reason.She finds a king-sized bed for him, as well as mosquito netting, food, water and fuel and supplies to cook with. Not bad, for a place on the front lines of battle.After that, this kooky guy shows up, (played by Willem DaFoe). Let me get this straight: He says he is in the same Canadian Military unit as some people who know her, he is just 'checking up' on her, and that he 'lives' nearby? He is also her neighbor in Montreal, Canada? Not very likely.Once he gets inside the church where the burned guy is, he proceeds to insult the guy who is recovering, questioning his identity. WTF?After the 'insult the handicapped guy' scene, we are brought to a somewhat elegant get-together, where (mostly British?) people in formal attire are chatting about their stocks and shares. This is when I turned the movie off. This movie could have excelled had it been done by a small budget, independent, foreign (Italian or French) film maker and a screen-writer who knows how to create compelling and meaningful dialogue. This way, it could have adhered to the plot and intention of the novel.",1,4,9,28 May 2014
Sleepy Hollow," Crazy, Gratuitous Violence
","I am being a little generous by giving this move 6 out of 10. An otherwise perfectly respectable performance by Jonny Depp is spoiled by.., everybody's head getting chopped off. All through the movie, one-by-one, all the townspeople have their heads chopped off. Maybe they know why it's happening, but the people watching the movie don't. Why should we want to see decapitation after meaningless decapitation? What, precisely, is '...a Hessian', anyway, and what has it got to do with the people of the town? Good literature has rich symbolism. What does a headless horseman mean, symbolically? I'll admit to not having read the book, but this movie is just more inane, gratuitous violence. I found the story neither rich nor comprehensible.",6,1,2,11 May 2014
Once," This Movie Is a Joke
","It's hard for me to not like a music-related movie, but this guy's songwriting and singing/playing ability was so lacking that it was hard to watch. I cringed every time he opened his mouth or took the guitar out of his git-bag.
There is no way that a woman who plays as well as she did would ever become interested in such talentless music. After the scene at the music instrument shop, when he stood there wide-eyed while she played, I was hoping that when she finished, he would beg her to make him a better musician.
Then, they walk into a record company with a cassette in a portable desktop unit and actually have the nerve to play it for the guy. Absolute rubbish.
There is no real chemistry between the two, no real romance or showings of affection. He did want to boink her, and I'll give him a half point for that, but he shot and missed.
The potential for so many good scenes were missed in this movie. As it is, the dialogue and screenplay are abysmal. I don't know who is a more talentless hack, the singer/guitarist or the producer of this movie.",3,0,5,18 November 2019
Forrest Gump," Over-rated and Pointless
","Probably the most over-rated movie of the 1990's. Who is Forrest Gump? What is inside his head.., or heart, for that matter? All we can establish is that he is unintelligent enough to make it in the army. Is he handicapped? Not? He is like an anti-person, whom everything happens to, instead of making things happen.., until he acquires inspiration and ambition out of the blue and goes on an impossible running tour. I have not been able to discern an actual point this movie is trying to make, nor establish just who this mentally-challenged millionaire really is. Maybe he appeals to so many people because they identify with him? That is a truly scary thought, but apparently, it seems to be the case. A pointless, stupid movie.A salute to powerlessness and vacuousness.",3,2,5,20 November 2014
Dirty Dancing," Dancing in Handcuffs
","You have to really try hard to get me to not like a movie whose main theme is dancing (especially, learning to dance). You have to really try hard to get me to not like a film with Patrick Swayze.., and/or Jennifer Grey in it. I liked Swayze in Donnie Darko, Roadhouse and Ghost. I liked Grey in F.B's Day Off and Wind.This film was not just mediocre in its dialogue, production and yes, it's dancing: It was actually obnoxious: (the ever-present, glowering, rich Jew who was the owner of the Jewish summer camp for Jewish families. Everything was askew in this film: Grey's embarrassingly-conventional garb, in contrast to the people she associated with, was hard to watch.Swayze's and Greys dancing was stiff, rehearsed and inexpressive. It was as though they knew the moves, but did not know how to express their lives through the dance. (A little smiling would have helped).The abortion reference and inclusion in the plot did not sit well with me. I did not find this entertaining, and when the young man said, 'I could hear her screaming in the hall.', I pressed eject. What I find particularly appalling about this abortion content is one line, issued by the Jewish 'father' of the child (the mother was gentile), in reference to the woman he impregnated: 'some people matter.., and some don't.'I could not help but think he may have meant gentiles (non-jews) in general. We see in Dirty Dancing how the other main gentile in the movie is cast as the 'bad boy'.What Dirty Dancing needed was a more dynamic character played by Jennifer Grey. She would have certainly been capable of it. If you are going to create tension: (a 30-something lady-killer with a younger woman), then bring it to a crescendo and 'burn down the house'. Complete the transformation of demure 'Baby' (sic) to the defiant and autonomous Frances.Swayze needed to have a life outside of dancing, perhaps taking on the restrictive (and possibly elitist) management of the resort. We needed to see a 'barn-burner' in Dirty Dancing with hotter, more expressive dancing and a much-greater development of the main characters' identities. Grey's character needed to complete and fulfill her transformation. Swayze needed to interact more forcefully and cleverly with his antagonists.Swayze's original partner, played by Cynthia Rhodes, may have been much-better played by fire-brand Demi Moore, his later beloved in Ghost. A professional salsa/meringue/ dancer may have been even better, because the acting was not especially difficult. Moore would have rectified this role.I object strongly to abortion being tossed into a picture to liven-up what is a still-dreary-and-now-morose film. It is cheap.., and it is disrespectful. I would have given a '5' to Dirty Dancing, appreciating some of the difficulties the couple went through and because of the fairly-good acting by Swayze and Grey, but the tactless inclusion of abortion (as excitement) caused me to detract one star. Choose life. Stand and fight.The full-fledged transformation we need from Dirty Dancing never happens, and we are left wondering who these people really are. Watch Bootmen, Center Stage, Flashdance or Shall We Dance, instead: Much-better movies.",4,2,7,12 July 2015
Good Will Hunting," Healthy Cynicism
","This movie makes a strong statement for individuality and stepping outside of the system. The brilliance of Damon's character (Will Hunting), lies not in his mathematical genius, but in his ability to assess social structures, schemes and systems. His cynicism is an effective shield against those who would use his talents for their own personal gain. Robin Williams' character is very believable as a therapist, because while he does not necessarily support Hunting becoming part of the corporate (or government) money machine, he does express the value in using one's abilities to one's utmost.the movie could have benefited from an exploration of Hunting's past (where he came from and what made him what he is), as well as some time spent in understanding what his inner thoughts and feelings are. Maybe the scene with Ben Affleck acting as Hunting's agent could have been scrapped, to fit in more character development for Hunting. Again, this movie makes an important statement about how the amoral, cookie-cutter world of business has affected us all and therefore, why some revile and avoid it.This is a warning to the society we have built: Integrate those who are dis-affected, and create a world of greater humanity or we will all suffer the loss of ourselves.",7,1,4,15 May 2014
School of Rock," Uneven but Humorous
","This is a thoroughly-enjoyable romp that helps us to see that our individual talents and self-esteem are sometimes bolstered in unusual, or even very unusual, ways. The most humorous parts of this movie are the scenes which show both the skepticism and approval with which the students see their new teacher and his 'curriculum'.'You are a fat loser.., and you have body odor!' one student rebels. Another states adamantly, 'You're a joke! You're the worst teacher I've ever had.'Dewey Finn's plan to get these children to think for themselves and kick up their heels at authority works perfectly: Their latent talents and identities increase and improve as this most-ulikely-of-mentors utilizes their skills for his own selfish-though-understandable reason.Although we never do find out why Dewey wasn't arrested at the school meeting, nor where the 'soundproofing' that supposedly was put on the classroom walls went, we can forgive all this because of the movie's big heart. Jack Black carried off the madman/genius/slacker/overachiever as few could. The School of Rock, though somewhat uneven, even ungainly, is a humorous look at 'what if'.The odd sequence at the end where we hear an AC/DC vamp being repeated ad-infinitum, appears to be a studio outtake, and is one of the weakest endings to a movie (by far) that I have awarded an '8' to that I have ever seen. The time and film should have been spent, instead, in showing a scene where Dewey's best friend, Ned, finally stands up to his controlling girlfriend, and perhaps the children assert themselves to their parents.Of course, it wouldn't have hurt to have informed us how Dewey avoided charges of fraud, contributing to the delinquency of a minor (20 counts) and forgery (on job application).We'd also like to know how the experience has changed Ross, the Principal. The movie deserves a better ending, and although I am tempted to detract one star because of it, I will not. One scene that I hated was when Dewey went behind the Palace to fetch Zach. It was totally out-of-character when Dewey treated Zach like a dictator, and went all 'high-and-mighty' on the members of the band that were playing cards with Zach. This scene lent to the unevenness of the movie.Although I consider Orange County to be an overall better movie, School of Rock is unforgettable and one-for-the-books.",8,0,0,5 January 2015
Moulin Rouge!," An Acid Trip While Having the Flu
","This movie is one of only two that I hate most. I love musicals. That is why I hate Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge is emblematic of everything in modern culture that is flashy, maybe even entrancing on the outside, and empty and meaningless. I think what I hate most about this movie is its pretentiousness. Changing form masquerades as substance. This movie is a caricature of modern life and the worldview of those who are brain-dead materialists. If you want to get my attention and keep it, you better have 1.) heart and 2.) brains. Moulin Rouge has neither. I would not call Moulin rouge a musical. I would consider it an attempt at extreme exaggeration by someone knowledgeable in conformity, illusion and hypnosis. In that sense, it may be an important movie, psychologically and sociologically.",1,4,7,21 August 2014
The Red Violin," The Reduced Violin
","The Red Violin is a random series of events that are not connected in any way, shape or form. I understand the fact that European films often have no point and are usually just 'slice of life', but this film is even worse. It tells us nothing of the construction of the violin and very little about what it was intended for.
A hole in the plot is that the violin was intended for the creator's 'son', but we never learn whether his newborn is male of female. What happened to his dream of giving it to his 'son'? How did it end up in a monastery? Why was the violin 'red'?
The whole movie just doesn't add up, but I was willing to bear with it because of the marvelous solo violin playing supplied by Joshua Bell.
Then, came an impasse. The Chinese lady who tried to hide and save the instrument from the cultural revolution had her door kicked in by storm-troopers? I can not forgive the screen-writer this travesty. This kind of cruelty was unnecessary in this film and I ejected the movie and threw it in the trash because of this. Why do they think that seeing a pure heart betrayed is entertaining? I will not accept such darkness in my art. Is there any reason why we couldn't have been shown a happy segment involving Chinese people in China?
With no plot, no point and no kindness, this film is a joke.",3,0,0,16 November 2018
A Beautiful Mind," The Cocky Dweeb
","I really don't see how anyone can like this movie. What kind of person would that be? I am really trying to put this equation together. My only guess is a misanthropic, rude, conceited rich boy. I suppose this kind of person might find some vicarious validation or confirmation of his (or her) clinically anti-social behavior. Then again, many misanthropic, rude, conceited rich boys would find this movie as value-less as I did. The only poetry in the movie came when the lady at the bar gave him a righteous dope-slap. His colleagues should have done the same thing. This guy makes Rainman (Dustin Hoffmann), Starman (Jeff Bridges) and Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) seem relatively normal and affable. What I would love is for a sequel: (John Nash Meets Mr. Bean). Bean would eat him alive with his equally dysfunctional yet eminently- approachable eccentricism. I can only imagine the tears Nash would weep and the teeth he would gnash as his rigid worldview and egotism is shattered by the bumbling-but-caring and well-meaning Bean.I went along with the movie, continuing to watch, just to wait for the moment when this cretin is expelled from college. Alas, that moment never came. Sometimes, things just don't add up: Ask Nash.This arrogant, ill-mannered nebulus would never have made it through high school with his attitude. I abode with his cockiness, though, until it was revealed that the big theory he was working on was (cough) economics. I really thought the screenwriter was screwing with us at that point: Economics? Is there anyone in their right mind who finds economic theory to be entertaining or otherwise compelling?One major flaw in the script was when his roommate pushes Nash's desk and all his paperwork out the window: He should have shoved Nash out with it.His working on the sterile and uninspiring subject of economics was the icing on the cake. The cherry on top came when he began work for our beloved (choke) Pentagon. more formulaic demonization of Russia.If we find it difficult to find empathy or any relation to John Nash, the person, we find it impossible to find any connection to John Nash the D.O.D. employee. Not in today's political climate, knowing what we do about the Pentagon, C.I.A. etc.John Nash was looking for a novel idea to distinguish and validate him. Try a little humility and some compassion, John.P.S: Do NOT blame this horrid movie on Ron Howard. The short-comings of this film are the direct responsibility of screenwriter Akiva Goldsman.., and the seven other producers, besides Howard, that he had to satisfy. I'm not sure he could have made this film any better from a direction standpoint.",5,1,5,8 August 2014
When Harry Met Sally...," A Sad Statement on Relationship
","I thought this movie was terrible. I watched it once, many years ago, on cable, but this time, I only lasted up until the scene where they were walking in the park and she evidently was allowing him to become a part of her life. There was no character development in the movie. Who are these two people? What are their dreams, their history? Why are they together? It seems that neither of them have any solid identity. Maybe that is their greatest commonality.I did get the impression that Sally was somewhat enthusiastic about life. What, in the world, did she see in him? I was trying to look at Harry psychologically, but could not come up with any specific pathology, but some warped blend of anhedonia and delusions of grandeur. Crystal sounding like he is reading all his lines does not help things, and this gives the movie a droning tempo. The fact that his character expects his assuming, pompous and otherwise rude nature to earn him friends and lovers is bad enough: When relatively-normal but easily-influenced Sally started actually accepting Harry's depressive confrontationalism, I could see where the movie was heading. I loved Billy Crystal in City Slickers and Meg Ryan was great in Addicted To Love, but When Harry Met Sally reminded me of The Mirror Has Two Faces, in that it inadvertently explores the issue of women 'settling for less' in a relationship and allowing themselves to be there-by abused. I am frankly offended by When Harry Met Sally, and can only imagine how the movie would have run if Meg Ryan's character had stood her ground and demanded more: More than Harry, as well as the putz she was with at the airport.",4,2,5,30 April 2014
The Green Mile," Another Eruption from Stephen King's Evil Soul
","This is a dark, mean-spirited movie masquerading as something inspirational. Most of the movie takes place in and amongst the death row cells, inmates and guards. The violence is over-the-top, as per usual in any Stephen King product. Usually, when he writes something, any goodness and light in the movie are just props for the evil, which we are slyly manipulated to swallow.Case-in-point: Michael Clark Duncan's character: An innocent man with healing ability accused of child murder. Only Stephen King would think of that: He is the master of justifying evil, criminal behavior. Another example of the sleight-of-hand involved in the screenplay is the casting of Tom Hanks, who usually plays the good guy. In this movie, he chooses to look the other way as innocent men are tortured and murdered by a state penal machine.We all need to think long and hard about what our values are. Our choices in entertainment reflect the kind of family we came from; how we were raised. Moreover, we need to be vigilant of sly artists who have a talent for deception: Capital punishment is murder. Including a hands-on healer was a cheap tactic to get good, moral people to watch the movie or buy the book. Stephen King is a sick man and we need to see clearly.",5,1,5,14 August 2014
The Terminal," Major Hole In Plot
","I can not ignore major, obvious holes in a movie's plot, especially when they effect the rest of the movie. These two questions will summarize my complaint: 1.) Why why were the I.C.E. agents talking to Navorsky when they knew he could not understand English? and most importantly, 2.) How did he know to stay in the airport terminal when he could not understand English?The director (Spielberg) did not care enough about The Terminal to patch these holes. I think it's ridiculous to waste movie-goers' time. Besides this major complaint, I also found Hank's character dull and un-compelling. I am not knowledgeable in affairs of immigration and customs, but I find it difficult to believe that I.C.E would create such an uncontrolled situation by releasing this man into the terminal without employing an interpreter to inform him of his situation. It's too bad, because with an intelligent script re-write, we could have had something special.",3,1,4,13 January 2015
Iron Man," Your Money will Not Protect You
","This film is just more formulaic propaganda of the type that seeks to demonize cultures other than industrialized (especially Arab or Persian), and which tries to pound into our heads, over-and-over, that the rich (in this case, Stark) are our friends.
I can not ignore nor accept this attempt at political/psychological manipulation, and contend that it is the rich (like Stark) who we need to protect ourselves from. The insinuation that money, and what money can afford, will protect the rich from those who do not value riches leaves me with a great deal of suspicion, and it is not hard to determine the cultural genesis of those who inspire and support movies like this. Inexcusable and transparent.",Null,0,2,19 March 2019
Speed," A Decent Action Movie
","Forget the fact that 111 drivers and passengers were killed by the bus on the streets and highways of Los Angeles: They did manage to save 16 of the 17 passengers. Forget the fact that most of the time, they are obviously not driving 50 or above. Forget about the fact that the bus would not have made the jump. Forget the fact that we do not know if any people were on board the aircraft that the bus hit at the end. Maybe there were 200: I don't know, because the great kiss scene at the end admittedly grabbed my attention.Forget about the fact that Dennis Hopper (as Howard Payne) would have checked the bag of money as soon as he had collected it from the trash barrel, and that the marking dye would have exploded there.., not later, on the subway. forget about the fact that no marking dye would have been put in the bag, because the police would have realized that it would have triggered Payne to destroy the bus. Despite these maybe-forgivable unlikelihoods, this is a good action movie that kept my interest for the entire time, by use of various twists and turns in the plot, and by engendering concern and empathy for the characters. We honestly like the people on the bus, including Sandra Bullock (Annie), Keaneau Reeves (Jack) and Alan Ruck (Stephens). Jeff Daniels plays a very likable SWAT member, and Dennis Hopper plays the fully-functional madman so well, that alone is scary.The difficulty of the direction, stunts, and production of this movie must have been one incredible challenge after another. The elevator scene at the beginning of the movie is very exciting and well-done, and sets the tone for the movie.Inherent in Speed is the metaphor that society is 'running on the red line' at all times, with an inability to slow itself down, and a fear that if it does, it will self-destruct. It will take a combination of us all pulling together at maximum effort, and a miracle, for us to finally get off the 'hamster wheel' before the overlords realize what has happened. In kind of a cheesy way, this movie is a testament to how much good, or bad, one person can do. I hope the City of Los Angeles promptly compensated everyone for their damage and losses.",7,0,0,29 May 2014
The Truman Show," Symbolic of an Amoral Society
","This is my most hated movie. it is the most offensive movie I have ever watched, and it is not only the movie, itself that I find offensive: It is also the huge, positive, popular reaction to it. You should all be ashamed of yourselves and perhaps re-evaluate yourselves to see if you actually HAVE any values. Let me get this straight: A human being (human life still matters to some), is trapped at birth (illegally detained, which is the legal equivalent of kidnapping) in an immense, dome-like structure and introduced to a cast of characters who play the part of his family, friends, etc. None of it is real, and it is all broadcast on TV, which is hugely-popular.I am trying not to become angry as I write this. This movie reveals a hidden danger in the human subconscious and all of you who approve of it are latent, misanthropic psychopaths.Let me ask you a rhetorical question: 'How far will you go for entertainment?' Will you trap a small child in the cage of your fancy and decoration? Tell me: Which country would allow this? Which country with a shred of decency left?! (I am not talking about the governments. I am talking about the people. I'm talking about you. If you would do this to a human being, or even admire its depiction in art, and I knew you, I would keep a very close eye on you. You people disgust me.",1,8,46,21 August 2014
Thirteen Days," Pure Propaganda...Bad Direction
","There are two major aspects of this movie that I reviled: 1.) It is pure propaganda, just for the sake of creating 'good guys and bad guys'. I am surprised that Hollywood, in the year 2000, produced such a re-visitation of a 1950's way of thinking. The movie did not, for one second, admit that the U.S. had medium range nuclear missiles in W. Germany, aimed at Russia and had a similar strike time reaction-window as that which had the U.S. government tearing their hair out and running around like sissies. How do we think the Russians must have felt?! Now, today, the U.S. missiles are in Poland... 500 miles closer to Russia!! This movie is so one-sided that I would have thought it was manufactured by the Department of Defense or the U.S. Marines. It is abyssymal and inexcuseable. The second facet of Thirteen Days that I found unacceptable (and made it unwatchable, for me)was Kevin Costner's crazy, warped, overdone accent. Now, I was born and raised in Boston. I spent the first 50 years of my life there, beginning in 1957. I have never hear anyone speak like Costner did in this picture. It is as though he was trying to do 'President Kennedy times two'. If I were the person playing JFK in the picture, I would have turned to Kostner at one point and said, 'Why are you talking like that? Are you trying to mock me?' Evidentally, Kostner figured he was the star of the movie and did everything he could to attract attention to himself. honestly, his 'accent' is the biggest direction gaffe I have ever seen in a movie. It was just insane.",2,5,12,2 September 2015
