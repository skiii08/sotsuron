The Ring," Disturbing, yet vague
","****POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT****While I found this film to have a few disturbing images (i.e. the fact that Samara'a victims all looked as though they had died alone and forgotten in a well), there was simply too much disjointed symbolism to satisfy me, the best examples of such being Samara's sudden manifestation with the Morgans, Aiden's seeming powers of clairvoyance/precognition, and why Anna Morgan went mad to begin with. The film hinted, of course, that Samara was responsible for all of the madness, after all, if she can make pictures appear on x-ray film, then why couldn't she have driven her mother to madness? As an intelligent adult, I don't feel the need to be spoon-fed every little detail, however, I left the theatre with the distinct impression that I wasn't seeing the bigger picture. I am more interesed in obtaining a close translation of the novel (being a firm believer that no matter how good the movie, the book is always richer), than I am in seeing Ringu, the Japanese predecessor.Of course it is entirely possible that I missed some of the crucial clues as a result of the overwhelming numbers of teenyboppers that filled the theatre. Not only did I have to deal with juevinille shrieks every time the scene changed, but then there would be a good 5 minute discussion about 'Omigod! I am like soooo freaked out!' afterward. My friends and I all agreed that it should have received an R rating, if only to keep the 14 year olds out.At the end of the movie, I admit to being more than a little haunted by the imagery (Samara climbing out of the well at the end of the tape right before Noah bites it is a chilling image), but I just can't help feeling that there were too many loose-ends and not a strong enough plot to induce me to spend any more money trying to figure them out.",Null,0,0,4 November 2002
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Order of the Plot-Holes
","For those of you looking for a faithful adaptation of Order of the Phoenix, this film isn't it. How director David Yates got the go to direct completely baffles me. Not since Chris Columbus' stilted pacing has a HP film disappointed me. I realize that in a book as rich in detail as the HP series something is bound to be left out in the film version, but the direction and editing of this film leave much to be desired.The film opens in Little Whinging with the dementor attack on Harry and Dudley. Mrs. Figg happens across the boys as if by accident just after Harry defeats the Dementors with his Patronus, but is never 'outed' as a squib. The Dursleys were more worried than horrified, and never threatened Harry with expulsion from their house. The sheer vileness that audiences last saw in Prisoner of Azkaban was notable absent, leaving the view to wonder what happened to bring us the weak and whimpering version of the Dursleys that appears in this film.When Harry is brought to the Order's headquarters, very little is made of the fact that the Noble House of Black was once a bastion of pure-blood fanaticism. Kreature makes a very weak appearance, and the simple existence of Regulus Black (R.A.B.?) was never even touched upon.Fred and George remain the comic relief, but the ever developing character of Ginny Weasley is ignored. Even more upsetting was the notable absence of Mrs. Weasly's growing concern for her family's safety. I thought that one of the most touching moments in the book was the chapter in which Mrs. Weasly attempts of banish the boggart only to have it continually morph into the horrifying visages of various dead loved ones. Bill and Charlie were also not mentioned, leaving the viewer to wonder if the film franchise plans to reduce the Weasly family from 9 to 7.As excited as I was with the casting of Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, I felt that Yate simply did not do her justice. Yes she was vile, but not in the bureaucratic evil way Rowling depicted her in the novel. She simpered, but I just did not get the feeling that she took malicious pleasure that she should have in what she did as the High Inquisitor.The rumored St. Mungo's scene, while it may have been filmed, was disappointingly absent, with the film jumping from Mr. Weasly's attack in the ministry (although why he was in the Deapartment of Mysteries was never addressed) to Christmas dinner at the HQ and a lame 'Here's Daddy!' from Mrs. Weasly.Even more disappointing was the depiction of the Department of Mysteries. I entered the movie hoping for some wicked effects and bizarre magical elements, and was left with just the Hall of Prophesies and the mysterious doorway. To add insult to injury, the relationship between Sirius and Harry was never developed to the point where Harry would naturally feel devastated by the loss of his godfather. I felt as though their relationship was more vague friend of the family then Harry beginning to look to Sirius as a surrogate father figure.Over all the continuity of the film felt too rushed and disjointed, as opposed to the more fluid Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of fire. Relationships between the characters felt forced, which I found odd, considering the fact that the cast has been working together for 7 years or so. If any of my personal suspicions and predictions for the future of Harry are accurate, this film has left out numerous key elements. That being the case, then films 6 and 7 will have to scramble to make up for what this film lacks. As Yates is slated to direct the next installment, I can only look to it with a feeling of dread, wondering how he will mangle the Half-Blood Prince.",4,143,203,12 July 2007
