The Blair Witch Project," A uniquely done classic!
","When my wife first approached me with the idea of going to see a film called 'The Blair Witch Project',my immediate thought was,'The Blair what???'.I heard nothing of this movie,no advertisements or anything,prior to going to the theater,so naturally I was skeptical.Normally,when I have a premonition that a film is going to be horribly bad,9 times out of 10,it turns out to be right.This time,however,I was pleasantly surprised. What we have here is a very uniquely done classic horror film that I think we can safely place in the same ranks as 'Night of the Living Dead'(the original '68 classic).Just look at the similarities;Both were very cheaply done with a practically unknown cast.Most of the people I have spoken with about this movie either love it a lot,or hate it a lot,but one thing I look for in a good movie is uniqueness,and this movie definitely has it. Most of the people who like this movie are probably under the age of 20,but this is one 36 year old who loves 'The Blair Witch Project' enough to have it in his video collection.",7,3,6,26 September 2001
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Not as exciting,but still good.
","I normally avoid sequels due to the fact that I have been let down by so many bad sequels to good films.Due to the fact that I liked National Treasure so much,weakness kicked in and I just had to see what these characters are up to now.I didn't get my hopes up that this film would measure up to the original in any way,and that turned out to be a smart thing.This adventure wasn't quite as exciting,but it it was still entertaining nonetheless.I enjoyed seeing the new characters in a new adventure,and I also enjoyed the new additions in Ed Harris and Helen Mirren.I enjoyed the touch of realism added to Ben and Abigail's relationship.It reminds us that there are bumps in the road that is real life.It's a worthwhile watch.",7,0,0,3 December 2008
Vertigo," A clever mystery in the hands of the master.
","The natural ability of James Stewart to play dramatic roles as well as comedic with the greatest of ease made him fit perfectly in the world of Alfred Hitchcock.It's why he was used by Hitch multiple times,and the two of them working together never failed to disappoint.This is a very clever story and and no one was better at telling this type of story than Alfred Hitchcock.A great supporting cast surrounds Stewart,and the cinematography and special effects are top notch for their day.I wasn't around when this film came about but I would be willing to bet any amount of money that it looked great on the big screen.If only I could go back in time.Great film!",9,1,2,29 August 2010
Walk the Line," A credible telling of the story of a fascinating figure.
","The story of Johnny and June Cash is one that is worthy of a big screen presentation.Johnny's early life alone makes an interesting story,as does his his life with the angel who saved him from certain death,June Carter.It is in my humble opinion that his life would have been much shorter without her.Their love for each other was perhaps the truest of any romances that have ever been made public.Though Joaquin Phoenix looks little like Cash,and Reese Witherspoon even less like June Carter,the two actors did a credible job in capturing the public persona of the duo.though I enjoy this film,I do wish it would have gone further into their lives,such as the subject of Nashville virtually turning their back on a man who did more than his share in helping the town earn it's nickname,'Music City'.In the end,his earlier life by itself,makes a good Hollywood script.This is a credible telling of a much storied life.",9,0,1,16 July 2006
The Monuments Men," Monumentally dull!
","It was a slow week for movies.The wife and I usually zero in pretty quickly on what we want to see at the theater,but this particular week,it was a tad more difficult.Nothing really struck our fancy.Finally,we decided on this film with all of it's big names,even though the plot wasn't attractive.It's always a pleasure to watch Clooney,Damon,and Bill Murray work,and they brought a lot to their characters here,but the plot just didn't work for me,and it was agonizingly long to boot.As expensive as going to the theater is these days,I would have gladly waited and viewed this film on cable later.Lesson learned.If we ever have another night of selection difficulty at the movie theater,we may just go bowling next time.",5,1,2,19 March 2014
Captain Phillips," Hanks' best work in quite a while.
","Tom Hanks is one of those actors that I am always on the lookout for what they are doing next,and are seldom disappointed by.Hanks has had a ten year plus dry spell when it comes to my taste.Not since Cast Away has he offered me something that I would consider owning.Finally,Captain Phillips has hit the target.This is Tom's best work in quite a while.The film is a very engrossing display of intense acting by Hanks and his supporting cast.First time actor Barkhad Abdi delivers what is among the most impressive first time acting performances that I have ever witnessed.Well worth the rental,and well worth a spot on the DVD shelf.",8,0,1,24 February 2014
The Sound of Music," Simply great!
","I was but a wee little lad when seeing this film on television for the first time.I walked away with a bit of a crush on Julie Andrews,as I suppose most young boys did.This film came along at a time when musicals were beginning to fade out in Hollywood,yet ironically it turned into one of the best films ever made in the genre.Everything about this film is about as close to perfection as you can get in a movie.The cast and the music were excellent,and the cinematography is among the best I have ever seen in a film.The Von Trapp family and I go way back,and for as long as I live and breathe,I will visit them again,and often.",10,1,7,30 June 2011
The Longest Yard," It just doesn't have the swagger.
","If this were a story that I were not familiar with,I would go ahead and say that this was another 'ok' Adam Sandler film.However,since I am familiar with it,I cannot help but make the comparison to the 1974 classic.It is a matter of which film does a better job of telling the story.I hate to say it,but it isn't this one.When we think of the character of Paul Crewe,we think of the swagger of Burt Reynolds,not the goofiness of Adam Sandler.Chris Rock's Caretaker is in no way comparable to Jim Hampton's portrayal.I mean,Jim Hampton had a way of making us care about the guy.With Rock,you just didn't care as much when the man dies.Also,the story seems to be pushed along a little too quickly here,whereas the original graciously took it's time building up to the exciting finale,which wasn't as exciting here because we know what's coming.I gave this film every chance in the world to be at least comparable to the original,if not better that the original.It did not succeed,and even the presence of original stars Burt Reynolds and Ed Lauter did nothing to help it.A note to Hollywood:The notion that every classic film of old needs to be updated and modernized is thoroughly ridiculous.Leave the old classics alone and just let them be respected for the time period in which they were made.Enough already!",1,13,27,23 December 2005
Skyfall," Craig's best turn as Bond,so far.
","When viewing a James Bond film,one of the first things I ask myself as it rolls along is,'How good is the theme song?'.Adele's theme to this film is the best Bond theme that I have heard this side of Duran Duran's A View to a Kill.With that out of the way,the film does not disappoint.Daniel Craig,while he has never been a favorite in the Bond role,gives his best work as the character in this film.It has been years since I have found a James Bond film this compelling,and it is definitely my favorite among Craig's Bond pictures.Javier Bardem as the villain,though impressive enough,doesn't even come close among memorable Bond foes.Overall,it's worth the price paid.",8,1,5,29 November 2013
50 First Dates," Special only for the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore
","This film is typical Adam Sandler fare,with Sandler playing the usual type of character that we expect to see.It's the usual juvenilistic, sophomoric Adam Sandler in action.I must admit there are a few of his films(but certainly not all) that I consider guilty pleasures.This one falls into that category for one reason only:The great chemistry between Sandler and Drew Barrymore.They worked so well together previously,that you naturally expect the same here.In that regard,you will not be disappointed.It's not as good as their previous outing together,but it's great seeing them together on screen nonetheless.The story does have a little sweetness to it,but overall,it's nothing special.",7,2,6,28 August 2004
Ghost," Ghosts don't always have to be scary
","It's a ghost story,love story,and good vs. evil story.This movie connects on every level.It makes you laugh,cry,and puts you on the edge of your seat.There is excellence on every level,here, including casting,story,and special effects.Thumbs up to Whoopi Goldberg for her well deserved Oscar.This movie is proof that a ghost does not always have to be scary.They can be warm and funny,too.Really,the only thing you can question about this film is their perception of the afterlife,but who among us really knows how that goes?They may have gotten it right,for all we know.Ghost is thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable.",8,4,7,9 October 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Much better the second time around.
","I am not sure what made me wait ten years to watch this film for the first time,but this is exactly what happened.I regret to say that I did not connect with it at all and did not bother with the two sequels.Now since then I have learned that there are many factors that play into whether or not you enjoy a particular viewing of a film,so it became another in a long list of films that needed a second chance.Having given it that second chance viewing,I can honestly say that it was much better the second time around.However,I have now also viewed the two sequels and I have to say that I found The second film,The Temple of Doom,to be much more exciting and entertaining,but nonetheless,I enjoyed all three films immensely.Unfortunately,I never got to see them on the big screen,where they probably looked even more awesome.It took Steven Spielberg,who obviously has an appreciation for cinematic history,to make these films as good as they were,not to mention the perfect casting of young Harrison Ford in the lead role.My ultimate suggestion is to rent all three and make a weekend film festival out of it.You won't be disappointed.",8,0,1,14 July 2008
Spartacus," What more noble cause than freedom?
","No man should be a slave,and there is no more noble cause to fight for than freedom.This very idea alone should intrigue potential viewers to watch this epic.This is a very engrossing film from start to finish,with Kirk Douglas valiantly leading the way,but what I find most interesting about Spartacus is director Stanley Kubrick's penchant for pushing the envelope as far as he could when it came to what was allowable in films at the time in terms of violence and sexuality,those familiar with Kubrick's later films know that he would go on from pushing that envelope to bursting it wide open as Hollywood gradually became more liberal with it's approach.That being said,Kubrick's Spartacus is riveting storytelling that will keep you engrossed.",8,0,0,3 July 2011
United 93," You will be moved.It is guaranteed.
","Unless you have been living in a cave or underground with absolutely no media sources at your disposal for the last five years,you know this story.You know what happened.You also know that there is no happy ending here.There is no Harrison Ford or Bruce Willis in the wings to wait for the right time to save the day.In fact,the actors in this film are not well known superstars.They are good representatives of the every day faces that were the victims of 911.While watching this film,I found myself reliving the day,only this time,from the perspective of the victims,and the feelings that I had five years ago were multiplied by a thousand.I challenge one and all to watch this film.I guarantee that if you have at the very least,an ounce of humanity,you will be moved.",9,1,3,10 September 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Timeless
","Friendship is an ageless,timeless subject.The appeal of E.T. and the reason it has never lost appeal is it's unique approach to that subject.We have a space alien.Not the kind that is seeking to control,dominate,or destroy the world,but a tender caring soul.His appearance is somewhat freakish to the first human he encounters,young Elliot,who no doubt is just as freakish in return to the alien.The film then becomes a somewhat comical yet tender 'getting to know you' type of story.Also comical are the efforts of young Elliot and his siblings to keep E.T. hid from view from Mom and all others.The film is a timeless treasure easily placed with the Wizard of Oz,among others.",8,1,2,12 August 2013
Casablanca," The movie that has everything.
","I'm not sure I can say anything about this film that hasn't been said already.It has romance.It has heartbreak.It has intrigue.It has thrills.It has a chuckle or two.It has great music.It has the undeniably overpowering screen presence of Humphrey Bogart.It has the strikingly beautiful Ingrid Bergman.It has the charm of Claude Rains. It has the often imitated,but never duplicated Peter Lorre.It has amazing support from Paul Henreid,Conrad Veidt,and Sydney Greenstreet, among others.It has flawless dialog.It has excellent direction from Michael Curtiz.It has a perfect score from the legendary Max Steiner. To sum it up,it has it all.Enough said.",9,0,3,17 January 2006
Chinatown," A very unique turn on the film noir genre.
","Here is a classic film noir that turns it's back on all the clichés we have come to associate with the genre.We have J.J. Gittes,played by Jack Nicholson,a California gumshoe investigating an adultery case,who inadvertently stumbles on to something bigger involving murder,and believe it or not,water.The film's ending is unfortunately not a happy one,as you will see.I like this film because it dared to break free of everything we come to expect of a particular genre,and the acting was nothing short of great,with Nicholson,Faye Dunaway,John Huston(who could be just as brilliant in front of the camera as he was behind it),even the cameo appearance of the film's director,Roman Polanski,is memorable.Great stuff.",8,0,2,15 November 2006
Gravity," Intense!
","There are many elements that are a good starting point for suspense.One of those is most certainly a complete lack of gravity.When you find yourself in the realm of outer space and a freak accident leaves you without a ship to which to return,you have a tense situation.This is a very creative idea for a story and it was carried out very well.Rather than being on 'the edge of your seat' as the old cliché goes,you will instead be clamoring for something to hold onto as you witness Bullock and Clooney in their struggle to keep from drifting into the nothingness of deep space.I would gladly revisit this film in the future and perhaps there is a spot for on the ole DVD shelf.",8,2,4,27 April 2014
To Be or Not to Be," Great timely satire.
","We needed laughs in 1942.What better thing to laugh at than the thing that was causing us the most tension at the time,World War II? The production of this film came at a very contentious time,and it paid off.The finished product is one to behold if you like to laugh.While the content being satirized may be dated,the humor is timeless.The only downer,I suppose,at the time was the loss of the film's star,Carole Lombard in a plane crash in January of 1942,well before the film's release.This no doubt put a damper on the film's humor for the audiences of the time,so it had to recover from this setback over time.That it has,and it is a must see comedy classic.",8,1,3,13 June 2014
Citizen Kane," Visually stunning masterpiece!
","It's generally regarded by those qualified to judge greatness in cinema that this is the one at the very pinnacle.The very top of the heap.The BEST movie in the history of cinema.My take? I will give it credit for being a great film.It is unique from all other films from it's time period.It not only tells us a captivating story,it is visually mesmerizing to boot.At the same time,is it my favorite film? No,that title goes elsewhere for me.There is a difference between large groups of experts determining what is great in cinema,and individual taste.I will buy what the grouped together experts say.On the grand scale,this is probably the best film ever made.My personal favorite film probably wouldn't come close in the eyes of those experts,but I wouldn't trade it.All that being said,may I say,nicely done Mr. Welles.Nicely done.",8,1,2,31 December 2013
Monster," Great acting.Objectionable content.
","I knew before viewing this film that I would find the majority of the content objectionable,so I was not surprised in that regard.What drew me to the film was the obvious pouring of heart and soul by Charlize Theron into this project that was evident in previews and interviews.Theron's portrayal of this tortured soul is nothing short of dead on.It is worth viewing for this fact alone.Theron was so immersed in character that she is purely non recognizable.You almost forget that this isn't the real Aileen Wuornos you are seeing.Though Theron might have been able to carry the film on her own,she is offered great support by Christina Ricci and the always credible Bruce Dern.It's a good film,not so much through content,but through the performance of the cast.",7,1,3,15 February 2005
The Birth of a Nation," Blatantly racist overtones in story and production overshadow potential high marks of all other aspects.
","It's clear that D.W. Griffith had honorable intentions with this film,wanting to give an accurate portrayal of Civil War and Reconstruction era America.This is evidenced in the film's length.A film of this length was not only a rarity at the time,it continues to be.To have worked this hard on a film and have it that heavily criticized must have been hard for him,and I am sympathetic to that,but at the same time,you can't really defend the blatantly racist overtones that the movie possesses,not only in story,but in production (white actors in black face depicting African Americans as uneducated buffoons,etc).All other aspects of the film can be given high marks if can bring yourself to ignore the above mentioned negativity,but good luck with that.",7,0,2,10 June 2012
This Is the End," A good idea gone to waste.
","The idea seemed like a good one.A group of current Hollywood A listers playing fictionalized versions of themselves in a fictionalized idea of how the world will end.The basic idea is funny.What is presented to us on film is not.What we have here is a vile,tasteless,vulgar,sacrilegious piece of garbage of a movie.The language in this atrocity alone made me sick to my stomach.That seldom happens to me.You blew it,guys.You took what was a hysterical idea that could have potentially been labeled a classic sometime in the future,and turned into something I wouldn't contaminate my garbage with.I went in wanting to like it,and came out wishing I hadn't wasted the rental.",1,18,37,20 December 2013
Mississippi Burning," Well executed,gripping story.
","This film is a good,though not flawless representative of the turbulent 1960's south.The character representation is good,though taken to a bit of an extreme in places.Gene Hackman gives another knockout performance here,as he does always as does Willem Dafoe.The cast is great,though Gailard Sartain was a surprising choice as Sheriff Stuckey, given his penchant for appearing in the worst of films.It is based on a true story,and as we all know,true stories are never presented to perfection.It is,however,presented as well as it can be.This is a very gripping,edge of your seat film,and very well done.",8,40,54,14 July 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A resounding live action comeback for Disney.
","Since Walt Disney's death,the Disney company has continued to produce films that can be considered classic,but the majority of those films are animated and you know what they are.As far as their live action films,there has been a steady decline in quality over the last thirty years.In Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl,we have what we can safely call a resounding comeback for the Disney company in the live action department.it is a virtual retelling of a classic Disney story,but it is nonetheless appealing.Johnny Depp exudes an inescapable charm as Captain Jack Sparrow,and a lot has to do with him shaping the character after a certain Rolling Stone band member.The remaining cast,Keira Knightley (who is nothing short of lovely here),Orlando Bloom,Geoffrey Rush,as well as the countless others play off of Depp very well.The cast,the action,the humor,and overall storytelling are outstanding.I would not recommend it for smaller children,as it can be somewhat violent in places,but you and your older children will have a good time with it.Walt Disney would be pleased.",8,0,3,12 April 2007
12 Angry Men," Not everything is what it seems.
","I love this film.I love it because it teaches us the lesson about how when someone's fate is in your hands,it's important to examine things from every angle.We as a society have a tendency to want to see people hang just because they fit our own personal idea of what a bad person is.If something bad happens and they happen to be nearby,we tend to make assumptions that this person participated just because of the stereotype we hang on them.Henry Fonda leads an excellent cast here in a film where dialog rules and you can cut the tension with a knife.Especially enjoyable was Lee J. Cobb's very dramatic monologue toward the film's end.A definite keeper.",9,0,0,4 November 2010
Happy Gilmore," Sandler is a riot!
","I have to admit that Adam Sandler's films are a source of guilty pleasure for me.While none of his films to date are considered comedy classics,the goal in each of them is to make you laugh,which I can honestly say they do.The whole idea of a wannabe overly violent hockey player turning to golf,after accidentally discovering a talent for it, to save his Grandmother's house,is absolutely hysterical,and Sandler delivers as only he can.Also giving a credible performance is Christopher MacDonald as the film's snobbish villain.So credible,in fact that you really feel like slapping him around not just a little,but a lot.Sandler's scenes with Bob Barker are so fall-down hysterical that I now consider them among my favorite all time comedy scenes.Overall, this may not be a lovable classic,but it is certainly a likable film.",6,1,6,21 May 2002
The Notebook," How love should be
","I am not a big fan of so-called 'chick flicks',but I found myself to be very affected by this film.A young man sets his sights on a beautiful young lady.She resists,mainly because at first she on a date with another fellow.He persists,eventually winning her heart.They are total opposites,and butt heads quite often,but opposites are supposed to attract.There are bumps in the road for the young couple,including a big one that leads the young lady at one point to be engaged to another.They get past this hurdle,only to find bigger ones down the road.This film successfully illustrates to us that true love overcomes the greatest of obstacles.Virtual newcomers Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as the young couple shine brightly,as do established veterans James Garner and Gena Rowlands as the couple in their later years.Although there are not many physical similarities between the two couples in my opinion,the sweet story line helps you past that rather well.I challenge anyone who isn't into romantic films to give it a look.You just might like it.Excellent film!",8,1,1,27 December 2005
Finding Nemo," A new age classic.
","When it comes to animation,I consider myself a devout traditionalist. I will always prefer hand drawn animation over computer any day of the week.However,there is no escaping the fact that this is a well done, entertaining film from Disney and Pixar.Keeping in mind the fact that fish,or anything else under water,can't talk,it's as if we are looking into an aquarium or watching actual undersea footage for the duration of the film.It is excellent family entertainment from start to finish. Pixar and Disney always seem to come up with a magical combination of near perfect animation right down to gestures and eye movements,and perfect voice casting.Ellen Degeneres is particularly hilarious as Dory. What we have here is a new age classic that even traditional,old fashioned people like myself can enjoy.",9,1,4,29 July 2004
The Great Dictator," Chaplin gives the best of both worlds.
","Charlie Chaplin is amazing to watch.He brought the very talents that mesmerized us in his great silent films to the sound era,thereby giving us the best of both worlds in this film.The sound era was unkind to many a silent star,but not Chaplin.He made the transition with flying colors.He showed us new talents,while not letting us forget all of those elements from his silent films that made him a star.There is great support all around him,and his final speech at the end was stunning.Upon seeing it once,I had to go back and watch it again several times,not only for Chaplin's great performance,but for it's rousing message,which could be considered just as relevant today.Great comedy film and great film.",8,1,2,28 August 2014
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How to Lose Interest in a Movie in 10 Minutes
","This film is like a falling rock.You know exactly where it is going,so after a small amount of time,you lose interest and turn away.Kate Hudson gives us her usual charm here,but even that isn't enough to save this predictable mishmash.Predictably,you know what characters are going to get together.Predictably,each one of them learns the underhanded schemes that the other was up to.Predictably,they get mad at one another,but end up discovering that they are truly in love with one another.We have been down this road so many times that the pavement is wearing thin and weeds are starting to grow through the cracks.Watching this film will only serve to remind you that there is nothing new under the sun.Save your money.",5,0,1,7 March 2005
The Mummy," Great fun!
","Brendan Fraser may well have established himself as the John Wayne of his day with his thrilling performance here.No one can take the place of the Duke of course,but Fraser approached his character with just the right amount of swagger,wit,and charm.This take on an often told story has all the charm of the old Saturday matinee's of years gone by,and all the thrills of the Raiders of the Lost Ark series.Excellent casting,with standout performances from everyone, particularly Arnold Vosloo,Fraser,and Oded Fehr.Highly recommended.",8,54,71,16 January 2002
The Terminator," One of Arnold's best
","There are actors,and there are movie stars.Arnold Schwarzenegger is without question a movie star,because every time he is on screen, he is,well,Arnold.There is a different Arnold in this film,and this     is what I like about it.He,for once,is playing the villain,and to perfection,I might add.He makes for one of the best screen villains ever in cinema history.It's a pity that his 'good guy' image won't allow him to play the bad seed more often,but that's Hollywood, I guess.Aside from the thrilling sequel,this is perhaps Arnold's best work.",9,97,135,26 February 2002
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," My favorite non stereotypical western.
","This is very different.In your stereotypical Western,the hero or heroes almost never run from a fight.Here,the heroes (if you can justify calling them that),spend the entire film running from a fight.Combine this with witty dialog and the undeniable screen chemistry between Redford and Newman,not to mention pleasant scenery,both in the form of filming location and the film's leading lady Katharine Ross,and you've got a winner on your hands.My favorite films in the western genre tend to be a little more on the stereotypical side,but I will say that this is probably my favorite western film that does not include John Wayne,Clint Eastwood,Gary Cooper,or Alan Ladd.",Null,0,1,18 September 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick got us through a tough time with humor.
","Some subjects are so frightening that the only way to deal with them is through humor,and Stanley Kubrick was smart enough to know that.It was the early 60's and nuclear war and the potential for destruction and devastation was very much on our minds.Though production was completed before the assassination of JFK,it would become all the more important to see after the event because things became even more tense then.Peter Sellers was just the man to put the icing on the cake.He played multiple roles here,the most hysterical of them being the title character,Dr. Strangelove.I hear that even the normally serious minded Kubrick had trouble stifling his laughter watching Sellers go.Simply put,he did his job well.The film got us all through a tough time.Well done.",8,1,4,15 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A climax worth waiting six years for.
","The first two were so good that we were compelled to come back for more,so sure that we would not be let down.We were not.The excitement picks up right where the previous installment left off without missing a beat,and the climax was well worth waiting for.Upon watching the film again recently for the first time in several years,I found myself to be just as engrossed in the film from start to finish as I was when I was eighteen years old viewing it in the theater all those years ago.I found myself to be just as excited at the thrilling final moments of the film as I was then.Boy,did it ever take me back to my youth.I should go there more often,and so should you.",9,1,3,15 February 2006
MASH," Glad I got to know the series first.
","I was a big fan of the MASH series.In fact,it is my favorite TV show,period.Oddly enough,I had never seen the movie until now.Now,that I have,I can honestly say that I am glad that I got to know the series first.The characters that we came to know and love because of the series were portrayed much differently here and as a result,they are much less likable.Another issue that I have is the perception that all people who read the Bible and kneel by their bedside to pray are automatically written off as nut jobs.Some may be,but certainly not all of them are.To be fair,perhaps the Frank Burns character as played by Robert Duvall did deserve his fate.All in all,I am glad I waited so long to view this film,because if I had seen the film first,I may never have given the series the time of day.",6,3,5,9 April 2011
Megamind," The unlikely hero.
","This is another film that I didn't think I would like.I don't know how I got the vibe,but it was just there.Finally,after hearing some good things about it elsewhere,I decided to give it a try.The results were good.The idea was a good one,and it was carried forward and presented very well.A stereotypical 'villain',after 'killing' his super hero rival,finds himself in a rut,so he creates a new super hero to keep him busy.Things go awry and the subsequent twists and turns in the story result in our villain friend becoming an unlikely hero.I think that's pretty cool,so I will more than likely have it on my DVD shelf in the near future.",8,1,1,25 December 2013
The Polar Express," A dream,for the kid in you.
","As a kid,I believed in Santa Claus,and that he lived at the North Pole,he ran a workshop where toys were made by elves,and that he delivered those toys on a sleigh pulled by eight tiny reindeer..I believed it all,not unlike any other kid.This film sent me into a dream like state,where I am that kid from long ago,and in this dream,I was a quiet little passenger,an up close observer of all that was transpiring,and at the end,when it was all said and done,I awakened from that dream.Thank you to all who made this film and brought forth that kid me who stays hidden all too often.This movie is a Christmas treasure.",8,1,3,29 December 2014
The Best Years of Our Lives," A worthwhile message that rings true still today.
","Returning to life at home for our overseas fighting men was not as easy as we here at home may have assumed,and McKinlay Kantor thought it important to write about this fact.The novel caught the attention of Hollywood and soon we were seeing it well illustrated on the big screen.War changes a man to one degree or another,either physically or emotionally or perhaps both.The passage of time doesn't help either,and things at home change a little.Their children grow,and they were unable to be there to witness it firsthand.Again,this makes the adjustment harder.For 4 years,all they knew was war,and they find themselves faced with the impossible task of picking up where they had left off.It's a worthwhile story to engross yourself in.While much of what you see here represents a world that does not exist anymore,the difficulties of adjusting to life at home after war ring true still today.",8,4,4,1 February 2013
Elf," The best Christmas film of the 21st Century (so far)
","A Christmas film is a Christmas film is a Christmas film,and only once every so often does one come along that becomes a must see every Christmas season.Elf is just such a film.Going in and knowing the type of humor that Will Ferrell represented,I went into my first viewing expecting to hate it.I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised to the contrary.I love it and it is an every Christmas must see at my house.The humor is clean and funny,the story has a very retro feel with hints of the Christmas movies and TV specials of our childhood.Ferrell was great as the central character and he was supported well.Bob Newhart was a nice touch as Papa Elf.I could go on and on.A fun film.",8,1,2,29 November 2013
Taxi Driver," A different kind of Superman.
","Travis Bickle is troubled.He is troubled by the decay of modern society.He is consistently looking for beauty in what he feels is a vermin ridden society.He finds it in the form a beautiful lady.He is drawn to her and wants to be part of her world.He gets there,but only briefly does he stay because he is so much a product of the world he loathes that he doesn't even realize it.His anger grows probably because he comes to that realization.He meets a child,the ultimate symbol of human innocence.She obviously has been robbed of that innocence by being forced into an adult world way too soon.His anger continues to grow and he begins to see himself as a champion of all those who have been affected by the decaying world.He doesn't fly,leap tall buildings in a single bound,or wear a red cape,but he and Clark Kent have something in common:They see a hero when they look in the mirror.",8,0,0,26 February 2012
Full Metal Jacket," Preparing for war is hell.
","First,let me state,that this is without question the nastiest movie,in terms of language,that I have ever seen.I am normally a person,who, though I rarely use bad language myself,am able to tolerate it when I hear it.With this film,however,I found myself blushing at the language used by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (they could not have picked a better actor to portray this man than R. Lee Ermey,by the way).Not only is war hell,preparing for it can be just as bad,if you don't have a healthy state of mind to begin with.This is the case for Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio,who really packed on the pounds for this role).You can almost feel him cracking throughout the first portion of the film,leading to a violent showdown with his tormenting commanding officer.The second half of the film is a basic display of the horrors of war itself,and very well done.Excellent direction by Stanley Kubrick,who always seemed to have a knack for not repeating himself a director,in terms of the types of films he directed.This was his 'war' film,and it's an absolute masterpiece.Must see film.",8,5,9,10 April 2002
The Grapes of Wrath," They lost,they suffered,they endured.
","The Grapes of Wrath is a great,gripping film about an Oklahoma family that lose their farm and,using what little means they have left,reluctantly leave their long time homestead and head west to seek a return to prosperity.Along the long journey,they endure death,sickness,hunger,and nearly go down to defeat,but endure.The cast is spearheaded by the strong presence of Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell.The film really goes after the viewers' emotions.To beat an old cliché to death,'you'll laugh,you'll cry...'.The emotional goodbye between mother and son at the end was among the most heart wrenching I have ever seen.I liked it.Can you tell?",8,0,1,13 September 2013
Forrest Gump," On second thought..............I like it.
","This is one film that I have to say did not leave a lasting impression on me all of those years ago,but since many factors play a part in whether or not you enjoy a film,and since it is obviously an Oscar winner loved by many,I recently decided to give it a second chance viewing.I am happy to report that I have had a total change of heart.We have here a story about a young man who is,to say the least,seemingly a bit slower than you and I.Yet,unlike many who are slow,he gains fame and prestige.The sweet thing about Forrest Gump is that none of that fame and prestige ever seemed to be that important to him.True love is the only thing that he ever really wanted,yet it always seemed to evade him because the girl he loved was always running away to find herself.Foolishly,she couldn't see that where she belonged was where she always seemed to be when she failed to find herself elsewhere:right there with Forrest.With Forrest Gump,you will laugh at the way he stumbles his way through the history books,yet you will be touched at the way he touches those around him,and will cheer for him to find the love he deserves.You will ultimately learn that you don't have to have that much book smarts to know what is important in life.",5,2,6,18 March 2008
"Monsters, Inc."," An excellent idea well carried out.
","I can't say enough about Pixar's animation,and I have said plenty about it,but what makes this my favorite Pixar film to date is the story.It is definitely the most unique storyline of all of Pixar's films.The whole idea of those monsters that we all thought were in our closets when we were children being a blue collar work force and living in world very much parallel to our own was an excellent one,and it was carried out to perfection as always.Whenever my kids want to watch a DVD,but don't mention a particular title,this is the one I most often reach for.That way,I get to be a kid right along with them,if only for a hour and a half.Well done.",8,0,1,1 December 2006
The Godfather: Part II," All Time Best Sequel
","I'm sure any film maker will tell you that if you produce a film widely considered to be great,you are taking quite a risk when you consider a sequel to that film,because you always run the risk of disappointing that audience that you wowed with the first film.Many have taken the risk and did just that.They disappointed the audiences and left a sour taste in their mouths.Not so here.Francis Ford Copolla,in making this follow up to The Godfather,made a genius move.He not only gave us a great follow up story to the one that won us over two years earlier,he interwove it with how the story of the Corleones came to be.Any sequel to a successful film is a risky move,but Copolla took the gamble and it paid off and then some.Easily the best sequel ever made.",9,0,2,30 May 2013
Fargo," Couldn't see the humor for all the dead bodies.
","I can see the humor in Fargo.The characters have a quirkiness and a dialect that most would find at least a little humorous,particularly that of Marge Gunderson.They do and say things that would give you at least a slight chuckle.The American Film Institute ranks it not only in their top 100 greatest films in cinema history,but it is also in their top 100 funniest films.It has a uniqueness that I suppose qualifies it for both lists,but speaking on a personal taste level,I had trouble laughing at this film's humor due to the fact that there were so many dead bodies lying in the way.I don't argue with what the AFI calls a great film,but I just didn't connect with this film at all,and this will most likely be my first and last trip to Fargo.",6,0,1,16 April 2007
The Aviator," DiCaprio gives performance of a lifetime,but film should have gone further.
","My only disappointment with this film is that it did not go deeper into the life of Howard Hughes.He led an indeed bizarre life from the beginning to the end.Every minute could make a compelling film.Leo DiCaprio gives the performance of a lifetime here which far surpasses anything he has done in the past.We get to know him through Leo not only as the passionate aviator that he was,but as the mentally troubled soul that he was.DiCaprio covers both areas very well.I only wish the film would have gone further into his life as I said before.Perhaps a sequel would be in order.Particularly compelling to me were the scenes between DiCaprio and Alan Alda as Senator Bruster.Thoroughly electric!Cate Blanchett is also worthy of note,in her excellent portrayal of Kathryn Hepburn.Worthwhile viewing.",7,4,8,21 June 2005
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," A great morale booster!
","Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as 'Sergeant Major Dickerson',the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",8,84,94,15 March 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Despite not normally being into films of this genre,I really enjoyed it.
","I have to begin by saying that I am not a huge fan of films with a mythical theme,but I do have to admit that the storyline in this film kept me intrigued enough to want to watch the entire series to it's conclusion.CGI's don't impress me much because all too often,they are distracting to the point of making a film look rather cartoonish,but it doesn't seem to be a problem at all in this film.The acting was very impressive,and the story is top notch,as I said.I recommend this to all who,like me,don't normally enjoy films with this type of theme.You will be pleasantly surprised and will be itching to see how it all will conclude.",8,1,2,21 November 2012
Grease," Automatic! Systematic! Hyyyydromatic!!!
","I must begin by stating that I love this movie.I recall sitting there in the theater at the age of 13 totally mesmerized by it. I love the characters and the way they were presented.I already had a crush on Olivia Newton-John before the film came out,and I must say it truly enhanced it.I can recall wanting to sing along with all the songs,but I didn't know the words yet.I later bought the soundtrack album.I don't mean a tape or CD,I mean the actual vinyl album,which I still have to this day and it's still in great condition.I now know the words by heart and sing every tune on it. The characters in this movie won me over so well, that I hated to see them go at the end.Travolta is excellent as Danny Zucco,in his really good early days as an actor.There are moments and language you might want to shield your kids from,but all in all a fun,fantastic film.I highly recommend it.",9,2,5,3 October 2001
Radio," Story of local celebrity could have been better
","Speaking as someone who currently resides and works in the area that the real 'Radio' Kennedy is from,I think that though the acting in this film was excellent,the story could have been told much better.There were areas,such as the death of Radio's mother,where perhaps a little too much was left to the imagination.Also,Radio's brother is mentioned but never seen.I think perhaps these holes played a part in the overall film falling flat.His story deserved a much better telling,and it is disappointing,considering the Anderson,SC area's anticipation for seeing their good friend's story on the big screen.The only bright spots to speak of are the performances of Cuba Gooding,Jr. and Ed Harris.Otherwise,this is a dismal failure of a movie.",5,0,1,4 January 2005
Cast Away," It's all about survival.
","After watching this film several times,first at the theater,then at home,I've reached the conclusion that it's about survival.Not just about Chuck Noland's survival,but the survival of the most important person in his life,Kelly.He lost civilization as he knew it,and had to use his resources to survive.Kelly,although very little is shown from her point of view,lost the most important person in her life.Both suffered losses, and though it was hard,they did what they could to survive and get on with their lives.I have no doubt that many see this film as being just about Chuck and his survival on a deserted island for four years,but if they look at it more deeply,they will see much,much more.Great acting and chemistry by Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.A must see!",8,0,1,8 October 2002
The Village," Overwhelming disappointment.
","I will not trash the favorable reviews of this film.I can only speak for myself personally and say that I was disappointed.After viewing Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense back in 1999,and remembering how it had me totally fooled,I find myself looking for clues in subsequent films of his.I did so while viewing this film.I found those clues and as a result,I saw the ending coming from a mile away.I was not fooled,I was not shocked.I was simply left with an empty feeling.Again,I won't say that the film is bad in any way,but being one who looks for films to leave a lasting impression on me,and based on what I have come to expect from a Shyamalan film,that it totally missed the mark for this movie goer.",4,0,1,16 February 2005
North by Northwest," Another masterpiece from the master.
","You got to love Cary Grant.I think Alfred Hitchcock did too,but differently than the rest of us.For years,we had seen Cary charm his way out of many a situation with the greatest of ease.I think Hitchcock always pounced on the idea of putting Grant in situations he could not so easily charm his way out of.North By Northwest is a prime example of this fact.I think maybe Grant enjoyed these ventures with Hitchcock because it was always a chance to escape the image we had of him.Eva Marie Saint gives a delicious performance as Eve Kendall,so sexually charged that the more weak amongst us may end up needing a cold shower.Another Hitchcock classic.",9,0,0,30 October 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Doesn't quite 'bust' the 'block'.
","To add a third installment to a very good film and it's even better sequel takes a lot of doing,particularly if you are going to press on with the project without the director that is responsible for the success of the first two.James Cameron is no where behind the camera for T3,and this will be obvious to anyone watching.Also absent is Linda Hamilton,another big reason for the success of the previous two films. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger,the man we have come to know and love as the T100,doesn't quite seem the same anymore.The computer generated special effects are just a little too obvious for my taste,and the entire film takes on the feel of a small,made for cable,or straight to video dud instead of a big screen blockbuster.I don't watch very many sequels, because they all too often disappoint me and ruin my memory of the previous film.I thought,in this case that since the second film surpassed the first in terms of quality viewing,that this third installment would at least measure up to one of those two.Much to my dismay,I was wrong.If this film could not have been directed by Cameron, it should have been given to someone on the same class as him,such as Ridley Scott.Perhaps it would have stood a better chance of being good.",5,0,1,17 May 2004
Doctor Zhivago," Complicated Love
","Meet Lara.Beautiful,complicated,Lara.So beautiful is Lara that she inspires uncontrollable lust in her Mother's lover,yet her beauty is no match for the passion of war that consumes the man she chooses to marry.True love knocks during her volunteer work as a nurse for the war effort.True love in the form a doctor.A married doctor.Beautiful,complicated Lara manages to make the life of this doctor complicated as well.David Lean has another epic masterpiece in this beautifully done,keep-the-tissues-handy-by-the-easy-chair love story.Easily one of the best,if not THE best love story ever put on film.",8,0,0,3 January 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One sequel that out does the original
","I am not a big fan of sequels,as most of them disappoint,but T2 certainly does not.In fact,it's a rare case,at least in my opinion, of a sequel actually surpassing the original film in terms of greatness.As in 99.9% of his films,Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy once again,but you don't mind once you witness the incredible villain performance of Robert Patrick.This film is nothing short of a beginning to end thrill ride.Let us not forget the talents of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong,who gave great supporting efforts.Thumbs up!",9,219,277,26 February 2002
Duck Soup," Don't blink.You are liable to miss a laugh or two.
","Today's comedians are nothing compared to the likes of the Marx Brothers.These comedic forefathers worked harder to get a laugh in one film than today's comedians do in a career.Duck Soup is documented proof of this.They are in no less than top form here.We have Groucho,who delivers one liners with lightning quick speed,Harpo,who never uttered a word,but he never needed to,Chico,who supported Harpo with perfection,and Zeppo,who in my opinion was not particularly funny,but made a great straight man for the others.Last but not least,Margaret Dumont.Without her,the guys would have been somewhat less successful.She was practically a Marx 'sister'.Duck Soup has nothing to do with ducks.Duck Soup has nothing to do with soup.When you watch,you'll be too busy laughing to care.It's comedy at it's classic best.I'll end with my favorite line:'He may look like an idiot.He may talk like an idiot,but don't let that fool you.He really is an idiot.'",9,4,6,28 March 2007
Apocalypse Now," One disappointing moment erases all high marks.
","When going in to view a movie about the Vietnam War,one must factor in that there will be dark disturbing imagery involved,so I was prepared for that aspect.As the film rolled along,I found myself very captivated by it's story.A highly decorated colonel has gone mad and is wanted for murder.Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is selected to seek out the mad colonel and 'terminate with extreme prejudice'.I found the story very compelling and very well executed.I was prepared to give it high marks...until the ox scene.Sorry folks,but I have a problem with witnessing a helpless animal being viciously slaughtered on camera.I don't care what it does for the story.It could have simply been implied and I would have been OK with that.Seriously,when they killed the ox, they killed the high opinion of what I saw leading up to it.I won't be back to see this again.",6,1,4,5 July 2013
Disturbia," Worth watching despite the fact that we've seen the plot before.
","It's a formula we have seen before in films.I don't even need to mention that certain Hitchcock film that everyone compares this film to because just about everyone else does that.I will just say that if something is done well,it doesn't matter that we have seen the plot before.The point of every good thriller is to keep the viewer on their toes,and Disturbia does that very well.Particularly worthy of note is the performance of David Morse,who has amazing versatility as an actor and can play the hero as well as the villain with equal prowess.Everyone did a good job here.Disturbia will probably never be labeled a classic because another film with a similar plot has already claimed that prize,but it's worth watching just the same.",8,0,2,2 December 2008
Divergent," Snore.
","My wife and I chose this film on a date night because it seemed to be the best option at the local theater,which isn't saying much.I'm not much on futuristic films,but I gave this one a whirl anyhow.I guess the fact that Kate Winslet was in it had something to do with that,seeing as how she is one of my favorite actresses,and this time,she's a bad girl.The rest of the cast,I couldn't say I was familiar with.The final verdict,given everything I just said was one you might expect.I was completely dulled out by this film.Not even Kate could save me from wanting my money back.So much for an exciting date night.Oh well,the wife and I had each other,which is always great!",5,0,0,26 September 2014
Collateral," Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.
","If Alfred Hitchcock were alive and making movies today,I firmly feel that they would look something like this excellent thriller from Michael Mann.Tom Cruise makes an excellent turn going against type as a hired killer.Also excellent are Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith in their supporting roles.It's very rare that you can compare any modern day thrillers with the likes of Hitchcock,but I feel safe in saying that he would give a thumbs up here.It has enough plot twists and turns to keep the audience on the edge,and again,Cruise does a great job of making us hate him,if only for a couple of hours.It's definitely worth the rental, and worth buying and placing with your Hitchcock favorites.",7,49,98,27 January 2005
Ratatouille," Pixar's animation still impresses,but story is somewhat drier.
","While Pixar's animation continues to impress and get better with each passing film,this effort I find to be somewhat drier than previous films.The story is somewhat more adult oriented,as it speaks of death and romance,but this is not to say that it is a bad film in way.It isn't.Some of the elements are somewhat silly,such as a rat controlling a young chef's body motions by tugging his hair,but the overall story should be enjoyable enough to make you overlook this.Also,there is one aspect to this film that other Pixar outings do not have;more human characters.In the past it has been talking toys,monsters,insects,fish,and automobiles.Yes,you do have talking rodents here,but it is refreshing to see more humanity in a Pixar film.See it.You will at least like it if not love it.",8,0,1,10 August 2007
Enchanted," An age old story told in a refreshing new way.
","This is a pretty risky move when you think about it.The film takes an age old storyline,one that Disney has done at least a million times,it seems,and does something totally different with it.It transforms from age old fairy tale to a modern day fish out of water story,and with very entertaining results.The beginning of the film,that is to say the animated part of it,at times appears to be a parody of many of Disney's classic films,but the live action portion of the film makes up for it quite well as these fantasy characters adapt to a totally new world.The film will entertain your children as Disney seldom fails to do,and you yourself will be refreshed to see this age old story told in such a new way.",7,1,2,15 January 2008
Quantum of Solace," Less dark than it's predecessor.
","Again,we have a somewhat darker James Bond in this film,but that is to be expected given that this is a sequel to Casino Royale,picking up right where that story left off.Visibly absent are all of the fun quips and innuendo that we all came to love the Bond series for,as the main character seems to be gravitating more toward an action hero type.That being said,the film,while dark,is somewhat less dark than it's predecessor,making it more enjoyable for hardcore traditional Bond fans.In the end,I don't think that Daniel Craig will be replacing Sean Connery as my favorite James Bond,but I do believe,against that mass of critics out there,that he is very much suited for the role.Very entertaining film.",8,3,8,6 June 2009
Gone with the Wind," Still packs a wallop!
","In viewing this film in it's entirety for the first time in many years,I found myself mesmerized by it's power.Movie making was still pretty much in it's infancy at the time,and Gone With the Wind packs a wallop that can still be felt today nearly 75 years later.There's not many films of it's generation that I personally would say that about.A true monument to how hard Hollywood used to work on it's films.The story is very powerful,and the cast,right down to the supporting characters,give off an awesome screen presence.It's one of those that I wish I could have seen on the big screen,because as awesome as it is on the small screen,it must've blown folks away back in the day.Classic!",9,2,4,13 December 2013
No Country for Old Men," An ultimate cat and mouse thriller.
","I like this film for it's cat and mouse atmosphere.It's one of the best ever produced for it's type.Tommy Lee Jones is a favorite and never ceases to add to the appeal of any film,but what fascinates me most about this film is the Javier Bardem character.This is one of the most intimidating figures I have ever seen when it comes to cinematic villainry.He can bring out the vulnerability in even the cockiest of people.This is best evidenced in Carson Wells,played by Woody Harrelson.You would think by Wells' demeanor,that he wouldn't be backed into a corner so easily by this man,yet he is,and the change in demeanor is astounding.This a strong film from top to bottom and shouldn't be missed.",9,1,3,29 September 2008
Remember the Titans," Enjoy the film,look up the real facts later.
","Being a football fan,I'm naturally drawn to any movie about football,particularly those based on true stories.The fact that Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors has even more pull.From a historical standpoint,this was a story that needed to be told.I'm glad that the Disney company was in charge of telling it because that means that it will be void of most if not all unnecessary bad language.Hollywood takes it's usual liberties and dresses the story up in certain places,which makes it somewhat less historically accurate,but that's OK.You have an enjoyable film here,and if you want to know the real facts about the real people the story is based on,you can always educate yourself by looking them up.It's a great film.Enjoy!",8,0,1,27 October 2014
Liar Liar," Definitely among Carrey's best work.
","Jim Carrey's best work starts with the story ideas that,when seen on paper,make you laugh.The whole idea of a lawyer who is unable to lie is indeed a funny one.I remember Carrey himself,in an interview plugging the film,said that he was drawn to the film based on that very idea.Couple that with Jim Carrey's great comedic abilities and you have a film worth watching.There are others,it should be noted,that worked just as hard to make the film funny as Carrey did,most notably Swoosie Kurtz and Carey Elwes.When ranking Jim Carrey's films from best to worst,no two people will rank the films in the same order,but I think it is safe to say that Liar Liar will end up in the upper tier of everyone's,or at least most people's list.",7,1,1,12 July 2009
Saving Private Ryan," A truly inspirational film.
","It's not easy to recreate something so horrid as war.In fact,I don't think that anyone can totally recreate it with overwhelming success.You can get ideas from the people who were there,and that certainly gets the imagination going,but no matter how bad you make it look,only the those folks who were there have a clue.That being said,the astounding recreation of the Normandy invasion in this film is sure to make you ask questions as to how much worse it really could have been.It is an amazing piece of work and I admire the way that John Williams' musical score was saved for the battle's aftermath rather than during the battle itself.All you heard during the battle was the sound of combat.Spielberg wanted to make sure to make the viewing experience of this historic battle was as real as possible.Well done.I also enjoy this excellent story of how these eight men were sent out to risk it all so that one man could go home and salvage what was left of his mother's shattered heart.It's truly one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen.",8,2,4,28 April 2008
Lawrence of Arabia," Awesome!
","This film has everything needed to qualify it for greatness.Great storytelling and acting,great direction by David Lean,and I will go ahead and say it.It has the most spectacular music score and cinematography I have ever seen in any film to date.I was blown away by it and the interesting thing is I never got to see it in a movie theater.I am jealous of anyone who has,because it had to be nothing short of awesome.The combination of extreme wide shots and closeups is like nothing I have ever seen in a film.If you have never seen this,don't deny yourself any further.You will be in awe of every aspect of it.I guarantee it!",9,2,6,15 November 2006
Cars," More perfection from Pixar!
","It goes without saying that Pixar has perfected the art of giving human like qualities to both inanimate objects and animate creatures that we are not accustomed to having those qualities.They have once again combined their excellently detailed animation with a great story that you will be captivated by,and excellently voiced characters that you will come to care about.There is even a legendary Oscar winning actor in the voice cast in Paul Newman,as well as many other heavyweights that you will easily recognize.Stealing the show,however is none other than Larry the Cable Guy as Mater,the rusty old tow truck,but I am biased,as I am from the south.Pixar continues to get better with every passing year.My only concern for them is that they will one day run out of inanimate objects to give life to.Another thing I like about the film is it's combination of two of my young son's loves:animated movies and motorized vehicles.Well done Pixar,keep up the good work!",9,3,6,1 July 2006
Ghost Rider," Middle of the road for Nick Cage
","Nicolas Cage has an undeniable screen charm that,in my book,is comparable to the likes of Bogart,Grant,Brando,the list goes on.This fact alone makes him one of my favorite actors of all time.Every good actor,however,can disappoint as well as delight.Nick Cage has done his fair share of both over the years.Ghost Rider,for me,ends up somewhere in the middle.While I enjoyed the superhero aspects of the main character,the ever present charm of Nick Cage,the undeniable beauty that is possessed by Eva Mendes,and the performances of Peter Fonda and Wes Bentley,where the film comes up flat is overall storyline and dialog,two key factors that make or break a movie.The storyline is somewhat choppy and the dialog is flat and unimpressive.I will give it above average marks for special effects,though.From Nicolas Cage's best work to his worst,Ghost Rider is somewhere in the middle,making it just barely unworthy of being a keeper.",6,2,6,19 February 2007
Schindler's List," People can change.
","Schindler's List is an amazing story and a great documentation of how we can change as people.A man with greedy,immoral intentions can become a man whom statues are erected in honor of.Liam Neeson gives an amazing performance as Oskar Schindler,a greedy business man who uses Jewish folk as cheap labor and is totally blind to how he is helping them as a people.Neeson's slow character transformation was a thing of beauty to watch and great support was given by Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes.It is also the best documentation of just how things were for the Jewish community during the WWII era and I would highly recommend it to all who love great cinema.",8,16,25,22 November 2013
The Elephant Man," A story of inner beauty and society's failure to recognize it.
","I first saw this film at the age of 15,and many things about it have remained with me over the years.Firstly,I admire any film maker who is bold enough to use black and white film in the day and age of color.Somehow black and white film seems to get the point across better when used in the right situations,and this is definitely a film that calls for it.This is an excellent film about inner beauty and about how we as a society all too often fail to see it.There are a lot of ignorant people in this world who think that outer beauty is the only thing that matters.This movie exposes that ignorance and does it very well.John Hurt gave an Oscar caliber performance,and he not only deserved a nomination,he deserved a win as well.See this film and see if it doesn't make you take a long look at what kind of person you are.",9,2,3,1 October 2001
I Am Legend," A refreshing new twist on an old idea,with few flaws.
","The whole flesh eating zombie idea has been seemingly done to death,but what I like about this film is instead of a small group of people fighting them off,all we have is one man,or so it seems,and his dog.The man happens to be a scientist,one of the best in the field.He struggles to find a cure to the disease infesting these people while having to fend them off alone.Or is he alone?I find this new angle very refreshing and exciting.Will Smith does a credible job here as he continues to establish himself in the science fiction genre.The only real flaw I see in the film is that these 'zombies',while intimidating,are featured with a little too much computer graphics.I think they would have been just as scary without them.Good film.",7,1,4,8 January 2008
Amadeus," Great uniquely told biography
","Amadeus is a biographical film told from a very unique perspective.It is the life of Mozart as told from the perspective of a very perplexed rival.Salieri(F. Murray Abraham) is perplexed because as he sees it,a talent for music is a gift from God,and he cannot for the life of him understand why such a gift is given to what he describes as a crass,crude,vulgar creature such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(Tom Hulce,and gives him,a more respectful and God fearing man,next to nothing in return.It is obvious from start to finish that all involved worked very hard to make this a great film.The hard work paid off in leaps and bounds.Great film!",Null,0,1,27 August 2011
Ghostbusters," Great marriage of comedy and spookiness
","Very rarely can you pull off a successful blend of two separate movie genres,but the makers of Ghostbusters were overwhelmingly so.On the one hand,you have the comedic charm of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd,and on the other,a genuine ghostly spookiness that makes you want to hide under a blanket.I recently bought a copy and watched it for the first time in several years,and it's still just as fresh as it was in it's initial release in 1984.It has a great supporting cast for Murray and Aykroyd,including the always great Sigourney Weaver,Rick Moranis,Ernie Hudson,and Harold Ramis,who is just as talented behind the camera as he is in front of it.Watch it with your family,but keep an eye on younger children,as the spookiness may be more than they can handle. Great stuff.",8,61,76,8 August 2002
Gran Torino," Great mixture of yesterday's Clint and today's.
","There's no denying that Clint Eastwood has come a long way as a movie director.He has multiple Oscars to prove that.However,there are those of us who long to see that grit teeth Clint Eastwood that we came to know and love years ago,whether it was in the form of that certain no name drifter of the old west,or in that of that certain rule bending San Francisco cop.What we have in Gran Torino is a grand mixture of both those aspects of this Hollywood legend.Mixed in with that,we have a great story of a man,having had nothing but bitterness and hatred in his heart most of his life,finally being able to let go and find friendship in the unlikeliest of places.Eastwood fans should not miss this and most likely will not,and even if you are not a big fan,you will enjoy the story.",8,1,6,14 June 2009
Patton," Among the best character studies in film history.
","General George S.Patton was a man who loved his country.If George C.Scott's portrayal was even remotely like the real Patton,then he no doubt would have taken on entire armies by himself armed with nothing but a stick.Very few actors have so immersed themselves in a character so deeply that they made me forget that they were only acting.George C.Scott,after my first viewing of this film just two days ago,is one of the rare few that have pulled this off.While the supporting cast is nothing short of credible,Scott's performance is so profound that it comes off as a virtual one man show.It is one of the best character studies in cinema history,and should not be missed.",8,3,6,3 December 2006
The Illusionist," A well dressed and very magical love story.
","The first thing that wows me about this film is it's cinematography.I admire how it is given a silent movie style dressing up because of the time period in which it is set,yet has modern day elements that you would have never seen in a silent film.Secondly,it is a well told love story about a magician with truly unbelievable powers,who uses those unbelievable powers to gain what is seemingly unreachable to him because of his status in life:the woman he believes to be his soul mate.Edward Norton is remarkable as the title character,while Paul Giamatti gives a performance that further enhances his maturity as an actor.The biggest surprise here is Jessica Biel,who is not someone you would picture in this role,yet she shows amazing potential and shines very brightly.Highly recommended.",9,7,9,18 March 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Agree or disagree with it's controversial ending,you'll come away knowing you just watched a powerful drama.
","Clint Eastwood just continues to top himself as a film maker.His latest masterpiece is Million Dollar Baby.This powerful,moving drama will have you cheering,as well as bring you to tears.All performances are memorable,particularly that of Hilary Swank.It is not often,in my opinion,that Oscars go to the right people.This is indeed a rare case of the award being given to the rightful person.Eastwood shines just as much in front of the camera as well as behind it,and he never goes wrong pairing himself with Morgan Freeman,whose Oscar was also well deserved(he was long overdue).The ending is a controversial one,as you will see,or probably have heard about in advance.Whether or not you agree with it,you will come away knowing that you have just watched an overwhelmingly powerful,dramatic film,proof that Clint Eastwood has indeed matured as a director.Like fine wine,he gets better with age.",8,3,5,5 January 2006
Caddyshack," Underneath the raunchiness and toilet humor,an enjoyable film
","I liked Caddyshack for it's basic comedy elements.Ted Knight often never got enough credit for his basic comedic talent.His knack for vocal and physical reactions are classic and he shines here,as always.The film is loaded with legendary comedic talent,from Bill Murray,on down to Dangerfield,who was appearing in his first film.I loved the whole 'snobs vs. slobs' angle and the way it all came to an end.The area in which I have to start deducting points is,(and I will probably take a hit or two for this)is where all of the raunchiness and toilet humor come in.I am not a big fan of either,but there wasn't enough of it there to keep me from finding the film enjoyable overall.",7,0,1,23 November 2012
Paranormal Activity," Not great,but better than all other similarly themed films.
","We've seen the formula before.'Footage' taken with a home video camera that was found after the folks in the footage vanished.It's all too easy to compare this film to the likes of The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield because there's a similar pattern in all of them.Had this type of film not been done before,I would call this movie 'inventive',but this can't be done since that credit goes to BWP.What I can do,since this is the latest in a string of similarly themed films,is call it the best of the lot.This movie did it's job in terms of giving me a good fright or two,and I would easily place it amongst other fright films for viewing on Halloween.",7,0,2,19 September 2010
Hotel Transylvania," Sandler and the boys rock in animated form!
","They started out with a good idea.They enhanced that good idea with a well written story,above average,although not the best animation,brought together a group of voices that we already love hearing together,and came up with a fairly decent final product.Adam Sandler,in my view,hasn't had much to brag about in terms of his film career in the last 9 or 10 years,but he now has that long overdue winner that I have been waiting for,even if it is in animated form.It's a well written humorous story,delivered well by some of today's funniest folks.It was definitely worth the rental (twice),and I no doubt will have it in my own personal collection in the near future.",8,0,3,26 December 2013
Major League," A genuinely funny fantasy
","The Cleveland Indians:A Major League Baseball club not without its troubles.For over thirty years,this team never even contended for any type of glory.It became taken for granted over the years that the tribe would finish in the cellar or not far from it.Although things have improved for the club in recent years,in 1989,the year of this film's release,things were still far from glorious.This film takes a great story idea,applies it to one the American League's most historically troubled clubs,and the results are fantastic.It not only gave the long suffering Indian fans something to smile about,it perhaps catapulted the team into it's less troubled and more satisfying years of today. This is is a genuinely funny,well casted baseball comedy that's well worth a look.",8,0,2,6 June 2002
Annie Hall," Tolerable even if you're not a fan of Allen.
","I'm not a big Woody Allen fan,so it's hard for me to look forward to viewing one of his films.'Why not just steer clear of them?' you may ask.Well,some of his films are part of a particular list of films that I challenged myself to review,so in order to stay true,I watch when I come to them.I have to say that although I am not a fan,that Annie Hall turned out to be halfway decent for my taste.I found myself less offended by the humor in this film than in any of the other Allen films I have watched.It's basically a quirky little love story.All love has it's quirks,and Woody Allen did a good job in bringing some of them to light in Annie Hall.",7,0,1,17 June 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," Visually stunning.Kubrick's best work.
","This is one of those films that make me wish I had been around to see it on the big screen.I envy those that got that opportunity,because as visually stunning as it is on the small screen,it had to be 100 times so in the theater.The orchestral arrangements during space sequences were the best possible soundtrack for what would be a silent visual in reality.The other visual effect,such as those inside the space craft look to be way ahead of their time.As for the story,it plays just like a thriller as we have a great man vs. machine angle.Of all the Stanley Kubrick films I have viewed to date.This visually stunning production is by far the best.",8,1,2,4 September 2013
Toy Story," Proof that Pixar not only cares about the quality of their work,they care about our kids.
","Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.",9,65,80,30 December 2005
The Graduate," Well done combination of stories.
","The Graduate's brilliance lies in the fact that it is a combination of stories.In the beginning,we have a tale of the crossroads between youth and manhood and the confusion that usually goes with it.In the second half,we have a simple tale of romance that gets complicated by the events in the first half.Dustin Hoffman was brilliant in his profession even then.He displays the awkwardness of youth's comical,clumsy ascension into manhood with flying colors.Anne Bancroft was there to nudge him along,manipulating his inexperience for selfish reasons,thereby adding complication when Hoffman's character finds the love of his life,which happens to be Bancroft's daughter.It is a well blended mix of comedy and drama.",7,0,0,13 December 2013
Singin' in the Rain," Doubly good for it's strong story AND musical aspects.
","Singin' in the Rain,though a musical,would have been a great film even if had not been one because the story is such a strong one.The idea of trying to help a famous star of the silent screen,whose voice is,shall we say,less than appealing,transcend into talking films to keep her star power alive.The story alone is hysterical and worth the price paid to see it,but here you get the added bonus of some extraordinary singing and dancing by some of the best in the business.To watch them work with such precision timing is a thing of beauty.Thirdly,it's one of the best classic comedies that I have ever seen.An all around great viewing experience.",8,0,2,15 November 2013
This Is Spinal Tap," Funny,underneath the bad language.
","Having assigned myself to review this film,I knew pretty much what to expect from it by it's reputation and rating..I deduct points for foul language.It's just me.It's how I roll.Peel away all of that and you have a fairly funny 'mockumentary' here.Rob Reiner did a fantastic job of bringing the film across as a real documentary,and Michael McKean and company as Spinal Tap were dead on.They had Ozzy Osbourne fooled into thinking it was the real deal,after all,so that alone says they did their jobs well.Did I laugh? In places,yes.Would I buy it? No,because I've grown to long in the tooth for films overrun with foul language,plus I have small kids.It was a nice visit,but it's doubtful I will visit again.",7,0,4,15 December 2014
The Mummy Returns," He should have stayed where he was.
","I have mentioned before that 9 times out of 10,sequels to great films,such as 'The Mummy', lead to disappointment and wasted money.I'm afraid this film is no exception.The performances were good,particularly Brendan Fraser,who is really coming into his own as a fine actor,so the problem is not there.This movie suffers from a very weak story line.It's as if they had to dig pretty deep for another story to tell.Another problem I have is with 'The Rock', or Dwayne Johnson,whichever he prefers to be called.There was so much hype over his appearance in this film,that when you went to the theater,you expected him to play a major role.He was in it for a grand total of 3 minutes,if that long.If that's all we were going to see of him,he didn't deserve that much hype.All in all,it's called 'The Mummy Returns',but if this is as good a sequel as they were going to do,he should have stayed where he was.",4,0,1,14 October 2001
There's Something About Mary," Great premise ruined by over the top,vulgar humor.
","I like the premise of this movie a lot.Cameron Diaz was perfect in her role as Mary,the girl that every guy dreams of,although not always in a flattering way..Ben Stiller was a perfect lead.It had all the makings for a great comedy and in the eyes of many,it is a great comedy.Here's what killed it for me personally,however:The over the top GROSS humor.I'm just not into it,and I may well have nightmares about the,shall I say,bodily function humor contained here.It's embedded in my mind and it will,no doubt take a long time to shake it.It ruined what would have been an otherwise enjoyable viewing experience.I won't be visiting this film again.",5,0,1,7 November 2014
Saw," Despite big name talent,just another run of the mill gore fest.
","You would think that without the big names that appear here in this film (Danny Glover,Cary Elwes,Monica Potter...) that this would be just another run of the mill gore fest.The trouble is,even with these big names,it still becomes exactly that.Another run of the mill gore fest. While the film does have moments of genuine fright,it is,in the end, another lame excuse to splatter blood all over the screen.When it comes to the horror genre,I have generally seen more bad than good,so I am normally skeptical before viewing a film.I had gotten the vibe before viewing this that it could be something special.Disappointingly,it is not.Pardon the pun,but do not see Saw!",4,0,1,21 June 2005
Up," Improving upon perfection
","At the risk of sounding like a broken record,I never cease to be amazed by Pixar and the work that they do.Their animation,which was great from day one,is even better now,and they have surrounded it with one of their strongest stories to date,not to mention their always perfect voice casting.Ed Asner lends a great voice to the story's lead character,and what would a Pixar film be without the great voice talent of John Ratzenberger? I took the family to see it today to celebrate my son's passing of the 3rd grade and we all loved it.By all means,don't wait for the DVD.This mesmerizing film should be experienced on the big screen.",9,1,2,4 June 2009
A Clockwork Orange," A strange film indeed,oh my brothers! But good!
","It goes without saying that Stanley Kubrick had unique visions when it came to film making,steering clear of any traditional styles and clichés.What struck me about A Clockwork Orange was it's unique dialog and unique musical soundtrack.Who would've ever thought we would see or hear Singin' in the Rain or Beethoven's 5th in such a way as it is here?The plot of this film is to say the least,bizarre.It all takes on the appearance of a strange English dream,yet something about it is very appealing.Despite it's strangeness,you are compelled to keep watching.It's one of those rare films that makes it difficult to tell anyone about it or give away any of the plot line.You just have to see it for yourself,and that qualifies it for greatness.",7,1,3,10 November 2006
Groundhog Day," Only Bill Murray could have pulled this off.
","We all have days that can be classified as 'do overs'.Bad days where everything that could have gone wrong,did.It's where the classic line 'I should have just stayed in bed' comes in.This film gives a new spin on 'do over' days by granting Bill Murray's character several do overs to a day he would not have necessarily chosen to do over again.The first do over is filled with the expected surprise and bafflement and as the day continues to repeat,you get the classic Bill Murray and the reactions you have come to know,love,and expect from him.His character,as a result,gradually grows into a better person.It's fun,and it shouldn't be missed.",8,0,2,24 October 2014
National Treasure," National Pleasure
","Despite a wildly far fetched story line,National Treasure was indeed a joy to watch.The whole concept of a modern day treasure hunt laced with 'clues' left nearly 250 years in the past was quite an intriguing idea to me,and going in,I was very hopeful not to be let down.I wasn't. It is discovered that a map leading to a wealth of treasure was placed on the back of our beloved Declaration of Independence.Bad guys are out to steal the document and find the treasure for themselves.Nicolas Cage must also set out to steal it in order to protect the treasure.What ensues is a great thrill ride from start to finish.Also,this is a great movie for an entire family to watch as violent content is at a minimum and there is virtually no profanity at all.When it becomes available for rental,I highly recommend it for family night.Pop some popcorn,sit back and enjoy the ride!",8,1,2,18 February 2005
Rocky," The ultimate underdog story and one of the best romances in cinema history.
","He was nothing.A club fighter going absolutely no where.He definitely had the talent,but not the heart,not the desire.Then,the impossible happens.He is virtually hand picked by the top of the heap,the heavyweight champion of the world.He is given an out of the blue,once in a lifetime opportunity to fight for it all,with little regard to just how much heart and desire he had deep within him.They would find out,wouldn't they? When we think of underdogs in the cinematic world,the first one we think of is Rocky Balboa.What also is appealing about the film is it's romantic side.Rocky's almost school boy like pursuit of Adrian makes you root for him not just in the ring but outside of it as well.This is not just the best underdog story in cinema history,it's also one of the sweetest love stories as well.",9,0,0,10 August 2007
Some Like It Hot," Hysterically funny!
","AFI calls this the funniest film ever made.While it is hilarious,I have watched films that made me laugh harder.I guess in the end,it is really about individual tastes.This is a well written,well executed comedy from top to bottom.Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are hysterically funny as the two main characters,that is,if you can take your eyes off of Marilyn long enough.She never looked lovelier.Jello on springs,indeed,Mr. Lemmon!The film also has some small elements of drama and violence.George Raft is at his dead level best as the mob boss in pursuit of our two fleeing main characters.All in all worthy of it's classic status.",9,1,2,25 October 2013
Pulp Fiction," Beyond Words
","This film is absolutely breath taking.It's unique approach to story telling and cinematography is just beyond words.I do admire films that dare to be different and stretch beyond the comfort zones of the typical movie lovers out there.It definitely deserves its place on the AFI's 100 greatest films.It's funny yet violent at the same time, and that is something I thought I would never see in a film.Definitely a must see,must rent,must own movie.Thumbs up!",10,0,1,12 February 2002
Titanic," Excellent blend of a fictional love story and real life tragedy
","I think that,as movie watchers,we all have at least one film that we wanted to like so much, that a disappointment would just be too much to handle.One such film for me was Titanic.Thankfully, it did not let me down,although the movie is not without it's imperfections.I'll talk about the great things first.Never has the ship been more masterfully recreated.I guess it took all this time to have the technology to do so.The special effects are indeed the best I have seen in any film.As for the acting, Billy Zane really steals the show from our two heroes,Leo and Kate,as the greedy,relentless Cal Hockley.Zane's performance is one of the better I have seen when it comes to villains.The recreation of the ship's final moments is spellbinding.The moment that touched my heart the most would have to be the 'Nearer My God to Thee' scene.You are not human if this moment does not touch you to some degree.The only complaint I have with this film is the use of humor in some questionable places,For example,as Rose is battling to free Jack from his handcuffs and rescue him from certain doom,he utters the line,'I'll wait right here'.I certainly don't think one liners would be appropriate in that situation,though some may disagree.Overall, this film is a great blend of fiction and real life,and if you can sit still for three hours,I definitely recommend it.",9,1,2,2 October 2001
The Happening," Nothing happened.
","If this film was supposed to be scary,I'm afraid it did not do it's proper job for me.The film is as dull,lifeless,and boring as I have ever seen a movie be.Shyamalan's work since that certain film about seeing dead people has unfortunately deteriorated over the last nine years and this is an unfortunate thing.Here is hoping that he can get back on track one day and give us a film worthy of our attention and will keep us talking about it for many years to come as he did with that one film.It's obvious he has the talent or else he would not have been able to impress us even once.Mr. Shyamalan,don't rush.Take some time off and take all the time you need to give us another classic.I am sure it would be well worth the wait.",3,0,2,22 September 2008
The Untouchables," 1930's style film making with an 1980's touch.Excellent!
","What I like about this film is the way it takes on the atmosphere of a film actually produced in the 1930's,yet is injected with the grittiness and violence of modern day to show what things were really like in the era of Al Capone.This is what gives the film a unique appeal.Al Capone ruled Chicago,but he no doubt saw himself as king of the world,and Robert De Niro does an excellent job of bringing this across in his role as Capone.Also excellent is Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness,Andy Garcia as Stone,and Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace.As excellent as all of these performances were,stealing the show from all of them is Sean Connery as Malone.It is in this film that Connery proved to us that he could be much more than that certain British super spy we all knew him as.His death scene is bar none the best I have ever seen in a film.Bar none!This is an excellent must see film!",9,0,2,1 December 2006
Mystic River," Eastwood reaches pinnacle of directorial success.
","Childhood friendships.Some of them last a lifetime,some diminish as time goes on because our friends take different paths in life.Mystic River takes us on a journey of three friends who fall in the latter circumstance.Their journey apart begins much earlier than expected when one of the boys is taken away by a child molester posing as a cop.Unthinkable and unspeakable things happen to him.Dave,the young victim,is of course hit the hardest among the three boys.Jimmy and Sean are affected as well,and the three boys are subconsciously driven apart by the incident.Dave leads a semi normal life,Sean goes into law enforcement,Jimmy dabbles in organized crime.Suddenly another tragedy brings the three former friends back together.Mystic River is not only a fine drama,but within it lies a good old fashioned murder mystery that will keep you riveted.This film represents Clint Eastwood's ultimate maturity as a director,and should not be missed.",9,3,6,23 November 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," If you haven't seen it,what are you waiting for?
","It's a Wonderful Life is another one of those films that has had so many good things said of it that it leaves you not knowing where to begin a review of your own.I won't spend a lot of time pointing out this film's good qualities because you have either seen it for yourself or you have heard it countless times.I will just say that if you have not seen it,you need to.Not only because it's a great film,but it's one of the best,if not the best acting performance Jimmy Stewart ever gave.He literally took his character from one aspect of life to another with an unbelievable deftness,from the typical guy next door charm that we already knew him for to the look of horror in his eyes when none of his family,friends,or neighbors knew him or recognized him.It was one of the first,if not the first time he ever showed his amazing versatility as an actor,and this could be the one film that made Alfred Hitchcock want to work with this man so much in the years that followed.And it has a happy ending!That's something we don't see often anymore in this 'Shades of gray' age we live in now.See it already!",10,0,7,29 December 2008
Die Hard," Top action film of the 1980's
","Every so often,a film comes along that resets the standard for it's genre.Die Hard did just that very thing for action films.Any film that inspires copycats and wannabes really does it's job well.Bruce Willis made a very successful transition from the small screen to the big screen as the everyday Joe forced into being the hero.This film has all the necessary ingredients to qualify it as a great action film.All you have to do is see it for yourself.Particularly well done is the performance of Alan Rickman as the chief villain,Hans Gruber.You can come up with good arguments for many action films as to which is the best all time,and this one is no exception.Well done.",8,111,190,17 May 2004
Psycho," What else can be said?
","This film is classic,inside and out.The top thriller of all cinematic time.I don't think any arguments can be made against that.This is indeed Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.I'm struggling for words here because I'm not sure I can say anything that anyone hasn't read a thousand times over.If you have not seen it,don't put it off any longer.You'll never close your eyes in the shower again.That is,if you don't decide to just take baths from now on.I mean,if a scene is done so effectively,that Janet Leigh herself refuses to go anywhere near a shower to this day,it just doesn't get any better than that,folks.Rent it! See it! This classic film should never be overlooked.",10,1,2,11 April 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," Great illustration of the real life quirky dating world.
","I'm not huge on romantic comedies,but have enjoyed a few,but the ones I have enjoyed tend to be the ones that stray from the usual stereotypes that you associate with them.This is an example.It's dialog is more intelligent and funny.This is thanks,in big part to Billy Crystal,who has always had a clever way with words.This was developed,no doubt by his years as a stand up comic..The film has all the right ingredients for a classic romantic comedy..A funny,charming guy,a lovely and funny lady,a great supporting cast,and a truthful illustration of how quirky romance and dating really is.The real dating world is simply good fodder for a good romantic comedy film.Not all of them have been done well,but this one was.",7,1,1,12 January 2015
War of the Worlds," Effective telling of the old story,but oh,those CGI's!
","This is a story that if told well,could be a very effective hide under the covers type of movie.After all,let's not forget that Orson Welles' radio telling of this same story scared a young nation nearly to death in 1938.This time,it is put in another pair of more than capable hands, Steven Spielberg.We can rest assured that he will stop at nothing to tell this familiar story to us as good as we know he can.He succeeds, throwing in a credible combo of father and daughter,Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning.There are alterations to the original story,but you won't mind.In fact,you may end up going,'Hey,that's a good idea,why didn't they do that before?'.All in all,this is,as I stated before,a very good hide under the covers flick.There's just one problem that I have with it, personally.Until they come up with computer graphics(or CGI's,as I hear they are called),that are a little more realistic looking,I am afraid I am going to be nothing but bothered by them.That being said,it is still an excellent film otherwise.",7,0,1,3 January 2006
All Quiet on the Western Front," Amazing and thought provoking.
","I was amazed by the graphic nature of this film,yet I suppose if you are going to produce a film that condemns war,you would want to drive the point home in the best way that you can.All Quiet on the Western Front succeeds at this with leaps and bounds.I found it incredible how a film from the early 1930's reminded me so much of a much more recent war classic,Saving Private Ryan.For example,the soldier who was obsessed with having his dead friend's boots because he needed some to replace the ones he had which made him feel miserable.He obtains them,marching into battle with a comfortable smile on his face,only to be killed almost immediately.This reminds me so much of the soldier from SPR who had a hole shot in his helmet as it rested on his head,who was taken out seconds later as he talked about how lucky he was.All Quiet is an amazing,ahead of it's time,thought provoking film.",Null,0,0,17 July 2011
To Kill a Mockingbird," Best courtroom drama ever!
","A courtroom drama is a courtroom drama,but you would be hard pressed to find one better than this classic.It is well played from top to bottom.We were on the doorstep of the Civil Rights movement in the early 60's when this film was produced and released,and it no doubt helped move things along in the cause.Gregory Peck is in the top of his form as Atticus Finch,and he is supported well,particularly by Brock Peters as the wrongly accused Tom Robinson,and young Mary Badham as Scout.It's a pity we didn't see her more often in more roles.Just my opinion,but this is quite simply the best courtroom drama ever made.A must see.",10,0,2,19 April 2013
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A rather odd story,but entertaining
","I thoroughly enjoy this film,though I find it to be a rather odd story.Looking at it realistically,I find it hard to believe that a British commander,or any other commander,would give in to the will of the enemy under any circumstances,but I realize that even films based on true events can never be told 100% accurately,so I have no problem seeing as a great fictionalized account of true events.All the performances were excellent,particularly those of Alec Guiness and Bill Holden.If you are looking for a different type of war story,you have a winner in this one,but I would advise not reading up on how things really happened on The River Kwaiuntil after viewing it.It may make the film a disappointment to you.",8,1,2,8 May 2013
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Psychological warfare.
","I like this film's display of the psychological war between the characters portrayed by Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson represents a somewhat bad seed who becomes a hero to the mental patients he joins through a successful attempt to avoid hard labor.Fletcher is Nurse Ratched,a hard nosed and power hungry woman whose actions make her look more like a warden than a nurse.Nicholson soon has his fellow patients experiencing life and feeling better,although perhaps not quite to the point of being cured.Nurse Ratched,with seemingly no interest in the betterment of the patients,but rather seems more interested in keeping them ill to maintain her control over them,sees Nicholson as a threat.The battle is a thing of beauty to watch.",8,0,1,7 October 2013
Con Air," Far fetched,but likable.
","The plot of this film is about as far fetched as you can get,and Nick Cage's southern accent is a bit over the top,yet I find Con Air to be enjoyable nonetheless.We have Cage as a dedicated husband/military man coming home to his 'hummingbird',played by Monica Potter,and finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.He accidentally kills a man while defending her and finds himself doing a stretch in prison.He does his time and is released.On his way home to his wife and his baby girl,who is now walking and talking yet he has never met her,he is forced to ride alongside the most hardened,frightening group of convicts you can imagine as they are being transported to a brand new facility.This group is headed by a very convincing John Malkovich as a deranged killer with a frighteningly high Hannibal Lecter like intelligence,and boy does he have something up his sleeve!It is an enjoyable story of hardened men struggling to gain freedom that they don't deserve,and one unlikely con's struggle to get home to his girls.",7,1,2,8 February 2008
Jaws," My most vivid theater memory
","I can still recall sitting in the theater,10 years old.The screen is black.You then hear the rustling of water.Slowly,the music begins.It begins to quicken.It's coming to get us!This man eating machine they call 'Jaws'.I think in many ways,this film perhaps gave sharks a worse name than they really deserve,but this in no way keeps it from being a great film.This is indeed a thrill ride from beginning to end,with a laugh or two mixed in to give our hearts a rest.The late Robert Shaw is excellent as Quint,the cranky,seaworthy captain.Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss(one of my all time favorite actors) turn in great performances here,as well.Before going to the beach,give this film a look,and see if you don't change your mind.",10,1,3,20 September 2001
Kingpin," Somewhat bizarre and off the wall,but it has it's moments
","This is perhaps the most unusual comedy film I've ever seen,but I've always said that uniqueness is a good quality in a film.I mean,who else would have thought this up?The story is unique,Randy Quaid and Woody Harrelson use their comic skills to perfection,and it's definitely good for more than one laugh.The humor is somewhat raunchy at times,but hey,funny is funny.The 'Indecent Proposal' gag is a complete riot,with Harrelson poking a little fun at a past role.This is by no means a classic comedy,but it's good for basic laughs,and if you are looking for a good comedy to add to your comedy section at home,you'll do OK with this one.",6,0,1,7 March 2002
Ray," Foxx gives a perfect portrayal of an imperfect genius.
","In all the films I have seen that have been based on the lives of real people,this film about the life of Ray Charles now tops the list of my personal favorites.Jamie Foxx portrays Ray with absolute perfection.The portrayals of his perfect musical genius,as well as his imperfect personal life are solid as a rock and Foxx is very well deserving of his Oscar nomination.Anything short of a win would be outrageous.Having enjoyed Ray's music all of my life,I,along with any other fan,certainly did not want to be disappointed with any film on his life story.The film impresses this Ray Charles fan with flying colors.You will come away appreciating his triumphs over personal tragedies and struggles on his way to becoming the musical genius he was.Thumbs way up!",10,1,2,4 February 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Oh to go back in time.
","It goes without saying that we have come a long way technically when it comes to animated feature films,but the thing I appreciate about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the fact that prior to it's 1937 release,audiences had seen nothing like it.If time travel were possible,I would go back and sit amongst that first lucky audience that was fortunate enough to see this.It would have made it that much more enjoyable.Kids today are spoiled by technical advances,so the animation most likely won't impress them,but they will be drawn in by it's story alone.I have a 6 year old daughter who loves this film,and even though Walt has been gone from this earth for a long time now,he is somewhere smiling at the fact that after 70 plus years,Snow White is still making kids of all ages smile.",9,2,2,30 October 2010
The Lion King," My son loves it,therefore I love it
","This is a great story,with excellent voice casting and the usual great animation we have come to expect from Disney.The only possible problem I have with this film would be the final fight scene with Simba and Scar.This is somewhat disturbing and a little too excessive and violent for my taste.Most importantly, my 2 year old son loves this film,and whatever my son loves, naturally I am going to love too.Throw in an excellent score by Tim Rice and Elton John (my childhood hero),and you can chalk up another classic for the folks at Disney.",8,1,4,6 January 2002
The Waterboy," Another silly but genuinely funny outing from Sandler
","Adam Sandler's brand of humor may not be award winning,but it doesn't have to be.He creates another memorable character here,and surrounds himself with a good cast,including Henry Winkler,and Oscar winner Kathy Bates.You would be hard pressed to find a film about the sport of football that could be considered a great one,but the majority that I have seen are entertaining enough,and this one is no exception to that. If you are smart,you won't view this movie with an expectation of greatness,but if you want genuinely funny silliness,this is a film for you.It's a worthy edition to the comedy section of anyone's home library.",6,24,41,3 October 2002
WALL·E," The beauty of romance amongst the ugly aspects of life.
","I like to think of this film as a documentation,although animated,of just how lazy we are getting as a society.We are working ourselves to a point of just not even having to get out of bed in the morning.The man on the hover chair who fell out of it and just laid there like he didn't know what to do to get himself up is an example of that..It's ironic,really.We are trying so hard to take all of the work out of life because we think it makes it easier,but the truth is,we're killing ourselves slowly.Just my opinion.I love our little robotic hero and the romance story that evolves in the middle of all of the ugliness that surrounds them.Worthy of a place on the DVD shelf.",8,0,1,27 June 2014
The Blind Side," Football is only a part of the story.
","Another run of the mill football flick? I think not.In fact,football is a small part of the overall package with this film.The real story is about this family and how they took in a young man who didn't have a home or a penny to his name and gave him,through their kindness and generosity,a home and a life.When we do things such as these,we are doing what God does.I have always been a sucker for a good football flick,but I'm an even bigger one for stories of people giving of themselves to other people.Also (and I don't make it a habit of saying things like this),but Sandra Bullock never looked lovelier in a film as she does here.Buy it for those times that you need spiritual uplifting.",9,0,5,21 November 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," 'Prison is no fairy tale world.'
","I never fail to be captivated by this film when I watch it.This,indeed, is no run of the mill prison flick.It is really not a prison movie at all.True,it takes place in a prison,but it is really a story about what lies beyond the prison walls;freedom itself.Some within the prison walls crave it,desire it.Others fear it,simply because prison has become their home,and freedom would remove them from their comfort zone.This is a sad reality made all too clear,here.This is also a story of hope and tenacity.You find yourself looking at the film's main character, Andy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins),and you find yourself wanting to have as much smarts,and tenacity as he does.You also find yourself looking at Andy's close friend,Ellis 'Red' Redding (played with flawless perfection,as always,by Morgan Freeman),and wanting to go back and correct all the stupid things you did when you were young. You look at Brooks (James Whitmore) and you are saddened to realize that having been imprisoned so long,that he is doomed,never to fit in,in this ever rapidly changing world.Being released,in fact,becomes a worse hell than being incarcerated in the first place.There are many individual characters to look at from different angles,and this is what makes Shawshank a great film.Don't miss it.",10,0,1,10 April 2002
Platoon," Blows away all previous imaginings of the horrors of war.
","You have to be a true veteran of war to understand the horrors of it.Those of us who are not veterans of war have to rely on those who were there to tell the story.You have those who can verbally describe it,which gets the imagination going,but never quite enough.Then,you have someone like Oliver Stone,who has the power to recreate visually based on his own point of view.He was there,and he tells us through this Oscar winning film that this is what it looked like from his point of view.He wants us to see what he saw,for that is the only way for those of us who weren't there to understand what our fighting men went through.Imagination alone won't do it.Though I understand that you still had to be there to get the full grasp,thanks to Oliver Stone,now I understand a lot better.",8,0,2,16 May 2007
Despicable Me," Good exists even in the most evil of hearts.
","It's funny how you avoid certain movies for while simply because you get a somewhat bad vibe from the previews that tells you that you probably wouldn't enjoy it.It happens to me a lot.Very often,I come around to finally giving it a chance.Sometimes my initial premonition turns out to be correct,and then there are a few films,such as in the case of Despicable Me,where I end up being pleasantly surprised.In the character of Gru,we see a 'villain' seemingly bent on world domination.We get some insight on why he became evil in the first place,then we see him get sidetracked by three adorable little girls.Then,slowly but surely,some goodness bubbles to the surface as he realizes that he has a chance to give to these three children what he never received as a child.Love.A very sweet,evil story.",9,1,1,23 December 2013
Raging Bull," He flew high and crashed and burned on the same inner demons.
","Jake LaMotta unleashed a raging tiger whenever he stepped into a boxing ring,and it won him acclaim.That same raging tiger broke free of the cage that contained it a few times too often and proceeded to devour his personal life.Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career as LaMotta.Raging Bull is a gritty and dark story of a man who flew high on his own inner demons,yet crashed and burned on those same demons.The black and white cinematography suits the story well,and Joe Pesci leads an excellent supporting cast.It's too dark and violent a story for me to visit often,but nonetheless it is a well done piece of film making.",8,2,2,27 August 2013
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the top acting performances ever!
","Anthony Hopkins gives the performance of his career,not to mention one of the best ever.I rank it second only Dustin Hoffman's acting performance in Rain Man.Not since Bela Lugosi's turn in 1931's Dracula has there been such an intimidating presence on screen. The stare,the mannerisms,the 'I just might come out of here and get you' personality displayed here was enough,and still is enough to make my blood curdle when I view it.This film is gory,it is disturbing,but it is excellent in every since of the word.Bravo to everyone involved,and this one should take a prominent place in the thriller section of anyone's home library.",9,1,2,16 January 2002
Vanilla Sky," A confusing,head spinning mess!
","Well,at the least the previews did their job of luring people in to see the film,my wife and I included.This is one film where the cover of the book is more entertaining than the story within.A big name cast is totally wasted here in this confusing mess of a movie.The plot twists and turns slowly build to the point of making the movie goer flee from the theater,pulling their hair and screaming with madness.I believe that there is such a thing as too many thrills in a film,and Vanilla Sky has become the best example of this to me.Trust me,if you want to keep your sanity,for Pete's sake, stay away from this movie.",Null,0,1,27 February 2002
Tombstone," Most compelling version of an often told story.
","I must confess that I never expect much from Kurt Russell as an actor, but when it comes to the often played role of the legendary Wyatt Earp, I taken aback at how well he came across.Russell gave the role a tough, grittiness that in my opinion is quite effective.For my taste,it is the best portrayal of Earp I have seen,which is quite a compliment considering the Hollywood heavyweights that have tackled the role in the past.Equally impressive is the performance of Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.He exuded an undeniable charm here.Upon viewing recently for the first time in many years,I discovered an impressive amount of actors who would go on to bigger roles later.A pre Sling Blade Billy Bob Thornton,a pre Titanic Billy Zane,Thomas Haden Church,just to name a few.Performances aside,this is the most compelling presentation of this often told story.",8,0,1,18 June 2005
Blade Runner," Brilliant Futuristic Film Noir.
","Blade Runner is a very violent film,and normally I deduct points for violence depending on the level of it,but with Blade Runner,there is an element which restores those lost points and even adds new ones.Blade Runner is a brilliant film noir with a futuristic twist.The film's musical soundtrack and Harrison Ford's brilliant narration are what make it so.It is well casted starting with Ford,and a rousing hat's off is due to Rutger Hauer for his performance as one of the most intimidating villains I have ever seen in a film.I understand there is an alternate director's cut which excludes Ford's narration and takes on an entirely different tone.I have not as yet seen it,and perhaps I need to,but it's hard to imagine being as impressed with that version as I am with the theatrical release.It's great stuff.",8,1,2,21 October 2008
Ben-Hur," Cinema excellence.
","This telling of the many trials and tribulations of Judah Ben-Hur is indeed one of my favorite classic films.Watching it makes me wish I had been around to see it on the big screen back in the day.The story is quite captivating.He is forced to stand against a man who was a childhood friend that he loved dearly.He takes the blame for his own family in an incident against a Roman governor that was nothing more than an accident,and is forced into slavery by that former friend.Somehow he perseveres,ultimately becoming an adopted son of the consul from the very ship on which he was enslaved,and sets out to find his family,as well as the friend who betrayed them.I have always admired those who take the time,money and effort to bring bible stories,or stories based on the bible to life on the big screen,and William Wyler did an outstanding job with Ben-Hur,as did Charlton Heston and everyone else involved.With it's 11 Academy Awards,it's obvious that Hollywood very smartly thought so as well.Let me not close without mentioning the still talked about chariot race,which is often called the best action sequence in cinema history.I haven't seen every action sequence ever filmed,but it is indeed hard to believe anyone can top that.Excellent film.",9,1,3,2 March 2008
Casino Royale," Different,yet still enjoyable.
","Forget the familiarities.What we have here is an interesting blend of old and new.Casino Royale was Ian Fleming's very first James Bond novel,yet had never been made into a movie.Not a serious one anyway.The setting is modern day,yet the story goes way back to James Bond's earliest days as a 00.If you are going to begin anew with the series,it would be smart to have a new face in place.Daniel Craig is that new face.While Craig is somewhat lacking the charm of his predecessors,he brings a fresh new perspective to the role.The action is much more raw,gritty,and violent,yet it is still enjoyable.Don't be looking around for Moneypenny and Q,their not around,which may disappoint long time fans of the series.In my opinion,our old friend has a fresh new look.Traditionalists may not like the idea,but if they give it a chance,they may just be pleasantly surprised.",7,0,2,26 March 2007
Bull Durham," All the fun of a night out at the ballpark injected into a film.
","There's something to be said about Minor League Baseball.While the Major Leagues have their glitz and glamor,the minor leagues are a bit different.It's not so glitzy.It's not so glamorous.Everything having to do with the minor leagues happens on a much smaller scale.For some,like me,the atmosphere of the minors is much more appealing because you don't have a bunch of millionaires out there saying 'look what I can do'.What you do have are guys trying to prove themselves worthy of that next step,the Major League level,which means that they are more likely to be giving their all.Minor league ballparks,depending upon which ones you go to,have a lot to offer as far as fun things to do for the family as far as contests and the like.What Bull Durham does for the average movie watcher is project that very atmosphere that I have just described.When you watch the film,you feel like you are at the ballpark having a blast.The three way interaction between the characters played by Costner,Robbins,and Sarandon is a great display of artistry that no one should miss.There are elements of language and sexuality that some may find offensive as well as slams against Christianity that made me personally uneasy,but otherwise this film is a definite fun time.",8,9,19,4 September 2007
The Deer Hunter," Some bonds go deeper than others.
","At it's very core,The Deer Hunter is a basic story of friendship and how some bonds go deeper than others.The film makes you look at your own friendships and wonder to yourself just how far you would go for those that you call friends.Here you have six men,who without being mushy or saying the words out loud,love each other very much.They have their spats from time to time,but all friends do.They love their friends and they love their country,and are willing to fight to the death for both.Three of these friends enlist in the army with the intention of doing just that.They face the hell that was Vietnam for their friends and their country.Two return,one is AWOL and they are forced to leave him behind.One,out of love,returns to find his friend and bring him home.Do you have friends like that?Love De Niro,love Chris Walken,love Meryl Streep.The Deer Hunter is great dramatic cinema.",9,0,2,1 August 2007
Speed," One of the best action films ever!
","If ever there was a film I wished I had seen at the theater,this would be the one.It's a great combination of a well written story, great direction,and a great cast.It's one of those films that you want to like so much,and it does not disappoint.The only thing that bothered me about the film is perhaps is the insertion of ill timed corny remarks ('He lost his head'),and the ending could have been done better,but overall a great action film worth owning.",8,96,124,31 October 2001
The Sixth Sense," It had me fooled and I love that
","This film exudes intelligence on a level I have never seen before.Either you are smart enough to figure out what is going on,or you are completely fooled,which I am ashamed to say I was.When it comes to trying to fool people,bad films usually fail,good ones succeed.This film falls into the latter category by a mile.Bruce Willis gives us a fine performance here,definitely among his better efforts.Haley Joel Osment gives the finest effort from a child actor ever,as Cole,a boy tormented by disturbing and very macabre visions.There is not much to say here without giving most of the plot away,so you will just have to see for yourself.Look for a much thinner,barely recognizable Donnie Wahlberg in a very brief but frightening role.Thumbs up!",9,1,2,5 July 2002
The Producers," Wall to wall insanity!
","The Producers is one of those comedies where if you blink,you most likely will miss something.Just the kind you would expect when viewing the earliest works of Mel Brooks,in particular those works that involve Gene Wilder in his prime.The Producers is wall to wall insanity,just one ridiculous action and word after another,and if you love comedy in it's truest form,you will not cease to be entertained here.Oddly,as much as I love Mel's work in the 70's (Blazing Saddles,Young Frankenstein,High Anxiety,etc),this was my first ever viewing of this film,and I can't for the life of me figure out why it took me so long.All I can say is that it was well worth the wait.",8,1,2,23 January 2015
Flight," Denzel's performance the glue in an otherwise flat,lengthy story.
","Although it seemed a bit lengthy and seemed to wander a bit too much in directions that made it hard for me to stay interested,I really enjoyed Denzel Washington's performance as demon battling airline pilot Whip Whitaker.Denzel never fails to impress in anything.He's that good.His performance of the main character is what kept me going.I cared about what happened to him and was hoping the ultimate outcome of the film was a suitable one.Thankfully it was.There are no more real highlights to brag about here.As I said,the film otherwise ran a little too long and went into some areas that made the story fall flat.Thumbs up for Denzel.",6,1,1,27 December 2013
Rear Window," Oh,the many reasons I love it.
","I love Rear Window for many reasons.I am already biased to the work of both Jimmy Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock.Jimmy Stewart was simply one of the best actors to grace Hollywood,and to see him under the direction of the ultimate master of suspense is awesome.I love it for Grace Kelly.Her beauty was mesmerizing and Hitchcock's use of it in this film leaves a guy falling in love.To me,a film doesn't need to be blatantly sexual.Undertones are good enough for me,and with Grace Kelly,I come away from this film feeling much the same way as many men do after they have watched the actresses of today going over the top sexually.I love the fact that the film did not have to go far geographically.We never left Jimmy Stewart's apartment.Our view was pretty much his view throughout.To top it off,the film includes the single best moment of suspense ever,in my book.That moment when Raymond Burr's character discovers what Stewart,Kelly,and company are up to,slowly looking upward in Stewart's (and our) direction! Simply Chilling. Ultimate suspense classic.",9,0,1,18 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Though not as fresh and eye opening today,it's still a great film.
","This film came along at just the right time for me.Upon it's initial release in 1977,I was 12 years old,which is the perfect age to see something this eye opening and different.I remember sitting and watching with just as much awe and amazement as perhaps 12 year olds from past generations seeing their first cowboy movie.I remember the thrills as though I saw it fresh yesterday.Upon seeing it again recently for the first time in many years,now well into my adulthood,I find,unfortunately,that the thrill that came with my first viewing did not come with me across the years.Despite this fact,I still saw a great film,one worthy of any home library.It's suspenseful,thrilling,and contains a great story line and interesting characters that we care about.It was great looking back on Harrison Ford when his hair wasn't quite so gray,Mark Hamill,whom we all thought would go on to be a great film star,though he has done little beyond this trilogy,Carrie Fisher, and,at least in voice,James Earl Jones(Darth Vader).Though the initial childhood thrill is gone,this is still a great film.",9,56,111,13 March 2005
Click," Almost a new Sandler favorite,but not quite.
","Based on the story idea I got from the previews,I really wanted this film to be my new favorite Adam Sandler movie.While it is good,I find that it contains some material that is objectionable in my opinion,therefore I had to deduct points for it,making fall just short of the 'new favorite' status.What did I find objectionable? Toilet humor is something that I am a fan of,and there is a major moment of this between Sandler and co star David Hasselhoff.Also,the idea of a dog getting frisky with a stuffed animal is not something I find humorous.Thirdly,I find something disturbing about the tormenting of the kid next door,despite the fact that some feel it was justified.These three elements could have been eliminated,and you still would have had a good film.All of that aside,I found the story to be very funny and touching,not to mention well executed.The special effects are also worthy of note,here.In short,this will take it's place in the number two slot among my Sandler favs,just under The Wedding Singer.Thumbs up to Chris Walken and Kate Beckinsale in their supporting roles.I like it!",8,1,4,2 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," On even par with it's predecessor.
","We cared about the characters,and we were compelled by their story enough to go back and see what was going to happen next.We were not disappointed.It equaled the thrills of the original(Episode IV if you will).We once again felt the thrills of traveling through space at insane speeds.We laughed at the comic relief of C3PO and R2D2.We are at first angry with Lando when he betrays his friends,but the anger switches to Darth Vader,making us hate him even more,when we realize that Lando had no choice in the matter.We cheer,yet are concerned,when Luke has his showdown with Vader,and are taken aback at what we learn at the end of the fight.This film,much like it's predecessor,did all that it was supposed to do,for us,the moviegoers,emotionally,placing it on even par with the previous film.In short,it's good,not only as a sequel,but as an individual film,as well.Thumbs up.",8,0,2,19 June 2005
The Wedding Singer," To date,Sandler's best work.
","I've said it before,Adam Sandler does not do great films.He merely wants to entertain us.Though there are times when he has failed miserably,this is not the case with The Wedding Singer.While it does showcase Sandler's usual juvenile humor,this is by far his most likable character,even to date,and the chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore is undeniable. Though this film is not flawless by any means,it is funny and charming just the same.",7,46,64,22 June 2004
The Pursuit of Happyness," It will make you want to better yourself,for you and your children.
","I have often heard that a sad fact about humanity is that when we as individuals reach what we feel to be our capacity in life,we most often stop trying to better ourselves.Then,there are those rare individuals that wake up one day and come to the realization that there is,in fact,something better out there,and that if we want it,it's not going to come knock on our door.We have to go get it.This is merely one lesson that this film teaches us.The other lesson is how to be the best possible parents we can possibly be to our children and setting the best possible example we can set.I love the story this film tells.I like the already existing chemistry between Will and Jaden Smith being displayed for us in a fictional story.The fact that they are father and son in reality really helped them tell this story in the best possible way.See it.It will inspire you to be a better you and a better parent.",9,2,3,12 November 2007
Back to the Future," As close as you can get to a perfect movie
","I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,'Back to the Future' comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the 'Twin Pines Mall'.Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see.",10,15,19,16 September 2001
Goodfellas," Good performances,but I'm not a fan of the genre.
","I will begin by stating that I am not a fan of the mafia genre.I am merely watching and reviewing this film because of it's status as the #94 film on the American Film Institute's top 100 films in cinema history.I will give high marks to the cast,Robert DeNiro,Joe Pesci,Ray Liotta,Paul Sorvino,and Lorraine Bracco for their performances,as they play these types of roles very well,especially DeNiro and Pesci.I just don't connect very well with mafia story lines,as I feel that they only serve to glorify the real mafia.I will not question any of the AFI's choices for best films ever,but as a matter of personal taste,I have to say that I just don't like the film as a whole,and will probably never view it again.",5,6,15,16 September 2006
Cinderella Man," He rose from his knees to become King of the mountain.
","Boxing films.It seems like we have seen at least a thousand of them.The boxing matches all seem to go the same way.Punches that in reality only take seconds are slowed down to what seems like a full minute.We are used to seeing this.So to be impressive,a boxing film would have to have a strong side story.This one has that.James J.Braddock was a boxer,and at least to some degree,a cocky one.Suddenly,injuries and the Great Depression drove him to the depths of despair.He was suddenly fighting an opponent much tougher than any he had faced in the ring:poverty.Struggling to keep his family warm and fed wore him down more than any boxing match could.Suddenly,the powers that be gave him a second chance,not expecting anything less than failure.His despair made him a tougher fighter than he had ever been in the past,and before the shocked faces of everyone who wrote him off,he becomes king of the mountain.I like this movie.I love the performances and the story the film tells.Much of it is fictionalized.I have heard and read the many criticisms of director Ron Howard's portrayal of champion Max Baer as a vicious,bloodthirsty monster,and if the people who knew him,particularly his son,Max Baer,Jr.,say that this is inaccurate,I will buy that and just chalk it up to the fact that this is Hollywood,where reality is thrown out of the window most of the time for the sake of entertaining an audience.When the smoke from all of that clears,at the very core of this film is perhaps the greatest comeback story of all time.",8,1,1,23 April 2007
Beetlejuice," A bright comedic talent shines in a dark setting.
","I hardly find death or the afterlife even mildly amusing,but what strikes me as entertaining about Beetlejuice is it's star,Michael Keaton.This one time stand up comic was apparently,unbeknownst to us the public at the time,was on the threshold of breaking free,at least somewhat,from the solely comedic roles that we had come to know him for and taking on more dramatic and challenging roles.Little did we know just how versatile he is.At any rate,Beetlejuice is the best showcase,I think,of Keaton's early comedic talent.It is with that comedic talent that he shined a little light in the dark world that we associate with the film's director,Tim Burton.I would shield the kids from this film until they are older because of it's content and language,but it's an enjoyable ride for adults.",8,1,2,5 November 2008
All the President's Men," The most dialog rich thriller ever
","Thriller films have become a dime a dozen over the years,but how many of them rely so heavily and are so rich in dialog? I am sure there are others,but this has to be the best of the bunch.The best part is that the people and events depicted are very real and were still pretty fresh on our minds at the time.The ink had barely dried on the paper at the time,it seems to me.I was very young at the time and didn't understand it all until years later.It's obvious that all involved worked very hard on this film and didn't pull any punches.It plays like a thriller and is just as worthy of your time as anything Hitchcock ever made,hands down.",Null,3,4,31 July 2011
The Wizard of Oz," In a word,flawless!
","If ever there was a perfect film,this would be the one.I have loved this film since childhood,and it seems to get better with age.It contains wonderful special effects and cinematography, especially since film making was still in it's infancy at the time.The mixture of black and white and color is a very unique quality,adding more to the films appeal.Children may be a little frightened by the flying monkeys,as I was when I first saw them,so perhaps some parental discretion should be used if your young children are easily frightened.It definitely goes without saying that this is a great film,and,like fine wine,it only gets better with age.",10,4,7,6 January 2002
From Here to Eternity," Well done cinema classic.
","Occasionally before viewing a film for the first time,I peek into the special features section of the DVD.This is what I did with From Here to Eternity,and I found out some surprising things.There are 'first choices' when it comes to film roles,and the only first choice that ended up in their respective role was Burt Lancaster.No one felt that Montgomery Clift fit the role of the boxer,but the director persisted and got him anyway.Deborah Kerr and Frank Sinatra,according to the same people,also did not fit their roles but were brought in anyway.The director was taking a gamble and he knew it.It paid off.When it comes down to it,it didn't seem to matter who the first choices were,a great film resulted anyhow and made 8 well deserved Oscars to boot.Great film.",Null,1,2,28 August 2011
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Charming recall of days past.
","What we have here,is a charming fictional story with a much more wholesome period in American history as it's backdrop.Though I personally was not around in the 1930's,it's clear that the Coen Brothers remained as true to the depression era south as they possibly could.Also worthy of note is the film's soundtrack.The music is beautifully placed in the film,and is such a prominent part of the overall film that it can almost be considered an additional cast member. It contains songs that came from the heart of the songwriters,rather than board rooms filled with greedy record executives.Very enriching. The cast was excellent,with nearly flawless performances across the board.The only trouble with the film in my view is the depiction of cruelty to animals,which I am always against.Setting that aside,I have no doubt that this will be regarded as one the great films of the new century.",8,0,2,8 January 2005
The Godfather," A dark world sprinkled with moments of beauty.
","It captures a dark world,at it's darkest and most violent,yet there are moments of beauty sprinkled throughout.This is what I enjoyed about The Godfather.I'm not a huge fan of mafia themed films,but I will give this film credit for presenting it with such realism.We get lost in it's realities and we forget often throughout the film that it is,in fact just a movie and that it is all play acting.I was wowed by how well casted it was and how well suited for their characters each actor was,in particular Marlon Brando.For all of it's dark theme and violent content,The Godfather still manages to come out looking like a true masterpiece.",8,1,2,18 December 2013
