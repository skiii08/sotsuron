First Man," Painfully Average Account of an American Legend
","When I find myself analyzing a film on it's first watch through - scrutinizing every detail: the good and the not so good... that is not a good sign. There are few people as easy to immerse into a movie than myself, as long as a movie is entertaining.Here we have an amazing subject, who lived a very singular, heroic life - and we the audience get to spend 1/2 this movie in domestic situations? Often without the main character present? How dumb is that?I know I should never want something from a film, specifically - so that when it does not deliver, I may ignore a movies actual merit. But come on! This isn't rocket science! Well... it is literally, but figuratively? Tell an exciting story about an exciting guy! When did he become a pilot? How many aircraft did he fly? How many times did he cheat death? How about actually focusing on his greatest achievement... the title of the film... and show how he was the tip of the spear, a main player in this technological expanse of our nation!This movie comes off thinking an audience member would be more interested when Armstrong met his wife?!? How dumb is that?If Neil Armstrong was so stoic, calculated and... dull - perhaps taking such a literal/grounded approach to his character was a mistake! But I learned something? Really? This must be one of the worst arguments for a feature length motion picture - if a film doesn't entertain, any unloading of information is irrelevant.From a production standpoint, this isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. The special effects crew should be really pleased with their work (in about 5% of the movie, when you can actually see what is going on). The effects have a retro look that fits the style of the film, yet a clarity and resolution that is quite beautiful to behold. So... lets put the camera 2 inches from the characters face in the most intense sequences that could utilized for wonderful special effects... How dumb is that? Yea, as a viewer, I want to look at a shaking helmet for 10 strait minutes instead of seeing exterior views of an intense event. Actually? I don't.It's funny, thinking back - this movie actually makes me angrier now than when I was watching it. First Man is well made, and I was kinda into it, like I said, fully analyzing everything when viewing, instead of being lost in the experience, like any good director would prefer. Now? I'm just amazed by a series of choices the film makers made to hold this project back: script emphasizing domestic life, action sequences highlighted by incomprehensible close ups and clattering noise, and portraying the hero as a stoic, math head. I left this film, somehow caring less about these events than more - I had to do some reading and watching of interviews on youtube to rekindle my fascination and interest in the man. And that is pathetic. In this way, for me - this movie is a disgrace.Well made movie that made a lot of baffling choices: 4/10 - actually? I enjoyed this film less that that.",4,1,5,3 January 2019
War Dogs," Formulaic with few redeeming qualities
","Shiftless dreamer (Miles Teller) with hot girlfriend paints himself into a corner financially. In need of a lifeline, a mysterious old friend (Jonah) shows up out of nowhere. Jonah plays Efraim, who is a shady commodities broker specializing in government contracts and weapons. With this type of partnership what could go wrong? Hijinks ensues. Morality becomes an issue. Friendship? All goes to hell, plus a tack on ending.Any seasoned mediaphile knows exactly where this movie is headed 10 minutes in, and very few surprises interfere with this predictable journey.Whether the formulaic story was present in 'from actual events', or the fictionalization of them, that I can not tell you. I understand that this is one of those truth is stranger than fiction type of accounts - but that doesn't mean it will make a good movie!While the story of this film may belong to Teller, this film is without question a Jonah Hill vehicle. His performance could have saved this movie, but it doesn't. As a viewer were supposed to buy into his chameleon like ability to become what other people want. He's supposed to be a sociopath con artist, but really he just comes across as an overweight, obnoxious lout with an annoying laugh. This is enforced by an absurd look and equally off putting vocabulary. I believe in Jonah as an actor, so I'm going to blame everyone else (writer/director) for building a bad character. Jonah simply followed through as part of the project. But this is equally mystifying because of the one gem in this film: Bradley Cooper. His smarmy, red eyed take on an international criminal on a US terrorist watch list... is glorious to behold. Also completely squandered with about 5 total minutes of screen time... So what happened with Jonah? I don't know. Unfortunate, because if his character was believable, this movie would have received a huge upgrade.I'd say this is a pretty good movie for Teller, his character isn't asked to do much heavy lifting acting wise, but he is acceptable as the strait guy pulled into a bizarre world of war economics.Solid production values as well - and really this was a pretty complex movie with all the locations. Very clean, and I appreciated the audio work as well. Good night club scene, with a funny cameo by Vegas legend (& most interesting man in the world candidate) Dan BilzerianPredictably (again) this movie gets off to pretty good start, but the second things stop being fun the movie runs into pacing issues, and truly falls on its face in terms of entertainment. By the end your really glad its over, and will probably wonder like me... was five minutes of excellent acting by Bradley Cooper really worth it?needless film that neither educates nor entertains, and fails to make good use of the talent - 4 out of 10",4,3,8,14 November 2016
Fury," nothing worse than an omen read wrong
","Fury is not a realistic war movie. Fury contains palpable violence, diverse characters, and a series of gut wrenching scenes, ending with an astonishing body count. A great deal of the death may not illicit desired empathy and consequences, but for the characters fleshed out the audience gets to experience the finality of a violent end. Who thinks this a heroic movie? These are not heroes! Brad Pitt's character is scared both mentally and physically, and is appropriately out of place as a tank commander. Who chooses to be a killer? None of the characters in this film, and this is so much of the point of this fable, story, and movie. This is war, and war as hell. Glory? No! A point? Absolutely! This movie has something to say, and is crafted as such by developing film maker David Ayer - one of my personal favorite writer/directors currently making big budget American films. David borrows heavily from a wonderful (and apparently forgotten) author from the past: Jack London. Pitt is Wolf Larson, with his disguised brilliance beneath the grime and camouflage of the cynical, brow beaten soldier. Logan Lerman, the child like recruit Norman Ellison, serves as the audiences entry into the war torn tank, Fury. An inanimate object, but also character within the film. Fury is confined, simplistic, and an effective film. Nothing is hidden, yet the baggage brought in through expectation has, apparently, changed the obvious for many viewers. 7 out of 10",7,0,3,24 December 2014
The Maze Runner," It's called the Maze Runner for goodness sakes!
","Begin with the title - The Maze Runner... There is not enough running, not enough of the maze, and even when it gets there: the maze running isn't that good. What is good? The acting surprisingly! Which means the directing isn't that bad. All characters really sell their respective parts, and the casting could be much worse. But the script is terrible. As interesting as the opening is, and it is only kinda intriguing, the story unfolds in a series of predictable and cliché turns... until the end. The conclusion includes the impossible, as in an actual impossible encounter (anyone else notice?)... then an open ending that (as far as I can tell) is not foreshadowed in any meaningful way. While not overly violent - there is an astonishing amount of death, but almost none of it carries any weight, except when the cliché death must occur... and it is predictably not a very good moment in the film. I only recommend this film to media addicts like myself, who will get something from this movie - fresh faced youngsters giving it their all. With a better pen and typewriter this could have been a solid film, but it is only slightly better than trash - and it's current rating around 7 is not earned - it is stolen by use of pandering to the masses.",4,0,1,11 December 2014
The Hateful Eight," Ax to Grind
","I'm not a big fan of Quentin Tarantino. I feel the best movie he was a large part of is True Romance, a movie he did not direct. Quentin's need to be a complete film maker is his biggest weakness. It is my opinion that if he truly wants to be involved in a film masterpiece he needs to focus on one thing (writing Or directing), and be humble in his role. Tarantino is not humble, and perhaps the freedom he has gained to make his own movies as dictator is admirable, but it doesn't make him a master. His insistence to insert himself into his films is always a mistake, and generally his presence as actor is the worst part of his films. He is not, never was, and never will be Sergio Leone, the film maker he so often tries to emulate.Enter the Hateful Eight - Visual media that could only be good if it was a 50 minute cartoon, and even then the cast of unlikable characters could doom the viewer to a short hour that they could never get back.I've always suspected that Tarantino has used his success to freely unload his racist, misogynistic views on a willing audience who accepts his work as art. The Hateful Eight has not changed this belief. This being said, at times people can do the right thing for the wrong reasons, which gets me to the one of the few redeeming quality of this film: this movie displays a host of iconic villains who live by the gun. The Hateful Eight can be seen to explore the mind set of simpletons who rely on violence as a livelihood and weapons as problem solvers. No matter where one stands on guns, this movie asks some interesting questions in this one regard.But who cares? Not only are all the characters here unredeeming, they are not compelling, interesting, fun, or worth spending any time around. And we spend A Lot of time with them. A Lot of time. Too Much Time. Way Too Much Time. The amount of time spent with these characters exceeds that which would be useful. How much time would be useful to spend with unlikable, uninteresting, unredeeming, violent imbeciles? I'll tell you tomorrow.The Hateful Eight gets off to an interesting, dynamic beginning where the characters are literally in motion. The location is fun, classic, and helps introduce widely divergent characters into a cramped space where no one can get away from one another. Unfortunately, openings end, and the location of the final 3/4 of this movie symbolizes the stagnant, boring characteristic taken by the vast majority of this film. I'm not ripping this movie because I don't like dialog driven films. Great, witty dialog can make a single location film an incredible experience. That is not what happens here.Tarantino can't help but insert himself into the film... again, and his presence comes off as flat and uninteresting sequences that would have better been edited out. I'll tell you a solution to getting rid of Tarantino's presence I also don't recommend... more time spent with these characters!If you want to watch a three hour live action cartoon (that feels like 5) about gun toting morons who can't die quickly enough, The Hateful Eight might be right up your ally. Why did I watch this movie? Because of the makers social relevance, and my occasional enjoyment of his films.Bad movie: 4 out of 10",4,28,57,5 January 2016
Black Mass," drudgery
","If you like slow, plodding movies full of unlikeable characters, by all means gear up for this sleep inducing film. Goodfellas is an action movie compared to Black Mass.There are a few good qualities here: top shelf production, excellent acting, a clear, concise story of characters making poor choices - leading to predictable consequences.But who cares? There's no entertainment here! None of these characters are worth giving a damn about, and the few sporadic scenes that offer any true value sit like islands on a still horizonless sea.But I learned something... Really? This might be the number one reason to sit through this boring expanse, and the info is not worth it. The scumbags are scumbags, the protagonist is a weak, shallow excuse for a law enforcer, and the other surrounding characters are bland at best (including Benedict, who for all his talent, brings nothing of note to an already white bread affair). Speaking of white bread - No culture what-so-ever, and often these fat, out of shape gangsters look absurd in their early 80's sunglasses and attire. There will be no awards given for costuming or make-up here. True Depp is transformed with prosthetics, but as a friend and I joked - his character is far exceeded by the likes of Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.If you've seen the trailer, you've been robbed of one of the films three or four memorable moments. Interestingly, all of these good scenes are just spice to the meat of the film. This is not a good thing! When the main arc is dull, the violence (while realistic) lacks stylistic punctuation, and the constant voice overs are delivered with apathy... one wonders what the hell the director was thinking!Waste of time, even for fans of actors involved.my score? a disappointingly average 5 out of 10.",5,139,245,20 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," no soul
","Every movie fanatic should see this movie... to get a clear look into how average dialog, below average directing, and poor story progression can not be disguised by technical excellence.Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker feels like a project that wants to do everything: do right by every character, fix what people didn't like about the first two films, complete the story, and be fun, grand, spiritual and great entertainment at the same time. But in this quest - the film becomes a chase after one McGuffin after another, with zero foreshadowing, and what feels like very loose plot structure trying to tie everything together. A lot of the content feels unloaded, instead of woven into the story structure. New characters are introduced, but none are well developed within the film, and few even change very much. I was never engaged in the story, nor interested in the characters, and felt almost no SW magic. The Rise of Skywalker is, to my eye, less than the sum of its parts.There are some nuanced moments that hit a particular chord: emotional, subtle detail, character revelations - but these moments hit like temporary nostalgia and are not sustained.The villain is not interesting, which is an absolute crime by SW standards. There are no anti heroes or morally textured characters. There are good guys and there are targets, and the consequences of violence carry little weight - which might be ok if The Rise of Skywalker had a lighter, more entertainment based tone, but it doesn't - it is a very serious film, but one that does not build to meaningful emotional payoffs. Perhaps fitting that one of the more consistent characters in this trilogy is hidden behind a mask for most of the film, squandering his presence, and depending upon voice acting for impact. Yea, this worked with Vader wonderfully in the original trilogy... but that is how that character was entirely designed from the beginning! It is one of many poorly conceived elements placed into this film with good intentions, but with no finesse or artistic skill.The serious tone is visually supported by a lot of grey tones and darkly lit scenes - but visually, I really feel The Rise of Skywalker is at its best with bright colors, and crisp detail - which is there at (fleeting) times. But mostly? It is like a lot of the effects were intentionally blurred and greyed out to create a gritty realistic look. I didn't really like this aesthetic choice, that is consistent throughout the film.SW is known for its saber duals and space combat - and it astonishes me how much more effective a movie like Return of the Jedi is than The Rise of Skywalker. True, the lightsaber effects, lighting, and sound have improved, but there just is no emotional weight to the saber fights. The mix of music, effects, setting and performance just never add up - and the same can be said of the space combat. Nothing is ever clear. Sure the viewer knows about mission objective in a generic way, but one never feels a part of the combat, or engaged in any meaningful strategy. Again, the cockpit lighting in the Hoth combat scenes in Empire Strikes Back are far superior to what is on display in this 2019 film. I never felt like I was in the cockpit of a spacecraft in the midst of a big battle - the presentation of these scenes is often more just documenting the event than any attempt to make the viewer part of the experience, and the attempt to make things more epic? Just add more! More ships! More targets! More friendlies! But how about a little immersion please! That is just bad directing, or a poor vision going in, but that would also be the directors fault. If I give the film an overall C+, I'd have to give JJ a D - which is tragic. The Rise of Skywalker depends upon its technical merit to prop up the entire experience, which I recognize, but hard work doesn't make a good movie - it takes vision, leadership and (hands off) producers who trust the artistic vision of writers and directors. I bet this film was not a fun one to make, in any phase of production - it just kinda feels that way coming through the screen.To this point, the only Disney renditions of SW with any merit would be Rogue One and the Mandalorian - and in my opinion, these projects are the bare minimum of what a fan should expect delivered. With the writing and directing talent out there, and the continued fanaticism of SW, the failure of this film to be little more than average? pretty disappointing!",6,4,9,22 December 2019
Baby Driver," got a recommendation for this...
","So I was completely surprised by the main character who's about as interesting as a wet rag or a 2x4. Baby (the name of the main character) happens to be amazing at driving cars - for no explained reason. He also loves music, which is the best part of this movie. In fact - I would argue the slick presentation and music is what sold many audience members. Producers put a ton of talent behind and around the camera. What do we have here? Another big budget film with directionless writing and shallow characters who follow obvious motivations. Well, obvious until the end of the movie - that just gets erratically stupid.Casting isn't bad nor is the dialog (neither is great), but this film falls flat on its face about 45 minutes in, when the audience is supposed to become interested in Baby's every day life. It is a tough sell - he's not interesting. One could call Baby Driver cliché, which it is: boy, girl, bad people and leverage against the hero - But the jobs (a huge part of the movie) have this nebulous, crime for the sake of crime pointlessness. Large chunks of this movie have zero reason or character motivations to occur - it's like everyone in this movie does stuff only because the script writers said so... that isn't a good thing! and makes this film feel truly artificial - when I'm guessing that was not the intention.Ultimately though - it's the characters that sink this film. They are boring and undeveloped. This leaves no one to root for. Maybe just follow the action?Sadly, Baby Driver isn't purely kinetic/action oriented enough to succeed on this merit alone (like a John Wick). In this case an uber stylized film fails for lack of commitment to a clear vision. Or... Baby Driver lacks successful execution of a music/action/crime/coming of age/love story/car driver movie.If you want a way better movie along these lines watch Drive (2011). If you want a fully fleshed out, mentally flawed hero watch The Accountant. If you want a pure action movie involving fighting, gunplay and driving watch The Raid II ;). Funny though, both the Raid movies do a better job with their characters, story and action - just not the music or slick Hollywood presentation.OK action movie that suffers from another average (at best) script 6/10",Null,3,7,21 September 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Captain A Bad Writing Movie
","CA:CW is one well produced piece of trash, a tuxedo on a turd. The core of this film is so completely void of substance, this film actually implodes in a series of poorly conceived scenes.Seriously? Was this move written by someone with English as their second language? Civil War is a clinic on bad writing: Dialog? flat and uninspired. Pacing? completely inconsistent and dictated by action scenes. Characters? superficial in ways that made likable characters in previous movies pale shadows of their former selves - i.e. this movie adds Nothing to these characters. Story??? a complete jumble of mismatched ideas, threads, and twists that ultimately results in a preposterous/(literally)unbelievable conclusion.Which brings me to my ultimate rant on a subsection of popular film that I have despised from the beginning: Comic Book Movies. I love comic books - and everything is already in place for great movie making. I mean FOR GODS SAKE comics not only give you the story arc & characters - comic books do the STORYBOARD FOR YOU!!! Comic books give all the content for great movies on a platter, so what do Hollywood producers do? Re-write! Re-imagine! Draw shadows of ideas from brilliant source material? It's pathetic, and insulting that this source has been mutilated, exploited, and perverted into what are generally nothing better than 2 hour TV episodes! Complete with *incomplete* story arcs where film makers have apparently forgotten what a movie IS!OK, this movie is for the most part pretty, and the action is often stunning - both in how it was conceived and executed. But even the quality of action drops off as the movie unfolds - the one thing this movie has to do well, it can't maintain.These reviews... its breaks my mind. What are people watching? What are they looking at? There isn't even a mirage of greatness here! The Spiderman character (for example) is an astonishing example of pointless exposition, throw away characters (complete with idiot, pull string dialog), and a troubling too common 'insert character' technique... that again, is actually a characteristic of bad film making! --and happens multiple times in this one movie!slick veneer and excellent action can't hide all the things this movie does wrong - the best 2/10 movie you will ever see",2,9,19,30 September 2016
Avengers: Endgame," One of the Worst 8.5+ Reviewed movies on IMDB
","First of all - this movie had to be brilliant to back up all the hype and legacy from earlier films. So is it brilliant? No, it's not even close.Second of all - Endgame just isn't a very good movie in any noteworthy sense, outside of effects and really good action scenes. And this brings me back to my first point. Perhaps this formula would work during the rise of comic films, but I can't see this film as anything but a huge disappointment.After a brutally emotional opening scene, that I have to admit - is really good, Endgame then proceeds to jump from scene to scene with inconsistent tone, pace, and development. A serious movie can have great humor, but the way Endgame uses slapstick humor, and non-serious characters is, well - silly. Is this a serious movie or not? Many of the films rules or conventions are openly broken to serve secondary storylines, and much of the 'science' is just plain dumb. I can suspend disbelief and get into stylized movies, but so much of this movie just comes off shallow and not really well thought out.This includes the story arc that to me has little natural flow. Many comic movies today seem to come off more as bad, incomplete TV episodes that rely on being part of a series for relevance. Movies should never be like that, and Endgame felt to me like three TV episodes jammed together, with three to five tac-on false endings.While I really liked many of the action scenes, which are clearly well conceived and beautiful to watch - at this point action scenes should be a given, and the story should have the same excellence. I don't feel like I'm being to picky when great movies in the Marvel universe exist (Dr. Strange for instance). I don't consider Infinity War one of them, but it's a heck of a lot better than Endgame.To me, outside of the opening scene, all the emotional moments fall absolutely flat. Considering the conclusion of Infinity War - there is a blatantly obvious sequence that should exude the epitome of joy. This part of the movie is hard to explain without giving spoilers, but in my opinion - this sequence is the writers biggest failure of the movie. The reunions are not well executed.Objectively, this movie probably deserves a 6 for production values, great action, and resolving the Infinity War outcome. But subjectively? I really thought this movie kinda sucked.",4,15,22,30 August 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I stand corrected
","Having an ax to grind against Quentin Tarantino for various reasons, I never thought he'd make a movie this good. Once Upon A Time in Hollywood seems less loved by his core fans, which really surprises me! I'm not a fan, and consider this not only his best film, but also an instant classic, go figure.Does any more really needs to be said about this film at IMDB? Very little likely, with over 4500 reviews. I'd also guess that 90% of the eyes that hit this review have already seen the movie. However, if you are in the minority, and wonder if you should watch this film? Yes!!! Absolutely.You will not see a better produced film in the modern era, perhaps outside of some Christopher Nolan films. The production quality is magnificent and fully earned the Academy Award. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is also a very clever film. All the content wraps around itself in ways that is very fun to think about after watching the movie. It's the first Tarantino film where I thought the violence was completely, thematically justified. It's also the first Tarantino film he didn't mare by casting himself in a major role and scene (thank you). Technically Tarantino also wasn't in True Romance, but this is a film he wrote, but did not direct.To a cynic, this movie is would be the better part of 2 hours of exposition, then about 40 good minutes of Tarantino to finish it off. I hate that interpretation. Most of the gold in this film is early on. There is no exposition. The ending is an amazing payoff to how the movie opens and evolves - exactly how it should be in top tier film making. Honestly - how many times have you seen a movie with an amazing first act, average second, and shit third? It happens all the time! For a movie to start this good, then end better? It's just great film making, and perhaps something I never really appreciated about Tarantino films. They are complete, and his third acts are often the strongest of the three.Not to mention the likable nature of the two main characters, which is absolutely new to me in a Tarantino film. Textured characters? sure. Interesting characters? you betcha! But Likable characters? No way - Tarantino films are generally so packed with unlikable characters, It's a wonder I get through them at all! This is often a deal breaker for me regarding film, tv, books, short stories. I have to root for someone. I have to want to see their story unfold. This has Nothing to do with characters ethics or worldview, simply, are they likeable?In this case yes! They are fun, interesting, dangerous and full of great dialog. And about that dialog. By Tarantino standards it is very spare. The grandstanding and diatribes are where they should be, and everywhere else the dialog moves wonderfully with the pace of the film. Other Tarantino films, Inglorious Bastards comes to mind, have scenes so bloated with dialog, the viewer can actually forget the context of the scene! The who, what, when, where, why. That isn't a good thing! To me, it was the biggest barrier between Tarantino making a classic film like many of Sergio Leone's films. Sergio understood silences and spare use of dialog, and I always felt Tarantino wanted to be Sergio, but also wanted to flaunt his greatest talent, writing. I think Tarantino found the correct balance in this film, and at this stage of his career, to make this huge change in approach is admirable.I consider it a great film, and my favorite moments have to be the cut-away scenes and moments were we see the main character in TV shows and Movies. The violence in these scenes is truly hilarious, and builds into a greater part of the movies theme. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood basically asks questions about media violence, and so completely smashes any culpability/responsibility (though content) - it basically visually slaps around anyone who thinks media violence is responsible for anything in reality. And I Love It. But I'm digging deep here, intentionally, to attempt to get at some of the magic of this movie. There's a Lot going on here to be analyzed, thought about, enjoyed. Just like Brad Pitt's character who's stuntman presence is implied in the movies and TV shows, there is a lot of invisible content throughout this movie.Including acting - And I think this might be Dicaprio's best movie. And I am a huge fan of his ever since Blood Diamond. Pitt is perfect in his role, but really? That role didn't require a ton of dynamic range. However, it shouldn't be devalued to be perfectly cast, and deliver a perfect performance. The point I really wanted to make about the acting is how complex it gets at times. More than once Dicaprio is acting in a scene about acting (generically speaking), while going through the mannerisms of an actor... all while in character. From both a direction, and acting perspective, you have to understand these moments so clearly yourself, but then also have to be on the same page as all the other creative performers on set for this to work. It's quite the dance, and watching these meta scenes is pure magic.There's an old film making technique where you cast an average actor into a bit role opposite the lead, in order to make the lead actor's performance look better, and stand out. You see it a lot in 40's and 50's movies. You'll also see it in this film. I'm actually a big fan of the TV actor who played this small role, and it was nice to see him in this movie.I've stressed a lot of the details, while leaving out the general nature of the movie - and perhaps that makes for an uncertain review. But don't get me wrong. Entertainment is in my opinion the first priority of film. Without which, any extra sauce might as well just be mayonnaise. And Once Upon a Time in Hollywood delivers fabulous entertainment. But it isn't (simply) a single viewing experience. It is a movie that holds up to multiple viewings, and (I would guess) will age very, very well... not unlike it's two leads.9/10 but I'm not sure why I'm not giving it a 10/10 - if I figure that out, perhaps I'll revisit this review.",9,3,5,19 March 2020
2012," entertainment above all else
","2012 is a AAA Blockbuster, a popcorn eating summer film, a movie one watches for a single reason: Entertainment. 2012 immediately establishes a visual style that can transition from ordinary scenes to special effects sequences nearly flawlessly. Pace is very well managed, and all the scenes follow a logical tempo - depending upon the nature of the given content. In other words this film is well produce and well directed.2012 is a highly kinetic, outlandish natural disaster movie - that easily could be considered the best of this particular genre. The absurd, over the top nature of the special effects sequences has to be seen to be believed, and even more recent films like San Andreas are 2nd class compared to the audio visual display in this film.Casting and performances are way better than one would expect in this type of movie - for all the action and spectacle? The characters carry this film from scene to scene, with no weak links. There are some stand out performances by Woody Harrelson (short but sweet) and Tom McCarthy (who's strait guy act in insane situations is so convincing, it's easy to overlook his excellent performance throughout the film).While I'd consider this a movie the whole family can watch, there is an element of darkness in the content. While this movie isn't violent, implied violence occurs as a result of the disaster, regularly. Even the main characters face consequences, which is necessary to maintain the films tension.I'm a huge fan of the overall morality of this film. It overtly maintains an optimistic attitude, while tragedy occurs in every major scene. Perhaps this is because this isn't a serious film, but it is an interesting dynamic regardless. The film clearly takes sides in any science vs religion debate - taking the side of science, which is perhaps ironic? Because many very basic scientific principles are regularly broken in order for this film to work stylistically. Not to mention the title of this film presents mystical prophecy. Regardless, I appreciate how this film presents this argument through storytelling, right from the opening scene.I would say this movie gets off to a fantastic start, starting the tension off with big ideas. The first act is by far the best part of the movie. It's punctuated by (imo) one of the greatest special effect sequences ever created for the big screen. It relies heavily on computer graphic effects, and I think many viewers simply can not suspend enough disbelief to fully enjoy this scene, but if you can? Strap in! and enjoy the ride!There is another noteworthy action scene that lives up to the first, but other that that - the effects come when needed to show the spread of destruction and chaos. This would be my one major critique of the film. The best scenes are in the first couple acts, then the final act is more about individuals being brave in much smaller scale scenes. While this allows more focus on all the main characters, I'd rather have the mother of all spectacle scenes to end the film, actually trumping the scenes earlier in the film.But that may be a bit of a harsh critique, when really? This movie doesn't make any huge mistakes. The story is complete, characters are developed, and spectacular large scale scenes unfold in (somewhat) of a believable manner.One more comment on the special effects. In all of the large scale scenes, the way water, chunks of earth and buildings crash against each other? It looks... realistic! I mean, if a 5000 ton chunk of a mountain was thrown a mile in the air and landed 100 meters away you in reality? It would probably look and sound something like the special effects in this film! While this movie relies heavily on computer graphics, all of the CG has an actual depth, and the consistency of the lighting in the CG that is combined with live action shots? All I can say is the visual style of this film is quite the achievement.2012 was made for 200 million (quite a bargain, really) and made 150 million in the US and 550+ million overseas. So in a way 2012 is one of the movies that can be blamed for insipid AAA films that, attempting to gain the largest world audience, end up being an unwatchable mess to seasoned fans of films. But I would argue that movies like this and the original Charlies Angels had such great overseas success not because of universal appeal, but because they are examples of quality AAA films that emphasize entertainment above all other qualities. Great filmmaking still needs to occur! Emphasizing entertainment may cut some corners with logic and force an audience to suspend disbelief... but you can't make trash films like the Transformer sequels and then just expect they will succeed! And this is why I really appreciate 2012, and feel it holds up to multiple viewings. Regardless of its ridiculousness - 2012 contains a ton of quality film making.Entertainment! 8/10",8,3,5,10 February 2019
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Actually a 10 out of 10 - 1080p review
","Anyone who has worked in film knows every project is engineered. A film is built by combining visuals, effects, and various forms of audio. When everything comes together, the audience is simply absorbed in the experience. Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind is such a film, where the final product is far greater than the sum of individual parts. There are many science fiction films that deal with apocalypse, or disaster. Hayao Miyazaki travels 1000 years past the earth's last stand in order to tell this tale of heroism. The setting is a ruined, scorched earth - toxic, but with small patches of habitable land. Inside the toxic land a mutant fungi and insect jungle thrives, where we are introduced to the main character, and the strange wonders of this future world. Even after a millennium of war almost exterminated humanity, conflict still rules the day. Nausicaä is not without harsh moments, but even at its most difficult or strange moments - beauty persists. The audio fits - dialog, ambient, music. The atmosphere of this film lives and breathes.I've always loved creepy crawly things. I sought them out as a kid, and still am fascinated by the abundance of available media showing earths range of insects and arachnids. Any wonder I love this movie? Sure I also like arachnophobia, slither, and critters - but don't confuse any of these movies to NVotW.I feel Nausicaä Valley of the Wind is one of the most wonderful, symbolic films ever made. It displays Miyazaki's unique brilliance; as a world builder and detail oriented film engineer. This is my personal favorite Miyazaki film, and though I'm a huge fan I don't think any of his other movies are in the same league. Certainly his newer movies are more polished, complex, and beautiful. But Nausicaä the character shines with the greatest qualities - heroic, able, brilliant and selfless. Combine this character, a wildly creative setting, add an epic story = 10/10 viewed 1080p version that really showed the detail of this '84 animation. dated, but just so good!",10,3,4,24 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," IMDB SW fans... are you kidding me?
","Bottom line SW:TLJ is the best Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi - and it isn't even close. The writing/directing is light years ahead of the last 5 SW films - probably closest to being on par with the quality of Return of the Jedi, just without the ewoks.This is space opera/science fantasy at its finest - at least in the medium of film.So why my (?) title? Because it appears the majority of reviews coming in on IMDB, opening night, are opinion generated discharges of hate. It's baffling. It's like people went in with some expectation, and when this wasn't a ESB the reboot? They stopped watching.I can never prove to anyone the quality of this film. I can just tell you what I saw. Two dimensional characters from The Force Awakens suddenly have depth, humanity and.... real dialog! At its worst TLJ can be a little heavy handed with direct/obvious lines, but often this is very intentional and a lot of humor is derived from these moments. The visuals are absolute top shelf and somehow functional effects at the same time. The effects are used strictly for story telling purposes. This movie is actually pretty spare, with every moment mattering - this hasn't happened in a SW film since ESB!Fanaticism should never inhibit someone from appreciating fine film making.In time this review will be absolutely buried and forgotten, and hopefully so will most of these initial low reviews. Time will treat this film very kindly.SW fan who is also a big fan of this movie: 9 out of 10",9,2,13,15 December 2017
Sicario," outstanding
","Sicario is tense, well made, and makes great use of the talented Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro. Gritty realism combined with a series of escalating situations - Sicario blends environment seamlessly with characters and content. Strictly as an invention of the writer and director, this movie shines as well made piece of visual fiction, but there is so much more to stop and think about after the film is done. This film flirts with an often over used term: masterpiece.At it's heart this film is a mystery, and Emily's character is our gateway into the gray area of the drug war, its combatants, and a vicious circle of violence.Casting: brilliant. Each character is believable, tangible, real.Directing: superb. This guy is on a roll, he knows the material, and did a stellar job of translating the writing into visual fiction.Location: a rare treat to witness such seamless integration of the environment into the content of a film. Disquieting use of camera and sound punctuates growing intensity, and clever use of light and dark guides the eye with visual symbolism.Realism, I think, can at times be more difficult to analyze and critique, especially if the viewer is hypnotized by what they see and completely buy into the story. This movie makes presenting the abstraction that is film look so very easy.With such generalizations, who will like this movie? Fans of the cast, people who like watching military ops, and media junkies who like a good mystery. Sicario is violent, harsh, and does not pander to what people want to see - it is an unrelenting journey into a world of predators and their victims, as well as a exhibition of class film making.nearing perfection: 9 out of 10",9,1,4,14 October 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the what?
","The most astonishing thing about this movie to me is how fast I forgot the entire experience.I kinda remember that cool opening scene with Groot - but after that? Guardians of the Galaxy 2 moves from one action scene to the next with a bunch of random banter about an extended family... which is completely contradicted in the final 15 minutes.I also remember a bunch of absurd happenings during the action scenes. Improbable results, luck, weird environments that do not follow any known physics and characters screaming at one another over the ambient sound.To paraphrase someones wisdom - the script wasn't the result of time, hard work, skill and craftsmanship. Things happen on the screen because the screen writers say so. This is what many superhero films have become: glorified CG cartoons that feel like really long TV episodes.Ironic too - in an age of great TV writing, many blockbuster movies have been reduced to mass world wide appeal instead of any unique writer/director vision.I really didn't like this movie 3/10",3,163,315,8 July 2017
Arrival," A High Ceiling
","As a fan of science fiction, there are occasional movies I absolutely must see in the theater. I would include Arrival on this list, and really had high anticipation for this viewing.Arrival does not disappoint those looking for quality film making, and a story well told. But I left not being amazed by a science fiction movie, but seeing another fine example of Denis Villeneuve's film making. He has a unique skill of handling the specific details of one or two characters, while placing them in a chaotic/dangerous environment. Prisoners, Incendes, Enemy, Sicario - You really get to know the main characters in his films though their stress and hardship - that are a function of the environment, and story being told.Once again Villeneuve nails a consistent visual look, that somehow works from exteriors, interiors, close, long, and even shots with special effects. I'm sure like Nolan, his films have color schemes and strict design to maintain visual consistency. I didn't feel like the environment was a character like in Sicario, but Arrival is beautiful none the less - especially in the atmospheric vistas which include the alien craft.The visuals and unique content are matched by a jarring, yet somehow completely fitting and even beautiful(?) music score. Might be one of the best parts of this movie and it is clear Jóhann Jóhannsson and Villeneuve have a solid working relationship.I read a ton of science fiction, and rarely do movies even come close to the concepts and ideas presented by the best authors of this genre. Arrival comes close. Like Nolan's Interstellar, Arrival presents challenging ideas through clever editing, sound design, and visual presentation. But there is nothing like Interstellar's tesseract sequence. Everything is done with traditional film techniques. Yes there are special effects for obvious elements regarding the aliens and their craft, but the vast majority of deep ideas are not attached to visual effects. Not only that, but not all the answers are spoon fed - the viewer has to bring a bit of intelligence to the experience for understanding. This is comprehensive too. What does the title mean? Why are certain camera shots repeated? What exactly is happening with the main character?These questions are answered over the films two hours.Critiques. Recreating TV news broadcasts must be difficult in film, because rarely is it done well. The background sets never look quite right, the actors don't behave like news anchors and when they use real people to play themselves? Almost the worst stylistic choice, because it always feels contrived. Arrival uses a lot of created media footage to help set the world stage of an international event. It's acceptable in terms of presentation, and works - but its not great. Speaking more generally, this lack of polish could also be the result of this film being a bit rushed. I noticed the same thing with directors Blomkamp's films. District 9 is stunning, but each successive film he has made seems less complete and polished due to scheduling and less of the ability to make each film a labor of love. Hopefully this won't become a trend with Villeneuve's films.Worth mentioning: This movie is not Interstellar. Arrival doesn't have the mega budget, or explosive entertainment. The Arrival has a slow pace, heartfelt emotion regarding difficult parts of the human condition, and a complex conclusion that requires some thinking. A group of people walked out of the showing I wend to... five minutes before the film ended, and really I can't blame them. If they were looking for pure entertainment, action or a hyped science fiction film? Probably not the movie they were hoping to see.But me? I'm a huge fan of this director and I fully enjoyed this movies theater experience. It pleases me to see him working in this genre, and I'm excited for his future work.Expectations met 8-10",8,2,8,11 November 2016
Straight Outta Compton," About the music...
","and this will decide whether you like the movie or not. Note: like - not love or hate. This movie is neither as good as the hype, nor as bad as the blow hards. Its rests somewhere in-between.I was very surprised by the time-line. In '89 I was listening to this music - a lot. Anyone young and into rap music at the time had this in their play list with 2 Live Crew, Public Enemy, Sir Mix A Lot, Stesasonic, 3rd Bass amongst others. But you have to understand I was also listening to De La Soul, Faith No More, and the Beastie Boys. I'd like to think now, looking back, I have a bit of perspective at NWA's relevance at that time. If we were left believing this movie - NWA had no peers, and no matter what people think, they did. Back to the point, it is astonishing how fast NWA made their bones, got distribution, and made it to every corner of the US of A. I should know, I was in a backwater corner - might as well of been living in a tree house by comparison to the urban vistas of this film.What's good? The music is good. Dialog, and performances often have snap, humor, and a legit feel. There is some good acting, and you can tell a lot of work went into these performances. SouttaC is well produced - it has all the trappings: sound, shots, lighting, glitz, glamor - absurd % of hot chicks with flesh flying high in many an over the top scene. This shouldn't be overlooked, or under appreciated. People completely out of the NWA loop will also learn a thing or two about the members and events. But this movie is not made for educational purposes, and a lot of the material is not presented in a way that improves the film.This movie has omissions - smoking, and smoking and, smoking and drinking. Yea, it is implied - but the reality of this behavior is flat not the film. There are also way too many throw away lines that are supposed to indicate other huge absences: like Cube's film career.Who edited this? Was the director by the editors side? Maybe that was the problem - this movie has more chop than a fickle lake shore. Many (all?) of the heavy dramatic scenes fall flat, because suddenly everyone is crying, angry, yelling, fighting, bouncing - with no set up! How the hell is a viewer supposed to buy into these lives, when the films tempo and presentation of material is all over the place? Good guys, bad guys, grey guys - whatever! As in all movies, it comes down to the script. Very unlikely that the script was written how this film is edited, which leads me to believe this movie was attempted to be saved in post instead of extensive preproduction. It felt as though preproduction focused on character building, not character development, and integrating them into a cohesive work of art. Predictably, the last 20 minutes of the film is painful to watch, in large part due to the strict chronological unfolding of events. Many viewers will give this a pass due to content - I won't; it is bad film making.Perhaps most disappointing is the formulaic approach: From out of nowhere, rise to fame, we are a brotherhood, money causes issues, band members fall out, everything goes wrong for the bad guys, but the good guys come out on top. What is this? A well produced episode of inside the music, or history of rock and roll? Reduced to it's essence, this is a pretty damn bland film - that never chooses exactly what it wants to be.Love NWA? - you gonna like this movie. Hate NWA, rap culture? Then F off! Crazy how people go Way out of their way to hate and attempt to $#|+ on things they have opinions about. My attempt? Objective analysis. Did I mention the editing in this movie is terrible?My rating - 6.5/10, rounded down",6,17,55,17 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Reboot
","Star Wars: TFA updates the franchise with beautiful 3D, excellent casting, familiarity, and more than a little nostalgia. By and large it is a solid, entertaining movie that will please all but the most jaded of fans. For better or worse, this iteration asks to be judged on the qualities of earlier films due to the return of characters, visuals, ideas, music, and themes.Breathtaking visuals! This movie absolutely glows, and everyone involved with the look, style, special effects, and presentation should be proud of their achievement. The Force Awakens delivers some of the best use of visual 3D ever to hit the big screen. Incredible depth, memorable vistas, amazing sense of scale, and a wide variation of organic vs artificial environments are gifted to those lucky enough to see this film on the best screens cinema can offer.The famous Star Wars sound effects are intertwined with a commendable music score - it is nice to experience bold music that doesn't demand attention, yet is fully present in the total experience. The score is not on the level of the original trilogy, perhaps due to the lack of complete originality.The casting is borderline brilliant. One of the best traditions SW has maintained is casting relative unknowns into major roles. I feel this takes bravery and skill in casting and directing. It is easy to envy and fall in love with the main characters, and like those involved in post production - these young actors should hold their heads high, and accept the well earned praise.Writing and Story - Eh... this is where I have to unfortunately hold my own fanaticism accountable. Very average. Especially the writing. There are moments of real humor, timing, and sequences one can get lost in, but there is no wit. Many of the places where intelligent dialog should have occurred come off as silly, generic, even idiotic. I'm not a stickler for the lack of science in SW - light speed travel around the galaxy, noise in space, and bad motivators are not my problem. But cliché dialog during the build up to a war, and adults speaking like children is disappointing. Reader, please refresh your memory with classic dialog from the original trilogy: 'Thank the maker, this oil bath is going to feel so good...', 'Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side kid.', 'The circle is now complete. When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.' - There isn't one line in TFA that stands along side the many timeless lines from A New Hope, the movie The Force Awakens tries so hard to emulate. For those who have so quickly forgotten the lyrical wizardry of the original trilogy, 'I find your lack of faith disturbing.'Originality? This is a reboot by the numbers. Elements chopped and remixed like bad stir fry do not taste good, and insult the palate of the seasoned Star Wars fan. We have all seen the original trilogy too many times. Because it is brilliant! Because of the originality! Because it does something wonderful to the mind and senses. The arc of The Force Awakens comes off like a blast of MSG, but instead of fooling the senses, the obviousness of the ripoff lacks perhaps the most important ingredient in the SW formula: a soul.Yes, this movie is orders of magnitude better than episode I, II & III. Yes, it is a fun movie full of wonderful qualities, and well worth the price of admission. But no, this is not truly great film making and not the work of a master. I'm glad that JJ did his homework this time, and didn't tarnish an entire franchise with sloppy research and entertainment at all cost production. He succeeded in this project, but the sights were set too low.This generation's kids deserve better - they deserve a fresh IP, new characters, and a new story - not a mix of old and new in a fashionable attempt to appease generational fans. In my heart of hearts, I really wanted to believe that SW:TFA could be completely fresh, new, intelligent And still Star Wars - but not from this film maker, not with this story, not with this writing.While it may seem as though this old fan did not like this movie, actually I did. It was just so beautiful, and fun to experience with a large audience. I hope many people share my experience - but I also hope many more crave fresh ideas like me, and will support the next great film maker, with truly new and exciting science fiction ideas.an optimistic and fanatical - 7 out of 10",7,0,6,19 December 2015
Annihilation," Science Fantasy Blender
","I would never say this is a bad movie. There is a ton of merit including solid production, good acting... interesting? Sure.I haven't read the book, so I can't speak to the interpretation of the film makers - however, one aspect of this film really is a red flag. The monster. This is Gene Wolfe's Alzabo from his seminal 'Book of the New Sun'. Not just what the monster is, but also how it behaves, and the dialog about it's behavior. It's a strait up lift. Except Gene Wolfe's monster, scenario and outcome is better in every single way. The monster does provide one of the best scenes in the movie - a very graphic attack upon the main characters.If one has read the Light trilogy by M John Harrison? There's the shimmer - except more defined, interesting and entertaining.Blindsight by Peter Watts? This book is 2/3's a discussion on trying to investigate and understand something truly alien, either an entity, their realm and how this is interpreted by our limited minds and senses. A lot of the ideas in Blindsight are also in Stanislaw Lem's Solaris & knowing Gene Wolfe through his work and research? He likely visualized his alzabo monster beginning with some mythological beast from classic literature. What I'm saying is everyone draws content from somewhere, but as an artist? Gotta make it your own, take ownership and avoid an obvious theft of material.All three of these books are way more interesting and deep than this movie, which is common (almost to the point of being a rule). Not to mention the source material may well be completely different and better as well.To drop my cynicism, if this movie is genuinely enjoyed? I strongly recommend reading some of the above science fiction/science fantasy.But to get back to my film critique, the last kick to the groin would be the films 'Usual Suspect' ending that throws the entire movie into doubt. Clearly we, the viewers are supposed to believe the main character is in fact a duplicate, like her romantic interest - which could only be true if she lied during her debriefing. The movie is a visualization of her debriefing. So what really is the truth? I'm not a fan of this loose, foggy take on content.I believe there are some questions regarding how gender is handled in this film, but I'm not going down that rabbit hole... well maybe a little ways. The end of the film hints at the event making a change. Clearly the destination in the film, the lighthouse, is a womb metaphor, from which a new version of humanity, one man, one woman, emerge. I do wish the film would have gotten more into how peoples thoughts were altered by the alien environment, and the importance of conscious thought in resolving the situation. This content is implied at best - absent at worst.One could certainly argue that all the unanswered questions fit - that the event feeds into the mystery, feeds into the conclusion. I just think there is a better approach to convey these ideas. M John Harrison, Peter Watts might agree.well made (mysterious) movie with copy and paste ideas, 6/10",6,1,2,10 April 2018
