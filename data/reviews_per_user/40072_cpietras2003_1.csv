Mission: Impossible III," Wow what a bad movie
",I heard friends say the movie was bad and thought they were being to critical and when I saw it I agreed. It was one of those movies that wasn't well thought out. There were scenes that dragged out and could have been so much shorter and then there were the scenes that details were left out. IE Mr. Hunt gathering a virus as usual and none of hoe he got it and we the audience are just told that he does. I was so disappointed in this movie and to make it worse they didn't show any good previews before the show. WAIT FOR THE DVD!! Don't waste your money on going to see this movie. Phillip Seymour Hoffman gave a great performance in this movie,3,1,2,6 May 2006
