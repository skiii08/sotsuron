Requiem for a Dream," An unforgettable film
","One of my friends recommended this film to me in July.  I rented it and watched it with him and a friend from out-of-town.  After we watched it, we sat in my room in silence for at least an hour.  This film is the most dramatic, terrifying film I have ever seen in my life and I love this film. Since then, I've recommended it to many people and have only watched it again once.  I mean, this movie has a story that could possibly happen (a few things added in for drama though but I won't mention anything in particular).  It's amazing what kind of hell four individuals go through just to live their dreams, only to pay for them later on.  Everybody loses.The acting is amazing.  Ellen Burstyn stole the show, with her obsession with being on television.  I feel she terrible for her in the film, since I feel that she was the one who was hurt the most.  Jennifer Connelly did an awesome job, showing what people are willing to do to feed their addictions. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans did an excellent job as well, but not as good as the two leading female characters (in my opinion at least).The camera angles were awesome.  Some of the ones in this film I had never seen before, where the actor/actress was following the camera, while walking forward (kinda have to see it to get my point).  It helped pull me into the film, relating me to all the troubles the characters were going through.The music is probably better than the acting.  The tracks range from a soft orchestra to techno to creepy, loud, and sudden noise.  The music helps the viewer delve deeper into this dark universe.  The music flows well, going from soft music during tender/non-active moments to hightened, intense music during intense sceens (especially near the end of the film).  The soundtrack was so good I went out and bought it.Although I don't plan to use drugs, this film single-handedly shows why you shouldn't.  This story of addiction is not to be ignored.  I recommend this film to anyone and everyone.  Addict or not, watch this film!  It might not leave you silent for an hour, but it is a good, artistic film that demands watching.  I personally give this film a 10/10!",Null,2,4,26 April 2004
