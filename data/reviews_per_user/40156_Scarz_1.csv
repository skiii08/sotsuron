The Blair Witch Project," Not scary at all!
","I finally got to see the over rated, hevily hyped movie 'The Blair Witch Project.'  Project is the right word for it!  The ending was so extremly disappointing that it angered me.  I sat through the entire movie wating for a great scare to rock me out of my seat.  The fear kept building up and building up and at the end, BANG!  You get smacked with the credits, although I do like the style of how the movie was done... as for be realistic, I dont know were that came from?",1,0,2,1 August 1999
