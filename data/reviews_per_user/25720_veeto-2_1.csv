Sucker Punch," An absolute Modern Masterpiece
","Zach Snyder paints another masterpiece. Visually spectacular and poetic, Director extraordinary, Great Style and Set (the same of Avatar), Soundtrack Powerful, Good Cast (Emily Browing is very Good) and incredibly original plot. The first very long sequence is to be left open-mouthed, to the movies a lot and we were ready to see a movie, Casino and full of rhythm (wich still are) just started ... but all in silence, he has kidnapped, has just silenced. And who often goes to the movies know what it's like this. IMHO the only flaw is that the movie is a little too short, so i Hope in a Directo's Cut in Blu-Ray. If you liked 300 or watchmen this is an absolutely MUST SEE!",10,17,35,26 March 2011
