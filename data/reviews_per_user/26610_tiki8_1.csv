Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas has forgotten what we loved about the first movies...
","George Lucas seems to have forgotten that it was never the special effects in the first three movies that captured everyones' hearts...it was the characters and story.In The Phantom Menace, computer technology has finally caught up with his imagination and he is able to do all the special effects he's ever dreamed of, but at the crucial expense of character and story development.George, if you read this, go back and watch A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi again, and look at how you pulled us into your world with characters we could care about and get excited for.",7,0,1,20 May 1999
