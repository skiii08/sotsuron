Saturday Night Fever," Absolutely Exhilarating!
","Now this is a classic! It's funny ('Al Pachino!') sad, raw and affecting. Plus one of the best soundtracks in film history! Johnny T. gives one of his best performances ('sides Fiction) as Tony, a Brooklyn toughie who works at a paint shop, gets laid, hangs out his his low life friends and burns the dance floor every saturday night. THis film is about how he starts to hate his racist, hateful life in Brooklyn and wants to escape from his pals and his dysfunctional family to Manhattan. As i said before, this Movie is raw, the last scenes with Tony and his friends when he realizes that he hates his life is powerful stuff. The dance scenes are great too. Anyone who hasn't seen this important and classic Flick by now is officially considered a fink!Jesse Tucker",Null,2,2,30 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great movie this is, see it you do
","Sorry everybody, but here goes...this is my new favorite Star Wars movie. Better than 'Hope', Better than Empire (But just barley) and of course, better than 'Jedi' (Though not as good as Menace...kidding). Exellent Sci-Fi comes rarely in a blue moon, mostly it's just cold, weird (in a bad way) and kiddie. I hate the crap that that stupid Sci-Fi channel has done to tarnish the once good name of Shi-Fi. Strange new worlds, adventure and good old fashoned aliens are what great fu**in Science Fiction is for me. Horror and Comedy are still tops, but the strange world of Sci-Fi still floats my boat.Now, on to the Wars. As i said, Fi isn't really my genre, but i've always loved Star Wars. I don't need to praddle on about how great those old movies are, but i will. Engrossing story, great charactors, ahead of it's time SFX...and Vader was pimp. But when Lucas decided to pick up the regins and shoot the first three segments via blue screen. Now about that Episode one that everyone was in a tizzy about...it sucked, but i'm sure that in that theater, in the moment, after years and months and painful DAYS of waiting, in that packed theater surrounded with other estatic fans it seemed just great. Afterwords was the time for nipicking, and on video it's the worst gosh darn movie ever, i swear (but i can't on this site).Now Clones, this takes all the great elements of the Holy Trilogy that i was talking about and just makes boosts them ten times higher. The problem with Menace, 'sides the steriotypes and annoying little kids that you wanted to die (That Jake Lloyd COULDN'T have become Vader) you got the feeling that Lucas was afraid to go all the way, get totally engrossed in the story, feel and 'Star Wars' vibe. Doesn't make that same mistake again. The entire movie i was knew that this was TRUE Star Wars. I bought the love angle, ignoreing the complants against it because hey, it's not going to be Romeo and Juliet, give Lucas some friggen credit for at least having a love story this involved. Some scenes between Portman and Christianson were actually pretty erotic for a Star Wars flick. Also loved the 'Blade Runner' feel of the beggining (If i spell words wrong it's because i'm being kicked off). Add that on with great dialogue between Obi and Anakin, AMAZING CGI, John Williams re-using some classic scores from the original trilogy, 3PO and R2 being cool again for the first time in like, 16 years, Samuel Jackson strutting with a saber. And finally...YODA LIGHTSABER STYLE! DANCE YODA DANCE!!!!!!!!!!In other words...Great Sci-Fi.",Null,0,0,17 May 2002
Good Will Hunting," wow, who knew?
","So, here i am, watching this brilliant drama about one low class guy with a gift whose wants to ignore his chance for a truly better life. He's talking to his best friend, telling him that he's going to stay in the low life he's lived since he was a kid. But his friend looks him strait in the eye and tells him that he can't life like this anymore and he has a true chance in life. As i was getting misty eyed and sad at this amazing seen one thought popped into my head...THIS WAS WRITTEN BY BEN AFFLECK AND MAT DAMON!!!!!! How could these two actors, one a kinda famous actor who's only really good on a Kevin Smith movie set, and the other whose doesn't have any claim to fame at all write an amazing screenplay that's touching and funny and sad. The characters were great, the acting and directing was great and everything in this Movie gelled so well! Robin Williams gave the best performance of his career (aside from Rainbow Randolf of corse!) and Matt And Ben proved they are great actors under the direction of someone besides Kev Smith! Hell, even Casey Affleck is good!Jesse Tucker",Null,0,2,30 March 2002
When Harry Met Sally...," Cute...chick stuff, but cute
","This is probably the best 'Romantic chick flick Nora Ephron Movie'. Even though some parts were a big ripoff of Woody Allen's classic Annie Hall, i still enjoyed it plenty. Billy Crystal was funny (See this along side Throw Mama From THe Train and see how funny the man is) and Meg Ryan Was cute. Not Meathead's best (that honer would be a cross between Spinal Tap and Stand By Me) but fun to watch. Good script, Good actors, fun story. Good for a friday night.Jesse Tucker",Null,0,1,30 March 2002
