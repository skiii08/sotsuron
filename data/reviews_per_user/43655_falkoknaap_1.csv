Hereditary," One of the best horror movies i have seen in a long time
","I watched alot of horror movies. Alot of them are about scaring the hell out of you with jump scares and cheesy scares. This movie was more then that. It had a powerfull story line with awesome actors. It scrables with your brain about what is going on and who is right, untill the ending reveals it all. I recommend it highly, this is why it (unlike other horror movies) has a high rating for a horror movie.",10,1,4,15 September 2019
