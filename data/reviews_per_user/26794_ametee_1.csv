Deja Vu," foreordination and samsara
","I like the science and action movies very much such as 'deja vu'.Under this kind of movies,we can not only enjoy a stimulation of visual sense,but also take an intelligent interest and attract in science.I found that 'deja vu' bear a resemblance with a Chinese RPG game 'PAL'.They all relate to reversal of time and the hours.I think it's enigmatical,marvelous fantastic amazing!!!The differences in plot between the two is that in 'PAL' the leading actor didn't change the stuff and situation when he return to ten years ago,but the actor in 'deja vu' did.No matter what result maybe,we should get the enlightenment that LIFE,with all of its fragile wonders,should always be pulling us in.The arrangement of director is so pretty and ingenious that make me love the movie so deeply.By the way,the actor Denzel Washington's cracking good show give me expressions so much.I have seen his movie 'Fallen',is equal exciting to 'deja vu' in plot and performance.His smile...intriguing,riveting,and captivating...",9,1,2,28 July 2007
