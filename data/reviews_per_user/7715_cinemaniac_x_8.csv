Black Swan," A nightmarish masterpiece
","Black Swan is a visual masterpiece, a disturbing character study, and a gut-wrenching psychological horror piece. In one of the best films of the year, Darren Aronofsky directs with a bold artistic vision, documenting the rapid mental breakdown of the paranoid and perfectionist ballerina Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). In an Oscar-worthy performance, and certainly the performance of her career, Portman sheds her sweetheart attitude and travels to new depths of acting, at the same time that her character loses her innocence and descends into madness.In fact, Black Swan abounds with such artistic parallels. It is a film about ballet, and moreover it is a ballet; it features over-the-top theatricality and uses the nightmarish music of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, the ballet around which the film is centered.In Swan Lake, one dancer must portray both the innocent White Swan and her evil twin, the sensual Black Swan. The psychological duality of these roles parallels Nina's own duality, which she explores with devastating consequences. The doppelganger aspect of Swan Lake is also seen in the film, as Nina is haunted by her double, the free-spirited Lily (Mila Kunis), who becomes Nina's understudy and seems to embody her darker side.As Nina struggles with the dual nature of her ballet role, she must deal with other issues as well, ranging from her strained relationship with her repressive mother (Barbara Hershey) to unwanted attentions from the ballet company's director (Vincent Cassel). Also suffering from an eating disorder, obsession, and paranoia, Nina bends under the immense pressure and begins to see grisly hallucinations that take a toll on her mental health.But in a film with an unreliable protagonist, reality and hallucinations are often indistinguishable, and this is what makes the film fun. The viewer must judge whether Nina's perspective is accurate and whether certain events even happened. Thus Black Swan becomes a multilayered film with many possible interpretations.This complexity is further enhanced by Aronofsky's clever manipulation of mirrors; there is a mirror in almost every scene. Mirrors are often associated with deception, desire for perfection, and duality, ideas that are all explored in the film. Moreover, small details such as the color of Nina's clothing illustrate the duality at the center of her struggle. Her change in wardrobe color choice, from light to dark, parallels her mental collapse and her psychological transformation from the pure White Swan to the evil Black Swan.Symbolism and parallelism aside, Black Swan is an audacious declaration of Aronofsky's creativity. He constructs an unlikely blend of horror and ballet, mental illness and artistic devotion. These mismatched themes work surprisingly well together, and we soon realize that the music of Swan Lake does suit the atmosphere of a horror film.A film like Black Swan is rare: it is as nightmarish as it is exquisite, as disturbing as it is beautiful. It explores not only the duality within every person but also the fine line between hallucinations and reality. The film takes us to intimate places with Nina and we cannot help but empathize with her, making the film, though over-the-top (and intentionally so), seem frighteningly real.",10,1,3,9 January 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino is an expert at balancing humor and violence
","Inglourious Basterds begins with the words 'Once upon a time,' and, like any classic fairy tale, it features a daring quest (assassinate Adolf Hitler and other Nazis), brave heroes (the eponymous Basterds), lovely dames (a German actress and a Jewish cinema proprietress who help with the quest), and a scheming villain (the deliciously evil SS officer Hans Landa). Unlike most fairy tales, though, the film has buckets of blood and very explicit violence, it changes World War II history completely, and it does not have a happy ending for all its characters—in fact, the ending is rather muddled and rushed. If you can abide these aspects of Inglourious Basterds, then you are in for a very entertaining two and a half hours.The film is divided into five chapters and consists of two separate story lines, making for a jumpy narrative that is at times hard to follow. One storyline is about the Inglourious Basterds, a group of Jewish and other anti-Nazi soldiers led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt). Their goal is to avenge themselves against the Nazis because 'Nazi ain't got no humanity,' though they themselves are also performing unspeakable acts of violence, such as scalping one hundred Nazis each and carving swastikas into the foreheads of the Nazis they allow to escape. Though the film is named for them, the Basterds serve mainly to unnecessarily complicate the plot and provide shock value and comic relief.The second, more developed, and more serious storyline follows Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a young Jewish woman who, years before, had escaped the murder of her family at the hands of Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz). She has changed her name and is now living in Paris as the proprietress of a movie theater. Like the Basterds, she also wants revenge against the Nazis, and she sees an opportunity when her movie theater is chosen to be the venue of the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film.Both Shosanna and the Basterds plot to assassinate Hitler and many high-ranking Nazis who will be in attendance at the premiere. Neither party knows about the other, which really defeats the purpose of having two story lines. The suspense builds up to the extreme but never quite amounts to anything.Despite its flaws, though, Inglourious Basterds stands out as a very unique and enjoyable film, with doses of great comedy and action and a screenplay that took over a decade for director Quentin Tarantino to write. One of the film's strongest points is the acting, especially that of Christoph Waltz, who plays the villain with so much natural talent and ease that it is hard not to like him (is an Oscar nomination for Waltz on the way?). Most of the dialogue is not in English, so viewers must read captions when characters speak French, German, or Italian (the Italian sequence is, by the way, perhaps the most hilarious scene in the entire movie). The use of multiple languages, the large cast of characters, the complexity of the plot, and the quick pace warrant a second viewing of the film. Watch it once, or watch it twice, but this deranged fairy tale is worth your time.",10,1,7,28 December 2010
Shutter Island," A beautiful film that changed my life
","Continuing their string of box-office hits and critical successes, legendary dynamic duo Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio are back together again in their fourth collaboration, Shutter Island. DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal investigating with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), the disappearance of a murderess from a maximum security hospital for the criminally insane located on sinister Shutter Island. The hospital staff, headed by Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), seems to be hiding something, and with increasingly eerie occurrences and a fast-approaching storm, it is apparent that time is running out and that there are ulterior motives for all on Shutter Island.Flawless, powerful performances from DiCaprio, Kingsley, Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, and the rest of the cast, as well as a quick-paced, no-nonsense screenplay adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, make for a gripping, dark thriller. The music, none of which was written specifically for the film, remarkably, is one of the most noticeable aspects of the film. Music plays an important part in establishing the tone, at times taut and ominous and at others beautifully tragic. These elements combine with director Scorsese's incredible attention to detail to produce pure poetry on screen.The psychological thriller is a considerable departure from Scorsese and DiCaprio's usual repertoire, but together they have redefined the genre and expanded its boundaries. As genre films go, Shutter Island is not at all a typical movie but rather an experience, an honest, elegant, and heartbreaking portrayal of the human mind and memory that means so much more than the story or twist ending itself. And this twist ending, the hallmark of the thriller genre, has disappointed some viewers because it was not intended to be shocking in the way of The Sixth Sense's 'He was dead the whole time!' or Psycho's similarly scandalous revelation. Instead, the ending was meant to shed some light on the beautiful enigma that is the human mind.Despite this quiet contemplation of life's big questions that Shutter Island entails, the film is still enthralling, a thrill ride from start to finish. It does what many other films of its genre fail to do: achieve a perfect balance between the psychological and the thriller aspects. The film seemingly transports viewers to the island and allows them to walk in the protagonist's shoes like no other movie has done before. However, the plot moves in so many different directions that it becomes mind-bending and, at times, difficult to follow.DiCaprio, front and center in the film, steals the stage with his beautiful portrayal of an anguished man searching for answers and piecing together his own fractured past. The film itself is also like a puzzle; viewers gather pieces of it as the film progresses, and some (who feel that the ending is not enough of a twist) may put it together more quickly. However, by the end, when the puzzle is completed for everyone, the image that is finally presented will still differ for each viewer, for the pieces may fit together in any number of ways. It is a film that connects deeply with its viewers and completely engages them; because it is relevant on so many levels, it allows for each person's own interpretation of its true meaning.At the same time, Shutter Island pays tribute to the great Alfred Hitchcock, master of the psychological thriller, and is also suggestive of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. Like the latter's secluded hotel, Shutter Island's insane asylum is the perfect place to depict shattered lives and crumbling reality. This very tender, complex, and human film will leave viewers bewildered and overwhelmed with the contemplation of how some actions can change our lives forever, how we can never quite escape the past.",10,1,3,28 December 2010
Burn After Reading," Quirky characters and A-list actors
","Murder, blackmail, espionage – and this is a comedy? But Burn After Reading, the Coen brothers' latest film, is hilarious. Joel and Ethan Coen, who directed the movie and wrote the screenplay, have created an ensemble of wacky, egocentric characters whose worlds collide with disastrous results after a computer disk falls into the wrong hands.Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) are clueless, greedy gym employees who find the disk containing personal and ­financial files of Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich), a CIA analyst who quits his job after ­being demoted. Linda and Chad are sure the data is top-secret government information, and since Linda needs money for cosmetic surgery, they ­decide to blackmail Osbourne.Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney) gets tangled up in the mess too. He's involved with Osbourne's wife (Tilda Swinton) and Linda – and he's married.Burn After Reading may initially appear to be a lighthearted comedy, but, as Chad puts it, 'appearances can be ... deceptive.' The Coen brothers wrote the screenplay while they were writing No Country for Old Men. In both movies, the deaths of innocent people are not taken very seriously, and there are no consequences for the killers; so the ending of Burn After Reading is unsettling for me.Why is this movie doing so well at the box office? The answer is simple: big names. I admit that my main reason for seeing it was that it was done by the Coen brothers. As for the actors, I don't think the characters would have been as amusing if they hadn't been played by A-list celebrities; at least Chad (the funniest, in my opinion) wouldn't have been as funny. He is the epitome of idiocy and artlessness, and yet, audiences love him, because he's Brad Pitt.Overall, it was the quirky personalities of the characters and the talent of the actors who portrayed them that gave this movie its distinctive quality.",7,1,2,28 December 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A devastating moral lesson
","Reaching carefully through the barbed wire fence that separates them, two eight-year-old boys shake hands. It is a sign of forgiveness and reassurance that they are still friends, but there are no smiles here, for more than just a fence separates Bruno and Shmuel. Bruno is the son of a Nazi commandant, while Shmuel is a Jewish prisoner in a concentration camp close to Bruno's new home. It is the ultimate forbidden friendship and one of the many clichés that riddle The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and make it less of a historical film than a parable about the dangers and devastating consequences of inhumanity and immorality.As the film opens, Bruno (Asa Butterfield) and his affluent family prepare to move from their old estate in Berlin to their new home in the countryside, which they have acquired because of Bruno's father's promotion. Bruno's father, Ralf (David Thewlis), is the conventional Nazi soldier: harsh, brutal, and uncompromising. His wife, Elsa (Vera Farmiga), is his antithesis and a stereotypical, meek, emotional, and ignorant woman. Tension develops in their marriage when they move to their new home, nearby a concentration camp, because Elsa is concerned about their proximity to the death camp and objects to Ralf's 'evil' work.Bruno eventually finds his way to this concentration camp, which he believes is a farm, one day when he is exploring, his favorite hobby. There, he meets a boy his own age, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon). Though Bruno thinks Shmuel is a strange farmer who wears striped pajamas, they quickly befriend each other, for both of them are lonely. When Shmuel tells Bruno that he is a Jew, Bruno decides to keep their friendship a secret because of his anti-Semitic education and upbringing, yet at the same time he finds it hard to believe that all Jews are evil. On the other hand, his older sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) succumbs to the brainwashing and proceeds to hang Nazi posters on her bedroom walls. She abandons her dolls, for she believes she is not a child anymore, and stacks their naked plastic bodies in a pile eerily resembling the heaps of corpses so commonly found in concentration camps.Heavy with symbolism and filmed with a whimsical, fairytale feel, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas follows Bruno as he is placed in adult situations, forced to confront the emotional disintegration of his entire family and to reconsider his own beliefs after his life-changing experiences with Shmuel. The characters, like the dialogue, are simple, predictable, and placed in unrealistic situations, yet they are also well-developed and compelling. This is because the film is not so much an attempt at historical fiction as it is a tale with an important message. Thus, one must not expect this movie to be heavy on historical detail; instead, it uses the Holocaust mainly as a convenient backdrop to convey the moral of the story, that we are all human and deserve to be treated as such.The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is different from most other Holocaust films because it is viewed through the eyes of a child and effectively utilizes this perspective to demonstrate its purpose. Bruno's innocence and naïveté parallel the ignorance of the general population during that time period as well as the modern-day incomprehensibility of how such a terrible thing could have been allowed to happen. The film also stands out in its focus on the impact of the Holocaust on not only its victims, the Jews, but also its perpetrators, the Nazis. Despite the minimal shock footage of the Jews in the concentration camps, the film, with a twist ending, powerfully conveys its warning message with a sense of utter destruction and sheer hopelessness.",7,2,3,28 December 2010
Taken," Predictable, unoriginal, and unbearable
","'I told you so' would be an understatement for Liam Neeson's character, ex-CIA ­operative Bryan Mills, in the film Taken.Mills retires from his job to spend more time with his 17-year-old daughter, Kim, who now lives with her mother and wealthy stepfather. Kim plans to travel to Paris and seeks her father's permission, but he is worried about her safety. Kim's disappointment and the anger of his ex-wife convince Mills to change his mind.However, almost as soon as Kim arrives in Paris, she is ­kidnapped. Now Mills is faced with his worst fear, losing his daughter. He uses the skills he learned from his job to track down her captors.Taken does not have much of a storyline (and what little plot it has is clichéd and predictable). Nor does the film ­feature original, developed characters; the audience is forced to put up with the seemingly ­superhuman Mills, his spiteful ex-wife, the naive, spoiled Kim, and the inept 'bad guys.' Consequently, Taken relies on action and some suspense to engage its ­viewers. Perhaps the best scene of the movie is Kim's kidnapping, in which the element of suspense is ­executed very well.Unfortunately, the strengths of the film are negated by the ending, which I can only describe as terrible. There is a complete change in mood, and there is no transition for the change to make sense. The ­finale also leaves many loose ends and seems to question the audience's intelligence with the amount of liberties it takes.Bottom line, expect a mildly entertaining action flick with one-dimensional characters, a dull script, and a predictable plot.",1,5,13,28 December 2010
Avatar," Watch 'Dances with Wolves' instead.
","James Cameron's highly anticipated epic, Avatar, raises the question: Are special effects enough to launch a new era in filmmaking? In terms of storyline, the plot offers nothing new: once again, greedy Americans are exploiting new lands for valuable resources, and disturbing the natives. The protagonist, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), works for a big corporation but soon finds himself befriending the natives, falling in love, and growing distant from his people because he identifies with the natives' way of life more than his own.Sound familiar? That's because this story has been recycled time and time again. We see it in our history in the settlers' treatment of Native Americans, and it is the plot of the 1990 film Dances with Wolves. Cameron has acknowledged Avatar's similarities to Dances with Wolves, which won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Taking into account that Cameron's own Titanic won 11 Academy Awards, you can see where this is heading.In Cameron's rendition, the natives are a species of alien called the Na'vi. Essentially, the aliens are a gimmick; aside from their sparkly blue skin, extreme height, and tails they are completely uninspired reincarnations of Native Americans. The Na'vi even dress like ­Native Americans, use bows and arrows, live in close-knit family tribes, are spiritually connected to nature, and are threatened by the imperialistic, capitalistic white men because they stand in the way of precious resources. With this story set in the future in outer space, Cameron had the opportunity to formulate truly new and creative creatures but instead opted for imitation and unoriginality.Avatar deviates from its predecessors, though, in its simplicity, character development (or lack thereof), and tone. The distinction between good and bad is riddled with clichés and one-dimensional characters that make for a predictable outcome. While the film could have emphasized Jake's moral dilemma, he actually has no trouble deciding his loyalties, showing how Avatar sacrifices reality and the truth about human nature for the formulaic ingredients of a feel-good audience pleaser. At the same time, Cameron spoonfeeds the audience environmental awareness and lessons on the dangers of war, making Avatar preachy and, at times, tedious.Of course, the film is not without its merits. Cameron himself modestly told The New Yorker that his special effects work is 'the most complicated stuff anyone's ever done.' And he has succeeded in creating a new world of sparkling colors, fantastic creatures, and breathtaking landscapes.Does a film this unoriginal deserve the accolades it is receiving from audiences and critics alike? Is it really a breakthrough in filmmaking? Filmmaking is an art with many aspects, special effects being just one. We will see come Oscar time what the Academy thinks, and only time will tell whether Avatar becomes a true classic.",1,16,25,28 December 2010
Titanic," An epic, a classic, and one of the greatest love stories of all time
","What movie comes to mind when you think of compelling, memorable characters, spectacular visual effects, a fantastic score, and a beautiful, tragic plot? What movie has captured the hearts and imagination of people of all ages around the world? What movie has retained its charm and ­appeal for over a decade, and has earned a rightful place in cinematic history? The answer is Titanic, the 1997 film that opened with low expectations and then astounded the public with its massive success. As the highest-grossing film of all time and winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Titanic raises hopes for moviegoers and does not disappoint.First, consider an undertaking so daunting that many would deem it impossible: recreating the RMS Titanic and its fateful sinking. This task undoubtedly required much time, skill, and effort, not to mention a huge budget – at the time, Titanic was the most expensive film ever made. The ship's splendor shines throughout the movie and adds an atmosphere of magic that film sets rarely manage.Another element of the film's success is the superb, talented cast. Most notably, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet give commanding performances as Jack and Rose, the young star-crossed lovers separated by ­social class on the maiden voyage of the doomed vessel. They are cast perfectly; a better choice could not have been made. Along with the rest of the cast, including Billy Zane as Rose's wicked fiancé and Gloria Stuart as Rose at age 101, they allow the audience to join their journey and share in their emotions and experiences. By the conclusion, viewers feel very close to the characters and truly care about them, which is why the movie is so poignant and tragic.So many years after its theatrical release, Titanic still has not lost what made it such a success. This moving, simply beautiful story about fate, disaster, and the power of love has proved to be a timeless classic and an epic masterpiece.",10,11,16,28 December 2010
