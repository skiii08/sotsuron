Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Excellent Film!
","I have no idea why the meta critic score is so low! This film is excellent! The fight scenes were well played out and the relationship between Holmes and Watson is portrayed by Downey and Law perfectly! I would like to make a point that I have read all of the Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels and was extremely entertained. I enjoyed all the references and characters appearances from the short stories and their roles in the film. Also, the soundtrack for the film is unbelievable. They music keeps you immersed in the film! Hans Zimmer really out did himself! If you're an avid reader of the Holmes novels and short stories, you will not be disappointed!",10,4,8,19 December 2011
