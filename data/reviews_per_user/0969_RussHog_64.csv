The Lobster," Where is Jordan Peterson when you need him?
",The Lobster needs to clean its room! WTF? This movie started good and I liked it -but the second half is soooooo slow and lame. Don't preach. Fix yourself.,1,3,8,25 July 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Awesome
","One of the greatest stories ever told gets an incredible sequel. This film pays tribute to the original but does not try to remake, reboot, or launch a prequel. 
The new Blade Runner is a replicant with a long life span - but the mystery that leads him to seek Harrison Ford begins to make him have connection with ideas of love and family. The visuals and world building in this movie rule - and it is a must see in IMAX. Also, the slow methodical probing world building is truly masterful.",10,5,15,7 October 2017
It," Good - but IT needed the adult plot
","The remake of Stephen King's IT is pretty darn good. It has good acting. Well filmed. The special FX are not always great but the actor who plays Pennywise rules. Whenever he is on screen the story really engages - when he is off screen the young leads do a solid job. It is really good to see an actual monster movie in the theaters. We have so many found footage horrible stories, and bad CGI, and weak stories watered down to protect feelings...it is nice to get a straight up child killing Dead Lights thing that disguises as a clown. The film has two key weaknesses - however. One, for the story to have work at its highest level it really needed the adult plot mixed in with the kids. Even a little bit - like in the beginning there is an action that causes the adults to be summoned and then at the very end they unite for the first time in many years. For me, IT deals with adults who have to face that IT happened long ago - and now IT is back. It is a mission critical story element. Second - it should have been set in the 1950s. Either way, it is great to see a monster movie in theaters.",7,3,9,8 September 2017
Hereditary," Cluck - it sucks!
",The only reason I can think of that entertainment industrial complex wants the consumer class to be brainwashed into thinking Hereditary is a masterpiece *when it's not* is because the white women in the film seemingly have everything yet for no good reason they worship a devil king and that alludes to white women who vote Republican. Gasp - shock - awe! The movie does have a few good scares and the woman who plays the mother does a great job! The script sucks. Cluck!,4,7,19,8 June 2018
The Death of Stalin," Brilliant
","Brilliant comedy about the absurdity of totalitarianism. It deals with the final night of former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, and the power struggle that took place between his potential successors. Everyone is scared to speak reality for fear of being caught and punished. As the story progresses, some of the character's learn how to speak their mind freely and disobey the will of the state in order to create a new state - and others fail to learn and sew the seeds of their destruction.After the movie I did a lot of reading about the actual history of the characters and learned a lot of fascinating history.There seems to be a lot of hate on this film for how it portrays the Soviet Union - but I felt it was funny and heartfelt and eye opening. Not propaganda.",9,20,34,20 March 2018
Unbreakable," My favorite superhero origin story
","When I saw this film I was blown away. A beautiful origin story about a hero who unveils his destiny, and the super villain who comes to terms with the pain in his life. A real life superhero universe where the powers are rooted but at the same time exceptional. The final battle where the hero confronts a masked nemesis and is one of the best battles / rescues in superhero cinema. Also, the cast is perfect and somehow Sam Jackson and Bruce Willis transcend their normal personas on screen to leap into these characters.",10,1,1,31 July 2018
Darkest Hour," Blab blbibbity blab blob
",What the heck is this? It starts kinda good but then it's just two old men who yell at each other a whole bunch. Gary Oldman did a good job - but when he talks it sounds like he is going 'Blab blibbity blab blob.' I liked his performance a lot and I am glad he got the Oscar. Even though I cannot understand half a thing he says. The scene in the subway car is corny.,4,3,7,25 August 2018
Passengers," Trash

Us," It's Ok
","I was not a big fan of Mr. Peele's last film and I sorta liked this one more but it's got a lot of problems. The acting is great - but Mr. Peele's vision is just not very good or interesting. There are doppelg채ngers that wreak havoc but the personal story was lost with action over substance and the reversals are predictable. Also, very bad exposition dialogue and some jokes that pull the seriousness of the horror away. However - it's a very unique film with some great nightmare imagery in the final thirty minutes.",7,2,8,22 March 2019
Knives Out," Dreadful
",I thought it would be a witty dark mystery about Daniel Graig as a PI who solves a murder mystery in a mansion. But was wrong. The film has almost no mystery. Much of it takes place outside of the mansion. It focuses almost entirely on a hispanic maid in order to make a painfully obvious political statement about how entitled white people mistreat immigrants. That's it. That's the whole film. There aren't reversals more than props planted and then hinted at later. Plot convenience and terrible writing. The film doesn't even make sense. This felt like a bad draft. My head hurts now.,1,219,503,27 November 2019
The Irishman," Grumpy Old Gangsters
","This is both a Scorcese gangster epic, but it is also one of his faith based movies. It tells the story of an Irish assassin for the NY mob who becomes a bodyguard for Jimmy Hoffa. They become good friends - but as years go by he is asked by his Mafia boss to assassinate Hoffa. The later half of the film deals with the repercussions of the events surrounding the death of Hoffa. The choices we make in life that can destroy our soul - and hopefully God forgives us in the end.",8,3,11,21 November 2019
Aquaman," May it sleep with the fishes
",Aquaman is a terrible movie. It has a bad script. Dumb costumes. Stupid villains. And an unlikeable hero.,1,8,14,16 August 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Funny
",Thor 3 is a very funny film with some amazing action. The best character is the rock warrior who sounds he is from New Zealand. The best scene is when Thor fights Hulk in the arena on a distant planet. Jeff Goldblum plays a funny villain.I do think this movie maybe makes fun of superhero movies more than it pays tribute to them - but at the same time - it's super well made. Chris Hemsworth does prob his best job in the character - he holds the film together nicely and balances out being a hero and a ham. Excellent special FX.Huge waste of Idris Elba.,7,0,5,4 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Michael Keaton is awesome as Vulture!
",Spider-Man: Homecoming is a movie about a kid with super powers who wants to join a super team - but he has to prove that he can learn how to master his powers. At the same time - there is an adult who has chosen a life of crime who has learned full mastery over the technology that grants him powers - and these two are headed for a showdown of good v evil. Michael Keaton is great as the villain - easily the best part of the film. It is just awesome to see Michael Keaton as the bad guy. He delivered all of his lines like a boss and the costume design for his character is fantastic. One could consider this a huge moment in comic pop culture for Michael Keaton to own this film. The story is not that great. There are themes about the 1% and the 99% - but there is very little 'emotion' in the motion picture. However there was a cool reversal at the end I did not see coming.In the end - I don't think Spider-Man was a great heroic film - but it was fun and I would like to see more Spider-Man villains brought to life in this unique cinematic Spider-Man experience. It is a huge improvement from the horribleness of the previous installments - and Michael Keaton was awesome as the bad guy!,7,1,4,8 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Lando sips Colt 45 with Millennials

Glory," Classic
","I understand some of the modern gripes about these sorts of films, but I feel this movie is a lot better than any modern war movie I can think of. The soundtrack is amazing, the acting is fantastic, the writing is exceptional. It actually looks at race, class, and status from an emotionally mature perspective and not an internet troll's personal opinion. Denzel Washington makes this movie work too - this film got him his Oscar and made him a major star.",10,0,0,29 May 2019
Gone Baby Gone," Casey Affleck is an awful actor
",This movie could have been good if the lead was not such a terrible actor. Terrible. And the duo of the private eye and his girlfriend was unbelievable. The script is mostly bad - but it has moments. Some ok reversals in the final few moments. I admit I did not see the end twist. But the lead actor is dreadful and he cannot make a believable lead. It becomes annoying to listen to him and watch his face.,3,0,2,31 July 2018
The Godfather: Part II," The greatest tragedy ever told
","This continuation of The Godfather Saga tells the story of how Vito Corleone rose as an honorable crime lord who cared for his family, but many years later his son Michael struggles to uphold Vito's legacy. It is both devastating and beautiful. The flashback scenes of young Vito are maybe the greatest cinematography of all time. Al Pacino's best work. This is one harrowing tale. Hold your loved ones close. Never let them go. .",10,3,4,6 July 2018
Bird Box," Blindfold me so I don't have to watch this movie
",This is a dumb film. Apparently if you look at whatever the phenomenon is you will kill yourself - but the bad stuff cannot get you if you are inside of a house - or something? So the heroes have to eventually move around outside with a blindfold. What? The premise is not my thing but also the film just kinda sucks. If you ever watch this movie - wear a blindfold. Don't behold the horror of what is on your TV. (The two child actors do a good job. That is why I give 2 stars and not 1.),2,3,8,30 December 2018
Justice League," Pathetic
",Bad story and awful special effects and a terrible villain. I felt sorry for the cast. With the sheer love of superhero films out there what a waste to get stuck on this one. Thank goodness they made a good Wonder Woman movie and a few good Batman films and even Man of Steel was ok. But this sucked. It was better than Batman v Superman but it still sucked.,1,1,3,11 July 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Awesome movie
",Big fan of the book - I felt this movie started a little slow but found its pace and turned into a spectacular telling of The Godfather of fantasy books. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is fantastic. The costumes and sets and props are all spectacular. Builds a real container that the dark lord Sauron sought his ring of power and the complex web of heroes and villains who took action to help or hinder his pursuit. It's solid fantasy that pays tribute to the source material. Magnificent.,10,0,1,6 December 2018
Split," Nice addition to M Night's World
",Split is a strange movie - and one that probably is not entirely advertised appropriately - which may have led to some of the negative feedback. Split is not a horror film - it is more of a mystery thriller but it also a character study in the rise of an evil villain.The movie is about a man who has split personalities - and one of them may or may not be a supernatural force that seeks to unleash chaos. To find out of this supernatural force is real - he kidnaps three women and holds them in a secret chamber until the time is right to find out if his supernatural split personality can rise to devour them.The women are led by a brave heroine who has her own past that is shrouded in sorrow. For when she was a child her beloved father was killed and she was left alone with her uncle - who abused her. She once tried to kill the uncle - but she failed - and perhaps she owes the devil its due.These two character's are bound for a showdown where they will battle one another and find find the answers that they seek to link them to their destiny in life - and what some may have felt was a let down I was highly moved and thought the performance of both lead actors was fantastic. As was the directing in the final moments. There is a super cool plot twist in the very end that blew me away - that the movie takes place in M Night's Unbreakable universe - which is an old M Night movie about a man who discovers he is a real life superhero and the world is full of wicked villains he is destined to combat.Split is not a scary movie - and there are some really badly written scenes. Some of the exposition is textbook highly problematic - but the truth is that M Night can get away with some bad writing - because his name has proved to sell millions of dollars so I let him pass.,8,4,14,5 February 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Ugh - Bendis
",This film has moments but I am not a big fan of Brian Michael Bendis and his weird politics or the inside jokes he filters into work. This film is Bendis on steroids and LSD. Peter Parker is a washed up white guy (hello America) and the future is Miles Morales - a black / latino kid & a white woman (Gwen) who is independent and puts Miles in the friend zone. They rip the classic Kingpin design of Bill Sienkiewicz. I honestly feel this movie was trying to brainwash me or something. I wasn't big fan of the animation.,6,18,58,17 December 2018
Heartbreak Ridge," impossible to watch
",Soooooo terrible. nothing happens. two hours of unlikeable characters and awful dialogue. trash.,1,3,6,21 June 2019
Dunkirk," Amazing visuals, lacks character development
","This movie tells the true story about the battle of Dunkirk - a small town in France taken over by the Nazis and the British soldiers had to be evacuated. The only problem is - the navy is too far away to help and the Nazis are moving in for the kill. So a civilian fleet of ships launches to rescue them.The movie takes place from the POV of three main characters - a pilot, a civilian boat captain, and a solider. There are other supporting characters such as a commanding officer and a shell shocked rescue.The German soldiers are basically never seen - but when they attack the scenes are really harrowing. Nolan does an amazing job with the battle scenes and the epic score that holds the suspense together. But the story never really explores any of the character's enough to have a huge emotional reaction to their success or failures to succeed.I do not know of Nolan did this on purpose - or if there is a lot of backstory left out that will be in a Director's Cut. While I did enjoy the filmmaking I did not exactly bond with the character's and it held the project back for me.",7,4,8,22 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Thanos is great
",Some smart creative choices were made in this movie. Thanos is great. Captures the spirit of superhero crossover genre.,7,1,7,26 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," Decent Action Follow Up to Casino Royale
","This is not the best James Bond movie - but I thought it was a decent followup to Casino Royale. Apparently there were some issues with the script and they rushed to film - but overall I liked it. It has a lot of Daniel Craig's Bond on a quest for revenge against the agents of Quantum (later renamed to the classic Spectre.). Angry Craig Bond is the best. The first Craig Bond film was a great spy movie, this was more of a revenge action film, and the later Craig Bond movies would become a little more Hollywood crowd pleasers",7,0,0,14 March 2020
It Follows," Brilliant Monster Movie
","It Follows is a movie about a monster that is an STD. If you catch the STD - it will follow you as your worst fears until it catches and kills you. The only way to escape the monster is to pass the STD on to another person. If the monster kills the other person - it will come back for you. The monster is ruthless - cruel - intelligent - and a master of fear. Scary!The story is told like a dream - where the rules of the world change slightly as the story goes along - much like how in a dream the rules of the dream will transform and become more abstract as the dreamer get closer to waking up. Some people have complained about the story changing - but I felt it was intentional and pushed the story forward. The tale is also told in a timeless manner - for example - it seems like the 1970's but there is a seashell that one of the young teens uses as if it is a cell phone - or a computer screen. This shows that the world exists in 'any' time - it can be the past, present, or some future. Or some dimension. Or - some dream. It seems to deal with the Jungian theme of the innocent - which is to say - that the fear of the innocent in the Jung archetype is to be in trouble. To be caught. This is a film about innocent people who step forth into the world and are afraid of their actions coming back to haunt them. Much like all of us are at one time innocent - and take the first steps into being an adult - and fear what may come from that breakthrough. The soundtrack is eerie - and it makes the movie feel a bit like The Shining - or even There Will Be Blood. The shots are well set up - and in general - the movie is just a masterfully unique experience. I love monster movies and I loved this one. A good monster needs to have a scare that is relevant to a majority of the population and a story that engages an audience. It Follows does just that - and deserves its praise.",9,2,3,19 January 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Like too many marvel crossovers...
",This movie is a lot of fun and it has great moments. It is a delight to see the crossover of Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers meet to battle the veiled villain of the last decade in the Marvel Universe. But IMO: Thanos is not the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe. His motivation is not that awesome - and in a way - by making the universe hang in the balance the film raised the stakes so high it was difficult to really care or believe. There is no real drama at the end because like any comic book...the character's will return. However - the fights are great fun. So - like any great crossover...it was big and loud but not as good as a single edition adventure.,7,3,8,2 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Give Brad Pitt the Oscar
","Great buddy movie about a Hollywood B-List actor and his trusty stunt double on the eve of the Sharon Tate Murders. The script by Tarantino is absolutely fantastic and in my opinion his best script. It never feels like a Tarantino movie until the finale. Brad should get the Oscar for his work as the trusty stunt double who has a problem with the law but is also the authority figure of the film. Hollywood is full of people who gave their lives to the industry who never got the recognition they deserved or had careers cut short, and this movie is for them.",10,69,115,27 July 2019
Get Out," White people are up to no good - as usual!
",This movie is about a black man who dates a white women - and travels with her to white suburbia to meet her white family. The white family turns out to be rather sinister. There are a lot of racial innuendos and there are even two strange black people who work on the property that may or may not be hypnotized slaves. What horror awaits our young hero? Turns out this white family wants to control the bodies of black people to use as vessels that elderly whites can pay them to transfer their minds into so the elderly white can cheat death and live in a young healthy black body. The only problem I had with the film was the writing. Terrible writing for plot convenience to help the writer push his plot forward without having to make any sense. The lead actor in the film - Daniel Kaluuya held the story together. I just wish he had been given a slightly better script.,7,7,22,26 February 2017
A Quiet Place," These people don't snore? I sure did!
",This movie makes no sense. Apparently if you make noise the monsters get you. so - the people go out in the woods. but when they walk their feet don't crunch the twigs - or rustle the bushes? then the lady gets pregnant - and like - wait what? Yer baby is gonna cry real loud lady. Also - do these people snore? What the heck is going on? If the river water can make it harder for the monsters to hear you...why not go live near the river water?? Nothing in the film makes sense. The CGI monsters are whack. The story is an allegory of overcoming a handicap but it's also lazy story work. Sad this got so much attention. The young actress who plays the daughter does a great job - and I give her a lot of praise for her performance.,4,62,126,14 April 2018
Coco," Story is everything
",Beautiful story about a young boy who wants to be a musician but his family is haunted by the actions of their ancestors and thus he is prohibited. His journey takes him to the underworld where he meets the souls of his ancestors and tries to heal their wounds so he can find his unique voice as a musician. One of Pixar's all time best films and a tear jerker to say the least!,10,1,1,4 June 2018
1917," Holy #$@
","Wow - this is a great movie. It's the odyssey of a young solider's journey to deliver a message to a superior officer in trench warfare WW1. The camera follows the solider has he crosses the battlefields, enemy trenches, ruin villages. He sees distant combat and deals with his own battles. The cinematography is haunting, great acting, and despite very little dialogue the writing is masterful. One of the best war movies I've ever seen.",10,1,4,26 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Good to see Luke back
","I thought this film was far better than the previous two. Luke Skywalker returns (this is kind of a big deal) and Mark Hamill does a great job bringing the character back. He deserves a lot of credit for his work. This is the first Star Wars movie I have seen since The Return of the Jedi where there were actual stakes involved in the jeopardy of the action scenes. Basically, characters had clear goals and there was suspense over whether characters would live or die. It is not a perfect film, there is some trans-media marketing at work so not all questions are answered. Some storylines happen for convenience - but there is a lot of good stuff in the film. Highly recommended.",1,14,36,16 December 2017

Midsommar," Great start - weak finish
","I thought this movie started off really good - but the end was sort of a dud. The main actress is incredible but the story never allows her character to take a strong action that makes the audience care about her fate. For where they went with the plot - why not make the boyfriend a really strong presence and she's equally strong and the story works the jeopardy back and forth with the pagans pulling them apart. Instead, the character's are superficial and unlikeable. I was told the film would be shocking, but the finale was predicable and soft.",4,6,14,5 July 2019
La La Land," Blah Blah Bland
","What is everyone in this film singing and dancing about? Our story starts off in a traffic jam on a freeway and suddenly everyone does a song and dance number that sets the tone that this film is a colorful original musical about ambitious young people who pursue their dreams in LA. The opening musical number is painful to watch but I assume the story will improve.Our central characters are an actress who aspires to be a famous movie star and a musician who aspires to be a moody jazz pianist. She falls in love with him when she first hears him play his music. He falls in love with her as they begin to date and explore Hollywood. They soon trip head over heals in love and as if by magic they dance with bliss along the milky way. The only problem is - she soon reveals that she does not understand what is so great about jazz. (Wait - I thought she loved his music when she first heard him play?) So he explains the history of jazz and the poetry of the musician. That seems good enough and they continue their starry eyed romance. But her auditions are a bust. No work. Nothing changes. She has to write a one woman play to perform to demonstrate her craft. Yet he lands an opportunity to perform in a big band - the only problem is the music will be more upbeat pop funk jazz hybrid that will make him pretty good money but also take him away from his dreams to be the moody jazz pianist. He sells out to get work - and she stays true to herself and finds no work. This creates a schism and they have a very corny argument about creative direction. He does not understand what is wrong with him making money and traveling and being famous even if he truly knows that it sells out his dreams. She does not understand why she cannot get work even though she stays true to her dreams - and when her one woman show is a dud she decides to quit her dreams and move back home. Our dashing hero feels awful and soon learns that she has one final audition that awaits and so he drives to her home in Nevada to tell her that she must return for one final audition. They travel back to LA - she sings at her audition - and she gets the role. Both have their own careers now - so they split up. Five years later - she is a famous movie star married with children and he has his own jazz club where he lives his dreams as a moody jazz pianist. One night by happenstance - she stumbles into the club and finds him. He plays a solo piano song and she has a dream where their entire love affair is relived only all the choices which led to their separation are made differently and they stay together and have a family and discover their dreams as a couple. Suddenly, she understands what his words meant so long ago - about the history of jazz - the poetry of the musician - now everything comes full circle - and they have a longing final glance. This is all cool - don't get me wrong. But the story itself has been told so many times its clichés are even clichéd. The songs and dialogue are very uneven and at times the film is incoherently stupid. Really - do young couples talk about why they would sell out their dreams to make thousands of dollars a month? Also, the big red flag with the story is that the music simply is not very good. There is not one memorable song or dance in the entire film! Mostly the lights and costumes replace any real choreography or musical number with a unique visual cue. Also, Ryan Gosling is poorly cast as a jazz pianist. It just does not feel real at all that Gosling is so, so sad in LA with his poor dreams of being a jazz pianist so hard to recognize as he dates lovely women.What exactly is the purpose of this film? What was everyone singing and dancing about? Do we live in a world where people can fly down to LA and pursue their dreams with a shot like yesteryear? Or do we live in a world where educational alliances, corporate oligarchy, family connections, and the occasional marriage - determine who gets to shine in the lights? Are we as a people supposed to rejoice that the song and dance of old Hollywood musicals had a tribute film made just in time for the Oscar season? I dunno - this movie does have some strong moments in the script - and it does have some good acting - costumes - and lights - but I just think it's corny and I could not care less.",3,251,491,3 January 2017

The Godfather: Part III," Solid final chapter int he Godfather Saga
","I am glad this movie exists. Glad they went back to see Michael Corleone years after the devastation he endures at the end of Godfather 2. How his empire grew. His sister is still at his side. His ex-wife returns and has to deal with is own children. He becomes a surrogate father for his late brother, Sonny's child. There are a lot of full circle elements to this film. The exterior shots are beautiful. The action is the most of any in the series. It is a very different film from the first two. Less of a masterpiece and more of a love letter to those who loves the franchise. A nice finish.",9,2,3,21 July 2018
The Disaster Artist," 'I did naht like it...I did nahhht.'
","The movie is not as fun as just watching the movie The Room. It does have some interesting moments, such as showing how James Dean famously yelled, 'You're tearing me apart!' and now that factored into the backstory behind the film. It shows how Tommy had a strange amount of money and made a really bad movie with it. The film never really gives us any characters to root for, however. They come across as selfishly motivated for fame as opposed to being motivated to use their powers to help other people. This isn't really bad - it just means its hard to care for the characters. There is also a moving camera, and it gave me motion sickness.",4,61,109,16 December 2017
The Witch," This movie is 'Ye olde stupid!'
",It seems that somebody in the elite artistic community wanted to launch a new type of horror movie - and so they made a historic horror movie. What would happen if a horror movie took place in a historic period of time before modern audiences - such as the woods of Salem in the colonial era? Where - there may or may not - be a witch. The film is partly a historical look at life in this time period - and to make the historic elements seem real the movie is filmed without artificial light - just natural sunlight and candlelight. The dialogue is written from the time period - and that is pretty cool at first but it gets hard to manage as the film goes on. However - the witch portion of the film (the most important part) goes from brilliant to less than masterful. Apparently you need to be well versed in the lore of the Salem witches - and in fairness I am not.It seems there is a witch in the woods and I guess the witches want the heroine of the film to join them? Something to do with Satan and a chicken and a goat. I think that either the film needed to really explain the rules of the world of the witch or use more of the witches - but there was a huge gap in communication between the story and the audience that felt vexing. A horror movie - by and large - if it is going to be successful - needs to have a scare that is viable to a majority of people and a premise that is marketable. Jaws makes us scared of water - and the shark is a cool monster. Paranormal Activity make us scared of our house after dark. Freddy make us scared to go to sleep. Michael Meyers reminds us that the boogie man is real. Most of us do not have a viable connection to a Salem Witch - so it is hard for most of us to understand or care about that. But this film did make it into theaters with a small budget and it did generate enough sales to warrant it a big success so congratulations to those involved - and I am sure the next film from this filmmakers will be more viable to more audiences.,6,1,3,17 December 2016
War of the Worlds," Good moments
",The first half of this movie is pretty awesome. Tom Cruise is not perfect for the role of a blue collar dad but he does not do a terrible job in the film. Some of the script is not perfect. But the alien sequences are masterful. The visuals of them destroying the world are underrated Spielberg classics. The final half of the film is not as good the first but maybe one day we'll have an even better War of the World's movie?

Joker," The Clown Prince of Whine
","My review has nothing to do with the phony controversy. I felt this movie, as a stand alone, was mediocre. The aesthetic of the film was well made. But, the acting by Phoenix annoyed me. I kept waiting for The Joker to show up - but he was very whiney and lame. The writing was not very good. Lots of plot convince. However, if they expanded on this universe and made it more interesting this could serve as a good origin story. I would like to see a Joker v Batman movie with this versions of Joker to expand the lore. Hopefully that comes.",6,11,40,7 October 2019
It Chapter Two," IT...sucks.
","I didn't like the first one but it at least had a cohesive story. This was truly bad. There are moments the child actors show back up and the film returns to good cinema - but the adult cast has no chemistry and their storylines are all rushed. The shots are sloppy, the CGI is bad, and not enough of Pennywise. Many of the scares rehash scenes from the previous film. The lore King's book is essentially dragged into the sewer to die. So many things wrong with this lazy awful movie. SMH.",2,4,8,7 September 2019
The Wrestler," One of the best movies ever made
","This great American drama is held together by Mickey Rourke's performance as a professional wrestler who is a dumb hulk with a big heart. He gives all of his love to his fans with his wrestling - and they give him all their love in return. Tragically, he suffers a heart attack and now he can no longer wrestle, and so he is left alone in a world where no one loves him.He seeks companionship.Everywhere he goes the companions he seek reject him. His neighbors. A stripper. Even his own daughter. One day the stripper - who also has a big heart but exists in an industry where she cannot love her fans and her fans do not love her - takes a leap of faith to reach out to our hero. She agrees to spend time with him and encourages him to reconnect with his daughter. When he does - as if by miracle - the daughter accepts him back into her life. For a few brief days - he seems to be able to find love and accept the loss of his career as a wrestler. Unfortunately - just when real love seems to surface these people fail to connect: He makes a pass at the stripper at the wrong time. She rejects him. He overreacts and verbally abuses her and then abuses drugs. The drugs make him miss out on a mission critical date with his daughter. The daughter overreacts and lashes out on our hero and throws him out of her life once again. The loss of love is sudden for all of them - and they are left alone.Soon it becomes clear that our hero has destroyed his family - not once - but twice - and perhaps more times than that. He can only love to his fans - because that is the only world his talents as a big dumb hulk provide companionship.Our hero decides he will go back into the ring to wrestle - even if it costs him his life. He would rather die in front of the fans who love him than be left alone in a world without love. But the stripper has a change of heart and reaches out to heal him one final time - but the damage done is too severe and he has to let her go so she can find a man in her life who will not harm her. He enters the ring - for one final match that may cost him his life.On the one hand - this film is an allegory to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ - where our hero is a Christ-like figure who is beaten and mocked on his way to be nailed to a cross. But on the other hand this is also a film about the lives of damaged human beings - the love that burns deep inside of them - and the struggle for their love to be recognized in order to find companionship. It is perfect.",10,0,0,15 November 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Monkey no good!
","Kong of Skull Island is a movie about some soldiers and some government officials and a tracker and a photographer who go to a strange island and meet giant creatures. Most the creatures are neutral - some are evil - but one is a good creature and his name is none other than King Kong. The classic movie monster of the ages. In a reboot. Again.The soldiers decide they want to kill King Kong - basically because their commander is angry that the Vietnam war is over and now he sees a new enemy. After all - the war can never end in his mind. So this commander - and his soldiers - set forth a series of events that will sew the seeds of their own destruction as they go to war with Kong.But - the tracker and the photographer meet a slew of interesting tribal folk and they soon learn that Kong is like a force of nature - his existence must be protected or else evil creatures will rise from the decay of the Earth to unleash destruction. They choose to help Kong.The plot sounds cooler than the movie unfolds. The main problem is that the CGI battles start big and this never gives the movie a chance to reach a climax. Kong fight man. Kong fight squid. Kong fight giant lizard. Kong help ox. Kong help woman. Kong love woman. End.Also - the commander who battles Kong is played by Samuel L Jackson who basically becomes a parody of himself. It's as if the director said, 'Can we just have Samuel L Jackson versus King Kong - and say everything cool that Samuel L Jackson would say?' To me - that is a parody that steals a lot from what could have been a great character.This is basically just a dumb American video game that rips off a lot of script and crossroads moments from other successful war films. There is never any time to emotionally bond with King Kong - or anyone else in the movie - so it's all action and no story.There was a giant spider that was creepy. I almost wish this movie had been about people who crash on an island full of giant spiders.",4,9,19,14 March 2017
Inception," Mind Heist
",I love this film. It's a heist movie that takes place inside of several layers of dreams. The script is fantastic. The cast is wonderful. The music is masterful. We can plant a belief in someone and it will take a life all of its own with devastating results. This film haunts me. One of my all time favorites.,10,0,0,18 July 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Awful
",Kenneth Branagh is awful as Hercule Poirot. His accent is dreadful. His fake mustache is a mess. The whole movie sucks. Dreadful.,1,3,7,27 August 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Belongs on Mt. Rushmore of Cinema
","This film is about an 'innocent' man who goes to prison for the murder of his wife. In prison he makes friend with an inmate and their friendship develops over several decades. He learns how to survive. Endures long hardships. And accepts responsibility. There is an incredible reversal in the final half hour of this movie, and I remember when I watched this in the theater - I have never ever seen a crowd in a theater cheer louder in my life. This is one of those movies you can watch a million times and it never gets old.",10,0,0,29 July 2019
Parasite," Great Movie
",I had no idea what to expect going into Parasite. Pleasantly surprised. It's about a low income family who deceives a wealthy family into hiring them - and soon the low income family weeds into the wealthy family's lives and begins to take complete control over them. But all is not what it seems - as the wealthy family's house harbors a dark secret. The script is excellent. You really care about all of the characters and you see this complex situation from every angle. One of the best movies this decade.,10,13,20,17 November 2019
Black Panther," Unique superhero adventure
","Black Panther was super cool. The actor who plays the lead does a great job. The unique sets and costumes of Wakanda were a treasure and hopefully we get a lot more major motion pictures with diverse cultures that can fill the screen.The film has a great moral dilemma about how a king from a wealthy African nation faces his inner demons when he deals with a deadly relative who has been subjected to the abuses his people face in the western world. The Black Panther costume is great, too. Another Marvel masterpiece! Worth seeing in 3D or IMAX.",9,26,105,17 February 2018
Mother!," Zero stars
",This is an allegory from the Bible - or something. I think the husband is supposed to be God and he is cruel and wants people to forgive his cruel decisions. The woman suffers. But nobody suffers worse than the people who watch this film. Cause it sucks. Everything in the film sucks. Lazy awful movie. Worse than that crappy movie this guy made - Noah. It's just dreadful.,1,1,3,21 July 2018
Creed II," Where was the Rocky theme?
","Creed 2 is a movie with a great moral message: You cannot heal your wounds from the outside, you have to heal them from the inside. Ivan Drago returns to avenge his defeat in Rocky IV by having his son battle Rocky's protege - Creed. Creed believes he will heal the wound of his dead father if he defeats Drago's son, but this mistake nearly costs him his title and his soul. Every time Stallone and Dolph are on screen together is superb. Mostly, I enjoyed this film but I dock it a star for not a good use of the Rocky theme.",7,0,1,27 November 2018
Casino Royale," Brilliant Bond Reboot
",Daniel Craig's first Bond film is a masterpiece. It is a very complicated plot - but once you understand it - the journey of the spy's quest to foil a plot by (Quantom/Spectre) the enemy agents it's really a great story. There are a lot of enemy agents and each one of them has a highly complex motive. Bond takes them all on. He has a major babe that he puts the moves on. This is a look at Bond more like how he is in the books - with some tragedy and depth. Also - some of the best musical scores in the series.,10,2,5,14 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Meh
",This movie is about a kid who wants to be a Nazi but deep inside he's a more heroic person. The temptation to become a Nazi is represented by his imaginary friend Adolph Hitler. The kid finds a Jewish girl his mother is hiding in their house and he has to choose whether to turn her in or not. The film at times is funny but it also has many flat moments when the adults aren't on screen and it doesn't work as well it should given the gravity of the subject matter- it also too many goofy woke-tropes that take from the emotional realism.,6,7,16,15 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Horrible corporate disaster - Han Solo and Chewie were cool
",This is a soft reboot of the original Star Wars - but it lacks any of the emotional journey of the original film. All the new characters are dull and lifeless - especially the teenage Darth Vader wannabe guy who pouts like a loser. The only part of the film that is good is when Han and Chewie are on screen together - and honestly - this entire film should have been about them. The plot should have been: Luke sends Han and Chewie to find a new Jedi - but the Empire is after this Jedi too - and it was a race against time. Instead - it was a lifeless dull soft reboot. (Yawn.)Worse - the lightsaber fight is really bad. (WTH?!?)I am sick of my favorite brands from childhood now in the hands of corporate creators who water down the stories - and make bad movies.The new Star Wars is no exception.,2,24,29,24 October 2016
Life," Lame
",Normally I like monster movies - but this movie was pretty dumb. It's a bunch of astronauts on a space station investigating the first sign of life from outer space. The life turns out to be a predatory CGI thing that is forgettable and dumb and then there is some back and forth monster stuff and it ends with a reversal that is not very scary. I do not understand why have astronauts as character's if they speak like they are teenagers? Or why the monster was so lame? Why make a movie about lame people chased by a lame monster and have a dumb depressing ending with a weak plot twist? How did any of the stars attach themselves to this film - I wonder if the script was cut back in producing or something? It's not very good.,3,0,3,2 July 2017
Green Book," Great performances by main actors
",This is a film about an Italian from the Bronx who becomes a driver / bodyguard for an elite but difficult black musician as he goes on a national tour in the south. Both men confront their inner demons and ghosts as their journey deeper into the south brings them closer together. Less about 1961 and more about how liberals and conservatives see one another in the post 2016 era. The story is very Hollywood but the acting is fantastic. Viggo is completely unrecognizable as the driver. Worth it if you like good screenplay structure.,9,3,6,30 January 2019
Annihilation," It had a few good moments -
","This film should have been better, but there are a handful of good moments in the film. It is about some alien force that exists in a quasi-Garden of Eden and spreads its DNA to mutate life as we know it into something biologically different - more of a mirror world - or a reflection of our own world. And along comes this professor lady with a machine gun and her crew. It's not entirely stated but the professor seems to have some inner journey dealing with her own reproductive biological situation - and her encounter with this alien force delves into that. The dialogue in the movie sucks hardcore and the acting is not very good. The third act of the film is quite strong, however - and so I recommend this movie.",6,2,8,24 February 2018
Incredibles 2," Great fights - OK Story
","This film that takes place immediately after the events of the previous film, but then delve into new territory. The team is in jeopardy of being broken up as the women want to pursue their own destiny and the father rejects his role as the caregiver of their baby. The adventure tests their relationships. The battles scenes are incredible but the reversal is predictable and the villain is not very good. There is a Raccoon that fights the super-baby...and the racoon is the star of the show.",7,1,2,20 June 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson is a good director
","We lost something special in pop culture when Mel was busted for DU and went on a racist rantI. He is a great director. Great story teller. Held the screen down a lead actor. Hacksaw Ridge is his big blockbuster since the arrest, and I thought this movie had some good parts. Not his best film. The combat scenes are harrowing. The fact this is based on a real person is amazing - and wow - what a real life hero. I do think parts of this movie were kinda corny. But, Mel did a good job with it.",7,0,1,24 August 2018
Back to the Future," The greatest 80's movie of all time.
",As a kid I loved this movie. The film has the best foreshadowing of any screenplay I've seen - and all the actors and production are timeless. There are dozens of classic lines. A magnificent score. And a wonderful moral story about a kid from a broken home how saves his family. The truth is - this franchise has eerie symbolism that links to our modern world.,10,0,0,9 January 2019
Sully," It's a good thing Tom Hanks was on that plane
",This movie is based on the true story of how Tom Hanks piloted a plane when it was going to crash - but he perfectly completed a water landing in the Hudson river and nobody was killed. But then - some haters who worked for the airport tried to hurt Tom Hanks feelings - and Tom Hanks was sad. Then he learned to overcome - because he is Tom Hanks. I did not know that Tom Hanks was a pilot. But he is good at acting - and good in this film when he plays himself. The scene where the plane lands in the Hudson is pretty well made. Apparently - Clint Eastwood was there too - because he directed this film. Two Face is also in this movie - but this was before he was Two-Face - and so he still had just one face. I liked this movie. Tom Hanks is a great person. He should hopefully win his fourth Oscar for this film.,7,0,1,13 May 2017
