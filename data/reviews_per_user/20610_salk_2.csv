Minority Report," Hi tech movie with some faults...
","Minority Report didn't fully satisfy me. It left me with a bit of a bitter tongue when it ended, although some aspects were not of my taste during projection as well. I'd say this movie is very ambitious but fails to take off as it should. The frame is more important than the painting in this case. Cruise once more (Impossible Mission I, II, Vanilla Sky...) acts in one hi-tech environment having the most advanced (sometime not so practical-to-use and a bit hard to believe) structures and computers available for doing his job. Some good visual inventions don't just make up for the sometime leaking characterizations. The dialogs themselves seem not to be wonderful either (the greenhouse, the mall) but fair enough generally. The action sequences are as spectacular as you would expect with special care for the fight in the cars factory (I think courtesy of Kawasaky) and the plot captures you from the beginning showing a great potential. Unfortunately not completely fulfilled. It's still a good movie which might have been even better with some adjustments. Despite some flaws, it's recommended. A note: some people can speak Swedish, dear Mr. Spielberg! Would you mind telling me the reason of one traditional Swedish song for children (sm√• grodorna) in the middle of the movie ? :) It was fun though...",7,0,0,7 March 2003
The Emperor's New Groove," Hilarious
","The funniest dialogue ever heard in Disney's animations. Only Mulan might come close but not quite. Technically speaking, nothing astonishing. The drawings of this modern productions are not comparable to most 'classics' (especially The Dalmatians and Snowhite). Some characterizations are truly well done (the dull guy), some others very stereotyped (the witch). The only real bad is the first few minutes thanks to the very avoidable music sequence in full 70's style 'Disco Fever' but it's just that. After this your mouth will just twist again for laughters and no more disapprovement. Highly recommended for every age.",8,1,2,29 August 2002
