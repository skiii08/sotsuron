Walk the Line," It's life and Energy Transcends Forumlaic Structure
","It's strange that someone as unique and original as Johnny Cash would have a movie made about his life that is so formulaic-it was almost scene for scene the same outline as Ray. However, Mangold does something here that most Bio-pic's don't. He narrows the subject matter down to two plot lines, often ignoring other things that would have been interesting, or cool to put in. At its heart this is a love story-a film about the redemptive power of love, true love, problems and all. At the same time its also a film about redemption in general. This is due in part because of a great script, and incredible performances. Phoenix is amazing as Cash. He is not just impersonating him, but adds a level of depth. Robert Patrick was also surprisingly great as Cash's father. But its Reese Witherspoon who steals the show, mostly because I forgot she could act. While the composition of the film is nothing new, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the editing is great. In fact everything about the film is great technically. However, what makes this such a great film is its energy. There is a life to this film that transcends its formulaic nature, and adds a level of emotion that is more than just from the memory of the man in Black. Mangold, Phoenix, and Witherspoon create complex and beautiful characters that we care about, and love despite their faults. And that is the beauty of Cash's life and the message of this film-that Love, from God, from each other, can save even the worst of us, despite of ourselves.",8,2,4,27 November 2005

Monty Python's Life of Brian," Always look on the Bright side of life
","This is a very funny film, and I found it not at all profane or blasphemous, even perhaps to the oppositte. Its a very funny film, very very very funny film, the Python's best, with great scenes, lines, and political material about religion and those who observe it. Its even thought provoking and poigniant; something great and funny from this Oxbridge crew of Docs and professors.",10,1,4,23 August 2001
Dawn of the Dead," If you liked the original at all-stay away from this one
","One sure sign that your remake of a cult-classic and near campy 1970's horror film is bad, is that you make the film you're trying to improve upon look more like a masterpiece, and your film like unintentional spoofing. That is the case with this film, that starts out wanting to be taken seriously, and lost me quickly with a strange choice of music with The Man Comes Around by Johnny Cash during a title montage of apocalyptic footage borrowed from your local Fox affiliate.This film really only has the same idea as the original, everything else is newer. This time there are more people who stay alive (and die) in a shopping mall (though much of the film is outside, taking away the claustrophobic fear of the original) while zombies, that are fast and with a virus (ala 28 Days later) eat people (not the mysterious reason in the Dead series). For those who always thought fast zombies were scarier this movie proves otherwise. Seeing a zombie run is actually funnier than scary. Perhaps that worked in 28 Days Later because it was mostly in the dark, but in daylight it doesn't work. And this film misses all of the important points of the original classic.Gone is the hellishly creepy and dirge like atmosphere, and the social commentary on decadence and racial issues. Another aspect this film loses with fast zombies is that they are now killing machines, not almost sympathetic near humans that aren't all too different from us. The dialogue is just dumb, and the plot is as well. The only part I did like was the addition of a gun-store owner who is trapped on a near by roof, but they manage to mess that plot line off also. Gone also is the character development, bumped up from 4 people to about 20 or so, most of whom we never get to meet before they get eaten.Unlike the original this film stays away from philosophy, and is much shorter, about half as long, as Romero's version. The action is almost boring, it's not scary, and in many ways this film is more vulgar than the original in handling death scenes. The violence and gore was extreme and unnecessary in the first, but here it's just profane. You'll see what I mean. I doubt that you can say Romero's direction was sympathetic, but it was more thoughtful than in this one. And a happy ending? Come on, it's a zombie movie! Quick List: Best Zombie Movies",3,1,3,10 June 2005
Elf," Takes a nose-dive the last 15 minutes
","I was pretty cynical about watching this movie, but not having anything else to do, I did, and was quite pleasantly surprised by the terrific and innocent feel of the first half of the film, as well as some great performances by Farrell and Caan.But something must have happened with the studio, or the script because the last 15 minutes spirals into a terribly contrived and generic Christmas film. Its worth watching just for Farrell, and the magical first half.",6,2,4,3 December 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," staggering, and hauntingly formative film
","I was never really a fan of the novels. Yet, in the hands of Peter Jackson, I can now see why so many others are. Jackson takes liberties to tell the story and give it meaning; about humanity, and greed. Crafting a different ending, and a terrific feel it is one of the greatest directing jobs of a book that I have ever seen.",10,1,1,15 January 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," A terrific Film
","The comparisons to Rocky Horror are misguided. This is far better, and actually is about something important. Mitchell is amazing, and so is the idea. No film has ever expressed sexuality, longing, confusion, or rock and roll, so elequently as this little film.",6,5,7,15 January 2002
War of the Worlds," worst Spielberg in 20 years
","OK, so I haven't gotten soft. This is easily Spielburg's worst film in 20 years, if not his weakest work ever (1941 not included, I think everyone let that one slide). What little interest the film creates in the viewers in the first Â¼ of the film, mostly by sight and sound, quickly disintegrates into a complete mess of failed characters, character arcs, and writing. The special effects and camera work were OK, but nothing compared to Minority Report. Tom Cruise is terribly miscast as a dock worker and the world's worst father, Tim Robbins character has no reason to be in the movie, and Dakota fanning just screams for and hour and a half. The ending, which was pushing it when it was originally read in 1896 just comes up lamer here, with a sappy Hollywood touch that doesn't even try to mean anything but make you feel good. There are three signs that this was a sub-par movie. 1) is that it was boring, I saw people look at their watches a number of times, and a couple even went out to take a cell phone call. 2) The biggest, is making you miss other movies that are better. Signs still is the best alien invasion movie, any of the 'Dead' movies are better end of the world films. This made me even want to watch Independence Day, or the 1950's version of War of the World's, both pretty mediocre films. 3) I noticed flubs as the film went. If all of the electronic devices won't work how is a guy tape recording it? As well as just some stupid logic that somehow no one seemed to think twice about",4,9,25,29 June 2005
Ray," Ray: Powerful yet Lacks Direction
","If there was any film this year I should have connected with it was this one; a biopic of one of the most influential musicians of the past half-century. Yet, I left the theater rather disappointed. The film mostly concerns itself with Ray's inner demons, which alone would have been a good film, mostly associated with the death of his brother and his Heroin addiction, however the film ventures into so many other uncompleted topics (his affairs, the controversy of his music, his part in the civil rights movement, racism, the treatment of blind people, parenting) that the film unwinds into a troubled mess. While Fox does such a pitch perfect job of being Ray Charles that it's scary, Sharon Warren, who plays his strong mother, really gives the strongest performance in the film. The technical aspects of the film are near flawless, though some of the 1940's like elliptical editing to show his road tours was questionable, and the last 10 minutes seems like it was put together in a half-hour. The ending doesn't resolve much if anything, and we're left to find out what happened through the de-facto post script. This film could have been great, and while it's commendable that it shows the bad sides as much as the good (one of the best faces of addiction I've seen in film), its lack of a theme is what this film lacks desperately.",6,1,3,9 January 2005
Saints and Soldiers," Probably the best made film under $1 Million
","The comment posted on the main page link certainly had an axe to grind against mormons. In fact the film itself never at all mentions the LDS church and for all we know Deacon could have been a baptist.  That is all besides the point. The film takes us where a war film has never been before, the religious implications. And it is not overtly preachy. Somehow with under $1 million dollars the director has made a film that looks like an epic hollywood war film, complete with handheld cameras and a few war buddy cliche's. But what seperates this film from the pack is its main character, a devout religious sharpshooter, shellshocked from a raid gone bad, trying to make moral sense of what is going on. The film is also a great war film, and impecably accurate historically. The only sign that the film is low budget is its musical score, which at some times is a bit obtruse, but the acting is superb, and the directions is excellent. 9/10",10,59,87,6 August 2004
