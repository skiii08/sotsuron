The Benchwarmers," Hilarious
","This movie is the funniest movie i have ever seen. Jon Heder is hilarious and the message is great! Although it may not seem funny to many of you adults out there with no sense of humor, but for teens, its perfect!!! Full of fun phrases too such as 'Shouldnt you be home blowing up your doll,because thats all the action that you'll get!' or 'Oh My God! Its R2-D2! (whistle)' The kids in this are hilarious too!There's the kid who spits, and the kid who always gets farted on...and then there's the little guy with the huuuuuuge eyes!! Very memorable movie to say the least!",10,0,4,8 April 2006
