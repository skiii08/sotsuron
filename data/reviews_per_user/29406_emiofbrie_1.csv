The Ring," Unique!
","**************SPOILER ALERT********************I just saw this movie 2 days ago on cable and I had no bad issues with this film at all.This film is one of the few that made me feel such deep empathy for a major horror villian.  The circumstances surrounding Samara/Sadako's childhood and death definitely made me understand why her spirit would want to exact posthumous vengeance.  I would too in her shoes.  My empathy was so great that, on the LiveJournal of someone roleplaying as the character, I commented that if she ever came for me, I'd go so far as to help her out of the monitor (I viewed the video on QuickTime) and just give her a hug so she knows that someone out there actually cares, and if she still feels she needs to kill me afterwards, then at least she knows she has friends out there.  I dunno, maybe I'm just weird that way.I just ordered 'The Ring', 'Ring's 0&1, 'Rasen' (the more literally canonical sequel), and 'The Ring Virus' (the Korean version) on DVD...mark me as a new 'Ringworm', I'm hooked!",Null,0,0,2 February 2004
