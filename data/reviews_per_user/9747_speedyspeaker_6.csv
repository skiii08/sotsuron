Howl's Moving Castle," It was a little too good!
","yes, yes, it was just too good! I absolutely loved it! You should see it! and its music...oh! too good to be true! I know this is all so quick but its all true! voices were terrific, too. My opinion, its probably better than Spirited Away.Diana Wynne Jones wrote the fantastic book, and Hayao Miyazaki made this incredible anime masterpiece cartoon. Its about a young woman named Sophie who is change by the Witch of Waste and turns into a 100 year-old woman. forced to leave her mother's hat shoppe, she sets out to find a cure or even find the Witch again to settle things back to normal. but along the way, meets the handsome but wicked Howl the wizard who is cursed by also an evil spell who also lives in a gigantic moving castle charged but the fire demon Calcifer. Not long, she is living & working with them but also getting involved with tough situations in their lives, especially with Howl's... but, in fact, Sophie is falling in love with him! so maybe Howl isn't so wicked after all. could love break both Sophie's & Howl's curse? could it just possibly stop the war Ingary, the land they live in, is having? well, you'll just have to watch it & find out! it may be confusing but, don't worry, I'll give you a quick spoiler: the story is a lot like world war II!anyway, I highly recommend you see this, for both children & adults!",10,4,6,5 March 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," We walk through the wonderful wardrobe at long last!
","What I mean by that is that C. S. Lewis' The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe is FINALLY on big screen. I'm so happy and relieved.I very much loved the film. Immediately, I say go see it. I say it is an INSTANT classic. Everything, honestly, about this film is wonderful: The acting, the music, the animation, the scenery, etc. See, I'm not displeased at all.I always loved the BCC form of The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe and the cartoon. but it was so truly cool to see it like this. If Mr. Lewis was still alive, I... believe he would really like this one.Now the actors and actresses were all very excellent. The children and teenagers who played the four Pevensies (Henley, Popplewell, Keynes, Moseley) are very good at acting, really. Swinton makes a perfect fit for the tall, calm and cruel Jadis, the White Witch. And Neeson does a wonderful job for the voice of the divine, strong but loving Aslan, the lion and the King of Narnia.I'm so pleased with everything about this film and, most of all, just happy Narnia's has gone to theaters after all this time and I hope they will make the fellow sequel books into films too. Here they are: Prince Caspian, The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse And His Boy, The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. Its absolutely an excellent film, please see it with your family... And if you don't know, there are secrets deeper into the story then you think, huh? Try to find them out.",10,6,8,28 December 2005
Corpse Bride," Immediate classic, one of the best!
","This films is truly a immediate classic, plus it's so beautifully made, well organized, and just the best. Even though Tim Burton has made some dark films in the past, this a truly less dark. The story is based in France or England where a shy young man, Victor (Depp), is going to be married. His fiancé is Victoria (Watson) a pretty nice girl who has the meanest parents. At the rehearsal of their wedding, Victor is so nervous, he forgets all his vows. So they cancel the rehearsal till he learns and remembers them. One point, he is in the night of the forest, practicing them. He has the ring with him. He finishes his vows correctly, then puts the ring on a twig as if he were putting it on Victoria's finger. But by doing that, the twig was a rotten finger, thus he resurrects the beautiful but dead Corpse Bride. She is now his legal wife! He is terrified for a few days but starts to get used to her. Even though she's dead, she loves him. But Victor is worried about Victoria, who he should have married. What will happen to Victoria? What will happen to Victor? What will happen to the mysterious but lovely Corpse Bride? This is really an exciting story, it's a little grim but lots of fun. Well, I recommend you see it if you like ghost stories. But this is for all ages, kids will love it I bet. There's lots of singing (which is fantastic), dancing (skeletons actually dance), and well-picked actors for this movie. Back to music, Danny Elfman did an amazing job, the music is grim but so fantastic. It's really a wonderful film! Tim Burton did an amazing job on this one, its such a classic already!",8,2,4,14 October 2005
The Village," Particularly passionate
","This movie was made by M. Night Shyamalan, and is a most 'particularly' good movie. Its about a village based in about pioneer ages, and their pretty happy out in their forest surrounded neighborhood. But there's only one problem, there there's mythical beasts out in the woods, their very intelligent but do not come into the village if you don't come into there forest. The people have always lived like this and always will. Sometimes, strong people have to guard the entrance of the woods just in case, they also wear yellow because it drives the monsters awaybut, to your horror, the monsters are attracted by the color red. No one must ever wear red, if you find a red berry or flower or just something red, bury it. Of course, people normally get ill, and rare brave people ask the 'elders' if they can go to the other 'villages' across the forest to get medicine to stop sicknesses & even death sense it's a poor village because it might happen a lot. The Stars are Lucius Hunt (played by Joaquin Phoenix) & the main Star heroine, Ivy Walker (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, she's new). Lucius hardly talks to anyone and Ivy is blind. I better stop here so that I wont go telling the end of the story and spoil it all J. but, I really absolutely positively recommend seeing this movie because its one of the best movies ever, best music (I can say that again! No kidding!), best acting (wow!! Yeah!), well, best everything! Its really THAT good, Mr. Shyamalan is really & truly a wonderful film maker for beauty & scariness!! Thank you, M. Night Shyamalan!!!",10,0,2,5 March 2006
Groundhog Day," It is fun and funny
","Groundhog Day is a fun and funny film! We don't own it when I ever have the chance to see it or something, I usually do. I'm not going to write what the story is about this time but I will write how Bill Murray does a hilarious job. Well, whenever he wakes up and discovers its still Groundhog Day, you just feel how he feels. He's so good at it. You feel so sorry for him. And then how he goes through each Groundhog Day is just so funny with Bill Murray. How he puts up with it all and struggles and struggles! I don't want to spoil anything this time so I better stop here.But I defiantly recommended seeing this movie because all you need to know about this movie this that Bill Murray is super funny, people!",7,0,1,13 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," brilliant, but a little undeveloped
","It was very good, it was brilliant, but it was a little undeveloped and a little rushed. Well, it is a very long book, so they had to pile a lot in. I understand. They did'nt want to make two films, but I would'nt have minded though. They could have done it, but they did'nt. Plus they did'nt let all new characters developed completely. So that's what I mean by 'undeveloped' and 'rushed'.But what I mean by 'very good' and 'brilliant' is that it really 'was' a good film--you know it, too. I liked it because it was finally 'The Goblet Of Fire'. Finally this book was turned into a film, finally. The book was my favorite (okay, I did'nt read it, my brother told me 'everything' about it when 'he' read it). Yes, yes it was rushed and all but I really really liked it. So that what The Goblet Of Fire looks like as a film, hah. I wonder if J.K. Rowling would have liked it, well you don't know what you don't know. Even though the new characters of this film were'nt exactly developed, the actors and actresses did a very good job, every one of them.So do I recommend this film for you? Yes, yes I do. Because if you see one 'Harry Potter', you'll have to see them all. And plus this one is probably the most important of all of them so far. Yep, yes it is. So you ought to see it, people, even though it is a little 'undeveloped' and 'rushed'. It is still a brilliant film.",9,0,0,25 January 2006
