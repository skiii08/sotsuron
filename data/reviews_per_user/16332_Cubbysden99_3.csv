Miracle," One of those movies that you want to watch before a hockey game.
","This is the type of movie, that you would want to watch before a hockey game, because it just pumps you up. This movie really did show what hockey is about. It is not only a sport you play, but it is a sport you play with passion and hard work. The story was told really well, and the way they made the goals exactly how they really scored them was really cool. This movie is a hockey classic film. All hockey fans should see it, if you don't then you aren't a real hockey fan. Go rent it for 4 bucks it is worth it. The only things I didn't like about it, is that some parts were boring, they should have put more action stuff and less talking. I give this movie a 7.5 on 10, which is good for a sports movie.",8,0,0,3 July 2004
The Girl Next Door," Elisha Cuthbert is hot!
","Elisha Cuthbert makes this movie great. It was a different type of movie from most romance movies. It was funny and the plot was pretty good, but Elisha Cuthbert is the movie. Elisha Cuthbert deserves better then this. She was the runner up from getting the roll Mary Jane Watson in Spiderman. I would prefer her over Kirsten Dunst.The start of the movie started off perfect, it actually had potential to be a classic, but when they made Elisha Cuthbert a porn star it kind of ruined it, but it was still extremely entertaining.This movie was about a high school kid who was about to graduate and had a huge speech coming up to get into George Town if he won. Then one night he sees the girl next door(Elisha Cuthbert) hot! The effect of the hotness of Elisha Cuthbert changed this guys life. He couldn't get enough of her. He was pretty much falling in love with her. She made him do crazy things and he did them. I mean how can you not! When Elisha Cuthbert tells you to do something you do it! Then eventually they both fell in love obviously and they were good to each other and they had sex in back of a car seat. Yeah I know this isn't the main plot of the movie but watch it and you'll see for yourself, it's really entertaining. As soon as Elisha Cuthbert comes in you'll be like WOAH! Damn you Emile Hirsch you lucky bastard! The cast was actually chosen perfectly because both Elisha Cuthbert and Emile Hirsch no one really knew who they were before this movie. It was a good way to start their big pay movie careers. Look for great things from Elisha Cuthbert and look for nothing from Emile Hirsch he can go pee on himself.Great movie almost a classic 9/10.",8,0,1,10 June 2005
Spider-Man 2," My Favorite Movie of All Time
","Spiderman 2 had everything in it. Here is a list of the things it had.1. A Hero, everyone likes a movie with a hero in it, and this movie had that. 2. Action was definitely in it. Action fans will enjoy it a lot. 3. A love story between Mary Jane and Peter Parker, everyone loves a good love story. 4. Comedy was in it, everyone likes a movie with some jokes in it. 5. A good ending, all good movies have a good ending, and this one sure did.So you see Spiderman 2 had everything, this is definitely the best movie of the year, either this or Lord of the Rings. Spiderman 2 will always be a classic, and I am sure we will see a couple of more spiderman movies in the upcoming future. I can't wait.",9,0,0,3 July 2004
