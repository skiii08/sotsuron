Insidious: Chapter 2," If you loved the first insidious you're gonna love chapter 2!
","When the first insidious came out I thought it was one of the creepiest movies I had seen in years. Wasn't scary enough to keep me up at night but it was pretty damn creepy. Insidious chapter 2 is a direct sequel to the first film, it picks up right where the first one left off. This time around the horror dream team James Wan And Leigh Whannell really toned down the scares and went for a more story based film. Fans of the first film will enjoy this film. I personally enjoyed this more than the first film because a lot of questions I had about the first film were finally explained. At the same time some of the key points were left out hopefully the third chapter will finally explain. Oh yea there will be a third one duh its a horror movie they never stop at 1 or 2. that's the only reason I couldn't give this movie a higher rating. This movie had very strong performances from the 2 leads Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne which is something you normally don't see in a horror movie. If you're looking for a fun time at the movies you should go see this movie. Packed with a lot of laughs and a couple big scares I recommend this movie to all horror film fans. 8/10*but if you have not seen the first insidious do not I repeat DO NOT! Go see this movie until you have you will hate the movie because the plot won't make any sense. So if you do choose to go see this movie make sure you watch the first film.",8,2,4,13 September 2013
Gravity," Alfonso Cuaron has done it again!
","Alfonso Cuaron is behind in my opinion, the best Harry potter movie in the series the prisoner of azkaban and also directed one of my all time favorites children of men but, gravity is one of the greatest sci fi movies of all time! I wasn't around in the 70's to experience Star Wars in the movie theater or around to see 2001: a space odyssey in theaters but I did get to experience gravity in IMAX 3d. The opening 13 min scene in space is so beautiful and sets the pace for the rest of the film. I have never seen a movie so intense and emotionally griping as this one. George Clooney and Sandra bullock have performances of a lifetime. I can easily see these two getting award nominations for this movie. This is the best film of the year so far it's a movie that must be seen in theaters. Some look at the trailer and only see 2 actors and space and will immediately turn away from this film but, this film was directed and paced so perfect. this is a 90 min roller coaster ride that never lets up. You'll be at the edge of your seat the entire movie wondering what's going to happen next. This is a must see movie do not miss this experience. If you can afford to see it in 3d I recommend it the visual effects are so perfect that the 3d adds so much more to the movie. I have never been a fan of 3d but this is just so beautiful. 10/10. Alfonso Cuaron has done it again!",10,5,10,4 October 2013
