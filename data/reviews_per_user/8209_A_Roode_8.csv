The New World," Audiences will be very divided.
","Let me start off by saying that I was introduced to the films of Terrence Malick in 1998 when I watched and was blown away by 'The Thin Red Line.' It is one of the best war movies ever made and while I can rant about it at length, that review belongs on a different page. It was with great anticipation that I waited for 'The New World.' I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening and the theatre was full of people like me. Their take on the film was almost as interesting as the film was.'The New World' is a film that will draw out one of two very powerful emotions: Love or Hate. I really don't believe there is a middle ground in this case. I think it is quite possibly the most beautifully photographed film I have ever seen. It is astonishing. The score from James Horner is, in my opinion, his greatest work. He's a wonderful composer but he has exceeded himself on every level. This is a movie that can be watched like art (because it is) and listened to as a symphony (it might as well be one). Very few movies leave me stunned and 'The New World' is so luscious that I think it is worth the journey, even if it is only to look at how beautiful it is and listen to how glorious it is. Is that a superficial way of looking at things? Perhaps, but they are the film's two most brilliant qualities.'The New World' does have problems and I think it falls very much into a 'buyer beware' category. Malick's movie is long -- very long -- and feels every moment of it. I don't mind these things because I found it enchanting; many in the audience with me did not. These are not people who are 'dumb,' or who 'don't get it.' They are people who are used to 99% of the films that you will see. 'The New World' is very self-indulgent at times. No one can reasonably defend the pace of the film. I want to and I can't. This is a movie so full of substance that it is detrimental. It is so rich and textured that it would be hard to say where things could have been improved, but aside from the first forty minutes which deal largely with the question of whether or not the Europeans can survive the first winter or not, the dramatic 'action,' that is, the engine of a script that pushes one scene into the next, is idling at best. 'The New World' has a plodding pace and it took me on a nice quiet stroll that I enjoyed immensely. I can not, in good conscience though recommend to the man on the street that he go to see it. If less than a third of the theatre I was in walked out, I'd be stunned. I lost count because so many people left. Mostly the middle hour and a half of the film is to blame. Scenes drift from one to the next -- they're stunning and textured and personally I enjoyed them -- but they involved a lot of hanging out. Two people hanging out in the woods. I understand that the film has deep meditative and philosophical meanderings about man's relationship with nature and how one impacts the other. I get it. But a lot of the love story is about two people hanging out in the woods. All the time. If one of them had said 'Let us go watch the grass grow for the afternoon,' it would have been the most honest line in the entire film. It is the only thing I will fault Malick for here because it really does kill the film for a lot of people. His intelligence should not be questioned. I wish only he'd tried to focus the script a bit more and been specific rather than general. Can two people from different cultures be together? We get it already. We got it an hour ago. Oh, more grass growing ... must watch ... ha! Forgive my little joke.The argument to be made though is that this film has not been made for everyone (the studio is no doubt surprised to learn this and will be scrambling to recover their money -- they did a good thing in making it but they're going to lose their shirts). It was made by Terrence Malick for Terrence Malick. I'm glad to have seen it but I spoke with twenty people who were not. There will be constant arguments on the user boards here at the IMDb. The film is going to have rabidly fanatical supporters who think everyone else is just too stupid to get it. And it is going to be criticized by many, many others who died a thousand deaths just trying to sift through the movie.Two final thoughts: the first is that I hate myself for having to say anything negative about Malick or his film. He's a special film-maker and his films make it worth going to the theatre. 'The New World' is great but flawed and it is dishonest for anyone to pretend otherwise -- such behaviour is deceitful and pretentious.Thought number two is that although the film is equal parts challenging and rewarding (as great movies should be) it is especially important in the case of 'The New World' to see it in the theatre. It is so majestic in scope that I don't believe the greatest home theatre can do it justice. It is truly epic in its cinematography and score. If it doesn't win Oscars for both we will have witnessed a massive artistic injustice. NOTHING this year, NOTHING has come close to being a threat to 'The New World' for either of those two categories. Appreciate them as they were intended to be seen.",8,608,761,13 January 2006
Battleship Potemkin," Impressive, moving and rewarding
","Whispered at like some urban legend, 'Battleship Potemkin' is a film epic in the grandest sense. A shame that its influence has permeated so much of film today but that it seems to be seen by few outside of film schools. I'm from the non-film school group, but I know from other films that they have drawn on images and sequences in 'Battleship Potemkin.' To name just three: 1)Extreme close-ups: Eisenstein's use of extreme close-ups are wonderful. He'll zoom in on the face of cruel officers. As a propaganda film he needs to exaggerate the menace and it works extremely well in helping to create sympathy for the sailors. Later during the Odessa Stairs massacre, his close-ups of panicked, helpless and fleeing civilians is heart-wrenching. If you've ever watched Sergio Leone's films (especially 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,' or 'Once Upon a Time in the West') you'll see the obvious influence.2)Editing: There are almost twice as many shots in 'Battleship Potemkin' as there were in contemporary American films. What this meant was rapid fire switches from shot to shot that the MTV generation would approve of. Also, Eisenstein was somewhat unusual in this film's editing because editing for the most part is used to shorten time. Eisenstein was trying to connect an earlier historical even with a later one; his editing extends time.3)Odessa Steps: One of the best and most suspenseful moments in Brian De Palma's 'The Untouchables' is the staircase scene with the baby carriage. That is a tribute to 'Battleship Potemkin' and a longer and similar sequence in it. Czarist troops descend on Odessa and are planning to punish the citizenry for the aid it has lent to the battleship. People flee chaotically down the stairs while the soldiers march as one behind them pausing only to fire into the crowd with their rifles. It is a visually stunning sequence highlighted from both technical and emotional standpoints. Technically, the cuts from shot to shot are panic-stricken and rapid. Eisenstein has an early establishing shot to show the size of the stairs and the number of people fleeing. From there the camera moves directly into the action focusing on individual characters: a woman with an umbrella, a man with no legs, a woman and her little boy, a group led by an old woman who hide at the side of the staircase and a young mother with a baby in a carriage at the top of the stairs.... Eisenstein's manipulation of the footage is nothing short of brilliant. I'll not describe anything else from the 'Odessa Steps Massacre' and add only that it is tremendously moving. All of the characters listed above are 'rebels' and all are dealt with by the soldiers.In my mind, 'Battleship Potemkin' suffers only from the fact that it is so heavy-handedly a propaganda film. Its extolling of soviet values may strike some as too hard to swallow. That said, it is an utter masterpiece and if you are serious about film at all (or if you just want to see where De Palma got his idea!) 'Battleship Potemkin' is essential viewing. It rightly belongs in the IMDb top 250. At the time of this reviews writing, it is mysteriously NOT in the top 250. Aside from the hokey 'brotherhood prevails' message at the end and the heavy propaganda, I think the film has an audience out there today that would respond favourably to it if they only took the time to seek out the film and watch it. If this review convinces even one person to take that time my job is done.",9,1,1,29 April 2006
Capote," A tremendous and devastating film
","I missed 'Capote' in its initial theatre run but was lucky enough to see it in the brief post-Oscar running that it has been given. Seeing it this afternoon was particularly great since the theatre was empty except for myself and three other people. It felt like a private screening. I found 'Capote' ... devastating and an emptying experience. It was a tremendous film and I feel so lucky to have seen it on the big screen.As has been noted in countless other reviews and by the many acting awards and accolades 'Capote' has earned him, Phillip Seymour Hoffman was tremendous and a lot of the film's strength is due in part to his performance. He really did become the part and was mesmerizing. His portrayal presents a man who is dedicated to his art, not unlikeable but perhaps not truly likable by the end of the film either, and a man who is by turns flamboyant, eccentric, complex, manipulative and calculating. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a tour de force and I didn't see a better performance in the past year.Supporting parts are the characters who often make or break a film and someone who seems to have been over-looked in 'Capote' is Clifton Collins. 'Capote' has four chameleon actors -- Clifton Collins, Bob Balaban, Bruce Greenwood and Phillip Seymour Hoffman who always play very interesting (albeit quite often minor) characters. They are the strength of 'Capote' and their constant professionalism in all roles made 'Capote' an even better film. I hope that his work in particular will bring Clifton Collins some juicier roles in the future. I've been a fan for a while now and the horizon is wide open for him. I should also add quickly that Catherine Keener -- always great to see her! -- is quite good here too. She has the most devastating line in the film when she says 'You could have. But you didn't want to.' I'll not say anything other than that because I don't want to ruin things for anyone who hasn't yet watched the film.The ending of the film really struck me. I almost wish they had played the credits at the beginning of the movie, believe it or not. The consequences of Capote's path and actions during the film are thunderous and clearly are destined to haunt him for the rest of his life. The credits would have played well at the beginning because with a final printed statement as epilogue, I think 'Capote' is near to as perfect of a character study as I have seen in a long time. It's silence and abrupt end would have been even more numbing than it already was. 'Capote' is highly recommended.",9,2,3,13 March 2006
Tropic Thunder," Fun in the Sun
","To give due credit, Tropic Thunder is reaching for the stars. It tries to satirize as much of the movie business and the Vietnam-War-film genre as it can. There are high points, such as Robert Downey Jr.'s method actor Kirk Lazarus being so wedded to the character that he can't break free -- even when it has become clearly obvious that they are no longer filming a movie -- or Matthew McConaughey's super agent Rick Peck and his obsession with TiVo. I won't mention Tom Cruise's guest role as a foul-mouthed, iron-fisted dictatorial studio head other than to wonder loudly how things are going over at United Artists.Why then did I feel so unsatisfied with the movie? I liked it. I enjoyed and laughed heartily through most of the jokes. It was as if the individual jokes were all greater than the sum -- a collection of funny punch lines that are a pastiche of laughs but not a satisfyingly funny routine. Part of it is the unwieldy blending of high-concept satire and lowbrow profanity-laced rants. Swearing can be used to high effect and it plays to perfection at times in Tropic Thunder. The best example (and my favorite line from the film) is from Robert Downey Jr. who, after being asked what kind of farm he works on, mows down the bad guys with his gun and declares that 'I'm a lead farmer, mother--' well, you see where I'm going. Initially, Tom Cruise's profanity-ridden rants are funny too. But then you realize that there isn't anything else to the character. His character, Les Grossman, just throws tantrums and screams profanities, a paper-thin joke that works through audacity but wears out after the first rant. After a while the swearing starts to sound like a group of little kids who've just heard their first bad words and think it is funny to yell them over and over again.On the other hand, I loved the performances. Jack Black's focused insanity was pointed in the right direction and he got a great part that he's well-suited to. Stiller manages to play Tugg Speedman with enough vulnerability that you can buy his need for the fictional movie to be a big hit. The scenes from his critical bomb Simple Jack are priceless, as are Downey's explanation of why Speedman would never have won an Oscar for it. Nick Nolte (good to see him again) has a strong supporting part, as does Steve Coogan as the overwhelmed first-time director. The picture is Downey's, though, and wherever Redd Foxx is, I think he would be proud. Scene-stealing, scenery-chewing and utterly priceless, Downey looks like he's enjoying every minute on screen. If you see Tropic Thunder for any reason, watching Robert Downey Jr. should be it.",7,2,7,30 August 2008
The Illusionist," A good little mystery with some very nice acting.
","Although I spotted the inevitable conclusion coming about half way through the film (Jessica Biel and Ed Norton are discussing a possible future together; her pragmatic analysis of what would need to take place set off alarm bells for me that ultimately proved my instincts correct), it is a testament to the film that I was still engaged enough to see how all of the pieces in the story would fall into place. 'The Illusionist' is a fairly decent example of a script that sets up a certain number of expectations and then toys with the outcomes before knocking them all down like dominoes.There are three main reasons to watch 'The Illusionist.' The first reason is that the script isn't too bad. I was with a group of friends. Two of us guessed correctly how the film was going to develop. The other five were quite surprised by the film's ending. None of us were disappointed and the film got an ovation from the audience when it was over. I would describe 'The Illusionist' as a mystery or a puzzle. If you like films that make the grey matter between your ears do a little work, you might just find yourself pleasantly surprised -- that said, there isn't anything so taxing here as to make the film overly complex or convoluted.The second reason to watch this film is the involvement of Ricky Jay. He's in the credits for consultation and as one of the best magicians working today in Hollywood, it is worth your time to take a look at the film to see some of his influence. I'll be interested when this comes out on DVD to find out the degree of involvement. If the producers were smart, they probably listened a lot to a man who is in the Guiness book of World Records for his use of playing cards as weapons! My third reason to recommend 'The Illusionist' is some excellent work from the three main male leads: Paul Giamatti, Ed Norton and Rufus Sewell. As a qualifier, let me add that Jessica Biel does a pretty good job too -- I just found that the energy and zeal with which her male counterparts performed ate up the screen and left her adrift. There's a little joke in there you might find funny after you've watched the film. Ed Norton is very controlled and restrained here, Rufus Sewell seems to relish every scene he's in with villainous delight and Paul Giamatti shines as the police inspector with a taste for amateur magic. Giamatti has a gift for facial expressions and, as a friend of mine hilariously put it, in his final scene his facial expression is 'six degrees of crazy.' I love that! These are three compelling performances and although you might see your way through the contrivances of the script, the good performances should be more than enough to keep you entertained.'The Illusionist' isn't bad. A good little mystery with some nice acting all around.",7,52,80,10 August 2006
Blood Diamond," A great character film with two excellent performances.
","Since there is very little in the negative column, let me disperse with it first: 'Blood Diamond' might fairly be accused of 'bleeding heart syndrome' (more on that in a bit), has a few minor pacing issues and seems unsure with how to end. The ending that they chose extends the film too far, seems forced and is tacked on. The more natural ending is on the mountainside -- you'll know what I mean when you see it. Those things said, the positives are much greater and this film showcased two towering performances. Djimon Hounsou is nothing short of incredible and I'd be astonished if he isn't considered at Oscar time. Secondly, although I've had little patience for him before, Leonardo DiCaprio has really impressed me this year. With his performances in 'The Departed' and now 'Blood Diamond,' I think I need to reappraise my own biases against him. I'm becoming a fan.Some of the early reviews that I read painted 'Blood Diamond' as hysterical left-winger cause-head paradise. They suggest that the conflict diamond situation has been exaggerated and completely distorted. I don't know if that is the case. The film makes a compelling case but I don't base my political and economic decisions on films that I watch. My interest here was to see how characters would respond to adversity and a terrible, horrifyingly dark situation. The political agenda of the film isn't as cloyingly bombastic as I was afraid it might be. This is a film that, while concerned with the political situation in Africa, focuses more on how the obsessive search for a large, rare pink diamond consumes those who get too close to it.DiCaprio is excellent as a Rhodesian (HIS description) mercenary and arms dealer working in Sierra Leone. Hounsou is a fisherman who gets drawn into the civil war raging around him and discovers a pink diamond that could save -- or destroy -- both he and his family. Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist trying to discover if a huge multi-national diamond company is knowingly in the market for conflict diamonds. Jennifer Connelly seems to get the worst of the dialogue. When told that Americans are in part to blame for conflict diamonds she responds with a line about 'not all girls want a fantasy wedding.' It makes her look naive at best and silly at worst. She generally manages to save the character from either of those fates though and also manages to avoid self-righteousness when dealing with some of the films more morally flexible characters. Hounsou is great and the desperation in his character as he tries to find his family crackles on the screen. He is cagey and understands what he needs to do to survive. His character is not above playing servile if that will keep him alive. And when provoked to violence, the result was absolutely chilling. In much smaller roles are Arnold Vosloo as a mercenary Colonel, Stephen Collins as a diplomat and Michael Sheen as an executive at a diamond company. Excellent performances all around.Is 'Blood Diamond' judgemental? I think that is the wrong question. The film is a character study both of all the men pursuing the pink diamond and what effect it has on them, but it is also a character study of Africa. Tragic and heartsick, 'Blood Diamond' is drenched with cynicism and defeatism. Why is there misery and exploitation? 'TIA,' explains DiCaprio to Connelly, 'This Is Africa.' In contrast to a film like 'Traffic,' 'Blood Diamond' doesn't wallow in hopelessness. Some of the characters might be cynical but the film itself does search for hope. The heart of the picture is the human cost. Characters see the wealth of the diamond and are destroyed by it. The film shares a great deal thematically with a film like 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre.' High praise for a high quality film.",9,389,455,10 December 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Time has made this a better film.
","I remember watching 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' when it first came out and being ... dismayed? Is that the right word? The problem was maybe in Francis Ford Coppola's choice of using 'Bram Stoker' in the title. I believe if you just say 'Dracula' it gives you a bit more creative license -- that is, you can tweak with the story for dramatic purpose and won't have insanely idolatrous fans of the book banging on your door at night screaming about how you've ruined the movie. It has taken 14 years for this version of 'Dracula' to finally strike a chord with me. I'm glad it did because giving it another chance was the best decision I've made in a while (I apparently don't get out much and choosing which movie to watch is more challenging than it appears ...).What a marvelous performance from Gary Oldman! His character and performance are deeply nuanced and complex. Is he my favourite Dracula of all time? No, but I think he was very strong in this role. Tom Waits also turned in a great performance (though to be honest he was largely unused and while heretical of me to suggest, his entire story and part could have been cut from THIS VERSION of the film). An actor who cheerfully chews scenery, he shares a memorable early scene with fellow scene-chewer Richard E Grant. Grant is very decent in the film although Waits rather victimizes him. Two scene-chewers on screen at one time are rarely good for anything but comedy and that was not the goal in the asylum. Waits was more flamboyant and deserves credit -- Grant would have been wiser to play it a bit straighter. Hopkins and Elwes were impassioned and very good.What struck me most about this film was the lusciousness and texture. Beautifully (Oscar-winningly) costumed, wonderful score that was brilliantly employed, gorgeously photographed, I could go on. It is from a technical standpoint very good. I love the fact that they employed a lot of older film tricks and looks. The use of the iris to fade in and out, blending different frames of film to superimpose images, using faster and slower speeds -- this film is a breathing textbook. The sets and design are just awesome. I think it is the best work that Francis Ford Coppola had produced in quite some time. Perhaps this titan of film had been sleeping for a while. In my mind, 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' was a sharp reminder that Coppola is a master craftsman and that he is still capable of producing top-notch films.So what would have been his attraction to this film? I wonder if there was some attraction to the notion of Dracula being at the centre of moral and spiritual rot -- Physical rot even. This seems to run through much of Coppola's work and I see it here too. The film doesn't take the easy route though which many of my beloved Hammer Horror films do. This Dracula is not just some monster to stick a stake in. He was human once and (while close) is not totally beyond redemption. And, for the record, the opening scene and back-story is tremendously filmed. Unbelievably atmospheric!There are very tense scenes of menace and horror in this film. There is a cross-country chase scene that is an anxiety-filled race against time and it is fantastically well done. At one point Hopkins must defend himself with fire. Yet another tense and well-done scene. Coppola uses a lot of quick cuts to show the speed of the vampire and while it isn't the scariest film out there, it is still very good.A lot of the flack that this film takes comes from the emphasis on the love story. It was what I remembered most from my first viewing a decade ago and partially why I detested the film so much then. Time has made this a better film for me and I don't mind the love story so much. The film becomes a redemptive tale. Will the rot that I mentioned earlier consume Dracula and everyone he touches or can they, even in the darkest final hours, be saved? We've seen this played out in other vampire films before but not like we do here. 'Dracula' is worth another look. And don't worry: the irony that a film about redemption (which I didn't like) but have come to change my mind on hasn't escaped me.",8,0,1,3 April 2006
Thirteen Days," Very well done.
","Poor Kevin Costner. I get the feeling that he just can't win no matter what he does. He gets slammed for being in films and not using an appropriate accent. Need we look any further than 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'? When he does use an accurate accent, as he does in 'Thirteen Days,' he gets slammed for trying to elevate his game to a playing field dominated by more well liked method actors. I've heard an argument before that he should just stick to making westerns since, allegedly, they're the only films that he does well. Many would immediately argue that 'Wyatt Earp' cancels out 'Dances With Wolves.' I argue instead that people are just too hard on Kevin Costner and 'Thirteen Days' is a very good example of why he deserves a bit of a break.'Thirteen Days' was the fastest two and a half hours that I've sat through in a long time. The film was absolutely engrossing and very tense. Everyone knows what happens (or should be able to infer it since we'd all be dead right now if things hadn't worked out so well) but the writing and direction deserve great credit. They were able to transfer the tension from the historical situation and bring it to the screen with electricity. I think it works brilliantly well for two main reasons: 1. The viewer may know what is going to happen, but the characters don't. They are stressed, terrified and at the breaking point. One wrong move and the whole world is obliterated. If that isn't good drama, I don't know what is. 2. The film makers very wisely resisted the impulse to try and show things from the Soviet point of view. The strength of the film is the peril of the situation and the terror of not knowing what the other guy is trying to do. By filming from solely an American perspective and keeping both the characters and audience in the dark, this character driven movie excels.A second brilliant strategy employed by the film makers was in the casting. With the exception of Costner, there are no real stars. Instead there are more reliable, hard-working and chameleon-like character actors. Len Cariou, Dylan Baker, Stephen Culp, and Bruce Greenwood are just a small sampling. Greenwood plays JFK and excellently plays a man desperate for peace but surrounded by calls for swift military action. He sees the bigger picture where others don't, but may not be able to navigate the smaller picture without help. Dylan Baker is a doppelganger and his performance as McNamara is spot on.Highly recommended.",8,13,14,30 May 2006
