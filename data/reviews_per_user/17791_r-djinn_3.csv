","I can without a doubt best action sci-fi movie ever. Most see.The Action was almost flawless, The 3D effect was awesome, The Acting was great as the actors was great. The comedy was great to it makes the whole movie to fit.No movie is flawless, but what can I say about this guys. I love the actors in the movie I really liked the story. But some scenes the could think about the little thing, I don not want to spoil it and review it you most see to understand. I I don not think everyone sees that little mistakes. But without any regards I will give it a 10 because I have not seen any movie yet that has this good scenes in it. GO AND SEE....",10,3,8,29 April 2012

Man of Steel," I can just say as Superman Fan this movie was AWESOME!
","I have waited over 1 year to see this movie and today I watched it. The movie was great. Great story, great acting, great special effects. I really like the shows us the world of Krypton and the story of Kal-El. I really want to see the man of steel 2. So the all the critics f*** you. How can ppl give score 1 for this movie are you really crazy, eehhh I guess so. The biggest best stuff about this movie is when the action begins from the story it has written. There no such thing for Superman to save everyone and everything thats impossible. It was much more truly about what happened when something so powerful attacks earth. Only thing I can say go and watch the movie with open mind and you wont regret it.",8,4,9,27 June 2013
