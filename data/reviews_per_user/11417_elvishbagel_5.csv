Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Underrated and underappreciated
","This is a terrible movie for a lot of people, but not for me. I grew up with the prequels, so naturally i liked the prequels more than the originals, but things have changed. The main problem with this movie is the dialogue. The line delivery and acting for Jar Jar, Anakin, and sometimes Padme and the other Gungans, is not very well done. The acting aside, this movie is all about building a newer side to the same universe. Many people complain about the fact that this movie is centered around politics and trade disputes. While that is a change from the norm of the OT, this movie uses it to it's advantage. By showing us The Senate, The Jedi Council, and new worlds and species, this movie helps start a new norm as a bigger more diverse universe. The duel of the fates is perhaps one of the best duels in the franchise and showcases Lucas's ability to craft a good duel. The action scenes are well done and the story isn't too bad either. Liam Neeson's portrayal of Qui Gon Jinn made his character more likable than the others, but other actors such as Ewan Mcgregor and Ian Mcdirmad also helped out too. The cgi is good for the time and doesn't look too bad even today. Overall this movie was intended for kids (and the acting may suffer because of it), but anyone with knowledge of Star Wars could find something to like in this movie.8/10",8,2,3,8 May 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," This movie puts the War in Star Wars
","This movies plot could have just been explained by a novel, but i'm glad it wasn't. This is by far the best of the Disney Star Wars movies and it shows. But there are a couple problems, the first being the lack of Darth Vader. Vader's presence in the film is too short lived. Even though everyone knows who Vader is, it still would have been nice to see more of the Sith Lord. My second problem is Diego Luna as Cassian Andor. For most of the movie he just seems like a stock character with nothing really interesting about him. Otherwise this movie is pretty good. The return of Saw Gerrara was a welcome one, but the real star of this movie was Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic. He is without a doubt the best Disney villain and one of my favorite Star Wars villains. Jyn Erso, K2-S0, Chirutt, and Baze were all good characters, and all of their death were handled well. The action in this movie is some of the best in the franchise, and the final battle was great. Overall, this movie is full of action and (mostly) good performances which makes it without a doubt the best of the Disney Star Wars movies.",8,1,1,13 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The good far outweighs the bad
","This is considered by many to be the worst Star Wars movie, but it deserves more credit. Yes, the cringey romance weighs it down but for the most part George Lucas knew what he was doing when he made the story. Unlike the OT, the prequels have a lot more political intrigue. Because of this, politics play a larger role in the characters lives and duties. Anakin for example, despite being a Jedi, is controlled by the self righteous Jedi Council who despite being fully aware of the corruption in the Senate, acts as if nothing is happening, and thus stops caring about the common good. Despite the memes that have come from it, the romance between Anakin and Padme is cliched and dull. Despite how much of the movie this plot line takes up, it also shows the Anakin's rage towards his mothers death and his subsequent fall towards the dark side. The politics of this movie are put to better use as it makes the plot more interesting. The action scenes are well done and scattered throughout the movie to make it more interesting. The acting has improved with this movie, with Jar Jar getting little screen time, and with mediocre actors improving. The addition of the Separatists and Jango Fett was a welcome one and the Kamino arc also improves the story as well. Overall despite the cringey romance, this movie allows itself to be more serious than it's predecessor and have better action and a better story.8.5/10",8,2,2,8 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," If Empire Strikes Back didn't exist this would be my favorite Star Wars movie
","This was my favorite Star Wars movie growing up, and it is one of my all time favorite movies. For me this is the best non happy ending movie ever. This movie would be a 10/10 but because of some sloppily delivered dialogue, it is not. Otherwise this movie is great. The first two prequels may not have been perfect, but what many choose to ignore is the fact that they were setting the stage for this movie. I have always loved the fact that the prequels present the Jedi how they should be presented. They aren't perfect beings and instead they are presented as naive, arrogant, self righteous, bigots who try to bend everything to their will and in the process, indirectly and ironically cause their own destruction. The way that Anakin is turned to the dark side is well presented and not burdened down by the heavy handed dialogue of the first two films. The action is perhaps the best in the series with Order 66 and the lightsaber duels are well directed as well. My favorite scene in this movie is when Palpatine tells Anakin about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise. This scene cements Anakin's curiosity about the dark side, and also gives Palpatine a foothold in Anakin's mind a the kind of teacher that would teach him anything about the force. Needless to say this is the best of the prequel trilogy and my 2nd favorite SW movie. Overall this movie is iconic to me and i always will appreciate what George Lucas did by ending the prequels this way.9.5/10",10,1,1,8 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," This is a good movie, if you like utter garbage
","Like many people, seeing this movie for the first time, i thought it was great. However upon a re-watch a month later, i had a moment of clarity. Besides the obvious fact this movie literally a spruced up version of A New Hope, this movie fails at nearly everything it presents to it's audience. First off i will say that the return of Harrison Ford was a welcome one, and the cinematography was good. Otherwise, this movie is awful. Rey is a Mary Sue, enough said. Luke and Han ran away from everything they held dear and become shells of the great characters that they used to be. Finn and Poe are incredibly mediocre to the point of being useless. Kylo Ren is a whiny crybaby that gets bested by a girl with no lightsaber training at all. General Hux and the First Order are not threatening at all, and neither is the Death Star 3, and Snoke was just there for fan theories and nothing else. Overall, if you want to watch a good Star Wars movie, let alone a movie with an original plot and good characters, don't watch this and watch the prequel and original trilogies, anything but this.2/10",2,2,2,22 May 2020
