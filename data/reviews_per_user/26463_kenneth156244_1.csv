Mission: Impossible III," In your face John Woo! This is the way to follow up Mission Impossible!
","Since Mission Impossible II was so hideous, my expectations for this third part were not exactly high. However, I couldn't resist seeing it on the opening day and thank *** for that! M:I:III is a rock hard,action packed spy movie in the style of the first part. Some serious fights, loads of funky equipment, a few jokes and extremely cool operations. Too bad though, that the plot is quite far from original (and very predictable) so I guess the first Mission Impossible still rules.For some reason this comment is too short so what you're reading now is only blabla to make sure that it gets posted. Makes me wonder why though... What's wrong with short comments? OK finished.",8,1,4,4 May 2006
