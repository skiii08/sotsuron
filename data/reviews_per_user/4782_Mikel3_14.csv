3:10 to Yuma," See the 1957 Glenn Ford classic instead of this over produced disaster
","*** Major spoilers included *** Yes, this one has more explosions and graphic violence than the original, but that does not make it a good film. As at least one other comment here pointed out, the story is totally illogical. We are supposed to accept that a previously cold-hearted killer grows to like the good guy family man yada, yada, yada trying to bring him to justice. So what if a hangman's rope is waiting, he wants to make Dan his pal. We even get little anvil on the head hints at what's to come later. Like Dan's son saying the killer has some good in him. He can see it's there. They even make Ben's victims, after Ben meets Dan, out to be jerks right before he kills them. To justify their deaths we assume-'Hey, he insulted his mom and did bad things in his past, he deserved to die'. Or 'He had to stab him countless times in the throat with a fork till he was dead...he was a total jerk and even burned Dan's barn down'... The final illogical straw was having notorious Ben Wade kill all his own gang members that risked their miserable lives to free him? Why because he developed some kind of guy crush on a farmer. Just plain stupid, done obviously for the shock value to the viewer. Even the sex scene between Russell Crowe's character Ben and a girl he seduces seemed contrived and pointless. Like it was stuck in the film to show his character wasn't gay. Otherwise we might later think he had a crush on Christian Bale's Dan and that's why he was attracted to him and wanted to get on that train. Of course then they would have to change the film's name to '3:10 to Brokeback Mountain'.These are just a few examples from the avalanche of illogical moments in this film. Yes, the actors were all good and no expense was spared for explosions and running horses. To bad they didn't have a well written story to do the actors and horseys justice. For those western fans that haven't seen the original 1957 film this was based on, see it. That movie is immeasurably better. Beats me why this turkey remake is rated so highly here.",Null,10,15,24 July 2008
Skyfall," The best Bond in years even with it's flaws
","We saw Skyfall on DVD Saturday night. I have some issues with the story, still it was the best Bond film I've seen in ages. It confirmed for me that Daniel Craig is the best actor to play Mr. Bond since my favorite, Sean Connery. The film was loaded with action like most Bond films. It also contained some interesting back stories on Bond's roots and that for some of the other characters. If it had ended better I would have liked it even more.Warning - stop now if you have not seen the film. Spoilers are coming.I didn't like how the white slave girl was killed during the target pistol challenge to Bond. Bond makes his move to fight right after she's shot instead of before in order to save her. It should have been written differently. He had more or less given her hope he would save her on the boat. The Bonds of the past films would have done more for her. This Bond hardly seemed fazed by her impending death.The villain was played very well. You could even understand his hatred for M. Problem is that his escape from the cell and the way he played Bond's agency made them all look like total knuckleheads. Would it have hurt to put a good padlock on his cell in addition to electronic doors? They knew their systems had already been compromised once.I thought the way it ended with Judi Dench's M dying was a mistake too. I know they were going for the emotional impact. Maybe it was how she paid for the lives of the agents she'd sacrificed. She was even willing to write off Bond if it meant saving more agents. Now it was her turn. The problem for me was Bond had spent the last part of the film doing everything in his power to save her life. He even totally destroyed his ancestral home. And worst of all the classic Aston Martin from Goldfinger. It was so nice to see the car back, then they totally destroy it. It was so silly that M escaped onto the moors through a hidden passage only to then start walking with a bright flashlight. In the dark that flashlight showed exactly where she was to her pursuers. She might as well have sent up a flare ! Then she hides in the only other building left standing. If they had simply hidden on the moors in the dark with the flashlight out they never would have been found. Also, there should have been an army there to help protect her after the attack. Instead she has only Bond. If they were using this as a way to show that Bond still had what it takes to be the best, they should not have made all his efforts to save her be in vain. The ending I would have preferred was her retiring. Maybe even hinting that she was going to have some sort of relationship with that grounds keeper and retire to a simple life for her final years.",Null,1,6,4 March 2013
The Babadook," A drastically over-rated film and definitely NOT for animal lovers (spoilers)
","(warning: spoilers) The movie had potential with the weird pop-up book idea and the strange kid, then went downhill steadily. It finally just became a pretty typical possession/haunted house movie with cheap thrills, shadows in the night and voices in the dark, is she going insane or is it real... and the payoff is a ridiculous ending. The police of course never believe the victims when then go for help. Also, the scene with the cute family dog being cruelly killed was totally unnecessary. Why is it so often when you see a pet dog or cat in one of these films they end up dead? It's so predictable and over done just to get a grim response from the viewer. Yeah, I admit it bothers me more seeing an animal get murdered than a human. Perhaps cause they're often more loving and often defenseless. I suspect I'm not alone in feeling that way. I wasted time on this over-rated piece of junk. Just goes to show you can't always trust the IMDb ratings. The ending was totally silly, mother and son both need some serious therapy staying there and keeping it as some sort of pet. I know many of you will disagree...still that's the way I feel. I'm hoping to warn others who might feel the same.",Null,5,12,24 October 2015
Orphan," Fun at times, predictable from start to finish
","Overall, this movie was okay and did hold our interest for the most part.The plot was however very predictable with the usual dumb moves on the part of the hapless victims. I kept saying to myself 'Yeah, buddy, don't listen to the women you've been married to for ten plus years and had children with. Take the side of the obviously weird kid who just came into your lives'. And don't say to yourself 'Gee, I wonder why our new little girl goes nuts when someone wants to touch her neck ribbon or mentions going to the dentist ?'. There were so many illogical story devices used in this film. But, if you like stories about dumb adults and killers who take advantage of their total stupidity this should please you. IMHO, 'The Good Son' was a much better example of this type of film.'Orphan' was at least watchable and did have it's moments now and then. Sadly, I was hoping for something much better based on the comments I'd seen here. The film is way over-rated. There is nothing new in it.",Null,2,3,10 January 2010
Pacific Rim," All action buddy film and not much else
","We watched this one on DVD last night. It was okay, the giant robot and monster effects were good. Personally I prefer the giant 1940s style retro looking robots from 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'. 'Pacific Rim' had a bit too much action and fighting,not enough story for my taste. I suppose it made for a good buddy movie like watching Maverick and Iceman competing in 'Top Gun'. You know how it will eventually turn out between them. I'm sure giant monster fans, of the Godzilla variety would like it, that was never my favorite type of film. I found myself getting a bit bored with the silly giant sword bits and all. I imagined Japanese viewers might love that part. Sort of a giant robot samurai or whatever, to me it was childish like a Saturday morning cartoon for kids. It also reminded me of the Transformers films. IMO the first one 'Transformers' (2007)was better than this if you like giant robots and their weaponry.",Null,0,2,21 May 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," If you liked 'Van Helsing' you'll probably enjoy this too
","Mini-Review: Last night we watched 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'. I found it to be a fun movie for the most part. It reminded me very much of the '2004' film 'Van Helsing'. If you liked that, you might like this also. They had the same sort of fantastic weapons as Van Helsing did, seemingly impossible for the time periods depicted. There were more witches in this movie than you can shake a broomstick at . Most were appropriately scary or weird looking. The acting was good and there was plenty of action. There was some gore, not too excessive, enough to earn its R-rating I suppose. Occasionally the language seemed a bit out of place, just like the weapons were, for the time. For instance when under-stress our two heroes liked to use the F word. No big deal, just that it somehow seemed out of place, and too contemporary for the surrounding mood. The ending left the door open for a sequel or two if it was a success at the box-office. I did like the friendship that developed between Gretel and an unlikely character in the story. There was also a love story with Hansel. Both side stories added some 'charm'. I don't want to say more and reveal too much.",Null,6,8,15 January 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Funniest horror film in ages
",I just finished watching 'Tucker and Dale Vs Evil'. The film was recommended by a friend. It was one of the funniest films I've seen in a while. It's right up there with 'Wasting Away' and other good recent horror comedies. In fact it would make a fun double feature with. In brief Tucker and Dale is the story of two nice guy Hillbillies that are mistakenly thought to be psycho killers by some college kids. Hey with all the movies on that subject who could blame them. Through a series of freak accidents they start to look more and more guilty. I very much enjoyed the film. It even has a cute love story in it...a bit hard to believe but cute non the less. I hope we see Tucker and Dale again in another flick soon ! Oh and Dale's dog too.,Null,1,1,29 September 2012
The Mist," A mean-spirited over-rated film
","***** Warning: Spoilers ****** Once again King's talents are used to create a dreary story where just about every character you care about is dead by the end or in misery. And he usually finds an excuse to take a shot at religion, showing the religious to be crazy hypocritical fanatics almost as bad as the main threat. The story was illogical and the characters were unrealistic in their actions. The ending was extremely mean-spirited, again illogical and unnecessary except for cheap shock value. In todays jaded world of film viewers I'm not surprised this movie is acclaimed for it's violence and shock value. I have to laugh at those who call it a modern day classic horror film. Obviously they do not recognize what makes a film a classic.I'm sure this will be an unpopular comment, still I'm glad to have expressed my feelings on this poorly conceived piece of garbage.",Null,5,12,3 June 2008
Clash of the Titans," Clash of the Titans vs the 1981 Version
","We finally saw the 2010 remake of 'Clash of the Titans'. Overall I liked it better than the original. The original was always a bit to cutesy for me with that mechanical owl and all. BTW, he did do a short cameo in the remake. The effects on the climactic scene with the Kraken were more realistic in the new version, but lacked the charm of the Ray Harryhausen creation for me. I preferred the 1981 Kraken design. The remake's Kraken looked like a giant creature from 'Aliens' more than a creature from Greek mythology IMO.I did like Sam Worthington's Perseus better than Harry Hamlin's. But Hamlin's looked more like my idea of a Greek hero. For instance the new Perseus' hair was too short and he seemed more like a Roman Gladiator. The English accents didn't help. Yeah, I know, who's to say an American accent is better for the parts. For me it took away from the film. But, I still preferred the new Perseus anyway. He seemed tougher and less boyish.I also preferred Liam Neeson's Zeus to Laurence Olivier's interpretation. For me Olivier's was too over the top and Shakespearean. Like he thought he was on stage again. I felt like Olivier was given free reign with the role and nobody dared direct him otherwise. He also seemed too feeble for the all powerful king of the Gods. Liam played the part nicely and had the presence. But even so I have a hard time deciding whose delivery of the famous line 'RELEASE The KRAKEN !!!' was better. They were both fun to hear in different ways.The Gorgon in the 2010 version was better. Giving her a pretty face with snake hair was a good idea. The movie story says she was once a great beauty. Her appearance gave a hint of what she once was.I also liked the twist on the ending and who the woman would be that Perseus loved and would find happiness with.BTW-I'm happy to see there is a 'Clash of the Titans 2' in post production with most of the cast returning. I do wonder why Gemma Arterton as Io is not listed. Especially the way the first one ended.",Null,0,1,16 August 2011
From Hell," One of the best films on this case I've ever seen -Warning:Major Spoilers
","Last night I watched 'From Hell' for the first time. IMO it is among the best of the 'Jack the Ripper' tales I've seen. In fact it may very well be the best. The only other one I can think of that came close is 'Murder by Decree'. From what I've read in the past on the actual Ripper case, i suspect it probably did involve English Nobility and cover ups in some way.The film was wonderfully atmospheric. It reminded me of the recent 'The Wolfman' film in that regard. I really felt I was back in time walking the foggy streets of the Whitechapel slums. And I felt for the poor people living there trying to get money to survive any way they could. A sharp contrast to the rich and privileged who viewed them as worthless expendables. The lives of a few prostitutes were nothing compared to protecting even one noble or the crown. Just fiction here, but IMO historically true in that regard.Johnny Depp did his usual fine acting job here. His inspector reminded me of Sherlock Holmes, even down to the drug use. His sergeant side kick was not unlike Dr. Watson. The story was imaginative and chilling, it was plausible and might actually be close to the truth. I felt bad for those poor women killed just because they had the misfortune to witness a friends wedding. A wedding and a child that were unacceptable to the crown.To be honest I was not surprised at who turned out to be 'The Ripper', it was obviously meant to be a shock, for me it was not. The signs were all there. Ian Holm's was chilling in the role. I'm pretty sure in the scenes where he was in the heat of mad killing his eye pupils seemed a dark gleaming black, demonic in their appearance. In his calmer scenes they did not look this way and were blue or some other normal eye color.The primitive lobotomy scenes were also unnerving. I noticed that as the judges gavel rang out three times it coincided with the three 'taps' on the skull used to lobotomize Jack's brain in the next scene. Just like they had done to the unfortunate prostitute who had bore the princess' child. Queen Victoria herself was also depicted as cruel, when Mary went to the museum with Inspector Abberline she saw a portrait of the queen and commented on the coldness of her eyes. Turns out she was right. I know little about Queen Victory, so this may be unfair to her memory, I don't know. For some reason I keep thinking about the recent royal conspiracy theories associated with the death of princess Diana. I wondered just what the so called 'Royals' might be capable of in the name of protecting the image of the monarchy. I'm not saying I believe those theories about Princess Di, just that it made me wonder 'what if' after watching this film.Thoughts about 'From Hell' will stick with me for quite a while. I wish my wife had watched it too so we could have one of our usual discussions after seeing a thought provoking film I keep going over scenes in it. I particularly liked the ending, the twist that the real Mary Kelly was not killed but lived on in the little seaside cottage she wanted to return to. Sadly the french prostitute was mistakenly killed in her stead. The inspectors reasoning for why he could never join Mary made cold hard sense. Unfortunately I knew in advance the Inspector was going to die from a comment I had accidentally read in a discussion group. At first I thought his was an accidentally death. Now I believe he killed himself...why else would he have the coins in his hand ready to pay the ferry man. He probably was so disillusioned with life, what he had learned, and not being able to join Mary that he decided to end his pain. His job was finished Jack was finished.My wife didn't watch it with me. She was concerned it would be too gory. Turns out that, considering the subject matter, it really was not that bloody. There were a few scenes that were overly graphic, like of a throat being cut, but over all we mostly just heard a chilling slashing blade sound. The Masons tie in was a nice touch too. Though I don't think their society was depicted fairly. Still, you never know.I look forward now to watching the bonus disk that came with the DVDs. I understand it has material about the actual case.",Null,0,1,14 June 2011
Jersey Boys," Great songs, lacking charisma from the leads
","I watched this movie last night, I've wanted to see the Broadway show for sometime now. HBO was free for a few days and this was one of their offerings.Overall the film was just okay, I enjoyed it mostly for the great songs and the fact I'm from New Jersey too. I'm not really sure how true to life the story was. There were at least some things I know were factual, like the untimely death of Mr. Vali's daughter. I did not find John Lloyd Young's performance playing Frankie Valli to be that good even if he did win a Tony for performing onstage. Good stage actors are not always good film actors and vise versa. He simply has no charisma in my opinion. Also, some scenes were not that well presented . For instance the makeup used near the end of the film to make Mr. Young and the others look older was almost laughably bad. The supporting cast, the guys playing the other members of the group, were decent to good. Some of them were also from the Broadway show. Christopher Walken is also featured. I've found Mr. Walken's performances in recent to be lackluster, like he's phoning it in. Here he was acceptable playing a sentimental mobster who helped the group's career. I suspect the movie depicted Frankie Valli as a better person than he may really is. I guess that's to be expected from these bio stories. If you like the music of the 'Four Seasons' then you'll probably be able to tolerate this film too. Clint Eastwood has proven himself to be a fine director in the past, I don't think he did a good job with this film, perhaps he should stay away from interpreting successful Broadway musicals for the cinema. If he was trying to give it the look and feel of a Broadway show instead of a movie, he failed.I give this film 5 out of 10 stars, that's being generous mainly because I enjoyed the musical performances and I'm a proud Jersey boy myself.",Null,0,0,10 July 2018
There Will Be Blood," Fine acting does not a great film make...
",If a big name talented actor or two are in a film and enough money is spent on hype a movie can be made to appear better than it actually is. Especially if it contains scenes ambiguous enough for imaginative people to make up their own story to fill in the plot holes. The lack of a clear straight forward plot will leave many viewers impressed by how 'deep' and chuck full of hidden meaning the film was. They'll decide people who don't rave about the masterpiece simply don't understand it and are obviously of a lesser intellect.Many a mediocre film has been elevated to critical acclaim based on similar formulas.In short this was a movie that contained fine acting and little else IMO.,Null,4,6,22 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Some Intriguing new characters for the series otherwise disappointing
","*************Warning extreme plot spoilers do not read further if you have not yet seen the film.***************** We watched this last night. I thought it was okay, not great. It did not have the impact a few of the other films had on me. I do like the new characters that were introduced. It was also great to see some of our old friends from the original series back again.Some of what I did not particularly care for: There was too much rehashing of plot devices. For instance, a droid with info that leads to something the rebels and the Empire want. The supposedly last Jedi is in hiding (Obi-Wan Kenobi/Luke Skywalker). The force is again very strong in someone young and abandoned who needs to be trained. The main villain on the dark side of the force is related to some of the rebel heroes. Darth Vader was Luke's Father. Here it's Luke's nephew and Leia's son. Yet another death star type weapon rather easily destroyed by a few shots and explosions in just the right place. Yes, it was much bigger than the original death star, yet it seemed even easier to destroy. I was also VERY disappointed that Han and Leia had been separated for what was implied to be a long time. I had liked the way their story had ended in 'Return of the Jedi'. I felt this ruined their love story. Yes, they had a son, evidently they did a poor job raising and guiding him. Did they learn nothing from what happened to Leia's father about the dangers of the dark side? And where was uncle Jedi Luke during his formative years? (wink) Kylo Ren may be the least menacing of all the Star Wars villains and it's hard to believe who his parents are supposed to be looks wise.I was also not keen on them making it out like Luke's light saber was some sort of holy Grail. Also the big lead-up to about 30 seconds of Luke in a hooded robe was silly to me. Yes, I'm sure all that lead- up to finally see Luke appealed to many other old fans. My biggest issue with the story was killing off my second favorite character in the series Han Solo. BTW- my favorite was Obi-Wan Kenobi as played to perfection by Ewan McGregor and before him by Alec Guinness. Harrison Ford did what I thought was a remarkable job bringing the character he originated back to life again after all these years. He used the same facial expressions and all unique to Han. Yes, he was notably older as we all are, yet he still made an excellent action hero. I was VERY disappointed they chose to kill him off. And afterward there was not much time devoted to mourning for him. I expected a Darth Vader Viking Funeral-like solemn send off...even without a body to honor. Instead after a few bowed heads and hugs they all seemed to move on rather quickly, even Chewbacca. I have not been this disappointed in the loss of a favorite fictional film character since Captain Kirk. And Han, after all he had gone through should not have died at the hand of his own son. As for Carrie Fisher, she seemed to be sleep walking through her part not at all bringing back Princess Leia Organa. In her case all the magic and strength of her character was gone. She looked fine, just no spark anymore. Perhaps she has health problems or simply is not a very good actress any more.Overall this was a decent film. It was fun to see most of the original cast back again. The new cast members are very intriguing and show much promise. I especially like Daisy Ridley and it's nice to see that she does not need anyone to rescue her. She handles herself fine. I also very much like the character Poe Dameron he has a nice way about him as a hero. Also, Finn has a lot of potential and seems good-hearted. I just thought the attraction between him and Rey was a bit too much, like Han and Leia or Luke and Leia (at first). I would have preferred the stories of the original cast had ended with 'Return of the Jedi'. It was a nice neat happy ending. This movie ruined that for me, yet introduced intriguing new characters.",Null,7,11,12 May 2016
The Cabin in the Woods," A refreshingly different take on a tired horror film formula
","Warning: Major Plot spoilers * * * * * * Last night we watched 'The Cabin in the Woods'. From the title and brief description I read, I was expecting the usual type horror story. The kind with partying college or high school kids isolated from the rest of civilization doing stupid things and a monster killing them off one by one. Just like in so many other films before. Instead this one had an interesting twist to it. The party bound college kids in this film were actually being set up by some sort of secret organization that periodically sacrificed young people to various type of horrors zombies, ghosts, werewolves, giant bats and so in. The human sacrifices were needed in order to keep some giant Lovecraftian type creatures from taking over the world. It's similar to the way virgins had once been sacrificed in ancient cultures to appease their gods like being thrown into a volcano or stabbed on an altar. Now the young were being sacrificed in a different way and certain types were needed like a studious one, a virgin, an athlete, a buffoon, a promiscuous girl and so on. Also they were being watched by TV cameras without their knowledge. They were even drugged in order to affect their actions and ways were set up to prevent their escape. A few of the assigned victims decided not to give in so easily to the zombies killers sent to destroy them. Instead they turn the tables on the organization that is using them as sacrifices. The organization itself was an interesting setup. They almost seemed like any other group of white collar corporate co-workers, even taking bets on what type of horror the victims would inadvertently pick to destroy themselves. The way others might bet on the outcome of a weekly pro football game. When it looked like all was going as planned they seemed to be having a typical office type party to celebrate another success. They cared little for the lives of the people they had set up. They viewed it as something necessary for the survival of humanity and were used to it. This added side plot to the movie made all the difference to me, making it refreshingly different instead of the usual formula.As many of you know, I don't care for gore fests or that kind of film. I did like this movie and the sort that take you off guard, it was not overly gory and was different for a change. It also had an appropriate final scene.",Null,0,1,10 October 2013
