The Blair Witch Project," Well written
","The scariest movie I have ever seen. The movie was so intense that I found it hard to watch, don't get me wrong it was truly innovative and well written. After the climax, I was short of breath. The way the film was shot makes you feel like you are one of characters. The movie has an amazing effect of 'suspension of disbelief', you start to feel the hysteria that the actors are portraying.",Null,1,1,18 July 1999
