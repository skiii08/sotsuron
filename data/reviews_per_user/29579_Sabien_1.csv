The Blair Witch Project," Marketing and Originality were outstanding, Overall what a bore!
","I must say that the hype behind this movie was a result of marketing genius. Using the internet the way that they did was brilliant, and the way they got all the papers to buy into it was even better. The story was original enough, but overall this movie stunk! Those of you that find it terrifying or what not must have really weak minds and find really simple junk frightening.This movie had a great premise to be really frightening, but the cinematography was just too amateur to build any sense of fear. Perhaps had the marketers been able to keep a sense that this was reality than it would have kept the fear up a little more, but the papers and mags spoiled that and this movie stunk! There was nothing scary about this movie, the only thing scary about it is that I along with millions of others fell victim to the hype, and received one giant let down. This is by far the worst movie I have seen all year!Two thumbs way DOWN!",1,1,3,2 August 1999
