Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," now....lets hold on for a minute
","I remember when the announcement of the prequel came out. I didn't need it to change my life by giving me insight on the characters to such a degree that they make the older movies seem lame. I was just excited about some more Star Wars movies. The marketing explosion was soon to follow.Suddenly, there were gobs of SW toys filling the shelf again. Some were representative of the new films, some of the old. Just as we are being beaten about the head with the ominous release of Episode VII in December. I picture some of the people I went to high school with going out to their garages to try and track down the old VHS tapes of the old movies, so that they may sequentially be shoved down their children's throats. I admit I'm equally as excited. About the same time...well actually several months before Episode I's release, McDonald's started theming every thing with SW imagery.OK...I'm not going to be specific here, because I know I don't have to. The worst, and I mean worst thing about this movie was the boy's mom. I got the feeling that if she could have carried out the dialog in Spanish, she would have been at least a fraction more believable. The character never missed an opportunity to display a weak protest every time the boy has heading full-throttle into danger, just to give in almost instantly. I wish I knew who to blame for this. There's another character named Darth Maul, which was to me more interesting than any of the others. As a result, he was spirited out of the story as quickly as he appeared. As I'm typing this, I'm reminded of an image that was floating around prior to the release of the film. The image was of Anakin Skywalker as a young boy casting a shadow in the desert sand of Darth Vader. So that was coolSo here we are many years later. Eagerly anticipating the new movie, nerds like me are watching the old movies. After watching this film, I'm reminded of the fact that movies are not meant to do much more than entertain us. There's a lot more to say, but I'll leave it here for now. Over all, I do not believe this movie to be the stinker others do, but it does carry as it's burden, a number of inexcusable flaws.",6,0,3,28 October 2015
