Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Unrealistically Believable!
","A name and idea so bizarre that actually works? I thought that would be unreal but this movie proved that wrong. Never before have I seen such a creative idea be attached to a huge part of American History and actually make sense. While I did have high anticipation for this film, I was still very surprise and impressed by the outcome.This film stars Benjamin Walker (Flags of Our Fathers, Kinsey), Dominic Cooper (Captain America: The First Avenger, The Devil's Double), Anthony Mackie (The Hurt Locker, Real Steel), and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, The Thing).The story starts you with a young Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) dealing with the death of his mother due to a Vampire. A few years later after his father passes away, he decides to go after the Vampire that killed his mother. While doing this he runs into Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper), a real vampire hunter who recruits Abraham Lincoln and trains him to become a real vampire hunter as well. From then on you see young Abraham Lincoln grow as a person with him becoming a great vampire hunter, a politician, and a love life. This is as far as I want to go with the story but from there Abraham Lincoln deal with becoming the 16th President of the United States, deal with the Civil War, and hunt vampires.The 3D was actually pretty good at some of the heavy action scenes which was awesome, but for the slower parts of the film is was just added depth. I recommend seeing it in 3D for some of the really fun action scenes, but if you are not into the whole 3D craze, then the standard 2D should be just as good.I really did enjoy this movie for how realistic they made the story seemed. They tied in this fictional story of vampires with the real life story of Abraham Lincoln so well that it seems like this movie could have been real. Another to note is how good the action looked. The were so many decapitated heads as well as hard hitting chops and slices into the vampires. Every hit that was delivered will make you cringe and believe they were real. The movie is something that you should go into with an open mind and you would think that you wouldn't take a movie like this seriously, but the movie is so dead serious with everything that happens that it is so believable. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes well done stories and intense gory fun action.Rating: 7/10Thank you for reading my review, any feedback is greatly appreciated!",7,5,10,23 June 2012
42," Knocked out of the ball park!
","To start off, I am not the biggest fan of any type of sport, but I do enjoy the occasional sports movie. I thought it was very well done and kept you entertained the entire time. The facts were all right with every other player on the Dodgers and showed the realism of how racism used to be. I highly recommend seeing this movie not only if yo are a Baseball fan, but if you want to see a truly well done film. One thing that really surprised me was how awesome of a job that Harrison Ford did playing Branch Rickey who owned the Dodgers. Chadwick Boseman also did a very great job playing Jackie Robinson. He kept the same attitude and gestures which was very entertaining to watch. For my full video Review: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxk-ZFZFUMQ",8,5,5,15 April 2013
Ted," Live action Family Guy!
","This is the closest thing you are going to get to a real life Family Guy. Seth MacFarlane, the creator of shows like Family Guy, American Dad, and The Cleveland Show, writes and directs one of the funniest movies I have seen in a very long time. I am so glad that this movie did not disappoint me because it was one of my most hyped films for 2012.This movie stars Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), Mila Kunis (That's 70 Show, Black Swan), Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy, American Dad), Joel McHale (The Soup, Community), and Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Saving Private Ryan).When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) receives a Teddy Bear (Seth MacFarlane) for Christmas when he was little, he makes a wish for it to come to life. So of course, it does come to life. They grow up through the years together as best friends and still are smoking weed, getting drunk, and going no where in life. John has been in a 4 year relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis) and Ted keeps getting John to do stupid things that cause Lori and him to fight. Lori has had it with Ted and tells John it is her or the Bear.I thought the movie was very well written and very funny. Seth MacFarlane always loves to push his jokes out further and as a result it adds to making the movie non stop funny from start to finish. The Ted character that Seth MacFarlane has created is so great, that I believe Ted can turn into a franchise. I highly recommend seeing this film as soon as possible.Rating: 8/10Thank you for reading my review, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",8,2,7,3 July 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spidey is back and better than ever!
","I was a big fan of the original 2 Spider-Man movies, just not a big fan of the 3rd film. I am glad that someone picked up Spider-Man again and told a different origin story. My hype for this film was through the roof ever since the first trailer premiered in front of Captain America Movie last year. The ultimate thing that people want to know is if this film was better than the original trilogy. Lets just say yes to that.This film stars Andrew Garfield (The Social Network, Never Let Me Go), Emma Stone (The Help, Superbad), Rhys Ifans (Little Nicky, Anonymous), Denis Leary (Rescue Me, Ice Age), and Martin Sheen (The West Wing, The Departed).The 3D in the film was a mixed bag of good and great. When the action scenes were not going on, the 3D was decent with the depth, but there was nothing really popping out of the screen. Now, when there is action, the 3D gets enhanced and it pushes really far out of the screen. The 3D and IMAX 3D showings of the film are you best bet to get the best experience out of the film.When Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is young, his mother and father drop leave him in the care of his aunt and uncle. Once he is older and in high school, he finds some of his dads old stuff and starts to snoop and get into it. He finds his dads old work partner and helps him finish his project to regenerate skins cells and regrow limbs and such. At the same time he is falling for Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who's dad is the police Captain. While dealing with the cops and the results of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) project, Spider-Man has a lot to deal with. I thought this film was spectacular. I enjoyed every action scene, story based scene, and romantic scenes. There was only one real main problem and that was the pacing of the film. It felt like they rushes the begging story line scenes just to get him to be in the Spider-Man suit as soon as possible. Other than that the film was really well done and well directed. I don't think this film will do as well as 'The Avengers' did or 'The Dark Night Rises' will, but I think it is a great super hero film. I can't recommend this film enough. If you are a fan of Spider-Man, than this film does justice to the Spider-Man franchise.Rating: 8.5/10Thank you for reading my review, any feedback is greatly appreciated!",8,1,4,3 July 2012
Brave," Better than expected!
","Honestly I wasn't looking forward to this Disney film at first because it really didn't interest me at all. I thought that Disney Princess movies have ran their course, but after watching the film I found out I was wrong. Disney just never seems to disappoint me, even if I didn't have the slightest interest. I only went to go see this film because my friends were like 'Hey let's go see a movie.' Since I have seen the other movie that are already in theaters, we all decided to see Brave at the last second. The film stars Kelly Macdonald (No Country for Old Men, Trainspotting), Billy Connolly (The Last Samurai, The Boondock Saints), and Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, In the Name of the Father). The 3D in this film was not as good as I thought it would be for a Disney film. Most animated movies I see have great 3D and sadly this one didn't impress me at all. The film starts of as your average Disney movie does and you meet your princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) right away. Now something I did like was that this takes place in Scotland so everyone has an awesome accents. Also something that was good is that the film was a lot darker than other Disney films. After trying to be forced to get set up with a suitor to marry her, she runs away from her problems and finds a way to change her fate around. At this point in the film is where the film takes a different and surprising turn where if you don't like it, then you won't like the rest of the movie. I happen to like where it went and enjoyed the whole film.It is definitely not the best Disney movie ever made, but it is a pretty decent film. Truthfully I was expecting to be disappointed from the film and I am glad to say that was very impressed. Especially at the animation, Merida's hair looks so real in the way it moves and looks. Little kids will eat this movie up as well as adults will enjoy the film. Rating: 7/10Thank you for reading my review, any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",7,3,5,28 June 2012
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Not as good as the others!
","The fourth installment in a film series usually end up being mediocre or just plain out bad films. Sadly this film falls into the mediocre category and ends up being the worst film in the series, but that doesn't mean it is a terrible film, it just wasn't the best. The 3D in this film was probably the best part of the film. The 3D really came out of the screen as well as the film had great depth. The 3D version is for sure the superior version to see. This film stars Ray Romano (Everybody Loves Raymond, Ice Age), Dennis Leary (Rescue Me, The Amazing Spider-Man), John Leguizamo (The Lincoln Lawyer, Ice Age), Aziz Ansari (Parks and Recreation, 30 Minutes or Less), Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones, Elf), Aubrey 'Drake' Graham (Charlie Bartlett, Degrassi: The Next Generation), Queen Latifah (The Dilemma, Just Wright), Jennifer Lopez (What to Expect When You're Expecting, The Back-up Plan), Nicki Minaj (Ice Age: Continental Drift), Keke Palmer (True Jackson, VP, Akeelah and the Bee), Josh Peck (Drake & Josh, The Wackness), Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Paul), Seann William Scott (Road Trip, Role Models), Patrick Stewart (X-men, American Dad), and Wanda Sykes (Rio, Over the Hedge).Manny (Ray Romano), Diego (Dennis Leary), and Sid (John Leguizamo) get drifted into the sea due to the forming of all the continents on Earth. While they are separated from the heard, they run into some pirates who try to take them as prisoners. There main goal is to make it back home to help their friends and loved ones while trying to escape from the pirates. I enjoyed the film but it wasn't anything special. This is the worst out of the four films but its not a crappy movie, it just wasn't as funny nor did it feel that it needed to be made to add to the Ice Age story. Kids will probably have a fun time with this film but other than that its was just an alright film. Rating: 6/10Thank you for reading, any feedback is greatly appreciated!",6,0,1,19 July 2012
Prometheus," Simply put, amazing!
","The long awaited movie 'Prometheus', directed by Ridley Scott, has finally hit theaters and I couldn't be happier. This is a film that I have been waiting for sense it was announced and to see it finally done and ready for the eyes of the public just fills me up with so much joy. I love Ridley Scott's 'Alien' and thought it was such a well done and beautifully directed movie. Did 'Prometheus' capture that same Ridley Scott feel? Why yes, yes it did.Let me start off by saying this is not, in terms, a prequel to the original 'Alien' film from 1979, its more of an origin story taking place within the same 'Alien' universe. I can laterally sit and talk for hours about how I can connect 'Prometheus' and 'Alien' together. I have thoughts and theories of how the story, characters, evolution, and more can connect and make sense, but I will not go into that because I don't want to bore you for hours on end.The story in 'Prometheus' is that a group of explorers set out to find the origins of mankind which takes them to a far away galaxy to search the only planet (which is just a moon to a bigger planet) that can sustain live forms on it. While the explorers are there, they discover major secrets, and huge discoveries that may just be looking bad for the human race. Personally, I thought that the story was awesome and it brought a lot of back story or added story to the lore of the so called 'Alien' universe. I didn't find any weak points in the story, and I felt it was a tense, suspense, and flat out entertaining thrill ride.The movie stars Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon tattoo, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows), Logan Marshall-Green (Devil, Brooklyn's Finest), Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Bastards, X-Men: First Class), Charlize Theron (Hancock, Snow White and the Huntsman), Idris Elba (Thor, Takers), and Guy Pearce (Memento, The Hurt Locker). While all the performances given in the film were solid and believable, four stuck out the most.Fourth, Charlize Theron again just kills her role as a more evil/mean type character and just gives off a cold, but powerful, performance. Third, Idris Elba just knows how to deliver a believable, really human like, role by not feeling like he is forced to read lines, but make it sound like a normal, everyday, human conversation. Second, Noomi Rapace really showed me, in this film, that she can really act and be a really awesome lead role/heroine type character. First, Michael Fassbender delivers probably one of the best acting jobs I have seen in a very long time. He plays an android/robot character, built to look like a regular human, except he doesn't really show emotion, and he is exceptionally talented in almost anything. Seriously, Michael Fassbender deserves the award for best actor in every award show there is.I went to see the movie twice in IMAX 3D on the same day (opening day) if that says anything. The IMAX experience for this film is incredible, with the sound cranked all the way up and the picture quality looking to good to be true. Now the 3D was actually really well done. It didn't have to many things flying out of the screen (except for the storm scene), but the depth in this movie is so well done and looked so good compared to some other movies who just had lazily done depth just to make a movie in 3D and earn a few extra dollars. I recommend seeing the IMAX 3D version of 'Prometheus' in theaters.I really do love this film and I like all of the story elements that it adds to the 'Aliens' universe. Also, the use of practical and CGI effects blended so well together, that everything looked so real and I felt that the set was a real place and not just a staged/built set. If I could, I would go on and on about everything I liked about this film, but I don't want to spoil anything. In my opinion the movie is fantastic and its a must see.Rating: 10/10",10,15,32,9 June 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Best one yet!
","Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman and the rest of their gang return in the third installment of the 'Madagascar' series, and yes they are still trying to get back home to New York City. This film has them traveling with a group of circus animals all throughout Europe on the run from a French animal hunter who has killed every animal and has mounted their head on her wall, except for a lion.This movie stars the voice talents of Ben Stiller (Tower Heist, Tropic Thunder), Chris Rock (Grown ups, The Longest Yard), David Schwimmer (Friends, John Carter), Jada Pinkett Smith (Ali, Collateral), Sasha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno), Cedric the Entertainer (Larry Crowne, Ice Age), and Bryan Cranston (Drive, Breaking Bad). Everyone did a great job with their characters and it was a blast to hear all these familiar voices in a film together again.I have been a fan of the previous 'Madagascar' films, and that still is the case, but I really didn't have any hype for this movie because from the trailers, it didn't really look that good. I am glad to say that it is the complete opposite of that. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed film from start to finish and thought that for certain audiences, the film is perfect. If you are a younger person (12 and under) the movie will entertain and make you laugh the entire time. Now for the other demographic (13 and up), the film is still a really fun experience having jokes that adults would get, as well as some really funny situations.The 'Madagascar' series has been known to be over the top, but 'Madagascar 3″ takes the cake for being the most over the top one yet. You can not simply go into this movie expecting a toned down film featuring animals that can talk and doing anything that humans can. You have to go into this film with an open mind and just enjoy the ride. I found myself laughing constantly throughout the film and I couldn't help but have a smile on my face the entire time. This movie made me feel like I was a kid again and that is one of the best feelings there is.This is easily the best movie in the series in my opinion. What really blew me away though was something that wasn't crucial to the movie, and that was the 3D. This is probably some of the best 3D I have seen in a film. I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to pop out next. If you see this film, please do yourself a favor and see the 3D version of it, you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this film to all ages. Whether you are a kid or an adult, you will find enjoyment in this film.Rating 7.5/10",7,58,77,9 June 2012
