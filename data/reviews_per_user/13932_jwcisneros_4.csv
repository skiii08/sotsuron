Casablanca," Personal inspiration
","It has been debated in circles higher than I move in that Casablanca may well be one of the greatest films of all time. I only know that the film provided me with the inspiration to pursue my dream of being a professional actor. As many times as I seen this film, it still moves me.Casablanca is an example of what the art of film making is all about and IMHO should serve as a reminder of the love of craft that moves, inspires and entertains us with it's exhibition.",10,0,0,7 October 2000
L.A. Confidential," Great Cinema
","Probably the single finest film in year with an embarrassment of riches. It is asinine to think 'Titanic' beat this finely crafted, excellently scripted and intelligent film. AMPAS clearly missed the point and the took the cheap way out by denying this film 'Best Picture.'A tremendously talented cast leaves the audience actually wondering what the ending will be. Marvelous complexity.",10,3,7,5 March 2001
L.A. Confidential," More deserving
",This film is a far more deserving candidate to win an Oscar for Best Motion Picture than the James Cameron remake of the Titanic story. It proves how out of touch and shallow AMPAS is that Titanic (1997) won the Oscar over two better candidates. This film was an odd combination of hip and smart. Terrific acting performances at all levels of the film make LA Confidential one of the 5 best films ever made.,10,0,2,3 March 2003
Titanic," Not even the best of the 54
","This film was richly undeserving of the Best Picture Oscar in 1997. It wasn't the first film about Titanic to win an Oscar, nor the best. There are so many plot holes in this film that even an amateur cinematographer could critique it. The historical continuity was horrid. The only bright spots in the cast were Cate Blanchett and Bernard Fox. Leonardo DiCaprio had yet to grow into a degree of maturity as an actor and delivered a lackluster performance as Dawson.",5,2,3,19 June 2003
