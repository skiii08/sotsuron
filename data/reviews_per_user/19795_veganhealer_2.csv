Hereditary," ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS
",WHY does ANYONE feel the need to fill our heads and hearts with this disgusting 'story'... which is more like a nightmare I wish I never experienced. I do NOT recommend watching this movie... let alone letting our children (future) watch this movie. Completely disgusting.,1,1,3,5 April 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," One of the worst...
",Can't BELIEVE so many people gave this 10 Stars?? Yeah right. Can't stand this actor as Spiderman... he looks way to SLOW to even be Peter Parker. The story is disjointed and all over the place... mostly spent feeling sorry for people. Sorry... but I do not have an emotional connection to any of these actors. Please stop wasting our time with LAME Marvel Movies that only have to follow the COMICS to be made epic.,1,1,4,21 October 2019
