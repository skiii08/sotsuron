Blade Runner 2049," Great movie!
",It has a little bit of everything. The plot was sophisticated. There is a beautiful love story. Ryan Gosling did a good job acting. It is a mystery - it holds your attention until the very end. It was great to see Harrison Ford make a come-back. Only thing missing is an epic Rutger Hauer-like statement at the very end of the original Blade Runner.,10,5,14,14 October 2017
