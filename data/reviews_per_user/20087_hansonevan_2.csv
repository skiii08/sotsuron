Blade Runner 2049," A technical masterpiece
","Blade Runner 2049 may very well be my favorite movie of 2017. All of the shots in this movie is absolutely perfect. You can pretty much use every single one of them and use it as a beautiful desktop background. It will be an absolute shame if Roger Deakins does not win Best Cinematography at the Oscars this year. Ryan Gosling was awesome as usual and Harrison Ford gave possibly the best performance of his career. Denis Villeneuve proved himself to be one of the best directors working today from such great films such as Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, and Arrival. This movie is in almost every way an improvement to the original. I can see 20 to 30 years from now Blade Runner 2049 will be an influential film to future filmmakers in terms of directing, set design, and cinematography. In every way, Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece. 10/10",10,3,8,11 March 2018
