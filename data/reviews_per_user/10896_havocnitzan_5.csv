The Blair Witch Project," It hasn't aged well, and it didn't have to. You don't have to love it in order to appreciate the genius.
","Not being that in touch with Horror hype I haven't heard about the third Blair Witch installment until rather recently, so I've decided to watch the first films again (it has literally been over a decade). So after watching this title again I checked some of the trivia details and some web articles, a process which has lead me to the unfortunate conclusion that I can't recommend TBWP to any new spectators.The story is quite simple (which is part of why it works). Three film students travel to an old city surrounded by woodlands in pursuit of information about 'The Blair Witch', something between local folklore, an urban legend and a myth. The videotape some sites, interview some locals, and head for the woods for a night of camping before heading back to civilization. That's when things start to get wrong, as the trio gets hopelessly lost, tensions become high and someone (or something) obviously tries to make them feel unwelcome.I know, thinking of that setting almost makes you able to visualize some of the scenes, and most chances are you wouldn't be far from what's actually shown in the film. That's because most Horror fans (and even certain fans of mainstream cinema) have by now seen titles exemplifying how the 'Found Footage' sub-genre has improved and matured over the years (and I'd say it has become boring and tedious, but that's just my own thoughts and isn't relevant). No, in order to appreciate the Blair Witch you had to have been there, way back at the turning point of the millennium, when there still hadn't been a 'Found Footage' sub-genre and perhaps two films (UFO Abduction of 1989 and its remake Alien Abduction of 1998) have ever used the 'documentary' shooting style in a thriller or Horror film. I was too young to take part in the hype, but from I've collected - a website came up telling of a videotape found in a deserted camera in the woods near what used to be the town of 'Blair'. With no reason not to - people believed it. With no information to contradict this intuitive conclusion - people thought they were actually going to watch an authentic found footage. The producers handed out 'Missing' flyers of the students (actually a cast of two actors and an actress) during the debut screening in the festival, the cast itself was forbidden by contract to make any public appearances, and most spectators simply didn't know any better.Think about it. The web page. The characters' names being identical to the cast's names. Missing person flyers. A footage which in all standards looks precisely like a real documentary. Who could have known? Who would have guessed but the cynics and nay-sayers (who have an annoying habit of being right)? Watching the film under the impression the events were real would indeed justify the film being unofficially dubbed 'the scariest movie of all times'. And as much as it might today seem average at best both as a Horror title in general and as a 'Found Footage' film specifically - numbers don't lie: 40k budget, near 300m earnings. That is how you make a legend.If any of the anecdotes (true as far as I've been able to track) mentioned here have made you curious and you wish to experience the thrill over two decades after - go right ahead and watch this, just don't expect to have your mind blown. Remember, this is the film which officially gave birth to the Found Footage sub-genre, it was a cinematic and creative breakthrough, but s was the light bulb (and you're reading this on a computer or portable device). If you'd rather enjoy the legacy - go watch any other Found Footage Horror out there (any Paranormal Activity title comes to mind, of course) and know that it wouldn't be here without the pioneering genius of the Blair Witch Project.",8,3,4,9 February 2020
Interstellar," If you ever have to decide which 'oh my god you have to watch this' film to NOT watch - pick this one.
","Honestly, I very rarely reach the end of a film and really think 'damn, there's two and a half hours I'm never getting back'. While the acting is superb, the story is complete and utter chaos with absolutely no logic and nothing keeping the seemingly related events together. No answers are given, just more questions disguised as answers (the call sign of bad immature writing). I have no idea what Nolan was trying to say here, and I guarantee you most of the viewers feel the same and still feel bad giving an honest rating. Well, I don't. This movie was terrible, atrocious, presumptuous and bluntly stupid. If the end credits make you feel annoyed and frustrated for even giving it a chance - the film is terrible. So even though the media and other biased reviewers here will swear this is some masterpiece - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS CRAP.",1,5,8,18 March 2020
Mama," Exquisite acting, genuinely terrifying, just a little short of a true Horror masterpiece!
","This has been my second time watching Mama, the first was a few years back before I took a fancy to documenting my Horror viewing experiencing. I must start off by saying that while I had remembered the film as pretty good, I didn't remember how remarkable and absolutely exquisite it had been! In a genre plagued by mediocrity and lack of innovation, Mama is a well overdue ray of terrifying darkness, giving the most distinguished titles of the past decade a fair and honest run for their money.The story is creepy, discomforting and heart-squeezing from the start. In a dramatic and terrible turn of events two girls, aged around five and one, find themselves abandoned in an old secluded and decrepit wooden shack. About five years pass before they are finally found and allegedly rescued, five years during which they have miraculously survived. Or perhaps 'miraculous' isn't the right way to put it, as whatever it is that watched over them might not be as benevolent as first thought to be. Then again, it obviously isn't evil (having been the sole factor responsible for the girls' survival)... Or is it?Three things make Mama stand out and flaunt its artistic and horrifying value. First and foremost, the acting. Wow, the acting... While I've always been easily impressed by professional and authentic character-portrayal by younger actors and actresses, little Victoria (Megan Charpentier, 12 years old) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse, 10 years old) are by far two of the most talented young Horror actresses I've ever seen. Following the instructions of writer and director Andy Muschietti, they delivered a masterpiece performance of two little girls removed from human society and deprived of their very humanity, moving, sounding and behaving like beasts of the wild. Even if you watch the first 30 minutes or so and nothing more - Victoria and Lilly's predicament and Charpentier and Nelisse's incredible ability to show and deliver it to the audience are as terrifying as they are amazingly impressive.Second, the smart use of audio effects. I've honestly never been as frightened by how a supernatural antagonist sounds, as opposed to how it looks. The guttural moans, the wimping, the cries and the shrieks of rage would make anyone uncomfortable at least, and terrified at most. Don't get me wrong, the antagonist and namesake of the film looks horrifying (I'll be getting to that soon), but it sounds even worse. Honestly, I could be blind and still have trouble sleeping after 'watching' this.And last but not least, Mama herself. I've been a devout Horror enthusiast for 20 years or so (I'm currently 34) and yet no ghost or creature on screen has ever given me greater chills than Javier Botet as Mama. She doesn't really appear supernatural, more unnatural or even sub-natural. Deformed, revolting and disheartening, the fear of seeing her on screen becomes one of the key Horror factors after the first time she appears. It's like, I wasn't afraid for the characters and of the story as I was of seeing her again, and that's a feature very few Horror antagonist can boast.However, for the sake of objectivity and fairness, certain features of the film could (and indeed should) have been planned and executed better. First, as wisely noted by the review I've read here first (browser refreshed so I can't credit you, sorry!), the antagonist should have been kept more in the shadows, meaning appearing for split microseconds instead of 10 seconds. Seeing her for too long has really diminished her horrifying aura, which I find to be unfortunate. Second, while the ending is pretty realistic given the plot development and is as terrible and discomforting as a Horror ending should be, I couldn't help but feel the film missed the opportunity of a surprising twist (which to me is what makes good Horror great). Amending these two secondary yet significant shortcomings would have made for a solid 10 masterpiece.All in all, Mama is one of the finest, most impressive and most terrifying Horror films I've ever had the terrible pleasure of watching. While this has only been my subjective opinion and others might find this film disappointing - I'd be committing a crime if I didn't recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys the occasional good fright. For a 90 minute Horror film currently available on Netflix it's as rewarding as any Horror fan could hope.",9,0,0,23 July 2019
The Purge," Superb concept, average film.
","Imagine an alternative future, a rather near future, in which the US federal government has created a new 'holiday', during which all crimes (including and particularly murder) are decriminalized for a full 12 hours, starting 7:00 PM. In this future, the sad fact is that accurate data proves that unemployment, poverty and all manners of crime have decreased to the lowest levels in human history, all because citizens are able to 'purge' themselves of all violent and anti-social behaviors, thoughts, emotions and tendencies once a year. How would people react to such freedom? Who would indulge in their darker sides, and who would see it as an affront to society, and indeed their very humanity? And what of those who can't afford weapons, fortifications and security measures? This is the general concept and notion of The Purge.There's a story, which is rather nice; there are characters, which are rather likeable and relatable (or despised, according to their role); there's a cast of actors, out of which some perform adequately and others impressively; but the main feature of The Purge is the moral dilemma, the philosophical, moral and societal debate of the few vs the many, the collective vs the individual, complete natural freedom vs human boundaries. None of the other features are remotely impressive enough to revert the spotlight away from this feature, and I believe this feature is the one thing that remains with the audience after watching the film.So, if you wish to be intrigues and compelled by such a conflict of moralities - I can't recommend The Purge enough, as it's one of the most original and innovative works of this field in cinema to date. It's even suspenseful enough for those who care less about such debates while watching, and have lowered expectations. However, if you're looking for top notch suspense with plot twist and clever screenwriting - The Purge would hardly serve.",7,0,0,1 June 2019
Life," Compelling and suspenseful, incredible ending. Don't miss out on this one.
","If you're a Netflix subscriber and Horror fan, you're probably aware of the challenge of finding a worthy Horror film to watch. While the selection of foreign films is indeed impressive, English films are scarce and many of them turn out to be mediocre at best and forcing a conscious choice to lower one's expectations and standards. Wanting to watch a nice Horror film and not feeling like a foreign one - I've decided to try Life and definitely wasn't disappointed.As I'm sure you've already seen in a trailer or read in a summary, Life tells the story of a space mission to retrieve Martian land samples believed to be containing organic life forms. As expected, said organic life form turns out to be a lot more dangerous than initially perceived by the shuttle's crew, who find themselves forced to fight for survival. However, if you're thinking of a Dead Space, Alien or Starship Troopers scenario - stop right there. The 'alien' is far less fantastic and nefarious and therefore a lot more convincing and authentic. It isn't a terrifying hunter, simply and organism fighting for its own survival and which turns out to be a lot more evolved and superior.The characters are relatable and very likeable despite some pretty unimpressive acting and direction (except for Jake Gyllenhaal, who was incredible, and Ryan Reynolds, who proved beyond a doubt he's much more than an action-comedy actor. Very impressive, way to go Deadpool!). The setting is utterly discomforting due to it being so different and remote from mankind's natural habitat (you know, outer space, no gravity, no air and nowhere to run). However, the plot itself is the main attraction, as it's suspenseful and keeps you at the edge of your seats all the way to the end.And speaking of the end - I'll say it right now, it counts for about 2-3 points in my rating. It's so simple and 'easy' that at first it felt out of place and illogical, but a few second of thinking about it made everything fall into place. It's surprising, despairing and in every way terrible, leaving the audience with a very distinctive knot in their chests. In the Horror genre, combining such a twist with such a feeling (which definitely stays with you for a bit) makes for an excellent ending, and I personally firmly believe anticlimactic endings is perhaps the greatest bane of Horror today.All in all, while lowering your expectations and standards will indeed help you enjoy the film all the more, Life is far from being another average act of mediocracy. It's compelling, suspenseful and terrible and delivers a very highly entertaining Horror experience. While many might disagree with me (as this is all just my personal opinion), I would recommend to anyone and everyone (even those who aren't regular Horror enthusiasts) not to miss out on this one.",8,1,3,4 June 2019
