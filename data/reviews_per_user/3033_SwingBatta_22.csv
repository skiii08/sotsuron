Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'Phantom' plot and characters spell doom for the latest Star Wars epic
","I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a huge Star Wars fan, but the first three movies (or Episodes 4, 5 and 6, for you purists out there) were incredible and blew me away with terrific plots full of suspense and humor, not to mention memorable characters and awesome action sequences.  What kept me from buying the box set was that I received it as a Christmas present. With all this in mind, I readily agreed to see this latest installment, expecting it to easily be the cream of the crop in terms of visual effects and storytelling.However, when the end credits rolled, I hadn't experienced any of the above; instead what resulted was a rather empty `Is that it?' feeling.  I fell into the exact same trap when I went to see `Independence Day' back in the summer of '96.  Just like ID4, this was an incredibly overhyped movie which you force yourself to find any redeeming points in, trying to suppress the nagging feeling that you wasted your money.  Oh well, with a lousy title like `The Phantom Menace,' I suppose I was doomed from the start.And, yes, TPM did have some redeeming points, but, unfortunately, they're overshadowed - no, eclipsed - by a weak, uninspired plot, `been there, done that' special effects and drab characters.As mildly simplistic as the first three plots were, there was something magical and thrilling about them that kept your eyes stuck to the screen for every frame.  In TPM, the thin story about the Trade Federation vs. the citizens of Naboo was about as exciting as a minnow bucket, probably because it lost me far before the film was halfway through.The characters lacked the spark, and were shadows of, their famous predecessors.  Qui-Gon and the young Ben Kenobi (Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor) were adequate enough, but Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and Jar Jar Binks - forget racism; people should have cried stupidity over this instead - grated on my nerves quickly.  Many roles were wasted, most notably Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, which probably translates to `One who sits and does nothing for all five minutes of his screen time.'  Face it, these guys aren't exactly Princess Leia and Han Solo, folks.But what really confused, not to mention bothered, the hell out of me was that Darth Maul (Ray Park), quite possibly the film's biggest cash cow (hell, he's on everything except pantyhose and Zippo lighters), has a grand total of 5-10 minutes on screen, before his inevitable dispatch in the end. Say what?!Some scenes dragged horribly, such as Anakin's parting from his mother, his long conversation in what looked like a chop shop with Weebo - who looked like a fat, demonic bumblebee - and the early underwater scene with Jar Jar and his clan.  Boredom resulted, and in huge portions. Queen Amidala's (Natalie Portman) emotion seemed to have been drowned out in all that white KISS-style face paint, though she does redeem herself somewhat by pulling double duty as Padme.The visual effects were certainly nothing to write home about, save for the amazing podrace sequence and the jaw-dropping 3-way lightsaber dance at the end, the latter easily my (and millions of others', no doubt) favorite sequence in the whole movie.  But, the film made its biggest impact on me when I was watching this spunky, innocent kid while realizing he's going to grow up and eventually become Darth Vader.Overall, I think it's safe to say that George Lucas pretty much coasted on his reputation and the `Star Wars' name for this movie, as TPM is nothing more than an empty husk of what easily should have been.  Then again, if I sat on my can for 15 years between SW films, I'd have probably produced a similar result. Needless to say, the jury will be out on #2, which will be released next year.Sadly enough, save for the lightsaber fight, there isn't one memorable, historical sequence in TPM, which we all know ran aplenty in the first three.  There are enough famous quotes and highlights from 4, 5 and 6 that could fill the Chrysler Building.It's easy to get caught up in the moment when a `blockbuster' like this first hits theaters, but then you see the luster wear off and you're left with a feeling of disappointment. At the FAO Schwartz out here, nearly every bit of TPM merchandise - nearly a whole floor of the stuff - has been discounted pretty heavily. Ouch.And to think some people actually camped out on the streets outside theaters in hopes of being the first to watch this.  Really makes you wonder how most of them feel today about such a dubious feat.  6/10",6,0,1,8 August 2000
Minority Report," Repellent imagery hurts solid plot in overlong 'Report'
","John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of the Department of Precrime, a police force that apprehends suspects before crimes are committed. When he himself is suddenly accused of being a future killer, he is forced to go on the run as he strives to prove his innocence. In the vein of last year's futile 'A.I.', Steven Spielberg presents yet another claustrophobic and depressing glance into the future with disappointing results. The promising mystery yarn suffers from a hodgepodge of perplexing subplots involving crooked cops, Anderton's deceased son, and a psychic (Samantha Morton) with a checkered past, plus plenty of gruesome imagery (this film is an optometrist's worst nightmare). 'Report' runs an excruciating 144 minutes and is saved only by its intricate climax. It's not a horrible film but just simply an unpleasant viewing experience, due to its infatuation with repulsive scenes of Ziploc-bagged eyeballs, futuristic whorehouses and blatant product placement, all brought to us by the man who once thought of Haley Joel Osment as the ideal Harry Potter.  3/10",Null,0,0,4 August 2002
The Fan," Only the acting prevents 'The Fan' from striking out
","While Ridley Scott ('Alien,' 'Blade Runner') continues to get the pick of the litter, younger brother Tony ('Days of Thunder,' 'The Last Boy Scout') is sometimes relegated to the leftovers, and 'The Fan' is no exception. Unemployed knife salesman and San Francisco Giants fan Gil Renard (Robert DeNiro) is obsessed with his favorite player, $40 million acquisition Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes). When Rayburn suffers through the worst slump of his career, Renard is more than willing to do anything to help him break out of it. It plays just as hokey as it sounds and is saved by good acting from a strong cast. Snipes has little to do in the thankless jock role but makes the most of it, and John Leguizamo is memorable as Rayburn's sleazy agent, but DeNiro, way over the top here but through no fault of his own, is more Max Patkin than Max Cady in a film that contains moderate bang for the buck yet ultimately fails to generate any actual thrills. 'The Fan' tries to include a commentary on the relationship between high-priced ballplayers and the fans who pay their salary (one memorable line: 'We're the ones who get you your $40 [expletive] million'), but it's drowned out by the tepid script, frenzied cinematography, and director Scott's peculiar fixation with the Nine Inch Nails catalog. The telltale sign that 'The Fan' doesn't deliver as a thriller is when the most memorable scene consists of DeNiro swallowing his pride and shaving his legs with a hunting knife during in-store demonstrations. 7/10",Null,0,2,2 August 2003
That Thing You Do!," 'That Thing' is wonderfully done with irresistible style and substance
","That Thing You Do! (1996): There are so many great things about this film that it's impossible to single out just one. The script, the acting, the characters...to paraphrase that old car commercial, who could ask for anything more? Oh, and throw in some pretty darn addictive music to boot. Add everything together, stir well and the result is a terrific directorial debut for Tom Hanks. 'That Thing You Do!' tells the tale of a (fictitious) band, The Wonders, who literally become an overnight sensation after winning a talent competition and soon find themselves experiencing the highs  not to mention the lows  of becoming rock stars. The band members  Guy (Tom Everett Scott), Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech), Lenny (Steve Zahn), and the unnamed bass player (Ethan Embry) are perfectly cast, as are supporting characters such as Jimmy's girlfriend Faye (Liv Tyler), Guy's brusque father (Holmes Osborne), mattress tycoon Boss Vic Koss (Kevin Pollak), down-on-his-luck drummer Chad (Giovanni Ribisi), jazz great Del Paxton (Bill Cobbs), with the best being Lamarr the hotel doorman (Obba Babatunde). Despite Hanks' considerably large amount of screen time as the band's manager, his role is restrained enough so as not to overshadow the film's young players. The acting is superbly enhanced by the terrific script; the dialogue is razor-sharp and at times very humorous, with the funniest moments involving the conception of the band's name (spelled 'The One-ders' early on as a gag on the Beatles, it's constantly mispronounced as 'The O-neders' before finally being changed to the literal spelling). Nothing ever resorts to condescension, explicit language or sensuality, or forced comedy. You can't help but share in the Wonders' ecstasy when they hear their single on the radio for the first time. The title song never gets boring even though it's played a grand total of 11 times (yet only twice in its entirety). The production design is outstanding, especially Guy's father's appliance store (where did they find all those gadgets?). TTYD is recommended viewing for any budding rock band, or simply for those who want to travel back to a time when music wasn't polluted with countless no-talent, assembly-line boy bands, misogynist rappers, and the like. Finally, we have a feel-good movie that actually lives up to that otherwise overused title. 9/10",9,3,4,5 February 2002
The Mummy," Exciting and funny
","I don't care what anyone says, I liked this movie. To me it was both thrilling (nothing scary about it, though) and funny (Kevin O'Connor was hilarious as Beni), which is a rare combination nowadays. Historically accurate or not, it's one way to possibly attract viewers to Egyptian mythology. I'll admit, one thing I enjoyed was seeing how one of the co-stars was going to get bumped next, as opposed to the tiresome bullet-in-the-brain routine. The script wasn't great, but it hardly matters. I particularly liked Rachel Weisz and John Hannah as her bumbling brother. I bought the video the day it came out and it was my favorite movie of the year until 'Sleepy Hollow' was released (another great combination of comedy and thrills). Overall, 'The Mummy' is definitely worth checking out. If you haven't seen it yet, rent or buy a copy today.",9,0,0,23 November 1999
The Others," Sluggish 'Others' saves its best for last
","An ambitious disappointment, 'The Others' is one reason why I hardly take word-of-mouth from critics and viewers, positive and negative alike, into account when I go to the movies. Directed by Alejandro Amenabar (and featuring an executive producer credit for Tom Cruise), this film's strong points include solid but unspectacular acting that is enhanced by the cinematography and production design that nicely enhance a foreboding, isolated English mansion and spacious surrounding grounds (which were all filmed on location in Spain), but it is overshadowed by its incredibly slow pace and thin, recycled plot (which unfortunately has led to inevitable conclusions to 'The Sixth Sense'). It is backed up by a flimsy score that descends into silliness during tense moments, thus killing their effectiveness.As she should, Nicole Kidman provides the film's best performance as Grace, who, despite the insistence of her young daughter (Alakina Mann), refuses to believe that there may be ghosts inhabiting her house, where she pines away every day while waiting for her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) to return home from the war.She takes in three new servants - a codger (Eric Sykes), a mute (Elaine Cassidy), and a crone (Fionnula Flanagan, who, for some reason, reminded me of the maid portrayed by Hermione Baddeley in 'Mary Poppins'), after her previous help mysteriously disappears, but there is a lot more to this strange trio than she could possibly imagine.Mann and James Bentley, respectively, make their first big screen appearances as Anne and Nicholas, two youngsters who have a potentially fatal allergy to light - or who are 'photosensitive,' as Grace verbalizes it - which results in an exhausting routine to make sure every door and shutter in the house is always shut and every curtain always drawn. It's a subplot that doesn't have much of an impact on the film as a whole.Despite 'The Others' being hailed for its suspense factor, all the suspense is couched into the last thirty minutes. The early scenes in which Anne insists that there are indeed supernatural visitors lurking about (in particular a little boy named Victor), which lead to Grace's eventual inspection of her surroundings, have no punch at all - save for one sequence in which Grace discovers an old photo album - because it's too predictable and...well, boring. It's something we've all seen a million times before. The music repeatedly hams up the 'scare that's not really there' schtick, which quickly became tiresome.But there's no denying the impact of the ending, which saves 'The Others' from becoming a total disaster and what makes the needle spin on the adrenalin meter. I can't speak for everyone, of course, nor will I reveal any details, but the unexpected swerve completely dispelled anything I had theorized.One thing that this film should be commended for, despite its failure in the scare department, is the fact that it succeeds for the most part in presenting a ghost story that doesn't rely on intense special effects or blood and gore (in fact, there's not one drop of the red stuff to be seen anywhere), instead relying on good old fashioned storytelling.While 'The Others' didn't work for me - and don't knock me for not understanding the plot; I grasped it plenty, thank you - it definitely will do the trick for horror/suspense fans who are sick of the ineptitude of dreck like the 'Scream' series and who yearn for the days of good ghost stories once shared around the campfire. 6/10",5,0,0,11 November 2001
Chicken Run," Son of a gun, 'Chicken Run' is pure fun!
","After watching 'Chicken Run,' you will become a believer of many things.You will believe that a bunch of talking hens wearing beads and bandanas can speak with British and Scottish accents, practice martial arts, escape from inside a pie machine and secretly plot their getaway from an egg farm in 1955 England. You will believe that chickens can knit, dance, wear glasses and play the harmonica.  You will believe that rats can wear bad suits and have an obsession for eggs. You will believe that roosters can fly airplanes, ride a tricycle and sing  'The Wanderer.'Most importantly, you will believe that the otherwise Disney-choked world of animated films has life again, and that a tiny British studio can top the big boys from Japan and the U.S. and turn out the smartest, possibly best work of this genre ever.  The one point of light in an otherwise lousy summer movie season, 'Chicken Run' is something you'll want to watch over and over again. You could sit through it 31 times (like yours truly) and it never gets boring. The audienced applauded at the end during my first 13 viewings.Aardman Studios has concocted a recipe consisting of a wonderful (albeit portly and feathered) cast, a funny, intelligent script, a gripping score, excellent cinematography and production design, plus great voice work, all mixed with years of labor and love, and the result is what is easily the best film of 2000. When was the last time you saw a movie with a cast  nearly all-female, no less  so determined and believable in their mission for freedom, and whom you cared so strongly about that you were actually cheering for them to be successful?'Chicken Run' may be the first animated film that is an absolute joy for both children and adults. Children will be tickled by the jocularity of these hens, while adults will find pleasure in discovering homages to classic prison films  'The Great Escape,' 'Stalag 17' and even 'The Shawshank Redemption,' among others.Screenwriter Karey Kirkpatrick has come up with a sharp script, which has all but become a lost art in the movie world these days.  The dialogue is loaded with puns that work so well.  The British slang is a delight, and makes the chickens' personalities more endearing and  dare I say it  human.One of the best lines comes from Mrs. Tweedy talking lovingly about her soon-to-be chicken pie enterprise. When Mr. Tweedy asks why she only will be included in the brand name, her reply is: 'Woman's touch. Makes the public feel more comfortable.'  The other is Fowler's immortal 'Pushy Americans, always showing up late for every war.' That's simply brilliant writing.The flawless (yes, flawless) voice cast is the heart of this movie. This is one of those rare films in which both the heroes and the villains are fun to watch. You'll find yourself thinking during the end credits, 'I liked this character the bestno, wait a minute, I think I like this one moreno, no, I like that one.'Leading the way is Julia Sawalha, playing another character with a spicy name (from 'AbFab's' Saffy to CR's Ginger), and providing the ideal heroine we moviegoers have yearned for so long. She's so convincing in this role; you're deeply immensed in Ginger's quest for free range living that you forget she's a Plasticine chicken.It's safe to say that 2000 has been the summer of one Melvin Gibson. He doesn't disappoint with 'The Patriot' or with his role as Rocky, the vagabond flying rooster (listen to his hysterical rendition of Dion's 'The Wanderer'), who easily bested his squirrel namesake at the box office. The film pokes fun at him in a good-natured way, from his opening 'Braveheart' gag to his nationality.Rounding out the supporting cast is Lynn Ferguson as the genius Mac, she of the wild hen's comb and odd spectacles.  Jane Horrocks is a show-stopper as the innocent yetwell, bubbleheaded, knitter Babs.  She doesn't have much dialogue, but definitely does the most with the least as she delivers the funniest lines in the movie with aplomb.  Perhaps the film's most famous line is when she bawls 'I don't want to be a pie!' Why? 'I don't like gravy.'Ben Whitrow's Fowler, the old military rooster, had me in stitches with his constant rambling about his glory days in the Royal Air Force.  Seriously, wouldn't we all want to be awakened by a rooster who hollers, 'Cock-a-doodle-doo, what what'?Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels are a hoot as Nick and Fetcher, the Laurel & Hardy-style farm rats. Tony Haygarth and Miranda Richardson (not straying very far from her 'evil wife' role in 'Sleepy Hollow') are perfect as Willard and Melisha Tweedy, the cruel owners of the prison camper, egg farm. The loving couple is an evil version of American Gothic rendered in clay. Mrs. Tweedy is the best animated villain since Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty.'But my favorite (and this was a tough choice) was Imelda Staunton as the brusque, oversized and argumentative, yet lovable, Bunty. She was the character I related to most because my personality is sometimes like hersI think I may have finally found my role model! My favorite part in the film was watching Bunty getting down to 'Flip Flop and Fly.'The ending contains the most thrilling action sequence I've seen all year. I won't dare describe it herego and experience the magic for yourself.  What I will say is that I haven't had this much side-splitting fun with an ending since 'Mrs. Doubtfire.'I haven't enjoyed a film like this since 'Sleepy Hollow' was released 7 months earlierneedless to say, this has been a period of movie ecstasy that is as rare as hens' teeth, so to speak.  I'm sure nobody will care, but what I found interesting about 'Chicken Run' was that it bore a striking resemblance to SH in terms of the plot: a small citizenry, kept prisoner by a villain who has a fetish for decapitation, pins their hopes of freedom on an outsider who is brash and sure of himself on the outside, yet soft and bewildered on the inside.  Both movies are in my personal top 10 of all time.After watching this, I dare anyone to find another movie that is as heartwarming, witty, suspenseful and funny as 'Chicken Run.' To those who feel the need to criticize this film for any reasonI deeply sympathize with your lack of soul. 10/10",10,71,81,22 August 2000
Insomnia," There's nothing sleepy whatsoever about thrilling 'Insomnia'
","'Insomnia' is a unique movie for one particular reason: Rarely have I come across a picture that is strikingly compelling due to its stereotypes. This is another excellent entry in the murder-mystery genre to come down the pike in the past several months, proceeding last year's 'From Hell' and, more recently, the grossly underrated 'Murder By Numbers.'Al Pacino stars as Will Dormer, a Los Angeles detective sent to the minuscule town of Nightmute, Alaska to assist in the investigation of the murder of a 17-year-old girl. From the moment he sets foot in the police station, he immediately begins barking orders to his coworkers like Tommy Lee Jones in 'The Fugitive.' A cliche Mutt-and-Jeff interrogation session with the first suspect, the victim's sleazy, abusive boyfriend (Jonathan Jackson), in an empty classroom soon follows.As he attempts to apprehend a suspect holed up in a wooden shack, Dormer, almost completely blinded by the fog-enshrouded surroundings, inadvertently shoots and kills his partner, Eckhart (Martin Donovan). He immediately compounds his fatal mistake by hiding his guilt and not telling anyone about it, even going as far as resorting to evidence tampering when he replaces the bullet from his gun with a slug from the suspect's discarded .38 revolver.The evidence regarding the girl's murder suddenly takes a turn and points to Walter Finch (Robin Williams), a mystery writer idolized by the victim, as she owned many of his books. Dormer, his world already a living hell that's gradually increasing due to his partner's death and the Alaskan atmosphere (the sun is still shining in full force even after hours), finds himself playing impromptu phone tag with Finch. The film then becomes a game of human chess of sorts as both men meet in different locations, ranging from ferryboats to desolate roadsides in order to exchange words. Dormer goes as far to plant evidence in Finch's apartment (which is just as poorly lit as nearly every other indoor location in the film despite the sun shining round the clock). Meanwhile, local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) begins to conduct an investigation of her own: Eckhart's death. These two subplots graft together to form a mildly exciting yet somewhat predictable climax.To make a long story short, the acting is superb. As the emotionally tormented officer, this is easily Pacino's best role since the superb 1997 thriller 'Donnie Brasco.' On the other side of the coin, after the utterly horrible 'Death to Smoochy' (which, if not for 'Resident Evil,' would undisputedly be the worst film of the year), Williams is terrific as Finch, though the character is a bit of a mild Hannibal Lecter ripoff with the 'killer-playing-mind-games' schtick; still, it's a refreshing change from his usual, comically overblown screen personas. Swank, despite being given time to shine on her own as she tries to solve the case of Eckhart's death, is not as convincing as Burr, but it's somewhat understandable considering she's all but overshadowed by her Academy Award-winning brethren.Unlike the unconventional 'Murder by Numbers,' 'Insomnia' pretty much plays by the familiar crime-thriller book: a body is found, clues gathered (in which the one crucial piece of evidence pops up near the end), primarily in dingy, dirty locations, capped off with the big showdown of good against evil. It's a timeworn pattern that's been repeated time and again, and yet I still feel that rush of excitement whenever these scenes occur. Such otherwise been-there-done-that scenes are instead suspenseful and played out beautifully, making them worth keeping your eyes on, and this is no exception. It's just something I never get tired of. It's what separates the great films from the rest of the pack.'Insomnia' is not a film that will bowl you over or bombast you with jolting imagery like 'Murder By Numbers' or 'Seven,' but it is a solid film nevertheless. While the script does suffer from occasional slowdowns due to any real lack of energy, it is the essential thinking person's movie that allows us to interact with its involving plot and characters while keeping us guessing, which is what really counts. After all, isn't that the best thing about mysteries in the first place? 8.5/10",Null,4,7,19 June 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Best movie of the 1990s. No ifs, ands or buts.
","I saw the preview for `Sleepy Hollow,' where the main character is a forensics expert/detective, a week before its release when I went to see the tepid `Bone Collector,' which, ironically, also dealt with a forensics expert as the main character.  The preview was well done, but when I discovered who was starring and directing, it became an afterthought. Then, something inexplicable must've happened because I relented and decided to see SH after all when it was released.Well, what followed were 22 viewings in 39 days until it was pulled from my local theater.  Now, a film has to be pretty damn good to warrant such a hot streak. I simply haven't seen anything this awesome in years.  SH has everything: great plot (I'm sorry, but anyone who calls this a `Scooby Doo' mystery didn't pay much attention to the story), colorful characters, incredible visuals  was I the only one who liked Ichabod's dream sequences?  and phenomenal production design.  This is the first film that's commanded my attention through every frame; no scene ever lags or gets boring.  Heck, this movie has more Vans than U-Haul (as in 3 Tassels, 2 Garretts, a Brunt played by a Dien, and a Ripper), and more faints than a Backstreet Boys concert. What's not to like here?I won't delve into the plot since everybody knows it by now, but I will say that transforming Ichabod Crane from the lanky schoolteacher into a constable (a word I will always associate with `Mary Poppins') was a terrific idea, and since I am a huge fan of police/detective stories, this was right up my alley. The special effects fit like an old shoe; that's how natural they looked.  Granted, SH is hardly scary but it puts any modern bunk like the insipid `Scream' series, which go for blatant blood and guts rather than an actual plot to scare viewers, to shame.
Every performance in SH is beyond my reproach, especially Johnny Depp's, and I don't count myself among his fans. This blows away his previous top effort, `Donnie Brasco,' because it takes more talent to pull off an Ichabod Crane than a Joe Pistone.  His Crane, deeply committed to his occupation, is perhaps the most believable action hero, as opposed to the usual muscleheads usually seen in the action/detective genre (ahem, Arnie). He is a perfect combination of Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Clouseau as he has no problem performing autopsies yet freaks out at the sights of blood, spiders and horseback riders without heads, like any of us would.  He may also be the most nonviolent hero in recent memory: he never raised a hand to or threatened anyone, he played peacemaker (or tried to, anyway) on several occasions, didn't swear or spout any misogynistic lines, and for all the times he pulled his gun, he fired only once while trying to protect his two charges from the Horseman. His grand speech in the notary's office was simply amazing.Christina Ricci is equally impressive as Katrina Van Tassel, though I was disappointed at how she downplayed her character. `I play the stereotypical damsel in distress,' she says.  To me, she was the opposite.  Rather than a sexpot stagnating on the sidelines, she was part of the action: assisting Ichabod in his investigation (an early version of the script had her helping Ichabod dig out a grave), leaping onto a horse from a speeding carriage and jumping from a flaming windmill.  Some have complained about their `romance,' yet I instead considered it a very genuine friendship.  Her delivery was excellent as she goes to market with this role.  There is a particularly touching moment with her and Young Masbath (awesome Marc Pickering, who is everything Macaulay Culkin should have been) in the Western Woods. Her singing `Pickety Witch' made my blood run cold. Never mind Depp being nearly twice her age, it doesn't hinder their relationship. She just might be the first case of a miscast character that instead has a positive effect on a movie.The supporting cast stood out well with the lead players; they fit into the film nicely and no role was overshadowed.  All  the Van Tassels and the town elders (1799's version of Grumpy Old Men), among others (including much-maligned Casper Van Dien as Brom  give the guy a break already, folks), were fun to watch, particularly Michael Gough as the notary, but with his body language, notably his plodding like a rusty Tin Man from a funeral.Who better than Chris Walken to play the fanged, pre-headless Hessian? Let's face it, it would've killed the spooky, maniacal aura of his character if he had any spoken lines. Seeing Christopher Lee (who was an absolute steal for 1997's terrific `The Odyssey,' also produced by Francis Coppola) was a nice treat as well.Some of my favorite performances were also by the Killian family (Steven Waddington, Claire Skinner and Sean Stephens). The line `Don't pick your teeth, you teach Thomas bad habits!' always made me smile.However, I'd be lying if I said SH was a perfect movie. I thought the characters of Lady Van Tassel and Brom were somewhat underdeveloped. I was disappointed with the ending only that I had expected it to have the oomph `Seven' did (considering who wrote the screenplay), but this is merely small potatoes as the climax formidably holds its own anyway.  The runaway carriage scene left me slack-jawed; this is what today's lackluster car chases should take notes from.  The Headless Horseman leaves Darth Maul from last May's disappointing `Phantom Menace' and any other horror villains in the dust. Incredible swordplay, especially in the fight under the famous covered bridge.Go see this right away, you won't be disappointed.  This was the final film I saw for the millennium...perfect. If SH does not garner any Oscar nominations in the technical categories, then I'll make someone tie me up with telephone wire and watch `The Postman' for 24 hours straight. 10/10",10,0,0,17 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Thanks to 'Clones,' 'Star Wars' series back with a vengeance
","Over a decade (or, in our time, three years) has passed since the events seen in 'Phantom Menace.' A militant separatist movement, composed of thousands of star systems, threatens to secede from the Republic.  Led by the enigmatic former Jedi, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), the separatist military forces vastly outnumber the declined ranks of Jedi Knights, most of which are spread throughout the galaxy. Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), formerly the queen of Naboo, returns to the galactic capital of Coruscant in order to cast her vote on whether or not to assist the overwhelmed Jedi by creating an Army of the Republic, which she believes will only serve as a catalyst for war. After narrowly escaping an assassination attempt, Padme is reunited with Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) who are assigned to protect her.A second attempt on her life forces the senator to flee to Naboo with Anakin while Obi-Wan seeks to unravel the mystery behind Padme's assassin. As Anakin and Padme develop romantic feelings for each other, Obi-Wan makes several startling discoveries, which may change the fate of the Republic forever.To say that 'Attack of the Clones' is better than 'The Phantom Menace' is too easy. It's also too obvious. It's clear that Lucas wised up after the jumble of three summers ago, and it pays off in spades. The second installment of the new 'Star Wars' trilogy is better than its predecessor in nearly every aspect, especially the plot. It's no less convoluted than in 'Menace,' but it's somewhat easier to follow and more enticing. (I admit, I attribute most of my understanding of the plot to my ever-patient brother, because I played '20 Questions' with him virtually all throughout the picture.)The characters are intertwined together nicely, and there are plenty of awesome action sequences that advance the plot rather than just serve as fancy CGI exhibitions. A spectacular chase sequence in which Obi-Wan and Anakin pursue an assassin through Coruscant, a neon-lit city complete with flying cars (think 'The Fifth Element' done ten times better), leads into an investigation by Obi-Wan on who may have been responsible for the attempt on his life. It's a great subplot that plays like something out of 'The X-Files.' McGuinness - oops! - McGregor gives arguably the best performance of the picture, and he looks more at ease in the role this time around.
The sets and backgrounds are simply awesome, particularly the 'Blade Runner'-like futuristic city of Coruscant. Obi-Wan battles Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) on the rooftop of a unique apartment building somewhere on the planet Kamino, and in the pouring rain no less. Best of all is a spectacular dark red desert-type backdrop that Anakin zips through on a flying bike in his attempt to reunite with his long-lost mother, whom, as you may remember, he had been separated from in the previous film.Much like the film itself, its centerpiece has improved with age as well. His hot-and-cold performance notwithstanding, Christensen is a major improvement over his pint-sized predecessor, who dragged the first film to occasional, mildly unwatchable levels. Anakin's spoiled-brat personality here is forgivable since we all know it's going to come into fruition in the third installment. A genuinely chilling and crucial turning point involving his character occurs late in the picture, and it definitely strikes a chord.
The witty sense of humor that went on hiatus in 'Menace' is back in the form of C-3PO. Though his role is still somewhat insignificant to the storyline, he serves as the comic relief that surprisingly doesn't interfere with the intensity of the conclusion while adding a bit of levity. Best of all, Jar Jar Binks' role is mercifully shaved down. Meanwhile, it's slightly difficult to get excited over Christopher Lee's role as Count Dooku, because his screen time is considerably small, but it all pays off near the conclusion in a priceless showdown with none other than Yoda. Describing any of it here won't do it justice, nor would it be right.Yes, fellow moviegoers, we can all breathe easier now. Everything is all right again in the Star Wars universe. One can only assume that the impending success of the 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of The Rings' series lit a fire under Lucas' proverbial rear. Let's hope that this upswing is not coincidental, and that the third film will be even better. Heck, what's another three-year wait? 8/10",Null,0,0,27 July 2002
The Bourne Identity," Great plot and action distance 'Bourne' far from the pack
","Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has a nasty case of amnesia after being plucked unconscious out of the Mediterranean Sea, but it's not long until he discovers that he was a trained assassin for the CIA. One problem, though: he's now marked for death from the very organization he used to work for. With the unexpected assistance of a Swiss woman (Franka Potente, in a surprisingly strong performance), whom he pays $20,000 for a ride to Paris, Bourne struggles to regain memory of his past while trying to stay alive. The solid screenplay  based on the late Robert Ludlum's bestselling 1980 novel  by Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron is well crafted and finely paced, complete with solid dialogue and some great action sequences, such as what turns out to be one of the film's best scenes: a thrilling car chase with a Cooper Mini (!) through the streets of Paris, which is accented with great cinematography and music by Paul Oakenfold. 'Bourne' is a most refreshing alternative that distances itself from the nonsense that's been clogging theaters all year. If Damon surgically removed himself from Ben Affleck, he'd be a worldwide phenomenon after movies like this. 8.5/10",Null,0,1,9 September 2002
The Patriot," Strong albeit one-sided war epic packs a punch
","The Patriot (2000): Director Roland Emmerich's surprisingly entertaining work stars Mel Gibson as Benjamin Martin (loosely based on war hero Francis Marion), an American farmer abstaining from the Revolutionary War after previously fighting in the French and Indian Conflict. But when one of his children is murdered by British Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), he changes his mind at the flip of a switch and takes up arms alongside his eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger). It sounds schmaltzy, but the plot plays well and, despite the lengthy running time (2 hours, 45 minutes), keeps a steady pace that is fueled by Robert Rodat's solid script, which is a nice combination of suspense and humor and is acted out by a strong cast. The one serious defect is the unflattering portrayal of the British, which becomes excessive and unnerving at times. Sure, it's a fictitious work, but the filmmakers really should have known better. 8/10",8,0,1,13 April 2002
Spider-Man," Middle-of-the-pack 'Spider-Man' doesn't live up to expectations
","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a nerdy high school photojournalist, is regularly harassed by his classmates, and has a crush on beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He is bitten by a genetically altered spider during a science field trip, and soon develops spider-powers such as climbing walls and shooting webs from his wrist. He evolves into Spider-Man in an interesting yet ridiculous way: he poses as 'The Human Spider'  complete with a cheap prototype of his familiar costume  for a wrestling match. (A sad sight is watching the washed-up Randy 'Macho Man' Savage play his in-ring opponent.) This leads to the evolution of the crime-fighting Spider-Man we've grown to love, and it's the baffled Parker's discoveries of his newfound abilities that provide the film's funniest moments. The acting is decent  Cliff Robertson plays Peter's Uncle Ben, and Willem Dafoe hams it up as Norman Osborn (better known as The Green Goblin, Spidey's nemesis), but J.K. Simmons nearly steals the show as blowhard newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson. They're enough to momentarily make us forget about Dunst's bland damsel-in-distress performance, which consists mainly of screaming her head off quite often. The script, unfortunately, gets stuck in the hell of movie limbo: the content is too violent for younger viewers and too juvenile for older ones (the kissing-in-the-rain sequence seems little more than an excuse to have Dunst in a wet T-shirt). Though a serviceable film, 'Spider-Man' falls far short of its blockbuster hype. Even before setting foot in the theater, I knew it wouldn't knock me out. It's also somewhat deflating to watch the early obligatory montage of various crooks being caught in Spidey's web; it's fun to watch, yet upon leaving the theater it becomes a depressing reminder of all the nonsense going on in the world that a web-slinging superhero wearing a blue and red mask and tights would be hard-pressed to resolve.  7/10",Null,0,0,21 September 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Fast cars, furious action, comatose plot
","'The Fast and The Furious,' directed by Rob Cohen and based on a magazine article about street racing, was undoubtedly one of the 'in' movies during the summer of 2001, grossing over $140 million.To label it a 'surprise hit' was erroneous. 'Furious' was going to succeed no matter what, because, to put it bluntly, it was a dual-gratification film. The girls were aroused at its pretty-boy hunk stars, and the guys likewise at the four-wheeled penile extensions  I mean the gaudy, overgarnished import cars.And after finally seeing it almost a year later, I wholeheartedly agree that it was 'in,' all right: inept, inane, insipid, and inferior.The plot has undercover cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) infiltrating a street-racing gang suspected of stealing and fencing electronic equipment. They spend the money on modifications to their rice burners, such as blowing $10,000 on speed-increasing nitrous oxide tanks. As Brian is accepted into the criminal fraternity by the gang leader, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), he also finds himself falling for Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster). Sure enough  you guessed it  Brian is increasingly hesitant to apprehend Dom for the thefts as their friendship grows over time. It sounds just as bad as it plays.I knew the script for 'Furious' would be embarrassing, considering that it plays second banana to moving hunks of glass and steel, and I wasn't disappointed. I've read better dialogue on a cereal box. I mean, how can you beat lines like 'Damn, that guy's fast!' and 'Hey, bro, you got a bathroom?'It's obvious the male leads were cast for their looks. Beach bum-looking Walker is hardly believable as a police officer or a street racer. Most of his close-ups show him staring at his co-stars with a blank half-grin. His attempt at sounding cool consists of, 'Check it out, it's like this.' If he wins the film's opening race, then he'll 'get the money and the respect.' (A telltale sign that he's a cop: he's the only driver in the entire movie who bothers to wear a seatbelt.)I must've been on another planet when it was decided that Diesel was the next big star in the making. Whatever the case may be, his popularity certainly isn't due to his acting. Here, he is emotionless when speaking lines that don't require him to scream, and as a result he sounds like he's reading off a teleprompter. He is victimized by poor dialogue as much as Walker; at one point, when Dom wistfully says to Brian, 'I live my life a quarter mile at a time,' I wanted to spray the screen with Airwick.Early in the film, Dom and his buddies refer to Brian as 'the buster.' Does anyone even use that term anymore?Incredibly enough, both Walker and Diesel are outdone by Michelle Rodriguez in her unintentionally hysterical role of Dom's girlfriend. She performs the most grueling duty of the picture: standing around for ninety minutes with a permanent pout on her face. Then again, if I had lines like 'Why don't you skate before I leave treadmarks on your face?' my lower lip would be protruding like a diving platform.Save for Brewster as Mia, the script prevents viewers from sympathizing with the poorly developed characters. As a result, any expressions of sentimentality come off as artificial. We don't feel sorry for characters who get shot at while stuck on an 18-wheeler, suffer a horrific car crash, or are gunned down in a drive-by shooting.The other type of race figures prominently in 'Furious,' and the script gives it the finger by playing up stereotypes to the hilt. All the Mexican men wear khaki shorts and tall socks; one cracks racist jokes and 'has a last name but can't pronounce it.' Dom and Brian are harassed by motorcycle-riding, machine gun-toting Asians led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). Meanwhile, the Black crowd is so well-represented by Ja Rule in a spellbinding performance. (If you couldn't sense the sarcasm here, then you shouldn't be reading this.) When he talks, he sounds like he needs a Breathe-Right strip. Not surprisingly, he is the source of the film's only 'F' word during his mercifully brief screen time.Big shock  the women are portrayed as nothing more than scantily-clad armpieces in short skirts. Their sole purpose is to stand around while the cameras pan up from their ankles. The extras at the first race all cheer and jeer right on cue like Pavlov's dogs as Dom rambles about car parts. Perhaps they were amazed at his usage of big words.However, not everything is the fault of the actors. Much of 'Furious' is just outright nonsense.For starters, I've hardly ever seen any cars that are covered in all those psychedelic graphics. The race and chase sequences suffer greatly at the hands of a combination of choppy editing and an overbearing rap soundtrack. Plus, what part of Los Angeles is deserted both day and night, and where does such a huge stretch of road exist on which four cars can race side-by-side while going over 140 miles an hour (that's over two miles per minute; I doubt that nearly eight miles of a city street can be illegally blocked off by spectators)? Are there always so many lead changes in such a short race? How can the characters afford these cars? Can someone go flipping and flying about in a '69 Charger, crash and then walk away with barely a scratch? How can Brian burn out his engine after hitting 140 and then drive away an instant later, or take his eyes off the road for long stretches of time during a race in order to operate not one, but two laptop computers?If I was a cop who was incompetent enough to let my prime suspect get away ('I owe you a ten-second car,' Brian tells Dom before forking over the keys), my career would soon be in cinders after I was terminated for assisting in a criminal's escape.'The Fast and The Furious' would have fared better had the script been as eye-popping as the cars. This movie does remain true to the essence of its subject matter in one aspect: it's one hell of a drag. 3/10",3,2,5,27 February 2002
Spirited Away," 'Spirited Away': Finally, a film title that speaks the truth
","While I personally have doubts over whether 'Spirited Away' deserved the animated picture Oscar nod over 'Ice Age,' there's definitely no doubt that it's a mesmerizing work in its own right and easily puts the overblown 'Princess Mononoke' to shame. This flawlessly dubbed (courtesy of Pixar, no less) version of Hayao Miyazaki's masterpiece will draw you in and leave you breathless by the time the closing credits roll. From the foreboding environment of a haunted bathhouse and the imagery of twisted characters such as No-Face, Yubaba, and her Andre the Giant-sized offspring, to the heroine Chihiro (voiced brilliantly by 'The Ring's' Daveigh Chase) and her courageous struggle to rescue her captive parents, it's near impossible to find anything here to criticize, but at just over two hours, it runs a tad too long and sometimes suffers from slow pacing. 'Spirited Away' is more captivating than entertaining (which is not necessarily a bad thing), and is one of those rare movies that will stick to the subconscious for a long time. If this is the last anime film I ever see in my lifetime, I'll be more than satisfied. Disney continues to excel with animated films that aren't theirs.  8/10",Null,0,0,31 July 2003
Resident Evil," Resident Dreadful: Appalling video game film as vivacious as a rabbit punch
","Almost a year ago, I compared the two video-game movies 'Tomb Raider' and 'Final Fantasy' to Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston, respectively, because 'Raider' had annihilated 'Fantasy' in the summer box office race.Now the latest to step between the ropes is 'Resident Evil,' also based on a popular game series, and it's easily the Mike Tyson of this genre. You're probably thinking, why? Is it a heavy hitter that boasts a knockout punch? A movie that mows down everything in its path and leaves the audience awed and asking for more? Not even close. Simply put, it's because it bites.What's wrong with this film can be summed up in one word. Everything. 'Resident Evil' is a painful, slow-moving exercise in sheer torment for every single one of its 100 minutes. Never before have I groaned in agony, buried my face in my hands and shook my head in disbelief so often in a single movie. 'Evil' is so horrible, it should be used by police as a confession extractor. There is not one redeeming quality to be found whatsoever.Is it frightening at all? Yes, it will be for those who go into this dreck expecting menial details like a decent story and acting.Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson (not Paul Thomas Anderson of 'Magnolia' fame), spun straw into gold with 'Mortal Kombat,' but doesn't make lightning strike twice as he again eschews a competent script in favor of flashy visuals. In this case, it's gunfire, zombies, short dresses, speech-drowning music, poorly developed characters, bad editing, plus more gunfire and more zombies. 'Evil's' lethargically-paced wreck of a plot is composed of long sequences showing people skulking through quiet, deserted locations, looking alarmed at every little sound, before unleashing loads of ammunition. Then the process is repeated minutes later.'Evil' opens with an explanation of how scientists and workers at an underground laboratory called 'The Hive' are suddenly exposed to deadly chemicals that look like neon mattress springs. This biological disaster has transformed everyone into  surprise!  flesh-eating zombies. (What were you expecting, the Rockettes?) Responsible for this havoc is the Hive's supercomputer, dubbed the 'Red Queen,' who sounds like a high-pitched HAL and is represented visually as a small holographic girl. Don't ask.Enter Alice (Milla Jovovich), an amnesiac since collapsing unconscious in her shower. After changing into a Sturgis chic outfit of a very short red dress and very tall black boots, she spends an eternity investigating a huge mansion before abruptly being captured by a team of soldiers and taken to the Hive, where she's joined by another hostage, Matt (Eric Mabius), plus old flame Spence (James Purefoy) and tough-chick cop Rain (Michelle Rodriguez). As if you couldn't guess already, they combine forces to investigate the Hive and fight off the unimposing zombies, whose extent of a makeup job looks nothing more than having their faces covered in flour with a blood capsule to chew on. (They can also survive as much as five gunshots, yet are instantly dispatched by the undersized fists and feet of the female leads.)The pasty-faced automatons express more excitement than the actors who sleepwalk through their equally lifeless roles. Purefoy is the lone player who isn't a total laughingstock. Mabius is gifted with lines like 'She's right...we're gonna die here,' in between repeatedly shouting the F-word for no reason. As usual, Rodriguez simply overexerts herself: 'After this...I'm gonna go get laid.' Her face is again frozen in her trademark head-down, eyes-up sneer. (Does her head slope downward because her protruding lower lip adds extra weight to it?) Entertainment Weekly recently stated that Jovovich 'could be a knife collection away from becoming the next Angelina Jolie.' It seems they forgot a few things: marketability, athleticism, and charisma. Little details like that. Jovovich doesn't yet have the star power to successfully carry a movie on her own. She sees only a mere thread of action in the whole film, including the much-publicized and dopey sequence in which she battles Dobermans who look like they've been doused in spaghetti sauce. She is stone-faced in a majority of her scenes, and lacks vitality in any physical activity such as firing a gun or fighting off the zombies. When she does emote, it's in a silly moment where she pleads with a wounded soldier who insists on being left behind. Anderson tries to hide the lack of depth in the script by constantly putting characters in compromising positions in order to utilize the ever-predictable jump-scare tactic. They're always reaching a hand out conveniently close to something that, in turn, you know will suddenly grab them. Plot expositions suddenly pop out of the blue, courtesy of cumbersome flashback sequences as Alice gradually regains her memory. Considering its intense buildup, the monster known as 'The Licker' has no impact on the film at all. And on a local note, what was up with the San Francisco backdrop if the film takes place in (fictitious) Raccoon City?The worst part of 'Evil' is courtesy of editor Alexander Berner. After a despondent scene where Alice and Spence hover pensively over the body of a main character's relative for several minutes in an empty office, the very next shot is a jump cut of them frantically running for their lives in a totally different location before pushing through a door and slamming it shut. I sat aghast as I wondered how the director could be so blind to allow such an ugly transition to get into the final print. Capping off this unabashed embarrassment is a miserable ending so obvious in touting  God help us  a sequel, that it might as well have been announced in huge letters on the screen. Listen up. There is an outstanding movie called 'Tomb Raider.' Buy it. It has a plot. It has a script. It has exhilarating characters. It has a brain. It was the best film of 2001. And it is more than light years ahead of this apathetic mess. To call 'Resident Evil' a better film in any regard is sacrilegious. It's like saying the Cowsills are a better rock group than the Beatles. Keep your distance unless you are willing to sit and be tortured into submission for an hour and a half. I have spoken and you have been warned. 1/10",1,4,8,21 March 2002
Men in Black II," Rushed and uninvolving plot disrupts Smith and Jones' chemistry in 'MIB' sequel
","This sequel that was five years in the making again stars Will Smith as Agent J, who, after losing his new partner, Agent T (Patrick Warburton), looks up Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), now working at a post office with no remembrance of his alien-fighting past. On the lam is a pizza deliveryman-eating seductress disguised as a Victoria's Secret model (Lara Flynn Boyle), plus her two-headed cohort (Johnny  Knoxville). It's believed that the cosmic beauty possibly has a checkered past involving K and J's new crush, Laura (Rosario Dawson). Due to its short running time (a lean 88 minutes), 'MIB II' is  uninvolving and badly rushed. There's no time for essentials such as character development because it was apparently more important to have Frank the Pug (voiced by Tim Blaney) upstage nearly the entire cast, though he does provide some of the film's few laughs courtesy of a humorous rendition of Gloria Gaynor's 'I Will Survive.' But aside from that, there is none of the spontaneous humor from the first film, such as Smith's hilarious entry-exam scene. Director Barry Sonnenfeld once again makes a cameo appearance, as does Michael Jackson (yes, the Michael Jackson) in a pointless bit part. Smith hams up his role by bouncing around the screen like a kid in need of Ritalin. He and Jones, as usual, have great chemistry on screen and complement each other well, which is quite possibly the only saving grace of an otherwise average flick. 'MIB II' warrants watching just for the humorous sight of Jones in a U.S. Postal Service uniform.  7/10",Null,0,0,27 September 2002
From Hell," Though slightly sleepy and hollow at times, 'From Hell' is a slice of movie heaven
","You may have noticed that I've played the comparison game a lot in 2001.While it's had its benefits, it's also resulted in my watching of failures such as 'Final Fantasy' and 'Shrek' (yes, I considered 'Shrek' a disappointment), in order to compare them to the likes of the far superior 'Tomb Raider' (which I wanted to compare to 1995's 'Mortal Kombat') and 'Chicken Run,' respectively.It may sound unfair, but at the same time it's led me to watch movies that I originally wouldn't have plunked the money down for in the first place.'From Hell' is no exception. I first heard of it after reading an article i n a British film magazine, of all places. The plot, characters and setting quickly had me believing that this was going to be 'Sleepy Hollow Redux,' which is never a bad thing.As with the aforementioned 1999 Tim Burton masterpiece, Johnny Depp plays a Brit-accented police detective who tries to solve a series of grisly murders. Whereas 'Sleepy Hollow' retells the legend of the Headless Horseman, 'From Hell,' directed by the Hughes Brothers, does likewise with the legend of Jack The Ripper, who, unfortunately, was never apprehended for his crimes.However, that's where the similarities end.While 'From Hell' is by no means a letdown, I found that 'Tomb Raider' had more in common with 'Sleepy Hollow' than this did, but that's another story. It doesn't mean, though, that it's not entertaining. And yes, it has an engaging plot, though I had to see the film twice to fully get the gist of it.As always, the ever-versatile Depp steals the show. He stars as Fred Abberline, a drug-addicted inspector who sees visions of brutally murdered women in his narcotic-hazed dreams that ultimately come true. One thing leads to another and he is soon saddled with a serial murder case in which a group of gravely down-and-out prostitutes inhabiting London's sleazy, unpleasant Whitechapel District circa 1888 are being murdered one by one by a killer who is bedecked in a top hat and billowing cape and whom the public has nicknamed Jack The Ripper. He then takes his madness a step further and removes his victims' organs postmortem.To put it bluntly, this ain't Mary Poppins, folks. There are no homogenized visions of merry old England to be found here.Heather Graham plays alongside Depp as Mary Kelly, one of the circle of dirt-poor hookers who, while not being slaughtered, are constantly harassed and hounded by a seedy gang  call them Victorian-age pimps, if you will  for whatever small change they can scrounge up.The killer's 'surgeries' cause Abberline to seek help from Dr. William Gull (Ian Holm), who just happens to be the physician to the royal family (and who has developed a skin-crawling medical treatment known as a `prefrontal lobotomy'). Their partnership ultimately reveals an exciting twist in the plot.Ian Richardson is effective as Abberline's pompous, anti-Semitic superior (he immediately believes a Jew is responsible for the killings), as is Robbie Coltrane as the inspector's sidekick, confidante and sounding board.I'm always in the mood for a good murder mystery film, and 'From Hell' fits the bill nicely. I liked how little clues were peppered around the crime scenes, ranging from how the hookers' throats were slashed ('The cut goes from left to right; the killer is right handed,' Dr. Gull surmises early on), to Abberline finding an empty sprig of grapes and detecting the scent of a potent alcoholic drink laced with laudanum on the victims' breaths.Plot and acting aside, the real standout of the film is Martin Childs' production design. The backgrounds and sets are so believable that one would never guess that the film was entirely shot in the Czech Republic, which it indeed was. The cinematography by Peter Deming brings viewers up close and personal to the action; it's almost as if you're part of the movie yourself as the characters stroll through Buckingham Palace or a dark alley. The exterior master shots of London are so beautiful that they look more like paintings borrowed from an art gallery.There are no real negatives about this film; my only gripes were that the scenes involving Dr. Gull's medical procedures and John Merrick (the Elephant Man) served only to shock the audience and did little to advance the plot, and it also seemed rather odd that Jack The Ripper would have a partner in crime (a nervous, bottle-swigging carriage driver played by Jason Flemyng), which, as a result, doesn't make him as imposing as he should have been. The flow of the movie is distracted in the third act when another woman, passed off as a French friend of one of the prostitutes, is suddenly thrown into the pot from out of nowhere for no known reason other than to apparently add to the body count.Yes, the term has become cliché, but 'From Hell' is definitely not for the faint of heart. While the blood and gore is censored to some extent in the first act, more full-bleed (no pun intended) shots of the carnage are seen as the film progresses, and everything goes whole hog in the ending.What attracted the brothers Hughes to this film was the opportunity to make a period movie about street violence (a genre that hasn't been beaten to death enough already), which is a thin motive in itself. While it's not groundbreaking for the genre by any means - it lacks what made 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'Seven' so spellbinding  it holds its own, though my mother noted that it was like watching 'Murder By Decree' all over again.All comparisons aside, 'From Hell' is a nice, if sometimes grisly, little piece of cinematic heaven. 8/10",8,10,23,12 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Artistic, haunting, awe-inspiring, and yet so ludicrously criticized
","This rich adaptation of the first of J.K. Rowling's bestselling novels, about Harry Potter's adventures during his first year at Hogwarts, gets the budding franchise off to one hell of a start and myself finally into the thick of Pottermania after I watched the DVD and raced through all four books last summer. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) become so immersed in their roles, we have to remind ourselves that we're watching actors. The same goes for all the supporting characters, who are too numerous to mention here, because it's impossible to single out only a select few. There's not one bad performance to be seen. Complementing the players are solid direction by Chris Columbus, incredible sets by Stuart Craig and a powerful soundtrack by John Williams. When you think about it, has the man ever really composed a bad score? HP's only flaws are a long introduction and slow second-half pacing. Were it not for the awesome 'Tomb Raider,' the boy wizard would have conjured up the best movie of 2001. Yes, you read that right.The last thing I want to do here is get on my soapbox, but there is one issue regarding this movie that I need to get off my chest. While 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' may not have won any Oscars, it unfortunately does deserve the Complaining About the Color of the Couch Award. (Note the initials.) Never mind that HP earned nearly $1 billion worldwide and is the second-highest grossing film of all time (unfortunately playing second fiddle to the downright horrible 'Titanic'). I don't think I've ever heard so much anally-retentive griping before over one single movie. For instance, considering the universal disdain for tie-in merchandising, Columbus caught holy hell for staunchly rejecting any Harry Potter fast-food tie-ins - at Rowling's request, no less! - while Burger King got away unscathed with their 'Lord of the Rings' promotion. Go figure.
And to those who just can't enjoy this great work for what it is, and who instead choose to incessantly take apart every little detail, ranging from the acting and direction to the script's excessive - or dearth of - fidelity to the story and other pointless minutiae, try removing your head from your posterior and maybe you'll get a better view of things. These are the same clods who are so full of themselves that some feel the need to list book mistakes on their two-bit websites, as if they believe that doing so will elevate them to a special plateau. While we're on the subject of fidelity, what the hell does 'overfaithfulness' to the story mean, anyway? 9/10",9,0,0,16 April 2003
Ice Age," Heartwarming, comical 'Ice' is one for the ages
","'Ice Age,' which could have been alternatively titled 'Three Mammals and a Baby,' is the smartest and most entertaining animated movie since 2000's 'Chicken Run.' It's an intellectual winner that will prove gratifying for both children and adults, and it's the first great film of a year otherwise marred by rubbish like 'All About the Benjamins' and 'Resident Evil.' There's just something about small-studio-produced, anthropomorphized animals that does the trick every time.Then again, considering my name, I probably would've been hard-pressed to dislike this movie in the first place.Manfred, a huge, aloof woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), is clearly uninterested in tagging along with an assembly of prehistoric creatures who are migrating south to escape the oncoming Ice Age. Before he knows it, he is thrust into an unexpected and unwelcome position of playing bodyguard to a good-natured yet incompetent sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), when the latter angers a pair of rhinos after inadvertently ruining their dinner in a most unpleasant manner. Meanwhile, Diego (Denis Leary), a revenge-minded sabertooth tiger, has the task of kidnapping a human baby from a tribe who have killed and reduced his pack to the brink of extinction, but his plan of attack fails and the baby disappears from the fracas. Later, Manfred and Sid are shocked to see this little pink thing wash up at their feet on a riverbank, still alive. Though distrustful of one another, the threesome reluctantly put their agendas aside and join forces in order to try to return the child to his family. It's a race against time as they try to succeed in their quest before the Ice Age destroys them all.
Considering that this is a computer-generated film, there's no element of surprise in the animation. But 'Ice Age,' directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, has something that sets it apart from its brethren. It's oddly reminiscent of the immortal Looney Tunes cartoons, due to its old-school slapstick. Throughout the picture, a feisty little critter named Scrat (so called because he's part squirrel and part rat) tries constantly in vain to bury his beloved acorn. His first attempt - pounding it into solid ice - sets off one heck of an avalanche. Scrat's continuous failed attempts to bury that darned acorn resemble Wile E. Coyote's vain pursuits of the Roadrunner. The aforementioned avalanche scene, in which two icy mountain ranges collide with each other and nearly crush our diminutive protagonist, is a blast. The resulting 'uh-oh' expression on his little face, upon realizing his grave mistake, is priceless; you almost expect him to whip out that tiny umbrella and cower beneath it. (He also features in a hilarious tag scene at the film's conclusion.) When characters go flying into a snowbank, they leave their silhouette-shaped imprints in their wake. Diego and Manfred continuously knock Sid on the noggin simply for the baby's amusement. 'Ice Age' even contains a unique and spectacular take on the chase scene, courtesy of what looks like a frozen waterslide hidden deep in a cave.As was the case with 'Chicken Run,' this film's centerpiece is its superb voice acting. With a trio of venerable comedians cast in the leading roles, the chance was there for them to ham it up and try to outdo each other. Instead, their performances are considerably restrained and they mesh together well, resulting in near-impeccable comic timing. Romano brings the right touch of endearing grouchiness as Manfred, but without becoming a completely miserable sourpuss. Leguizamo's high-pitched voice, coupled with a Cindy Brady-type lisp, is perfect for the cowardly and lovable Sid, while Leary, one of the greatest - and most ribald - stand-up comics ever, is all easygoing attitude as shady Diego, who may or may not have something to hide. Their voices fit the characters in the tradition of Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny or Elmer Fudd; it's hard to imagine anyone else in these roles.It doesn't hurt that their bestial counterparts are so darn cute and well developed either. Sure, Diego's mission is to abduct the baby and bring him to the leader of his pack (voiced by Goran Visnjic), but viewers will discover that it's near impossible to feel any animosity towards him. His character is hurt slightly by predictability, but that doesn't make him any less enjoyable. Manfred is pretty much a Neanderthal Lou Grant in terms of his take on the familiar surly-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside disposition, but he doesn't whine constantly about it. He doesn't expect anyone's sympathy. The oddly proportioned Sid steals the show, from his funny backside-swinging strut to his personality as a timid little sloth with a heart of gold; no one is more dedicated to returning the baby safely back to his home. There is a hysterical scene where poor Sid sits in the pouring rain while trying futilely to build a fire, or when he entertains some girlfriends in a prehistoric Jacuzzi (in this case, a tar pit). But while 'Ice Age' succeeds at tickling the funny bone, it's not all mindless fun and games. There is one emotional moment when our three heroes look at a series of cave paintings, including one featuring a mammoth family - mother, father, and child - which transforms into a beautifully animated yet melancholy sequence showing a horrible human slaughter of the family, as seen through Manfred's perspective. He feels a spiritual connection to the baby after the death of his own. Not since Gandalf's demise in 'Lord of the Rings' have I teared up during a movie, which, needless to say, is something I don't do very often. It's a rarity when a film causes viewers to believably experience different emotions without feeling forced to do so.'Ice Age' succeeds in various ways where 'Shrek,' to which it has drawn many comparisons to, fails. How remarkable is this film? It may mark the first time that the toilet humor contains actual humor. The stiff partnership between Manfred and Sid is parallel to the relationship between Shrek and Donkey, only it's much more amusing. There's no juvenile or crude humor, nor are there any unnecessary potshots aimed at its competition or hypocritical morals preached to the audience, such as the rampant don't-judge-someone-until-you-know-them ethics in 'Shrek' that were wedged in between the short jokes. The film's only real weakness is an insignificant sequence involving an army of dodo birds, but it's no more abhorrent than watching frogs and snakes being grossly inflated into balloon animals. And, there are no bloody 'Matrix' spoofs to be seen anywhere.After a string of disappointments like 'Anastasia' and 'Titan A.E.,' Fox's beleaguered animation department has finally broken the jinx with this comic delight, and you can do likewise with 'Ice Age' if you've already lost hope for the 2002 movie season. 9/10",10,1,3,2 April 2002
Shrek," Hypocritical 'Shrek' is too caught up in its own arrogance to be thoroughly entertaining fare
","I've never been a fan of computer-generated films (i.e. the Toy Story series), because, to put it bluntly, it lacks any semblance of soul, as opposed to traditional hand-drawn or stop-motion animation.
Then again, I may be biased; I saw 'Chicken Run,' one of the best animated films ever made, 31 times in the theater and it was worth every cent.
Still, there's a difference between the painstaking, repetitive process of drawing frames or moving stop-motion puppets in such minute increments and instead just sitting and clicking a mouse, letting the computer do 99% of the work.No matter how you look at it, though, what really matters in the end is the color green. Both movies turned huge profits for DreamWorks, grossing over $350 million combined in the U.S. and making Jeff Katzenberg look pretty darned smart for bidding adieu to Disney years ago.But, in this reviewer's opinion, 'Shrek' doesn't hold a candle to CR in terms of story and characterization. No doubt the graphics are terrific, but it doesn't make up for the surprisingly weak plot.Visually, it's very stimulating, with an abundance of brilliant colors in every frame; nothing ever looks pasty or parched. The impromptu romance between a huge, lovesick dragon and the wiseacre Donkey, who is easily the film's greatest asset despite his lack of laughs ('Shrek! I'm lookin' down!' and 'I'm makin' waffles!' are some of his best lines), makes for a humorous subplot.However, the story of our heroes, Shrek and his sidekick donkey  simply known as, well, Donkey  attempting to rescue Princess Fiona from the dastardly Lord Farquaad in an attempt to rid Shrek's homeland of exiled fairytale characters, quickly becomes an afterthought in favor of potshots, self-indulgence and, at times, just plain mean-spiritedness.'Shrek' rips off so many sources of modern pop culture that it would make Puff Daddy proud. For a film that is supposedly set in a Dark Ages-like era, it's an anachronistic paradise.It's not so much the ripping off that is bad, though; it just seemed that no attempts were exerted in making any of it look somewhat original.
Mike Myers brings his Scottish accent out of mothballs (temporarily retired following the terrible 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me') for the portly, self-centered, Lou Grant-like reclusive ogre, who is now the most famous green creature to hit the big screen since Kermit the Frog and who has a weird penchant for eyeball dinners and outhouses.
That's right, the latter opens up the door for the usual bodily function jokes. And apparently the filmmakers couldn't wait to get at it; the first comes during the opening credits. (Side note: It's not smart to include the voice cast in the opening credits either  this goes for any animated picture.) Things certainly do not get off to a good start when we are also subjected to Smash Mouth's 'All Star' for the zillionth time, but I digress.John Lithgow gives a lively, spirited, and sometimes demonic performance as theer, short-tempered, tyrannical Farquaad, a creep I wouldn't want as my next-door neighbor anytime soon. You listen to that moniker enough times and it begins to sound like a certain four-letter word, considering that this movie is pretty much aimed at the kiddies. Just don't ask the young uns to try and pronounce it afterwards. His character is peppered with familiar yet effective 'short' gags.Eddie Murphy runs roughshod as the wisecracking Donkey, and perhaps like Robin Williams, you get the feeling that, sometime during production, Murphy was allowed to insert some of his own frenetic, unrestrained material into the script. Sometimes it works, particularly when he's sweet-talking the fearsome dragon, but most of the time it doesn't. (It also permitted a few inevitable 'ass' jokes to worm their way into the dialogue as well.) You may be tempted to call me a sourpuss, but he scarcely got a laugh out of me during the course of the picture.Little needs to be said about Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), whose only purpose was seemingly just to engage in a forced romance and a 'Three's Company'-type misunderstanding with our hero, and for the film to include yet another damned spoof of 'The Matrix,' a gag that is now as old as used toilet paper. This all leads up to a predictable ending that could be seen from a country mile away.By the way, from here on out, anyone who spoofs 'The Matrix' in any way, shape or form for the sake of a cheap laugh should have their eyebrows removed with Krazy Glue.We also must endure five minutes of tiresome WWF-style antics as Shrek takes out an army of knights in a wrestling ring, which he caps off with a Hulk Hogan-style posedown.But that is all small potatoes compared to what is perhaps the true motive behind this film. It's a shame that Katzenberg chose to turn it into one big piece of anti-Disney propaganda, clearly visible in such scenes as Farquaad's spacious theme park, complete with singing merchandise stands and big-headed mascots, among other things. On the side, it beats the 'don't judge a book by its cover' moral over our heads with the subtlety of a lead pipe. 'Beauty and the Beast,' anyone?Much to no one's surprise, 'Shrek' easily made a killing at the box office. Despite its success, however, this film could easily have been a whole lot more, but it's sacrificed in favor of its misguided holier-than-thou opinion of itself. If you want a genuinely enjoyable animated picture with a superior plot, I highly suggest 'Chicken Run' instead.But if Katzenberg's ludicrous goal was simply to stick it to the House of Mouse, it comes off as hypocritical, since 'Shrek' goes through all the arduous trouble of borrowing extensively from the competition's product in the first place in a flimsy attempt at sculpting its own commodity. 7/10",6,1,1,24 August 2001
Any Given Sunday," Even Al Pacino couldn't save this muddled stereotypical mess
","I had high hopes for 'Any Given Sunday' because I am a fan of (some) sports movies, the cast looked decent, plus Pacino took my breath away in 'The Insider.'Talk about a major letdown.ASG starts off well with fast-paced football action and great cinematography. Dennis Quaid had me squirming in my seat as the injured quarterback. But then it all goes downhill from there.With a dour plot, an array of unlikable, stereotyped characters, silly nudity/sex scenes (I nearly threw up my popcorn during one locker room scene), lousy music (how was DMX's song relevant to a game in any way?), the usual amount of misogyny expected in a film of this genre, use of the 'F' word every two minutes (never mind that some couple two rows down from me was irresponsible enough to bring their 3-year old with them), cliches galore, a totally predictable ending, and the dizzying shots during the games (I guess Salvatore Totino thought this style would be exciting throughout the entire film, but it made me nauseous about halfway through), you can't help but have such a muddled, confusing  work.  At times the football games looked more like music videos rather than actual contests.All that was left was a car chase to make this mess complete. There were times where I swore I was watching a Jerry Bruckheimer testosterone fest.I would also like to know: what did the co-ed football game on the beach and #69's thankfully brief home scene with his two pit bulls have to do with the plot? It's also little things like that which sent this film swirling down the toilet.What in God's name was up with those fake league and team logos??  They all looked like 5th-grade entries in a 'Draw Your Own Logo' contest.  Utterly pathetic (especially the Dallas Knights' unies). The team names were equally bad.  Plus, what did the NFL-wannabe league's initials stand for? I won't comment on the cheesy TV on-screen graphics either.The Dallas Knights' stadium looked so unrealistic, it resembled something out of arena football rather than the NFL, not to mention that no NFL team would have all that psychedelic red and yellow mess on the 50-yard line. It reminded me of  'Forget Paris,' where all the NBA games - with all different teams - were shot in just one arena, thus giving the atmosphere an artificial look. I particularly had a hard time believing that Pacino's team was from Miami. (Oh, by the way, during the Sharks/Knights game you'll see a brief reversed-negative shot of Quaid standing on the sidelines. Oops!)There were a handful of roles that could have been omitted and nobody would've noticed: Lawrence Taylor as 'Shark' (why does he have a nickname that matches the team name? That's like nicknaming Brad Johnson 'Redskin'), Jim Brown as the fascist assistant coach, John McGinley as the sleazy sportswriter, Ann-Margret as the team owner's mother (what a waste of talent), and especially Andrew Bryniarski - who never met a 1-dimensional role he didn't like - as #69, who looked like a combination of Zangief from 'Street Fighter' and the big Nazi from 'Higher Learning,' two equally forgettable roles of his in two equally forgettable films. Can't believe he actually got paid to play this boorish redneck.This movie was not a total loss; I thought there were some good parts, particularly with Jamie Foxx and, surprisingly, Cameron Diaz (was her role somewhat of a dig at Georgia Frontiere? Something to think about), plus a funny scene during the ending credits, but they were shot down by pretty much everything else. The film is way too long, probably by about 45 minutes, and as a result some scenes dragged horribly (especially those annoying flashbacks). Overall, if you want to see a terrific football movie, check out 'North Dallas Forty' or watch an actual game rather than waste $8 on this. Also, it's hard to respect a fictional football league that includes a team called the Houston 'Cattlemen' (I'm not making this up).Even with Al Pacino's presence, 'Sunday' is a turnover on the fourth down. 5/10",5,0,0,20 January 2000
