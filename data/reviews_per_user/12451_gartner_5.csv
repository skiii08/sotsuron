The Blair Witch Project," Interesting concept; but not nearly up to the hype
","I just saw the Blair Witch Project and must say that I was disappointed.My real disappointment is that I went into the film just hoping to be scared out of my wits. I found myself on the edge of my seat waiting for the moment when I would be so overtaken with fright that my stomach wouldn't be able to take it. That moment never came. Were there moments of great tension? Yes. Were some of the events in the film freaky? Certainly. Was it the greatest horror movie ever? Hardly.It was a very interesting concept, but in the end the most scary part of the film is that I found myself driving home woozy from the scattershot home video style.I would not advise anyone not to see the Blair Witch Project, but I would warn not to expect too much.",4,0,1,7 August 1999
X-Men," For a summer blockbuster, X-men is a nice little movie
","If I could describe 'X-men' in one word I would call it 'surprising'. Having gotten used to the overblown and bloated 'Batman' films, I was expecting another bombastic, pointless, neon filled, superhero movie replete with dumb illogical villains and heroes who are seemingly an afterthought in the plot.
Well what do you know?For an expected 'summer blockbuster', X-men is a nice little movie. Fans of the X-men comic are treated to a remarkably faithful adaptation of the characters they know and love. The casual movie goer is treated to a summer movie that has an easy to understand and not needlessly convoluted plot, good but not over the top action, and no mindless smirking quipster villains to groan at.The villain, Magneto, is very essential to the plot, but is not made the core of the film as the Joker was (successfully) in the original Batman movie and the likes of Catwoman, Riddler, and Mr. Freeze were in the subsequent (not so successful) sequels. Even better, the supporting villains are just that; supporting. It is obvious that Magneto is the main man and he does not compete for screen time with his henchmen. It is also an extra bonus, that Magneto is played as an intelligent villain with purpose and not just some loony guy in a colorful suit.   The film is filled with special effects, but does not depend on them to carry the proceedings. The special effects are necessary to the plot and are never overused (they may even be underused, but read on).The only complaint would be that the story really centers on two main characters (Wolverine and Rogue) and to a great degree the other characters (though perfectly cast) are defined but not truly developed. Also at an extremely manageable hour and a half running time, you leave the theater thinking the film could have benefited from another 10 to 15 minutes to come to a satisfactory conclusion (the ultimate final battle is a bit anti-climatic.) Somehow Xmen seems to conclude with a whimper and not a bang. Still I'd rather leave a film being pleased but wanting more than feeling like I just threw my money down the drain. I hope all the stars are signed to a multiple movie deal, because I look forward to a sequel.
Kudos to Fox for putting a superhero movie together that does not play for laughs or cornball antics but instead attempts to find a way to take the essence of their subject (which makes them successful in their own genre) and communicate it on the big screen for the mainstream audience. I can only hope that this message resonates with the non-comic book based audience and X-men brings the super hero genre back from it's current doldrums. Who knows? If X-men is a hit, we just might get a Batman film with a decent plot that is ABOUT Batman someday soon.",7,0,0,16 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," Great first half---weak conclusion
","I don't think there are many spoilers here, but read at your own risk. If you have even seen a trailer or skimmed a review, you know what 'Being John Malkovich' is about. The irony of 'Being John Malkovich' is that once the characters begin actually being John Malkovich, the film seems to stop being interesting.Being an admirer of Malkovich as an actor and being that I had skimmed so many glowing reviews of the film (it was on many top ten lists and was a 4 star film in many circles), I really wanted to like this movie alot before I ever saw it. I also wanted to find a way to justify liking the film more than I did once it was over, but the truth is I was disappointed.The set up of an out of work puppeteer (who only seems to come alive when commandeering one of his marionettes) eventually happening upon a indefinable job for a vague company on the 7 1/2 floor was odd but in an interesting kind of way. Then the portal into Malkovich's mind is unearthed. This seemed like a promising development, but it really falls flat in my opinion.In no time, people are lining up to be in Malkovich's head, but it is not clear why. No one who enters the vehicle of Malkovich's being does anything remotely interesting with their opportunity, not even John Cusack's puppeteer. The puppeteer really does nothing inspired at all, given the ultimate marionette (a living, breathing human being) as his plaything. As character upon character used Malkovich to try to 'bed' each other, I began wishing for Mr. Malkovich to realize what was going on and react to it, but even this action has no payoff. Malkovich's realization results in a strangely amusing scene in which the actor enters the portal himself, but ultimately he never really tries to fight for possession of his 'self'. If he does, we don't see most of it, which is a shame because THAT would have been interesting to watch. 'Being John Malkovich' begins with an ingenious, original distortion ofreality and offers the promise of a strong second half about the importance of self. In the end however, it boils down to many unlikeable characters attempting to achieve their selfish uninteresting goals in life (both current and eternal)through another person (who happens to be John Malkovich, but really could have been anyone for the purposes of the film).The film never ceases being unique, but it ceases being entertaining. 6 out of 10.",6,2,4,10 March 2001
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Movie looks great , but Wonka is a dud.
","I've seen both and have a soft spot for the original admittedly. I have no knowledge of the book so I can't speak to what is more faithful,etc... All I know is I tried to go into the new take with an open mind. I liked many aspects of the new version better than the original, (the flow of the story, the more three dimensional portrayal of Charlie and his family, no dreadful 'Cheer up Charlie' musical interludes) but I felt the Depp Wonka lacked the twisted humor and mystery of Wilder's Wonka. Wilder's Wonka was strange, offbeat, and bizarre but, in the grand scheme of things, with a purpose. The Burton/Depp Wonka is strange, offbeat (but more in an uncomfortable not particularly funny way),weird, and emotionally stunted man. Not much to wonder to him. For all I know, the new take on Wonka is more in line with the character in the book and I can appreciate the attempt at a different direction; it just didn't work for me. I'm glad I saw the new version, but I was not all that satisfied. Just one man's opinion.",6,0,1,2 January 2006
Fantastic Four," underwhelming..... some spoilers
","the effects are just fine and do the Fantastic Four justice, the rest of the film is not up to the task.With the exception of Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm, the characters are largely uninteresting mainly due to an inferior plot which gives the Fantastic Four little to do other than mope, engage in tepid love triangles (ok Doom's a jerk but what does Sue see in Reed?), and trust the bad guy for no reason. Which bring us to the most disappointing aspect; the 'villain'. Dr Doom, though played fine enough by Julian McMahon, (who is well seasoned at playing a soul-less cad on Nip/Tuck) is given little purpose other than he is just a bad guy at heart. As played in the movie, Dr Doom presents a threat specifically and personally to the Fantastic Four and no one else, which really undermines the villain's effectiveness. What is so 'fantastic' if the superhero group is not saving the city if not the world or doing something that matters other than saving themselves? Fantastic four is OK, I would not advise not seeing it but I would suggest to temper your expectations. If you want to see a good movie based on a comic book, go see Batman Begins",4,5,10,7 July 2005
