Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," By far the best movie of 1999
","Right well I am a big fan of Star Wars as are most people I know, of all ages.  There is only one point I can critise the film on and that is the ages Anakin and Princess Amidala are supposed to be, and how old they actually look.  The fact that in the next sequel they are to get together does seem rather stupid, but a lot of people don't agree with me on this. Other than that fact, the rest of the film is great, the musical score, the special effects and computer graphics.  The transporters with all the droids are brilliantly shown and the underwater scenes look amazing.  People that don't rate this film much are just sad and can't see the humour, fun and simplicity of the story, this movie is there to be enjoyed and seen as an escape from reality.",Null,0,0,1 February 2001
Gladiator," Absolutely brilliant movie!!!!
","For the people who say this film was not as good as hyped, or was not entertaining, i think you are totally wrong.  This film was brilliant and is the best movie of the year.  The camera work, script and storyline were absolutly perfect and although the history wasn't exact you don't go to the cinema to watch a documentary.",Null,0,1,1 February 2001
