Ghost," The perfect movie !!!
","I have watched lots of movies from every type and category - from horror to romance. And, at least for me, I can truly say that this is the perfect movie. This movie is the most complete movie I ever watched: it has a true and powerful romance story that is perfectly combine with a thriller, horror, sf, comedy layers. So indeed it is a complete movie. The acting is impressive and the 2 main characters played by Demi and Patrick are perfectly played and really convincing in the way they portray the roles. I really enjoyed the movie and I saw it for more than 10 times because it really makes me fell well. I would recommend it to any one who wants to fell something while watching a movie.",10,3,5,5 December 2011
