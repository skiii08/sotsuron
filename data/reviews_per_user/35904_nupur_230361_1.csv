Sucker Punch," Those criticizing never saw it in the first place
","I have seen many reviews here which say that this movie is a mindless joyride of CG action and scanty clad gals with no material in it.But beneath all the action and mindless killings, have you actually seen the story? Yes, I do agree that the screenplay can be summed up in a one-liner, but the way it has been presented with a fusion of real and imaginary worlds, culminating to a very well summed up ending, makes it worthwhile to have a second look, whilst trying to explore what it all had to offer. Special mention of equally applaud-worthy soundtrack (''Where is my mind' in particular, because of its use at right places in the movie).You may say it's another adaptation of the 'Invincible' kind of story narration genre, but the similarities end just at the level of imagination. Many say the chicks presented looked whorish, but hey, that was the need of the story (the asylum being depicted as a brothel in another world as seen by Baby Doll), the same goes with the action scenes. And just for the hell of it all, it looked awesome with the stunning action visuals nevertheless.Snyder's movies are never appreciated in the first screening. It takes time to look at the story behind the action which he emphasize more on. But given his style of film-making, you can say that he's a Quentin Tarantino of his own kind. His style may not appeal to the masses, but it sure is different in its own way.My advice to those who have rated this movie as just another mindless passable action flick ? Go watch it again, only this time, don't think about the action, go beyond it to explore what it says 'You have all the weapons you need....Now fight ! ' .",8,4,7,17 April 2011
