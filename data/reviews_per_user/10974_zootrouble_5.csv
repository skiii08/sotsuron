Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," It was decent
","Every generation has its idiots--ten years ago it was Beavis and Butthead, twenty it was perhaps lenny and squiggy. This film is not Monty Python, nor is it the simpsons. Borat is not deep (although it claims to be), nor is it subtle. In fact, the comedy is quite obvious.The film claims to reveal the ignorance of the average person by portraying foreigners as a total idiot--anyone who believes foreigners could be so stupid thus ends up looking like an idiot themselves. however, there are not only foreigners this stupid, there are plenty of domestics (wherever you may be from) who are stupid. Therefore, you can't really laugh so much when watching this film at anything other than the sheer insanity of it.ZooTrouble",8,1,7,14 December 2006
American Psycho," Not sure
","Let me be up front and say I am not sure I understood this film. It appears to be a dual of Taxi Driver, the self-proclaimed elite of this movies conflicts in a strange way with the self-hating Bickle of Scorsese's masterpiece. However, they are both people to be loathed by the common man. The character in the film starts to view himself as Neitzche's superman, I believe. Excess takes him over; the film is purely set in an 80's context for this reason. He is part of the 'Me' generation, but this 'me' leads him to kill. It is only he that matters. But I am puzzled with what led him to be that way. I prefer films that at least make some effort to discuss how a character came to be; rather than just placing an artificial construct in front of the film and expecting us to sympathize. The movie isn't bad per se, but you get the sense that the main character is there just to shock...ZooTrouble",6,0,1,10 December 2006
The Elephant Man," Very emotional
","Nothing could hurt more than watching this deformed man in shock at seeing his own face. Perhaps one of the most gut-wrenching moments in all of cinema. A person, a human being, loathed by society by his outward appearance. He understands why, but never himself sees the reason until later in life.There are some strange things in the film; the beginning of the film depicts an elephant and a woman producing a child. The Elephant man is not easy to look at, either. However, this is such a great story on the human condition; it would be sad to miss it. A simple review cannot explain all that is said with this film. It is true art.ZooTrouble",9,0,0,11 December 2006
Paths of Glory," A masterpiece of Kubrick
","The movie is horrifying in its portrayal of the men ordered to die. As far as I know, this is one of the earliest films to portray war as it actually is, or as I understand it actually is. A true, disgusting, Hell. Men are disposable and there for one purpose, to feed the war machine.What makes this film even more disturbing is that it is based on a true event. The film was actually banned in France for awhile as is my understanding due to the story told. I won't give too many details, but prepare to understand what 'war is Hell' really means.ZooTrouble",10,1,1,12 December 2006
The Great Escape," Not impressed
","But I am not from the generation of this film. People I know who were around when this film was released assure me that McQueen was the epitome of cool. The problem is that 'cool's eternal, but it's always dated.' I can see how he coudl have been viewed as cool, but the story behind the film seems, to me, mediocre at best. The music is well-known and enjoyable, but the story of the film could have been a much deeper statement about the futility of war, and what does it end up being? A place to watch McQueen showboat. My opinions could be totally misplaced here; but I did not see anything spectacular about this film. Stalag-17 seems a much greater film with a similar story.ZooTrouble",6,7,20,10 December 2006
