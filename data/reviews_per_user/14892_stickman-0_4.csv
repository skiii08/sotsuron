The New World," It looked good... maybe TO good...
","this movie has no music and barely any diologue... don't see it. it was one of the worst movies ever. it looked awesome but it was so boring and slow that I skipped through half of it. I skipped 10 minutes only to find out that I didn't miss ANY diologue... nothing was said for 10 minutes now that is sad! please be advised that people that LIKE slow movies (eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, etc) WILL like this movie. but if you're looking for a hardcore swashbuckling swordfighting, action filled movie... than you will absolutely hate this movie. peace out... oh, by the way... if you DO want to see a good action movie... watch mortal kombat. peace",2,1,6,19 July 2006
Iron Man 2," Mindless Fun, but suffers of 'Sequelitis'
","this movie is just... good. Wasn't as good as I thought it would be and it sure as hell isn't as good as the first one but it was FUN and that's all that matters because... you get what you pay for. Just good, mindless fun.Now, I won't give away the ending or anything, but I will say that the plot is much better in the first one which was, to me, one of the better superhero movies made along with 'The Dark Knight' and the R rated modern classic 'Kick-Ass'.' If you have a bit of money and friends that have nothing to do, I highly suggest that you check this out, but when you go in, don't compare it to the first one at all, because it's not worth it, movies are fun, have it.--Alex Parker, film critic Another film to watch is 'Inglourious Basterds' if you haven't seen it yet, but be prepared for subtitles.",3,1,3,12 May 2010
Shrek 2," worst animated film ever made
","this is by far the most f'ed up movie i've ever seen... what entertainment can you get from: hey! it's the godmothers factory! why don't we go in for a spell? what kind of a joke is that whoever watches this movie has problems... I loved Shrek 1 and i'm sure everyone did... this movie is a disgrace to humanity and mike myers. whoever made this movie is someone that is a shoo-in for pictures to go on my dartboard 2/10 (2 for the animation being good)and whoever that hates the movie had better have msn... this movie sucks... even if they DID take 4 years to make the damn thing it still sucks. the jokes are mediocre, animation is OKAY. when they said it was the best movie of the year I took my entire family (7 people) to go see it. it cost $126.37 and I had to pay for it. It wasn't worth a damn crumb of popcorn to watch this movie. I would'nt watch it for 1 million dollars. I hate this movie! don't see it!",8,3,7,19 April 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I have never been so depressed...
","this movie is a @%$#ing rip-off! I fell asleep twice in the movie! the critics are retards to give this movie 4/5 stars! I paid $54.62 to take my friends to see it. we were making fun of this movie all the way 100 kilometers home... 100 dollars in gas! WASTED! if you have not seen this movie, don't. it is boring and queer! I hated this movie not because it had nudity and other crap, but because it was boring, and it must have been inspired by a sleeping pill or some piece of crap... the worst 2 ways to see this movie would be: #1: set a guy/girl night. #2: see it in theaters. I was woken up by my friend brad. I asked him how the movie ended and he said: 'I was woken up by the lights when the movie ended... as you can see this movie is a sure-fire 'skip'...my score: -1000000/5 (its that bad.)",10,5,13,22 April 2006
