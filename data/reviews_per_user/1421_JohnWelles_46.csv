Vertigo," Hitchcock's Greatest Movie.
","'Vertigo' (1958) is my favourite Alfred Hitchock film. Not only is the casting, music, and direction perfect, its also a brilliant, but disturbing look into a mans obsession of a woman. Even if the first part of the film wasn't already excellent, you have Scottie(James Stewart) transforming Judy Barton(Kim Novak) into Madeleine, and his near descent into madness(?). No one but Hitchocock could do it as good as this. An interesting thing to note, is that it was based on a French book by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac called 'D'Entre Les Morts'. These two writers had provided the original novel for Henri-Georges Clouzot's (the French master of suspense) 'Les Diaboliques'. A haunting film that demands multiple viewings.",10,2,7,7 March 2009
The Monuments Men," Missed Opportunity, but Still Entertaining
","'The Monuments Men' (2014), directed by George Clooney, his fifth film behind the camera, makes use of an irresistible premise: recover art works looted by the Nazis during the dying days of World War II. Not only is this a story never told before in the cinema (leading to an aura of uniqueness not often found with Hollywood studio pictures), but Clooney has assembled an enviable cast alongside himself with Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban and Cate Blancett.Yet as a war film about art, it rarely seems too concerned about the specifics of the paintings and sculptures they're trying to rescue. Jan Van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and Michelangelo's 'Madonna and Child' are the main focus of the film, providing a narrative thread for the script (written by Clooney and Grant Heslov), but the thousands upon thousands of other pieces of art (emphasised by frequent shots of warehouses or mines stacked with canvases) are generalised into anonymous cultural property in the need of preservation. It's frustrating, as are many parts of the film.It lacks a strong narrative drive, being, until the last third, very episodic â€“ some are fine, like Murray's and Balaban's encounter with a young German soldier at night, but others, such as discovering barrels of gold teeth taken from Jews exterminated by the Holocaust, show the film's inadequacy dealing with the horrors of war. The pathos of members of the team dying and the mass destruction of art in impromptu bonfires lit by the German army are themes it finds hard enough to grasp and make the audience appreciate their impact. It keeps bumping into these big, important topics, the occupation of France and the role of collaborators say, pursuing them for a little while in subplots before backing away, unsure how to proceed, like over the use of child soldiers by the Germans, which is turned into almost an amusing anecdote.This dichotomy between seriousness and a lighter, caper feel, reminiscent at times of late sixties and early seventies war films (think 'Kelly's Heroes' (1970) and their ilk, a feeling reinforced by Alexandre Desplat's bass-heavy music score) leads to an uneasily balance not solved by Clooney's at times uncertain and uneven direction. It always looks good thanks to cinematographer Phedon Papamichael's eye for framing, but the characters' speeches, justifying the importance of art even during wartime, sits awkwardly with the more cinematic moments, particularly the climactic race against time to liberate a huge storage of art.It remains entertaining and well-acted throughout, but it's clear that this is a film which could have been a more powerful exploration of its subject than it is. A missed opportunity then, enjoyable though, despite its failings.",7,1,3,6 April 2014
3:10 to Yuma," About as Good as a Remake Can Get.
","'3:10 to Yuma' (2007), directed by James Mangold, is a remake of the classic 1957 Western of the same name, made by the under-appreciated Delmar Daves. Mangold crafts a excellent Western, with fine leading performances from Christian Bale (as Dan Evans, played by Van Heflin in the original) and Russel Crowe (as Ben Wade, played by Glenn Ford in the original) and a charismatic turn from Ben Foster (as Charlie Prince). I like how, while being reasonably faithful to its source, they changed some things so as to render it worthwhile and not simply a pointless retelling of the same story. It benefits from nice photography and editing too. I've noticed some complaints about the ending, but I thought that was one of the highlights, with expertly staged action and the climax is refreshingly different from the 1957 film. Not quite as good as the original (no remake can be truly great, I think, because they lack that crucial element of originality), but still very exciting and enjoyable. I heartily recommended it to anyone who likes Westerns well acted and directed.",8,0,0,6 June 2010
Skyfall," Bond as We Know Him, Yet Not Quite.
","'Skyfall', directed by the Oscar–winning Sam Mendes, is the twenty third James Bond film. It's a series that celebrates fifty years of motion picture history, its origins stretch back to the early nineteen-fifties when former spy Ian Fleming penned the first of fourteen Bond novels, 'Casino Royale'. When it was revealed in 1961 that President John F. Kennedy was a huge fan of the novel 'From Russia with Love', 007 became an international success that spawned in the following year the first in the phenomenally popular adaptations for the silver screen: 'Dr. No'.'Skyfall', in many ways, has more in common with these earlier films than the later ones: the Aston Martin DB5 is back (as used in 'Goldfinger' [1964]) as well as the ice cool style of Bond himself.As Bond, Daniel Craig is terrific: debonair, yet tough enough to be believable when he abandons a dying field agent. His performances in 'Casino Royale' (2007) and 'Quantum of Solace' (2009) are built upon to deliver a complex character and not a geriatric punster that Roger Moore was close to creating in his later outings. He brings depth and a steely emotionalism to the role.Javier Bardem as the villain is perhaps the best in years, giving us a complex creation that has a goal so much more interesting than the resolutely generic world domination plans of so many Bond adversaries. The Oscar-winning actor is superb here, his intense performance destined to be regarded as a classic.Judi Dench, another Oscar winner, gives her finest portrayal of 'M'; her prominence and well-written dialogue ensure that she is the real 'Bond-girl'.Others, such as Ben Whishaw, Bérénice Marlohe and Ralph Fiennes are all excellent, making this the finest all-round acted James Bond film ever.However, pride of place for kudos is the Academy Award winning director Sam Mendes who has brought to life a top-flight thriller first and foremost, never overplaying his action scenes. In that respect, one might wonder if Mendes is harking back to the 'New Hollywood' movement of the seventies as well as older, classic Bonds. He is suitably aided by nine time Oscar nominee Roger Deakins doing the cinematography that really gives an assured feel to all of the film's locations, making you feel the cold, wet damp of Scotland, the grey November of London and the gaudy modern cities of Asia.Why this James Bond film is so good is because Mendes has realised that this needs to be a good thriller in the first place, one that works on its own as well as a continuation of the diverse adventures of 007, licensed to kill.",9,3,11,18 November 2012
Casablanca," A Classic of Pure Escapism.
","Michael Curtiz's 'Casablanca' (1942) would be impossible to remake nowadays. Most of the dialogue has passed into the public's conscience, so saying such classic lines like: 'Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' would now be impossible to say with a straight face. What a knack the screenwriters, Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein, had for great dialogue! When seen today, 'Casablanca' still holds a misty awe about it. Wholly studio bound it may be, but would you rather have the sprawling and ugly city it really is? An improbable classic where the (anti?) hero doesn't get the girl in the end, it is a film only Hollywood could make. A joy to behold.",10,2,3,1 September 2009
Gravity," Modern Classic
","'Gravity' (2013), directed by Alfonso Cuarón, is at its heart, a film of survival, of battling an inhospitable environment against all odds, with no help and little chance of success. Framed like this, the film looks less like a science fiction film and more like a tale of survival. Cuarón has endeavoured to make the space environment as realistic as possible, from the interior of space stations to the movement of the human body in zero gravity. Imaginatively utilising 3D, he shoots the many scenes set in the deathly silence of space to simulate the appearance of the camera 'floating'. The audience feels like they too are in the midst of space, buoying alongside Clooney and Bullock. This creates a sense of credibility throughout and makes the peril the characters face even tauter. Cuarón has crafted a milieu that is ideal for showing the fragility of humanity against the vastness of the cosmos; writing the screenplay with his son Jonás, they populate the drama with only two characters to reinforce the emptiness of space.These two characters though, are the audience's anchor, and are refreshingly well-written, recognisably human, reacting to events in a way that conforms to reality. Both Clooney and Bullock are excellent, never letting the extensive CGI dominate, while being appropriately ordinary enough to allow the viewer to identify with them, particularly Bullock. This is crucial for a film that concentrates on so few characters.The cinematography by five time Academy Award nominee Emmanuel Lubezki perhaps acts as another character in the film, being the prism through we which enter the drama. Starting with a bravely held shot of Earth, it permits us to slowly make sense of the conversation over the radio between the astronauts and NASA (represented by an un-seen Ed Harris, one of the stars of 'Apollo 13' [1995]). It continues with an extraordinary, thirteen minute long, continuous shot that is supremely virtuosic, their incredible duration carried on throughout the entire film. Yet this isn't done for its own sake; in doing so, Cuarón brings you into the film and introduces a sense of claustrophobia with people stuck inside their spacesuits and the cramped interiors of escape shuttles and space stations. This had to be worked out in immense detail far in advance of shooting, meaning cinematography and editing (by Cuarón and Mark Sanger) is intimately linked.The music by Steven Price is very good, allowing for silence where there needs to be, and overall this exemplar of pure cinema, with no villain except the harshness of the universe, is probably the best original film of the year. It masterfully builds tension and character simultaneously and remains resolutely human throughout.Hollywood can still surprise.",9,2,5,7 December 2013
Citizen Kane," Fabulous.
","Orson Welles's 'Citizen Kane' (1941) is a masterpiece. Their is no doubt about it. It is one of the few films that are just fabulous in all departments. The plot is about Charles Foster Kane's (Orson Welles) life, as seen through the eyes of many different people who knew him. You hear a lot of people's opinions (his second wife, his personal business manager, his guardian during his childhood...) but never his own. The brilliant twist ending is one of the best I have ever seen. What really imprints itself on the brain is the cinematography. The acting, makeup, direction and screenplay are all fantastic, but the photography (by the great Gregg Toland) is truly the best camera work you are ever likely to see. The deep focus and distinct shadows almost place 'Citizen Kane' in the Film Noir category. A film to watch over and over again.",10,1,4,9 April 2009
World War Z," Hollywood Apocalypse.
","Some films, rather than standout as cohesive, engaging, entertaining works that operate on a consistent, level base, in fact go down a different, more risk taking approach in the hope it will work out. Often due to an assortment of production difficulties, the initially envisioned motion picture turns out to be a completely different final film. Famous examples include Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' (1979), Sam Peckinpah's 'Major Dundee' (1965) and infamously, Michael Cimino's 'Heaven's Gate' (1981), that succeed in putting its studio, United Artists, into bankruptcy. However, conflict doesn't always produce a great film, or even a flawed great movie. Sometimes it just sits on the screen as a catalogue of disaster. If 'World War Z' isn't entirely bad, then perhaps it is a testament to director Marc Forester's ability to marshal his footage and admit that his present ending was no good and proceeded to film a new climax.Throughout the epic-scale film, elements of a smaller, more personal film are ever present: the sight of a cop, facing the breakdown of civilisation, helping himself to food supplies like everyone else; a drunk on the streets of Philadelphia calmly oblivious to the confusion and violence around him. The surreal sight of soldiers in South Korea, in pitch black, driving rain, cycling on small bicycles to avoid attracting the plague-ridden zombies. The implicit point that countries that are prepared for war, like North Korea and Israel, are better organized for cataclysmic disaster. The deathly, eerily unnatural silence of a Welsh village; these details give weight to Forester's direction, as does the impressively mounted small-scale action scenes such as the initial zombie attack in gridlocked Philadelphia traffic. These scenes are the best in the film and help to displace (but not vanquish) the film's many manifest flaws.Brad Pitt has a commendably intense performance and is backed up by a host of small roles from actors such as David Morse, James Badge Dale and Daniella Kertesz who are all very good, yet their effect is diluted by the unfortunately linear, globe-trotting script that suffers from repetition despite a few ingeniously cruel twists of fate. The constant cutbacks to Pitt's family throughout the course of the film help anchor his character, but they're too short to establish their characters as anything but ciphers, a problem for everybody except Pitt.The ending, while fine in isolation, hardly creates a sense of conclusion while the tacked-on coda contains enough hastily sketched information to furnish two more films, leaving the last ten minutes rushed.The lacklustre computer generated imagery for the Jerusalem sequence is only one of the film's problems in a movie that finally, struggles under them, some due to poor scripting and others because of a lack of literal direction. It's hard to be convinced by it and that may well be its greatest failing.",7,0,2,7 August 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Boldly Going Where We've Been Before.
","'Star Trek Into Darkness' (2013), directed by J. J. Abrams, is the second in the rejuvenated Star Trek franchise, following on from the similarly-directed Abrams 2009 entry 'Star Trek'. The decision to start afresh was a wise decision. Paramount Studios allows new audiences to become enticed with a series that was struggling under the weight of continuity and limp direction.However, if Abrams seemed like a gust of fresh air in 2009, in 2013 his approach has been disappointingly safe. Instead of striking out for new ways of dealing with Star Trek, he has here relied too much on the tried and tested. Even the exhilarating opening sequence that encompasses fantastic art direction and costume design is actually reminiscent of one of the opening action scenes from Steven Spielberg's 'Indiana Jones' series. The cinematography too, by Dan Mindel is excellent, the primary colours of the planet and the multitudes of flashing lights in the otherwise stark interior of the U.S.S. Enterprise stands out beautifully. The striking reds and whites of the opening sequence also help make this one of the best looking major studio films of the year so far.Yet Abrams handling of characterisation and dialogue is as assured as ever, revealing his training in American television. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as Captain James T. Kirk and Commander Spock respectively, enjoy an easy chemistry and banter that the rest of the crew, including Simon Pegg as Scotty and Karl Urban as Bones share. It is these character moments, chiefly in the first half of the film, that are the true highlights. Yet the film, like many other Hollywood blockbusters, is scared to be character-led, and opts for a generic revenge plot that tires itself with actions scenes that quickly lose their vitality and excitement.Still, Peter Weller is very good in an underwritten role, as is rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as Harrison.The main problem then, is the script, written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof. Not the dialogue, which builds an engaging repartee, but the plot. Action films build towards a climax through constant reversals of fortunes for the protagonists, but here it is all deplorably linear, subplots done away with presumably by the logic it would complicate the film too much. The opposite effect instead occurring: it becomes very simple and straightforward, there being only one genuinely unexpected revelation, which is too little for a movie over two hours long.Still, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is entertaining, and made with a great deal of professionalism, in particular the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic, and is consistently well-acted and directed. It is just the recurring problem of today's mainstream Hollywood films that most refuse to take chances.",7,4,8,14 June 2013
12 Angry Men," An Absolout Masterpice.
","Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men' (1957) has me laughing out-loud every time I see it. This is not because I dislike the film, but because the director makes it seem so easily done, it makes you think you could do it yourself. The acting is a complete dream. Henry Fonda, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Robert Webber are exceptional. But the real star of the film is Lee J. Cobb. He immense's himself so completely into his role that its hard to believe that the movie isn't a documentary. The ending of the film, with that look on Lee J. Cobb's face is heart rendering. Lumet's directorial debut (he had been previously in TV) is as remarkable as Orson Welle's in 'Citizen Kane'. A brilliant piece of film making.",10,1,1,8 June 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The Screens Blackest Comedy.
","'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is the definitive black comedy. Forget 'The Ladykillers', any film that can joke about complete destruction of the Earth, deserves to be remembered. From Peter Sellers three roles (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley and Dr. Strangelove) and his two classic lines ('Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!' as President Merkin Muffley and 'Mein Führer! I can walk!' as Dr. Strangelove) and George C. Scott as Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson ('I didn't say we wouldn't get our hair mussed, but I do say no more than ten to twenty million people killed'), it dosn't put a foot wrong.",10,1,3,4 March 2009
Alien," Acid Trip
","Alien (1979) is a science fiction classic that is strangely unoriginal. The 'used future' idea that is so central to the movie's success was used before in scriptwriter's Dan O'Bannon's own Dark Star (1974) and in George Lucas' Star Wars and not only that, but the plot is a crossbreeding of The Thing (1951) - the dark prowling search for the monster through underlit corridors - and It! the Terror from Beyond Space - the actual plot of the alien running amok through the spaceship. Having read Dan O'Bannon's original screenplay (with a co-story credit for Ronald Shusett), it's easy to see why studios were reluctant to pick it up: one dimensional characters, a very simple, linear story progression, an alien that looks like a chicken. It is promising script that could turn into a good film. Yet is this hindsight, knowing what would come from it? When Walter Hill's company Brandywine bought it, they immeasurably improved the characters, removed a lot of unnecessary to-ing and fro-ing, crucially added the android Ash to add another layer of complexity to an otherwise too simple story and, at the suggestion of (possibly) Twentieth Century Fox head Alan Ladd Jr., turned Ripley into a woman. O'Bannon provided the bones, Hill along with David Giler, added the meat. However, no script credit for them, due to a series of falling-outs with O'Bannon and the W.G.A. ruling (wrongly in my view) in favour of sole credit for O'Bannon. However, we still have a remarkably derivative script; no magic here.It would take two people to turn a script that was an unapologetic throwback to fifties' monster movies into a classic, for that is what the final film is: Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger. There must have been some nervous studio executives the day Scott agreed to do the film; his only other movies had been 1977's The Duellists: a good period film, uses Harvey Keitel and David Carradine well, but trades too heavily on the tricks of Barry Lyndon. In fact it gives you a pretty good idea of the vices of Scott: too impressed by technique, whereas Stanley Kubrick knew its limits as well as its virtues. Still, Brandywine had been impressed enough when they saw it at Cannes to hire him; they felt his handling of sets was exactly what was needed. He was. Ridley Scott's direction helps turn the film into something mysterious, beautiful, scary: even today, his skill is eye-wateringly impressive. The killing of Brett is an audio and visual sequence that should be taught at film schools: the slowly, delicious building of tension, while (crucially) no music plays: just the sound of dripping water and swaying chains, a sound that would later be utilised for the early promotional trailers. His constantly moving camera up and down the fantastically realised sets of the spaceship Nostromo turns the ship, along with the camera, into another protagonist. Scott had evidently studied Hitchcock well.Giger's involvement though was a make-or-break decision. His art is so sexually disturbing and pushed too far, the film could've become dominated by it. Cleverly, Scott separated his legends of science fiction art design: Ron Cobb, Chris Foss, Moebius, to tackle only the human built aspects: the spaceship and its cargo. Thus, when the Nostromo intrudes into the alien landscape, there is clear difference in the look that could have become blurred if all the designers had worked on everything. Giger tackled only the alien and its environs like the Derelict and the Space Jockey. The Alien, a truly sexual predator, is his piece d'resistance, boldly and brazenly horrifying like no other creature of the night before or since, at least forty percent of the film's success is due to it. The acid blood of the creature underlines too how much of a fantasy it is as it leads to the question, why doesn't its blood burn through its own skin? It's a clue that the film, despite on the surface being a science fiction picture, is in fact really, deep down, a horror film.Another reason the film works as well as it does is because of its canny casting: Sigourney Weaver, strong but vulnerable, a great female role that helps define the film. John Hurt, a last minute replacement for Jon Finch, an unsuspecting victim of oral male rape and the anchor to the still wince-inducing chestburster scene. Together with Ian Holm, Tom Skerrit, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright and the great Yaphette Koto, a crew is created and characterised so you know and care about them before the killing starts.Alien is a Freudian bisexual horror in that both male and female characters are raped and are equally dealt with by the alien; is this seventies feminism, with a female lead who is treated in a non-sexist way by her compatriots, taken a step further? Or is a cautionary parable about the future and an early warning against corporatism that would become so much part of the cinematic landscape in the eighties? So many different readings, but Scott concentrates on the most interesting: our darkest fears and their unique link with sex in an almost Cronenbergian way. The alien is all the more scary because it isn't infected by Hollywood thinking: it's not out to take over the galaxy, to destroy mankind. It's just a predator, not even unique, sharing similarities with Earth-bound parasites on a larger scale and finally, at the end, it is the end old struggle: a woman against a monster (is it the alien then the ultimate rapist?). Alien finally then fits into the horror mould of the seventies and eighties in a tradition that continues to this day: the lone, heroic woman trying to survive against a knife-obsessed killer. Alien then has its roots in the Giallo, transplanted to America via Halloween (amongst others) and brought into space. In space, no one can hear you scream.",9,0,1,21 March 2013
The Book Thief," Amiable but Tame
","'The Book Thief' (2013), the début film of Brian Percival, who previously directed episodes of TV shows like 'Downton Abbey' and 'North & South', is adapted from the 2005 novel by Markus Zusak. In its telling of a coming-of-age story of a young girl, growing up in Hitler's Germany during World War Two, the film works amiably enough. Certainly, Percival elicits fine performances from his cast, particularly Nélisse as the precocious heroine, Rush as the kindly surrogate father and Watson playing the frosty mother. They provide an emotional centre that's crucial to the picture's success and while their characters are never as sketched-in as one would hope, the capable actors allow the audience to identify and empathise with them as they undergo wartime trials and tribulations.For a first feature film, Percival brings an eye for the small-scale from television; despite taking place in a limited location (mainly the Heaven Street where Liesel lives), he avoids any feeling of constraint. He crafts a slow rhythm to the life of Liesel that's appropriate for the small town it's set-in, a commendable illusion of verisimilitude immeasurably aided by Florian Ballhaus' cinematography. The wide-angle shots of snowy landscapes and dramatic red-and-white swastika flags all contribute to grounding the movie in the atmosphere of its specific epoch.However, the film suffers from a number of different elements. The rather arch conceit of having Death narrate the movie (voiced by Roger Allam), while it might work on the printed-page, seems out of place and ultimately places a comfortable distance between us and the tragedies on screen. In particular, the sugar-coating of its downbeat ending removes any real pain, leaving only a vague pathos. This is compounded by John William's Oscar-nominated score, redolent of his soundtrack for 'Schindler's List' (1993), and in its heavy emphasis on string instruments, blatantly attempts to emotionally manipulate the viewer and push the sentimentality to the extent that it feels forced and un-earned.So many clichés, from stiff Nazi villains to the triumphant message of the power of reading, are presented unquestioningly, as po-faced as possible and without the saving grace of irony. This is fundamentally a gentle film; the horrors of war are delicately kept out of the way and even when the family is apparently starving, Liesel looks the epitome of a healthy young child. If taken on its own terms and in a receptive mood, 'The Book Thief' plays well enough, but its lack of any bite means that it will likely grow hazy in memory.",6,1,2,28 October 2014
Battleship Potemkin," The Best Silent Film.
","'Bronenosets Potyomkin' is my favourite silent film. Apart from the now famous (legandry?) step sequence, it holds over delights(?), such as: the rotting food with maggots in it (shown in a quite a gruesome closeup) that the crew are made to eat, the actual mutiny on board the ship, and the unbearably tense climax, where the Russien battleships come to quash the uprising. One of the more horrific shots, shows a elderly woman having her eye shot out, by the troops during the steps scene.Sergi M. Eisenstein went on too make many more brilliant movies, such as 'Alexander Nevsky', but he never beat this.",10,1,2,9 March 2009
Life of Pi," Superbly Intelligent.
","'Life of Pi', directed by the Oscar winning Ang Lee, is a film, at first glance, of survival, as Pi (Suraj Sharma) attempts to live on an open-top boat in the Pacific after the ship the Tsimtsum sinks. However, it is in fact a philosophical drama about religion that only rarely becomes heavy handed.Based on the Booker-prize winning 2001 novel by Yann Martel, this exploration of faith is anchored in Suraj Sharma's performance. Apart from one scene with Gérard Depardieu as the ship's cook, Adil Hussain as Pi's father, there to spout scientific platitudes about religion that fail to organically grow from his character, and Rafe Spall as a writer to give a trigger to the telling of the story, this is Sharma' film. With only a perfectly CGI-created tiger to work with, he manages to evocatively to bring out what it would be like to be stuck in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is a tour-de-force, a true feat that never falls into actor's tricks.The special effects for the tiger, Richard Parker, the other member on this boat of literally lost souls, are incredible. Every hair and every sinew is present and his eyes, previously a difficult proposition in the realm of effects, make him look like a real Bengali tiger. A triumph, this construct is groundbreaking in terms of what can be achieved with a computer and surely will be capitalised on in years to come by Hollywood and its environs.The cinematography by Claudio Miranda, a man who has worked on many of David Fincher's films, is ineffable and will surely with the Academy Award. Overhead visions of water, still as glass, showing us the tiny lifeboat as the sky is reflected is brilliant not just for it's beauty but also serving a story telling purpose to: not only does it shown how alone and isolated Pi is, but also immediately tells us the audience what time of day it is from the colours of the sky.The 3D is well used, giving the sea an ethereal quality and a scene with flying fish demonstrates how the medium works at its best.Ang Lee's direction is sensitive but he can handle the big set pieces like the sinking of the ship excellently. Being based on a book, a few novelistic things are held over and do not works completely and sometimes, early on in the film, the discussions on religion are too blunt and direct. These are minor quibbles though; this is a major achievement in filmmaking, its $120 million budget well spent and the $300 million it has made so far has been well earned, showing to Hollywood that there is an audience for superbly intelligent, contemplative movies.",8,1,3,4 January 2013
Interstellar," Ambitious, Startling: Truly Stellar
","'Interstellar' (2014), directed by Christopher Nolan, is a wildly ambitious science fiction film, an original film that seems an anomaly in contemporary Hollywood, not based on a franchise or well-known book. With a screenplay written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, it belongs to the tradition of inquisitive sci-fi, following in the path struck by Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) and Roger Zemeckis' 'Contact' (1997), seeking to explore deep space and what it holds for humanity. It would be churlish to reveal too much about what McConaughey's crew find through the wormhole, but suffice to say that the planets they do explore feel grounded in reasonable conjecture that reflects the real risks of interplanetary travel. The film in particular captures both the frightening beauty of space, courtesy of Hoyte van Hoytema's luminous, beautiful cinematography. One of the film's most powerful scenes is McConaughey watching twenty-three years worth of recorded messages sent by his children, seeing his daughter Murph grow up in a matter of minutes (played as a child by Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain), a devastating commentary on what is known as 'spacetime'.The scenes on Earth are equally compelling, the first act shows a world not so far in the future suffering from a blight that has ravaged crops across the globe. McConaughey and his family live in the American Midwest which is dominated by dust storms; Nolan cleverly intercuts reminiscences from those who survived the dustbowl during the Great Depression to underline the connection with the past.It's a sign of Nolan's standing that he can pull together such a fine cast: Oscar-winner McConaughey is supported by Anne Hathaway, Academy-award nominee Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Michael Caine with Bill Irwin providing the voice of the dryly acerbic robot TARS. Nolan deftly juggles both the spectacle (provided by both models for the spaceships and computer-generated imagery) and the characters, creating a fully-rounded film where we're invested in the drama of McConaughey longing to return to his children: it's this trust in emotion rather than the shock and awe of visual effects that gives the film its heart and soul and sets it apart from other Hollywood blockbusters.Nolan's film has an aspiration to greatness that shames all other films in its league; daringly original and ultimately moving, propelled by its organ-driven Hans Zimmer score. Its conclusion though may be too pat, more wish-fulfilment than reality. Yet taking the movie as a whole, it's a forgivable slip in the scheme of a much grander vision.",9,2,8,28 January 2015
Pacific Rim," Furious Excellence.
","'Pacific Rim', directed by Guillermo del Toro, is a science fiction film that takes a long dormant genre, the Japanese Kaiju monster films of the 1950s and 1960s. They featured such creatures as Godzilla and a variety of others, del Toro not so much reinventing it but bringing it right back up to date. George Lucas' special effects company, Industrial Light & Magic, has created a world that is in the near-future but feels like tomorrow, the textures of the both the giant 'jaegers' and monsters so realistic that even without 3D, you can feel that you can even touch them. The effects are simply put, outstanding and so far the best this year.Yet del Toro, who directed the acclaimed Oscar-winning 'Pan's Labyrinth' and the pair of 'Hellboy' films, and his scriptwriter Travis Beacham, know that for the film to be more than merely 'mecha vs. monsters', real characters need to be created and invested with real emotions. In interviews, del Toro said 'We cannot pretend this is Ibsen', so the characters like Becket, Pentecost and Mori are strongly defined people who, through the equally powerful performances from Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba and Rinko Kikunchi give us a film where we care what happens and mean the final climactic sacrifices are actually poignant, as opposed to manufactured drama with little thought behind it.Charlie Day and Burn Gorman, who play a pair of bantering scientists along with Ron Perlman, who is a black marketer in Hong Kong dealing in kaiju organs, are vividly sketched supporting characters who provide an antidote to the seriousness of the main plot. The humour isn't cynical or used to self-consciously comment on the film, but instead springs naturally from the characters. For a film with such a potentially risible concept and execution, it's a pleasant surprise to discover it to be so well written.The art direction and design of the mechs and monsters is superb, as is the envisioning of Hong Kong, a strangely beautiful world of iridescent lights of all colours, like a pop art version of 'Blade Runner'. The cinematography of the Oscar winning Guillermo Navarro is excellent too, capturing the nuances of the oily, technical world the film lives in while also bringing out the colours for the maximum dramatic effect. The editing by Peter Amundson and John Gilroy in collaboration with del Toro wisely chooses to go for slower cuts, in particular in the many and frequent action scenes, so as to render them intelligible and to allow the audience not only to understand what is going on but also so that they know the geography of the situation.The major flaw, apart from Ramin Djawadi's blandly generic score, is perhaps the action scenes themselves. Taken individually, each one is shot and edited very well, but by the end, there is a slight, creeping sense of audience fatigue. This is compounded by the fact that the film's most memorable scene is Kikuchi's flashback, which deals with the impact and aftermath of the monsters, rather than a long, extensive battle scene.Despite this, taken as a whole, 'Pacific Rim' is a whole lot of fun and easily the best summer blockbuster of the year. Oh, and stay through the credits: there is a nice little post-credits scene that deals with the fate of a certain character.",9,25,39,7 August 2013
Oblivion," An Extended, Overlong Homage to '70s Sci-Fi Films.
","'Oblivion' (2013), directed by Joseph Kosinski, who previously made 'Tron: Legacy' (2010), is an extended homage to science fiction films in the 1970s. The script, by Kosinksi and Oscar-winner William Monahan with uncredited touch-ups by Michael Arndt, appears to be an amalgam of a disparate batch of films, from 'Logan's Run' (1976) and '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) to 'Solaris' (1972) and 'Planet of the Apes' (1968). This similarity with sci-fi films of the past paradoxically is both its major strength and weakness.In reinvention of iconic scenes, such as black and white flashbacks to New York echoing Gilliam's 'Twelve Monkeys', its use of design with immaculate white, angular flying Bubble Ships and living quarters, we are given some stunningly beautiful, perfectly envisioned concepts. Claudio Miranda, who won the Academy Award for 'Life of Pi' (2012), shoots the landscapes on location in Iceland, breathtakingly utilising the widescreen to maximum effect.However, films are more than a collection of attractive shots edited together; they have plot, characters, direction. For a futuristic film, the ideas element is all the more prescient and this is where 'Oblivion' falters. Too little is new or resembling originality. Anyone well-versed in cinema will see where the twists are coming and none of the characters, despite a good cast including Tom Cruise, Andrea Riseborough, Olga Kurylenko and Morgan Freeman, connect and engage. Cruise's character in particular doesn't work well enough; the writing is too generic and not insightful enough, a disaster when the film pivots around him.Kosinski's direction displays his variable talent, his penchant for framing sequences to best effect and building up a vivid sense of geography. Yet the people in his shots flounder, the character 'moments' not hiding his disinterest compounded by the story's weaknesses. Pacing too is an issue with Kosinski and his editor Richard Francis-Bruce struggling to find a proper rhythm to the film. Some scenes are much too long, others are seemingly abandoned, meaning that even at a mere two hours long, the movie feels a drawn out affair.If 'Oblivion' is imperfect, when it does work, Kosinksi is shown to be a director who has skill, can direct complex technical scenes and has a kinetic way with action. It is his abandonment of actors, intended or not, that undercuts his efforts. The film finally, despite looking very good, is less than the sum of its parts.",6,0,0,4 May 2013
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's Most Enjoyable Film.
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' (1959) is not his best film. It dose not have the intensity and thought provoking treatment that his 'Vertigo' (1959) has. However, this is missing the point. 'North By Northwest' was devised as entertainment, not art, which 'Vertigo' is quite possibly is, so, trying to read meanings in this film is pointless. 'North By Northwest' is the most enjoyable film the Master of Suspense ever created, finding the perfect hero in Cary Grant, who memorable encounters including the now iconic crop-duster scene and drunken drive along Long Island's coast. 'North By Northwest' has echos from as far back as his 'The 39 Steps' and 'Saboteur', but it always feels fresh and exciting. A true masterpiece.",10,1,3,2 May 2009
Ender's Game," Engaging Science Fiction
","'Ender's Game' (2013), directed by the South African Gavin Hood, is a military science fiction film based on Orson Scott Card's cult novel of the same name from 1985. It's a film that is more complex than it initially appears, the exposition-leaden opening thankfully not an indicator of what is to come, with Hood using cinematic techniques to tell the story rather than using any trite narrative clutches such as voice-over. Instead, the script (also written by Hood), introduces the figure of Ender, played by a marvellously cold Asa Butterfield, and his submergence into a future world of complex military strategy. The presence of many other child actors, even the Oscar-nominated Hailee Steinfeld and Abigail Breslin fail to make much impact. Yet this isn't a downside as much as it appears; Ender is supposed to be isolated and withdrawn, and it is appropriate for a film seen through his eyes that we scarcely get to known anything more than the broad strokes of personality from his compatriots in 'Command School'.The older members of the cast though, disappointingly, don't register as much as they need to. Harrison Ford's Colonel Graff is rather one-note, only Ben Kinsley's unconventional character Mazer Rackham being memorable. The script fairly abandons them all to the sidelines and favours Ender above all else; thankfully, Butterfield is more than capable to meet that challenge, delivering an excellent child performance for a none too likable character. He's the film's strongest point.The direction is good, even exhilarating in the scenes of stimulated zero gravity battle. The $110 million budget has been well used, credibly creating orbiting space stations and ships. The future imagined isn't so far from are our world, the suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience not so great. It follows the path of films as diverse as '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) and 'Minority Report' (2002) that realised the future is made more plausible by having ties to the present.Unfortunately, the ingenious twist ending, which probably works better on the page than it does on the screen, has, by necessity, almost to mould the movie in reverse leaving a curious sense of distance and lack of tension to the climax, while the epilogue goes into a bizarre realm which feels out of tone with the rest of the film.The film is still an enjoyable science fiction movie, professional and well-made, but it suffers from the feeling it may have even been better had it been braver in adapting the source novel and not felt so obliged to try and translate aspects of it that don't work on the silver screen.",9,85,150,30 October 2013
The Lego Movie," The Building Blocks of Animation Greatness
","'The Lego Movie', directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is a 3D animated film that exists in a world created out of Lego. This Danish company, 65 years old, is an iconic favourite and perennial feature of the children's toy market. This might be a reason for cynicism, fears of a 100 minute advertisement perhaps well founded. However, instead, it is a clever, sly subversive comedy that keeps the innate charm of the toy, while having fun at mocking business and a consumerist society of uniformity. The animation style is slightly clunky, replicating with striking fidelity the limited articulation of the original figures and the almost stop-motion quality aesthetic of the world created. The computer generated imagery is extraordinary in mirroring the plastic blocks' texture and helping make the Lego city a wonder of imagined production design.This would all be without point though, if it were not for a very witty and humorous script, written by the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. They gleefully send-up the corporate world and the Lego brand's film tie-in ranges such as Star Wars and D.C. superheroes. They're ably abetted by a talented vocal cast, featuring Chris Pratt, Will Ferrel, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and a whole host of guest voices, from Jonah Hill to Billy Dee Williams. The jokes range from popular culture to very specific references to past Lego ranges, slapstick to in-jokes, satire to one-liners, in a melange designed to appeal to all ages. Lord and Miller know well that the finest children's movies are ones that attract adults as well, and here they achieve their goal with aplomb.Still, the film never quite avoids a sentimental, good-intentioned moral which so many films of this genre are saddled with. Its plot twist, influenced by 'The Matrix' (1999), whilst initially surprising and amusing does eventually lose some of its ingenuity. Some of the action scenes go on far too long, excessive demonstrations of versatility that are never as fun as just the pure moments of comedy. The script eventually has to resolve the conflicts it sets up, leading to a slightly weaker second half overall.Yet this is never enough to sour 'The Lego Movie', which, on the contrary, is mainly a delight, always funny and far cleverer than any movie based on a children's toy has any right to be.",8,1,4,4 April 2014
Duck You Sucker," Flawed, but with Scenes of Great Power.
","'Duck, You Sucker' (1971) Duck, You Sucker! (Italian: GiÃ¹ la testa), also known as 'A Fistful of Dynamite' and 'Once Upon a TimeÂ… the Revolution', is the last Spaghetti Western directed by the legendary Sergio Leone and it is also his penultimate film - his last being the gangster epic 'Once Upon a Time in America' (1984) with Robert De Niro and James Woods. This however, stars James Coburn and Rod Steiger in what is probably Leone's most patchy Spaghetti Western.The screenplay was written by Sergio Donati, Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni and follows the escapades of John Mallory (James Coburn) in 1913 during the Mexican revolution, an Irish Republican explosives expert who has fled from Ireland after killing British soldiers. In Mexico, he meets Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger), a Mexican outlaw and together they raid the great bank of Mesa Verde. However, John has already joined forces with the revolutionaries.The screenplay is rather episodic at times and there does seem to be a lack of focus, especially up to the bank raid. After that, politics and the revolution are brought into sharper reality. The direction too, is fantastic at certain points. The scene where John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan's family and children, have been killed by the army in a cave is one of the best pieces of work Leone ever did. The massacre, later on in the movie, shot in an abandoned sugar mill in one shot, is so huge and horrifying that it amounts to one of the best depictions of mass murder on film. Yet at other times, the direction seems to be rather by-the-numbers and not at all inspired, like the slightly predictable shoot-em-up final. The cinematography by Giuseppe Ruzzolini, though, is excellent at all times, as is Ennio Morricone's strange score that will definitely grow on you. The performance by James Coburn is his usual minimalist stuff, but he does that very, very well. Rod Steiger sometimes overacts, yet it is different from anything else he did.So, it is not Sergio Leone's best movie; in fact it is probably not even as good as his basic (if classic) 'A Fistful of Dollars' (1964). Yet when the film gets it act together, there are scenes that equal the best he ever did.",8,0,1,30 August 2011
Gone with the Wind," A Massive Epic From America's Goldern Age.
","I am not a huge fan of Romantic Wheepies. You will find not me in the Cinema watching, for instance, 'Away From Her', or seeing the latest Terminal Illness Made-For-TV-Movie. Then how I come I have watched Victor Fleming's 'Gone with the Wind' (1939)? Simply because I knew it was a All-Time-Classic and thought that even people like me have seen it and enjoyed it. So, one Sunday afternoon, I sat down and watched it. And against my better judgement, I throughly enjoyed it. Why was this? Because everything in it was done perfectly from the wondrous acting from Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Thomas Mitchell to the great screenplay worked on literally hundreds of people right done to the sumptuous direction. A film that is truly a delight.",10,2,3,21 May 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," An Incredible Evocation of the World of Middle Earth.
","'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' (2013), directed by Peter Jackson, is the middle film of the three part adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkein's novel 'The Hobbit', first published in 1937. Surprisingly, it manages to avoid most problems associated with a second film of three, such as a sense of redundancy, maintaining interest throughout and actually surpassing 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' (2012), the first part in the series. The prolonged introductions and establishment of the major plot line of the first film, while embraced by some, where criticised by others. Here, with the clarity of a straightforward aim for the multiple characters, there is a new sense of direction and lucidity in Jackson's storytelling. Jackson's aided by the script written by himself, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro.While the acting throughout is never less than fine, and Martin Freeman continues to impress as Bilbo, the true star is Middle Earth, a world that Jackson has managed to transform into a living, breathing environment that thanks to the wonders of modern special effects, never looks less than real. From the dark Mirkwood forest to the seemingly 15th century Northern European inspired architecture of Lake-town, this is an incredibly rich and diverse setting for any tale that like all the great fantasy films, transports you into another world, another time, helped in part by the high frame rate 3D. The production design, by Dan Hennah, and the costume design, by Bob Buck, Ann Maskrey and Richard Taylor, is extraordinary in realising and texturing Jackson's world (which is filmed on location in New Zealand).The screenplay however, isn't quite as perfect as one would wish, superior though it is to the first film, continuing the introduction of elements not present in the novel. A divisive move that does tend to reinforce more conventional action elements along with an underplayed romantic triangle concerning Orlando Bloom (reprising his role as Legolas from 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy [2001 – 2003]), Evangeline Lily (as the Wood Elf Tauriel) and Aidan Turner (as Kili the dwarf). This perhaps reveals a lack of confidence in the source material stretching across three films.These doubts don't dispel Jackson's major directorial achievement on display here and it is his grasp of Middle Earth, taking it from J.R.R. Tolkein's imagination to the silver screen that leaves this one of the best films of 2013.",9,2,7,5 January 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Let the Magic Begin...
","'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' simultaneously takes director Peter Jackson in two different directions. While at first glance it may seem that he is travelling over familiar ground, again tackling the fantastical world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth after his vast and Academy Award wining 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy (2001 – 2003), he is actually experimenting with cinema itself.Of all the art forms of the world, film is the one most invested in technology; created by scientists, not artists at the end of the nineteenth century. It was only at the dawn of the last century that people like Georges Méliès realised the potential of this medium. So it is appropriate that Jackson is here breaking new ground with the very way we watch films. Instead of shooting at the normal speeds of twenty four frames per second, he has doubled it to forty eight frames a second so when viewed you have an astonishing clarity of detail as well as smoothness in camera movement with no motion stutter or blurry jerkiness when shown in 3D.However, this raises a problem for the filmmaker. For a film set in a mythical fantasy land, any poor special effects or sub-standard computer generated imagery will stand out glaringly. So the effects work from Weta Digital is all the more impressive and astounding; from skin textures to the manifold buildings of Rivendell, it's sometimes hard to believe it's not all real.The acting, from Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen to Christopher Lee as Saruman and Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, leader of the dwarfs, are all very good, inhabiting their roles with conviction and passion. Stand out though is Andy Serkis as Gollum, the famous riddle scene from the novel imported virtually word for word, and is all the better for it. Serkis has an uncanny ability to play these none too human characters with an enormous amount of vicissitude, a feat he pulls of here again with aplomb. This is primarily a visual motion picture, but the characters are not ignored and the extensive opening sequence set in Bilbo's house serves as an introduction of sorts to not just the people but the themes as well.Jackson directs with huge scope and a true feeling for the vast land he is creating, shot on location in New Zealand. The sweeping cinematography from Andrew Lesnie is suitably epic, making the landscape another character in the film.The film does have its flaws, mainly due to the fact that this is an introduction to a trilogy and not a self-contained movie; people might also find Radagast the Brown, a wizard, as played by Sylvester McCoy, to fall on perhaps the wrong side of immaturity. Still, this is a fantastic piece of entertainment and it's hard to imagine a better Christmas film.",9,140,242,2 January 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," Mesmerisng.
","David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia' (1962) is one of the few films that I would call mesmerising. The acting by all the leads is brilliant. Peter O'Tool is just superb as Lawrence. His performance could quite possibly be the greatest role ever. Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal was one of the more strange acting choices (he plays an Arab), but Guinness is very good and (the then) newcomer Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali ibn el Kharish is astonishingly good, and there are a lot more great actors in the movie like Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, and Arthur Kennedy. All the different departments did everything to perfection, (espesially the breathtaking Cinematography by Freddie Young) and the direction and script are flawless. One to watch in a sitting.

Lincoln," Daniel Day-Lewis and Steven Spielberg Combine to Make Movie Magic.
","'Lincoln', directed by Steven Spielberg, was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Tommy Lee Jones) and Best Supporting Actress (Sally Field); it won two, Best Actor, Daniel Day-Lewis and Best Production Design, Rick Carter. A film so weighed down by awards glory has to stand tall to meet expectations. It does so magnificently. Steven Spielberg is arguably one of the most assured and consistently great directors in the modern cinematic landscape; his career stretching back to the beginning of the nineteen-seventies has produced classic after classic, from adventure in 'Raider's of the Lost Ark' (1981) to the Holocaust drama 'Schindler's List' (1993). His extraordinary versatility serves him well again, transforming a potentially dry historical drama of interest only to Americans into a riveting examination of democracy, of the inherent compromise and double-dealing to pass what was then a controversial and contested bill.Yet Spielberg is not alone: Tony Kushner has excelled himself in writing one of the most intelligent, literate scripts in years, providing fantastic dialogue and characters for Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, David Strathairn and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. All these actors clearly relish the opportunity to be part of this incisive drama and give superlative performances. However, Daniel Day-Lewis gives not only the performance of the year, but one of the best of the past decade. From his historically accurate whiny, high-pitched voice to his bowed walk, wearied by years of war, grown old before his time, this isn't a matter of impersonation: Day-Lewis exhibits all the best virtues of method acting; there is no trace of him as an actor. We have a real performance and an in-depth examination of a few crucial weeks and months that changed the history of a nation.It's the moral assessment by Lincoln as to what to do and crucially, how to do it, whether the ends justify the means, that helps make it universal in appeal. Spielberg looks lucidly into the events and spares nothing. No glamorisation, no white-washing: Lincoln, an all-American icon, is distraught, indecisive and watches as his wife is mentally affected at the prospect of losing a son to a dying war and the way public and private lives intertwine seamlessly.Only the ending, showing the aftermath of his assassination by John Wilkes Booth (an event that avoids cliché by not showing it) seems unnecessary. It had found the perfect ending ten minutes before, as Lincoln sets off to see the play where he would meet his killer. It's a rare misstep made more jarring by the fact that the film has so few of them.However, it is not enough to stop this film from being a superb union between Kushner, Spielberg and Day-Lewis who create one of the great movies of this still young decade.",9,0,2,13 March 2013
Everest," A High Peak of Cinema
","'Everest' (2015), directed by Baltasar Kormákur who has been known only for generic action films like 'Contraband' (2012) and '2 Guns' (2013). Yet here he makes a beautifully-executed film which never takes a misstep, capturing both the awe and terrific danger of Mount Everest. The film sets out to examine the disparate group of people who are willing to pay $65,000 and risk all by trying to reach the summit, which we're solemnly informed by Rob Hall, is at the altitude of a cruising Boeing 747.Kormákur's strength as a director, allows the actors to imbue their real characters with a sense of naturalism, from the mailman Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) to the Texan bravado of Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin). The script, by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, takes an ensemble approach to its narrative, a mosaic of climbers from which emerges a community with underlying tensions between experienced mountaineers and 'tourists' paying to get to Everest's peak. Poor decisions made at over 29,000 feet can be fatal, especially when compounded by the fierce intensity of the Himalyan weather.Kormákur actually shot at the Everest base camp and filmed climbing scenes in the Italian Alps, giving the film a powerful realism; watching it, you feel the sub-zero temperatures and the vertiginous heights. He's also adept at building tension, particularly in showing climbers crossing a ladder at Everest's Kumbu Ice Fall, where just from the sound alone, we wince at every step taken. It's an extraordinary tense film, especially as, being based on real events, we know some will not survive. Yet Kormákur refuses to sentimentalise the drama, lending a dignity to the ill-fated characters: death is not over-dramatised, instead the fragility of life on the mountain is emphasised. He's aided immeasurably by an excellent cast: Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, John Hawkes, Josh Brolin and Emily Watson. If there's a criticism to be made, the film sometimes spreads itself too thinly, and actors like Sam Worthington and Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson are relegated to the background.The clarity of Salvatore Totino's cinematography enables us to appreciate the savage beauty of the mountains while the editing of Mick Audsley admirably clarifies a complex story, cross-cutting between base camp and the different groups fighting their way back down through a horrific storm. It's a dramatic survival film, rooted in humanity enduring the extremes of nature, but it never looses sight of the individual. It's the rare Hollywood film which believes in character and employs special effects in the service of the story, to create an entirely satisfying piece of cinema.",8,1,2,23 September 2015
Singin' in the Rain," The Greatest Musical of All Time.
","'Singin' in the Rain' is undoubtedly the greatest musical of all time. Forget all those rumours that Gene Kelly wasn't a very nice person, or that nearly all the songs weren't original, and that the 'Make'm Laugh' number was blatant copy of another song, all that matters is that its brimming with jokes, a brilliant performance from Jean Hagen, and the best musical number of all time ('Singin' in the Rain'), wonderfully sung by Gene Kelly. The plot, which is better than most musicales, is about Hollywoods transition from silents too talkies and (of course) Gene Kelly's character, Don Lockwood, falling in love with Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds).

Avatar," A Movie You Must See in the Cinema!
","This is a film that you need to see on the big screen. The bigger, the better. This movie is James Cameron new 'epic' and anything less that a large screen will not do it justice. The special effects are staggering, even if they are CGI and Motion-Capture. At times, Cameron blurs the points of what is real and what is computer generated. Sigourney Weaver is very good as a humane scientist and gives the films best performance, even if scenery chewing villain Stephen Lang comes a honourable second. Now that I have said that the special effects are indeed special (the planet of Pandora is staggering; every little insect is down to a tee, nothing is missed) and should (nay, will) win all the awards at the Acadamy Awards, lets delve into its weak points. First off, the story is not Earth shatteringly brilliant and has been done many, many times before in different settings and if the love story is redundant at least is doesn't take up to much screen time and the final battle fully compensates for that. Also, most of the performances range from the okay (Sam Worthington) to the bland (Michelle Rodriguez). All in all, a movie well worth seeing, but only at the cinema.",7,0,3,21 December 2009
Selma," Fine Civil Rights Drama
","'Selma' (2014), directed by Ava DuVernay, is a snapshot of the US Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s and its attempts to get black Americans the vote in segregated southern states.DuVernay has crafted a film which consistently refuses to take an idealistic perspective, ensuring the movie remains on a human scale throughout. It takes King as a significant but fallible figure; the British actor David Oyelowo perfectly captures the rhythms and cadence of his speech, although one of the strongest scenes in the film is where he is confronted over his marital infidelities by his wife, Coretta Scott King (Carmen Ejogo). This mixture of the historical and the personal is the film's most impressive asset, refusing to succumb to a hagiographic awe and thus bearing comparison in approach to Spielberg's 'Lincoln' (2012).Oyelowo embodies King throughout with admirable intensity and conviction; no better performance could be asked for. He's ably supported by a cast including Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon Johnson, Tim Roth as Alabama governor George Wallace and various other recognisable faces such as Martin Sheen and Giovanni Ribisi. However, it's clearly Oyelowo's film from the very beginning and is actually at its weakest when the film shifts it's focus, such as the scenes between Lyndon Johnson and J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), director of the FBI. Not only have issues been raised about their historical credibility, but they fail to have the same emotional resonance and momentum as the sequences showing how King and his associates actually go through the complex problems of organising the march. The infamous attack on the protesters by the police and civilian militia on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, shows DuVernay's skills as director, the fog of tear gas and the wounded, running people, shot and cut like a war scene.Cinematographer Bradford Young shoots with a palette of warm brown and golden tones and DuVernay certainly isn't afraid of letting Young's camera sit unobtrusively in medium shot, letting the audience experience the actors' interactions and performances, most notably when King and another activist just cruise along the darkened Selma streets, reflecting on recent, tumultuous events.The film is at its weakest when trying to cover too much, such as factional in-fighting in different civil rights groups or when it starts to resemble standard Hollywood biopics with the final triumphant scene at Alabama's state capitol: it's undoubtedly stirring but feels a little formulaic. 'Selma' is at its best when it takes an alternative tack to the usual Hollywood formulations and delivers an intimate portrayal of a crucial moment in American history.",7,0,1,13 May 2015
The Artist," A Consummate Example of Pure Cinema.
","'The Artist', directed by Michel Hazanavicius, is an exquisite love letter not only to silent cinema, but to the Golden Age of Hollywood. Inspired by the likes of 'A Star is Born' and 'Singin' in the Rain', this five time Academy Award winner, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, successfully uses silent film technique to enhance the story rather than using it as a gimmick to attract attention.If there is an artist in this film, then it is the director for brilliantly using all the devices of cinema to create a world that does not need sound: it is a world unto itself, inhabited by people like Jean Dujardin, who seemingly effortlessly make us understand his psychosocial and emotional state through his body language. It is a difficult task for any actor, but Dujardin pulls it off with aplomb.The direction too is outstanding, fully utilising all manner of cinematic tricks to show what can be done; this is pure film using images to convey the plot without relying on dialogue.In fact the only two uses of sound are marvellously handled: the first, in a wonderfully surreal dream of Valentin, his fears plague him with a nightmare about the coming of 'talkies' to Hollywood. Then normal sound is restored in the very final scene and the effect is like watching your very first movie: magical.The score by Ludovic Bource is very, very good, underlining the emotional resonance boldly, adding another layer of excellence to the film.If it has any faults, it is that in quoting such a vast array of cinematic legends, from Fritz Lang to 'Citizen Kane' (1941), 'Sunset Boulevard' (1950) to Douglas Fairbanks, it sabotages itself by being too sophisticated and knowing; this is not a film that could ever have been made in the 1920's. However, it is a small flaw when put into perspective against the joy and freedom of expression found in the silent film technique that overflows onto the screen.This is a consummate example of what the cinema can do when all of the film's makers are at the top of their talent and skill; breathtaking.",9,2,4,28 May 2012
Woman in Gold," Far from Golden
","'Woman in Gold' (2015), directed by Simon Curtis, is anchored by Mirren's performance. She has the sharp, intelligent, quintessentially Austrian character of Maria Altmann down to the slightest mannerism, Mirren disappearing into her character. It's to the credit of the script, by Alexi Kaye Campbell, that it creates a character so strongly delineated, as well as letting Mirren (who won an Academy Award for her performance in 'The Queen' (2006)) suggest the inner vulnerabilities which her tough exterior seeks to hide.If it's a powerful, memorable performance, then it's unfortunate that it outclasses the surrounding film. The material, tackling the important issue of the repatriation of art stolen by the Nazis, to their true owners, highlights the complex nature of modern-day Austrian society, still uncomfortable about its role in aiding Hitler during World War II. However, Curtis doesn't seem up to the task. Previously having directed 'My Week with Marilyn' (2011), his treatment too often errs on the side of the predictable, bathing flashbacks to the Anschluss (the German annexation of Austria in 1939) in the now customary desaturated palette, providing a gloss on the past. Neither is there the hoped-for dynamism in handling the complex series of court cases that had to be fought against the Austrian government, both in Austria and the United States. The intricacies are glazed over in favour of dramatic speeches, although Ryan Reynolds as the lawyer is surprisingly good and manages to play the moments of humour early on in the film to maximum effect.There's an extensive cast, including Daniel Brühl as a sympathetic Austrian journalist, Charles Dance enjoying himself as a brusque head of a law firm and Jonathan Pryce in one scene playing the Supreme Court's Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, although Katie Holmes is given nothing to do as Reynolds' wife.The film's major flaw then, is its script, from which Curtis is tied to. There's no insight into Klimt and the eponymous 'Woman in Gold', Adele Bloch-Bauer I, is an exotic enigma, as flat as Klimt's portrait of her. Shot in opalescent golds, in a literal cinematic transcription of her portrait, we never know who she is. Tethered to Mirren's character childhood memories of her, her Austrian past is rendered as a simplistic golden era destroyed by the coming of Nazism. There's no attempt to confront the existing anti-Semitism that was rife in Austria throughout the early 20th century, long before Hitler's ascent to power; ultimately, the film sells the past short. It's on steadier ground with Mirren and Reynolds grappling with the Austrian government's attempts to frustrate their claims to Klimt's masterpiece and these are the best portions of the film, perhaps as it focuses on Mirren and Reynolds, who have an undeniable screen chemistry. It's thanks to their efforts that this film still remains worth viewing.",6,1,2,30 September 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Original, Intelligent and Thrilling Sci-FI.
","'Edge of Tomorrow' (2014), directed by Doug Liman, is a military science fiction film that revolves around Cruise's character endlessly repeating the same day, always dying, to explore his evolution from coward to hero. By deftly showing Cruise's changing responses to the same people and events in the run-up to landing in the battle zone, he undergoes a subtle metamorphosis. From attempting blackmail on General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) in order to avoid action to eventually realising he alone can combat the alien threat, it's a well-written character arc. He is allowed to handle a complex role which can switch deftly from seriousness to black humour (stemming from him being able to predict what other characters' are about to say and do due to his multitude of deaths). It's his best performance in a long time, benefiting from the intelligence of the material he has to work with. It's also a testament to the script that the time loop never becomes tiresome, but instead is constantly inventive in its repetition, the storytelling enlivened by the elliptical editing of James Herbert and Laura Jennings. Scripted by Christopher McQuarrie, Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (based on the Japanese novel 'All You Need Is Kill' by Hiroshi Sakurazaka), they handle the variety of plot threads and main duplication of the same day very well.Emily Blunt, playing a renowned warrior, has the more limited role, her character 'reset' every time Cruise dies, but nevertheless shows her ability to project external strength and an admirable lack of sentiment in her training of Cruise. Bill Paxton as a tough Sergeant Major is fairly one-note, but it's a fun note all the same, Paxton clearly enjoying himself in his constant admonishing of Cruise.Director Liman is able to deal with kinetic action scenes as well as quieter, character-orientated moments, whilst cleverly altering how he films repeating sequences. The main battle scene on the French beach is a good example, initially staying with Cruise's point of view, but gradually revealing more information each time, until around midway through, Liman pulls his camera back and reveals in a long shot the enormity of the military operation. Visually, he and his cinematographer Dion Beebe are aided by the interesting production design, in particular the exoskeletons the soldiers wear and the design of the aliens themselves, which creates a neat dichotomy with the contemporary appearance of much of this near-future world.If its final act is slightly weaker, preventing it from becoming truly excellent, this is certainly a far sharper, original and more intriguing sci-fi action film than is normally found.",8,1,3,9 July 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," The Coens, '50s Style.
","'Hail, Caesar!' (2016), directed by the Academy-award winning Coen Brothers, is a light-hearted portrayal of nineteen-fifties Hollywood, where large film studios are all powerful. In amongst the barbs and repartee, the Coens' clearly feel an affinity with the era, and along with their cinematographer Roger Deakins, recreate the visual look of the decade with an uncanny precision. It's the first film in years to recall the Technicolor brightness of American pictures of that time; it reveals a real affection, while still maintaining a clear-eyed sense of the iniquities of the then-studio system. Studio executives control their stars' lives to the smallest degree, while waspish gossip columnists try to discover any scandal.The Coens add into this mix a number of pastiches, not just of Roman and Biblical epics, but of Westerns and musicals, with a spot-on musical number featuring Channing Tatum as a sailor (in clear reference to 'On the Town', 1949), one of the film's highlights. Being at heart a screwball comedy means the Coens' darker impulses are kept in check so that even the malevolent group the Future, who abduct George Clooney, are seen as charmingly misguided.Josh Brolin displays fine comic skill and brings a layer of nuance to his serially perturbed studio boss character, while the ensemble cast match the all-star extravaganzas so popular in the nineteen-fifties: everyone seems to appear, from Tilda Swinton to Scarlet Johansson, Jonah Hill to a very memorable Aldren Ehrenreich as a singing cowboy.Perhaps one criticism that could be made is that it never becomes more than the sum of its parts: the script, by the Coens, offers a wonderful whirlwind of episodes, jumping from Ralph Fiennes' refined director offering Ehrenreich elocution lessons to a distraught Brolin trying to hide the fact his biggest star is missing. Yet it never quite coheres into an organic whole and by the time it concludes, you're left feeling that it is a rather slight, shaggy-dog story: a lot of fun and frequently amusing, but not one of the Coens' masterworks, a minor work by major auteurs.However, it would be churlish to deny the film's many pleasures, from Carter Burwell's score to the production design by Jess Gonchor, with costumes from Mary Zophres. It's authentically nineteen-fifties and that alone is reason enough to see it; combined with witty performances and deft direction, it almost doesn't matter that the film is about very little. Enjoy the ride and forget about the destination.",7,0,1,31 March 2016
Jaws," An Extremely Tense Film.
","Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws' (1975) is a very tense movie. The film works on two very different levels: one, a simple shocker and the other is complex character study of three people ('Police Chief Martin Brody' played by Roy Scheider,'Matt Hooper' played by Richard Dreyfuss and 'Quint' played by Robert Shaw) dealing with horrific shark attacks. All the leads give excellent performances, so, unlike nowadays in a disaster movie, you actually care about the people nearly being (and in some cases) eaten alive by a giant shark (and the shark dos not looks very rubbery to me!). But be warned, the climax is very bloody and tense. Not a film for young children! A movie definitely worth watching.",8,3,6,11 April 2009
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Thrilling Climax to a 13-Year Long Saga
","The final part of 'The Hobbit' trilogy, 'The Battle of Five Armies' (2014), directed by Peter Jackson, is a hard film to judge. Shot at the same time as its two antecedents, 'An Unexpected Journey' (2012) and 'The Desolation of Smaug' (2013), for a speculated total cost of $745 million, it really has to be seen in the context of the entire three films. Certainly, Jackson seems to feel this way, the film opening with a direct continuation of Smaug laying waste to Laketown, offering no introduction for those unversed in the saga.There's further development of Richard Armitage's character, Thorin Oakenshield, leader of the band of dwarfs seeking to claim the gold under the Lonely Mountain, who descends into megalomania and greed. It's an intriguing turn and one based in character, which gives an emotional centre that might have otherwise have been lacking. That's due to the fact that, as per the title, the series' climatic battle dominates the film. It's thrilling, masterfully choreographed and the special effects utilised are impeccable but there's always the danger that the vast armies clashing can become distinctly impersonal. Jackson confronts this by a memorable fight between Thorin and the orc Azog (Manu Bennett) on a frozen river that reduces the conflict to a more thrilling, intimate level.It seems perverse to comment once more on the scriptwriters (Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Guillermo del Toro) lack of faithfulness to J.R.R. Tolkein's original 1937 novel. From the start, it was clear they weren't interested in making an accurate version but rather an expansive Middle-Earth epic and the detail surrounding its fantastical environment has always been the films' strongest suit. Here, the veracity of the characters' surrounding is compounded by the 3D and the high frame rate (48 frames a second as opposed to the standard 24 used for all other films) that puts the audience truly within the drama unfolding.The performances are fine, although one wishes that Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggins, ostensibly the main character, had more screen time. Jackson is cutting between so many story strands that it feels as though Bilbo gets lost in amidst the web of plot lines. Yet it's the most succinct of any of the films in the trilogy or The Lord of the Rings for that matter, which this acts as an extended overture to, and there is a certain satisfying quality to the final epilogue bringing to an end a series that has lasted thirteen years. Taken as a whole, 'The Hobbit' films may not have reached the same mythic resonance of their forbears, yet when viewed without such retrospective judgement, the films themselves come alive and dazzle the viewer like nothing else.",2,4,9,10 January 2015
Paths of Glory," Brilliant War Film.
","Stanly Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' (1957) is one of the very few First Wold War movies. I my opinion, the reason is that the death in WW1 was unbelievable. On the the first day alone in The Battle of the Somme (1916), the British suffered 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead, the single most bloodiest day in the history of the British Army - and remember, this was before the Atomic Bomb. Hollywood would probably not be able to tackle something so grim and depressing (althouh Hollywood might do a WW1 film nowadays, especially after such films as 'Shinderlers List' and 'Saving Privet Ryan') when Hollywood mainly deals in escapism. And that what makes 'Paths of Glory' so unusual. Seen from the French's point of view, it has three French solders being executed after taking lots because their unit is found guilty of cowardice while trying to take a German controlled hill, called the 'Ant Hill'. Kirk Douglas gives a fantastic performance as 'Colonel Dax' and so do Adolphe Menjou and George Macready. Stanly Kubrick's first masterpiece, and one definitely one to watch.",10,2,3,4 April 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," A Flawed, Disappointing End to the Trilogy
","'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012) is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's trilogy about the comic book superhero Batman, created in 1939 by Bill Finger and Bob Kane. The franchise, starting in 2005 with 'Batman Begins' and continuing in 'The Dark Knight' (2008) is brought to a conclusion, and traditional Hollywood thinking is used by the Warner Bros. Studio here: everything is bigger, louder and more explosive and with higher stakes than before. Yet this expansionism hasn't translated into greater quality; if anything, it is the most flawed of the trio. Continuity errors, plot holes and logic defying events plague the film incessantly. The screenplay, by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, feels like it is two or three drafts away from being a finished product. Geopolitical significance is constantly strived for, especially in the latter part of the film, yet it fails to fully grasp its own half-articulated ideas and ends feeling like the pat, smug 'safe' hawkish ideologies of a studio executive more interested in profit margins than ideas. All these mistakes are a repetition of the previous entry in the series; in many ways this perfectly encapsulates Hollywood: nothing forgotten, nothing learnt.Still, Nolan's direction is as impressive as ever, really delivering in the large scale set pieces that dot the picture. He brings a real energy to the screen that almost papers over the cracks in the story. The dynamic action scenes are hardly original though and the opening sequence is straight out of a James Bond movie.The acting is generally of a high standard, with Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Tom Hardy all very good. Unfortunately, the Oscar winning Marion Cotillard is given nothing to do and struggles to create a performance out of a poorly written character.The cinematography by Academy Award winner Wally Pfister is good and a cut above the usual standard found in the average superhero blockbuster, the same of which can be said for the editing by Lee Smith and the booming music score of Hans Zimmer.If then this climax to the Batman series is a disappointment, torpedoed by a below par script, then at least Christopher Nolan directs so well that you will be immersed in the film to the point where perhaps you will be more forgiving of its flaws and be swept along by this enjoyable spectacle.",7,11,22,4 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Franchise Awakens...
","'Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens' (2015), directed by J.J. Abrams, is the latest, much anticipated entry in a series that spans 38 years and counting. Every decade since the seventies has had its 'Star Wars' and this, the first in a decade, is the start of a new trilogy. George Lucas, the original creator and director of perhaps the most iconic (and financially successful) franchise of all time, sold the rights to the series to Disney in 2012 and it is intriguing to see what 'Star Wars' without Lucas is like.On the whole, it must be said, very good. Abrams, director of the recent 'Star Trek' (2009) reboot, working with Lawrence Kasdan (a noted director in his own right) and Michael Arndt, creates a host of memorable new characters: Finn and Rey are standouts, as well as fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and alien Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o). They're brought to life by a fine cast, with newcomers Ridley and Boyega comparing well to the returning cast, which includes a suitably gruff and laconic Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Carrie Fishers as Leia Organa. In many respects, these performances are the best part of the film. However, not all is so bright.Adam Driver, as the film's main villain, the masked, petulant Kylo Ren, lacks a distinctive presence and, in a first for the series, the nefarious evil force fighting the Resistance, seem a little colourless. Perhaps this is due in part to Abrams devotion to recreating the original films to such an extent that 'The Force Awakens' in much of its plotting operates as a recreation of 'A New Hope' (1977), not so much a sequel as a remake by stealth. Consequently, it lacks the wonder, awe and mystery that defined the first film and is more of an affectionate homage, with action scenes directly echoing previous ones. Even two shocking plot twists which it would be churlish to reveal, are not so very distant from previous films.It's exciting, it's funny and ends on a cliffhanger which will leave you waiting for the next instalment; however, it will also leave you hoping for a more original, creative film next time we visit a galaxy, a long time ago and far, far away...",8,3,31,16 January 2016
Kagemusha," A Long, But Fantastic, Film.
","Akira Kurosawa's 'Kagemusha' (1980) is one of those tremendously long films that somehow never drags. The plot is about a petty thief who is about to be crucified but is saved by a Japanese warlord called Lord Shingen because of his amazing resemblance to him and is used as a double. When the Lord is killed, and because of a plan laid by Shingen before he died, the so-call 'Shadow Warrior' must impersonate the Lord for three years. Aided by this clever plot, Kurosawa shows us Japanese court ritual, with help by a brilliant performance by Tatsuya Nakadai, gives a fascinating picture of fifteenth century Japan. This a fabulous movie, with a particularly moving ending, that shows just how great Akira Kurosawa is.",10,18,20,27 April 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," One of the Few Films From This Decade That Will Be Remembered.
","Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003) is a true epic, a film that Tolkien himself would have been proud of. As the three film quest comes to a brilliant and stupendous close, it isn't hard to imagine that these three movies, that have given us the equivalent of the 'Star Wars' trilogy for the twenty-first century, will be remembered in thirty years time, just like 'Star Wars' is. It is intriguing to compare both trilogy's, as after all, George Lucas's movies freely borrowed bits and pieces from J. R. R. Tolkien's books. Both of them start off with a farm boy who is sucked into dark and dangerous times where he must triumph over unimaginable evil. In both films, epic battles take place that you will remember your decades to come. And in both cases, good totally eradicates evil. Anyone who was involved with the creation of 'The Lord of the Rings' should be very, very proud to have help create this masterwork.",9,1,4,20 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," How Do You Review a Film Like Star Wars?
","How do you review George Lucas's 'Star Wars' (1977)? A movie that has become so cherished by millions of fans that most critics disregard it, a movie that has inspired people to create a religion based on the force and a movie that has become so famous that it is regarded as weird not to have seen at least one out of the six films? How do you review it? One of the few ways to actually read balanced reviews of it is to look at what the critics said when it was originally released, thirty-two years ago. At the time, unlike now, where most 'serious' movie critics treat it with contempt, they liked it. Roger Ebert called the film 'an out-of-body experience,' and Vincent Canby called the film 'the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure.' These reviews show us, that at the time, just about everybody (Pauline Kael, Jonathan Rosenbaum and Stanley Kauffmann excepted) agreed that 'Star Wars' was a great film. These are the critics (unbiased) opinions before the days of 'Star Wars' bashing became fashionable among the critical elite. And take it from me. Roger Ebert was right: It's an unbelievable experience.",10,1,2,13 October 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best Star Wars Film.
","This is, with out a doubt, the best 'Star Wars' film. Straight in from the beginning, there is action galore, with the Battle of Hoth, to the climatic duel between Luck Skywalker and Darth Vader, it never pause's or breath.Thanks to it being digitally remastered, there isn't a black line in sight. So, now when you are watching (this is my favourite battle of all the 'Star Wars' movies) the brilliantly exciting Battle of Hoth, there are no more annoying lines around the giant (but in reality just very large models) imperial walkers. The very best 'Star Wars' film.",10,1,2,28 February 2009
Saboteur," Flawed, but Entertaining.
","Alfred Hitchcock's 'Saboteur' (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock film, 'Sabotage' made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the Master of Suspense greatest film. It dose not have the depth of 'Vertigo' (1958) nor the brooding atmosphere of 'Rebbeca' (1940) and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in 'Notorious' (1946), but what it dose have is thrills, adventure and a nail biting climax. The two leads, admittedly, are quite weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the Robert Cummings role and Barbara Stanwyck for the role that was taken by Priscilla Lane. Also, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (that were written by Dorothy Parker) have dated badly, and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). However, the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing, the climax atop the Stature of Liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of 'North By Northwest' (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the Aircraft Factory is a superb sequence. This not the best film Hitch made, but it is surly one of his most entertaining.",8,2,3,1 May 2009
Spectre," Spectacular, Occasionally Flawed
","'Spectre' (2015), the twenty-fourth James Bond film, and directed by the Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, is a remarkably lithe affair. Mendes opens the film with an incredible, five-minute opening shot following Bond as he makes his way through the Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico City. It's a stunning visual coup, unprecedented for the series or in any other similar action film of recent years, and announces that Mendes, after making 'Skyfall' (2012), is still interested in innovating within what has become a venerable British institution.Craig, reprising his role for the fourth (and it has been hinted, final) time, looks more relaxed and at ease as Bond than ever before. While still cutting a gaunt, serious figure, he can also handle the script's wry sense of humour: this is truly the funniest Bond in decades. He's ably supported by an impressive cast: Ralph Fiennes (as M), Ben Whishaw (playing Q) and Naomie Harris (Ms Moneypenny), making for an excellent recurring cast, while Léa Seydoux, Monica Bellucci and Christoph Waltz are very fine. Waltz in particular, relishes his villainous role, bringing a gleeful wickedness to his character. He lacks the visceral impact of Javier Bardem in 'Skyfall', but his performance deserves to propel him into the upper echelons of Bond villains.Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is superb, matching Roger Deakins' work on 'Skyfall' by taking a very different approach: shooting on film, van Hoytema brings a sophisticated, classical elegance, capturing the blazing light of Morocco and the shadowy, diffused look of Rome. One of Mendes' key legacies during his tenure as director of the series will be how elegant photography defines both of his films.That's not to say, however, it's a perfect film. It lacks the delicious surprise 'Skyfall' provided, uprooting so many of our assumptions of what a Bond film was; 'Spectre' is far more deliberately traditional. Worse, the screenplay, by John Logan, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth, introduces a subplot about the potential closure of MI6. While it helps make the film feel very contemporary, the chief component, Max Denbigh (played by Andrew Scott), is disastrously underwritten and frankly, uninteresting, lengthening an already long film. The script also, mystifyingly, constructs a two-part climax which feels unnecessary. It under-utilises a fascinating location in favour of an overly-familiar one and try as Mendes might, he can't pull the broken-backed finale off.Still, Thomas Newman's score is an improvement over his music for 'Skyfall', introducing John Barry-esque strings and horns, while Mendes displays his panache as an action director with a number of thrilling sequences. It's a ferociously entertaining, unrelenting film, and questions of plausibility aside, it's a high watermark for the James Bond series.",8,26,49,16 November 2015
