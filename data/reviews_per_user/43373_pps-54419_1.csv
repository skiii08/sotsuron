Hereditary," Exorcist of our generation? I think not!
","Can't believe most of the reviews on here raving about how scary this film is. Spent a whole 1:45 waiting for something scary to happen, and then the first real scary scene just gave me a solid chuckle. Probably one of the more overrated movies out there. That said, there are some beautiful cinematic shots, but they don't make up for the comical writing. Don't see this if you actually want to be scared!!",5,3,7,16 June 2018
