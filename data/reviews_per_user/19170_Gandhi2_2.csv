Source Code," Well Thought Out Sci-Fi Thriller
","Another film by Duncan Jones...... Let me re-phrase that - another first-rate classic from Duncan Jones.A man awakens in disarray and cannot understand what is happening, a good-looking woman talking to him - she calls him Sean, he corrects her, stating his name is Air Force Captain Colter Stevens....from there his mission starts, although he discovers more once the train explodes and he is drawn, via quantum mechanics and parabolic arcs, back into the future, namely later that day. There he is ensconced in a metal all-surrounding cell with a face on a screen issuing instructions (Captain Goodwin) - before being sent back to 7.40am that morning!Confusing? No, the story opens itself relatively easily and progresses at a fast pace, taking the viewer along the same path as Captain Stevens, taking the woman (Christina Warren) along with him in a vain effort to save her whilst trying to succeed in stopping that days disaster.The photography is stunning, showing a city and its environs, transportation links and countryside in clean, crisp images, offset by the dark, crowded, cramped, almost dingy interior of the Source Code Headquarters.I smiled at the ring tone of Christina's phone - I guess Duncan Jones has a thing about that song; I am sure Mr Hawks will be smiling too!Twists and turns occur, misleading the viewer into a thought process, before veering into another, during another eight minute intrusion into the past. All in all the satisfaction felt comes from figuring out as Captain Stevens does what the inventor of Source Code (Dr. Rutledge) cannot know. The end is a perfect conclusion to a great film. Thoroughly recommended and worth every point of ten out of ten. I sense greater things for Duncan Jones and look forward eagerly to watching his career unfold. Please let every film be as good if not better....",10,1,5,1 April 2011
Moon," Absolutely one of the all-time greats!
","I went along with great expectations for this independent sci-fi film - having read the reviews online and in several publications, drawn up some idea of the concept and background, noted that it was by Duncan Jones......all these thoughts whirling in my mind as I took my seat in the cinema.Nothing - repeat, nothing - can prepare you for this movie.Yes - compare it to 2001, or Solaris, or any other great pedantic sci-fi film. Yes - marvel at what has been achieved for so small a budget ($5 million).But....this film left me awestruck. It takes you up and involves you from start to finish, never exploding into mindless violence or loud fiery explosions. It shows just how a single person (if you could call Sam Bell that) is affected after near three years of isolation on the dark side of the moon; how the big corporation milks the small man (possible dig at the big studios????) until that person can no longer operate in a normal, day-to-day fashion; how the progression of the human race can actually be backtracking at times.Do we not all lose a little of ourselves with each passing year? Imagine doing that when all of a sudden you discover that you are not who you think you are and the only honesty emanates (eventually) from your only companion in that isolation, an A.I. unit.The scope of the whole film remains small but the greater aspect of its message is huge - as at the end when Sam has to decide between himself (!!) what to do for the greater good whilst also wanting to be reunited with his family.....which still turns out to throw up greater questions back on Earth.I was blown away by just how thought-provoking the film was. And yet it presented the future with that great 'retro' feel, that sums up many a great era of film, as Sam Bell repeats the same processes, the same daily grind, holding on to the thought of finally meeting his baby girl..I thoroughly recommend this film to any person with even a minor interest in film - yes, go watch your big blockbusters, but to see a truly great film, MOON wins hands down every time.Given nine out of ten for this - there are a couple of noticeable slips and errors but they do not detract from great storytelling.",9,2,3,6 August 2009
