It," Disappointing. Not scary.
","As a huge fan of the horror genre, I had eagerly anticipated watching this movie and had high hopes regarding its quality. Unfortunately, it disappointed me greatly - pun intended. My main point of contention with this movie is the glaring plot holes:
<ul><li>Did all the floating children come back to life at the end?</li><li>What happened to Georgie? Is he gone forever?</li><li>Why don't the bullies ever address that their friend has gone missing? </li><li>Why do the bullies hate the Losers' Club so much?</li><li>Who does Beverly like? I'm confused as to why she kisses both Bill and Ben... </li><li>Why does Pennywise use the sewage system if he can manifest wherever he chooses?</li><li>Where are the kids' parents whenever they disappear to fight Pennywise?</li><li>Does Pennywise actually eat his victims? If yes, why are they floating?</li></ul>In addition to being left with these burning questions, my other major issue with 'It' is the lack of character development. I found myself not caring about any of the characters because I felt that I knew very little about them. The movie provides almost no back story on the characters. For instance, I wonder about Henry's relationship with his father and whether or not that contributes to his sadistic behaviour. The camaraderie between the Losers also raises questions. It doesn't make sense that Beverly, Ben, and Mike instantly bond with the Losers just seconds after meeting them. They're literally strangers to one another, yet they risk their lives to protect each other - how unbelievable! In summary, the movie does not deserve all the praise it's receiving in my opinion. A sequel is said to be released in the future; hopefully it'll be an improvement. In the meantime, I'm going to read the original novel and hope that it'll fill in all the gaps for me.",5,0,0,23 December 2017
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Beautiful, emotional
","Wow. This movie put me on an emotional rollercoaster. It was beautiful in many ways.First, the plot was incredibly creative - kudos to the writer! I'd never seen or read a story similar to this one, so it was definitely refreshing. I must, however, warn you that this story is not a happy one; it's honestly heartbreaking in my opinion. I greatly empathized with Benjamin and the pain that he experienced from having his unique disease. From being abandoned as a baby and missing out on a normal 'growing up' phase, to losing Daisy and his opportunity for fatherhood, Benjamin's life seemed overall quite sad. The two leading cast members, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, both did a great job portraying their characters. Pitt, in particular, did an outstanding job. I think he was perfectly convincing as the kind-hearted Benjamin. I also give props to the amazing costumes and sets used in this movie. It was evident that a lot of hard work and care was put into making these aspects really shine.While this movie had a lot of great aspects, it also had a few shortcomings. First, I was disappointed that Daisy never explained why she had rejected Benjamin in Paris; she never even apologized for her cruelty, which I think is something which needed to be addressed. Second, I found it odd that not many people were questioning Benjamin's disease. It was never explicitly addressed by anyone (except for Benjamin, I guess).Overall, however, this movie is a great one, and I'd definitely recommend it!",8,0,0,7 April 2018
Black Panther," Good, but not amazing
","As a big fan of Marvel movies, I had been patiently awaiting Black Panther's release for several months. I finally got the chance to watch it this week, and I was honestly a bit disappointed. While the movie was entertaining, it was not extraordinary. First, the plot was quite predictable and cliche - an unsurprising story of revenge and political strife. Second, I felt that the character development overall was weak, particularly that of the villain. While the movie addressed the villain's motive for revenge against T'Challa, it barely explained why he thought Wakanda should change their political system. I honestly just couldn't connect to his character because it wasn't believable enough. Third, the movie relied much too heavily on cuts, and it had many poorly lit scenes that were basically impossible to see.On the plus side, Black Panther had a fairly strong cast. I was impressed with their performances, particularly that of Danai Gurira. In addition, the costumes and setting were beautifully executed - more so than the average Marvel movie. Overall, I'd still recommend Marvel fans see this movie, but don't set your expectations too high.",7,0,1,3 March 2018
