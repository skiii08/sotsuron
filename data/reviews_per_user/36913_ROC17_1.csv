Scarface," A solid film
","This movie has it's flaws, but it makes up for those flaws in pure entertainment, and shock appeal.  I'm not much of a Brian De Palma fan, and I think this movie is far and away his best.  Pacino is extaoridinary, some say he overeacts here, but thats what such a larger than life persona needed.  About 3/4's of the way through the movie, I thought it was getting steadily worse, and was starting to get bored with it........Then came the ending.  Easily one of the best guns fights in film history.  'Say hello to my little friend!'  I usually don't get excited about scenes like this, but it is just plain cool.  How can you beat Al Pacino, Coked up out of his mind, with a machine gun, taking on about 40 guys?  You can't.  I gave the film ***1/2 out of ****.  If you feel like being enertained, and seeing the best damn gun fight EVER, watch this film.  If you are easily offended, an an artsy type, i doubt you will appreciate Pacino's work here.",Null,0,1,15 April 2003
