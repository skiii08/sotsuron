The Legend of Bagger Vance," Too bad the screenwriter was there to see the audiences' reaction
","Yesterday, I had the opportunity to see the movie on my campus.  This movie is one that I would not recommend for any college aged audience.  The serious scenes cause the crowd to laugh with glee.  The plot was predictable from the beginning.  Matt Damon's character experienced the traditional transition of drunk to golfer back to drunk and finally to victorious golfer...zzzzzz.  Will Smith should have been killing aliens in this movie, cause it needed SOMETHING to speed it up.  Even the golf balls moved slow. One scene involved Matt Damon planning out his shot and you see the sunset and the clouds move.  I was waiting to see the seasons change before he made his shot.",1,4,10,27 October 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," dark,mysterious,mediocre ending
",I thought the movie was very good.  The mood and the darkness of the insanity nearly drove me insane.  I was trapped into this little world until the end.  Unfortunately the ending got a little sentimental and thus lost some of the momentum that was built,9,0,1,13 January 2000
