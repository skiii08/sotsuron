The Rock," Cage and Connery at their best
","OK, the premise is just a little wacky. Nickolas Cage, with the assistance of Sean Connery are going to bust into Alcatraz to stop some crazy general from destroying civilization. Well, that's a little exaggerated, but that's the basic idea. The General (Ed Harris) has some nasty stuff that only Cage can neutralize, but he needs Connery's assistance to get into Alcatraz to do the job. Connery is some British spy that once escaped from Alcatraz and is locked up in a secret prison because he has information on our government, including who killed Kennedy. That would have been very helpful to Oliver Stone in the making of JFK.The premise is wild, but Cage and Connery are rocking and the supporting cast is a beauty, including the ever-lovely Claire Forlani and the ever-evil John Spenser. Enjoy.",8,3,4,17 March 2007
The Double Life of Véronique," What else do you want to know about me?
","One does not have to get into the existential meaning behind this film to truly enjoy it.It concerns two women, Weronika and Véronique, both played by Irene Jacob (Three Colors: Red). They never quite meet, although their paths almost cross one day as Véronique is photographing a protest while leaving on a bus, and Weronika sees her - her double. One lives in France, and the other in Poland. They were born on the same day. They have the same heart problems. They are both superb singers. One dies, the other doesn't.The outstanding performance by Irène Jacob, who plays both Weronika and Véronique; the amazingly colorful cinematography by Oscar nominee (Black Hawk Down)Slawomir Idziak; and the absolutely sumptuous score by Golden Globe nominee (Three Colors: Blue, At Play in the Fields of the Lord) Zbigniew Preisner all make Oscar nominee (Three Colors: Red) Krzysztof Kieslowski's film the experience of a lifetime.But, to get the true measure of the film, you have to devote some time and effort in watching. It is not a passive exercise like some Hollywood shoot em up. It is a film with depth and meaning. It is spiritual, maybe even religious, and will have serious viewers finding something to discuss for a long time.",8,0,0,12 August 2010
"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," I can lose weight... but you'll always be an arsehole!
","Now, it is completely puzzling why anyone would leave Thandie Newton at the altar, but Dennis (Simon Pegg) did it. Now, five years later, he is a loser and Libby (Newton) has a new man, Whit (Hank Azaria).As expected, the laughs come in rapid fire as Dennis tries to compete with Whit. He is assisted in his quest by his best friend, Gordon (Dylan Moran), and his landlord, Mr. G (Harish Patel). In fact the only movie that was funnier in 2007 was another Pegg comedy, Hot Fuzz.Pegg gives his own version of Rocky training for the big match and it is hilarious! David Schwimmer was excellent in his film directorial debut. Somebody needs to give India de Beaufort more movie roles as she was fascinating in her short appearance as Mr. G's daughter.It was sweet and tender and inspiring, as well as funny.",7,0,1,26 April 2009
The Devil's Advocate," A hell of a good movie
","Pacino is over the top in his characterization of the devil in this film. You really believe, I mean really believe that you are seeing Satan himself. I never get tired of watching this performance.He has a great supporting cast here with Keanu Reeves as a lawyer that will do anything to win. But, Kevin (Reeves) was bush league. He met John (Pacino) and learned what it meant to 'do anything' to win. There are some interesting twists here that make the movie so much more interesting. I wouldn't want to spoil them for you.Also, the movie has the luscious Charlize Theron as Kevin's wife. Needless to say she has to be removed for John's plans to come to pass. It's not pretty! Connie Nielsen and Tamara Tunie add their exquisite beauty to the mix and make the journey so much more enjoyable.Does Kevin go over to the Dark Side? I'll never tell.",7,1,2,25 April 2007
The King's Speech," Because I have a right to be heard. I have a voice!
","I never miss an opportunity to see Helena Bonham Carter. As Queen Elizabeth, she was fantastic. I also like Timothy Spall. He made a great Winston Churchhill.That being said, the film is about events surrounding King George VI (Colin Firth) and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech teacher.It was a compelling story of love and war and a reluctant King.The struggle between King and teacher went far beyond the surface until a friendship developed that allowed Lionel (Rush) to get King George through the most difficult days England has ever faced.Worth watching over and over.",9,1,6,2 June 2011
Whip It," I like smart girls. That's why I married your mama. Well, that and I knocked her up.
","The first thing I noticed that peaked my interest, aside from the title and the subject matter, was the cast and director.I love Drew Barrymore, and she was not only in this film, but the film's director. This definite means my time will not be wasted.Aside from Barrymore, we have Ellen Page, Kristen Wiig, Juliette Lewis, and Zoe Bell. There is also Marcia Gay Harden, who might give us another great bible quoting character like she did in The Mist.It was way too predictable, but that didn't take too much away from the enjoyment. Page was great, as was Wiig and Lewis. Harden played a great role, as did Daniel Stern as her father, Earl. Alia Shawkat is one I want to see more of.An enjoyable end to the week.",7,5,9,21 May 2010
Angels & Demons," Open the doors, and tell the world the truth.
","Despite the fact that it was nominated for a Teen Choice Award, it is a movie worth watching.The mixture of myth and pseudo-history, and criticism of Catholic Church mistakes makes for a fascinating story while they chase the terrorists through Rome.Finding the first Cardinal was particularly gruesome.Hanks runs hither and yon trying to find the remaining three cardinals before they are killed and a bomb is set off in the Vatican. What do you bet he is successful in finding the bomb? We can have the Vatican blow up, can we? Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, and Stellan Skarsgård all played their parts well and made this film interesting.I just hope Hanks makes another one. He is perfect as Robert Langdon.",7,0,2,1 December 2009
The Legend of Bagger Vance," What a waste of time.
","I don't know how I got sucked into this schmaltzy film. O poor Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon). Who names their child Rannulph? No wonder he is such a loser! He just can't get his stick up and needs help from Bagger Vance. Man, if you can't get it up for Charlize Theron, you might as well just quit. This movie was so slow, I played a round of golf and still finished before he did. No wonder books like 'The Secret' are selling. People believe this drivel and think that some magic will make them a champion and help them get the girl. get over it. Golf, and getting the girl both take work, not magic Well, it did have Charlize, so it was not a total waste of time.",5,1,4,20 April 2007
Vertigo," One final thing I have to do... and then I'll be free of the past.
",Oscar ignored this fantastic film by Hitchcock starring James Stewart. It gave nomination for Art and Set decoration and Sound. Small acknowledgment of an outstanding film.James Stewart was outstanding as a detective that was duped by his 'friend (Tom Helmore).' We were all led on an adventure that made absolutely no sense until we were shown the result. This film really had me going! Kim Novak was also excellent in her role as the wife. She was so good that I had no idea that she was anything more than object of Stewart's obsession. Hitchcock had me going her also.This was an excellent movie and should have had more recognition.,9,10,12,7 February 2008
Changeling," I used to tell Walter, 'Never start a fight... but always finish it.' I didn't start this fight... but by God, I'm going to finish it.
","Barely two weeks after Christine Collins' (Angelina Jolie)son Walter disappears, the Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) is raging against the Los Angeles police department in his church and on the radio. We quickly realize that things in 1928 are not good in the City of Angels.What is going on? Why is Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) so adamant that the boy they found is Walter Collins? Can't they believe a mother knows her own son? Angelina Jolie is beyond fantastic in this film. She plays the distraught, then doubtful/angry mother to perfection.When the LAPD is faced with an embarrassing situation, we see just how corrupt they, and the animals that run the County psychiatric facility, are.Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) discovers what really happened, and, despite the efforts of Capt. Jones, manages to reveal the horror. With the help of Rev. Briegleb, she gets a pro bono lawyer (Geoffrey Pierson) and all hell breaks loose.The cinematography was outstanding and added to the overall feeling of the period. The screenplay, the sound, the costumes, and Clint Eastwood's direction were all superb.Jason Butler Harner was absolutely perfect as the slime-ball that was only marginally worse than the police and the staff of the psychiatric facility.Angelina Jolie. I rest my case.",9,4,5,19 February 2009
Come and See," The horror
","Come and see the devastation of war, not only upon countries, but upon children.WWII is a time when Florya (Alekseyow Kravchenko) is growing up and he is forced to grow as a witness and participant in one of mankind's greatest atrocities.The horrors of war have seldom been displayed as they have here. There is no hope, no possibility of escape. Genocide and murder reigns,and you just wait your turn.Florya discovers his whole family killed, he loses his hearing to the shelling, and he is forced to deal with terror that even adults should not see.This film will not excite you with zippy dialog and fancy stars. It is about was, and there is nothing zippy or fancy about it.",8,1,1,26 August 2010
Scarface," A mountain of excess
","There is so much on the surface of this movie that it is difficult to get to the real story.I didn't count the number of times that Tony Montana (Pacino) uses the work f*ck or motherf*cker, but I do not believe there is another movie out there that tops it. I have heard that after 20 years, The Devil's Rejects may now have the title, but I haven't seen that, The violence is over the top also. The shower scene with the chain saw is most memorable, but the end is also bloody.Drug use? I have never seen a mountain of coke like the one on Tony's desk. he literally wallowed in it.But, underneath all of that, there is a story of a man who was a loser. A man who did everything to the extremes to hide the fact that he was so shallow and a failure. His relationships, if you could call them that, we superficial. His mother knew the truth. Apparently, she was the only one.I highly recommend watching this movie on broadcast TV after you see it on DVD. Without all the language, you can see some of the real story that makes this Pacino's greatest film.",8,0,1,25 April 2007
Frost_Nixon," That's our tragedy, you and I Mr. Frost. No matter how high we get, they still look down at us.
","As I look down the list of Ron Howard films, I find one guilty pleasure (Ransom), but nothing that equals the achievement of this film. With Frost/Nixon, Howard has joined the ranks of the great directors. He has made a film that is truly superb. While I still tend to prefer The Reader over this film, it is definitely worthy of many awards.As to the acting Oscar, it will be extremely hard to find someone more worthy that Frank Langella. He WAS Richard Nixon in this film, and his performance is what will make it memorable. I want to see it again just to see him.Oliver Platt is always enjoyable, and was so here. Kevin Bacon was magnificent, too. He was certainly more deserving of a nomination than anyone from Tropic Thunder.Despite the fine acting performance, I found myself walking out thinking about Rebecca Hall. I have seen her once before, but I did not remember her. I will not make that mistake again.A truly memorable experience on all counts.",9,2,4,25 January 2009
Walk the Line," Another drugged-out country singer
","All the good movies are playing in Orlando, and I really don't like driving in there due to the traffic and the time, so I generally wait until I can get them on Video.Last night I watched 'Walk the Line' with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. Reese won so many awards for her performance that it probably got embarrassing accepting them. She probably had to build a new wing on her house to store them. Joaquin did win a Golden Globe, but that was it. I liked him better as the evil Commodus in 'Gladiator.' Reese was absolutely outstanding, as I knew she would be. I really haven't liked the films she has done before this, but I always liked her acting. It really made the film worth watching.Having said that, I must say that you have seen it all before - music star gets hooked on drugs and alcohol and is saved by an angel. Well, not entirely. I had no idea that Johnny Cash sang alongside Elvis, the Killer, and Carl Perkins. They all toured together in the 50's. This film is about Cash's early years - up to the time he married June Carter - and he was definitely rockabilly - no country at all. In that respect, it was very interesting, and I will watch it again.",8,2,4,7 July 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The worst movie I've ever seen. NOT!
","I cannot remember where I first saw Rhona Mitra, but I knew I wanted to see much more of her. That is why I watched Ali G Indahouse. Big mistake! Even Rhona could not make that film worth watching.I never looked at Sacha Cohen again. There was nothing that he could do that would interest me. However, when I saw him win a Golden Globe and saw this film nominated for an Oscar, I knew I had to watch in the interest of finding out what the interest was.I did not laugh one time during the film. Not once. I do not find his demeaning of women, Jews,gays and others to be one bit funny. Yes, I know he is a Jew, and I know it is satire, but there are limits. he crossed those limits and it diminished the film and it diminished him. For the Golden Globes to put him in the same class as Aaron Eckhart or Johnny Depp is beyond my comprehension.Yes, the concept was good, the performances worthwhile, and the satire was excellent, but I just can't get over the subject matter and I do not like potty humor. I just feel that this film has no place at an awards show.",6,1,6,11 March 2007
Alien 3," Don't be afraid, I'm part of the family.
","You just can't kill that sucker and now it has Ripley.I have to admit that this is not the best of the three I have seen. There were no weapons to fight the beast, so they had to chase it through a maze until they could trap it and annihilate it. That plan did not seem to be going well at all, as the scum-of-the-earth prisoners kept getting eaten.Basically, Riply (Sigourney Weaver) and Dillon (Charles Dutton) have to fight this bugger themselves. Dutton was fantastic and made the movie worth watching.Fantastic sound and, of course, marvelous monster effects, and I really thought the reanimation of the android to be especially creepy.",7,4,15,8 July 2007
The Incredible Hulk," Don't make me hungry. You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry.
","I'm not a comic book fan, but everyone knows The Hulk. You don't need to love comics to appreciate this movie.Now, it was an uncredited Robert Downey Jr. that drew me to the flick, but I was not disappointed in what I saw from Edward Norton (American History X, Primal Fear).Liv Tyler, who doesn't get the credit she deserves, was great as the former girlfriend. When they met after a long absence, it was like Garance and Baptiste all over again.William Hurt was you typical military officer - all mission and no feelings. Even his own daughter (Tyler) wouldn't talk about him. He was excellent in the role.Man, Tim Roth was perfect! Tim Blake Nelson was an über Geek, and a real delight.The special effects were tremendous. bring on Hulk II.",8,2,3,10 May 2009
Mission: Impossible III," Do you think I'm playing?
","The action, the special effects, the sound: all of these make this one of the most exciting movies that I have watched.But, what really makes this film are the stars: Of course, there is Ving Rhames (Mission: Impossible III ), who I always enjoy; There is Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead, Grindhouse); and there is Philip Seymour Hoffman (Capote), who plays just about one of the baddest criminals in the movies. He was terrifying when he just whispered. Wow! I would be remiss if I did not mention the other great features of this movie: Sasha Alexander, who I miss so much from NCIS; Bellamy Young, who also did an episode of NCIS, as well as CSI: Miami; Bahar Soomekh (Crash); Maggie Q, who we will see again in Live Free or Die Hard; and Michelle Monaghan (North Country, The Bourne Supremacy).What a collection of talent.",8,0,2,19 May 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," There is no 'they...' I did this to you. Me.
","Wow! I felt like I discovered an unknown gem of a movie. I have heard about the film, but no details come to mind. How it escaped my radar is a mystery as it has some of my favorite stars and some surprising performances.First, Lucy Liu (Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Charlie's Angels) gave what I consider the best performance of her career. She was absolutely adorable and really made this film entertaining.Her performance, combined with Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor, Black Hawk Down), someone I never paid any attention to in the past, made me think that this was something of a comedy. Harnett played the mistaken identity to perfection and was cool and funny.You always had to wonder what was going on with Bruce Willis in the shadows. It was driving me nuts. But then the direction changes and you know it is not a comedy but a revenge movie and your jaw drops at the cleverness with which this film was made.Big Kudos to director Paul McGuigan, an unknown to me, but who is working on a film version of one of my favorite old TV shows, The Equalizer; and to writer Jason Smilovic.With those already mentioned and Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Stanley Tucci, this film is worth everyone's time and a must see. The story is phenomenal!",8,4,8,12 January 2008
3:10 to Yuma," For a one-leg rancher... he's one tough son of a bitch.
","I really hate remakes. They take a good foreign film and put in some WB stars and it is never as good as the original. Even The Departed, with a stellar cast list. was not as good as Infernal Affairs. So, I really didn't expect a lot from a remake of a great western, even though I am a Christian Bale fan and really wanted this to be good.It was not only, good, but it was spectacular and I expect to watch it several times. Bale was in the best form of his career as a farmer trying to keep things together for his family. I could easily see everyman in his character, and he played it masterfully.Russell Crowe was also the best I have seen him since Gladiator. He really played a much more nuanced character than I could have imagined, and I really enjoyed the ending where this nuance came out strongly.Ben Foster was born for the role of Charlie Prince. He was as evil as evil gets and made you cringe every time he appeared to see what he would do next.All of this suggests that director James Mangold had a tight rein on this film and delivered what will go down as a western classic.The screenwriters, Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt, and Derek Haas brilliantly turned Elmore Leonard's story into a compelling tale that had a lot of the flavor of the original, but was different in areas that mattered. They really did remake a film that was as good, if not better that the 1957 version.",9,3,7,17 April 2008
The Hangover," Now remember, what happens in Vegas stays, in Vegas... Except herpes, that shite will come back with you.
","There isn't anyone in this movie that I would ever say I wanted to see in a movie. The entire cast is completely unknown, so I can't have any preconceptions.Of course, it did get a lot of Teen Choice nominations, which would make it a movie I wouldn't go near except it may possibly make it on the expanded Best Picture list next year, so I have to sorta watch it.The funniest parts of the movie were the supporting cast: the wedding chapel manager, the cops (Ken Jeong & Cleo King), the doctor (Matt Walsh), the naked Japanese guy, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), the tiger. There was not one funny moment involving the main characters except for the escape in the cop car.",6,1,4,3 October 2009
Marie Antoinette," Royalty gone wild
","Having had the privilege of seeing Versailles first hand, I was expecting a sumptuous feast and was not disappointed. Winning an Oscar for costumes, I cannot understand why it was not also a winner for art direction and makeup, but it did go up against Pan's Labyrinth.Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, it was an ambitious undertaking, and certainly to be criticized by historical purists, who think all movies should be documentaries if they dabble with facts. Just as book lovers expect all movies to be faithful renditions of their beloved tomes.I am sure Coppola played loose with the facts, but presented an engaging story of two young royals that were not prepared to lead. Whether spending time hunting or gambling, they were more interested in the pursuit of fun than the problems of France. At least they spent some of that money helping the American rebels throw off the English.Besides Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette, I certainly enjoyed Rip Torn as a randy Loius XV, who had a torrid affair with the lovely Comtesse du Barry (Asia Argento).",7,1,3,9 March 2008
The Ring," Everyone will suffer - but not you.
","So, I guess I'll be getting a phone call soon saying I have seven days to live as i watched the movie within this movie.I have to admit that Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, POTC 2, POTC 3, The Weatherman) and Ehren Kruger (Reindeer Games) certainly kept me interested for the entire length of this film, which is not surprising given their credits.The premise was a little weird, but Naomi Watts (King Kong) kept my attention as she tried to solve the mystery.That bathroom suicide was amazing, as was the horse on the ferry. Great stuff.I have Ring Two ready to watch, so we'll see if Noami can keep it up.",6,0,1,20 July 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," You want to see it opened as well as I. Indiana, we are simply passing through history. This, this *is* history.
","This is the big one - four Oscars for sets, editing, sound, and effects, and four more nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Cinematography and John Williams music. They just don't make them like this anymore.Harrison Ford was at the top of his game here as Indiana Jones. You could believe that he was the greatest adventurer of them all.Karen Allen was a perfect partner, and I am so glad they are bringing her back in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.I thoroughly enjoyed John Rhys-Davies and he added immensely to the film.This is just pure entertainment as the excitement never let up for a second, and the ending was simply spectacular.",9,0,2,10 May 2008
Spartacus," A good body with a dull brain is as cheap as life itself.
","This Stanle Kubrick classic appears to have it all. The set decoration, cinematography and costuming are all superior. Also excellent was the editing, score, and, of course, the direction by Kubrick.The cast was superlative. Kirk Douglas (Lust for Life, The Bad and the Beautiful, Champion) as Sparticus really gave us an outstanding performance as the man who took on Rome. Not until Gibson gave us William Wallace do we see a champion of the people fighting for freedom.We cannot neglect mentioning Laurence Olivier as Crassius, Jean Simmons as Varinia, Peter Ustinov as Batiatus, and Woody Strode (The Quick and the Dead) as Draba.The restored version of this film goes 3 and a half hours. I guess sitting through Grindhouse wasn't so bad after all. If a film is good, then the time flies by.",9,1,3,9 June 2007
United 93," Not the same story
","I remember when this film came out that many people were saying it may be too early for this subject. I kept asking if they lived under a rock because there had already been a British/US movie, a British documentary, and an Emmy-winning US TV movie the previous year. What else could they possibly say about the subject that hadn't already been said.Well, I was very surprised at this film. I really liked the way it concentrated on the control towers and the FAA and the military and the confusion that was going on. You could see the horror on the faces of these people as they saw the second plane hit the tower. You could see the confusion as they tried to figure out what was happening. It made for some very dramatic and compelling viewing.Paul Greengrass kept this story moving even though things were happening in several places at once. It never dragged for a second.You know it had to be great to keep me up til 1 am.",8,0,2,18 April 2007
Deja Vu," I need more cowbell!
","Outstanding! One of the best science fiction films I have seen in a while. This was a winner! OK, enough with the tag lines. I was just inspired after seeing this film. Denzel Washington has given his best performances since Man on Fire.The movie starts out like it is going to be a Lincolyn Rhyme police procedural. That would be OK with me as I liked Denzel in that role. But then it goes off into the space/time continuum and theoretical physicals. Hang on to your hats because this is heavy stuff. No, you really don't need to understand it to follow, but it sure is interesting.Add the usual car chase - Denzel in a hummer chasing a car on a bridge; crashing into several vehicles and sending cars flying in its narrow path - and explosions and firework and you have a thriller with a twist.Paula Patton (Idlewid, London) is definitely one to keep an eye on. Up next in a horror flick with Kiefer Sutherland.Spoiler: Jesus is the bad guy.Have to watch this one again soon!",8,2,4,7 October 2007
Finding Neverland," Just a dog? *Just*? What a horrible candle-snuffing word.
","I am in a Johnny Depp mood at the moment. Three in a row according to my current schedule.How could I have missed this film that was nominated for over 70 awards, winning 17, including an Oscar? Well, I fixed that today.Was there supposed to be something salacious going on between Sir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp) and the four boys? If so, it was not evident.Despite the fact that their grandmother (Julie Christie) had her nose up in the air over his playing with the children, it was apparently just his way of having fun and looking for an idea for a play.Kate Winslet was fantastic as the children's mother, who was trying to hide her sickness from the boys due to the fact that already had to deal with the death of their father.Of course, his wife (Radha Mitchell) did not like the idea that he was spending so much time with the children and their mother.Of course the art direction and the sets were stupendous, and Depp was as brilliant as I have ever seen him.The addition of the orphans to the audience was, as Dustin Hoffman said, genius.This movie was just pure magic.",9,0,0,10 August 2009
Lifeboat," Dying together's even more personal than living together.
","This film got Hitchcock an Oscar nomination and it was well deserved. Tallulah Bankhead got an award from the New York Film Critics for her role in this John Steinbeck story about survivors on a lifeboat.There was an eclectic mix of characters with a German Captain, an American who changed his German name, a multi-millionaire, a typical New York character, and two from the South side of Chicage, a girl and a guy who find love on the boat, and one black character. You can imagine the stories and conflict in that as they float on the sea.Hitcock did a create job keeping things moving and the film never dragged as they awaited rescue. Cinematography was excellent. Great cast and an interesting look at how people react without food or water.",8,4,5,13 September 2007
In Bruges," Ray, you are about the worst tourist in the whole world.
","You cannot say much about this film without giving it away, and I wouldn't dare do that as it is so full of surprises that everyone should see it.It so reminded me of Crete. I spent two years there and visited all the Minoan sites. Of course, all the tourists go to Knossos, and my wife didn't mind that as it is partially reconstructed, but the other four were a real pain to her. One is way on top of a mountain that is accessible only by a one lane dirt road. All the time you are going up, you hope a bus isn't coming down. You finally get there and you see the site as it is - a 5000-year-old, unreconstructed site. In my wife's description, 'We climbed up here to see a pile of rocks!' It is exactly how Ray (Colin Farrell) felt when sent to Bruges with his partner, Ken (Brendan Gleeson). Ken, like me, of course liked the sites. The banter between the two is priceless. Martin McDonagh not only directed a winner, he wrote some of the best dialog that I have heard in a long time. Imagine a Hugh Grant film with hit men. Well, he did one of those, didn't her, but this was far superior.And, it has Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) in a very un-Harry Potter-like role. She was really great.There are so many great characters in this film, and some great actors, too, like Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient, Schindler's List, and two Harry Potters).This is definitely a don't miss.",9,3,7,25 June 2008
Monty Python's Life of Brian," I think it was 'Blessed are the cheesemakers'.
","I have to say that I am a huge fan of John Cleese. I have watched Fawlty Towers many times and bust my gut every time I see it.That said, he is not the prime reason I watched this film. I was drawn to the fact that it is considered one of the most, if not the most controversial film of all time. John Cleese was just icing on the cake.The laughs come fast and furious in this film. This is the biggest collection of nitwits I have ever seen, and the spacemen in the middle was totally unexpected! The laughs never stop in this comedy. I don't know why it is considered sacrilegious as there were a lot of prophets at the time, and there was no real mention of the other guy. Some people just need to lighten up and enjoy a parody that never really steps over the line.",8,1,5,15 July 2009
Erin Brockovich," Do they teach beauty queens to apologize? Because you suck at it!
","Sure everyone talks about this film as probably the best of Julia Robert's stellar career (We'll forget Hook and Mary Reilly ). She won an Oscar and an armload of other awards in her role as a mom struggling to overcome her trailer park background and put food in the mouths of her babes. It was a superior strong woman role and she was a real pleasure to watch, as she always is.Traffic and Sex, Lies and Videope director Steven Soderbergh put together another beauty of a show for our enjoyment. He also has an armload of awards.But, the real star of this film is Ed Masry played brilliantly by Albert Finney (Amazing Grace, Murder on the Orient Express, The Dresser, Tom Jones, Under the Volcano). Ed Masry provided the comic element in this film and kept things moving along. Finney was absolutely brilliant in the role.",8,0,1,9 May 2007
Se7en," Yeah, a landlord's dream: a paralyzed tenant with no tongue.
","There is no one who could argue against the fact that if you put Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey together in a film, it is going to be a hit.I have watched countless hours of murder mysteries in movies and TV and have read innumerable books, and there is no finer murder/serial killer story than this one.It has every element that one would look for in this type of story and it delivers with a punch to the gut that is visceral and lasting.This is one of those films that you can watch countless times and never tire of.",9,2,3,10 October 2008
I'm Not There," People actually think I have some kind of a fantastic imagination. It gets very lonesome.
","I was thrilled by Todd Haynes work on Glam Rock in Velvet Goldmine, and I looked forward to a film about Robert Allen Zimmerman (possibly a cousin).I was more intrigued about the fact that favs like Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, and Cate Blanchette, and others would be playing different parts of Dylan. Leave it to Haynes to come up with a non-traditional take on this great artist.How else can you show the many sides of an individual than by having different people play the man and expose his artistry. Some may find it difficult as the film bounces from side to side and back and forth with color and greys, but you are rewarded by seeing great performances by Blanchette, Bale, ledger, Richard Gere, and others.For the traditional, there is Martin Scorsese's No Direction Home, but there is also a place for Haynes work on the man.",8,0,0,25 February 2009
The Big Lebowski," Yeah, well. The Dude abides.
","Maude Lebowski: What do you do for recreation? The Dude: Oh, the usual. I bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback. That just about sums up this trip: Some bowling, where we meet one of the most interesting characters I have ever seen in Jesus Quintana (John Turturro), and where The Staranger (Sam Elliott) pops in from time to time to offer such sage advice as. 'Sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes, well, he eats you.'Some driving around in a comedy of errors where John Goodman really shines as Walter Sobchak. With friends like that, you certainly don't need enemies. We also meet really colorful characters like Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore), who just wants The Dude's seed; Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), the porn star turned gold-digger; and, of course, The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) and his faithful servant Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And when Steve Buscemi started talking about the In and Out Burger, I almost lost it. I swore he was going to go into 'the old in and out' routine.A visit to Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) brings about an amazing thing that could only be described as an acid flashback. I have to admit I had my mouth open the whole time it was going on. It was just that incredible.You should get the idea that this is not a film about kidnapping and money and criminals; it was a film about the characters. i only touched on the main ones. There are plenty more interesting gems to find.Only the Coen brothers could have dreamed up the story of a slacker caught up in a bad situation. It was one of the funniest films I have ever seen.",8,2,5,13 August 2007
Fight Club," The things you own end up owning you.
","I wasn't prepared for an existential trip about life. I thought it was just going to be about fighting. I was wrong.The line in my title grabbed me because I have always thought about 'stuff' and how it ties you down. People can't get divorced when the love is gone because of 'stuff.' People can't move to a better location because of 'stuff.' 'Stuff' is choking us all.It is like the Kipling poem: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss;then you will be a man!Besides, 'stuff.' we are chocked by consumerism; which may be the same thing. The film is replete with phallic symbols and decries the femininization of men.'We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.'Fight Club gives us an emphatic NO to that question. But, then, what is Marla's role? To show us that we are lying to ourselves? Hmmm.This film had brilliant performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, under the superb direction of David Fincher. It deserves multiple watchings.",9,2,5,14 October 2007
Monster," Charlize is the real thing!
","I was entranced by Charlize Theron's impersonation of Aileen Wuornos in this film. She carried home an entire shelf full of awards for her performance and she earned every single one of them. The prosthetic makeup that transformed the gorgeous actress into a bedraggled, weather-beaten street person was uncannily good at recreating Wuornos's crooked teeth; and the vocal similarity between the fictional and the actual Aileens was striking.Christina Ricci played an equally impressive part as the rejected lesbian, whom Wuornos latched onto after being abused and rejected by so many others. But this film was all Carlize and she dominated it. She was so convincing that she virtually disappeared and I saw Wuornos back from the dead on the screen. Eiree.",8,1,1,17 March 2007
The Birth of a Nation," Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more.
","It was an epic when it was made, and still a work of art in cinema history.The first part show the 'gentile' South and the war. It was romanticized to the extent that brother was fighting brother, friend was fighting friend, and in meeting during the war, they remained friends. Nice, but probably not accurate. Still, it made for a good story.The second half is filled with controversy as the Carpetbaggers invade the South and establish Black rule that is designed to crush the Whites until the Golden Knights of the Ku Klux Klan save society to live in peace. This is the story as presented, not an interpretation.Despite the historical inaccuracy, it it still a magnificent work with amazing performances by Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh, Henry B. Walthall, George Siegmann, and others. It is hard to believe that words are not needed to display feelings.",8,1,5,5 April 2009
Underworld," Hot without showing a bit of skin
","I really didn't think I would like this film, especially since it got a lousy review and ditto comments, but it really wasn't that bad and I actually watched the whole thing. Yes, I wanted to see Kate Beckinsale. I was thinking about seeing Vacancy and wanted to know if she was worth the price of admission. I was also interested in the comments regarding her doing nudity. Is that her nude in Uncovered or is it a body double? Only the cameraman knows for sure. But that is off topic. This is about Underworld. But, maybe it is on topic, since I would not have watched had I not wanted to see her. She was hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! All covered up and I couldn't take my eyes off her.What was the movie about? Who cares? I just wanted to see Kate. That was enough o not only keep me interested, but to make me want to see the sequel tomorrow night. Beside Kate, both Bill Nighy and Sophia Myles will be back and they are definitely worth seeing again.",7,1,2,20 April 2007
Amistad," An amazing story of history and freedom
","While theatergoers in 1997 were being amazed by special effects on another ship, this magnificent story given to us by the master director Steven Spielberg gives us the true story of our country and what it means to be American.We are not free as long as one of us is in chains. As John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) so eloquently put it, '...what are we to do with that embarrassing, annoying document, The Declaration of Independence? What of its conceits? 'All men created equal,' 'inalienable rights,' 'life, liberty,' and so on and so forth?' The Civil War was, indeed, the last battle of The American Revolution.What a cast! You can search for Fool's Gold or you can watch Matthew McConaughey in her greatest performance as the lawyer who risked it all.Djimon Hounsou may Never Back Down this year, as he certainly didn't in this film.Morgan Freeman certainly knows about 'Freedom: A History of Us' and he helped the Africans find theirs.One of the very best films I have ever seen.",10,36,50,16 February 2008
Kickboxer," This is stone city. Where many ancient warriors come. While you train here, listen!
","It appears that Bolo Yeung (Bloodsport) wasn't enough of a challenge, so Jean-Claude Van Damme sets a match with Tong Po. Of course, he is there to avenge his brother. Hmmm, wasn't he avenging his parents in Double Impact? He is always avenging someone - I think it was another brother (he must have a lot) in Lionheart.The movie is really a yawn unless you have a thing for an hour of looking at Van Damme's rippling muscles on a perfectly formed body shiny with oil.The ring action is so short and predictable that it is a real letdown. I mean, you absolutely knew the match would turn around once his brother appears, didn't you?",5,3,5,29 March 2008
Dawn of the Dead," I am not a horror fan
","I don't usually watch horror films. I have maybe seen three or four. I'm not talking about old Dracula or Frankenstein movies, but the current stuff. This film was so good that even a non fan like myself would enjoy it.The film was tense and action packed throughout. If you like blood, this film had it, but it wasn't gross. If you like tight suspense, then this is the film for you. It changed every second and you never knew where it would end. I'm still not sure about the ending, but I am not hopeful for the four who were left.Ving Rhames was excellent. He was supported by a great cast and each character added something of value to the film.",8,0,2,10 March 2007
Iron Man 2," I'd love to leave my door unlocked at night, but this ain't Canada.
","It was very entertaining, but...I can understand how the realization that you are dying can make everything seem pointless, but it really makes for a depressing start to a movie that is supposed to be an action adventure. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) was really a pain to watch while he whined and made an a** of himself.Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) was reduced to be a complaining CEO as Tony fell apart. It was not a joy to watch.Now, Don Cheadle was great. Scarlett Johansson was hot and kicked butt. Mickey Rourke was perfect for the role of the bad guy.I will look forward to seeing most of these characters return in The Avengers, but I hope they lose the pity party and focus on action.",7,1,2,11 October 2010
Two for the Money," I'm addicted to these stars.
","Walter Abrams: After the therapy, and the psychiatry, and the meetings, you know what it all comes down to? You're all f*cked up.Let's face it. If Al Pacino, Matthew McConaughey, or Rene Russo are in a film, there is a better than even chance that I will be watching it. I'd say an 80% chance. It is not just their acting abilities, but they usually appear in films that are interesting. Adding Carly Pope, who was in the recently seen 1st to Die, and it was a certainty.That is true in this case. The film was a fascinating study of addiction. Not just to gambling, but in the case of Jeremy Piven, to self-importance. Or, in the case of Armand Assante, to power. But, p*ss on him.This film was a roller-coaster ride all the way and just plain enjoyable.",6,0,0,22 October 2007
Alien: Resurrection," Earth, man. What a shithole.
","Amélie director Jean-Pierre Jeunet did a fantastic job and gave us the best Alien film of the lot.I loved the first two, but this was so much more.First, there was the lighting. It may seem trivial to some, but this film was much more enjoyable due to the fact that everything didn't happen in the dark. I do not think the darkness enhances the thrill of the series. The creatures are awesome themselves, and the new creature was magnificent. Seeing them in brilliant lighting made them even more thrilling.Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder were awesome together. They made an almost erotic team and I loved seeing them act. The 'too humane to be human' line was a stroke of genius.I have always liked Gary Dourdan, and he did well in this film - a positive addition to the cast. And, no one could have done General Perez better than Dan Hedaya.Really enjoyed this one!",10,12,22,14 July 2007
12 Monkeys," I'm looking for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
","Take Brad Pitt out of this film and it is just a so-so time travel film. Released the same year as his great performance in Se7en, this film was an outstanding example of his range and capabilities. He was the focus of the film even if he wasn't on screen that long. You knew he HAD to be the one responsible.Bruce Willis just did not impress me with his acting here. He just seemed to scream and run around a lot. Nothing impressive at all.Madeline Stowe (Short Cuts, The General's Daughter) gave a good performance as one who came to believe Willis. Too bad, it was too late - or was it? Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Fisher King) left us hanging at the end to devise our own scenario.Like I said, it was a good time-travel movie and Brad Pitt makes it worth watching.",7,0,3,28 October 2007
Au Revoir les Enfants," I found the treasure all by myself.
","Practically sweeping the César Awards (seven win out of nine nominations), this Oscar nominated film is a reminisce for writer/director Louis Malle (Atlantic City, Murmur of the Heart).A WWII film about a Catholic school that hides Jews, it is a story of an upper born French student Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) who befriends a Jewish student Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö). Julien is based upon Malle's childhood memories.Of course, I got to reminisce a little myself as I spent a year in a school just like this.Quentin discovers Bonnet is a Jew, and cannot understand all the fuss.While e is trying to figure things out, Father Jean (Philippe Morier-Genoud) is really hitting hard with the sermons, even causing some parents to walk out. At lunch with his mother (Francine Racette) and brother (Stanislas Carré de Malberg) and Bonnet, he is exposed to collaborators.But the real revelation comes when Joseph (François Négret), a kitchen worker who got fired for black market activity, sells out the school to the Nazis and the Jewish children are captured to be taken to the death camps. It was at that time that Quentin realized what a treasure he had truly found.",8,3,5,12 April 2009
Shaun of the Dead," Zombie or Slacker film?
","I really couldn't make up my mind whether this was a slacker film or a zombie film. It seems to be a little of both. Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) seem like slackers who like to play video games, and Sahun is certainly lazy and inconsiderate where his girlfriend (Kate Ashfield) is concerned. But, the film quickly moves to the zombie part, and that is where the real laughs begin. Of course Shaun is quick on the uptake (not a surprise for a slacker) and doesn't get the fact that there is danger right away. No prob, the cricket bat works where the records and flatware doesn't. It is a brilliant send-up of the zombie genre, and the funny bits are just too numerous to mention. Also includes Pirates star Bill Nighy, who will join Pegg and Frost this weekend in Hot Fuzz. Even if you are not a horror fan, you will find this hilarious. Can't wait for Friday to get here.",8,1,4,14 April 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Absolutely stunning!
","This was an absolutely stunning film and had a great story to boot. Johnny Depp was definitely cheated out of a Golden Globe for his performance in this film. The visual effects were over the top and the Oscar was well deserved, but I really felt that the musical score by Hans Zimmer was as good or better than his previous outstanding efforts (Batman Begins, Gladiator, The Last Samurai).The only thing I enjoyed better than Kiera Knightly's outstanding Vanity Fair cover in December 2005 was her performance her. She gets better every time I see her.I also have to give props to Jonathon Pryce (The Rachel Papers), Naaomi Harris (28 Days Later), and all those fantastic people who did the makeup for this film.I certainly will be there for the next chapter.",8,0,2,1 April 2007
Stripes," You can't go. All the plants are gonna die.
","He quit his job and lost his girlfriend. before Lost in Translation and Broken Flowers, he was just a wacky pain-in-the-ass recruit that gave Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates) nightmares. When it comes to comedy Bill Murray is a winner hands down.Add in John Candy; John Larroquette as the peeping Capt. Stillman; Judge Reinhold; Harold Ramis; the quick peep at Roberta Leighton; and the hot Lois Hamilton and you have a military comedy of errors that will keep you in stitches.Of course there is a lot of beautiful scenery in this film in the showers and in the mud pit.",7,21,31,29 September 2007
12 Angry Men," Human life don't mean as much to them as it does to us!
","How I managed to avoid seeing this critically acclaimed film up to now is a mystery. After watching a piece of complete and utter trash last night, I have to revert to something of quality to cleanse my palate.Henry Fonda, the calm voice of reason one one side, and Lee J. Cobb screaming on the other. Ed Begley plays an enraged racist that mirrors Cobb's anger.Some of the best actors of the time were in that room: Oscar winner Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, double Oscar-nominee Jack Warden, Cobb with two Oscar nominations, and Oscar winners Begley and Fonda. They played their parts brilliantly, giving us an insight into their characters and how that influenced their decisions.Simply amazing!",9,1,3,12 July 2010
Hostel," I get a lot of money for you, and that makes you MY bitch.
","This is your worst freakin' nightmare! Take three typical young men on a trip to Europe for pot and sex and let them think they are having the time of their lives. Then, when they least expect it - Bam! They are caught up in a torture operation that is so unbelievable that it shakes you to the core of your being.Well, I take that back. In this age of overpaid corporate assholes, I can believe that they soon are bored with spending money on $400 cigars and expensive liquor and seek out perversions such as this.The actual torture wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, but the horror was absolutely brilliant. Eli Roth has established himself as a director of horror. The last 30 minutes was so carefully crafted that it stand well above anything I have ever seen.And, wow, a cameo by Takashi Miike, the director of Ichi the Killer and Graveyard of Honor.The only person I recognized was Rick Hoffman. I guess I'll have to wait and see what Jay Hernandez does in Part II. It should be interesting.",7,2,3,11 August 2007
Oldboy," Revenge is good for your health, but pain will find you again.
","After watching The Dentist and this film, I don't think anyone is going to be touching my teeth again.Dae-su Oh (Min-sik Choi) is imprisoned for 15 years and has no idea why. When he gets out, he starts trying to find the answers, and that is when the violence gets started.But in a Hitchcockian ending the answer was thought to be one thing and turned out to be completely different. This is when Min-Sik Choi really performed. He was outstanding! A compelling story that kept your interest until it completely blew you away, outstanding acting, and perfect direction.This is a classic.",9,1,6,1 January 2009
Spider-Man 2," It can't be stopped. It's self-sustaining now.
","'He knows a hero when he sees one. Too few characters out there, flying around like that, saving old girls like me. And Lord knows, kids like Henry need a hero. Courageous, self-sacrificing people. Setting examples for all of us. Everybody loves a hero. People line up for them, cheer them, scream their names. And years later, they'll tell how they stood in the rain for hours just to get a glimpse of the one who taught them how to hold on a second longer. I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.' I went back to look at this one, my favorite, again. If it wasn't for the success of Sam Raimi's Spider-man 2, there would be no 3. The direction, sound, special effects, and the characters all combined to make an enjoyable adventure.This had Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) at her best and really focused on her relationship with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Alfred Molina was fantastic as Doc Ock. I am not a comics fan, but I do love Spider-Man and this is the best Spider-Man movie.",9,10,16,24 July 2007
Black Book," An exciting tale of espionage
","When I think of a Paul Verhoeven film, I think of excitement - Total Recall, Flesh+Blood, Robocop, etc. He hits another home run with this tale of the Dutch resistance against the Nazis and the sacrifice made by one woman (Carice van Houten) to avenge the death of her family. Van Houten, who we will see again as Tom Cruise's wife in Valkyrie (although we will certainly not see her to the extent that we saw here here), was magnificent and really made this picture. There was a superb cast of supporting characters that made Gerard Soeteman's and Verhoeven's story come alive on the screen. Nobody stand out like Van Houten, and she made this one of the best film experiences of the year.",10,2,4,4 May 2008
Blade," I'm gonna be a naughty vampire god!

We're the top of the f*cking food chain. Well, not anymore you aren't. Thought you could take on Blade and live. Not a chance. Wesley Snipes id the ultimate vampire killer.I revisited this last night and found it to be as good as I remembered. Lots of kick butt action and thrilling vampire deaths along with some gorgeous women (Wright, Sanaa Lathan, Traci Lords, and the Russian Jenya Lano).This is the way a comic book should be brought to the screen.",6,0,2,6 August 2007
Superbad," Totally unexpected
","I totally did not expect to like this movie. I figured it would be full of gross jokes and language that would only appeal to 14-year-olds. I was blown away by how much fun it really was.Michael Cera gets a lot of buzz for his role as Evan, but it was Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse that had me rolling. I especially like the bit where Seth was in the liquor store. That was hilarious.Christopher Mintz-Plasse was also out there as the geek who was outdoing his buddies. With Bill Hader and Seth Rogen as wacky cops, the fun never stopped.But, despite the repetitive joking about getting BJs, it really came down to a movie about friendship and the pain of growing up. It was tender and touching underneath all the juvenile humor.The MILF jokes about Evan's mom (Stacy Edwards) were especially funny.",8,3,8,30 July 2008
The Great Dictator," Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
","The Great Dictator was Charlie Chaplin's first all-talking picture, and the first in which we heard the Little Tramp speak. Chaplin never used the Tramp character again after this film.This heartfelt satirical assault on Hitler and anti-Semitism is a tremendous badge of honor for Chaplin. Demoting Hitler to the level of a clown, he exposes the farcical base of fascism, much the same way Stanley Kubrick did with militarism in Dr. Strangelove.With Oscar class actors such as Paulette Goddard and Jack Oakie, and featuring the original Storm Troopers long before Star Wars, this film was one of the greatest of all times.",8,2,4,23 September 2007
Hot Fuzz," Nothing like a bit of girl on girl!
","This is, without any doubt whatever, the funniest movie this year and one of the funniest I have ever seen. Simon Pegg is simply brilliant; both as an actor and a writer.To see him together again with Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, Kinky Boots) was pure pleasure. In addition, there were several favorites from other films - Jim Broadbent, Bill Nighy, and Timothy Dalton.Edgar Wright was simply brilliant as the director. The action kept building and building until it reached a fever pitch. Just when you thought it was over, it came again, and then it came again. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, laughing my ass off.I want more from Pegg and Wright!",8,3,5,11 August 2007
The Natural," Great baseball movie
","Baseball almost seems an afterthought to the story about someone who got sidetracked by a mysterious woman (Barbara Hershey)on his way to greatness, but baseball and second chances are what this movie are all about. A great cast led by Robert Redford includes Glenn Close (The Shield), Robert Duvall (The Godfather), Kim Basinger (Cellular), and Wilford Brimley.This film has it all - baseball, second chances, gambling, underhanded chicanery, ambition, friendship, magic; but most of all, it is just plain fun, romantic, and exciting. It is what a baseball movie is supposed to be - better than the game.",8,0,2,22 March 2007
The Others," This house is ours, this house is ours.
","Mrs. Mills: Sometimes the world of the living gets mixed up with the world of the dead.In a day when special effects rule, this is a creepy fright film that really rocks.Alejandro Amenábar (The Sea Inside) has written and directed a horror film that uses sights and sounds effectively to make you jump from your seat. The movie builds slowly to the climax which is a real shocker.Nicole Kidman was absolutely stunning as the mother protecting her children during WWII. Fionnula Flanagan (Four Brothers, Tears of the Sun) was also very good as the housekeeper. I also enjoyed Alakina Mann (Girl with a Pearl Erring) as the daughter.A must see.",8,6,8,28 July 2007
Troy," Peace is for the women, and the weak. Empires are forged by war.
","As impressive as 300 and Beowulf were, they are not nearly as impressive as seeing real armies with real fighters like Achilles (Brad Pitt) and Hector (Eric Bana). This is the epic battle movie that rivals Braveheart for excitement.Costuming, sound, stunt work - all were top notch and framed two love stories; the well known love of Paris (Orlando Bloom) for Helen (Diane Kruger), and the love of Achilles for Briseis(Rose Byrne). Kruger was perfect for the role of Helen, for one can truly believe that she would be the beauty that would launch 1000 ships.Peter O'Toole as King Priam was impressive as always and really made that role.A fantastic movie that made the most of it's 160 minutes under the more than capable direction of Wolfgang Petersen.",8,1,5,28 January 2008
Brokeback Mountain," Love on the Mountain
","When I first real Annie Proulx's book Close Range, I was captivated. She is a fantastic writer and really captures the feeling of the West. Brokeback Mountain was just one story in the book, and now, because of the movie, it is a book unto itself. Personally, I would recommend Close Range over a separate Brokeback Mountain. You may not be familiar to Proulx's writing, but many have seen another of her books made into a movie - The Shipping News. One can only hope that this continues with That Old Ace in the Hole, another great work of hers set in the Texas Panhandle, where I lived for almost ten years. I haven't read Bad Dirt yet, but it is on my list as it is a followup to Close Range.But this isn't supposed to be about Proulx, but about Ang Lee's adaptation of her short story into the movie Brokeback Mountain. I was captivated by this movie. I was so captivated that is Angelina Jolie and Halle Berry sat on either side of me during the film, I would not have noticed. Well, that may be too much, but you get the idea.The scenery and the music were both an integral part of the experience. It was an experience, not just a film. I was aching to be up on that mountain for the summer and enjoy it's beauty. The music added so much to that beauty. It just seemed to sweep me away.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal played incredible parts and really made you feel part of a tortured and impossible love. I should point out to those who may feel that there are parts of the movie they may find disturbing that they were done in such a manner that they were meant to show love, not titillation. In fact, the only titillating part were Michelle Williams incredibly beautiful breasts. I will say that I would not want to have to choose between Williams and Rachel Weisz for the Oscar next month.Brokeback Mountain was a beautiful love story and a beautiful experience.",10,12,13,28 January 2006
The Hustler," Newman in another great film
","This film by Robert Rossen (All the King's Men ) won a couple of minor Oscars along with a dozen other wins out of a couple of dozen award nominations.It had a star-studded cast including Paul Newman (Cool Hand Luke) as Fast Eddie Felson, Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats, Piper Laurie (Carrie), and George C. Scott (Patton).A classic story of losing and getting back to the top, with the sometimes high costs associated with that struggle. There are not enough superlatives to describe the acting that this film contains. It is a brilliant study of black and white film-making in an age before special effects.",8,1,1,28 April 2007
Terminator Salvation," Win or lose, this war ends tonight!
","If Christian Bale and Helena Bonham Carter are in a movie, I am going to watch and enjoy. No matter how many Terminator fans tell me otherwise.Sure, it probably borrowed from Transfomers with it's big robots, but at least we didn't have Shia LaBoef. Anyway the robot was cool and I wonder if the 7-11 that got blown up had the Farmville products. Would Farmville still be around in 2018? When Moon Bloodgood appeared, I fell in love.It's mindless entertainment for those who want lots of explosions and man versus machine excitement, Just sit back and enjoy.",6,3,7,22 June 2010
Juno," I'm already pregnant, so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?
","Yo Yo Yiggady Yo - I am surprised that one critic focused on the fact that Juno may not have considered the fact that she would get pregnant after having unprotected sex. Where has this guy/gal been living? With 28 years of conservative rule in America, it is amazing that every teen is so ill informed as they manage to keep it a secret in school and it is not something parents talk about as they don't think they're little Juno would do such a thing.So, the premise of the film was really real and the story was funny and exciting even for an old fart like me that really didn't understand all the language. They really should have had subtitles. Honest to blog.'It's probably just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?' A food baby? That's forshizz up the spout. Oh my GOD. Oh sh*t! Phuket, Thailand! Do they really talk like that? 'Hey there, big puffy version of Junebug!' J.K. Simmons was just so cool as her dad. No dad is that understanding. He was magnificent in the role.'... but I was hoping she was expelled, or into hard drugs.' Not having seen Allison Janney since 'The West Wing,' I really enjoyed her performance as Juno's mom.'Desperately Seeking Spawn.' Her BFF Leah (Olivia Thirlby) was so funny and makes me want to find something else she has been in.Jennifer Garner was great as the wacky Yuppie that wanted a baby. Her husband was just a perv.'As far as boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss. He is the cheese to my macaroni. And, I know that people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce, but... I guess normalcy isn't really our style.' Then there is Ellen Page, who I loved in Hard Candy. She was stupendous and made this film a joy to watch. You go girl!",8,1,5,8 November 2008
The Day After Tomorrow," Now, do you see what is going to happen?
","OK, it is not possible to freeze overnight like this, but if we keep going the way we are, we are in for one crazy ride, and in a few hundred thousand years, we may just have another ice age. So get all this out and let's talk about the movie.I like Dennis Quaid. He never seems to disappoint. He's no Al Pacino, but he is a solid actor. he plays a great part in this flick as a scientist who gets ignored. He is going after his son. This is where the great action takes place.Jake Gyllenhaal from Brokeback Mountain was also goo. He never lost faith in his old man. And Emmy Rossum from Phantom of the Opera. Yum! Ans Sela Ward. Not a big part, but she can always be depended upon to do a great job.Hey, it was a popcorn movie and not a waste of time.",6,0,1,14 March 2007

It is, of course, a series that runs too long, is too confusing, and has too many characters that really don't contribute to the plot.Of course, I came back to see Johnny Depp and Kiera Knightly, and the fantastic makeup and the special effects, and some great costumes for Elizabeth, but this movie just seemed to drag on and on and it really got tiresome towards the end.How anyone could vote this their favorite threequel over The Bourne Ultimatum is beyond comprehension.It is fitting that Sparrow heads to Florida at the end. It is hoped that this series will be retired.",7,0,2,18 May 2008
Spider-Man 3," I almost walked out
","Yes, I will admit it. There was a point after an hour and a half that I was ready to call it quits. I'm glad I stayed, but it was a struggle.To start off, the Title was stunning. I really felt that was one of the very best I've seen. Too bad I can't identify who did the opening.Not to take away from Tobey Maguire, but Kirsten Dunst is critical to my enjoyment of the movie. I thought the idea of having her sing was terrible. She is just above Celine Dion, who rates just above a screeching blackboard to me. No more singing, Kirsten. Please.Who is Topher Grace? Get him out of here! Thomas Haden Church was good. Two demons is good. New Goblin and Sandman - OK. Venom was too much.Needless to say the visual effects and sound and music were exceptional. Fight sequences were way too long.Bryce Dallas Howard and Elizabeth Banks - Hot! I liked seeing more of Mageina Tovah. She has a quaint cuteness about her and matches perfectly with Peter parker.It sure seemed longer than the listed 140 minutes.",6,4,10,4 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," It really is the end of the world.
","Sometimes you can nitpick a movie to death and not really say anything useful. I particularly am distressed when one compares a movie to a book or a video game. A movie may be based on a book or movie, but it stands alone.I watch some movies for intellectual stimulation, some for physical stimulation, some just to have a good laugh, and some just to be entertained without a lot of effort on my part. This movie fits that last motive perfectly.It's sole purpose is to entertain and it did that well. There really wasn't a lot of story here; just enough to frame the battles with the zombies and those freaking birds! The mutant doctor was really good and Milla Jovovich is always a pleasure to watch. The addition of Ashanti got my pulse racing, too. Hey, the gals can take about the hot guys; I'm not interested.Pop some corn, sit back and be entertained.",6,0,1,7 July 2008
Zodiac," Oh God, save us all.
","I am not sold on this film. At over two and a half hours, it seemed as long as the investigation itself.Why didn't David Fincher give us a tight and exciting film like Se7en? Yes, the investigation had an impact on many people other than those who were killed, and Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. did a credible job of showing that, but there just wasn't the emotion that we saw with Brad Pitt. It just seemed like a long, boring investigation of little things that suggested who the killer might be.The bottom line is despite a few award nominations, the film won none, and that is because there are many better films out there. I expected a lot and was sorely disappointed.",6,3,5,18 January 2008
Milk," Without hope, life's not worth living.
","I won't go into the legacy of Harvey Milk except to say that he was a champion for the LGBT community, especially in his efforts to get everyone to be honest and come out of the closet so that all of us could see that we had friends, relatives, teachers, and others in our lives that were gay, and that was OK.I won't say anything about the slime on the right depicted in this film except to say that their plan backfired. Yes, the battle for equal rights for all Americans is still being fought, and battles will continue to be lost along the way, but right will win in the end.The movie was excellent, and I really liked the way news footage from the period was intertwined seamlessly to make the experience more real.Josh Brolin, who I just saw in W. the other day, was very good and there was a tortured underbelly that was not revealed. Maybe I am just to the point that it never surprises me when a right wing bigot turns out to have secrets.Sean Penn was magnificent. He was Harvey Milk, and he was the movie. Everyone else just supported his superb performance. I will be very surprised if he doesn't get an Academy Award for this performance.An excellent movie. Not superb, but well worth seeing. In fact, I think I want to see it again.",8,2,7,18 February 2009
The Prestige," Are you watching closely?
","Olivia Wenscombe: It won't bring your wife back. Robert Angier: I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.Christian Bale (The Machinist, Batman begins) was absolutely stunning in the tale of two magicians who are constantly trying to outdo each other. X-man Hugh Jacman was his rival, who ostensibly wanted revenge for the death of his wife, but who was really more interested in being number one.The is the basic story, but it is what is going on beneath that that makes this a superior film. While you are watching the rivalry, the magicians are preparing a trick that will amaze and astonish you. You know it has to be a trick, but they pull it off anyway, and that is what makes this film.The outstanding camera work was by Wally Pfister, who did Batman Begins, and who will be doing The Dark Knight. The superb direction was by Christopher Nolan, who also did the two mentioned films.Both stars were admirably supported by Michael Caine, British star Rebecca Hall, and the ever-lovely Scarlett Johansson.",8,1,3,5 August 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Villainy wears many masks, none of which so dangerous as virtue...
","This Oscar winning film not only is a real visual pleasure with outstanding cinematography and visual effects, but it has some of the most enjoyable actors on screen in one place.Johnny Depp, who most recently thrilled us in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, is Constable Ichabod Crane, who is sent to Sleepy Hollow, much as Nicholas Angel was sent to a small village in Hott Fuzz, to solve three recent murders.I always enjoy Christina Ricci, whom I last saw in Black Snake Moan. Here she is Katrina Van Tassel, and as beautiful as ever.Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman was a perfect choice.Lisa Marie, who seems to have quit acting since her breakup with director Tim Burton, appears as Icabod's mother, and certainly would have caused any seven-year-old to have wicked thoughts.A fascinating mystery with supernatural horror.",8,0,0,14 June 2009
Hotel Rwanda," You're black. You're not even a n*gger. You're an African.
","One of the great accomplishments of Terry George (In the Name of the Father, Some Mother's Son) in writing and directing this film was to show the atrocities being done during the 100 days of genocide without getting an R rating so that as many people as possible could see what happens when you don't have oil in your backyard.Despite international news coverage of the violence as it unfolded, most countries, including France, Belgium, and the United States, declined to prevent or stop the massacres. Is that a surprise? There is nothing to gain for us. We generally only take action when there is something we want, like oil in Iraq.Don Cheatle (Crash, A Lesson Before Dying) was magnificent, as was Sophie Okonedo (Aeon Flux), who played his wife. Seeing Nick Nolte and Jean reno was also a big plus in their small roles.A story that needs to be told and watch over and over.",8,0,0,22 November 2007
Once," Following your dream
","Continuing to watch films about music, I got a chance to see this well regarded Indy film about singer/songwriters in Ireland.The music was incredibly beautiful. There was also a touching story of love and loss, not only in the music, but also outside the music.I am a firm Czech lover after seeing Markéta Irglová. She was just fantastic, and really lit up the screen.Anyone who has ever experience unrequited love, anyone who has ever lost a love, anyone who has ever given up a love to pursue a dream, will find magic in this film.I'm just not sure about the ending.",8,0,2,22 June 2008
Catch-22," Get back in the car, you smirking slut!
","Dr. 'Doc' Daneeka: Sure. Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat isn't really crazy, so I can't ground him. Yossarian: OK, let me see if I've got this straight. In order to be grounded, I've got to be crazy. And I must be crazy to keep flying. But if I ask to be grounded, that means I'm not crazy anymore, and I have to keep flying. Dr. 'Doc' Daneeka: You got it, that's Catch-22. Yossarian: Whoo... That's some catch, that Catch-22. Dr. 'Doc' Daneeka: It's the best there is.People don't want to watch movie showing the stupidity of war. They want heroes so they can go to sleep at night thinking all those dead soldiers meant something.Unfortunately, war is just failed diplomacy, or someone showing how big his cajones are. What's the purpose of an Army if we can't use it? Why are the Japanese now dropping bombs. Because a defensive Army is useless in showing cajones.Alan Arkin is magnificent as Capt. John Yossarian, who just wants to go home. He knows he's crazy to keep flying, but knowing that means he's not crazy, so he has to keep flying, which is crazy.The cast of this movie is one of the best I have seen: Martin Balsam, Richard Benjamin, Art Garfunkel, Bob Newhart, Paula Prentiss, Norman Fell, Charles Grodin and more giving us laughs aplenty from Buck Henry's superb screenplay based on Joseph Heller's novel under the direction of Mike Nichols.And, of course, there is Olimpia Carlisi, reason alone to watch.",8,0,1,24 July 2007
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Oh, good. For a moment there I thought we were in trouble.
","The Academy Awards were all over this film for music and cinematography and the script, but they completely ignored the actors. BAFTA did a little better in recognizing Robert Redford and Katherine Ross. Paul Newman seems to be given short shrift in the film.There is no denying the quality of the direction by George Roy Hill (The Sting, Slap Shot), and the brilliant script by William Goldman, who won an Oscar for this script and for All The President's Men. He also wrote Marathon Man. But direction, scenery, and a great script are nothing if you don't have great actors to deliver the lines.Redford was outstanding, Newman set him up perfectly, and Ross was dazzling. They all delivered the lines better than anyone I could imagine to make a semi-buddy film (can't leave Ross out). They also had great support from a great cast.Raindrops may keep falling on my head, but Newman and Redford rock.",8,0,0,6 October 2008
Crash," Should be mandatory viewing in every school
","I finally got my copy of Crash and was thrilled with the story. I have to admit that I wanted to see this movie because I had not see Jennifer Esposito or Thandie Newton in a long time and wonted to see if they were as good as I remembered - they were. But it was the story that really got me. This movie was all about prejudice and how it affected the lives of every single character. Every single character gave an outstanding performance displaying prejudice and it colors our thoughts, actions, and feelings and interferes in our lives. This movie should be shown and discussed in every school in the country - it is that good, and I, for one, Plan to watch it again in a day or two.",10,5,13,23 October 2005
Snatch," Who took the jam outta your doughnut?
","How can I possibly add anything worthwhile to what has already been said about Guy Ritchie's film? It is just plain hilarious with line after line that will have you rolling in the aisles, and more action than a Texas whorehouse on Saturday night.Personally, I'm partial to Brad Pitt and Jason Statham, but this film has so many great characters that anyone can have a favorite.Vinnie Jones, Ade, Robbie Gee, Stephen Graham, and Alan Ford are all great, and this is the best performance I've seen from Dennis Farina.Once this film gets rolling, it never stops until the revenge of the pikeys.",8,1,2,2 March 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Your Commie has no regard for human life. Not even his own.
","I am amazed that I had not seen this Stanley Kubrick classic before yesterday. I may not have appreciated it before, but it certainly is one of the best comedies ever produced. Even the title ranks among the funniest ever written.Beside the outstanding film Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket) has written and directed, there are stars that shine brightly throughout.Peter Sellers (Being There, The Pink Panther) was nominated for another Oscar for playing three roles in this film. He was just outstanding. George C. Scott (Patton) was over the top as Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson. Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, and Slim Pickens all turned in outstanding performances. Who will forget that final ride that Pickens made. Yee Haw! This is the definitive film showing just how ridiculous the cold warriors were. A must see.",10,6,11,9 June 2007
The Beach," Now get some sleep, I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast.
","Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) brings Leonardo DiCaprio back after Titanic in a story that will make his fans cheer, but leave the rest of us feeling that we were cheated.Long on philosophy, but very short on excitement, this is a movie about Camelot. You remember, don't you, '...there's simply not a more congenial spot for happily-ever-aftering than here in Camelot.' Or, on the beach, for that matter.Except there is a price to pay for even this, the most idyllic of spots. Even here, the nastiness of death and dying must not intrude. It's how we manage to avoid the ugliness of hundreds of thousands of dead in Iraq, and our reputation sullied by those who condone torture. We mustn't let anything interfere with our pursuit of big screen TVs our gas-guzzling SUVs.With her beautiful face, Virginie Ledoyen (The Valet, 8 Women) was the bright spot in this movie. Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton) made a perfect white witch who ran the paradise and was willing to preserve it at all costs - even her humanity.But, it only exists in your dreams, my friend.",7,1,3,14 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," And now, young Skywalker... you will die.
","Just as in the other films, the sound and special effects, as well as the costumes and makeup and John Williams' music were all fantastic.Mark Hamill gave an excellent performance along with Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams under the direction of Richard Marquand, the writer of Nowhere to Run and The Eye of the Needle, who died a few years after this film.This was a great film for the whole family and one that shows evil empires, Dark Lords, and those that subvert democracy will eventually fail. Well, one certainly hopes so.A real thrill!",8,2,6,27 December 2007
MASH," No. No booze. Sex. I want sex.

Pan's Labyrinth," There are small remnants of our democracy remaining to be found.
","Pan's Labyrinth, by Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (Mimic, Chronos, Hellboy), is a serious piece of work, making profound use of its fantasy.It is Spain, 1944. The brave resistance continues the fight against the fascists. Carmen - Ariadna Gil (Alatriste, Belle Epoque, Revolver), travels to meet her new husband, the fascist Captain Vidal - Sergi Lopez (Dirty Pretty Things, A Pornographic Affair). With her is Ofelia - Ivana Baquero (Rottweiler, Romasanta), her daughter by her first marriage.Captain Vidal wants his son to be born in Franco's 'new Spain'which he will create by brute force if necessary. The fascists' sadistic repression is demonstrated by violent sequences, such as Captain Vidal beating a poacher to death with a bottle.Captain Vidal is only concerned for his son and orders the doctor to sacrifice Carmen, if necessary.Full of fascist disdain for women, Captain Vidal fails to notice that his trusted housekeeper Mercedes - Maribel Verdu (Y tu mamá también, Belle Epoque), is spying for the resistance. He also fails to understand why Dr. Ferreiro - Alex Angulo (The Day of the Beast), does not simply obeyed his orders.He also fails to understand why the democratic resistance opposes his fascist fantasies.Ofelia is attempting to return to a fantasy world where truth reins and fascist lies are not allowed. There is a heavenly turn in the end, where the reward for passing the final test is her elevation to a throne alongside her father and mother. But, just like Spain, that is all fantasy as the Catholic Church was aligned with the fascists and there is no heavenly reward for the democratic unbelievers.Fascists the world over, including those in our government are determined to crush all opposition and to demonstrate their victory. The themes of remembering the evils and the search for truth are woven throughout the film.There may be only small pockets of truth left in America, as there are in Spain, but we can seek them out as we seek the remembrances of the Princess' life on earth. We won't find them among those who subjugate women or destroy democracy, but there is hope for all of us that cherish truth that we will find it.As Franco destroyed Spain, and the Republican fascists attempt to destroy America, we than Del Toro for his beautiful reminder that hope is not lost.",10,15,27,25 June 2007
Final Destination 2," Brian, I think you'd better go check that barbecue.
","This was almost like a flashback to a few weeks ago when the exact same thing happened for real on Interstate 4. It wasn't a log truck, but fog and a controlled burn that caused an 80-car pileup and much burning of trucks and bodies. I could not help but think of that when I saw the incredible accident scene in this film. It could have been used as news footage.This is probably only the second film in which I have seen A.J. Cook (JJ from 'Criminal Minds') and Ali Larter ('Heroes'), but they did a credible job in a film where the story was far more important than the individual characters, none of whom rose to any significance. In fact. most were probably former WB stars. The only one I remember with any interest was Odessa Munroe.But the story and the special effects and the gore and, certainly, the suspense, made this film worth watching and peaked my interest in the prequel and the sequel, although not having seen the first one does not take anything away from this one.Check it out.",7,2,2,17 February 2008
Blade II," I'm a Supervamp
","It's based on a comic book and revels in that history. It has more grotesque scenes than in all of George Romero's zombie classics combined, which is why it is a hit with horror fans. One of the redeeming factors is it's fight scenes. Don't take my word for it. The fight scenes in this movie are better than Green Goblin vs. Spiderman or Gangs of New York, both which lost to it in the awards chase.Blade (Wesley Snipes, who is so chiseled that his six-pack abs look stocked with 16-ounce cans) and the Bloodpack are on the trail of of super-vampires, led by Nomak (Luke Goss). These über living dead are pasty, rheumy-eyed monsters whose chins are laced up with seam-like scars. When they eat, their chins open like maws, revealing spiky tongues to do more damage. These guys aren't bothered by silver bullets or garlic.Hey! Who does vampire tats? And, why are the vampires in these movies like Versace-ridden Eurotrash you see dwelling in the most perilous areas of nightclubs.Music by Gorrilaz, Mos Def and Ice Cube add to the dark ambiance of the movie.",7,0,1,23 March 2007
Knocked Up," Ben watches Ben # 2
","OK, I am just not with it. I didn't think Borat was funny, either.I'm going to start a website where I watch comedies and let people know where the funny parts are. In this one the first laugh came at exactly 60 minutes. That is when Ben (Seth Rogen) was on his knees proposing. Dude, you can't be serious? That is so funny! Now, the next laugh comes at 88 minutes when Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Alison (Katherine Heigl) are trying to get into the club. Major laughs here. That was it - just two laughs the whole movie. Oh, I am sure those who vote on teen Choice and People's Choice awards found many more laughs from this bunch of pathetic losers. I mean, who doesn't know about Mr. Skin?Maybe it was just depression overflowing from watch Ben in Don't Let Me Die on a Sunday. No, two Bens, two movies, one seriously depressing, and the other just not funny, dude. So sue me.",5,0,5,1 July 2008
Alien," The ship will automatically destruct in 'T' minus five minutes.
","Ridley Scott directed a winner here. I don't need to list all the awards this film won and was considered for; let's just say it was a sh*tload.I have never been a sci-fi buff, but I was attached like glue to this film from start to finish. The horror was minimal, but the suspense was incredible.Sigourney Weaver was everything I was expecting. She was just incredible and made this film worth watching.Tom Skerritt was the jerk that I expected him to be. He did not disappoint.There was a great supporting cast and this film is a must for all suspense buffs.",9,2,3,3 September 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," At last! My arm is complete again!
","It is a scene worthy of Charles Dickens: gray buildings, gray skies and gray-faced people, living and dead. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter shine as Sweeney, the barber with a grudge, and Mrs. Lovett, who is in love with him.Narrator: This is the tale of an ordinary man, who had everything... Mrs. Lovett: Barker, his name was. Benjamin Barker. Narrator: Until a man of power stole his freedom, destroyed his family and banished him... for life. And in his sorrow a new man was born. Todd vows to have his pie in the form of revenge over the cruel Judge (Alan Rickman) who sent him to prison to steal his wife (Laura Michelle Kelly).Sweeney Todd: 'There's a hole in the world like a great black pit, and it's filled with people who are full of shite, and the vermin of the world inhabit it...' One can hear a socialist screed against those of privilege who will give to the poor for once, transforming Mrs. Lovett's pies from the worst to the best in London.Sweeney Todd: 'They all deserve to die/Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett, tell you why/Because in all of the whole human race Mrs. Lovett there are two kinds of men and only two/There's the one staying put in his proper place and one with his foot in the other one's face...' The singing, while not what one would expect on Broadway, was on-key and the songs ('The Worst Pies in London', 'My Friends', 'Johanna', 'A Little Priest', and many more) were a pure delight.Tim Burton's adaptation was absolutely marvelous with outstanding acting by Depp, Carter, and newcomer Ed Sanders. I even have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the performance of Sacha Baron Cohen. I really never thought I would say that!Timothy Spall was a delight with his rat face, and the only thing that detracted from perfection was the absence of Carter's meat pies in their full glory.",9,3,5,13 January 2008
Elf," Will Ferrell is not funny!
","I will be honest. I could not make it all the way through this film. The idea of a 30-year-old man acting as if he was developmentally disabled was too much for me to take. In fact, I don't know any people with developmental disabilities that act like him.Belching loudly and eating spaghetti with syrup was gross, not amusing. There was nothing amusing in the hour I managed to stay - I couldn't take any more! James Caan looked as if he needed a big dose of ex-lax the entire film. I would not smile either if Ferrell was my son.Zooey Deschanel going out with Ferrell. That's about as dumb as Katherine Heigl hooking up with Seth Rogan.The only redeeming quality of this movie was Mary Steenburgen and Peter Dinklage. Even they couldn't save it.",1,19,60,3 December 2007
Taxi Driver," De Niro was outstanding!
","I actually saw this for the first time this morning. I couldn't sleep and it was on at 4am. It was every bit as good as I was led to believe.Comparing the two, I cannot see how this lost to Rocky at the Academy Awards. Scorsese fans will also agree that he deserved a directing award for this film. While De Niro and Foster were fantastic, I feel that Cybill Shepherd was equally good, and should have been recognized for her performance. This film won 18 awards out of 27 nominations. Basically only the Academy didn't get on the bandwagon. But, in all those nominations, none for Sheperd. I really think that was wrong.Great film, and I will watch it again and again.",9,5,8,27 April 2007
Shutter Island," Don't you get it? You're a rat in a maze.
","Not your usual police investigation. The Doctor in charge, Ben Kingsley, appears to be hiding something from the beginning.Leonardo DiCaprio played a US Marshall who was tortured by his own demons from the War. He also lost his wife, and was constantly dreaming of her.Well, everything is not as it seems, as the third act completely takes you by surprise. You are led by director Martin Scorsese to a point where the truth takes you completely by surprise.DiCaprio and Kingsley are magnificent, and ably assisted by Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Ted Levine, and Emily Mortimer.A very suspenseful film that really challenges your mind.",8,3,6,10 June 2010
Capote," A real insight into Capote
","It was a book that changed modern non-fiction. Truman Capote's non-fiction novel, In Cold Blood, made him a star. But the interesting thing is that he never finished another book. Did the conflicts he suffered in writing the book ruin him as a writer? This film paints an illuminating light into that question.I found it hard to watch as his speech was difficult to understand, but I could see the pain as he explained, 'It's as if Perry and I grew up in the same house. And one day he went out the back door and I went out the front. ' As someone who grew up near Kansas and was barely a teen when Capote was writing this book, I would have never known him. But, I have to say that I feel I am closer to him than ever having watched Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance in Capote. He was brilliant.Of course, let's not forget that this was a Chris Cooper double feature. He played an excellent role here as the DA.",10,1,1,30 April 2006
Chak de! India," There's only room for one bully on this team! And that bully is me.
","I am not what you would call a sports fan. I do not get any vicarious thrill watching someone else do what I can't. I appreciate great sportsmen/women like Tiger Woods or Lorena Ochoa or Danica Patrick, but I generally avoid watching unless it is a national event like the World Cup or the Olympics.Having said that, I am a huge fan of sports movies. They are a source of excitement and inspiration if they are done well. This one is one of the best that I have seen.It has so many good points, that it is hard to list them all. The obsession with national pride and the fact that a star player is scapegoated for a loss is first and foremost in this film. We are all allowed to make one mistake, aren't we? Not if your mistake costs the country to lose a title and lose face to a huge enemy. Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan) made such a mistake and it caused him to leave his home and go into exile for seven years.He returned to take a job that no one wanted. He would coach a women's hockey team to the World Championships. No one wanted it because it was a women's team, and we all know that is usually just a Title IX requirement and not to be taken seriously. In fact, they didn't even want to fund the trip to the World Championships after he trained the team. Money was to be used for a men's team. Women belong barefoot and pregnant and in the kitchen, as one Arkansas politician put it some years ago.To watch 150+ minutes of women's hockey, you have to have one hell of a story and some very interesting characters. The challenge of Khan transforming sixteen championship players from all over India into a team that puts India first, was mesmerizing. You know how the story will end. It ends as all sports movies do, but it is the journey that is fascinating. To see the neanderthal attitudes of the country transformed through excellence in sport is both exciting and sad. (Don't be so smug, America, your record on women isn't too much better.) If you are looking for an exciting movie that will thrill you beyond belief, then this is the one. Do not miss it.",9,2,3,12 May 2008
Ocean's Thirteen," You shook Sinatra's hand. You should know better.
","I won't say there will not be an Ocean's Fourteen because Rocky and Rambo seem to go on and one, and this may too, but it would be a shame. This movie was just a shadow of Ocean's Eleven and it seemed that the stars were phoning it in.The best part of a caper film is the setup. There was little of that present here. It was more concerned with given stars like Andy Garcia some air time. It just didn't work for me and I felt that they were just looking for another paycheck for the gang.Of course, I will join the fans of People and Teen Choice, and say that I enjoyed seeing George Clooney and Brad Pitt again, but I was unimpressed with their performances. I also like seeing Ellen Barkin, but she was way below the standard she set in The Big Easy. Eddie Izzard is always enjoyable.Let's hope that they don't do any more.",6,0,0,23 June 2008
Lost in Translation," It's better the second time around
","Sometimes I watch a movie and I just don't get it. The accolades flowed for this one and I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Maybe it is the deadpan way that Bill Murray plays his characters. He just seems so emotionless to me.I watched it again this morning and it made perfect sense to me. It was an extremely funny movie that showed how things do get Lost in Translation. Not only the obvious cultural differences from the land of my birth and the land of my heritage, but the differences between men and women.Not only was it a funny film, but it was sweet and tender at the same time and the obstacles were overcome in the end to where both understood each other perfectly.",9,2,5,11 March 2007
We Are Marshall," The funerals end today!
","I love sports movies. You generally know how they are going to turn out. They always catch that pass at the last second, or hit that home run with two out in the bottom of the ninth to win the game, but that doesn't spoil them for me. It is that coming back from the bottom that really inspires.Coming back from the tragedy that struck Marshall was a seemingly impossible task. It wasn't just a football program that needed to be rebuilt, but a whole town that needed to believe again. It made for an inspiring story.Matthew McConaughey was the right pick to play the coach. He just seems right in that position. Besides that, he knows how to survive impossible odds (U-571, A Time to Kill).David Strathairn (The Bourne Ultimatum, Good Night, and Good Luck) is one of my favorites, and I think he did an incredible job here.The only disappointment I have with this film is the fact that some people thought that Talladega Nights was a better sports film. Are they on crack?",7,2,2,5 January 2008
Full Metal Jacket," Seven-six-two millimeter. Full metal jacket.
","I love Vincent D'Onofrio. I am one of the few that think that 'Law & Order: Criminal Intent' is the best of the three because of him. He is an outstanding actor, and I have seen him in many films, but this tops them all for him.The first 45 minutes of this film is a movie unto itself as we watch the interplay between the f*ck-up Pvt. Pyle (D'Onofrio) and the drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey). Ermey played a brilliant over-the-top drill sergeant that would definitely scare anyone out of joining the Marines. His dance with Pvt. Pyle comes to a predictable end as Pyle is transformed into a killing machine. The whole movie is worth this 45 minutes.The Official line: 'Son, all I've ever asked of my marines is that they obey my orders as they would the word of God. We are here to help the Vietnamese, because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out. It's a hardball world, son. We've gotta keep our heads until this peace craze blows over.'After the first 45 minutes, we move into combat. This is where you see real combat soldiers, not some wannabes that look like they are auditioning for Universal Soldier.The soldier's line: 'If I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word, my word is poontang.' 'Personally, I think, uh... they don't really want to be involved in this war. You know, I mean... they sort of took away our freedom and gave it to the, to the gookers, you know. But they don't want it. They'd rather be alive than free, I guess. Poor dumb bastards.'Written and directed by Stanley Kubrick, this is the definitive Vietnam War movie.Beisdes Ermey and D'Onofrio. it has Adam Baldwin (Cruel Doubt, Independence Day), Matthew Modine (Short Cuts, Streamers, Notting Hill) and Dorian Harewood (Gothika, Glitter).Semper Fi!",9,1,2,28 May 2007
Glory," Freedom!
","There have been a few movies that have the theme of men struggling in battle against insurmountable or impossible odds. I recall Errol Flynn in 'The Charge of the Light Brigae,' or Mel Gibson in 'Braveheart,' or the new '300' in theaters now. 'Glory' is another such movie with the Oscar-winning Denzel Washington. That alone would be enough to recommend it, but there is so much more.Why there is Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman and Andre Braugher for one thing. There is great action, super cinematography, and a superb score.To see the struggle of men who want to be free and to be respected as men and are willing to go to the highest mountain to achieve that, you could see any of the movies mentioned. This is one of the best.",8,2,5,15 March 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," The Crazy Life
","There were two times in my life that I had the opportunity to chose something similar to Andy's job at Runway magazine. When I was in the military, I was offered the o0pportunity to work on the IG Team. It would have meant certain promotion, but I would never be home. After I left the military, I interviewed for a huge law firm and would have likely gotten the job changing their software to one I was very qualified in, but the interviewer wanted to know how I would handle picking up the lawyer's dry cleaning. I wasn't willing to do the job and it likely went to someone who would give up their life for the firm.The Devil Wears Prada was an enjoyable journey back to those times, and it was a great movie. Anne Hathaway (Andy) was fabulous as she tried to find herself in a world where she was clearly out of place. I enjoyed her in Brokeback Mountain, and I am really looking forward to seeing her as Jane Austin in her next film. Meryle Streep was fantastic as her boss, and Stanley Tucci deserves a statue for his incredible performance. Of course, I may be biases as i thought he was incredible when he did an episode of Monk, and I thought it a crime that 3 lbs was cut. Tracie Thoms had too small a part in the movie, but made the most of it. I loved her in Rent and am glad to see her in Cold Case.I gave up seeing Dreamgirlsfor this movie and I do not regret it. I will, of course, still see Dreamgirls next week.",8,1,2,13 January 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Outstanding thriller with a great understory.
","Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck): He lied to me. Now I can't think of one reason big enough for him to lie about that's small enough not to matter.I didn't see the trailer for this movie, so when that came came out I was surprised. I had a feeling about Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris), but it was nothing like what happened.It was this line, and many more like it, that stood out in this great first directorial effort and screenplay by Ben Affleck, based on a Dennis Lahane novel.Casey Affleck has gone way beyond the Ocean's movies with his role in this film. He played it with just the right amount of finesse. Nothing over the top. He was supported wonderfully by Michelle Monaghan, who just keeps impressing me with better and better performances.I really got drawn into this film because of two facts: one, I spent nine years working with the types of people in this film. I am no stranger to pedophiles and sex abusers, and completely understood Affleck's response. I have dealt with more than my share of trailer trash, and this film shows that not all of them live in trailers. All this sets up the reason why I am so drawn to the TV show 'House.' Everything is not black and white. There is so much gray that it makes it difficult to know what is right. This movie shows a whole lot of that gray and questions I have answered or seen answered on the job and in courts. If you want to see a good taste of the daily routine of child abuse, then this is what it is all about - neglect by those who are consumed by alcohol and drugs. There are no answers hers, just as there are no answers in real life - just hoping you make the best decision.Ed Harris, Amy Ryan, Morgan Freeman, John Ashton - I know I'll miss some great performance, but I can't list the whole cast.First, Mystic River, now Gone Baby Gone; I can't wait for the next Lehane novel to be brought to the screen - Shutter Island in 2009 - and I sure hope Ben Affleck is a big part of it.",9,5,11,4 November 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne kicks Spidey's Ass
","This is the summer of the 3's - Pirates 3, Shrek 3, Spidey 3, Rush Hour 3, Ocean's 3 (well, 13, but it's still the 3rd) and the ultimate 3 - The Bourne Ultimatum. I don't even have to wait until Rush hour 3 hits the theaters to know that none of these characters will be equal to to Jason Bourne.Pamela Landy (Joan Allen): This is Jason Bourne, the toughest target that you have ever tracked.Pamela Landy: He is really good at staying alive, and trying to kill him and failing... just pisses him off. Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Supremacy) has established himself as the King of the Action Films with this delight. The action never stops and carries you to places you have never been.Bourne belongs to my generation. Literate men in their 30's and 40's in 1990, when The Bourne Ultimatum came out, would not be caught dead without a copy. I devoured all 611 pages on a weekend just as young people do today with Harry Potter. We were raised in the Cold War, and some of us were actually Cold Warriors. Authors like Robert Ludlum and Tom Clancy spoke to us like no one else could. Matt Damon returns to portray our hero. Like in the two previous films, he IS Jason Bourne. He does it like no one else could. he keeps us fixed on the edge of our seats. Just when you think he is toast - he turns it around and keeps going! The man is amazing!David Strathairn and Joan Allen were great too, and I always like seeing Scott Glenn, and I loved that they brought back Frankie Potente if only for brief reminisces, but this was Mat Damon/Jason Bourne's film and he rocked my world.This IS the MUST SEE film of the Summer.",9,3,12,3 August 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," My insurance does not cover PMS!
","This is supposedly based upon some play by Shakespeare. Who cares? he is so last millennium. This is a fantastic and funny movie that was brilliantly written by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith. You can be sure that I will look for more of their work.I never came across Julia Stiles until the Bourne trilogy, and then I caught her in a quirky little film called The Business of Strangers. This performance here makes me want to see everything she has done. She was just fantastic and I am totally in love with her! Heath ledger was also perfect in this film. You can see why he became the star that he was until this week. I understand this film made him and you can certainly see why.If you want funny and romantic and cute, there isn't a better film.",8,3,4,23 January 2008
Notting Hill," Hugh Grant & Julia Roberts sparkle
","Can a common man ever expect to be in the company of a beautiful star? Maybe not in real life, but for the many that hope to ever do so this movie is a ray of hope.Hugh Grant was absolutely marvelous as a bookseller who bumps into Julia Roberts. She was equally fantastic in what I perceive to be her best performance since Pretty Woman.Rhys Ifans was absolutely over-the-top as his flatmate.As Lloyd Dobler said in 'Say Anything...' My goal in life is just to be with her. What a goal. Lloyd achieved it and so did William Thacker. There is hope! I would be remiss if I did not mention the fantastic music in this movie. It was just incredible. Shania Twain, Al Green, Bob Marley, and on and on. It was a perfect soundtrack. That seems to characterize all of the romantic comedies that Grant is in.Damn, this was one great movie!",8,1,4,16 March 2007
Léon: The Professional," Cleaners need love, too
","It is easy to praise the father-daughter relationship that Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) display in this dark and compelling film, but I feel that would be superficial.The relationship appeared to be much deeper - almost sexual - as the two tried to find some meaning in their lives.Leon was just slouching through life doing his job and not caring about much else. A wired cop (Gary Oldman) thrust Mathilda into his arms, and he became her protector and trainer. This relationship unfolded slowly and beautifully and was truly a joy to watch.Sure, there was action, but it framed the story, which was really about Leon and Mathilda. Reno and Portman were brilliant and aptly supported by Oldman and Danny Aiello.",9,1,5,4 May 2007
American Pie," God bless the Internet.
","I went into this thinking that it was going to be crude and filled with fart jokes, but I was really surprised. Sure, on the surface it is crude, but underneath was a very good story of young men trying to grow into adulthood.The hardest thing is picking whom I liked the most. Jason Biggs was great in his second film, but so was Chris Klein, who really grew, and Eddie Kaye Thomas (Harold & Kumar). And Mena Suvari (Kiss the Girls) was fantastic, as was Natasha Lyonne.It was a funny and, at times, very tender movie that was entertaining from start to finish. I'll have to check out the sequels.",7,0,2,7 March 2008
Burn After Reading," Put up a note? 'Highly classified sh*t found: Raw intelligence sh*t, CIA sh*t?' Hello, anybody lose their secret CIA sh*t? I don't think so!'
","There really doesn't seem to be much sense in what is going on. It is like Fargo in that respect. And, like Fargo, it is an opportunity for everyone to just have a good time and be funny.Brad Pitt is hilarious, and Frances McDormand is equally so. Together they just make this one of the funniest films about spies and murder and infidelity that you can imagine.George Clooney spends most of his time bedding as many women as he can, and he gets caught in the middle of Pitt and McDormands plans. His paranoia reaches new heights as things develop.There are many more great performances, by great I mean very funny, by John Malkovich, Richard Jenkins, David Rasche, and J.K. Simmons.",8,1,5,29 January 2009
Watchmen," I don't mind being the smartest man in the world, I just wish it wasn't this one.
","I won't begin to describe the situation, you have a synopsis for that. I want to focus on the experience itself.First, the film has the look and feel of a graphic novel. This should please fans of the book even if the film strays, or has to condense a lot of back story in a small time, as it appeared to do in the opening sequence.The visual effects were stunning, and the music and sound track were superb. Any film that includes Leonard Cohen singing 'Hallelujah' has got me.Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach was a joy to watch, as was Malin Åkerman as Silk Spectre II.Now, I have to get the soundtrack.",8,3,7,17 April 2010
The Bourne Identity," One of my favorites
","I have a whole stack of 2006 films to watch, but this came on again and I could not resist revisiting it even though I know what is going to happen. I remember reading this series when the books came out, and the movies remind me of that pleasure. Mat Damon is just fantastic in the role of Jason Bourne. Franka Potente is just so hot in a quiet way. I can't wait for a new film with her to come out. Chris cooper (Breach, Capote, Silver City) is also outstanding in this film.The car chase through the streets of Paris was fantastic! Only the Transporter can out drive Bourne. The action is non stop and intense. A super film!",9,1,2,14 April 2007
28 Weeks Later," I have a freakin' headache!
","This was the most incredibly pulse pounding adrenaline rush that I have ever experienced. The sound pumped through my ears as the tension pumped my heart and i literally jumped out of my seat with the excitement.Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo kept true to Danny Boyle's (Shallow Grave, 28 days Later) story and gave us a film that rocked all the way through.Catherine McCormack was incredible, and played convincingly, especially at the end. Robert Carlyle made a perfect a**hole. This is Imogen Poots' second film (V for Vendetta) and she is one to watch in the future. Those doe eyes will take her far.This is not a horror film. It is a film about the tough questions we will face if bio-terrorism ever takes hold. It is not a sequel. It stands on its own as the next step in the process.Pulse-pounding, not-to-be-missed, theatrical experience. Wait for the DVD at you own risk - you will be a loser!",6,1,8,21 May 2007
He Got Game," Not Spike's best; not his worst
","Director Spike Lee loves basketball. You can see him court side at Knicks games. A basketball movie fits right in with his love and this one starring Denzel Washington as a father let out of prison to convince his son to sign for the Governor's alma mater is not a bad movie. Of course Denzel's mission is complicated by the fact that he is in prison for killing his son's mother, and he named him 'Jesus.' Try to overcome that! But, we do get a good father-son movie in the attempt.Really, anytime we get to see Denzel is a good thing, and this also has Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) and Rosario Dawson (Sin City, Grindhouse), and birthday girl, Jennifer Esposito. Of course, crash is a better vehicle for seeing Jennifer, but this one was available for a birthday tribute.The only thing I don't like about Lee's movies is, that with few exceptions, he portrays all his female characters (in the current vernacular) as 'nappy headed ho's.' This one is no exception.",7,1,3,11 April 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Now, this was interesting
","The title sequence to this movie was one of the best that I have seen in years. It was fascinating and creative and it alone makes the entire movie worthwhile.The concept is also believable. I don't recall seeing something in a horror movie that I could truly believe happened. Knowing what we know now about the testing that was done with participants knowledge, we could see something like this for real. We may not, but at least it is possible and that makes the film interesting, too.Aaron Stanford took over this movie and really made it his own. He gave an outstanding performance, and I want to see more of him. Vinessa Shaw, Dan Byrd, and Emilie de Ravin also gave performances that were imminently watchable. hey, they even had Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine).",7,3,9,29 April 2007
American Psycho," Not quite blonde, are we? More of a dirty blonde.
","Mary Harron (The Notorious Bettie Page) writes and directs another great film that I am still trying to categorize.Christian Bale (Batman Begins, El Maquinista) is absolutely terrifying as someone who proceeds to rape, murder, and torture in gruesome ways without one bit of remorse. His filmed encounter with two prostitutes was revealing. He was so focused on himself! It was bizarre to see the self-absorption.I have no earthly idea what Reese Witherspoon (Walk the Line) is doing in this movie, but she is Bale's fiancée.Willem Dafoe (Spiderman) was creepily persistent. Did he know more than he let on? And just what happened? Did he do all this or just imagine it.I think I need another viewing.",8,0,4,1 June 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Putting the FUN in DysFUNctional
","Has this been a wacky month even for the Gunshine State! Tornadoes ripping through my County, a whacked out astronaut puts on her depends and acts spaced out, and a fellow Texan buys it in Hollywood - Florida, not California. Yes, Anna Nicole Smith was from Mexia, Texas.I cannot imagine a better setting than this to sit down and watch Little Miss Sunshine. This has to be the most dysfunctional family I have seen since the gang on Married with Children. Dad with his nine steps, grandpa the junkie, the gay uncle who tries to commit suicide, the son who hasn't spoken a word for nine months, and the daughter who resembles one of those American Idol losers that Simon Cowell has fun with trying to win a beauty pageant. This is a family only Al Bundy could love.Yet, it works. However dysfunctional they are, they manage to get it together in the end and one has to hope they will go on to a better life. Seldom have I seen such great writing, direction, and acting. This is a movie that one will enjoy over and over. I definitely belongs in your DVD collection.Having said that I wish all the best to Michael Arndt in his quest for an Academy Award for his screenplay. I do not think that anyone else has a chance. Little Miss Sunshine is a movie to enjoy and forget the awards.",8,1,6,10 February 2007
The Orphanage," A work of art
","Horror movies are horror movies. They can be good and bad. There are certain things that make them well worth watching.First, there is the cinematography of Óscar Faura, who did The Abandoned and The Machinist. The camera work in this film was nothing short of spectacular.Then, for a good horror movie, you have to have great sound. Xavier Mas, Marc Orts, and Oriol Tarragó took care to make sure the sound was fantastic.It helps to have a great director, and this film had a new one, Juan Antonio Bayona, who definitely is one to watch in the future. He transformed Sergio G. Sánchez's screenplay into an entertaining piece of horror.Belén Rueda (The Sea Inside) is not only a pleasure to look at, but she is a fantastic actress and was superb here. She got a lot a help from three-time Golden Globe nominee Geraldine Chaplin.A really spooky movie with a sweet ending.",8,2,5,14 May 2008
U-571," Flawed remake of a classic
","I was watching the 1981 film, Das Boot, the other night. The version that lasts just a shade under five hours. A tale of life on a submarine in war. Dirty, grimy, cramped terror in a way that only Wolfgang Peterson could present.Why would I want to see a remake that has so great a flaw to tell the story of the capture of the Enigma encoding machine by Americans. Anyone who knows history, knows that it was the British that captured that machine. Does Hollywood think we are stupid? I only tuned in to see Matthew McConaughey (Contact, A Time to Kill) and Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction). I enjoyed their performances in what was a flawed remake.",6,1,3,20 April 2007
The Shining," I'd give my god-damned soul for just a glass of beer.
","It took me a long time to see this film. I have never enjoyed horror. Yes, I would watch the occasional vampire or werewolf film, but I walked out of Blacula after 10 minutes when he went down the alley eating an arm.Recently, I have been exploring Italian, French and Spanish horror, as well as some old classics. I have a lot to catch up on as I never watched those Halloween flicks, or Friday the 13th films, or appreciated zombie films. I am exploring torture porn and zombies and can now watch a mutant eat flesh as I did the other day in Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain; although it looked more like a breast implant than flesh.I rambled on just so you know why I have not seen this classic until now. I am sorry I waited, as it was just about the best horror film I have seen to date. No, there is little gore and no WB actors; it is classic horror. Jack Nicholson gave the best horror performance I have seen from him since Wolf. Watching his transformation was captivating. There was pure terror in this film; especially from Shelley Duvall, who's voice got on my nerves. Scatman Crothers was really good, and Lia Beldam was amazing in her only film role. Well, she was amazing for a minute or two.This is real horror.",8,1,2,5 September 2007
"I, Robot"," Good remake of Planet of the Apes story
","I know that there are probably a lot of people who watched I, Robot just to gawk at Will Smith's bod. I'll admit, it was nothing short of perfect, but after the short time you get to view it, there is still a story to contend with. Anyway, I was more fascinated with Bridget Moynahan, and wanted to rush out to see Lord of War to see more of her. (If I had known her, I would have wished her Happy Birthday last Thursday.) I hope to see more of her in the future. I though she gave an excellent performance in what was an entertaining action movie. Never mind the preaching about how we are going to destroy ourselves - which we will, or the fact that Smith's character got Asimov all backwards by suggesting that emotions are better than logic, it was just a darn good remake of the Planet of the Apes series.",8,0,1,25 September 2005
American Beauty," It's just a couch!
","When did it happen that we became so obsessed over possessions and what other people thought that it ruled our lives? Was it always this way? One day Lester (Kevin Spacey) wakes up and realizes that 'It's just a couch!' Only then could he move down the road that led to true happiness. Unfortunately, it proved to be too late, as he came in contact with another (Chris Cooper) who was so wrapped up in hiding who he really was that he drove away his son and turned his wife into a zombie (an unrecognizable Allison Janney).It was also too late for his wife (Annette Bening) who realized too late that she was consumed with success and had estranged herself from her family.Super performance by the above and also Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari.Watch this film before it is too late for you.",10,3,7,20 October 2007
Wanted," Wanted's Best Body Parts
","Don't kid yourself. Nobody went to this film to see any of the actors listed before Angelina, and the studios knew it. Are there posters of trailers that feature James McAvoy? Who is he anyway? I saw one site that said they are thinking trilogy; that he is the next Bourne. Give me a break! McAvoy compared to Matt Damon. Unbelievable.What was the best feature of this movie? Hands down, it is Angelina Jolie's lips. Director Timur Bekmambetov made sure that there were plenty of closeups of these luscious parts. Men melted in the aisles as they came to the screen Next, it was her warm green eyes. They just grab you and won't let go. Unfortunately for McAvoy, they can also trap you into doing things that are wrong.Angelina's trigger finger is not to be overlooked. She proves that she is a capable match for any bad guy and Willis or Thurman have nothing on her.McAvoy got a real closeup of Jolie's uterus when she was splayed on the hood. But only Shiloh Jolie-Pittand whoever else is in thereknows what it's really like. Lookie James, but no touchee.Everyone is focuses on Jolie's breast when their eyes stray from the lips. Not on full display in this film, but check out Taking Lives, Original Sin, and, of course, Gia for more information.It is Jolie's heart that captivates many, and she showed a little when she came to McAvoy's aid in shutting up his girlfriend. The World knows that heart well.Despite the 20 minute set up in this movie, we really can't focus on McAvoy. There is likely to be a sequel (please, no trilogy) and it will likely feature Jolie again. We can only hope.",7,3,8,5 July 2008
Judgment at Nuremberg," Hollywood's best in an important film
","It is so easy to dismiss this as a story of other people in another time in another land. Unfortunately, what was done then, is being done by the leaders of our country in the name of protection from terrorists, and we, the people, sit silently by and let it happen just as the German people did seven decades ago.We need to watch films like this over and over to remind us of what is important and what we, as civilized humans, can be reduced to out of fear.This is another great film by the fantastic Abby Mann, who died last month. He won an Oscar for his screenplay, and it was well deserved.Maximilian Schell was simply fantastic, as was Spencer Tracy, Montgomery Clift, and Judy Garland. Director Stanley Kramer brought out the best in these actors, and others like Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, William Shatner, and Werner Klemperer.Don't look upon it as three hours of cinema, but as a class in humanity as only Abby Mann could write.",8,2,2,11 April 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," The wrong kid died / The wrong kid died...
","I have only walked out on one film in my life. This almost became the second. It was that bad.John C. Reilly has to be given credit for delivering the lines in this film with a straight face. I couldn't have done it.The dialog was plain cringe inducing. Only a tweener boy would find the lines remotely funny. The only thing resembling humor were the drug lines, and a tweener wouldn't have gotten what was so funny about them.This film ranks with Beerfest as the lowest of the low.Raymond J. Barry as Pa Cox, and Jenna Fischer as Darlene were the only redeeming lights in this otherwise unfunny movie.",4,0,3,28 October 2008
Apocalypse Now," Oh man, the sh*t piled up so fast in Vietnam you needed wings to stay above it.
","This film deserved every single award it got, and deserved some that it didn't get. The winners for Best Picture and Best Director and best supporting Actor paled in comparison to this film and Driector Francis Ford Coppola, and Robert Duvall's portrayal as Lt Col Kilgore.Duvall's performance was just one of some really great performances in this film. Martin Sheen held it all together; a young Laurence Fishburne, Albert Hall, Aurore Clément in her prime, Dennis Hopper, so many more that it is hard to mention them. Naturally, we have to mention the absolutely brilliant performance of Marlon Brando.The music and cinematography were first rate, worthy of the many accolades they received. 'The Ride of the Valkyries' will forever be associated with this film.The stunt work was also superb.Every aspect of this film stands out as a classic right up there with Gone With the Wind.",10,0,4,15 February 2009
The Battle of Algiers," We aren't madmen or sadists, gentlemen. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win.
","This film received Oscar nominations in 1967 and 1969. First time I have ever seen that.It was nominated in 1967 for Best Foreign Language Film, losing to A Man and a Woman; and was nominated again in 1969, when Gillo Pontecorvo was nominated for Best Director, and he was nominated along with Franco Solinas for Screenplay.It shows up on many Top Ten lists as it illustrates the timeless march of men fighting for their basic human rights and freedom. It could be a film about the West Bank or Afghanistan, or any other locale where men struggle to be free. It just happened here to occur in Algeria. This is a timeless film about freedom and the horrors of war.One of the interesting aspects of this film is how real it looks and feels. This is done without using stock footage. It was filmed that way, and presents a picture of war that is hard to stomach. It will make all other so-called 'war movies' seem like cartoons.Jean Martin as Col. Mathieu was outstanding, especially when he was defending the use of Bush-Cheney tactics to defeat the Algerians.One has to realize watching this film that the Algerians didn't like being occupied by the French any more than the French like being occupied by the Nazis or Iraq likes being occupied by America.",9,1,2,14 March 2010
The Patriot," Viva la revolution!
","There is a great old 1965 Jimmy Stewart movie called Shenandoah about a father that finds his family in the middle of the Civil War. The Patriot is basically the same story updated with a different war. They are both worth watching.Mel Gibson plays the father (with a military past he is trying to forget) who is just trying to runs a farm and avoid conflict. Neesdless to say that is not going to happen as his sons get drawn into the battle. The old warrior comes back and starts fighting the British.Heath Ledger plays one of his sons, while the ever lovely Joely Richardson plays his sister-in-law (wife is dead). Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy from Harry Potter) plays the bad guy. Is that a surprise? The cast list has several other great players, and you will likely find one that you enjoy.Good movie about the period.",7,0,8,20 April 2007
Van Helsing," Rings of garlic... holy water... silver stake... crucifix...
","The opening to this movie was classic. I really liked seeing the villagers storming the castle to kill Dr. Frankenstein and his creation. But, what was Dracula doing there? We quickly switch to a really strange Jekyll/Hyde that looks something out of Jack and the Beanstalk, and a secret order of the Catholic Church that employs Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) to fulfill their mission of stamping out evil in the world (minus the priests that prey on boys, of course). There is even a James Bond type Q Branch with new weapons. It is obvious that this is not going to be your father's Dracula/Van Helsing movie.The action is fast, the costuming, sound, CGI, and makeup are first rate. Dracula is brought into the 21st Century with a bang. But, is that bang worth the time? Well, the fire works were amazing and the flying creatures were stunningly beautiful. There was even a 'Birds' segment with bats instead really cool.Shuler Hensley made a great Frankenstein's Monster, and, of course, there is always Kate Beckinsale, a welcome sight in any movie.Mummy master Stephen Sommers wrote and directed an exciting film.",6,0,0,2 March 2008
The White Ribbon," I gave God a chance to kill me.
","Tons of accolades for this film: an Oscar nominee, BAFTA nominee, Caesar nominee, triple award winner at Cannes, and many many more.Michael Haneke makes films that make you think. He doesn't give you the answers. Remember Cache and Funny Games? This film is no different.Accidents(?) happen and we don't have easy answers. Where is the evil coming from? What will be our response? Usually the response is an increase in authoritarianism. Witness the easy manner in which many Americans were willing to give up their hard won freedom after 9/11 to obtain some quieting of their fear. It is the same everywhere. We do not see the rise of fascism in the film, but we see the seeds being sown.The children grow up in a paternalistic highly religious society where rich and poor are strictly separated. Children are punished for the slightest infraction, while the adults practice adultery and incest with impunity. There is no love shown anywhere except between the teacher and the nanny.These are the children that will become the Nazis of the future. Is it this upbringing that caused that? This seems to be what Haneke is trying to say, but he leaves it to us to sort it out.The film was riveting and the time flew by as we looked at clues to determine who was the source of evil. We will not know, as Heneke leaves that to us also.The acting was superb, and the cinematography was outstanding.",8,6,18,24 July 2010
In the Name of the Father," It is shocking new evidence.
","With seven Oscar nominations, this film had the unfortunate luck to be competing in a remarkable year for films and won not a single one.It is a shame because director Jim Sheridan gave us a film that transcends the subject matter and was a delight to watch. The performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Emma Thompson, and Pete Postlethwaite were simply incredible, and I even got a minute or two of Saffron Burrows as a London hippie.What makes this film so much more that a slam at British injustice in the face of terror, is that it is also a portrait of American injustice against Blacks. In the haste to get convictions and convince the public that they are competent, both systems use the same techniques.What is also common to both systems is the fact that after gross injustice is discovered, the prosecutors and police escape unharmed; while the lives of their victims are ruined forever.",8,1,4,27 March 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A 40 year old virgin? Yeah, right.
","The premise is unbelievable, but very funny. How can a man, in the time when nearly half of high school students and one in five middle school students said they have had sexual intercourse, be a virgin at 40. Maybe it's something in the packaging of those action figures. Hey, Star Wars geeks, the packaging is bad for you!Yes, I know, I am probably the last person in America that has seen The 40 Year Old Virgin. I am not a Steve Carell fan. Dude, you don't watch The Office? No, I don't; there was always something better on. Let's just put our cards on the table, I don't watch Arrested Development, either, so there. Although, I don't know what that has to do with it. I just felt like getting it off my chest. I did like Carell as Uncle Authur in Bewitched, which I only watched because I am a Nicole Kidman fan. But, that's it. Nothing else. Sorry.Neither have I seen Paul Rudd in anything but Friends, and was a virgin on all the other characters, with the exception of Catherine Keener, whom I've seen in The Interpreter, S1m0ne, and Out of Sight, and who I hope to see soon in The Ballad of Jack and Rose, which I immediately ordered, and Capote, when it gets to the hinterlands. She is definitely a fine actress that deserves all the awards and nominations coming her way.Having said all that, I thought the film was great and I really like Carell's performance. It doesn't mean I'll rush out and see Get Smart, but I may take a look at The Office and Little Miss Sunshine does sound interesting.",9,2,7,4 February 2006
Face_Off," Excellent action thriller
","Writer/director Quentin Tarantino refers to John Woo as 'the most exciting director to emerge in action cinema since Sergio Leone.' And VARIETY calls the Hong Kong director 'the Mozart of Mayhem.' Action and Mayhem are what you will find in this film with John Travolta and Nicolas cage. They play in perfect tandem and one could not imagine anyone else in the roles.Woo's direction is flawless and you can see his earlier works reborn - the emotion of The Killer and the action of Hard Boiled - in this film.An interesting supporting cast includes Margaret Cho, CCH Pounder and Gina Gershon.",8,2,4,1 May 2007
Jarhead," The politics of war
","I was fascinated by the indoctrination of the Marines before they were ever sent to war.It seems that they take great pains to build them into a unit that performs its mission without question.It was sad to see what happened when they were sent to Desert Storm. Over six months in the desert heat and nothing to show for it. Lives lost to friendly fire, marriages and relationships destroyed. An unending tale of disease from the atmosphere over there, and they never even used the training they received.This film had a lot of stars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jamie Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, Lucas Black, Chris Cooper, and Dennis Haysbert, but it wasn't about the characters, it was about the futility of it all. That makes it worthwhile viewing.",7,1,1,4 May 2007
The Machinist," Well, don't look so surprised. Even a call girl can scramble an egg.
","Christian Bale (Batman Begins) rocks in the Brad Anderson (Session 9) film about a man (Trevor) who not only hasn't slept in a year, but is losing weight because of it and looks like he has an eating disorder. He could almost joint the cast of thin the way he looks. bale reportedly lost 70 pounds for this film.I was ready to recommend the diet before the ending, which is dynamite. I think I;ll pass now that I know why he hasn't slept. It was totally unexpected.Jennifer Jason Leigh, a totally gorgeous woman, really is in character in this film as a prostitute. She has the hard look and is totally not attractive, but has a heart of gold. Isn't that trite; sort of Jamie Lee Curtis in Trading Places.European actress Aitana Sánchez-Gijón is also outstanding and a key part of the mystery as to why Trevor is not sleeping.John Sharian (Romasanta) plays a creepy part. I think I figured out who/what he was, but I won't say as it will give away the plot.Brilliantly shot in mostly black and white with just an appropriate hint of color.",10,5,8,21 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Happy Birthday Julie
","I have seen a lot of movies over the years with Julie Christie. My favorite is Heaven Can Wait. But, her role in this movie is the very antithesis of the lovely Julie, that it is appropriate on her birthday.She played Madame Rosmerta, a minor role in a great film with the usual cast of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Yes, I watch harry Potter movies. I have even read all the books three times each and anxiously await the next book and movie. Life is too interesting to get stuck in just a few types; whether it be books, music, movies, or women.This was director Alfonso Cuarón's (Y tu mamá también ) greatest film. He was actually supposed to do Children of Men when he was offered this one.",8,0,3,14 April 2007
Ratatouille," Ah, but that is no match for wishful thinking. If you focus on what you left behind. You will never be able to see what lies ahead. Now go up and look around.
","I, of course, will be biased in my review of this film. As a food lover, I can relate well to Remy and his search for food that explodes in your mouth with taste.Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava have created one of the funniest movies I have seen - and it stars a rat! How anyone can make a rat appealing is beyond me, but they have done it. The story flows as if it starred real humans, but the fact that it is animated makes it even more appealing.It has constant humor amidst the deviousness of the chef. Along with that, we get a very positive message about challenging ourselves to keep pushing the envelope.It is not just a cartoon for kiddies, but an enjoyable film for all ages. It should definitely have a sequel.",9,1,2,15 March 2009
Aliens," They're coming outta the walls. They're coming outta the goddamn walls, we're f*cked!
","Again, it would take me all night to talk about the awards this film won and was nominated for. Suffice it to say that James Cameron directed a masterpiece of sci-fi horror.Although she didn't wear those skimpy panties that showed some ass cleavage in Alien, Sigourney Weaver was just as hot in her grey underwear and she kicked some major butt in this film.I was initially turned off with all the military hoorah that was going on in the beginning, but the film turned out to be even better than the first. There was some real horror to go along with major suspense and, even though I had to go so bad I almost wet myself, I could not tear myself away for the last 20 minutes. It was f*ucking awesome! Lance Henriksen was also great, and i look forward to seeing more of him. You know I will be looking for Alien 3 and 4!",9,4,6,17 June 2007
Control," So this is permanence; love-shattered pride. What once was innocence, has turned on its side.
","I enjoy musical biopics even when I have no idea who the person is. I am not into the type of rock Ian Curtis sang. he would be better enjoyed by those who are emo fans, as he is credited with being the father of that genre. But I was captivated by listening to the lyrics, especially as I saw his life unfold.He married too young, was not ready to be a father, and really didn't understand love. So, what makes him different from the rest of us besides the fact that he fronted a band for a short time? Really, nothing. He shares the same problems the rest of us have, save one. He developed epilepsy in his early twenties, and had the fear of a worsening disease on top of all his other problems.You could hear it in his music. He knew that he was losing all control over his life and he wanted to take final control. You could feel his pain and know that maybe you were a little lucky with your problems in that you can still have some control, but you also could know that maybe he was a little lucky to have his star shine even for a brief time.",8,2,3,8 June 2008
Gandhi," If you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.
","There are not enough superlatives to describe this film and the performances of the actors in it. It takes a superlative film to chronicle the life of a superlative man. It takes superlative actors and acting to tell us the story of the life of a real man whom we can only dream of following. Most of us are not worthy to kiss his sandals.Richard Attenborough gave us a memorable performance as Kris Kringle on Miracle on 34th Street, but he gave us so much more as director of this film. He kept us glued to the screen for the entire 188 minutes, and made a film that we return to over and over.Ben Kingsley was outstanding in House of Sand and Fog, Sexy Beast, and Bugsy, but he was head and shoulders above in his role as Gandhi. His performance helped us understand the man who gave everything for others.The cast included some many stars that to mention a few is to slight others: Edward Fox (A Bridge Too Far), John Gielgud (Arthur), John Mills (Ryan's Daughter), Saeed Jaffrey (My Beautiful Laundrette), Trevor Howard (Sons and Lovers), Martin Sheen (Apocalypse Now ), and Daniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot, Gangs of New York, In the Name of the Father).And, of course, Candice Bergen as Margaret Bourke-White, who chronicles Ghandhi's life in pictures. While Many will recognize her for Murphy Brown and Boston Legal, it is her work in this film that etches her in my memory.",9,2,3,9 May 2007
Saw III," Hello, America. Do you wanna play a game?
","Yes, I know that the future of torture porn has been declared dead. That does not mean that it is not worth watching. In fact, amid the intense pain and suffering is what could be called some socially redeeming value.Who among us has not been wronged in the past? How many of us torture ourselves with those memories and vow to get revenge? How many of us are crippled because we won't let go of those who wronged us? Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) was doing the people he tortured a favor by exposing them to the demons that possesses their lives and helped them release those demons. Maybe he went a little far to prove a point, but he had some pure motives.Enough moralizing. The movie was creative and exciting. The devices were ingenious and I am sure the CIA is using these films as training material for their own torture operations. Forget the blood, the chopped up pigs was brilliant. Yech! How disgusting! Can't wait to see number IV.",6,0,0,12 February 2008
Ocean's Eleven," You're a thief and a liar.
","I love caper films, and this is one of the best. But, it is more than that. It is also a great love story. Not the mushy kind that appears on Lifetime, but one that really tugs at you. George Clooney and Julia Roberts are delightful in a superb cast of characters.Thie isn't just one caper, but 11 of them, any one of which could fail easily and bring the whole thing crashing down. It is really exciting to see the pieces fall into place as Andy Garcia gets his from the likes of Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Don Cheadle, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Elliott Gould, Eddie Jemison , Bernie Mac, Brad Pitt, Shaobo Qin , and Carl Reiner.Steven Soderbergh is the man.",8,1,2,9 September 2007
Underground," Once upon a time there was a country
","How about a musical Sunday? I started out with this surreal Palme d'Or winner from the Cannes Film Festival by Emir Kusturica. Taking us through WWII, The Communist regime, and the Bosnian War, it is an allegory about lies.Slapstick and politics. Quite a combination, but in this case it works magnificently. The low brow humor and the gypsy music combine with a statement about a country that cut its people off from the rest of the world for 45 years. Just like Marko did to Blacky, the people were kept underground, oblivious to the changes in the world.The acting was superb, and the continuous gypsy music underscored a great tragedy.",8,5,11,22 June 2008
Resident Evil," You're all going to die down here.
","I am sure that this would have been a much better film had George Romero (Night of the Living Dead) signed on, but I don't take anything away from Paul W.S. Anderson, who did a good job despite lack of experience with zombies.I did a double feature last night to prepare for the third film in this series. No, I haven't done video games since Pacman, so I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed Milla Jovovich and, of course, am always happy to see Michelle Rodriguez.I have only come into zombies recently, so I was not aware that this film brought the genre back after a long absence. It is to be praised and revered for that, if nothing else.Now, in the next film, I hope there is a little more zombie and less sci-fi.",6,6,11,21 September 2007
Quantum of Solace," The Americans are gonna be none too pleased.
","Not only the Americans, but James Bond purists will be unhappy at an effort to create another action hero like Jason Bourne. This is not the James Bond we grew up with, but a caricature that spends most of his time in polo shirts instead of tuxedos. He really has nothing of substance to say throughout the film; he just bashes one head after another. The Governator does a better job of that, as evidenced in Commando.Some will certainly note the distinctive Anti-American theme running through the film, but that is not a bother since it's the government that is criticized, and rightly so for it's support of right-wing dictators when it suits them.As an action film, it was exciting and worth watching. I just expect something more sophisticated from Bond, and Olga Kurylenko was really wasted.The opening song was the worst Bond song ever. No class.",6,2,12,4 July 2009
Independence Day," I picked a helluva day to quit drinkin'.
","I go back and visit this film occasionally as it has all the qualifications for real entertainment.Roland Emmerich, who did Stargate and Godzilla, knows how to put together a film that incorporates great sound, and special effects, with some pretty good acting to boot.Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Judd Hirsch all performed well and kept us interested. They were ably supported by some stars as Randy Quaid, Mary McDonnell and Robert Loggia. In addition, there were some fine beauties sprinkled through the film: Vivica A. Fox as an exotic dancer in her thong; Kiersten Warren and KImberly Beck both appeared in small parts, but their beauty did not go unnoticed.So, overlook the obvious plot holes that come with this kind of movie, pop some corn and just enjoy.",6,1,4,21 August 2007
The Dirty Dozen," Killin' generals could get to be a habit with me.
","Another great film from 1967 that stands the test of time.No one would ever believe in a story about a bunch of losers going into some German High Command and killing off Generals in exchange for their freedom. Pure fantasy! Yet, this is one of the greatest and most successful war movies ever made.Robert Aldrich (What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?) directed a masterpiece written by Nunnally Johnson (The Grapes of Wrath).The cast was outstanding with Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, George Kennedy, John Cassavetes, Clint Walker, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, Ralph Meeker, Richard Jaeckel, Trini Lopez, and Robert Webber. That's more testosterone than you find on a Super Bowl Team! Sensational.",9,4,8,22 May 2007
No Country for Old Men," You can't stop what's coming.
","West Texas is a perfect setting for a movie like this -- no trees, just desolate land for miles around. The chicken farmer (Richard Jackson) was from Alpine -a place in the middle of nowhere with a long long stretch of road that literally - I kid you not - has turkey buzzards on the fence posts along the way. Annie Proulx (Brokeback Mountain) described it perfectly in her 2002 book, 'That Old Ace in the Hole.' I've been gone from there for five years, but it hadn't changed much from the 1980 setting in the film, an I suspect it hasn't changed much more.Llewelyn Moss, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin (Grindhouse, Hollow Man) thought he hit the jackpot. But, he didn't account for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh was methodical, intelligent and psychotic. He is the human equivalent of the terminator robot after John Conner. Those who believe in souls would not say that Chigurg has one.Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, U.S. Marshals) is a tired sheriff that comes from a long line of lawmen. He knows that he is no match for Chigurg. It's not Richard Kimble or Mark Sheridan he's chasing, but a man who has no match.The dialog is dry and things are not always explained. There is constant tension knowing what may lie on the other side of the door.Jones' buddy Ellis had it down: Whatcha got ain't nothing new. 'This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.' Dying with your boots on is still dying.",10,3,6,28 January 2008
District 9," I can't believe I get paid to do this. I love watching you prawns die.
","I certainly went into the Golden Globe nominated film with no expectations. I was intrigued by the concept of presenting a science fiction film in documentary style.Yes, I realize that the story parallels South Africa's treatment of the black population.Sharlto Copley (in The A-Team later this year) is great as a clueless bureaucrat who finds himself siding with the aliens after he is infected.There is plenty of military action for those that enjoy that, and some gore for those who want that. There are Nigerian hookers who service the aliens, but you have to use your imagination for that.The film examines many of our anxieties like race relations, class differences, corporate greed, cable news and the world of reality TV.",8,0,3,17 January 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," You're gonna break a lot of hearts.
","Thanks to the Venice Film Festival for being the only ones that recognized that the real star of this artistic masterpiece is Brad Pitt, not Casey Affleck.This is another western that doesn't fit the mold. It is an art film in every sense of the word. From the brilliant cinematography by Roger Deakins, a seven-time Oscar nominee (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Shawshank Redemption, The Man Who Wasn't There, Kundun, and this film), to the superb acting in an ensemble that provide a thrilling experience for 160 minutes.Yes, Affleck was very good, and probably gave the performance of his career, but Pitt was clearly the star as Jesse James, a man possessed. He could go from friend to unemotional killer in an instant. He possessed an uncanny ability to discern the thoughts of others. He knew his time was over and committed suicide the only way he could.The film was an interesting study of the celebrity cult that we experience today. Ford would have been right at home in People, or Entertainment Weekly, as someone who had style, but no substance.If you are looking for bang, bang, shoot-em-up, look elsewhere. This is a film to be watched and studied.",9,3,7,20 April 2008
Remember the Titans," An Easter Story
","Of course, I had seen it before, but to re-watch Remember the Titans on Good Friday was appropriate. Some may call it sacrilegious to compare the resurrection of Jesus to the resurrection of a Virginia town through football, but I see the Easter story in this movie. The self-importance exhibited by the Pharisees and the resulting hatred of those different, was no different from the hate exhibited by the town fathers in Virginia. The insistence of brotherhood by the coach, as played magnificently by Denzel Washington, resulted in a rebirth of the town - a resurrection from the hatred that blinded, and sometimes still blinds, the sons of the Old South. None of us is perfect, but we can all come together and form a perfect society. That was the vision of Jesus and the vision of our forefathers. Remember the Titans reminds us of what we can accomplish if we try - and if we try with love.",8,1,2,16 April 2006
Batman Begins," You are just an ordinary man in a cape!
","I just do not believe that it is possible to gather a cast that includes the definitive Batman Christian Bale (El Maquinista), the perfect butler Michael Caine (Children of Men), the imposing Liam Neeson (Gangs of New York), the always watchable Morgan Freeman (Danny the Dog), the good cop Gary Oldman (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), the superb Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), the strong and sexy Katie Holmes (Phone Booth), and the creepy Cillian Murphy (Red Eye) under the direction of Christopher Nolan and not have a winner.I have never enjoyed Batman so much as I did in this film. It was exciting from start to finish and my heart was still pounding after I left the theater.",9,1,4,25 May 2007
Twilight," What did you expect? Coffins and dungeons and moats?
","I wanted to be fair in reviewing this movie, but the forces were lined up against that.First, one sight recommended it for those who liked Jumper, Ghost Rider, or Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. That automatically set alarm bells ringing.Second, it is supposedly a Vampire story, but there is no blood. Duh! Third, almost every reviewer that loved it starts off talking about the books. Books are book, and films are films - two different art forms. They should NEVER be compared! Fourth, the awards it has won were at the MTV Movie Awards and the Teen Choice Awards - both the kiss of death for a film worth watching. It was not even nominated for one serious award.With all that lined up against it, it is hard to be objective, yet I tried.Bottom line: If you are a girl between 9-12, you will love this. I needed an insulin shot afterward.",4,2,5,1 February 2010
Before Sunset," Life is what happens when you are making other plans
","I am so in love with Celine. She is the perfect woman - caring concerned, intelligent - I could listen to her forever. And, take her and put Juile Delpy's voice into her and i am in heaven. Delpy (Hoax, Broken Flowers) turns in an enchanting performance with Ethan Hawke (Training Day), as two lovers who lost each other nine years ago and meet again in Paris.It is obvious from the start that Jesse (Hawke) has never went a day without regretting what happened. Celine appears to shrug it off but, no matter how hard she tries, it comes out that her life has also been affected. The entire film is a conversation between the two that says so much. I know the century is young, but this is definitely one of the best films so far.Director Richard Linklater (screenplay/story) , Julie Delpy(screenplay) , Ethan Hawke (screenplay) , and Kim Krizan (story) have written a wonderful film that will stand the test of time.",9,5,7,6 April 2007
The Pianist," It's an official decree, no Jews allowed in the parks.
","I have watched a lot of WWII films, but this is at the top of the list.Don't take my word for it, it won three Oscars, and should have won Best Picture; it did win Best Picture at the BAFTA awards, along with a Best Director for Roman Polanski (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby). This is Polanski's finest film by far.Adrien Brody was magnificent, and his performance made you feel you were right there with him.It wasn't a pretty picture, the outstanding cinematography notwithstanding. Bodies lie in the streets, and people just passed them by. People were shot for asking a simple question. A man was so hungry that when his attempt to steal a woman's soup resulted in it falling to the ground, he fell to the ground and lapped it up.Amidst all the carnage and deprivation, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) managed to survive until the end. An amazing story.",9,2,3,28 May 2010
Revolutionary Road," Are you going to hit me? To show me how much you love me?
","Three Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe for Kate Winslet, who had two superior performances in one year.The streets are full of machines: men who wear the same white shirts and skinny ties and the same hats, marching to the same mindless jobs.Ther are so many interesting thoughts and ideas from the past in this film: the patriarchal society, a normal woman doesn't think about abortion, secretaries are for entertainment, electroshock therapy, just to name a few that caused yelling and screaming between Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet).I took particular note of the 'your father would be so proud' argument to seal the deal.Michael Shannon as the son of Helen (Kathy Bates) and Howard (Richard Easton) acts as a mirror that brings out the truth in this dysfunctional relationship, this sham of a marriage that Frank and April have.I am still reflecting on the ending, but it is the only way it could have happened.Great performances by all, especially Winslet.",8,0,0,4 September 2009

","Big decision time. Hot Fuzz is 45 minutes away tomorrow, and 28 Weeks Later is right next door. Drive or walk? I decided to re-watch this film to help me make up my mind.Director Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave) has put together another suspenseful film. This time with with blood-crazed psychopaths infected with a terrible virus. Alex Garland's script was superb as there wasn't a minute wasted in telling this fascinating story.Cillian Murphy (Red Eye) and Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest)did a superb job.Too bad they won't be in the sequel and that makes up my mind.",7,0,3,10 May 2007

I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit.It should come as no surprise to anyone who glances at my reviews that I am in love with actors like Chow Yun-Fat (Curse of the Golden Flower, Pirates 3), Michelle Yeoh (Jet Li's Fearless, Tomorrow Never Dies), and Ziyi Zhang (2046, Memoirs of a Geisha ). To have all three in an absolutely beautiful film with Oscar-winning art and set decoration, cinematography, and music, is a rare thrill.Director Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) created a masterpiece. This film, and that other great film of 2000, Gladiator, took turns picking up statues at the 2001 Academy Awards. I*f you thought the cinematography and music of Gladiator were great - and they were! - then you will definitely want to check out this film.The quality of this film can be easily quantified: Won 4 Oscars. Another 70 wins & 84 nominations. Need we say more?",8,1,3,3 August 2007
JFK," The military-industrial complex
","Eisenhower warned us about the military-industrial complex. It was not well know at the time of Kennedy's presidency. Oliver Stone presents a long and confusing argument that it was behind Kennedy's assassination. The film show Keven Costner as Jim Garrson battling the US Government and it's cronies: the ultra-right-wing fanatics represented in the movie by Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), some unidentified Cuban exiles and a former F.B.I. man named Guy Bannister (Ed Asner). Also involved are various fringe types like David Ferrie (Joe Pesci), a pilot for hire; the small-time mobster Jack Ruby (Brian Doyle Murray), and Oswald (Gary Oldman), whose place in the conspiracy has become utterly mysterious by the time the movie ends.Garrison would have had an easier time convincing a jury today as the Iraq war is the very embodiment of the military-industrial complex. WhatStone suggests was behind Kennedy's death is business-as-usual in Washington. We start wars to sell bombs.It was unfortunate that Stone's film came up against The Silence of the Lambs, which cleared the table at the Academy Awards. He took home two, but lost four times that many. It was a great film to go back and see. It was a reminder of a different age. An age when the Judge, the lawyers, and the defendants sat there cooling smoking as the trial went on. Bizarre.",8,2,14,17 March 2007
Peaceful Warrior," This moment is the only thing that matters.
","OK, I'll admit it. The only reason I watched this movie was another chance to see Amy Smart (Crank) and Agnes Bruckner (The Woods). A sports movie about gymnastics would not normally appeal to me.But, this is not really a sports movie. It is a movie about spirituality. Not too terrible different from The Karate Kid, with Nick Nolte (Socrates) as the Mr. Miyagi character and Scott Mechlowicz as the student, here Dan instead of Daniel.It's all about finding yourself instead of chasing after what everyone expects you to do. If you just forget the past and future (taking out the trash as Socrates says), and focus on the present, you can do great things. There is Buddhist awareness as Socrates tells Dan there is never not anything happening and shows his how to be aware of the moment.So, forget the booze, and meat, and sex and you, too, can be great. But, who would want to? You've seen it before, but I really prefer these actors to the one in The Karate Kid, and you get to see Smart and Bruckner, too.",6,1,3,13 April 2008
The Number 23," Nasty Evil Dead Dog
","I know that Jim Carrey is nominated, along with Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, and Nickolas Cage for Worst Actor of the Year, but I really think that he gave a good performance in this interesting film - and this coming from someone who can't stand him! This was a good old fashioned Gothic type horror film that was worthy of Vincent Price. I say that because i was glued to the screen trying to figure it out and was really surprised at the solution - the ending sucked.Virginia Madsen (Sideways) is always a pleasure to watch and she was really good as Carrey's wife. And, I do love Rhona Mitra, even if she was in that Ali G crap.Well worth watching.",6,0,2,26 January 2008
Velvet Goldmine," That man sitting over there in the white suit... is the biggest thing to come out of this country since sliced Beatles
","I have to admit that I totally missed the whole Glam Rock experience. I spent the seventies immersed in R&B. That said, I have to say that Todd Haynes' film was absolutely fabulous and a real pleasure, both visually and aurally.The music was excellent, and the costuming was definitely Oscar worthy.I thought Christian Bale really nailed his part, as he always does, and Toni Collette, as Brian's (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) wife was the best I recall seeing her. Of course, Meyers made the film, and gave a look at the phenomenon that was indescribable.I certainly always enjoy Eddie Izzard, and he was perfect as the agent who made Brian a star. Ewan McGregor as Curt Wild was amazing.This was a real pleasurable experience and an interesting look at rock history.",8,2,3,14 February 2009
Ghost Rider," Raise no more devils than you can lay down.
","I just don't get it. Maybe I should lay down two bits for the comic book. Comics still cost a quarter, right? A quarter may be what this film is worth. Just because you have a comic, it doesn't mean it's worth putting on film. Look at the Jetsons, for example. There isn't enough story her to carry the film and make it interesting.The only thing that was interesting was Eva Mendes (Hitch, Training Day). Wearing a shirt two sizes too small that looked like it was going t bust at any moment, she was hot - and, she can act. She did a terrific job.The rest? Not at all interesting.",4,1,3,13 December 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Getting the cure so you can go home to mommy and daddy?
","I really could not help thinking throughout this movie about gays and lesbians. This movie was so much about acceptance and about a 'cure,' that is is a natural jump to acceptance of gays and lesbians and the so-called 'cure' that some right-wing religious groups are promoting. I know it is not a political movie, but maybe that is what the writers had in mind. I don't know, but it certainly affected my viewing.Of course, the reason I even watched the movie was Halle Barry. I realize that many watch it for Hugh Jackman, and that is cool, because he was great in this as he has been in the previous two. Berry, of course, is to die for.Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen were also great. Really, the whole cats was good. I could not criticize any of them.I just cannot get the picture of Rebecca Romijn lying on the floor of the truck and being rejected by those who used to be her friends. Even the rejected reject. It's a shame.Will watch again.",6,1,2,2 June 2007
The Lives of Others," For the many unsung heroes who resisted the Communist regime,
","An absolutely brilliant film by writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. His first feature film was more than deserving of the awards it receives, especially last year's Oscar.Ulrich Mühe totally captivated me by his performance as the Stassi agent trying to please his boss, who was trying to get a promotion by helping a Minister get a lover, the incredibly beautiful and talented Martina Gedeck (The Good Shepard). The fact that government officials would use their office for carnal purposes would not surprise anyone but the most naive, but the pervasiveness of the State into the lives of the East Germans was something that was incredible to believe.The fact that good people are forced into doing something that is opposed to their nature by constant forces was a major theme, but the most important thing shown by Captain Wiesler(Mühe) was that even the most evil can find some good in them and sacrifice themselves for others. It was inspiring and captivating to watch.",10,1,5,29 February 2008
Schindler's List," I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just... I could have got more.
","Winner of seven Oscars. it should have won all of the ones it was nominated for. It won a total of 63 awards. has any film won more? The film stands far above the rest and will do so for all time.It was the detritus that was being picked over after the trains left for the camps that really struck me. The pile of photos were especially hard to take. The memories recorded for lifetimes to be consumed by fire.It was after Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes) arrived, that Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) slowly realized he had something more to do than make money. At least the British film critics and the BAFTA recognized Fiennes performance. It is too bad that Neeson didn't fare as well.Ben Kingsley was also fantastic as Schindler's accountant.A stain on history that will never be forgotten. Impossible to watch with bringing a tear to your eye.",10,9,13,2 May 2009
Across the Universe," I'm a cross-dressing homosexual pacifist with a spot on my lung.
","Love. Love. Love. Love is all you need. This was one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It celebrated love of all types - unrequited love, sibling love, love lost and re-found, gay love, interracial love, parental love, and a love of the music of the Beatles.All this was played out amidst the upheaval in the 60s due to an unpopular war. The children of the 60s were not yet consumed with X-boxes and cell phones, and had the freedom to concentrate their energy towards the greater good.This film has all the elements of a winner. You were consumed with the names of the charters, and when a Beatles song would be woven into the story for these characters. The over 30 songs just fit perfectly with the story.What more could you ask for in a film than outstanding cinematography and sets, over the top choreography, costuming that was amazing, and acting that was superb. Of note, Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy, Jim Sturgess as Jude, Joe Anderson as Max, T.V. Carpio as Prudence, and Dana Fuchs & Martin Luther as the couple Sadie & Jo Jo. Add Bono, Eddie Izzard, and Salma Hayak and you can't miss.Without a doubt, one of the best films of last year.",10,0,3,21 September 2008
The Mist," The day I need a friend like you, I'll just have myself a little squat and sh*t one out.
","What happens when you are trapped with strangers in the face of horror. Do race and class and religious differences come to play and exacerbate the situation? Sure they do, as they did in this film.The monster was real and evil. The horror was definitely something to fear. What could they do? What would happen? When the creatures started coming in the grocery store the real terror began. The creatures get more gruesome and the horror more exciting. It just keeps building and building.Marcia Gay Harden was spectacular as a religious fanatic who stirred the people to commit evil in God's name.I have not seen terror and suspense as displayed in this film. It was true horror.The ending was mind blowing!",8,0,2,12 September 2009
Stardust," An enchanting experience
","I really had no idea what to expect out of this movie. It was billed to me as a 'chick flick,' but with enough eye-candy to keep the guys interested. Boy, were they wrong.The movie is simply enchanting and a deep story about love and all it should mean. Claire Danes has somehow escaped my notice until now, but after her fantastic performance in this film, I am going to be looking for more of her.Michelle Pfeiffer was simply wonderful as the witch and really gave a great performance in every scene.And, Robert De Niro. Just what can I say about his gender-bending performance? He was a real pleasure to watch.The whole movie was hilarious, with jokes just spread throughout. It was just what you want from a fantasy film. You can have your hobbits, I'll take Danes, Pfeiffer, Kate Magowan, and Sienna Miller anytime.",9,1,2,24 May 2008
I Am Legend," God didn't do this. We did!
","OK, I got the short end of the stick here on Mother's Day. My stepdaughter took her mom to Red Lobster and brought me Will Smith. Thanks a lot! As sci-fi goes, this really wasn't a bad movie. It didn't have the character of Vincent Price in The Last Man on Earth - sorry, Will, you just have no depth; but it did have some fantastic sound and visual effects.The hunt for deer through Time Square was a wonder. The sound of the infecteds was intense and thrilling. I would have preferred human infecteds like in 28 Days Later, but I'm a bit of a purist. Why use CGI when humans can do it just as well? It was an enjoyable film, but I still would have preferred going to Red Lobster.",7,1,3,11 May 2008
Dog Day Afternoon," Kiss me. When I'm being f*cked, I like to get kissed a lot.
","Does the media make the news or do they report the news. The media presence has an effect on what is happening. When the media observes an action, it changes. Soon the characters are playing to the media.This is all occurring as Al Pacino is trying to get money for his lover to get an operation. This go wrong from the start and, before they can escape, the police arrive with Charles Durning in the lead.Pacino and During turn it all into a circus that makes it impossible to get anywhere. One girl even has a chance to escape and she goes back in so as not to miss being the center of media attention.Sonny's (Pacino) partner Sal is played by John Cazale, who only made a handful of films, all of them pretty memorable. Most would remember him as Fredo in The Godfather. He died shortly after his last film, The Deer Hunter.We also see the Stockholm Syndrome at work as the girls start getting comfortable with Sonny.His conversations with his wife (Susan Peretz), his lover (Chris Sarandon), and his mom (Judith Malina) all added to the excitement.One of the best movies of the 70s, a tour de force for Pacino, and definitely a movie that stands the test of time.",9,0,0,10 May 2009
Gran Torino," Ever notice how you come across somebody once in a while you shouldn't have messed with? That's me.
","I sat in a full theater with what I suspect was a crowd older than me. You have to have a crowd like that to appreciate what Eastwood was trying to say.The crowd laughed at all the right parts in the movie: the time when Eastwood's character would let out a stream of non-PC comments, and the time when he stood down the punks.Maybe we have become a nation that is too PC and I believe Eastwood was telling us that. The old man had his ghosts and it was eating at him from inside. He couldn't relate to any other world. A man has to do what a man has to do is the saying, I believe. If you can't understand that, than you are not a man, just someone to be pitied or ridiculed.But, there was a soft side of the character that opened the door to a relationship with a young man who really needed a father. The relationship grew so great that Eastwood's character did the most noble thing one man could do for another.Eastwood was magnificent, Ahney Her was a treasure, and Bee Vang was perfect. I really hope to see more of these two in the future.",8,5,11,10 January 2009
Hero," Beautiful Opera
","If you want to see a perfect example of Chinese acting, storytelling and cinematography (Christopher Doyle), as well as one of the best directors in the business, then you can't go wrong with Hero.It won 21 awards (It should have won 23, but the Golden Globes and Academy voters were idiots!) Director Yimou Zhang (House of Flying Dragons, Curse of the Golden Flower) has given us a stunning ballet of China two thousand years ago.The cast includes some of the very best in Chinese movie epics and includes Jet Li (KIss of the Dragon, Romeo Must Die) in his greatest role; Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Infernal Affairs or the real 'Departed'); Ziyi Zhang (Memoirs of a Geisha, TMNT); and Maggie Cheung (2046).Like great opera, this film bears watching over and over.",10,1,3,2 April 2007
The Hurt Locker," What do you mean you can't get it in? Pretend it's your dick.
","Already 67 wins out of 111 nominations. Nine Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. This is the definitive film about action in Iraq.It's not a war picture, it's a soldiers who happen to be at war picture. It focuses on the men who are there doing a dirty job.It was bad enough watching the EOD specialist, SSgt James (Jeremy Renner) disarm one bomb, but then he found a half dozen more. He beats the terrorist, but others are not so lucky as people are just waiting to set the bombs off. When he finds a trunk full of bombs, you know his number has to be up. It's not a job any sane person would do.The excitement, the tension, it's all here! Excitement from beginning to end. A real winner.",9,3,14,24 February 2010
No Man's Land," Now... tell me. Who started the war?
","It is not every day that you take home a boatload of awards for your first feature film, but that is what writer/director Danis Tanovic did, including an Oscar and a Golden Globe for best foreign film.This is just about the best anti-war film I have ever seen. It shows the utter stupidity and foolishness of war in that two soldiers, both who knew the same girl, both who spoke the same language, and both who looked and acted and sounded the same were bitter enemies. I have to think back to the Civil War in America, where I had cousins fighting on both sides to see the utter ignorance that war is all about.Two soldiers, actually three, but he was thought to be dead, end up in a trench in the middle of the Bosnian-Serbian war. The UN Observers get involved, the press is all over it, and the futility of armed aggression is played out in a way that was funny and sad. The ending is a powerful statement on war and should be seen more than once to bring home how we solve nothing when we stop talking and start shooting.",9,4,9,30 March 2008
The Longest Day," Bonjour, mademoiselle. Je suis américain.
","One of the best films of 1962 and one of the best war films ever, The Longest Day features outstanding cinematography, special effects and art work. You really felt that you were present in the time leading up to June 6, 1944, when Allied forces made the incredible landing on the beaches of Normandy.Like me, I am sure many people reading this had family members that were involved (me - a Candian brother-in-law) in this massive undertaking. To see the story from the standpoint of the men involved was a tremendous experience.Yes, I've seen Saving Private Ryan, and the incredible carnage in the first 20 minutes, but I was just as moved by the same footage in this film without the blood. You felt the frustration of the men and the determination to succeed. Their pent-up emotions after an interminable wait to begin were unleashed on the unprepared Germans. The jubilation of the French citizens displayed gave us a real example of a country waiting to be liberated. (Maybe Bush should watch this to see how it really is when people welcome your invasion.) Robert Mitchum led an all-star cast that must have included every major actor in Hollywood at the time. If you can't find a favorite, then you are just not looking hard enough.A superb war film.",8,7,8,28 August 2007
The Illusionist," Everything you have seen here has been an illusion.
","Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti gave what I consider Oscar-worthy performances in this film.I was mesmerized from the beginning with what I consider an outstanding story by writer and director Neil Burger. This was an incredibly beautiful love story made even more spectacular by the use of illusion to achieve happiness.Jessica Biel gave what I consider the performance of her career. It is a shame that she lowered herself to appear in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry this weekend. Hopefully she will give us more performances like this one.With outstanding cinematography by Dick Pope, and a brilliant score by Phillip Glass, with costumes that dazzled, this is one of my favorite films of last year.",8,0,0,21 July 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss.
","With 13 Oscar nominations and three wins, and almost as many BAFTA nominations and wins, there is no doubt that this is one of the best films of last year.First off the makeup and visual effects and sets and cinematography and sound were all superb as one would expect of a film of this caliber.The acting? Well, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, Brad Pitt, Julia Ormond, and Tilda Swinton were all absolutely amazing. Yes, there was a huge cast of supporting characters, both playing the above at different ages, and there were others interacting. They all made this a most enjoyable experience.It was Eric Roth's screenplay and David Fincher's direction that pulled it all together into one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen. The lines in the film were some of the most thought provoking imaginable.What a beautiful love story.",9,1,3,2 June 2009
Transformers," I'll drive, you shoot!
","I have no idea what the kids who watched the transformers TV show were looking for, but they certainly missed an exciting movie while they were bitching about how Michael Bay ruined their kiddy show.This was one hell of a sound and visual experience that showed special effects at their finest.No, there was no acting to speak of, except for Megan Fox, who one hot babe and someone to look for in the future. It was fun, however to see old favorites like John Turturro, Anthony Anderson, and a really funny Bernie Mac.This is one of those movies you just sit back and enjoy.",8,1,6,16 May 2008
Children of Men," Alfonso Cuarón does it again
","Alfonso Cuarón (Alfonso Cuarón) has written and directed another outstanding film with Clive Owen as a burned out activist with the fate of mankind in his hands.Owen, as Theo, comes to the aid of a former partner (Julianne Moore) and is enlisted in the struggle against seemingly incomparable odds to get Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) and her baby to safety.The tension was palpable throughout this film and it never stopped for one second. Seldom have I been on the edge of my seat for an entire film.Michael Caine as an aging stoner was brilliant!",8,4,12,23 April 2007
Million Dollar Baby," The story of life in the trenches
","It is a good thing I did not read Salon.com's review of Million Dollar Baby before I watched it. They derided it by stating that 'Clint Eastwood's boxing movie floats like a lead balloon and stings like a dead bee.' Well, I remember watching a lot of boxing at the National Guard Armory in Tampa 30 years ago, and I can assure you that this was not a 'boxing movie.' The boxing was incidental and only provided the backdrop. This was a story of dreams and failures, of backstabbing and cruelty, of wanting more than life gives you, working for it, and then having some slime ball steal it all when you are not looking because of jealousy. It was about those who take and never give, like the people who grabbed FEMA money in Miami for a hurricane that never came near them. It was the story of life. Real life in the trenches, not life as experienced by those who never worked for anything. It is not about Bush's or Kerry's life, it is about you and me. In that, it succeeded beyond all imagination and I plan to watch it again.",9,7,9,25 September 2005
Garden State," Does New Jersey stink this much?
","There is some risk naming your quirky little film after a State. I actually took some time out last night from the NCAA playoffs (it is the early rounds) to watch a movie that has been in my queue for a while. I don't know how it got in there. It certainly wasn't because of New Jersey native Zack Braff. He is a main character on Scrubs, and this movie certainly validates my choice not to watch that show.Garden State is in the same category as Napoleon Dynamite, another film released in 2004. Did he play in that one, too? There are a lot of people that think these quirky films are cool and that you shouldn't criticize them. Well, I actually made it all the way through Napoleon Dynamite on the second try. What a waste of time! I decided that 20 minutes was all I could give Garden State. When you bill yourself as a comedy, that is plenty of time for a laugh. It didn't happen, and I doubt if it would happen if I stayed the whole way through. I went back to basketball.Maybe it was Natalie Portman that got me to try this film. If so, her appearance on Letterman this week in a clip of her early years as a singer with the World Patrol Kids was a whole lot more interesting. Yes, she is as cute as a button, but not cute enough to sit through Garden State.",2,2,11,17 March 2006
Casualties of War," You couldn't let it rest, could you? You had to push it?
","This is based upon a real incident. This is the real thing that happens when young men are torn from their families and sent far away to fight and die.William Tecumseh Sherman said 'War is Hell,' but they really don't care back home when it is all over. The casualties that return alive are never counted, and of little concern to a nation that is back to making money.This is the story of one group of casualties. They were so damaged that they did the unthinkable. Sean Penn gave the performance of a lifetime as Sgt. Meserve.Michael J. Fox was outstanding as the one who couldn't live with what happened.Also featuring John C. Reilly in his first film role, and John Leguizamo in his second.This great film by Brian De Palma reminds us that all casualties don't arrive home in body bags.",8,4,7,29 June 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Why do female names always bring you to porn sites?
","Fans of Pauley Perrette's role as Abby on NCIS, will love the character Lisbeth Salander, a goth girl played by Noomi Rapace. She turns a great thriller into something much more interesting.Lisbeth is supposed to be the best hacker in Sweden, and Mikael Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist), who has a short time before he enters prison for libel, finds her to help look for the lost niece of a billionaire (Sven-Bertil Taube).The film is brutal is some respects, as Lisbeth is abused by the man who controls her money. She is forced to have sex with him before she can collect. However she manages to turn the tables, and it is delicious.When they discover the secret, it is even more heinous than they imagined.But, things go on from there, and I would not reveal the surprising ending. It was sweet.Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist were perfect. Unfortunately, Hollywood will remake the film with some losers. It is too good a story for them to resist.",9,3,7,9 July 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Super film - definitely Strathairn is the man to beat come Oscar time
","I was only three when the events of the movie took place. I was enjoying my youth before starting my journey of 13 years of Catholic education with kindergarten looming on the horizon. Obviously, I wasn't aware of the Red Scare that Tailgunner Joe used to his advantage before he was brought down by Morrow and others.Now, don't go to this movie expecting historical accuracy. Morrow himself admits that he was late in the game and there were many others that went after Joe McCarthy before he did. That is not important, as this is the story of a small group that set out to change the world and, as Margaret Mead said, that's the only way things get changed.You can bone up on your McCarthy and Morrow history, or you can simply go to enjoy the movie. Good Night and Good Luck stands on its own as entertainment, and it is definitely the best film I have seen this year (Crash is number 2).David Strathairn as Edward R. Morrow gives a performance that will be hard to top as qualifications for the Oscars hits full throttle. I have to admit that I hadn't seen him since L.A. Confidential. I'm going to have to catch up on some of the other movies he has done. I guess I could look for him when Heaven's Fall comes out - he plays the Judge in the trial of the 'Scottsboro Boys.' I am certainly going to stop by the video store to see if the have a copy of Twisted. I don't know how I missed that as I love Ashley Judd and Samuel L. Jackson. It should be great.It is interesting to watch history and the Red Scare and the right-wing Senator who used it to his advantage. It is interesting because that same right-wing and their Red States are using the same tactics today. The blow-hards of the right - Hannity, Coulter, Limbaugh, and O'Reilly, among others - are branding anyone who doesn't agree with the government as traitors, just as they were branded communists in the 50s. Fortunately, they can't get away with it today as the blogoshphere keeps them honest - but they don't keep trying! One last and funny thing about the movie. Man, do they smoke! It seems that everyone had a cig going at all times. I haven't seen so much smoking in the movies since JFK.Like the name of Morrow's show, you have to See It Now.",10,2,3,20 November 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," My name is Alice and I remember everything.
","I am going out on a limb here and rating the sequel better than the original. I do that because it had way more zombie action and a lot less sci-fi. Sorry, gamers, but I want a movie, not a game.Alexander Witt had scads of experience as a second unit director and cameraman, and did a decent job in his directorial debut. Unfortunately, he was up against some real zombie action, now (Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Land of the Dead), so the film fell short for some. Their loss! Milla Jovovich was back and juiced up with the virus and evolved into a kick-ass beauty that would give Jet Li a run for his money. She is accompanied by Sienna Guillory from Love Actually, Helen of Troy, and the Principle of Lust, and that gives us a duo of beautiful action babes.Say what you will, but Nemesis was as bad as I've seen since Robocop, and damn ugly to boot. I haven't seen such rabid dogs since Rottweiller; they were awesome! Like I say, this film had a lot more zombie action and a fitting end to the jerk in charge.",7,1,3,21 September 2007
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," We're not supposed to be friends, you and me. We're meant to be enemies. Did you know that?
","One of the difficult things about life in the military is the fact that a promotion, especially at the higher levels, is usually accompanied by a transfer. This can be very hard on children, as they are constantly giving up their friends.Bruno's (Asa Butterfield) father (David Thewlis) is a Nazi Officer and he is promoted and sent to run a camp. Bruno has to give up his friends in Berlin and make the best of it on a 'farm' that is really not a farm.We are well into the film before Bruno meets Smuel (Jack Scanlon), the boy in the title. He is naive about his situation, He is only eight, as is Smuel. Their relationship develops to a point where it is clear that both are benefiting, and both will be truly disappointed.A conflict arises between the parents, Thewlis and Vera Farmiga, when she finds out what they are doing at the camp. Not just a conflict, but a real rift in their relationship.The ending will kick you in the gut.",9,3,5,15 August 2009
The Evil Dead," You bastards, why are you torturing me like this? Why?
","This award winning video nasty that was initially banned and re-released uncut in 2001 is one of the 74 films banned in Britain.One can only imagine what will happen in a remote cabin in the woods.Something akin to getting off the main roads in Texas.It doesn't take long for the spookiness to start, and smart people would be running immediately.No, don't touch that stuff in the basement! Ellen Sandweiss is the first to come into contact with the evil creature and gave us good breast in the process. Boy can she scream! Then things really get interesting!It's creepy and the makeup and special effects are great. There is blood aplenty.This was one heck of a horror film and Bruce Campbell was fantastic.",8,6,10,14 August 2008
Saw II," Those who do not appreciate life do not deserve life.
","Amanda: What is the cure for Cancer, Eric? The cure for death itself. The answer is immortality. By creating a legacy, by living a life worth remembering, you become immortal. So now we find the tables are turned. It is I who will carry on John's work after he dies, and you are my first test subject. Now you are locked away, helpless and alone.I really expected a lot of gore, but, instead, I was exposed to a devious mind that designed a clever way to punish. The person most in need of punishment gets his, but others along the way got theirs, too.There wasn't much real gore, but their were some good performances that made this film worthwhile for anyone who like horror. I haven't seen the first one yet, but I am certainly going to put it in my queue along with Saw III. I will be at the theater for Saw IV.Kudos to Donnie Wahlberg, Shawnee Smith, Tobin Bell and Dina Meyer. Also to Darren Lynn Bousman, who will also be directed Saw III and will be directing Saw IV.",8,0,1,29 July 2007

I mean what more could you want in a film: Directed by : Robert Rodriguez Screenplay by: Quentin Tarantino Starring: George Clooney AND Quentin Tarantino AND Harvey Keitel AND Juliette Lewis AND Salma Hayek AND Danny Trejo! What starts as a wild caper film turns into the most outrageous example of vampire fun that you could imagine.You get to see special effects that are totally awesome, you get to see gore, and you get to see Salma Hayak in the most beautiful strip dance ever - and she doesn't even take it all off!

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Little girl? Don't touch that squirrel's nuts! It'll make him crazy!
","I never cease to be amazed by the versatility of Johnny Depp. Whether he is a pirate or writing Peter Pan or an adventurer or a criminal, he never fails to entertain. There is nothing he hasn't done in his 45 films, or will not have done in the five films currently in production or the 15 films in pre-production. Even as the creepy Willy Wonka (Think Michael Jackson for comparison.), he was magnificent. Maybe we have to blame his father (Christopher Lee) for some of that creepiness. After all, depriving your child of Halloween candy is just mean.But, the real star of this film was Charlie (Freddie Highmore), who was the only sane child that arrived at the factory. He was surrounded by four of the most obnoxious children (and their obnoxious parents) that I have ever seen. They got what they deserved.The color, imagination, costumes, and sets were magnificent. It was such a pleasure to watch.Depp comes through again. I am not surprised.",8,6,9,11 August 2009

Two men (Nicolas Cage & Michael Peña) buried in the rubble, and two wives waiting (Maria Bello & Maggie Gyllenhaal) made for one hell of a story about fear and courage and what is important.Add one man who knew he had to do something and found the two cops. This is a story I will not soon forget.I have to say that I honestly only watched it to see Maria Bello, whom I love, but I was really touched by the story and the acting of those I mentioned. They, especially Michael Peña did an outstanding job.Oliver Stone is to be commended for his work on this film.",10,1,4,13 May 2007
Black Snake Moan," I aim to cure you of your wicked ways.
","After Hustle & Flow, I just knew that Craig Brewer would present another great musical moment and a story of redemption and renewal. Although this film does not live up to his earlier success, it is, nonetheless, a film worth watching and has a strong message of hope.The draw is not only Craig Brewer, but the outstanding acting of Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci. A great supporting cast, including John Cothran Jr. and S. Epatha Merkerson, made this film more than enjoyable.The only thing that kept this movie from being more, was that it gave less than it should. The idea was great, but there really never was any effort made by Laz to help Rae except chain her up. He left all the hard work to the Reverend R. L., and gave up before she could really be called changed.The psychological effects of child sexual abuse are severe, and the denial by Rae's mother is all too common, but they really stretched it to have some pain traveling down from her head to her uterus, with the only cure a hard f*ck. That detracted from the real trauma experienced by Rae that drove her behavior. You see how she changed in just one week by foregoing alcohol and drugs. That message should have been stronger.But, I am not here to bury the Snake, but to praise it for the great music, the fine acting, and a story that really was worth telling, even if it had some weaknesses.",7,1,4,23 April 2008
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Luther is silent for a moment, as he stares at my little bishop in a turtleneck.
","A rock musical in the style of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, this film is about a German boy that falls in love with an American and wants to go to America with him. We see it all in flashback as she is touring the U.S.Of course, he can't without getting a sex-change operation. Hansel becomes Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell) in a botched operation that leaves a little too much behind, and soon finds herself abandoned in a Kansas trailer park. She turns tricks at a nearby military base, becomes a baby-sitter for the general, and meets the general's son, Tommy Gnossis (Michael Pitt). They're lovers, until Tommy discovers the secret of Hedwig's transsexualism and abandons her.John Cameron Mitchell gives a great Glam-Rock performance in a loud and flashy movie that has a lot underneath. Great soundtrack.",8,0,2,27 November 2009
The Insider," The Big Lie
","Jeffrey Wigand (Russel Crowe) put it all on the line: his family, he reputation, his career, and his life. He had a story to tell about the addictive properties of tobacco and it was eating at him until he got it out. Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) of CBS News went to bat and did everything in his power to get his story out. He ended up walking away from his job also in the effort. The story made it out and Big Tobacco paid billions in the familiar tobacco settlements. This is the story of the man who brought them down.The acting was brilliant and the directing was masterful. Crowe, director Michael Mann and The Insider were all beat out in the 2000 Academy Awards by American Beauty. What a shame as this was clearly the superior film.",9,3,4,3 March 2007

","There was a lousy football game on so I thought I would wait for a better one and watch this film again. I am glad i did as the game ended 40-10.The cast of this film is what makes it. They put together a great group to do a movie that is nothing special - losers and has-beens win the pennant.I like Charlie Sheen and he is worth watching in anything he does, especially 'Two and a Half Men.' He was perfect in the character of the renegade.I just saw Corbin Bernsen recently in The Dentist, and he can bring laughs to any movie.Rene Russo? I love her and even though her part was small, it was great.Wesley Snipes, Tom Berenger, and Dennis Haysbert all had a unique way of making this a great movie. And, hooray for Stacy Carroll in her only movie. How did they let her get away? I want to thank the Japanese Academy for recognizing this film with a nomination for best Foreign Film. They recognize greatness when they see it.",8,4,7,22 November 2008
The Dark Knight," The world is cruel, and the only morality in a cruel world is chance.
","If a film deserves to be called the best of the years based upon entertainment value, then this one will win hands down. I cannot imagine any other film standing close to this film is pure excitement, adrenaline rush, and beauty with fantastic effects, and sound.The lighting could have been a tad better, but that is such a minor flaw that it hardly seems worth mentioning.Christian Bale IS Batman, now and forever. There will never be anyone that can top his performance.Heath Ledger is, without any doubt whatsoever, deserving of recognition for his performance. He was absolutely incredible in a part that required supreme skills. It was a part that 99% of the actors in the world could not begin to play.Worthy of mention is also Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman in their roles. Hooray for Morgan's writer for reminding us of the ever present evil we have lived under for eight years.Hands down the best entertainment of the year. Now, pardon me while I go watch it again.",9,3,10,25 December 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Read it, roll it, hole it.
","This is not a movie that I would typically watch at 2:30 in the morning, but I got into it and couldn't stop until it was over.Shia LaBeouf demonstrated that he is not just a young actor here, but could handle more demanding roles. The fact that he has been handed those roles in the last two years is testament to his ability.It was really his movie. Sure, there were others involved, but they pale in comparison to his role.This was a time when gold was reserved for the privileged. This victory opened it up to the masses, much the way that Tiger Woods has opened golf to all races.Like Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) said to Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth): ' ...if Mr. Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) wins tomorrow, it's because he's the best, because of who he is. Not who his father was, not how much money he's got, because of who he bloody is! And I'll thank you to remember that.' Go get charged up.",7,1,1,8 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Potter... You will lose... everything.
","I actually got the opportunity to see this today and was mesmerized by the increasing maturity of the movies in the series. It actually was more of an adult film that the previous ones and makes me think that we are in for a treat with the next two.The usual gang is back, and there are some great performances. I particularly liked Richard Griffiths (Vernon Dursley) in his brief appearance; Natalia Tena (Mrs. Henderson Present, About a Boy) was the first really attractive adult in the films; Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) was also excellent; Alan Rickman (Snape) is a favorite; and, of course, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Valdamort.I really liked the performance of Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. I am looking forward to seeing her again. And the addition of unknown Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood was brilliant casting.The ending fights were spectacular and worth the price of admission. This was definitely the best yet and makes me anxious for number six.",6,1,6,12 July 2007
Into the Wild," No phone, no pool, no pets. No cigarettes.
","I can only imagine that there are many others, like myself and Chris, who want to be free of those 'irksome obligations,' and just take off. Unfortunately, most, like myself, will never do it. The story of Chris is a vicarious thrill for me.I was anxious to see him head to 'slab city,' ever since I saw Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea. It has been one of those places I wanted to explore. But, that had to wait as he headed for South Dakota. It didn't matter where he went, there were outstanding scenes to experience and great people along the way.I have to say that Vince Vaughn really impressed me in this film. This is not the Vince Vaughn that I do not like.Rather than wait 12 years for a permit, he just took off down the river. If he hadn't he wouldn't have met Sonja and Rads.Finally, Salton Sea, and Rainey and Jan (Catherine Keener) again; and Tracey (Kristen Stewart). He was a gentleman and saved her for the vampire to come.A stop on the way to gain wisdom from the great Hal Holbrook, and it's time to go. 'But when you forgive, you love. And when you love, God's light shines through you,' Knowing people like his parents and the fact that similar things have happened due to their actions regarding their children, makes this story all the more personal. It is one that anyone can gain by seeing over and over.A magnificent story, great scenery, fascinating people, and a grisly ending.Emile Hirsch was amazing.",9,3,6,23 January 2009
"Girl, Interrupted"," What if you don't have a secret?
","Seeing this film reminds me of everything that is wrong with adults. They confuse spontaneity and originality and discovering yourself with mental illness. Act out a little in school, and it's ADHD. Act out at home, and it's bring on the Prozac.Winona Ryder was incredible as the teen who was really just being a rebellious teen, and got caught up in a system that won't let loose until you admit you are crazy, even if you aren't. She is joined by the best performance I have ever seen by Whoopi Goldberg.As good as these two were, it was Angelina that shined in this film. Jolie was absolutely incredible as the one who was really off the deep end. She was in so much pain, that she loved causing it to others. A super performance by a super actress.",8,2,2,26 May 2008
Green Street Hooligans," I'd smash seven shades of shite out of him.
","I don't know much about British hooligans, but Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, 'CSI: New York') and Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings) made it worth my time. And, it is well worth the time as these two are fantastic.After Wood gets kicked out of Harvard, he learns about some real kicks - football!It should have had subtitles for those of us who don't speak English. :-). But, the mix of football and firms (gangs) was fascinating. Charlie Hunnam was great as the firm's leader, who took Woods under his wing.Things get tense when Wood's dad visits and he gets seen at the Times. A secret is revealed and the excitement level skyrockets. Boy, do they all hate journalists!The song 'One Blood', sung by Terence Jay highlighted a marvelous sound track.",8,2,2,14 February 2009
Blood Diamond," God left this place a long time ago.
","I have not been a Leonardo DiCaprio fan. I do like Djimon Hounsou and have seen several of his films. Watching this film, I have to say that both deserve every single award they received and should have probably gotten every award they were nominated for. I only hesitate to state this unequivocally because I have not seen The Last King of Scotland yet.This story needed to be told and I cannot imagine anyone telling it better that DiCaprio and Hounsou in the extremely capable hands of Edward Zwick, working with an outstanding script by Charles Leavitt.The story was tender, exciting, awesome, and, at times, just plain disgusting. The fact that there are countries that brainwash children and turn them against their parents and make killers out of them is inexcusable. The fact that these people are operating today is a blot of shame on all so-called civilized nations, including my own.This is our homeland. All humans came from this soil. What we allow to happen there in the name of beauty is disgusting.I cannot imagine anyone not owning this movie so as to watch it many times and remind ourselves that if we are not part of the solution to this problem, we share some of the blame for it.",9,2,2,17 August 2007
The Graduate," Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.
","If you want to take a trip back in time and look at societies in the swinging sixties, then this is the vehicle for you.This is the film that made Dustin Hoffman a star.Who could have concocted a story about a confused young man having an affair with his girlfriend's mother? Besides Hofmann, we have superior performances by mother (Anne Bancroft) and daughter (Katherine Ross).Mike Nichols got an Oscar nomination for directing his first film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. This was his second film and he won an Oscar. Is this guy good, or what?Another 1967 film that pushes the envelope.",9,2,3,22 May 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders.
","I avoided this movie because I thought I would never see anything starring Jim Carrey (Dumb & Dumber, The Cable Guy, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls) that was worth watching. That was my loss.Kate Winslet(Little Children) was absolutely brilliant in this film by Oscar-winner Charlie Kaufman. And, of course, one of my very favorites, Kirsten Dunst, also gave a great performance.I have to admit that I have a new appreciation for Carrey after seeing this film. He was perfect for the role and pulled it off spotlessly.No matter how bad it is, there is always something special about that relationship. So, just remember the good times.",9,2,6,29 December 2007
Once Upon a Time in America," Happy Birthday Max
","When I think of James Woods, I have to go back to this classic by Sergio Leone, who directed those great Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. He also did this film and Once Upon a Time in the West.This is an outstanding gangster film with Woods and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. There are several versions, and the director's cut is the best for the intended non-linear style. The studio released the movie in chronological order, but that is not what Leone intended.The score is an integral part of this film that sets the mood and acts without dialog in many instances.This is not a movie for those wimps that did not go to Grindhouse. It is 229 minutes in the preferred version, which is over a half an hour longer.",9,0,3,18 April 2007
Taken," Now's not the time for dick measuring, Stuart!
","On thing that is a sure as the sun coming up tomorrow is that a film written by Luc Besson will be thrilling. There's Taxi 1-4, Transporter 1-3, Leon, the Professional, and many more. This is just another one of Besson's magical films that will thrill you from start to finish.Darkman himself, Liam Neeson, is magnificent as a father that will do anything for his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). When she is taken for the sex trade, he springs into action that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end.I have seen some very good films about the sex trade. Mira Sorvino in Human Trafficking, and Kevin Kline in Trade; but, Neeson is at the top of the game in tracking though the muck of this business to get to the top. We see all levels of the business on the way, and we glimpse the dregs of humanity in the process.Realistic car chases, plenty of scum left on the floor, and some very satisfying justice makes this the most incredible 93 minutes you can experience.",8,3,6,7 March 2009
The Mummy Returns," Rachel Weisz is fantastic
","I got a chance to see Rachel Weisz in a dark movie last night, but she really shines in this film. I continue to be impressed by her range. It's not a great film by any measure, but it is good fun. Weisz's duel with Patricia Velasquez as the reincarnated Anck-su-Namun was incredible.This is, in one sense, a family movie, al la 'True Lies.' Dad (Brendon Frazier), mom (Weisz) and son (Freddie Boath) all fight together to defeat Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo). There is even a kooky brother-in-law (John Hannah) - a real family adventure.This is the second film for 'The Rock.' He was in 'Longshot,' but way down on the billing as a mugger. Here he rises to prominence in a cast, but his character is quite ridiculous. It's something out of a 'B' movie.All in all, if you are looking for some mindless entertainment on a Saturday night, this film can frequently be found on USA. Check it out if, for no other reason, another chance to see the incredibly sexy Rachel Weisz.",7,0,1,2 May 2007
Avatar," I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up.
","'I was saved! I was saved by a flying wild man in a loincloth.' No, that is not Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) talking about Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), but Jane speaking about Tarzan, the original 'white savior.' Avatar is just another version of the 'white savior' movie - the natives are incapable of protecting themselves, so a white savior learns their language and customs and protects them from the invaders; in this case the military-industrial complex of a certain country that invades others (like Iraq) so they can get their resources (unobtainium or oil).The one thing James Cameron did was pack his film with lots of good and great actors (Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang), and amazing special effects. No matter what the story, it is definitely worth watching.Now, that is not to say it is perfect by any means. The Pocahontas story was really tiresome, and designed to appeal to the teens. The fan boys were captured by the bare breasted natives. Why is it that only natives can go bare breasted? Personally, Michelle Rodriguez in a t shirt was way hotter than the natives.Needless to say the military and their Star Wars weapons of war are no match for Mother Nature.",8,4,8,21 August 2010
Chariots of Fire," If you don't run, you can't win.
","It was interesting as I watched this for the 3rd or 4th time that I never noticed that Dodie Fayed was the executive producer. Nothing special except that we are remembering his death 10 years ago with Princess Diana.This film is also about being an Englishman and what that means. Like Fayed, Abrahams (Ben Cross) was an outsider, and that didn't always sit well with the power structure. But he played the game his way and won.Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) also played the game his way and won the race and the respect of his countrymen.Honor in the pursuit of excellence. A great story that never fades in the retelling.",8,2,2,19 August 2007
Victory," Where do I stand for a corner kick?
","John Huston, Oscar winning director of The Treasure of Sierra Madre, gives us an entertaining film about a football match between The Germand and Allied POWs during WWII.Until the actual game, this was just a routine POW movie with the usual obnoxious British Officers, and the one that thinks outside the box (Michael Caine) and makes it interesting.The actual football match was held in Paris and the Germans fielded their National Team (actors) against a collection of real players from Belgium, England, Poland, Holland, Scotland, Argentina, Ireland, and the great Pele from Brazil. The field judges were, of course, bought off by the Germans.An escape was planned for halftime, but the game continued and escape occurred later. Like I said, except for the football, this was a routine POW film.Sly Stallone played an American in the camp that met with the French Resistance to set up the escape. He was actually rather good.",7,2,2,8 June 2007
Drag Me to Hell," You'd be surprised what you'll do, when the Lamia comes for you.
","I gave it a fair look, but the fact that it was nominated for a Teen Choice Award told me that I would have to be prepared for disappointment. How anyone would make a horror movie with a PG-13 rating is beyond comprehension. They must have good reasons, and I am anxious to see what they may be. I watched the unrated director's cut, but I have always found that to be a scam.The Pork Queen (Alison Lohman) should know better that try and tackle old crones (Lorna Raver). They tend to get cranky and hate losing. Some garbage about shame. It must be a gypsy thing.There are a lot of spooky noises and plenty of disgusting goop that teens love, but there is nothing that would give lovers of Raimi's earlier films any worry. This is strictly for the Twilight fan and not for serious lovers of horror.",6,0,5,23 October 2009
Grindhouse," Judge it in it's class
","You can't look at Grindhouse up against Volver or Children of Men. You have to judge it in the same weight class. There you will see a champion. It's a loud, bloody, long homage to the cars, corpses and copulation Z-pictures of the 1970s that captures reverence for the medium that was evident in the original 'grindhouse' movies, films catering to an unsophisticated audience in an era when mass movie-going was in danger of fading away.It has roots in films such as Rolling Thunder (1977), Dawn of the Dead (1979), Zombi 2 (1979), Rock All Night (1957), and Escape From New York (1981). Robert Rodriguez's gives us a knock-off of Night of the Living Dead with Planet Terror, and Quentin Tarantino champions tough-talking chicks and Dodge Challengers in Death Proof. The former is a much more interesting film, but the latter was excellent, too. The previews of coming attractions added immensely to the film. At least we didn't have to watch previews that were 'suitable for all ages.' Why would previews at an 'R' rated movie not be 'R' rated also? Zoe Bell, Kurt Russell, and Rose McGowan are among a cavalcade of stars that include Nickolas cage and Bruce Willis.You go to Grindhouse for the same reasons people went to the original grindhouses visceral action and visceral sex. You don't go for the acting or an 'Oscar' experience.",8,2,7,11 April 2007
Invictus," The Rainbow Nation starts here. Reconciliation starts here.
","Directed by Clint Eastwood, and starring the incomparable Morgan Freeman, with outstanding support from Mat Damon, this is the tale of you unite a country.Mandela (Freeman) was not focused on the past. he wanted to create a new nation. A nation united. Sports is one way to go about it. He felt that the country could unite behind a winning sports team, in this case Rugby.Sport will not solve all the country's problems, but it can unite the people to work together and forget the past. Mandela knew this.An inspirational film by Eastwood that is one of the best sports films ever.",8,1,2,3 November 2010
Saw," This is the most fun I've had without lubricant!
","James Wan and Leigh Whannell have certainly come up with something unusual. I am sure most readers are familiar with the film. I am a little late getting her, but I am sure glad I made it.Wan directed and wrote the film, while Whannell wrote and starred in it. This was certainly something out of the minds of unusual people.The twists and turns really keep me interested, and the whole point made you think: Most people are so ungrateful to be alive, but not you, not any more...I never expected to see Danny Glover. It's been a long time.Unusual and great movie.",8,0,3,9 September 2007
Up," Adventure is out there!
","I generally stay away from animation as I am interesting in acting not cartoons. However, this is nominated for a Golden Globe, and will likely get an Oscar nomination, so I am forced to watch it.The color is fantastic. They are rich and varied, and I could really enjoy it just for that.What is really cool about this film is the fact that it is about two elderly men, Carl (Edward Asner) and Charles (Christopher Plummer), and a little boy, Russell (Jordan Nagai), who is not a know-it-all kid. And, of course, a dog (Bob Peterson) that talks.The escape from the dogs was as exciting as anything I've seen from Indiana Jones. My mouth was agape the entire time! There is s much story here that it is worth watching again and again.",9,0,1,17 January 2010
A Clockwork Orange," The insincerity was clear to be seen. He ceases to be a wrongdoer. He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice.
","Oscar nominated, BAFTA nominates, nominated, but no wins. They wanted to recognize the beauty of this film (and it was artistically fantastic), but could not bring themselves to give it award.I have to go against the grain here, as I see this as a political statement, not a film about violence.It is Kubrick's vision to solve crime and clear out the prisons. Aversion therapy may work to do both, but is that really a solution? Why waste the fortnight? Just give them a frontal lobotomy and be done with it.The American solution is just the opposite. No less right-wing, the largest prison system in the World serves two purposes: legalized slavery and disenfranchisement of minorities. We make billions off prison labor and we can reduce those who would vote for the wrong party.All of this is just Orwell's 1984 in a different form. Control the masses through drugs, aversion therapy, or locking them up forever.Nothing to be proud about, and nothing that makes this any kind of classic.",7,1,4,12 August 2008
From Hell," How long have you been chasing the dragon, Inspector?
","There is no shortage of theories on Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders in 188. This is another and takes it's place in the annals of a crime that will likely never be solved.Johnny Depp is magnificent as a drug-addicted Inspector Frederick Abberline, who is charged with solving the murders. But isn't Depp always magnificent? Of course, the powers that be do not want him to solve the murders as it is one of their ownThis is a dark film, as any on the subject of the Ripper should be, but it has a fine collection of actors making it enjoyable. Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesias wrote a great screenplay, and direction by the Hughes brothers, Albert and Allen, is spot on.",7,0,1,9 May 2010
Invincible," People don't want heart Dick, they want wins.
","You've seen it in Rocky, Rudy, and probably many other films. Little guy gets a chance and shines in the big game.This is based on a real character who walked on to the field and played pro ball for three years. It's a great story and made even more so by the fact that his friends were really suffering at the time with a strike and needed the boost that came from his performance.Mark Wahlburg (Four Brothers, The Planet of the Apes) was spot on as Vince Papale, the bartender who became a pro football player. Greg Kinnear (The Matador, Little Miss Sunshine) was convincing as coach Dick Vermeil. Elizabeth Banks from the Spiderman trilogy was just plain hot as the girlfriend.This is one of the greats for sports films.",8,0,1,10 June 2007
Groundhog Day," You're not a god. You can take my word for it; this is twelve years of Catholic school talking.
","Innovation: something new or different. An apt word to describe the film written by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis, based upon a story by Danny Rubin. With so many films just copying each other, sometimes with very little change other than the actors - witness the ripoffs of great foreign films made by Hollywood with sub-par actors - it is refreshing to see something different.Starring Bill Murray in what is probably his best role, Lost in Translation notwithstanding, it also feature a fantastic performance by Andie MacDowell, who grabbed my heart in Four Weddings and a Funeral.This is a film that will keep you laughing and holds up well despite the fact that I have seen it ten times at least.",9,1,4,12 September 2010
Reservoir Dogs," Hardened criminals on parade
","Mr. Pink: You kill anybody? Mr. White: A few cops. Mr. Pink: No real people? Mr. White: Just cops. This is probably the most succinct characterization of this movie. We are talking hardened criminals here that have no regard for cops. Killing them is a sport. This movie shows the criminal mind better than any other I have seen. It is raw and hard and bloody and violent. It is not full of shootout and special effects. It is pure and clean and focused on conversation that gives some insight into what a criminal goes through. The anxiety after a botched job becomes paranoia and suspicion. Yes, it is justified, but here you see it to the extreme.Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi were a joy to watch even though I would have shot Mr. Pink at the first opportunity just to shut him up!",8,2,3,7 April 2007
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Is this how our revolution started?
","I cannot watch this film without thinking that this must be the way the American revolution against the British started. If one just believes a small part of this portrayal of the British to be true, then there is ample justification for all revolutions against them. The soldiers in this film would make great customers for Hostel.Ken Loach tells a great story here about a ragtag band of freedom fighters that go up against the British occupiers.Cillian Murphy (Red Eye, 28 Days Later...) is excellent as a doctor that joins the IRA after seeing abuse after abuse by the British. Padraic Delaney as Teddy and Orla Fitzgerald as Sinead added immensely to the film.Of course, the freedom fighters are sold out by their friends, the church and the landowners, and it is many more generations before Ireland can taste freedom.Barry Ackroyd's cinematography in County Cork was stupendous, as was the fantastic soundtrack.",8,1,10,17 January 2008
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Kill me! At least God, whom I implore, will pity me. Kill me, but don't dishonor me.
","One has to expect depravity from a film based on the works of the Marquis de Sade, but this film reached depths of depravity heretofore unseen by me.This is not pornographic. It is sadistic to a degree that one would seldom experience. It is a horror film with continual nudity. Jaded Fascists in Norther Italy kidnap 18 young men and women and force them to engage in acts that one would not think humans could imagine.There was one part of this film that fast forwarding was not enough for me; I just had to go to the next chapter.They even had an ass-judging contest that reminded me of the photos of Abu Ghraib.Sadistic humiliation is not enough, and physical torture begins. Torture that even exceeds that seen in Hostel. One can imagine the final act of depravity.",6,0,2,8 February 2009
The Red Violin," What do you do when the thing you most wanted, so perfect, just comes?
","A fascinating film that traces the history of a violin across 300 years from it's maker to some monks to a British aristocrat who likes to play the violin while he is having sex and a Chinese woman who risks her life to protect a violin from the martinets of the Cultural Revolution.In the process the violin is buried, shot at, and burned before it's secrets can be discovered by Samuel L. Jackson. He desires this instrument and we have to wonder whether or not he ends up with it.It is a remarkable story of perfection and greed amidst the hunger of the world. Is the beauty of a perfect violin worth more that the mouths it can feed?",6,1,3,16 August 2007
Departures," Everyone dies. I will die, and so will you. Death is normal.
","I have been waiting on the chance to see this Oscar winner by Yôjirô Takita. Having seen the magnificent films it beat, I knew it had to be good.Not doing well as a cellist, Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) applies for a job at what he thinks is a travel agency. He is going to be preparing the 'departed' for cremating, not preparing travelers for departures.He even hides his job from his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue). It's no wonder, as a friend advises him to get a 'proper job.' Then, his wife finds out what he does, and she leaves him.But thing turn around when the lady who runs the baths dies. His wife and 'friend' see what he does, and if you don't fight back the tears, you are one cold dude.Sometimes funny, but always respectful, the film really grabs you. The music is fantastic, and the scenery when he is away from work playing his cello is breathtaking.Combined with Wandafuru raifu (After Life) and Ikiru, we gain a great appreciation of the Japanese attitude towards death.This was fantastic!",9,2,4,14 February 2010
Pretty Woman," We both screw people for money.
","Julia Roberts got a Golden Globe along with an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a prostitute in an updated version of My Fair Lady.As ridiculous as the story is, one has to admit that it was just plain funny.No prostitutes I have ever seen on the news that actually work the streets look like Julia Roberts; not even like her pal Laura San Giacomo - most are just ugly. It is not a pretty business and I think it a flaw of the film to glamorize it.But, it was so funny! Yes, seeing Julia in a position that was uncomfortable was funny, but why couldn't she have just been a flower seller? Maybe the speech-writer for a current presidential candidate wrote this script. I can see Vivian and Kit yelling, 'Yes, We Can!' Come on, it was funny! OK, Julia's slapstick was a little over the top, but Hector Elizondo was amazing funny as the Manager and doesn't get enough credit for his understated performance.It was funny and that makes it worth revisiting.",7,0,1,14 February 2008
The Descent," Hey, there's something down here...
","If there was ever the remotest chance that I would ever go into a cave, that chance just became non existent after seeing this film.Girls may want to have fun, but these girls - Shauna Macdonald, Natalie Jackson Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, MyAnna Buring (Grindhouse), and Nora-Jane No one - are starkers! I'm all for a little adventure, but this was more than my heart can take. Hell, it was almost too much just watching it.If you want to get scared shitless, then you have to see this film.Makeup was incredible and there were some great performance in an adrenaline-pumping exercise in terror.",8,1,3,26 January 2008
Some Like It Hot," Story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
","Considered by many to be the best comedy of all time. It sits atop the American Film Institutes's list of Top 100 comedies. It one an Oscar for costume design, and was nominated for five others; Jack Lemmon got a BAFTA award, and director Billy Wilder got a nomination; it won three Golden Globes: Best Picture, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe. With all that, you expect to be thoroughly entertained for the whole two hours.You can just imagine the hilarity as Lemmon and Tony Curtis don dresses and join an all-girl band to escape the mob. Add Marilyn in the mix and the laughs just keep coming.This is definitely one not to miss.",8,1,1,14 November 2009
Inside Man," C'mon! You've seen Dog Day Afternoon! You're stalling!
","This is a great caper film. You are kept guessing throughout the entirety of this movie. You find the actions of the bank robbers to be very cleaver - dressing everyone alike so the police will not be able to distinguish thief from hostage - but, there are enough misdirections that you never really know what is going on. Did it fail or not? Will they get away? Is it the perfect crime? You just have to tune in to find out. Brilliant.Spike Lee gave us a great film that is a departure from his usual fare. Denzel Washington and Clive Owen were absolutely on target with their performances. It is all low key and methodical. Youare kept interested every step of the way.The only criticism I have of the film is the waste of a fine actress like Jodie Foster. She could have been written out of the film and not be missed. That is a shame.",6,2,4,18 May 2007
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," It's all been replaced by a pile of corpses.
","Guy Ritchie will have a hard time coming up with a film that matches this one for humor and just plain entertainment.The fact that everything works for these four lads (Tom, Soap, Eddie & Bacon), while everything is falling apart is just hilarious.Nick Moran (The Musketeer), Jason Flyming (The Transporter 2), Dexter Flethcher (Tristan & Isolde< Doom, Lionheart, and my fav, Jason Statham (Transporter, Transporter 2, The One, London, The Pink Panther) all keep you in stitches as the stumble through this film.

The Da Vinci Code," Did that old cannabis charge finally catch up with me?
","Do you love a good mystery/thriller? How about one that is supposedly based on fact? How about one that takes place in Paris and the UK? If you do, then this film has every thing you could be looking for in a movie.Ron Howard and Tom Hanks had an impossible job. Making a credible film on the tail of a hugely successful book. They managed to make a film that was interesting and exciting, and it had a great score, and superb sound and visual effects.Yes, I read the book, and I even knew about the Templars and Opus Dei before I read the book. I also read the book that The DaVinci Code was based upon. I knew the premises and that did not spoil the book for me, just as reading the book did not spoil the movie.Tom Hanks did a great job, Ron Howard did a great job, Audrey Tautou was delicious, and, of course, Sir Ian was fantastic.",4,1,5,25 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live.
","I went back to look at the two Chris Columbus-directed Harry Potter movies. These were the one that were more light fantasy and enjoyable in that light.Mr. Ollivander: Curious... very curious... Harry: Excuse me, sir, but what's curious? Mr. Ollivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix whose tailfeather resides in your wand gave another... just one other. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand... when its brother gave you that scar. Harry: And who owned that wand? Mr. Ollivander: We do not speak his name! The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why. But I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. Terrible! Yes. But great. This is the film that Harry discovers who he is. Others know more about him than he does. We are introduced to all the great characters that we have come to know and love: Daniel Radcliffe (with his clothes on), Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Tom Felton, and Robbie Coltrane, in particular.We see the spectacular art and set decorations, particularly in the Great hall by Stuart Craig (art director) and Stephanie McMillan (set decorator). Costune design by Judianna Makovsky and music by John Williams makes this a film to remember. The special effects were fantastic.With close supervision by author J.K. Rowling and unprecedented approval of all aspects of the movie, we know we are going to get something that will not upset book fans, and we did.",7,0,2,26 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The Goblet of Fire burns bright
","There was an old Mel Brooks film that I remember called The History of the World: Part I. The tag line suggested that 'from the dawn of man to the distant future, mankind's evolution (or lack thereof) is traced.' Of course, mankind's history cannot be touched in 92 minutes, and do not expect J.K. Rowling's work, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to be given just weight in 2 hours and 37 minutes - it cannot be done. Forget the book and just sit back and enjoy what Mike Newell has prepared for your enjoyment.My anticipation was palpable: a Mike Newell film from a J.K. Rowling book. There is no film on the planet that is funnier or more touching than Four Weddings and a Funeral. Newell directed his greatest achievement there. With Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, he has taken a great leap forward and given us a movie that is enjoyable to lovers of the books and anyone else who just wants to see a great movie.I totally agree with reviewer Desson Thomson who states: Director Mike Newell and screenwriter Steve Kloves (who has written all the Potter films) know their primary responsibility: to create three-ring spectacles like the whiz-bang, airborne game of Quidditch, or Harry's mighty tussles with otherworldly creatures. But they also allow time for the characters to breathe. (WP) This film was the best of the bunch, I would not be surprised in the least to see this film exceed $100 million in it's first weekend. I was at the first showing at my local theater yesterday and it was full. I do not know what all those kids were doing out of school on Friday!If nothing else, you have to see Brendan Gleeson as the latest addition to the Hogwarts staff, Mad-Eye Moody. As Manohla Dargis of the Times describes him: a man of garrulous temperament and removable parts, including a googly eye that he wears like a pirate's patch, Mad-Eye is a pip.A pip he was and the film was stupendous.",9,1,2,19 November 2005

We will have our turn.I do not think that the trees and grass will finally get fed up with us and eliminate us as a threat. But, M. Night Shyamalan postulates that as a possibility. His subtle, slow film that allows one to think about what we have done, what we are doing, and what the possible consequences are will not be a big hit with the viewers that are looking for transformers or zombies, or ass-kicking action, but it is a message that deserves to be heeded.Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel were perfect for this film.",6,1,4,6 June 2009

","I don't know. As zombie comedies go, this was funny, but it was not great. I might not have given it a rating as high as I did except for Bill Murray's cameo. That man can generate a laugh just by showing up.Jesse Eisenberg was good as a traveller trying to get across America and escape the zombies, but Woody Harrelson really carried the movie with his passion for killing zombies with whatever tools he could find.I was not really impressed with the two sisters, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin.If you like movies with lots of blood and gore, and is funny at the same time, then you need to check this out.",6,1,1,3 July 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," Inspiration or horror film?
","This piece of Capra-corn certainly inspires a lot of thought. many of us watch it over and over every single year. It's an institution.But, there are rumblings that it really is a horror film.George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) tells his fiancé Mary (Donna Reed), 'I'm shaking' the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and I'm gonna see the world, Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then, I'm comin' back here to go to college and see what they know. And then I'm gonna build things. I'm gonna build airfields, I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high, I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.' Mary wishes that he would stay, and he ends up in the Building and Loan with Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) trying to hold off Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Why didn't he just run off with Violet (Gloria Grahame) and have some fun? Maybe if he had traveled like Harry (Todd Karns) and Sam (Frank Albertson), he might have learned some things that would have helped the whole country instead of just Bedford Falls.Oh, well, that wouldn't have worked for Frank Capra, but it's fun to dream. While I'm dreaming I just sit back and watch it again.",9,0,4,14 December 2007
Enemy at the Gates," In the forest, the wolf lives for three years and the donkey for nine.
","Your jaw drops as you see Russian recruits charging German lines in Stalingrad, and then being shot by their own when they try to retreat. You know this film is going to show a carnage of the greatest magnitude.Amidst the carnage, Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) meets Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a man with deadly aim. When Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) visits, Danilov proposes that they use all means to promote Vassili's skill to increase the morale of the people. Soon, like Sergeant York, his legend grows throughout Stalingrad, and the people are temporarily happy. As Khrushchev says, 'Vodka is a luxury we have, caviar is a luxury we have, time we do not have.' The problem is that the German bring in Major König (Ed Harris) to find Vasilli. Konig is just as good as Vasilli, maybe better, and a cat and mouse game begins.The always lovely Rachel Weisz is there, and Danilov is pursuing her aggressively, while Vasilli looks on longingly. Another contest? Danilov and König prove they are above nothing in their quest for glory, even setting up one for a kill, or killing a child. One hopes for the end of both of them.A very satisfying story about a Hero of the Soviet Union.",8,2,4,18 April 2010

I'd still be You-Know-Where. So I'd just like to say: thanks. Harry: There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid. The usual cast is back, as Richard Harris is still with us.

Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished yet.
","Non one would ever suggest that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie did not have chemistry. It was there all over the movie, just as it is in their lives.One would think that, and the explosive action would be enough to make this a good film, rather than just OK. It's not.Sure, it was funny, and the action was practically non-stop, but that was it. The premise is so outlandish to be unbelievable and distracting. The body count did seem a bit extreme, and there was little dialog for a married couple.And, damn it, this should have been an R with a little more action in the bedroom.",7,0,3,22 July 2007
The Departed," Remakes are seldom as good as the original
","I started my day with 2046. I won't recommend that film to any but fans of Tony Leung (Mou gaan dou, Ying xiong), Li Gong (Miami Vice, Memoirs of a Geisha) and Ziyi Zhang Memoirs of a Geisha, Ying xiong). The music was excellent and Tony Leung's performance was spellbinding, but the movie was hard to follow.I only mention Tony Leung because his performance in Mou gaan dou was on my mind as I watched The Departed, which is a remake of that film. I wish I had a copy with me to watch again and remind me of why it is such a favorite, but I have seen it enough times to know that it still stand above the new version.I just couldn't wait any longer, so I bought my copy yesterday and sat down with some chips to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio was magnificent. I have never been a big fan of Leonardo. I really liked him in Gangs of New York and Catch Me If You Can, but this performance was over the top. Having said that, I can't really think of another character's performance in The Departed that is worth mentioning. It ran 50 minutes longer than Mou gaan dou and the extra time was really a waste as it did not add anything to the film. The setup in the beginning was really a bore. Scorcese did so much better work in Gangs of New York and Goodfellas, one of my favorite films. I really don't see him winning an Oscar for this film, though they will probably give it to him for ignoring his earlier and better work.",8,8,13,18 February 2007
Glory Road," It's a long and winding road to Glory
","I was discussing affirmative action the other day and encountered the usual argument about those things that happened in our great grandfather's day. Having grown up in the South, I am well aware that many of the things that happened in 'my' day are still going on to some extent. I was high enough up the food chain in the military to hear conversations behind closed doors. In the small Arkansas town I grew up in, blacks lived across the tracks and up the hill - they probably still do.A.O. Scott comments in the New York Times about Glory Road: 'Glory Road finds its true story at a point where sports history intersects with the struggle for racial equality. The annals of postwar America are full of such moments, but few of them are as astonishing and consequential as the 1966 N.C.A.A. championship game, in which Don Haskins, coach of the Miners of Texas Western (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso), sent five black players onto the floor against Adolph Rupp's all-white University of Kentucky team.' Forget about Josh Lucas, Tatyana Ali, Emily Deschanel, or Jon Voight. They were incidental to the film and could have easily been replaced with others. The story of the Texas Western basketball players in 1966 is what Glory Road is all about.It happened in 1966. I was a sophomore in High School. I knew no more about Civil Rights or black oppression that the next guy. The only thing I knew for sure was that we used a two-handed set shot, not jumpers or Michael Jordan moves. It's the same criticism that I have of Hoosiers, another great basketball film. It wasn't my great grandfather's day; it was mine. It still is. If you are not moved by this film, then you are part of what was wrong then and what is not corrected to this day. It was about respect and the need for humans to give each other their due and not dwell on stupidity. We were all cut from the same cloth many many generations ago in Africa. I came to Florida from West Texas and know the area well. Color is not important there when it comes to sports. We've gotten past that. It is time to get past it in other areas of our lives. If Glory Road can help a little bit in that, then it is well worth your time.Well, it's well worth your time anyway as it is a great movie. As Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post said: It's one helluva story, and if this moving, and even thrilling little movie finally brings Haskins and a truly great American sports story to light, then three cheers and hooray.",9,9,21,13 January 2006
Psycho," A boy's best friend is his mother.
","Picking the best Hitchcock film to watch is an exercise that will totally frustrate you. There are so many great ones. When it comes to terror, no film can beat this one. Rear Window may edge it out (only by a hair) for excellence, but not for sheer terror.I really didn't recall the humorous set up in the beginning with Frank Albertson, but it did provide a way for Oscar nominee Janet Leigh and John Gavin to finally find happiness. Hard to believe a boss (Vaughn Taylor) would allow an employee to take the equivalent of $277,000 to the bank alone.I cannot understand why Oscar nominee Anthony Perkins wasn't at least nominated for his role here. I guess I couldn't think of one nominee that I could replace that year. Burt Lancaster won the Oscar for Elmer Gantry. Perkins did win at Cannes the same year for Goodbye Again.There were some other great actors in the film: Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Anderson, and John McIntire ('Wagon Train').Great direction, great cinematography and a great story.",9,0,1,14 March 2010

","Roman Polanski's brilliant direction and outstanding performances by Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon made this creepy film a real pleasure to watch.It is not really a horror film, even though there was a rape by witches and warlocks or something, as the rape scene was so stylized that it was not horrible at all.What is creepy is the was her husband (John Cassavetes) seems to be a part of what is going on.Sidney Blackmer was also very effective as the strange husband of Minnie Castevet (Gordon). The two of them made a weird pair.Strange things happen to anyone that gets in the way.One knows what is going to happen and there is nothing we can do but watch as Rosemary suffers.",9,1,3,27 June 2009

I could not imagine better casting in these roles. I was impressed with both performances.I also though Jude Law was great, and I have a new found respect for Jack Black in what I consider the best performance of his career.I was thrilled to see Eli Wallach (King of the Corner) in an outstanding performance.Great music, great acting, superb script and direction by Nancy Meyers, and two of the cutest girls you have ever seen - Miffy Englefield and Emma Pritchard.A real treat.",7,5,6,14 October 2007

It's then that he gets his life together and quits drinking.He starts writing songs again and he does well.Bridges was magnificent in a formula film that has been made many times before.

Love Actually," You know, Sammy, I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary, but... the general wisdom is that, in the end, there isn't just one person for each of us.
","Watching this film, I couldn't help notice that life imitates art, with Liam Neeson suffering the loss of his wife, and now having to raise a young son (Thomas Sangster). He was, of course, simply magnificent.The real attraction for me was, of course, Hugh Grant. No, I am not gay, but I love that guy in everything he does. His attraction to Martine McCutcheon was so funny and worth the price of admission alone.But, there are 10 love stories in this movie, and each has its own particular charm, and fascinating characters.Keira Knightley was absolutely beautiful and a real delight in her character; Alan Rickman played a softer character than I have ever seen, and was magnificent; there were so many great characters like Colin Firth, Carla Vasconcelos, Emma Thompson, and Billy Bob Thornton. Did I mention High Grant? It was all tied together nicely by a magnificent performance by Bill Nighy.",8,1,3,22 March 2009

They had some great support from an interesting cast that included Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma) and some really horrible-looking vampires.The makeup was really beautiful and the teeth were terrifying.A really great vampire movie.",7,1,4,24 April 2008
There Will Be Blood," I... drink... your... milkshake! I drink it up!
","I have to say that this is the most powerful performance I have seen from a man. Daniel Day Lewis was just about the most evil, heartless, opportunistic sociopath that I ever hope to come across. His performance was mesmerizing.The cinematography for this film was also very good. It was a real pleasure to watch.Well, that's it. Even though the film spanned several decades, it was too long. It felt like decades before it finished. The final scene was pointless. Plainview had beaten everyone, that should have been satisfaction enough. The final act showed him to really be a madman.The remaining characters in the film were just props for Plainview. They added nothing. They were the straight-men to his insanity.The opportunity to see the outstanding performance of Lewis was enough to recommend the movie.

To Kill a Mockingbird," Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passing.
","With three wins among eight Oscar nominations, this is one of the best pictures of all times. Gregory Peck won one of those Oscars for what is certainly his best performance.It was Mary Badhams first film, and she received a well-earned nomination for her performance as Scout. It was also Phillip Alford's first film. Both of these children performed as well as many actors with years more experience. Of course, Horton Foote's Oscar-winning screenplay, based upon Harper Lee's novel contributed immensely, but the two young actors really made you believe you were watching real characters.In an interesting note, it was also Robert Duvall's first film. He was the 'Boo' Radley referred to throughout and not seen until the end.The summation given by Peck has to be one of the greatest of all times, and he truly was, in the words of Miss Maudie, 'born to do our unpleasant jobs for us...'

The Bridge on the River Kwai," Madness! Madness!
","What could one possibly add to the accolades this film has had heaped upon it. The fact that it may not be historically accurate is of no consequence, as it was made for the theater, not the History Channel. David Lean's master piece showing the madness of war stands the test of time.It swept the Oscars in 1958, winning Best Picture, Best Director for Lean, Best Actor for Alec Guinness in the role that defines him, and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Sessue Hayakawa. It also took the awards for Writing. Music, Editing and Cinematography.Guinness was a perfect example of British pride. If you are going to do a job, then do it right. In that, he managed to take care of his men at the same time.William Holden was a perfect example of a soldier who just wanted to go home, as I am sure was the feeling of most. He recognized the madness of war long before the good doctor.This is a film that you can watch year after year and never get tired of it.",10,4,8,2 March 2008
Man on Fire," Denzel is the Man!
","Denzel Washington just can't make a bad movie. There is nothing he has been in that I do not love. No, I am not gay, I just think he is one of the very best. Man on Fire is no exception. The story is been told many times by actors such as Sylvester Stallone or Wesley Snipes or Steven Segal, but no one brings the passion and depth to a character like Washington. A man with nothing left, who can't even believe he can be forgiven for what he has done, sets about to make amends for his sins and restore balance to the world. Denzel does it like no one else can. He is the man! I have to also admit that Dakota Fanning was absolutely adorable in this film, and I haven't seen Rachel Ticotin since Con Air - she played a great supporting role. This is one of those films that do not diminish with re-watching like The Mighty Quinn or Devil in a Blue Dress or The Bone Collector or any other Denzel film you can name.",9,4,6,25 September 2005
Downfall," In a war as such there are no civilians.
","Despite it's 2 1/2 to 3 hour length, Oliver Hirschbiegel's film never slows for one second. This is a testament to his brilliant direction.What is also brilliant is the acting of Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler. I have never seen such emotion brought to a role.What really impresses is the stark realism of the film. You actually feel as if you are there when the Nazi world is crumbling.Another great aspect of the film is seeing the humanism of the people. Some were thoroughly consumed with the Nzai madness, some were in a trance with their love of Hitler, and some, like Albert Speer, actually defied his orders. All were aghast at his madness at the end.This film is a must-see ans I wish that it could be shown in High Schools across America to show the reality of aggression. The utter disdain for the people of Germany was so evident throughout that it was scary.",10,5,8,20 June 2007
Army of Darkness," I may be bad... but I feel gooood.
","Is this Sam Raimi's best film pre-Spider Man 2? Some would argue that this A-List director made his best mark in Evil Dead 2. That was certainly a great film, but I have an affinity for time-travel, and found this film to be as good, if not better.The makeup and horror was superb, but Bruce Campbell was just so funny in a land where he stood out like a sore thumb, I could not help but enjoy myself immensely. In fact, I really cannot comment on the rest of the cast except to say that they supported Campbell well. It was his movie, and he delivered his lines in a manner that makes me a fan.Why don't they turn those video games into more Evil Dead movies so I can see more of his crazy antics?",8,1,2,4 November 2007
The Last King of Scotland," You must find a way to get out.
","There is no doubt why Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin grabbed just about every award he was nominated for. He was just incredible in the picture and really played the character just as I imagined he would be in real life.But we would be remiss if we did not also celebrate the performance of James McAvoy (Wimbledon) as Dr. Garrigan, a naive young man in the shadow of his father who got in so deep that he had no way of knowing how to get out. It was his supporting role playing off Idi Amin, that allowed Whoitaker to make his character so good.Kudos to a fantastic script (Writers are important!) and a good performance by Kerry Washington (Ray, Mr & Mrs Smith) as Kay Amin.I really liked this movie and want to see it again.",8,0,3,11 November 2007

She was better than I have ever seen her since 3000 Miles to Graceland, which she actually did after this film; I just didn't see them in order. I really liked the cute reference to her BFF: 'It was just my head, it was Jennifer Aniston's body!' The best part of the movie was trying to guess the killer. I was so out there and never had a clue. That alone made it worth watching.Let's see what they come up with next in Scream 3.",5,0,4,18 August 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Listen to them: the children of the night. What sweet music they make.
","I confess that having seen many Dracula movies, I only tuned into this to see Monica Belucci. I was not denied a beautiful treat in observing her bounteous charms, if only briefly. How could Keanu Reeves complain of being held captive by such beauty. But, I was in for an even greater treat to come.Gary Oldman is the ultimate Dracula. His performance was so fantastic that it will make you forget all others. Sir Anthony Hopkins was equally brilliant as Van Helsing.Of course, their great performances were barely noticeable when Sadie Frost was baring her milky white crumpets. She was fantastic! But, we mustn't dismiss the excellent performance of Wynona Ryder. She may have only given us a brief covered view of her bouncing beauties as she chased after her friend, but her acting was superb in all respects. To the best of my knowledge the Ryder cups have never been shown. She was integral to the overriding sensuality of this great love story.The music, the makeup, the costumes, the sets; all were beyond outstanding in this film that was a real treat to all senses.",9,0,1,7 August 2008
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Willis and Jackson shine!
","There are great buddy flicks out there - Mel Gibson and Danny Glover probably define the genre; and, there is plenty of action in all the Die Hard flicks, but this film combines both in a package that is a pure joy to watch. Bruce Willis (John McClane) and Samuel L. Jackson (Zeus) make an outstanding combination in a film that has non stop action as they try to catch the brother of Han Gruber (Die Hard), Simon (Jeremy Irons (Elizabeth I, Kingdom of Heaven).McClane and Zeus stretch the limits of believability in taking a beating in this film. You just can't believe that McClane can even get up after his last beating, much less run and jump.So, if you want to see two stars shine in an action vehicle with great dialog, this is your pick.",7,0,0,7 April 2007
American Gangster," Frank Lucas don't run from nobody.
","Well, he should have run from Russell Crowe. So, he makes a deal and gets off with 15 years. What about all those people he killed, Richie? I was anxious to see this film as I am a Denzel Washington fan, but I have to say that it does not live up to the hype. I would watch The Godfather or Goodfellas again before I watch this film a second time.Yes, Denzel was good, but he really didn't have a lot to work with as far as a story. The real story was Richie's efforts to bring down the corrupt cops. That's been done so many times, that you just think of New York cops as corrupt.A best supporting actress award nomination for Ruby Dee? Give me a break. She had one scene of note. She's a great actress, but not in this movie, folks.Me, I'm looking for Thieves and Liars so I can see some more of Lymari Nadal.",7,0,1,14 May 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," I don't need a nicotine patch. I smoke cigarettes.
","Of course this film had to end the way it did. If not, then all those existential musings of the author would not mean much. Slightly sappy, but nonetheless thoughtful, it is designed to make you appreciate the little things in your otherwise meaningless existence.Is your life a comedy or a tragedy? Crick (Will Ferrell) tries to answer that question put to him by Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Can a cookie from Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal) change your life from black to white? I know she can change my life! Author Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) realizes her life is lonely, as lonely as her character, and decides to make a change. She went for 'good,' not 'great.' Is that what it is all about? We can achieve 'good' in our lives, but to achieve 'great,' we must eschew the sappy and mundane feelings?

The Reader," It isn't what you think or feel; it's what you do that counts.
","If Kate Winslet, who won a Golden Globe for this performance, does not win the Oscar for the same role, then there is no justice in the world. She was absolutely incredible in a role that had her go from predator, to victim; from seemingly oblivious to the magnitude of what she did, to someone willing to take blame that wasn't hers to avoid embarrassment.It is extremely hard to critique this film without giving away the magnificent plot, so I will try my best to avoid anything that would do that.Bruno Ganz played a law professor that was critical to enjoying this movie because he made us think about the role of the individual, of the collective, of society, of everyone in the horrible massacre that was the Holocaust, and also makes us think of our role in the massacres that are going on around the world in Darfur and Iraq. Are we responsible by doing nothing? Can we really say we do not know what is going on? It was pointed out that there were 1000 concentration camps. Every German knew. What was their responsibility? What of the responsibility of the 52 million Americans who voted for Bush in 2004 knowing what was happening in Iraq and Guantanamo? One cannot avoid the comparisons, although the Jews had it far worse.Ralph Fiennes put in an incredibly good performance, but nothing compared to Winslet. She solidified her acting credentials in this amazing film.",9,3,5,13 January 2009
Jaws," This shark, swallow you whole.
","I don't know if this was Steven Spielberg Day or Shark Day.I started the day with Spielberg's first theatrical film, The Sugarland Express. I then watched a really good shark film, Red Water. I ended my afternoon viewing with Spielberg's second feature, the one that put him on the map, Jaws. Two Spielbergs and two sharks. An exciting day.What can you say about this film that others have missed. Oscars for editing, score and sound; outstanding direction by Spielberg; superb acting by Richard Dreyfuss; and a Peter Benchley story that kept your interest throughout.I was just thrilled to see it again.",8,0,2,25 August 2007
The Wrestler," And now, I'm an old broken down piece of meat... and I'm alone.
","Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) talks about The Passion of the Christ, and how he took everything they threw at him. After seeing the match with Ram (Mickey Rourke) and Necro (Dylan Keith Summers), it was an apt comparison. It may all be fake, but the injuries were real enough.Rourke was absolutely perfect for the role of a washed-up wrestler. He looked the part and he acted like he was really feeling the pain. Hell, I was feeling the pain! Seeing the wrestlers plan their moves beforehand, and seeing the crappy places they work in, and seeing the old one just fade away, was all fascinating.He is try to reestablish a relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), and he really wants to settle down with Cassidy. He just doesn't want to die alone. He knows he is just a one-trick pony and he does it his way.This is a comeback for Rouke and he really did come back - an Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe, and Independent Spirit Award; among others. He really is on the road to recovery.",9,1,3,23 April 2009
Hancock," Did you shove a man's head up another man's ass?
","OK, the concept is funny. A 'super hero' that is nothing but a lush and causes so much damage that the mayor wants him to leave; 'Go to New York.' I only tuned in to see Charlize Theron. I'd watch her in anything; even a PG-13 film designed to appeal to People's and Teen Choice audiences.Jason Bateman is a loser PR agent that is going to re-create Hancock and make him as lovable as Superman.Bateman doesn't know about his wife (Theron). Hancock finds out from her about his past.Some exciting action, but you would be better off with Eddie Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop.",6,0,2,24 June 2009
Shooter," You don't understand how serious this is. They killed my dog.
","I liked Mark Wahlberg in Invincible, and hated him in The Departed, but I think this is where he really will find his niche. He is perfect as a Marine that is conned by greedy politicians and military brass and who dons a Rambo persona (with intelligence) to take revenge.John Cena makes a good Marine, but Wahlberg is more believable. He is more like someone who is real, and he made this film enjoyable.What I really enjoyed was the politics intertwined in the film. We all know that Iraq is 'blood for oil,' and they put that in in an unassuming was that drove the point home.A little tweaking and this could have been a great movie, but it was still really good.",7,1,4,3 August 2008
Defiance," If we should die, trying to live, then at least we die like human beings.
","The brothers: Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), Zus Bielski (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell) hide in the forest to escape the Germans. Soon, they are among a group of Jews. This group successfully defied the Nazis, hid in the forest and maintained a self-contained society while losing only about 50 of their some 1,200 members. The 'Bielski Partisans' represented the war's largest and most successful group of Jewish resisters.Of course, Romance blossoms as 'forest wives' soon replace 'village wives.' and Tuvia and Zus battle constantly over which is more important - saving the people, or fighting the Germans.Alexa Davalos, Jodhi May, Kate Fahy, and Iben Hjejle provided diversion for the men.Not an excessive amount of fighting, the story was mainly about life in the forest and doing what you have to to survive another day.",7,3,7,25 August 2009
Lord of War," I don't want to be remembered at all. That means I'm dead.
","I watched two Cage films the other night. This was one that I had not seen previously. It was an extremely good satire about the arms business.That was the point of the film. Selling arms does not have a moral component. It is a business. After all, the United States is the biggest arms merchant in the world. We end up disarming countries of arms that we provided. Or arms we provided comes back to be used against us later.Nicolas Cage was brilliant in this film. He was cool and calm and just what I would expect of an arms merchant. After the cold war ends, he immediately realizes that he can get access to Russian stockpiles and make a fortune.Of course, Ethan Hawke is trying to prevent him from making all that money, but Cage is just too cool. He wins every time.I don't think the film could be summed up better than when Cage tells an audience, 'I never sold to Osama Bin Laden. Not on moral grounds, but because his checks were always bouncing back then.'",9,1,2,23 May 2007
WALL·E," I don't want to survive. I want to live.
","I am not a fan of animated movies in any form. The only one I recall that was worth watch was Fritz the Cat back in the 70s. That one was X-Rated (NC-17 today).Of course, I had to watch this, not because it won Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards, but because there was a push to get it nominated for Best Picture period. It did win a couple of Best Picture awards from film critics, but the Academy wasn't buying it.I feel that it did meet the requirements for consideration as Best Picture, as it presented a story that was interesting and credible, and just had animated robots instead of humans. Of course, nominating it for Best Picture means someone would be left out, and I can't see that as there were other films that had a better claim to be included.It was charming, tender, funny, and exciting. A film that is worth watching over and over.",9,3,5,25 February 2009
The Good Shepherd," You are never to tell anyone what it is that I do!
","I have a newfound respect for Matt Damon's acting abilities. To maintain his stoic presence through this long film was remarkable. Only the lovely Tammy Blanchard could melt that single-minded devotion to duty.There was certainly too little screen time for the incredible Angelina Jolie, and she was remarkable every time she appeared. The very short performances of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci were also great. John Turturro was magnificent.Joseph Palmi (Pesci): Let me ask you something... we Italians, we got our families, and we got the church; the Irish, they have the homeland, Jews their tradition; even the n*ggers, they got their music. What about you people, Mr. Wilson, what do you have? Edward Wilson (Damon): The United States of America. The rest of you are just visiting.An incredible story about the agency that operates in shadows that we, as Americans, would really rather not know about.",7,1,2,24 December 2007

","Who is this woman? Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) picks up Big Mike (Quinton Aaron) and takes him home like it's the most natural thing in the world. Her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) knows better than to say a word. She is that kind of woman, and I certainly want to stick around to see what she does next.She is a formidable woman and with a great supporting cast that including Ray McKinnon and Kathy Bates, along with Jae Head and Lily Collins.I laughed all through the movie, but, what is more important, I was inspired by Leigh Ann Tuohy. I have always believed that you should live your life keeping in mind that you may be the only Bible someone ever reads. Leigh Ann lived the Christian life. It was reflected in her actions every day. This is Bullock's role and displays her talent like I have never seen Bring the Kleenex.",8,1,2,20 February 2010
Music and Lyrics," Are these pants a bit too tight?
","The basic formula for a Hugh Grant romantic movie never changes. Finds girl, loses girl, and rejoins girl to live happily ever after. That is why I love watching his movies. They are predictable and he is predictable and funny.He seems to match with some of the best women in the business. Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, Andie MacDowell in Four Weddings and a Funeral, Sandra Bullock in Two Weeks Notice, and now Drew Barrymore.Barrymore and Grant are perfect together. She has that infectious smile that makes her irresistible. They both have those charmingly quirky looks, and they just seem to fit well.It all makes for one of the best films he has done and one that I will watch over and over.",6,1,1,10 June 2007

","I have to admit that I was never a fan of teen slasher movies. I have started to get more into zombies lately and I got introduced to Rose McGowan (Grindhouse); I have always loved Neve Campbell since Wild Things, which she actually did after this, and, naturally I love Courteney Cox (3000 Miles to Graceland); and Drew Barrymore, who I hope to be seeing soon in Music and Lyrics.With all those lovely women collected in one movie, I just had to tune in. I am glad I did as it was hilarious. A spoof of slasher films that tu4rned out to spawn a new batch of slasher films.I just can't wait until Friday when i can see the sequel.",8,1,3,16 May 2007
Halloween," It was the boogeyman.
","John Carpenter's classic is definitely a scary film and a real treat.I will always think of Jamie Lee Curtis as that hooker with a heart of gold in Trading Places, but it was fun to see her as Laurie in her first film. She did a great job of fighting off the bogeyman.And there is P.J. Soles (Death by Engagement, The Devil's Rejects) that i remember from Private Benjamin. She was also great as Lynda:Lynda: It's totally insane. We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game is in the afternoon, I have to get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight! I'll be totally wiped out! Laurie: I don't think you have enough to do tomorrow.

Carrie," I can see your dirty pillows. Everyone will.
","I am sure that I've seen this film before, but I watched it again to see how Stephen King managed to write a story that captured teen-aged angst amidst bullying and popularity contests.Sis Spacek was simply incredible and it is no surprised that she got the first Academy Award nomination for a horror film. Piper Laurie was also superb as her mother and got a well-deserved nomination herself.The effects and cinematography were superb, as was Brian De Palma's direction.I also liked seeing some people in their first or early roles like Amy Irving (Yentl) in her first role on the big screen; RoboCop's Nancy Allen; John Travolta in his second screen appearance; and P. J. Soles (The Devil's Rejects) in one of her first roles.A great horror movie about teen life.",7,2,5,1 March 2008
The Queen," Should have been the Oscar winner!
","56 awards and another 44 nominations. That has to be a record! Having seen all the Oscar nominees, I can now say that they should have won many more awards as this was the best film of last year and Stephen Frears was the best director, and Peter Morgan wrote the best screenplay.Everyone was talking Helen Mirren, and now I know why. She was absolutely marvelous in the role of the Queen. I never thought she could exceed her performance in Elizabeth I, but she did. She IS Queen Elizabeth! I was also impressed by James Cromwell as Prince Phillip. He played the Prince just as I imagine him to be.I don't know why Michael Sheen did not get more credit as Tony Blair. I thought he played the part beautifully.This whole movie was just as I imagined the real situation to have played out in the conflict between those who are upholding centuries of tradition and those who are sensitive to the people's feelings. No matter which side you come down on, this story and the actors in it really gave a performance of a lifetime.Sorry, Scorcese fans, this WAS the best film of 2006!",10,1,2,5 September 2007
Blow," Life passes most people by while they're making grand plans for it.

That is not surprising considering his childhood.He heads to California, and is soon hooked up with Barbara (Franka Potente) and her dealer friend (Paul Reubens). He is starting his road to riches.Soon, he is hitting the big time, using Barbara's job as a stewardess to move weed to the East Coast. But, it's not enough, so he strikes out to Mexico. He now has more money than he knows what to do with.He steps up and is soon dealing with Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) and dealing coke instead of weed. It wasn't long before he was dealing about 85% of the coke in America, and had literally boxes of money in his apartment.He eventually hooks up with Penelope Cruz after Barbara dies. What a crazy woman! Soon, it's all over. He tries to go straight, but you really can't.A really tragic ending.",7,1,2,3 April 2010
Raging Bull," Fighting demons, not boxers
","I don't know what took me so long to see this movie, but I jumped at the chance last night. I know it was nominated for a slew of awards, but that is not why I tuned in.It was Joe Pesci's fourth film and he really shows the tough guy that he was to later develop in movies like Goodfellas and casino. His performance in trying to control his out of control brother was amazing.Now, of course, Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta was also impressive. To see someone with so little self esteem that he was beset by constant doubt is sad. he was an amazing fighter, but never happy as he dealt with his demons.Antone wanting to see outstanding acting directing technical work in a great story needs to see this film. It is one of the best of all time.",9,6,9,14 April 2007
The Silence of the Lambs," Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head.
","What in the world could you say about this film that hasn't already been mentioned? With 39 awards, and another 27 nominations, it is certainly a film for the ages.Revisiting it after watching Hannibal Rising was a real treat.To see the performances of Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in what is truly the roles of their careers was indescribable.What can you say about directing, writing, sound, and a script that was just perfect, and held me glued to the screen for two hours.A magnificent thriller. I have seen it multiple times, and I so enjoyed seeing it again today.",9,3,5,5 October 2008
Any Given Sunday," Stone & Pacino together again
","I like pretty much every sports movie I watch. There are exceptions. That stupid golf movie with the magical crap. You want golf? Watch Tin Cup. Friday Night Lights is the real deal. The natural is the epitome of baseball films. Here, we have the NFL in all it's gritty glory as a money machine.Pacino as an aging coach gives a great performance. I found him to be truly believable. Cameron Diaz gives the best performance of her career, with the possible exception of Gangs of New York. Dennis Quaid and James Woods are a positive addition to any film, and they don't disappoint here. Jaime Foxx gave the performance that put him on the road to stardom.Sorry, NFL fans, but watching this is better than the real thing.",8,0,1,25 April 2007
Iron Man," Iron Man rocks!!!!!
","I don't want to hear from those comic book readers on whether or not this is a true representation. This is the movie, and it rock! Robert Downey Jr. was born for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, and I cannot wait to see him later this Summer in The Incredible Hulk, and in Iron Man II, which just has to be made.Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is just the hottest assistant a man can have, and I cannot, for the life of me, understand why he is not... every day.The two of them together is just screen magic and the banter between them is just so charged with sexual energy - it is just amazing.Terrence Howard was great as his Air Force buddy, and Jeff Bridges was perfect as the man you wanted to see die - every more than the terrorists, and you know that is the truth.The special effects were absolutely out of this world.If there is any criticism of all of this movie, it is that it could have been more adult. A little fun with Leslie Bibb, the stews on the plan giving us a real pole dance...Ah, but they have to tone it down to get the bucks from the teens.It still rocks.",9,1,3,6 May 2008
Blade Runner," Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave.
","There is no disputing the fact that this film was visually stunning. The contrast between the rich and poor, the bright lights and the crumbling buildings, the constant rain and darkness; all made for a beautiful picture.In addition, the music of Vangelis was more than appropriate for the film. It was a treat to the ear.But, that said, the story itself was a disappointment. There really just didn't seem to be much there that would qualify this film to be considered a classic.I watched as a tribute to Harrison Ford. He had that same edge that he had in Raiders of the Lost Ark, released the year before. He had a maturity that was missing in Star Wars. He was totally believable in this role.But that was it. A minute or two of Joanna Cassidy to titillate, a clownish Darryl Hannah, and a conflicted Rutger Hauer did nothing to make this anything more than a showcase for Ford.It was an enjoyable experience, but still a disappointment.",6,3,7,4 June 2008
Casino Royale," Trying to sell margarine as butter
","Daniel Craig is not James Bond despite the fact that we have been subjected to a 2 and one half hour sales presentation. No, this was not a Bond movie but an attempt to convince us that we needed Craig. They failed miserably.Yes, I am upset that Pierce Brosnan was replaced, but I really tried to forget that while I watched this movie. I wanted to give it a fair chance.Some may criticize the title sequence for lack of the traditional Bond women, but I thought it was absolutely brilliant. It was one of the best titles I have seen.The chase in the beginning was also a masterpiece. I kept think that this would make for a real Olympic Decathalon competition. I know it is all movie magic, but I forgot that while I was watching - it was that good.After that, the movie over over. Craig is not Bond. He looks too old and has no sophistication. Bond is not a cold killing machine. He performs his job with flair and style. Craig has none of that.And, what's with this torture? That belongs in 24, not a Bond movie.Eva Green is extremely lovely, but was totally wasted in this film.There were no Bond women in this film. That would have distracted us from the sales job on Craig.I'm not buying.",6,4,11,6 May 2007
Trainspotting," With God's help I'll conquer this terrible affliction.
","The last time I remember seeing someone going through withdrawal was Frank Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm: 'You mean just stop? Cold turkey? You don't understand! The pain...' Renton (Ewan McGregor) was a little more expressive: 'I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post. That's for sure. I'm in the junkie limbo at the moment. Too ill to sleep. Too tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat, chills, nausea. Pain and craving. A need like nothing else I've ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on its way.' The truth about drugs and the awful toll it take is clearly shown here. The most awful moment come after the baby dies and the mother is quick to 'relieve her pain.' The most disgusting moment was the toilet: an apt illustration of just what you will do for drugs. The amorality of sex with a schoolgirl is also apropos.This film is funny at times, but certainly there was no glamor. It was just some sick people with their lives going in circles.John Hodge's screenplay was magnificent. Danny Boyle's (Shallow Grave, 28 Days Later...) direction was super. Along with McGregor, the performances of Robert Carlyle (The Full Monty, Human Trafficking) and Kelly Macdonald (What's her connection to Sinatra?) were impressive.",8,8,11,22 December 2007
La Vie En Rose," She is nobody's child
","Golden Globe winner and Oscar nominee Marion Cotillard was absolutely brilliant in this performance. I have never seen anyone who had such range in character.As to the story itself, it was brilliant, also. If this has been today, we would be watching the story of Britney Spears or Amy Winehouse. Piaf was the pop diva of the day in France and lived the life. She was addicted to drugs and alcohol and treated her baby in much the way she was treated by her mother.It has been said that the film is frantically trying to get all the details of Piaf's life and barely touches many subjects. In a sense that is true.The movie did not clearly show that she was blind for four years when her father left her in the whorehouse with his mother. The only real mother she had was Titine, the fabulously beautiful Emmanuelle Seigner (The Ninth Gate, Bitter Moon). It was not also clear in the movie how attached she was to her pimp. I am not sure that people realized that she left her first public performance to pay him so she would not get hurt or killed.Her downfall after the murder of Louis Leplée (Gérard Depardieu) and her rehabilitation by Raymond Asso (Marc Barbé) were dramatic and well done.Olivier Dahan (The Crimson Rivers II: The Angels of the Apocalypse, The Promised Life) has done a wonderful job in my humble opinion and the performance by Cotillard makes this film worth watching many times.The rendition of La Marseillaise by the 10-year-old makes this a keeper for me. I have been in love with that song since I first heard it in Casablanca, and give an automatic star to any movie that includes it.",8,2,5,10 February 2008
Before Sunrise," Who says relationships have to last forever?
","Where would you put Director Richard Linklater in a list of the Top 100 directors? Certainly not in the Top 50, but pretty close. His best work was Dazed and Confused, but he also did great work on Waking Life and Before Sunset, in addition to this film. He is in the same league as Pedro Almodovar and Sam Raimi.Julie Delpy (Before Sunset, Europa Europa) was magnificent in this romantic film as someone who joins Ethan Hawke (Before Sunset, Training Day) on a 12 hour adventure in Vienna, Austria.I am still amazed that two people who just met can talk almost non-stop for 12 hours. I would have had to take a break and watch the play. But they do it and give a beautiful picture of two people who find and discover each other like few can.The mystical versus the cynical, it was a great exploration of the art of conversation.",8,1,2,6 October 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," The trick is to enjoy life, accepting it has no meaning whatsoever.
","I recall seeing a Woody Allen film before. I believe it was Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask. I don't really recall it, and it was so long ago. If this film is a typical Woody Allen film, then I have been cheating myself out of great pleasure for a long time.Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, Patricia Clarkson, and Penélope Cruz were all fascinating, especially Cruz, not to diminish the fine performances from all of them.The story was amazing. I was mesmerized for the entire 96 minutes. I could not miss one word of the dialog. The direction was perfect and it was definitely one of the best films of 2008.And, did I mention that Penélope Cruz deserved her Oscar and every other award she got for this role?",9,2,7,3 May 2009
Beowulf," I shall make you the greatest king that ever lived
","When I heard that Ray Winstone was cast as Beowulf and was only 5' 5', I wondered why. Seeing him act, I have no doubts that they knew what they were doing. The benefit of CGI and Motion capture puts a great actor in a mythic role. A perfect fit.Another perfect fit was Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother. I mean she was just an animated figure, but Oh what an animated figure. Angelina never looked so beautiful as she did here. There is no doubt why no one could resist her charms.The movie was just an incredible experience with fine actors (Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, and a really believable Crispin Glover, as well as Winstone and Jolie), and an ending battle that will leave you breathless. The beauty of this film is something to behold.Robert Zemeckis has outdone himself and told a tale that will last until some greater technology comes along. We have a true hero her - it is Beowulf!",10,13,30,16 November 2007
Fantastic Mr. Fox," If what I think is happening is happening - it better not be.
","I seldom watch these types of films. I am more interested in good acting than cartoons. However, I have to say that I am glad I did.This was an excellent film with some characters that looked and acted very real.My favorite is, of course, Mrs. Fox, played by Meryl Streep. She had all she could do to control Mr. Fox (Geaorge Clooney.Outside of a couple of notables, the rest of the cast appeared to be Wes Anderson regulars. Since I cannot say anything good about them, I just let it go.Anderson did a good job of keeping the action flowing in a tale of thievery ending with the great escape.All-in-all a film well worth the time.",8,1,3,30 April 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," You just killed a helicopter with a car!
","If there is a god, then I will live to see at least four more John McClane adventures before I die. I do not know how much longer Bruce Willis can endure the pain, even if it is fake. He has to be tired of constantly killing evildoers. He certainly stretched my imagination this time. Knocking an evildoer out of a helicopter with a fire hydrant was better that Rambo's rock, and who wou7ld have guessed that a semi could beat a jet? I just saw Justin Long in Accepted the other day and I was impressed with his ability. I am really impressed now, as he was perfect in the role of the nerd who grew some balls and became 'that guy.' The amazingly hot Maggie Q was amazing as the 'Asian hooker bitch.' Too bad she didn't know that martial arts won't work on McClane as he just keeps coming at you.I've seen Timothy Olyphant in several movies and really not paid much attention to him. I didn't pay too much attention here either as his role was pretty insignificant as the pretentious asshole who thinks he is better than anyone and finally meets a real man and can't last 60 seconds.Willis, you are the man when it comes to action and I hope you are around for a long time.",8,1,3,9 January 2008
The Ringer," An absolute disaster
","I do not know why I watched this movie. I should have watched Olbermann and Monk instead. I have never seen a Johnny Knoxville film, and I can only recall maybe one or two Farrelly brothers productions I have seen in the past. I sincerely regret the time I spent on this mess.For full disclosure, I have to state that I work every day helping those with developmental disabilities improve their lives. I know these individuals intimately and see the daily struggle just to work, have relationships and lead lives that we take for granted. To see them mocked by this film was painful.No, I did not laugh once. Was this supposed to be a comedy? I didn't even crack a smile. There is nothing funny about pretending to have a developmental disability no matter what the motivations are. And, apologizing or making up for your sin is not enough. The only satisfying response to what was done was by the Priest who kicked Knoxville's ass down the Church steps. That should be a punishment for the Farrelly brothers as well.",1,2,12,3 March 2007
Amélie," It's better to help people than garden gnomes.
","Five Oscar nominations; two BAFTAs, and six more nominations; four CÃ©sars and nine more nominations; and a Golden Globe nomination. There is no doubt that this was one of the best films of 2001, and one of the films that you should definitely put on your list to see.This film, starring cute Audrey Tautou (The Da Vinci Code) in the title role, is like an Ã‰clair: sweet and delicious - a treat to be savored. It is colorful and whimsical and shows a Paris that only exists in the movies. But, there is enough sadness in the world. Sometimes you just need to sit back and enjoy life.AmÃ©lie never got love or affection at home so, when she finds an old box of treasures, she seeks the owner hoping for satisfaction. She gets it and resolves to spend her life doing good for others.It is the tricks she plays on those who are mean that are hilarious.She gets two lonely people together with unexpected consequences. Isabelle Nanty was superb as the hypochondriac.She brings joy to a lonely and bitter widow.Her imagination is stupendous! She helped others, but love eluded her until she found the courage to jump into it.Serge Merlin was excellent as Raymond Dufayel, a painter who stayed in his apartment alone. Jamel Debbouze (Angel-A) was fantastic as Lucien, as was Rufus as her father.Everything about the film: the direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the writing by Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant, the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel, the editing, the sound - it was all top shelf.",9,2,8,30 April 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
","I tuned into this because it was Johnny Depp's first movie and I wanted to see what he was like at 21 years old. I hardly recognized him. I really didn't at first. I had to keep staring and I still wasn't sure.Anyway, Wes Craven has written and directed a classic horror picture. Is it real or is it a dream? What is real? It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I guess that means it was great horror. I especially liked the bathtub scene. That was definitely creepy. I think I'll stick to showers.An those blades scraping against metal is like fingernails on a chalkboard.I hear the sequels are not as good as this one, but I'll probably be back just to see what happens.

Captain Stottlemeyer!), Hank Azaria, Danny Trejo, and many many more. It was like Hollywood all showed up for this one. I know it's an oldie, but it sure was a goodie. I never enjoyed an action movie so much. The tension and the action were over the top. And, that exchange between Pacino and DiNiro was one for the books. I just don't think they make action movies like this any more.",8,0,4,25 February 2007

","Has it been 30 years since we first enjoyed one of the most spectacular films of the 20th Century. This film is older than many of the people I know.Volumes have been written on the creativity and innovation that was brought forth by George Lucas. This film had it all: sets, costuming, visual effects, music, writing and directing. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were light years behind the rest of America when they ignored this film for some Woody Allen comedy. They really showed their bias there! It is hard to believe Harrison Ford had been around for 10 years before this film. He seemed so young and fresh, and we know he goes on to some great work after wards. He is the one I remember most fondly from the film. Of course, one will never forget Chewbacca.",9,1,2,19 May 2007
300," Made for the Big Screen
","I kick myself frequently for missing Frank Miller's Sin City on the big screen. I wish they would bring films like that back occasionally.Well, I wasn't going to miss this one and I am glad I didn't. It was a beautiful and impressive film. It was no Sin City, but it was an enjoyable way to spend two hours on a Saturday morning.One is tempted to start reading something into the film. Maybe an allegory about freedom fighters sacrificing their lives against an imperialist machine with their coalition of the bought and paid for and impressive and fearsome weapons, but I will not get drawn into that. I will say that the story of the Spartans at Thermopylae was as exciting as the story of William Wallace in Braveheart.The scenes with the Oracle were stunning and sensuous and one wants to see more of Kelly Craig. The dialog was typical Hoo Rah and seriously detracted from my enjoyment. I really didn't think the blood and gore was anything you wouldn't find in a video game rated M. It was certainly a lot less than Saving Private Ryan.All-in-all a good film and nothing that teens couldn't see. It was really a PG13.",8,3,8,10 March 2007
Cube," I'm not dying in a f*cking rat maze!
","How did I get here? Why am I here? How do I get out? Can I do it myself, or do I need someone to help me? Sounds like questions all of us who are trapped in a cubical life ask every day. These are some of the same questions being asked by a group in a fantastic cube, where a mistake in a decision can cost you your life.Worth (David Hewlett) had it down. We are so concerned with our pathetic little lives that we fail to see the big picture. That allows others to manipulate and control us. It's not a conspiracy; it's just that we have ceased to care. Nature abhors a vacuum, so someone will take control while we look the other way.Kazan (Andrew Miller) is autistic, and shows how we tend to dismiss the less fortunate when it suits us.The cop Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint) and the social worker Halloway (Nicky Guadagni) showed the opposite sides of the debate over what our society values - people or order.Those are just my observations, and I am sure others will make their own interpretations. It is horror and drama and a thriller that really makes you think.",8,0,1,16 January 2009
The Thin Red Line," War don't ennoble men. It turns them into dogs... poisons the soul.
","We have to take this rock. Director Terrence Malick made us look at something else. It wasn't a rock, it had trees, and people, and wildlife and real beauty before anyone outside the rock ever appeared.It also has human emotions and thoughts and dreams along with those who came to take this rock.Can you come back the same? Not likely. You will be changed by this rock and you will be a different man because of it.Some great actors appeared in this film, some in small parts, and some crucial to the film.I won't forget Nick Nolte as Lt. Col Tall. I've known many like him - passed over for promotion and looking for a chance at glory, no matter what the cost.Or Elias Koteas as Capt Staros, who cared about his men and looked at them as more than sacrifices for the war effort.Of course, you can't forget Sean Penn as that Sergeant that manages to keep it all together.Others will have their favorites, and everyone will take what they want from this movie.For me, it is war's futility.Everyone will experience a beautifully shot film that really was a pleasure.",8,3,7,7 December 2008
The Great Escape," Oh my God, they found Tom.
","Steve McQueen and James Garner lead a great ensemble cast in this great John Sturges directed war movie about an RAF escape attempt from a German POW camp.Outside of the Ocean's movies, there are not many great ensemble movies made these days due to the enormous salaries paid to the stars.It is an escape movie, but it plays like a caper flick. What they are stealing in this case, is their freedom. The setup is extremely complicated and fascinating. Of course, only 76 make it out instead of the planned 250, and not many experience freedom, but it still plays well after all these years.It is well worth watching again and again to see Steve McQueen's attempted escape on a motorcycle.",8,1,4,23 September 2007
Click," Thank G-D for fast forward
","Why o why did I waste my time with an Adam Sandler movie. I should know better. There is nothing funny about him. he is such a loser. I only tuned into this to see Kate Beckinsale. I did not expect a cardboard cutout. Anyone could have played her part. it was useless. Do you find farting in David Hasselhoff's face to be funny. I didn't. It was disgusting! Let's face it. If your wife is Kate Beckinsale and you would rather spend your time at work. You've got a problem that some remote won't fix.Of course, Jennifer Coolidge was funny, so it wasn't a total waste.",4,1,6,22 April 2007
Pineapple Express," War is upon you! Prepare to suck the cock of karma!
","Dale (Seth Rogen) is a process server who buys his drugs from Saul (James Franco). Serving a summons one night, he witnesses a murder by Ted Jones (Gary Cole) and a policewoman (Rosie Perez). Dale runs back to Saul for help, in the process starting a drug war between Ted and his Asian competition.Another player is Saul's dealer Red (Danny R. McBride), who already betrayed them to Ted. How he manages to live through this film amazes me.There are some very funny moments in this buddy film that includes the usual male bonding, immature sexual desires, verbal scatology, formidable drug abuse, fight scenes, gunfire, and explosions. What it doesn't include is the expected nudity, but Dale's girlfriend (Amber Heard) is a High school student after all.Saul getting his leg caught in a windshield was hilarious, the scene with Angie's (Heard) parents, played by Ed Begley Jr. and Nora Dunn was a riot. Cleo King as a school resource office was excellent.The comedy takes a back seat to action in the third act as the drug war goes full force.All is well that ends well as Angie is out of the picture and Dale, Saul and Red ride off into the sunset together.",7,0,2,11 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," There is a great disturbance in the Force.
","Sound, Art, Music, Special Effects, Costuming - these all make this a film worth revisiting on a Hi-Def TV. Even without the Hi-Def cable, this is a special film to watch and enjoy.It was just an amazing adventure that took me back to seeing it for the first time in 1980. I enjoyed the performances, and I especially enjoyed Harrison Ford, who I don't think gets enough credit for his job in this film. Yes, Mark Hamill is good, but I just thought Form was better.It is nice to go back and enjoy films like this. Even though the technology is better today, they were still special.",9,0,2,27 December 2007
The Ugly Truth," I like women on top.
","I know I am setting myself up for disappointment watching anything that was nominated at the Teen Choice Awards, but it is Gerard Butler (RocknRolla, Butterfly on a Wheel, 300).Oh, yes, there is some woman from 'Grey's Anatomy', whatever that is.She's (Katherine Heigl) the TV producer who has to put up with the caveman commentator (Butler) that her boss just hired.The Spider Man moment when she got caught in the tree was hilarious, as was the 'kiss cam' and the vibrator.OK, so it was funny, romantic, and funny. Recommended. In fact, it's a great date movie.",7,0,3,27 February 2010
Gangs of New York," The appearance of law must be upheld, especially when it's being broken.
","It was nominated for practically everything in 2003: Best Picture; Best Actor in a Leading Role for Daniel Day-Lewis; Best Art Direction-Set Decoration; Best Cinematography; Best Costume Design; Best Director for Martin Scorsese; Best Editing; Best Music, Original Song for the song 'The Hands That Built America'; Best Sound; and Best Writing, Original Screenplay. It won nothing. Sure, it won a Golden Globe for Scorcese and U2, and 31 other awards at other ceremonies, but it had the unfortunate luck to come out in a year of great films: The Pianist, Almodóvar 's Hable con ella, Road to Perdition, of course, Chicago, and even Eminem beat out U2.That doesn't diminish a great story, it just makes it hard to see amongst all the other stars out there in the sky.Besides Daniel Day-Lewis, I enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz in their roles, and I always enjoy Liam Neeson.Kudos also to Jim Broadbent and John C. Reilly.",8,0,2,24 May 2007
Windtalkers," John Woo's World War Two
","John Woo (The Killer, Hard Boiled) has finally made 'A John Woo Movie' in Hollywood. Finally, hyper-kinetic action and overwrought crises of friendship and conscience in a Hollywood movie.Nicolas Cage's Sergeant Enders has a Navajo code talker to protect and kill, if necessary. Cage's vet is bitter, ferocious and merciless and some of the violence is truly sickening. Just as it should be.The Marines are not perfect. Some are damaged, one is racist, and there is friendly fire.Adam Beach (Flags of Our Fathers) does a good job as Private Ben Yahzee, the code-talker Enders has to protect.Absolutely superlative stunt work.",7,3,6,29 June 2007
True Romance," I'm not what they call Florida White Trash!
","Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette make an outstanding couple in this film that had enough stars for several summer hits.Directed by Tony Scott and written by Quenton Tarantino, you know there was going to be explosive action, too.I couldn't even recognize Gary Oldman, but he got all nasty over Slater - 'He must have thought it was White Boy Day.' He never expected what Slater had in mind. And, guess what? Her clothes were not in the bag he took! I always like seeing Dennis Hopper. he just makes a movie more interesting. I'm sure he didn't want to meet Christopher Walken. He brought James Gandolfini with him - a formidable pair. He shouldn't have told that story about the Moors and my people. Gandofini did OK with Hopper, but he should have never messed with Arquette.Wow! Bronson Pinchot, Michael Rapaport, Brad Pitt and Saul Rubinek, too.What an ending!!!! A magnificent script and a soundtrack to die for.",8,2,2,12 June 2009
Gladiator," Djimon Hounsou Film Festival #2
","This film won 5 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russel Crowe. To me, this is the film that defines Russel Crowe, much the way I believe Mel Gibson is defined by Braveheart. It had another 45 wins out of 75 nominations. It was obviously considered by many to be one of the most outstanding films of all time.I would not repeat the description which is known by almost everyone, but say that I though Crowe was magnificent. I also thought that Djimon Hounsou established his cred as an actor for his role in this film. The supporting cast was outstanding and really added to my enjoyment.Director Ridley Scott never let the film lag. The action was continuous and exciting. They just don't make movies like this very often.",9,1,3,25 March 2007
Contact," Come on! lt's like you're saying that science killed God. What if science simply revealed that He never existed in the first place?
","We a just a small insignificant planet, in an ordinary solar system, in an ordinary galaxy, in an average part of the universe. Carl Sagan's novel reminds us of that fact and that we are insignificant without each other. Unfortunately, I would guess that 95% of the people watch this film would not grasp that and would continue to believe in what has been programmed into them from birth.It would be so easy to focus on the religious nut cases like Richard Rank (Rob Lowe) and Joseph (Jake Busey); or the opportunists like Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) and Michael Kitz (James Woods); or the typical bureaucratic jerks that horn in on others work like David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt). However, they were just players on a stage where larger things were being explored.I consider this to be Jodie Foster's finest work; even better than the performances that won her her two Oscars. She is a commanding presence on the screen, and she dominated this film despite the efforts of others to push her aside.The incredible special effects and cinematography made this most enjoyable. I never tire of looking at Hubble photos, and admiring the majesty and beauty that exists in space. I never tire of this film and the promise of what could be.Thank you, Carl.",8,2,4,1 April 2008
Donnie Darko," I promise, that one day, everything's going to be better for you.
","If you idea of a good movie is to see teens discussing the sex lives of smurfs, then you will find something right up your alley here. Sadly, that is about one minute of this interesting film that defies description. Is it a supernatural thriller? A comedy? Irony? A coming-of-age movie? It is all of this and none of this.Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Proof) plays an emotionally disturbed (szichophrenic?) teen who talks to a weird rabbit that tells him the world will end in 28 days. What happens in that time is the stuff legends are made of.You will definitely not get this on the first viewing. Maybe, even after your 10th viewing, you will still be confused, but keep in mind, during this summer of endless sequels, that there has to be something that challenges you and makes you use your head for something more than placing a ball cap.There is great acting by a variety of favorites, and great lines throughout, but it is not about the actors or the lines. It's about you. Check it out.",9,6,12,20 May 2007
The Pursuit of Happyness," Where are we going?
",Will Smith gave an Oscar-nominated performance in this excellent film about a father's love and going after your dream. I doubt if anyone could possibly imagine the heartbreak and struggle the Chris Gardner went though unless you have been there yourself. The fact that is was based on the story of a real person made it all the more powerful.I cannot imaging anyone watching this and not feeling tears welling up as they saw the impossible odds that faced Chris and his raw determination to just keep going. he knew that there was happiness waiting for him as long as he continued the pursuit. Isn't that all we are promised - the pursuit of happiness? It is up to us to keep going and try to reach the goal.Thandie Newton also gave a great performance as his wife in a small and unheralded role.,8,0,0,21 October 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," My son, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.
","The effects, the sound, and John Williams music were all fantastic and dded immensely to the experience of seeing Harrison Ford and Sean Connery together in the final chapter of the Indiana Jones trilogy.After re-watching the three movies, I am now ready to see the next chapter and feel well prepared. Well, there is a documentary on the crystal skulls tonight, so I have that.It is a shame that Ford and Connery didn't make more movies together because there was a chemistry between them seldom seen in film. They really played well off each other and made this the best movie of the trilogy.Alison Doody was also good. I saw her in Taffin (with the brief nip slip), and she was really good here. Will have to look for more of her performances. John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott were great, as usual.It is always a pleasure to revisit this film.",8,0,1,18 May 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," You told me Jason Bourne was dead.
","I remember the time when the Bourne series came out. Like many men, I devoured every book that Robert Ludlum wrote. I wouldn't dare to compare the movie to the book, but the same sense of excitement is there.I revisit this film over and over because I love it. I love the story and I love Matt Damon in the role of Jason Bourne. Director Paul Greengrass (United 93) can build excitement like no other.The one disappointment I have is that we will no longer get to see Franka Potente. She is just fantastic in the role of Bourne's lover.Joan Allen, Brian Cox, and Julia Stiles are great and I look forward to their joining Matt in the next installment.",8,3,4,24 July 2007
Hustle & Flow," 'The Gentleman' makes a great film
","He was looking for a break in the mid-1980s when he made his own luck and got on The Cosby Show. He played lowlifes and sidekicks until he made an impression in Dead Presidents and The Best Man. This led to intense performances in Crash and Ray in 2004. In Hustle & Flow, he had a break-out performance as a two-bit pimp who wanted to be a rapper. The energy that Terrance Howard brought to this film was tight. He was back by great supporting performances by Anthony Anderson, Taryn Manning, Taraji P. Henson, and DJ Qualls. Howard just keeps getting better every time I see him. I am looking forward to seeing him again with Henson when I watch Four Brothers, and with Big Boi and André 3000 in Idlewild. Vanity Fair calls him 'The Gentlemen,' as they mark him among the fresh faces that rise above the current set of reigning stars. This will be Howard's year, and Hustle & Flow marks him as the man to watch.",8,1,3,22 February 2006
The Birds," I keep telling you, this isn't 'a few birds'! These are gulls, crows, swifts...!
","Classic Hitchcock that starts out as an interesting flirtation between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren in her first credited role. She really looked much more experience in this film that won her a Golden Globe.The film itself got an Oscar nomination for effects.Along with Taylor and Hedren, the film featured a fine Jessica Tandy, and Suzanne Pleshette, who was nominated for a Golden Globe the previous year for Most Promising Newcomer, even though she had been acting for six years and had almost 30 roles under her belt. Of course, she would go on to fame in 'The Bob Newhart Show.' And, of course, there was little Veronica Cartwright (Alien, 'The X-Files'), who played the daughter.Things got scary quickly and the special effects were amazing.",8,3,4,15 May 2009
Jurassic Park," The lack of humility before nature that's being displayed here, uh... staggers me.
","I remember this film as enjoyable, but for some reason I did not find it particularly worthy. I decided to take another look.The film is characterized by excellent performances from Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum.They are not the only ones that stand out. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as the grandchildren were also very good.The sound effects and the special effects were dazzling. They are worthy of the Oscars they won.Wayne Knight as the porcine son Dennis provided a lot of laughs.The second half of the film was amazing action that you couldn't tear your eyes away from.A great movie.",8,4,9,1 June 2010
Valkyrie," I'm a soldier, but in serving my country, I have betrayed my conscience.
","Tom Cruise played his part well and was an integral part of me liking this movie so much that I halted harvesting on Farmville.He was backed up by some superb performances by Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, Carice van Houten, Terence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard, among others.It was fascinating to see that the conspirators spoke openly of their plans with no worries that they would be betrayed. This is because the career officers knew the war was lost, and were trying to save Germany.There was little excitement as this was a serious matter and was conducted as such. The men played their parts well and we could share in their efforts to succeed.Excellent film.",8,2,4,24 September 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
","I am probably the only person in the world that has never watched The Simpsons. I thought that I might get a glimpse of what everyone was excited about by watching this movie. If this is what it's all about, then I haven't missed a thing.Some say that the earlier years were great satire. Well, maybe that is true, and there were a few satiric anti-corporate and anti-government bits in this film, but way too few to sit through the really stupid bits that are only funny to a Middle Schooler.My only exposure to the Simpsons before this bore, was looking at the x-rated cartoons on the Internet. I'll take them anytime.",2,6,13,9 July 2008
The Wizard of Oz," Just try and stay out of my way. Just try! I'll get you, my pretty and your little dog too!
","The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is going back to 10 nominations for Best Picture next year. They had that in 1939, and I am sure that is the only way this film got a nomination. It's a great film, but not in the same league as the winner, Gone With the Wind, and even runners-up like Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka, Stagecoach, or Wuthering Heights.It did, however, win two Oscars for the music. To hear Judy Garland sing 'Over the Rainbow' is worth the time spent. I love that song, and can never hear it enough.It is a colorful, exciting fantasy trip with great music and some fine actors.",8,3,5,3 October 2009
Evil Dead II," Swallow this!
","OK, let's get the superlatives out of the way.Sam Raimi did an outstanding job keeping this movie moving along. There was never a dull second.Mark Shostrom, who did makeup for The X Files and Buffy, the Vampire Slayer, was incredible here.The special effects by Vern Hyde, Doug Beswick, and Tom Sullivan made this film. They were out of this world.Bruce Campbell was the man! I heard his name mentioned the other day, and I had to see who he was. He was so funny and well worth watching. He makes me want to find his other films, especially Evil Dead and Army of Darkness. This guy can act!",8,2,5,13 October 2007
High Fidelity," I'm too tired not to be with you.
","Up to this point, the best film that John Cusack has done, in my humble opinion, is gross Pointe Blank. It was a classic. This will be right up there with that film and I will watch it many times before I die.I could not imagine that Cusack and Jack Black could meld together and make a great movie, but they did. Black was just the right touch in the store. Now, don't get me wrong, I am not a music geek. I really don't care that much who wrote or performed a song. Music is just background. What I am saying is that you don't have to be a music geek to like a movie that takes place predominately in a record store.What was great was Cusack trying to figure out why he was a failure with women, especially Laura (Iben Hjejle). Hey, the guy lost Catherine Zeta-Jones. He needed to figure something out! It was funny, tender, and really worth my time.",8,0,1,10 November 2007
Up in the Air," How do you sleep at night, man?
","George Clooney was made for movies like this, or it that the other way around? Either way, he is perfect for the role, and deadpans his way through the film with incredible lines.He is very capably assisted in this effort by Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick.There are even some of my favorite actors in here: J.K. Simmons and Sam Elliott.It was a great story with a really depressing ending. His great goal was finally reached, but at what cost? He just didn't have anything connecting him to other people. No wonder he can do his job so well.",8,1,3,10 March 2010
Atonement," I love you. I'll wait for you. Come back. Come back to me.
","Once again the British get it right. Maybe there was just too many good films and good performances last year, but I like seeing this film get recognized not only as one of the best, but the performances of James McAvoy and Keira Knightley getting recognition also. Yes, Saoirse Ronan was great as a supporting actress, but I cannot understand how the Academy could ignore McAvoy and Knightley.Of course, the film would not be as good as it was were it not for the brilliant cinematography, the music, and the absolutely perfect sets, all under the brilliant direction of Joe Wright.This was an amazing romantic story with a twist at the end that knocked me out of my seat. It was just brilliant.I keep getting more and more impressed by Knightley and enjoy seeing her and her roles mature.",8,2,5,12 October 2008
V for Vendetta," What was done to me was monstrous.
","James McTeigue brought the skills he learned as an assistant director on such films as Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, The Matrix Reloaded, and The Matrix Revolutions to his first job as director in this film. He created a great film, written by the Wachowski brothers and starring Natalie Portman of the Latest Star Wars trilogy and Hugo Weaving of Matrix and Lord of the Rings fame.The action and visual effects were stupendous. Stephen Rea (The Crying Gasme) was great as the inspector trying to find V, and John Hurt (The Elephant man, Midnight Express) was eerie as the man you loved to hate.It was more than action and visual effects. It was a reminder of what fear can do and the ultimate consequences. Something we will hopefully learn in this country before it is too late, if it isn't already.",6,2,11,20 May 2007
The Island," Good popcorn movie
","Seems few agree that the Island is worth watching. It wasn't a classic, but it was a good popcorn movie. The first part was just another Jurassic park with human clones instead of dinos. Then comes the action part - and was there action! I do agree with some,however, that is did seem far-fetched that they could get it all together after their seclusion. Oh, well, watching Scarlett Johannsen is worth it any time. Djimon Hounsou was fantastic. I had not seen him since The Four Feathers. Ewan McGregor was also great and i hope to see more of him. Michale bay knows how to direct action movies and does not disappoint here.",7,0,1,24 March 2007
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Baptism! You two're just dumber'n a bag of hammers.
","This Oscar-nominated film is my favorite Coen-Brother's film after Fargo. George Clooney is just hilarious as the leader of misfit escapees.I had to put off cutting my grass just to see it again. Yes, I am still cutting grass the last week of November.The cinematography and music in this film is a delight in itself, but the characters are just a thrill to watch.John Goodman. a Coen Brother's favorite, Holly Hunter as the wife, Charles Durning as the Governor and his crazy crew, and, of course, Mia Tyler, Musetta Vander, and Christy Taylor as the Sirens.Baby Face Nelson, the KKK, and Mississippi politics all rolled into a fun movie.",8,1,1,25 November 2007
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Big Red... If you ain't chewin it... then f(beep) you!
","I have to admit that when I first started watching this film with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly I thought it was a documentary. The performances of the two stars was so spot on that they had to be the result of outstanding acting or perfect casting. I guess it is the fact that i am surrounded by legions of NASCAR fans that, like Ricky Bobby and Cal Naughton, Jr., can find some thrill in watching cars go 'round and 'round and 'round ad nausea for hours. It takes a special mentality, or lack of it, to appreciate this as some kind of sport and Ferrell and Reilly captured it perfectly. They even had the fan's cheer down: 'Please, Jesus, let her be 18!' However, the appearance of Sacha Baron Cohen as Jean Girard told me that this was just a spoof of NASCAR fans. There is no way these people would embrace a Frenchman. They can't even spell Formula One, much less describe it. And, a gay Frenchman at that! They would sooner give up their Budweiser.A real hoot!",7,0,2,25 December 2007
