The Blair Witch Project," Very realistic, hard to forget
","People say that the script of The Blair Witch Project was contrived and not clever, but this movie is incredibly realistic because it DOESN'T have all the usual witty Hollywood dialogue--this is what teenagers would *really* do and say in a situation that scares them.  The 'boring' scenes at the beginning only add to the tension and realism.  I wasn't as scared as I expected to be but I was *not* disappointed.  It's true you don't particularly like the characters, but that only seems to make them more realistic.Now this movie is permanently stamped into my mind.  I can not stop seeing over and over the last couple seconds.  I can't get that image out of my mind.  (Not a spoiler...you'll see what I mean when you see the film.)
As everyone has mentioned before, you will be more scared if you are imaginative because this film is mostly psychological and leaves it up to your imagination to figure out what's going on.  Probably not a good idea if you get motion sick (I didn't at all, but some people...) or if you like only gory, action packed horror films--or if you are going to be in the house alone for a while.I never knew *trees* could look so scary....P.S.  Make sure you also see The Sixth Sense; not as scary but a wonderful, wonderful film.",9,1,2,24 August 1999
