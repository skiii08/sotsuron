Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Quality
","I'm still in pain from laughing so much at this, it's just priceless. S-B-C has probably created his best work yet.The wide variety of people he picks on from ignorant subway riders to a mild-mannered rodeo manager allows for a constant bombardment of completely off the wall gags.The film is just long enough to keep the viewer interested (and probably to keep folk out of hospitals from locked jaws) without repeating itself.All in all, brilliant.And then, there's this scene where...nah, I won't spoil it. Go see it, you won't regret it! (well, unless humour skipped you by in the queue)",10,4,19,2 November 2006
