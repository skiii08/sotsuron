Raiders of the Lost Ark," Non Stop Adventure
","The one thing that i love about all the Indiana Jones films, is that adventure that gets you pumped and primed for more. But 'Raiders' sets the standard. As they say, the original and the best. Nothing has or will ever come close to 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK'. Why? because at every turn, a new sub-story or add-on is occuring. Sure, the action may stop for a while, but thats the beauty of it. It adds to the explanation of the story better, and progresses into an easy to understand plot line that you wished would have gone that much longer by the time you get into the car park. The characters are wonderfully cast and portrayed as Harrison Ford (will always be best known for this role, by far his best role in a movie), Denholm Elliot as his cheerful friend, who encourages him all the way, and Karen Allen as the eractic Marion, who loves to take this role out of control. Either way, 'Raiders of The Lost Ark' is a must see, if you havent seen it. If you have, then you'll agree with me, it will leave you hooked and will keep hounding until you watch it over and over againFantastic: 5'OUTOF'5",Null,0,0,13 January 2002
Batman Returns," Dark Satire, and good sequel to match.
","**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Batman Returns premiered three or so years after the acadamy award winning original (BATMAN 1989), of course, like all or most sequels, it turned out a little on the wrong side of the yard.Batman Returns is an interesting film, because, a lot of reviews compare it to its predecessor, and, i think that it is because of this, that this film got so much negative feedback.Its a new Gotham City, almost crime ridden, apart from a mysterious Penguin man of the sewer (Danny DeVito) and a new crime boss exec, Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Add to the mix a new on the scene good/bad/in the middle figure, Catwoman (Michelle Phiffier) and, of course, the Dark Knight (played again magnificently by Michael Keaton), and you have a seemlessly hit flick to rival it's original, or, even top it. Or so i thought...Once again, its good to look at visually. But once again, i was a little disappointed that Batman was again used as a support character for the two villains. It once again didnt explore that inner fuel of what makes Batman tick, and the story was a visual disaster, not much for the actors to work with.I cant believe that Daniel Waters wrote this script. What was he thinking. Penguin man who hides in the sewers? Drinks and spits vile, eats raw fish? Bites peoples noses? This character was a little to much Tim Burton, ala Edward Scizzorhands, and not like the comic book counter part, who is smug, posperous and a genuine criminal, Danny DeVito's portrayal was that of a monster, a hybrid.Catwoman, apart from Joker in the original, was actually done correctly, the only villain done correctly in my personal opinion.Overall, Batman Returns is a film on its own. Dark, Mysterious. Not Batman! No, Batman wasnt supposed to be like this. I havent seen it as many times as the original, but i still enjoy viewing it for its originality, but like all sequels, it was a little case of 'too big a budget, too big a flop'. Its a little disapointing, a little sad, and ultimatly, the end of Michael Keaton's reign of being Batman (The best Bat of all?)If you havent already, catch Batman Returns, but remember, its dark, has dark hidden jokes, and isnt the way Batman is supposed to be portrayed. Overall...***OUTOF*****Enjoyable",8,0,1,12 November 2002
Independence Day," America saves the world ... again
","'Independence Day' was one of those movies that you could sit back, relax and enjoy, instead of taking into account the plot, character development (which was easily done) and of course, the will of the human race to fight back. It starts off harmly enough, but then it is just plain - dull. But for those of you that enjoy action and cliff hanging films, this one is definitly for you. Good characters and one joke lines however, made this just another wanna be of the 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' - 'DIE HARD' - 'WAR OF THE WORLDS' genre. I do however, recommend you see it, as it does shape up well, after the first screening, but much better on the big screen. And to top it all off, another plot line of America saving the world. (How many times have we seen it?)3'OUT OF'5",Null,0,0,13 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Visually Stunning Cinema - The Best in the last 50 years!!
","**Contains Spoilers**An amazing and stunning fan-fare awaits you, that is, of course, if you havent seen this movie already!! The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers, will forever, be seen as one of the best, if not, the best sequel to a film ever made. It destroys its predesecor in all shapes and forms, not withstanding that 'The Fellowship of The Ring' isnt a top notch film in itself mind you.We are plunged straight back into Middle Earth's magical world of beautiful scenery, and amazing cliffs and ravines. Basically we see what becomes of Gandalf the Grey(perfectly executed once again by Ian McKellen), and how he destroys the balrog. We meet up with Aragon, Gimli and Legolas, as well as the returning Gandalf the White(rider) as they journey to the gates of Rohan, to rescue the aged King Theoden who is under the spell of Wormtounge (played absolutly magnificantly by Brad Douriff). Saving and healing the king, they ride to the safety of Helms Deep, or so they think, with the party from Rohan, and encounter one of the most stunning battles that will leave your heart pounding.Meanwhile, Frodo and Samwise continue on their quest, catching up with Smeagul Gollum, as he tries to steal back his 'precious'. An amazing transformation of CG and acting make me feel that Gollum will be revverred up there with characters the likes of Yoda. They jouney to the Gates o Mordor, only to run into more trouble with the people of Gondor....There are more storylines that intertwine in with the movie. It is too much to take in with one screening. It stay true to the book, however, it leaves some gaps. Peter Jackson has added elements that stray form the book, but are a positve thing for the movie, and add to the element of adventure.
The movie is stunning, visually and mentally, it leaves you wanting more!! I recommend this too anyone who is a fan of the books, tolkiens universes, or anyone out there who wants to be thrilled, The Lord Of The Rings : The Two Towers is destinied for an epic timelessness*****OUTOF*****Fantastic",10,0,0,30 December 2002
Total Recall," Great Action/Adventure. Thoughtful Filmaking
","**Contains Spoliers**'Total Recall's' thoughtfulness, good story telling, compelling twists and plots, action and adventure, not to mention a rolling/continuous storyline, backed up with wit, some humour, and Arnold Schwarzennegger, make Total Recall one of the est sci-fi movies to touch cinema in the last 50 years.Based on a short story by the 'master', Philip K. Dick, and adapted to fit the screen by Paul 'Robocop' Verhoven, 'Total Recall's' story, set in the 21st century, follows the story of Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) a construction worker, who continuously dreams and fanastizes of the planet Mars.When dreams become to much, Doug, against his wife (Sharon Stone) and his friends approval, pays a visit to Recall Corporation, whom have the ability to make dreams/fantasies, become reality. Choosing the Secret Agent option of his 'Virtual Vacation', Doug's dream becomes reality?However, something goes wrong, and Recall discover a neural implant, already placed there, discovering that Doug really is a secret agent, and they quickly erase all medical history, and send Doug on his way.
Suddenly, after twists and turns, Doug finds out that the truth to who he really is lies on Mars, and the adventure, for Doug, has begun.The screen story, some of which is identical to the short story 'We can remember it for you wholesale', by Phillip K. Dick, which is a tribute to his writing, and legacy. (He wrote short stories that inspired 'Blade Runner' and 'Minority Report'). While it differs heavily for the most part, its rolling storyline, combined with action/special effect scenes, really page homage to what the original short story tries to do.It also assembles a fine cast, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sharon Stone, and Michael Ironside (in his best performance from my view).If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, not neceesarily Star Trek, which this story has NO immediate/obvious story plots from the said series, and if you havent already, see Total Recall, and also check out its short story stalwart, 'We can remember for you wholesale'. You wont be dissapointed, and its the only chance to see Arnie in his most intriging role.Excellent*****OUTOF*****",Null,0,1,2 February 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Fanatastic Adventure story ~!
","One word that comes to mind after seeing this movie, adventure! I was 5 when i first saw this, and it really left me with a sense of adventure, and that Indiana Jones was a real treat. Today, i watch this movie, and feel that same sense of action, thrills and adrenaline that was pumped into the movie by director Steven Spielberg and writer George Lucas. The movies were based on Saturday Night Matinees from the 1920's, which was a plus. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are perfect, and, for those of you that didnt get the 500 year old knight part, he drank from the holy grail, and stayed there, because he didnt cross the seal, protecting the grail until someone took his place.Fantastic entertainment, only wish for another Indy film, here's hoping ****'outof'*****",8,1,1,7 January 2002
Back to the Future," I wanna be like Mike
","After i saw this movie, i really have enjoyed watching Michael J.Fox's productions and movies, he just had that cliche that was both entertaining and brought that extra 'oomph' into a film.An excellent story line was the trick here, The element of 'What if...'? It is everyones fanatasy to go back and see when their Mother and Father met, knowing that from that moment they were ment for each other. The element of romance, close calls, the ugly duckling nursery rhyme theme, comedy, suspense and that touch of drama were the ingredients that made Back To The Future a non-stop adrenaline ride. Though it takes it a while to get the started, its pace keeps hounding until the fimal scene. Excellent cast, stand out performance by Crispin Glover, and Lea Thompson, Michael J. Fox excellent as Marty McFly, and Christopher Lloyd as the excentric Doc Brown made this movie golden. If you havent seen it, do yourself a favor - go see it, you'll be glad you did, it will make you want to get Back to the future over and over again.A fantastic storyline and excellent direction, a dynamic cast.*****'OUTOF'*****Terrific",10,1,2,13 January 2002
