The Blair Witch Project," Go and see it anyway
","In my humble opinion this movie suffers in two respects because a) there's too much hype and b) to what film genre do you assign it?Forget about the hype and ask yourself a simple question.  Do you want to spend a few pounds/dollars watching a film probably unlike anything else you've seen? Be advised that it's not an 'in your face' film.  Be advised that, like my wife, you may be physically sick during/after watching it (simply due to the 'authentic' but shaky filming).It does not conform to the current label of horror.  Not one of your slash, cut, blood, spurt models.  Its not ghost or monster film either.It's a psychological journey with a twist.  The twist being 'we're pretty sure that ghost and ghouls don't exist and there's an explanation for everything........ well almost everything'.In commenting on this film most people have concentrated on the 'horror' element.  Equally thought provoking for me is the degeneration of the characters who are unable to cross the short but elusive bridge back to civilisation.As an avid and regular cinema goer what pleased me is that it isn't another Hollywood jukebox film.  You know what I'm mean!  What do I fancy tonight? Action?  Then choose option A1, A2, A3 or A4.  Comedy?  Choose B1, B2......This film is in the category 'None of the above'Watch, you may not like it but it is different.",6,0,1,3 November 1999
The Mummy," Not Indy, Not Horror but not a complete waste of time
","Firstly, remember this is aimed at 12 year olds and above.  This is dangerous middle ground when trying to be an action/horror/comedy film.You may end feeling you've had a chocolate milkshake without the chocolate!!!Know what you're going to see and expect nothing else.  Forget the hype, know the truth.Indiana Jones it ain't.  Horror it ain't. Comedy it might be if you can accept an odd mixture of hammy and serious acting.  Usual Hollywood middle of the road, lets rake in the money it definitely is.",4,0,1,1 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Disappointing but watchable
","Just goes to show that assembling a cast of well known actors under a (normally) good director does not always result in a good film.The sets, effects and atmosphere were wonderfully created but... It didn't engage you like 6th sense.  Gory yes.  Scary no.  Hammer House of Horror did it better.Shame, could have been a good film.",5,1,2,12 January 2000
Toy Story 2," One of the Best
",Why are you reading this?Go and see it either with or without your or someone else's kidsA delightful and very funny film.  I'm still crying (with laughter).,10,0,1,13 February 2000
The Sixth Sense," Just go see it
",If Haley Joel Osment doesn't get an OSCAR then there's no justice.If a movie can be judged by the audience reaction during showing then this must be a classic.  Deathly quietness a times. Sharp intakes of breath at others.  Even a scream or two.For my own part I must apologise to my immediate nieghbours for saying 'f*$Â£' a little too loud at the end when the penny dropped.Best film of '99.  Matrix was good but this was better.,10,0,0,6 January 2000
The Matrix," Not perfect but still a good view - Best film I've seen this year
","I'll not waste your time repeating the storyline but here are a few pointers.Excellent film making.  At times gothic, a touch of Hitchcock here, a bit of Star Trek, B5, TRON, it's all there.  Even the basic concept and several aspects of the overall theme are borrowed.  Acting is, in the main, good although Reeves is weak but...........It doesn't matter !!!!!  Go with an open mind and see this film. Forget about Star Wars its mindless, childish pap.",9,0,0,24 June 1999
