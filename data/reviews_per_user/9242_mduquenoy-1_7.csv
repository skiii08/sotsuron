Hereditary," 'Unspeakably terrifying'? Unspeakably dreadful
","What a waste of time his was. 
I was totally bought into it being deep rooted psychosis, that would've been interesting but as soon as the supernatural came into the fray it became ridiculous. 
Half the audience was laughing towards the end. 
Couple of spooks along the way but it's laughable.
Two stars purely for Collette's prowess.",2,1,3,19 June 2018
Aquaman," Nowhere near as good as they're making out
","First off Nicole Kidman is truly rubbish. Painful to watch. The costume we see her in at the end made me laugh out loud.
Secondly, you have to suspend your disbelief with all superhero movies but this one just takes it too far.
And try as they may, DC can't for the life of them get the same balance of action, rounded characters and humour that Marvel has mastered.",4,1,3,14 April 2019
Suicide Squad," So much to say about this film but not at all worth the effort
","This is an appalling film.
Jared Leto is awful. Truly the worst 2-dimensional performance. And all the more painful to watch when he's doing 'Oooh I'm crrraaaazzzyyyyyy' Nothing short of embarrassing. Please, never put him in those metal teeth again.
The Aussie delivers every single line in a mumble. He's lost and his part is completely forgettable. Oh and his weapon of choice is a metal boomerang (?!??)
No idea what Harley Quinn is doing. She's just a bit mental which surely isn't good enough to be a part of a 'superhero' hit squad.
Will Smith is brilliant - he goes along literally as Will Smith being dumbfounded by what's going on around him.Really uninteresting characters and you don't care what happens to them.",1,1,2,10 May 2019
Suicide Squad," Would like to change my review
",Gave it one star but would like to officially give it -3 stars if possible please.It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. How on earth it made $750m I will never know.,1,0,2,10 May 2019
A Quiet Place," Absolutely brilliant
",Loved this film. Simple as that. Properly jumped too,9,2,3,15 April 2018
Casino Royale," Pft it was alright
","Watched it again just now and it's a bit pants. I really like the gritty, realistic Bond and the action is gripping but I don't buy much of it. Le Chiffre would have just killed him. Bond's really the greatest poker player in the world? There were no leads at the end and yet he turns on his mobile and the answer pops up right there? Seems they realised the film was 2.20 hrs and simply had to end it.
They filmed some decent action sequences and appeared to make up a story around them.",6,5,9,4 September 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Acting
","If you've never seen Samuel L Jackson act then take a poke at this little beauty. He does a lisp. I mean, it's a joy to witness someone at the top of their game demonstrate their craft in such a compelling way. Watch and learn people.
Not casting him in this movie would literally raise its average rating by a clear 3 stars.",7,1,1,12 March 2020
