The Blair Witch Project," Not much production money can be a curse
","...or a blessing. The movie had the strength of a good short story - everything in it was dedicated to achieving the emotional response at its conclusion. Nothing gratuitous in the way of overdone special effects, over-blown casting, or over-heated sex. All that was in the movie, was what was needed to get the job done: to scare the bejebbers out of us. I wonder if that would have been the case if the movie makers had been cursed with more production money?",Null,0,2,14 August 1999
The Princess Bride," The Princess Bride as a Litmus Test
","I sometimes ask people I know what they think of the 'Princess Bride.' Most say it was a great movie. Many say they could watch it on TV over-and-over. Some say their kids had seen it on TV reruns,and the kids liked it top-to-bottom - but they hadn't seen it. Some said it was a kids movie. Some said that they watched a little of it and turned to another program. Most did not see it on the big screen but cought it on TV. I hang with them if they loved it top-to-bottom, even better if they could quote some of the dialog. I hang with them if they hadn't seen it, or, even better, if their kids had seeen it (apple doesn't drop far from the tree). However, if they had the chance, then tuned it off, I drop them. They are twisted and dangerous people. If they say they saw it, but it is a kid's movie, I pity them: they have pudding heads and unformed hearts.",10,1,2,28 November 2007
Million Dollar Baby," god's tears
","Frankie went to mass every day for twenty-three years because of guilt he felt about Scrap's lost eye and an undisclosed wrong of his that led his daughter to disown him. Finally, god heard Frankie's plaint and shed a tear for Frankie in the form of Maggie, a muscular bundle of desire and single-minded devotion. Maggie reanimated Frankie. In their short, intense relationship she gave him everything he had lost: a daughter's love, a desire to win (not just to train) and the opportunity to open his heart to her and shed his guilt. At the end, I was not sure that the movie was more of a moving love story or a dark, deep-felt tragedy, just as I am not sure if lemon meringue pie is sweet to the tooth or sour on the tongue. Or both...",10,7,9,17 February 2005
Reservoir Dogs," Bad Doggies...
","This is a late entry. In short, I agree that it was a great movie with memorable dialog, better than could be expected visually stimulating scenes, and top-of-their-game actors, especially Michael Madsen and Tim Roth. The ear scene was superb: Michael Madsen dancing and cutting off the cop's ear with the physicality of an oral surgeon pulling a tooth, the cops laments, the unexpected killing shots from Mr. Orange... But the use of the word 'nigger' and 'jew,' jarred unexpectedly. Oh well... For some reason this movie reminds me of an older movie, 'Straight Time' starring Dustin Hoffman, except that 'Straight Time' was humorless. Go figure...",Null,0,1,15 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," Slow...very...very..slow
","My wife and I saw this one together. I fell asleep about twenty minutes into it. I would have fallen asleep sooner, but I wanted to eat my fair share of our buttered popcorn. A few minutes before the end of the movie my wife woke me up with her scream, her fright spasm and a hurtful arm grab. At the end of the movie I thanked her for waking me because there were two more real scary scenes and a suprise twist of an ending. So. To summarize. Of the three segments of a movie: the beginning, the middle and the ending; this one had a real good ending.",Null,0,0,26 August 1999
