Miracle," A good movie, but there are some drawbacks
","The movie is very entertaining and the actors are good. The story and some comments are quite naive, but you must remember this is a movie of ice-hockey. I remember watching these games on TV, and there's something I must say:<ul><li>the peak of this movie is the USA vs Soviet Union game, and as a Finn I must point out that USA still had Finland to beat in the last game - there was no material in the movie of the USA-Finland game, and it really was a tough game for both teams (Finland scored first, USA finally won 4-2, the third US goal (by McClanahan) was clearly scored offside</li></ul>USA deserved the Olympic gold, it was far and away the best team of the tournament.Hey movie makers! Make a movie of the 1960 Olympic hockey games, that would be something different!",7,0,0,7 April 2007
