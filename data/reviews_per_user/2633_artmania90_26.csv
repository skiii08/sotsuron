The Lobster," Might be the best movie of the year
","The Lobster is about as quirky as they come; a surreal deadpan depiction of some alternate universe or perhaps our future (I'm not sure which the filmmakers were leaning towards) in which partnership is a legal requirement and to be alone is to be a lesser being. It's a story billed as dystopian, but with the complexity and sophistication that this civilization is run, perhaps our heroes who work to fight the system are merely traitors.The opening scene depicts a woman driving down a country road and then exiting her car to calmly shoot and kill a donkey in a field. Having completed this movie, one wonders what this donkey could have possibly done done to deserve it. We learn the processes and meanings later. In the simplest description, this is a society in which people who are single (whether due to death or divorce) must refuge in a sort of resort for loners, a large hotel in which newly-single folk must meet like-minded people in order to mate and return to society. Assuming you can't find a companion within 30 days of arriving, you are turned into an animal of your choice and released into the wild, forever doomed to be mute and alone.David is our protagonist (a deadpan Colin Farrell, he's fantastic) who enters the resort with his brother (a yappy dog, transformed by the same resort 4 years prior) after his wife leaves him for another man with glasses. He is given a single room, 4 complete suits, shoes, and instructions to never use the volleyball or tennis courts. Those are reserved for couples. He eats all 3 meals at an individual table (curious since socialization is the key to meeting others), attends stiff formal dances catered by the building managers, and regularly goes in groups to the nearby woods to hunt loners who have escaped the grounds.The story indeed makes for one of the most unique pieces of cinema I have ever seen. The tone is that of a black comedy, and humor is found not in actions or situations, but rather the curious nature of these characters. They speak in a simple English, and there is a bleak sound to it. David speaks with a textbook-like vernacular. He never laughs, never yells, and seems content with living out his remainder as a human in relative peace.Not only do our characters require a mate, but they also must settle down with someone of a similar trait. A fellow exile picks a woman who frequently gets nosebleeds and insists that banging his head on the table to cause a drip from his nose will make them a perfect couple. Another unsuccessfully tries to find a woman with a similar lisp to his.One thing leads to another, and David escapes to join a band of loners in the nearby woods (the loners hunted every night). There he falls in love with a short-sighted woman (Rachel Weisz in one of her best roles). How curious that David is also short-sighted, and how deeply sad that these foresters forbid relationships as a form of rebellion to society.Yorgos Lanthimos is the director and co-writer, Greek in descent and with a decidedly European sensibility to his film. His work, while challenging, concludes on a note that will leave some audiences confused and others amazed by the simplicity of it. Along with 'Her,' here is another modern film that works to dissect love and relationships in a way that we have not yet seen before. There is much to discuss about the film, and there is even more to debate. It's one of the very best films this year.",10,1,4,1 February 2017
Ghost," One of those movies that ages poorly
","Well, i just got done watching this movie for the first time. in 2 years this movie will be 20 years old. that's scary.first of all, i have to say i did want to see this movie because of hearing how popular it was in its day... that was then. this is now.i'll be honest - i thought this movie was OK, on the better side of average - however there are two noticeable problems: the 'special' effects, and Patrick swayze.first of all - i haven't seen to many movies featuring swayze, but i guess luckily so. i thought his performance had one or two good moments - basically whenever he shared screen time with whoopi. overall, however, i was literally cringing. his reaction to his dead body, passing through a doctor's head, etc. all made me just frown in uncomfortableness. i think any actor could have given this character more life and reality behind it. the special effects... well... i know you'll say - 'you're being contradictory! you SAID this was made 20 years ago! don't be so judgmental!' OK - whatever... Jurassic Park came out like two years later - and those visual effects are still as amazing as ever! i think this movie gave very little time and effort in regards to the effects, therefore... they suck... why do we need to know or see that when you're a ghost and you pass through someone's head, you can somehow see all the tiny blood cells and veins inside?! unnecessary... pointless...i think the only redeeming part of this movie was whoopi Goldberg - who is a genius! i thought her performance 100% deserved her Oscar and am so proud that she won. the humor she instills in her character just breathes life into an otherwise dreadfully dull movie. i actually laughed out loud at one or two of whoopi's lines! ha ha!basically - GHOST was OK, definitely not Oscar-worthy at all (except whoopi!), not even deserving of all 5 of its nominations! overrated, dated, clich√©, white noise in terms of movies in general.******/********** (6/10) i don't recommend this title, unless you're a fan of whoopi and you're ready to sit through bland movie to see her...",5,0,5,19 April 2008
Deepwater Horizon," The best disaster movie ever made
","DEEPWATER HORIZON is about as good of a disaster movie as I think I have ever seen. Recounting the tragedy in 2010 in which an oiler rig caught fire and claimed the lives of 11 men on board, the movie follows the events in sequence as an ensemble cast brings to life one of the most horrific events I think I could ever imagine. Stuck in a fire is bad, but imagine being stuck in a fire 45 minutes from land, with the ocean 3 miles deep below you? That's terror.The movie is told from the perspective (mainly) of one man, Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), who is now regarded as a hero for his quick-thinking and rescue of several of the crew on board. We are introduced first to his family. His wife, a stunning Kate Hudson, and his whip-smart daughter who wants her dad to find a fossil at sea for bragging rights at school. Before Williams leaves at work, the daughter demonstrates the way an oil rig works using a can of soda and a metal straw. Like that scene in Titanic where a computer generation simulates the entire sinking of the ship so that the audience knows what to expect, so does this throwaway scene give us a rudimentary knowledge of the happenings on the rig later on. When they are talking about cement and pipes and negative pressure, we have less cause to question what is happening. It's brilliant filmmaking.On board, we meet the rest of the crew, captained by Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell), who argues constantly with the BP executives on board about cutting corners. The construction of the pipeline leading to the ocean's floor is already 43 days behind, and construction is abruptly finished to cut corners and save the multi-billion dollar company a little money. BP is, of course, the villain of this story since their actions led to the largest oil spill in US history. The face to the company is John Malkovich playing a conniving investor with a Cajun accent and knack for time saving. His dialogue with Russell is great, and we see the rival sides of two arguments: the crew is trying to work in the safest environment possible. BP wants the job done on schedule.The events on board play out in the course of 24 hours or so. We meet the workers on board, all chummy and casual with each other. They practice songs with each other, joke, work like friends... The atmosphere is that of comfort, and there is lots of clever writing in the way small talk turns into startling character development and the candor of speech places these characters so specifically in southern Louisiana.All the while we see bubbles slowly rising from the ocean floor, an omen of what is to come. When performing a standard 'negative pressure test' to gauge the strength of the newly-built pipe, a surge of pressure forces mud and natural gas to erupt into the Horizon with the force of a bomb. The facility fills with gas, and the overdrive of engines causes an explosion. In the darkness, we see massive amounts of black oil rise into the sky thousands of feet above the platform. With a spark, it is ignited... The entire ship is a floating firebomb.Luckily many survive, and the action once the flames start is less plot driven and more or less a fight to escape. With Mark Wahlberg's character, he is knocked unconscious in his bed chamber and must work through the darkness to find safely. Kurt Russell, caught in the explosion in the shower, is nearly blinded and impaled by shards of glass and metal. It's utter chaos.The most effective aspects of this film (and there are many) is the set piece of the Deepwater Horizon, itself. It has been called the most expensive movie set ever built, and watching the movie I would never have second-guessed that this was not a real rig that has been long weathered and worn. We learn it is not anchored to the oceanbed but rather a floating raft of sorts that uses propellers to center it constantly above the delicate pipeline bringing oil to the surface. Without propellers, the craft shifts off-centered, risking the pipe bursting and oil flowing freely into the ocean. In a moment of absolute startle, we are with the pilot in the control room when suddenly all power goes out. The silence is matched in terror by the instant knowledge of an oil spill unlike anything they had seen before and the dire need to regain power of the motors.This is surely an intense film, but it is matched equally with heart, which is an aspect I think many disaster movies gloss over in the end to create a cookie-cutter ending with a bow on top. Here, when the survivors are rescued and brought to safety they are not happy and cheering to be alive. Mike Williams breaks down on his hotel room floor and is unhinged by the horror he had just lived. Families become angry in an attempt to locate their son or daughter on board. Yes this is a true story, and the filmmakers respected the subject enough to give it a bit more weight that a typical blockbuster might have bestowed.It's hard to rate movies on a scale since it's purely objective and driven by emotion. Deepwater Horizon may not be a perfect movie, and it may have slight flaws, but the feeling of immersion into the story and the characters left me breathless from opening to the final credits. The visual effects add to the story and create images that I won't soon forget. The final moments brought a tear to my eye. From the movies I know are currently playing in theaters, this is the one movie I would want to go back to a second time.",9,0,2,16 January 2017
Passengers," Titanic in space... for dumb people
","The premise for PASSENGERS is a smart one, so are the actors. What if you awoke on a 120-year mission on a voyage to a new planet only 30 years in? With no chance to go back to sleep, you are a castaway amongst a sea of people who you will never meet. This turned out to be a movie of 'what-ifs,' with an ending that was so silly and left me moaning out of annoyance. So much could have been explored had the writers used half their brain.This is Morten Tyldum's first directorial work since 'The Imitation Game' which was a fine movie about code-breakers in WWII. Here is a movie that is more simple. Jim (Chris Pratt) is the unfortunate man who awakes far ahead of his colleagues. At first, he doesn't know what is happening. He comes out of cryo-sleep and follows the normal protocol and settles into his room aboard the spaceship. Were he to have awoke at the proper time, they would have had 4 months of life on board to adjust before heading to their new planet (an earth-like home that provides an escape from those wishing to leave their homes behind). Jim quickly sees the problem, alone on a ship with no one to talk to (besides a chatty robotic bartender who was clearly written to serve as a lazy plot device. Notice how none of the other robotic aids on board look remotely human). He explores the empty space and spends a year in isolation before even making contact with anyone.Here is where the trailer led us astray. I would argue that the trailer set up an entirely different movie, because the occurrences that lead Jim to meet Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence, what a coincidental name for an actual sleeping beauty) are morally gray and make our hero an altogether bad man. I don't want to spoil it, but the film is so silly that it seems like a waste if I don't. Jim falls in love with Aurora after walking by her in cryo- sleep. He reads about her, listens to her recordings. Faced with a future alone, he makes the choice to wake her up and essentially commit murder by denying her the chance to wake up with the others 100 years from now. No matter his actions, this is a corrupt action that (love story or not) turns Jim from lovable to villainous.Of course they fall in love, and as luck would have it another crew member is woken up (Lawrence Fishburne) who helps them realize that there is a fatal error on board that could lead to the destruction of the ship. Like the bartender (played by Michael Sheen mind you), here is another character that was lazily included and dumbs down the plot by turning the story into a clich√©d action flick. Yes, Aurora discovers that Jim woke her up, but in the end they still manage to say their 'I love you's' before heroically saving the 5,000 sleeping passengers on board and living out the rest of their lives in a Stockholm- syndrome lover extravaganza.The movie could have been interesting if it stuck with one character learning to live by himself. It also could have been interesting to see what would happen if Jim and Aurora managed to fall back to sleep and meet again 100 years from now. Would they still fall in love? I liked the idea but didn't care for the actual story. Lawrence and Pratt are fine actors, but even their chemistry can't save this sinking ship. One trailer declared that this was 'Titanic in the stars.' That's quite a statement. Maybe they were referring to the actual wreck and not the plot.",5,87,171,16 January 2017
Lion," One of the best of the year. A true tearjerker
","The holiday movie season continues to dazzle with LION, one of the most emotionally rendering movies I can remember. A story based on a real event that follows a lost boy reuniting with his mother, this is a film that exists purely on merit and a powerful combination of imagery and sound. It's like a Hollywood movie that's so unbelievable you can't believe could happen. It's magic.There are two distinct parts to the film, a front-half that follows our hero through the slums of western India. There is very little dialogue and the language we do hear is local dialect. Saroo (Dev Patel playing as the adult and the wonderful Sunny Pawar playing the child) lives in a small shack with his mother, brother, and younger sister. They work as laborers, lifting rocks and earning little to survive. At night Saroo volunteers to help his brother Guddu in earning more money. With little sleep and a crowded train station to navigate, Saroo is soon lost. The boy is stuck on a train for days, trapped with no idea where he is going or where his brother is. Once he manages to escape, he wanders the streets of Calcutta calling for his mom in a language that locals can't even comprehend. His story moves slowly, tragically, and we follow this small child disappear amongst a mass of crowds and commuters.It's a wonder he manages to escape, but fortune would find Saroo in an orphanage in the heart of the city. His story makes the local news, but with the memory of an 8 year old and little recollection of his town's name (he doesn't even know his mother's real name), he is doomed to exist as a lost boy nearly 1,000 miles separated from his home. Fortune would find him adopted by two Australians (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman) who fly Saroo to Tasmania and raise him with love. They adopt another boy from the same orphanage a year later, and immediately we see the mental disturbances that could be inflicted on these innocent children. How Saroo managed to grow up so normal is a wonder in itself.The last half of the movie follows adult Saroo (Dev Patel in a showy role that is at times a bit too flat but never fails to impress) as he slowly realizes these memories of his childhood. He meets a girl (Rooney Mara) while attending college who encourages him to try and trace down his mother using Google Earth and the few visual cues he recalls. Simple math puts his search area within 1,500 kilometers of Calcutta. Painstakingly, he searches the grainly online images of train station after train station.Here is where the movie develops into a more complex story, where Sue (Nicole Kidman in a heartbreaking role) admits her wishes to adopt, and how she has no regrets about never having children of her own. There is a scene spoken almost entirely in whispers where Sue tells Saroo all that she believes and hopes for her son. Saroo, in turn, finds new insight into this woman and the beautiful sacrifices his parents made for him. Saroo keeps his search hidden from his parents, fearful of what they may think and worried that it will all amount to nothing. As unbelievable a story as this is, we can identify with these worries and what it means to have guardians in our lives.I will admit that this movie packs a punch, and the last 45 minutes are filled with incredibly-written scenes one after the other. Saroo on the verge of giving up hope stumbles onto a familiar sight: a water tower near the train station he first disappeared. We know it's the same tower too, with winding stairs and a distinctive roof. He can retrace his steps down the rails, through the trees, and back to his village... Zooming in on a pixelated brown spot, at last he has found it: his home. This scene alone is so powerful with only the fuzzy Google images, a tight closeup on Patel's eyes, and the music. The film score by Volker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran deserves much praise through melancholy sounds created on the piano, unique themes and a perfect marriage to the story at hand.It shouldn't be a spoiler to learn that Saroo an his mother reunite in one of the most beautiful scenes one can imagine, an embrace that is earned so fully that I doubt there was a single dry-eye in the packed theater I saw it. Stuck with no tissue I was caught with tears streaming down my face in a scene of pure electricity. I tremble with the memories of this moment, amazed by the story and more so by the accomplishments of these filmmakers to achieve something so wonderful and heartwarming. I wept at the end titles, which revealed more facts about this story including insight from Saroo's birth mother who never moved from her town and never gave up hope of finding her son. We learn the meaning of the film's title 'Lion,' which had me puzzled until the screen went black and then gave the film an entirely new meaning.On merits alone this movie is a masterpiece. There isn't a dense plot with side stories and miscellaneous characters. This is a story of one boy who never gave up his search to find his mother. In a country of over 1 billion people, the odds were insurmountable. For this story to be told with so much craft should instantly put this on the top of your must-see movie list.",10,2,4,16 January 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," one of the best films ever made. period.
","peter jackson's fellowship of the ring is not just the greatest of the three lord of the rings movies - it could easily qualify as one of the greatest movies ever released so far.it is the only of the three to be on the afi's top 250 movie list (i believe 150, which is completely wrong!) not even the return of the king, with its tear-jerking finale and 11 Oscars can compare with this amazing spectacle.this film was cheated out of best picture in 2001 by a beautiful mind (which i absolutely love and also find to be a great movie) winning only four Oscars (visual effects, makeup, cinematography, original score) was one of the biggest letdowns of the academy yet.this film easily deserved best picture, director, costumes, art direction, supporting actor ( for wonderful ian mckellan), and editing, too.when i first saw this movie in the theaters, i had no prior knowledge to the story, and when frodo told sam 'i'm glad you're with me' and walked down the hill towards mordor, i was left with a huge sense of uneasiness. not only because they did not destroy the ring (which i fould out they would the next day), but that this was the most powerful film i had yet seen in my life (i was 11).all in all, an awesome achievement in movies - one of the crowning achievements in any category, be it acting, directing, or design, this film truly on top!",10,1,3,3 August 2007
Split," With any luck this tour-de-force will get Oscar buzz for McAvoy a year from now
","It shouldn't come as a surprise that M Night Shyamalan continues to make films. Regardless of critical opinion, he somehow manages to build an impressive box office draw no matter how unimpressive his films turn out to be. In 1999 when he debuted with 'The Sixth Sense' there were people who said he would be the next Steven Spielberg. Looking back at that idea, there have got to be some pretty significant people rolling over in their graves to think that such a comparison was ever made. Regardless of my thoughts, and regardless of past works, it must be said that 'Split,' as silly as it is, still works on many levels as an intriguing thriller.The movie begins with the kidnap of 3 girls (Haley Lu Richardson, Jessica Sula, and Anya Taylor-Joy) from a parking lot in broad daylight. When they wake up in a windowless room, they soon begin to see the danger of their situation. Not only are they being held by a man (James McAvoy) with vague intentions, but he displays one of many personalities; some helpful and some dangerous. The chances of escape are slim.Right away, we have a flawed concept. We identify the hero of the story, the shy girl named Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy, who also appeared in 'The Witch' earlier in the year). Through endless flashbacks we see her tortured childhood, scene after scene of a small girl and her deranged uncle. Shyamalan attempts to draw sympathy with Casey and leaves the other two girls as little more than props with no clear character or motivation. Why have 3 girls at all? Kevin, as we learn the real kidnapper's name is, is in constant communication with his psychiatrist Dr Karen Fletcher who treats his split-personality disorder as though she is diagnosing a witch in the 16th Century.There's a novelty that comes with the film and Kevin's personalities, and it's with a surprising amount of conviction that McAvoy pulls off a difficult task: making us believe him regardless of the silly script and silly words they speak. We learn he has 23 personalities (ranging from a sort of kinky nun named Patricia to a small boy named Hedwig) that come in and out and communicate to the kidnapped girls through locked door. Hedwig is a fan of Kanye West and is curious about kissing girls. Another personality named Dennis has obsessive-compulsive disorder and keeps a close eye on the cleanliness of the bathroom.Yes it's Shyamalan so there is a twist of sorts. Whether or not you buy the ending is up to you. It comes in the final moments of the movie as patrons of a diner watch the news and react to the idea of a man living with multiple personalities. In the theater I saw it, most people didn't understand what happened. I don't blame them. The twist requires an audience's prior knowledge and history of the director's films. It's a preposterous setup and makes little sense in the context of the film, and yet die-hard fans will say they are now excited to see what M Night Shyamalan does next. That's a twist in itself.I can only praise the film for McAvoy's performance, which is unbelievably clever and worked out. The movie overall is a rough cut of something that could have been much more effective, perhaps with a different director or a tighter screenplay. When we see McAvoy on screen, it's almost makes up for all the other issues. When he's absent, the story falls apart. If that's not great acting I don't know what is.",6,1,8,1 February 2017
Jackie," The only reason to go is for Natalie
","I feel compelled to begin making bets on this year's Oscar ceremony, particularly in the Best Actress race. In my mind's eye, there can't be a performance that will top Natalie Portman as Jackie Kennedy. It's calculated and convincing in a way that is undeniable. From looks to voice, what we see on screen is far and away Portman's crowning achievement. The buzz has been entirely around this performance, and having now seen the film, it's easy to understand that it's really a one-woman show.The story is told in flashbacks (as many historical films do) as an unnamed reporter (Billy Crudup) comes to meet with the elusive Jackie in the weeks after her husband's assassination and her relocation away from the White House. With a temperament that is already biased against publishers that have elaborated about her life to more closely resemble a tabloid, she negotiates the basis for their dialogue and what will and will not be included. Her voice is deep, calm, and her face never breaks from the reporter's eyes. This is not a happy meeting.'Jackie' is certainly a slow-paced story, focusing more on character than plot. Through flashbacks, we essentially see the breakdown within the First Family of the immediate aftermath of the shooting. There isn't an 'Oliver Stone-like' scene in which the assassination is played out in graphic detail, and in fact it is shown in barely a few seconds of terror. The story is on Jackie, her inner torments... There are many scenes of her and Bobby Kennedy (Peter Sarsgaard) speaking in private, debating on the ways to handle funeral arrangements. Jackie researches the funeral procession of Abraham Lincoln, a man who was remembered after his murder in the public's eye. With barely 2 years under his belt, there is worry that JFK will go down in history like James A Garfield or William McKinley, 2 presidents also assassinated and now forgotten.From 'Black Swan' and now to 'Jackie,' it's easy to recognize the growth and maturation of Natalie Portman the performer. This is a full role, full of nuance and fragility. Within the film, there are contrasting cuts to her famous television tour of the White House, illustrating the renovation and complete overhaul of the famous home's historical artifacts. Portman is never better than these scenes, not only capturing the walk and mannerisms of the famous First Lady, but also her weaknesses and fear of the public's perception of her. Her voice is airy and outwardly 'fake,' but as the film demonstrates, she was a well-researched woman with tact and brain power much beyond those around her. Another moment captures her washing the blood off her face just before Johnson is sworn in. The camera is so close that we can barely see both her eyes in frame. The grief that explodes off the screen is horrifying.Pablo Larrain, the director who makes his English-language film debut, frames the story as though a dream. Rarely is the camera locked down, and oftentimes we float along with Jackie through the halls of the White House as she realizes that this quite literally the end of one side of her life. Coupled with an almost-experimental film score that so perfectly pinpoints emotional cues, there is certainly skill at a production level that shouldn't be forgotten come Oscar season.Is the film great? I don't think so. This is a movie made almost exclusively to highlight the skills of our leading actress, pushing story, pace, and drama to the side. The ending itself slowly drags along, scene after scene, almost as though the director doesn't want to look away from such an amazing performance. I can hardly blame him. It analyzes a woman that is so famous throughout America and yet most people probably don't know the first thing about her. There is so much more to this woman than a blood-stained pink suit.",6,0,4,16 January 2017
Inside Out," The best movie of the 2010's
","As the decade rolls to a close I have been thinking about what was the greatest movie of the last 10 years. I remember movies like 'Boyhood' or 'Whiplash' or 'Roma' or 'Social Network' but in the end I can't stop thinking about INSIDE OUT, the crowning achievement of Pixar (a high bar considering they also made Wall-E). It's a beautiful story in the most simple ways, but tackles ideas that are so complex and intertwined that I'm amazed the filmmakers were able to so perfectly find a balance. It's Pixar's most heartbreaking (Bing-Bong, the climax with Sadness...) and probably their most universally relatable. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking this looked like the next total miss for the company... How wrong I was. This movie is a masterpiece.",10,0,0,24 March 2019
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A Beautifully-Shot Movie!!!!
","I just got done watching it - 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.' whew... the main reason i went out and rented it was simply because i had seen clips and heard that the cinematography was absolutely stunning. it IS!i'm sorry, but the real star of this film is roger deakins, who also directed the photography of the 'equally-beautiful-but-not-obviously-so' no country for old men. i think he is one of - if not the best cinematographer Hollywood has today! i am absolutely stunned at what an amazing eye he has! the scene that stole the whole movie for me though was the infamous 'train robbery' scene - where the ghostly white light of the train penetrates the darkness of the forest - revealing the masked robbers. the warm yellow smoke and lighting turns the scene into the most stunningly shot scene in the past 10 years. hands down. i am torn between this and 'there will be blood' - the Oscar winner... very tough...i also am AMAZED at how much talent the affleck family bestowed on Casey. his performance as Robert ford was so complete and breath-taking - i'm sure he would have won the Oscar had Javier bardem not taken his amazing role in 'no country for old men.' and brad Pitt - a star i hadn't thought too highly about until 'babel' is incredible as Jesse James. i am a bit surprised that he was absent from so many best actor lists... oh well - one day soon...AND THE MUSIC! technically this film is nearly perfect. i thought this was one of the most effective, moving, and beautiful scores of the year - in fact i think it could only be topped by the brilliant 'atonement' score. this should have DEFINITELY been nominated for best original score - i mean seriously - the 'michael Clayton' score is just a bunch of sounds - not music! wtf! if you're gonna honor James newton Howard at least nominate him for some GOOD music (hmmm - 'i am legend?') anyway - i am in the process of buying the main theme from the movie off of itunes. check it out! overall, i think the pace was just a HAIR too long, but not that much. the plot was a bit muddled and i found it hard to follow at times... i don't know about other people, but for some reason i had trouble remembering the names of characters aside from Jesse, bob, and his brother... that kinda messed me up a bit... i did watch it later in the night...so basically - i would definitely recommend this movie - if for nothing else that the shockingly beautiful cinematography and beautiful, lullaby-ish soundtrack. enjoy!*******/********** (7/10 stars)",9,1,4,15 April 2008
Transformers," wow - thank god for CGI
","first of all, i would just like to say this could very well be the WORST movie made in 2007. EVERYTHING (well, almost everything) was complete crap: the horrible - HORRIBLE script (ex- the extremely painful scene in the boy's bedroom, with topics ranging from masturbation to a random hot girl), shitty acting from EVERY actor!, the stupid celeb cameos which ended up detracting from the movie, etc...however, were it not for the BEAUTIFUL - GLORIOUS - STUNNING CGI visual effects, i would have given this movie a 1. sorry - it just didn't strike a chord in me - i'm honestly confused as to why it received such a high rating among fans!but back to the effects... i haven't seen the golden compass yet but its effects must have been a gift from god for them to have won the Oscar! (i'm sure they're not and i bet money transformers had better effects. i think the problem in the end is that the movie in general was so darn bad. at least the golden compass was a movie based on a popular book and didn't make everyone want to throw up in their seats)that's about all - i hope if you haven't seen the movie yet - you don't... unless you want to see one computer-generated miracle after the next",6,2,6,5 March 2008
Hidden Figures," Too much sugar-coating to get to the heart of the matter
","HIDDEN FIGURES follows the behind-the-scenes journey of NASA to put a man on the moon. With stiff competition between Russia and the thought of coming in second place in a two-way race, the need for success was palpable. We have seen movies following the journey of astronauts and the science wizards at NASA, but who would have guessed that even as man was shooting for the stars, employees at the head offices still had to use 'colored' and 'white' bathrooms?Theodore Melfi directs this picture which has the feel-good attitude of 'The Help,' a movie that was a box-office success and sugarcoated race relations in the 1960's. Heck, even Octavia Spencer appears in both films. I can't say for sure which film succeeds more at its objective. The story of black female mathematicians surely isn't one that many people had heard of, and perhaps that's where the film's title is rooted (although I would wager that 'Hidden Figures' is one of the year's worst titles...). It's a good story rooted in strong performances, but I found the overall result to be a wash of clich√©s and predictability.Three friends - Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary (Taraji Henson, Octavia Spencer, Janelle Monae respectively) carpool together to the offices of NASA where John Glenn is about to launch into space to become the first American to circle the globe via spaceship. How they are friends we are not sure, but their quick wits and strong minds surely bind them together. Our central character is Katherine, who is called in to assist with the top engineers on flight reentries and landings. Not only is she the only black woman working on these most important calculations, but she is the only woman aside from a secretary who watches her with distain. She reports to Al Harrison (Kevin Costner), built up to be a firm disciplinarian but develops into a man who only wants to see the job done, regardless of race or sex. At NASA, we learn that most of the black mathematicians work in a 'holding room' of sorts, arriving each morning and assigned as 'computers' on various tasks that could result in a couple hours work or a couple weeks... It's all based on assignment. Though they are all employed, the possibility of work is not always guaranteed.Like 'Apollo 13' did so brilliantly, suspense is built during moments when we know the outcome. Even though we know John Glenn makes it back to earth safely (and only just passed away this year), there are nail-biting moments of drama when the fate of success rests on a pencil, paper, and brains. Mary (Janelle Monae in the film's best performance) is assigned to work on the capsule and heat shield. Though she excels at math, she dreams of becoming an engineer (unheard of at the time. She became the first black female engineer in NASA history as the end credits tell us). She takes no slack and acts as any man in her position would: she is straight-forward and doesn't shy away from confrontation. Dorothy (Octavia Spencer) only wants to become a Supervisor and get an according pay raise, and along the way discovers her knack for computers and electronic programming.I admire the film and it's message, but even yet we suffer from clich√©. Whether or not Katherine Johnson was called in within 10 seconds of launch to recalculate a landing formula is beside the point. There are moments in this film where I found myself saying 'I've seen this before' and 'I bet I know what will happen next.' Ten times out of ten I was right. This isn't to discredit the stories of the real women, but rather dismiss the screenwriter for falling prey to conventionality. I highly doubt Dorothy Vaughan was able to sneak into the massive IBM Computer Room and reprogram the machine for weeks without being caught. I doubt the engineers at NASA were really so dumb as to put astronauts' lives at risk until the their math was proved wrong by the film's hero. For a film, it's exhilarating entertainment. Considering the real-life story was almost guaranteed to be less dramatic, we can cut our losses.I should expect Janelle Monae and perhaps Octavia Spencer to reel in the award nominations for their dedicated and memorable roles. I would consider Taraji P Henson if not for one scene that screams 'I want an Oscar' in which Katherine explodes about having to use a colored bathroom and face the scorn of her coworkers. Wide-eyed and full of rage, it's a powerful moment yet goes against everything we know this character to be. The film itself feels a lot like that: trying so hard to be an Oscar contender even by putting reality aside. There isn't a whole lot of depth given to these characters, and even less to the white engineers who essentially prove to be the villains (Jim Parsons gives a surprisingly monotone performance). For movies to touch on aspects of historical race relations, they must realize that it isn't all black and white.",7,2,7,16 January 2017
Black Hawk Down," a bit too much
","ridley Scott, director of the excellent 'gladiator' the previous year comes back with black hawk down, a war movie reminiscent of saving private Ryan.after finishing this movie, i thought it was not bad. Scott has crafted a vision of war unique to his own style but draws from many other sources. this movie, for me, was just too much. it seemed to be one long battle for the entirety of the movie, with no breaks whatsoever. of course, i realize that's probably how it played out in real life, yet i think that if that is the case, why turn it into a movie? the ending especially seemed to have tried to hard to redeem the rest of the movie for its lack of personal sense. those final moments and scenes, where the idea of war and fighting are discussed, and a fallen soldier is given a final goodbye, bring the movie to a good conclusion, yet seem to not fit with the rest of the film.i also thought as i watched this film how stupid (sorry) the whole movie seemed. they rushed into a dangerous war zone to find a few dead bodies and maybe one or two wounded at risk to the entire squad. why risk the lives of many, maybe hundreds, to save just one or two? sorry, but i really think that it was not worth it for the casualties they sustained in this battle.this movie, though, unlike saving private Ryan, stops not to examine each character individually. instead, they are revealed briefly in the bookend of the movie- either at the beginning or very end. saving private Ryan, on the other hand, begins with a bang and pulls us into the story, then pulls back and crafts the characters realistically and with time.all in all, a good film, though. recommendable, yet not one of my personal favorites.*******/********** (7/10)",7,0,2,29 July 2007
Silence," Will take some time to process
","There's a reasonable argument to say that SILENCE is one of Martin Scorsese's better movies. The talk is that it was a passion project of his for decades, finally being released in all it's artistic endeavors and mysteries. I suppose someone else could argue the opposite: that this is a story full of brutality and despair without the signature style of the aged director. I think I'm falling right on the middle on this one. This is surely one of the year's most powerful stories, and yet I have to admit it left me cold.The story follows two priests from Portugal (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) who venture into hostile Japanese country in search of their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who has abandoned his Christian faith. Some chalk it up to mere rumors. These two young ministers take the journey to find out for themselves.What begins as a fairly traditional story ventures into the heart of Japan in the 16th Century with a sharp attention to both detail and horror. This is less a story of a search for one man as it is an odyssey into the despair found in conflicting religious beliefs. Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) holds hope that Ferreira is alive while also working to convert as many locals under cover of darkness. Upon landing on the shores of Japan (smuggled in on small fishing boats from China), he encounters villages of faithful Christians who worship in secret. For them, the arrival of Rodrigues and Father Garupe (Driver) is confirmation of their beliefs. Through language barriers, it seems that God is always present.As we delve further into the country towards Nagasaki (where Ferreira is said to be held), the two priest break off on separate journeys. Rodrigues, though oftentimes alone, is shadowed by a Japanese recluse named Kichijiro, a drunk who once betrayed his faith in order to spare his life (he witnessed the execution of his entire family) but returns to the faith time again in order to make Confession and amends with the Lord. Rodrigues continues to absolve him, and yet this is the slow unraveling of an aspect of this story: do the Japanese really comprehend the religion in the same way Westerners do?There are three people who make this movie better than average: Andrew Garfield surely gives one of the year's best performances as a man trapped in his own personal Hell, forced to grapple between martyrdom and eternal damnation. It's a strong year for Garfield, getting accolades and Oscar buzz for his other leading role in 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Trust me, this is the better performance. Second is the skill of Martin Scorsese, who slowly paints a portrait of a time long forgot with such attention to tone. It's a horrifying and at times morbid story to sit through, but there was never a moment I found myself any less than fully-focused and contemplative.Third is a surprise, a breakthrough performance by a Japanese actor named Issey Ogata who gives without a doubt one of the year's most memorable performances. Throughout the film the Christians living in Japan are routinely inspected by samurai officials who intend to hunt down and capture any found citizens in violation of the law. One such official is Inoue Masashige (Ogata) who treats the job with a certain flair. Constantly waving a fan and with an ear to ear smile, this is a performance that steps above the rest of the cast by perfectly encapsulating the braggadocious nature of Japanese law without missing a beat. It's a winking devil performance that I hope the Oscars won't look over.'Silence' is at times hard to palpate and yet rewards the audience for it's patience. Whether or not this film can be interpreted as being pro or anti-Catholic is maybe not the ultimate message of this film. While the final act delves into a horrifyingly-dark arena, consider the final shot before the credits begin to role (I won't spoil it). In such a brutal era with antiquated customs, isn't there still hope left to be found?",8,79,132,16 January 2017
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," easily one of the best harry potter films yet!
","well, i just got back from the midnight showing, and overall i was very impressed.not with the c.g.i. work, though, which on the whole i found quite weak and unrealistic. i found the character developments from the past movies reach their fullest potential.the title character of harry potter was excellently acted by Radcliffe, and overall he has made the greatest improvements throughout the films.but what impressed me the most were the three new female roles: Bellatrix Lestrange, Dolores umbridge, and Loona Lovegood. each one was wonderfully cast and perfectly realized on film. and was anyone else strangely finding loona lovegood kinda hot? the only real drawback i had was the over use of filch throughout the movie. he is in no way funny and only detracts from the story every time we see his face for 'comic' relief.this movie could easily overcome my favorite h.p. film (prizoner of azkaban - with its wonderful direction by cuaron and beautiful cinematography by Michael seresin) simply because it creates a new look on the harry potter world. much more dark and sinister, the story is beautifully realized by fast editing that would make Christopher Columbus faint.and to all you people who find the editing out of certain scenes from the book dumb, think about this: it is not necessary that we see gilderoy Lockhart in st. mungo's or that Reeta skeeter got her interview with harry (too bad, though) the story functions perfectly fine without it! overall a great summer movie, not Oscar caliber in any sense (the closest i can come to see is best supporting actress by umbridge (unlikely)) go and see it - its worth it!!",8,0,0,12 July 2007
La La Land," Not the masterpiece everyone is making it out to be
","'La La Land' is above all an experiment in filmmaking just as 'The Artist' was: to see if modern audiences can accept a bygone style of movies in today's world. It's exciting to see that it works (based on the box office success of 'La La' and the surge of Oscars for 'Artist'). There are no cheats, there are no plot twists or modern devices to twist the audience's arm. This is a musical that is unapologetically saccharine and delivers as a crowning achievement of the year, even if it doesn't always live up to the insurmountable hype behind it.This is Damien Chazelle's second major feature as writer/ director after his unbelievable debut with 'Whiplash' (winner of 3 Oscars and maybe the best movie I've seen since beginning reviews for this website). The buzz behind this film was undeniable, and I know the pressure on Chazelle was great. In an industry of remakes and reboots galore, and despite my few issues with the film, I still think he is a filmmaker above all else. As Oliver Stone so perfectly described it: 'I have seen the future of filmmaking and his name is Damien Chazelle.'La La Land is the romanticism of Los Angeles and Hollywood, and the story is aptly simple. Two people try to make a name for themselves amidst rejections galore. Mia (Emma Stone) likens herself as a great actress and yet can't get out of her part time job as a barista. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) has a dream of opening a jazz club and reinvigorating the musical scene in the city. Through fate and circumstance these two run into each other more often than one might expect, and as luck would have it they fall in love.As grand of a scope as the film is, it's essentially about these two people and the connection they share. SAG notably 'snubbed' the movie of an ensemble nomination, but thinking back on the story I can't even recall the side characters who occasionally dropped in. Both Stone and Gosling carry the film with humor and charm, a throwback to the simple storytelling of classic MGM musicals, and they sing to boot (live on set, too).Yes, this is a musical. Not a gritty reboot of the genre as 'Moulin Rouge!' was, or one driven by sex and jazz like 'Chicago,' or an adaptation of Broadway like 'Les Mis.' This is a pure, original story with original music in all its candy-color CinemaScope shots and costumes. I can't think of a movie quite like it, so creative and risky to fund. It's like 'Singin In The Rain' or 'American in Paris' and has the tone of those movies, too. The musical numbers themselves are each filmed in one long take (a popular trend after movies like 'Birdman') and are mesmerizing to watch. The opening song has a moving camera across a busy highway complete with traffic. How they filmed it I will never know. Another song shows Mia and Sebastian tap dancing over a cityscape as the sun is about to set. I would have to assume it's computer generated but would believe otherwise- I'm sure they had no more than 5 minutes to film the entire scene before losing light.There are a lot of themes at work, and a lot of the same ideas that 'Whiplash' previously explored: jazz, dreams, failure... the two films, as different to ally as they are, work to compliment each other and are the beginnings of a repertoire that only could be described as 'Chazelle-ian.' The movie isn't all fun and games, and the final 20 minutes are full of deep melancholy and regret. I admired the film all the more for its conclusion, but still felt the ever-present fact that in following the style of a classic MGM musical, it's very predictable. I loved 'Whiplash' for its unique voice and style. The style is still there, but there's only so much a script can do that is bound by rules and guidelines. The final exchange of glances between Mia and Sebastian and the last moments of the film are most certainly a reference to the finale of 'Casablanca.' Even if the ending isn't what we had hoped, their look says it all. 'We'll always have Paris.'Go see this film if only because there is nothing else like it. I doubt anything will ever come out again like it. Go for the filmmaking and admire the year's best cinematography (a scene in a movie theater in which Emma Stone is illuminated by projection light is unquestionably beautiful, and the recreations of the green silhouette from 'Vertigo' is jaw- dropping and unexpected). If you are looking for the year's best movie I don't know if this is it. Regardless, it's damn good.",8,4,10,16 January 2017
Snowden," An apt biopic
","Oliver Stone's SNOWDEN does exactly what a film about a whistleblower must do in order to be an effective thriller: sets up the story, sets up the motivation, and presents an opinion of the subject. It's still a fairly hot-topic situation, as Snowden's massive leak to the press regarding NSA surveillance only happened a few years ago. Though the film has a few flaws that surely hamper it's overall effectiveness, the general thought presented is that 'Ed' Snowden is our generation's Karen Silkwood; a hero of unlikely background.The film is structured in a sort of flashback, with Snowden's initial leak to the press in a small Tokyo hotel room lending itself to flashbacks of his life to this point. It's hard to imagine most people not knowing who Edward Snowden is at this point, especially considering a documentary surrounding his espionage just won an Oscar not 1 year ago. The film seeks instead to provide a backstory and shade the infamous man in a more human light - painting a portrait of what would lead a patriot to betray his beloved country.Joseph Gordon Levitt, I'll admit, has felt miscast in the past. He falls into roles greater than himself and fails to disappear into the character we see on screen. Surprisingly in 'Snowden,' he actually succeeds. Deepened voice, loose-fitting clothes, and the slightest stubble, Levitt all but transforms in the role (all the more compelling when the film concludes with footage of the actual man and we barely notice that it is a new person). It's hard to classify his performance as someone who is sympathetic, but overall he does an effective job playing a man who finds himself in between a rock and hard place - that is to say the internal struggle he faces seems genuine.The backstory we follow finds Snowden meeting his long-time girlfriend, first seeing her chat on an online dating site while in military training, and finally meeting in Washington after he begins working for the CIA. Played by Shailene Woodley, the girlfriend role oftentimes falls into the category of 'emotional obstacle' and in several scenes she and Snowden fight only to keep the story juicy and the plot flowing. While good in the past (The Descendants, The Fault In Our Stars) Woodley is given very little to do in this film and tries her hardest to make the role her own.I was very much impressed with the front-half of this picture, and I found the setup and introduction to our characters to be very effective. Snowden is initially hired on to work for the CIA and has some great scenes getting to know his supervisors and teachers (one of which is Nicholas Cage in a curiously-small role). We learn about who he is, how smart he is, and how his early work with the government would ultimately shape his story. It's too bad that the rest of the film fails to match the energy. Overly-clanky with flashbacks and flashforwards, it becomes fairly tedious to journey back and forth between present- day Tokyo to Hawaii or Europe or any variety of places in the States. Oliver Stone (co- screenwriter) had a lot of material to sort through, but it seems like the structure of the story was flawed slightly along the way.I still praise the film, with it's strong leading performance and intriguing (albeit biased) account of this decade's most notorious government leak. Yes, the film makes it clear that Edward Snowden should be regarded as a saint - someone who uncovered mass conspiracy within our government and worked only to protect the USA's citizens. The movie serves as a supplement to the real man, and perhaps can help in forming opinions of whether or not his actions were ethical. Though Oliver Stone has made better films in the past, 'Snowden' is still an effective biopic that warrants a viewing.",7,2,4,1 February 2017
Don't Breathe," Has one of the all-time great horror movie scenes
","It's rare for a movie to have me on the edge of my seat, genuinely curious as to what will happen next. In a genre where clich√©s are now the running gag, to make a film that is full of original ideas and creativity is a relief to say the least. I had heard a lot about 'Don't Breathe' mainly through word of mouth, so I decided to finally see it without having so much as read a brief synopsis. I was skeptical about how a movie like this could sustain itself for a feature runtime. I was pleasantly surprised by how effective it is.The movie borrows major ideas and elements from some of cinema's best thrillers, and I mostly recalled 'Panic Room' and 'Wait Until Dark' as antithesis versions. The plot is almost laughably simple: 3 small-time burglars are hoping to strike it big when they hear a retired war veteran has won a settlement over the death of his daughter for upwards of $300 million. They assume the cash might be in his house, and even better is that they realize he has gone blind. These are barely kids in their 20's. Alex (the logical one of the group) uses his dad's spare keys from his security companies to disarm these homes, quietly loot various goods, and rearm the home and stage a fake robbery. Money, the wild one, is head-to-toe tattoos and carries a gun even though this could lead to a longer jail sentence should they be caught. Rocky, the heroine, sees the money as an opportunity to relocate her and her daughter to a better life. The plan is so simple.The director, Fede Alvarez, is known for making 'Evil Dead' in 2003, but this is a clear exercise in tone and suspense. With each new moment, he adds a new layer to the dread, and the camera floats through the house to remind us where spare guns are hiding, which windows have bars... It's a technique that someone like Alfred Hitchcock might appreciate: showing the audience more than the characters know. When they first enter the man's home, there is a steady shot of a hammer hanging on a rack of tools. Nothing becomes of it, but our minds begin racing with ideas of how this will come into play or what it might be used for. Later, we see a spare gun strapped to the underside of a bed. Only the audience knows what dangers are in store.I won't spoil too much more of the film, only to say that the robbers' tour of the home lead to nearly every room of the home and some in between. A dark discovery in the basement finds them trapped with the blind man amongst rows and rows of shelving units, and as casually as he begins hunting them, he turns the fuse box over and leaves them in utter darkness. This scene (about midway through the film) harkened back to the chilling climax of 'Silence of the Lambs' and yet raises the stakes tenfold from what Clarice Starling encountered with Buffalo Bill. We know his basement can only be so big, and we see the man wandering through the darkness touching familiar landmarks to remind himself the path he needs to take. Both Alex and Rocky are blind, shaking, barely moving forward. The scene is photographed in a smoky black & white, and the quiet breathes of the victims move in and out of earshot. Rocky moves down a hall, at the end of which slowly materializes the blind man, quietly waiting.. Listening. It's without a doubt one of the most effective horror scenes I have ever seen and the crowning achievement of the film.The film finally sees it's own form of climax, and for me this is where it began to drag. From the old man's dog (a vicious Rottweiler with an apparent taste for human flesh) to chases back and forth inside and outside the home, I have to admit the finale of the movie became an exhausting chore to keep up with. There were many moments when it felt like the story was coming to an end, and the 'shocking' moments were realizing that it was still going. This movie requires a great suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy (the logics of this movie have to be taken with a grain of salt or I would guess one's appreciation might be somewhat lessened), and with each new 'twist' I felt the movie losing it's claustrophobic feel and moving more towards a standard slasher flick with it's own set of rules and horror clich√©s.Regardless, I will honestly admit this was a very fun film to experience in a theater. The photography is closed in and haunting, and the performance by Stephen Lang as the blind man is sure to become a classic in the vaults of iconic horror villains. For a movie with such a simple idea as a robbery gone wrong, boy did they get it so right. I only wish they would have pushed it further instead of drifting back to the standards a typical Hollywood revenge flick might take.",8,2,6,1 February 2017
The Witch," Quintessential 21st Century Horror
","The Witch (VVitch) is one goddamned scary movie, and it's not because of cheap thrills and jump-cuts galore. This is a movie that buries itself deep into your psyche, slowly builds up as a monster movie as well as something along the lines of a psychological thriller. In an era when it seems like horror has little more to contribute, here comes a movie that packs a punch comparable to great modern films like The Babadook.It's an undated time when America is barely colonized. A small family is banished from the city for religious betrayal or some such thing. It's hard to know for sure especially as the opening shot is of the magistrates of the town sentencing the family to leave at once. We see the reactions of the father's children. They are young, confused, willing to follow their parents and yet unsure of what the implications are. With little more than a wagon loaded, the family departs and sets up a small farm on the edge of a dark forest. Al is well.If you have seen the trailer, you know the general feel of the film. What surprised me was how quickly the film jumped into the thick of the terror, as the infant baby is kidnapped before their oldest daughter's eyes. Perhaps it was a wolf, and through frantic searches, they give up hope as the baby is known to be dead by either animals or hunger. The next- youngest, a set of twins who playfully run throughout the farm, claim to know stories of 'the witch of the wood.' It's laughed off.When I recall to mind great horror movies, I think of moments that catch you off guard, where you as an audience member are generally frightened for what is about to happen. These movies follow no clich√©d plot lines nor are they predictable by any means. In The Witch, I was led on a journey that was so terrifying if only because the audience knows something that the family does not: there is a witch, indeed.Our first introduction to her is a scene so disturbing and eerie that my mouth hung open the entire scene. It's not long after the baby goes missing. There are a few shots as we see the witch mostly in shadows, as she goes about business that takes fear to a new level. The imagery coupled with some extremely Kubrick-ian music (think 2001: A Space Odyssey), this becomes a film so drenched with tone and darkness that it draws your attention even in the quietest of scenes.I really don't want to say too much more about the story, except that the family grows to suspect the eldest daughter for a variety of coincidental reasons. Though we know there is a satanic force lurking in the trees, the majority of the films turns inward as we watch a family devoted to God unravel with suspicion and fear. It's a believable family, with the father a kind and compassionate man, his wife God-fearing and unhinged, and children that are raised to know little more than good versus evil and His Holy Word.Robert Eggers directed and wrote the film in an astonishing debut as a filmmaker. There is a confidence in his style that already feels like it comes from a master. The performances he draws out of his small cast (especially the children) are remarkable, and at times this feels like a movie that is already a classic in the horror genre. My sole concerns (and deductions in the rating) come from the film's ending, one that feels cheap and unneeded for a movie so layered with style. It's a film that uses no special effects until the very last moments, and even then, was it really necessary? The final moments also contain a reveal that shows the truth hidden throughout the entire film, and even then, perhaps a bit of ambiguity wouldn't have hurt.The Babadook. It Follows. The Witch. Year after year we have seen a select group of films that simply redefine psychological horror, and they are few and far between. The trailers beforehand included two or three movies billed as being scary yet appear to be little more than slasher films with buckets of gore and fake blood. When will filmmakers learn that it isn't blood that frightens an audience, it is the unknown. Do not miss this movie.",10,7,13,1 February 2017
Sausage Party," Actually shopping for food is a more thrilling experience...
","SAUSAGE PARTY is a good movie in the same way someone might describe McDonald's as being a satisfying meal. There are laughs, you get what you paid for, but in the end you leave feeling a bit sick for enjoying it and vow to change your eating habits before next time. I mean viewing habits. Seth Rogen's stoner homage to Disney & Pixar is surely filled with moments that will make audiences gasp and laugh, but if we are going to watch an R-rated animated film about talking food, is it bad for me to ask for better quality?When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was unaware it was an adult-themed movie until about midway through. We see a hot dog weiner flirting with a feminine-looking bun, and I recall thinking this was a bit risqu√© even for a kid's movie. Then came the carnage and I understood. The basic premise is that food is alive. When we purchase it at grocery stores, they know little of the horrors that are soon to come. Humans are merely gods who are here to take food into the glorious afterlife. They even have a song welcoming our arrival each morning.It's the Fourth of July so Bun and Weiner (I forget their names, but wouldn't that only confuse you?) are excited to finally get to spend time together. They are packaged near one another, and dream of the day they are finally selected to go to the great beyond. As plot would have it, they are purchased, but by a strange twist of fate, they esape their packaging and roll away in a deadly two-cart collision. The rest of the hot dogs go home to discover the true horrors of dinnertime, while Bun and Weiner meet some friends at the store (a Jewish bagel (complete with Woody Allen's accent) and a Middle Eastern flatbread, complete with beard). Their plan is to return to packaging to be sold tomorrow.Remember 'The Interview' and the buzz that was built up prior to its Netflix release? What a disappointment the film ended up being, and in many ways this movie measures up just as well. A sort of passion project for Seth Rogen over the past 10 years, it's sad to think this is the end result. The plot is meandering and the situations these foods find themselves in uninteresting. The dialogue is a barrage of the 'f' word if for no other reason than the film is rated R. There's also an extended sequence where Weiner and some other non-perishables get high (what can we expect) and an ending that is quite literally a grocery store orgy.There are laughable parts (a piece of chewed up gum as Stephen Hawking was brilliantly done) and some unfortunate parts (the film spends a large chunk of time joking about the political and global status of Israel), not to mention a barrage of racial jokes that are at times off-putting. The movie is an admirable effort to make animated features more for adults. Apparently adults can't get enough potty humor. Watch the trailer - the funny parts are there. The rest of the movie is fluff.",4,0,3,1 February 2017
There Will Be Blood," ... One day this movie will be called a MASTERPIECE!...
","I entered the theater to see this movie with expectations at a minimum. Most critics I had read (Roger Ebert, etc) didn't RAVE about this film like they did 'No Country...' By the time the scene where the oil well explodes and H.W. goes deaf - this movie became my favorite movie of the year - heck - of the 21st Century! - I was 100% enthralled and absorbed by the beauty of this film!I have seen prior works by Daniel Day-Lewis, but I had never realized how brilliant of an actor he really is. the range of his emotions and commitment to the character - not to mention his body language, perfect accent, etc. - earned him the most well-deserved Oscar in recent years.Not only is the acting spot-on (I think Paul Dano was denied a deserving Best Supporting Actor nomination) 'There Will Be Blood' is also a BEAUTIFUL film to watch. the first time i saw it i didn't really notice the cinematography - but my second viewing had me gaping - jaw open! i also think this Oscar was well-deserved - even more so than the brilliant roger deakins. the use of sunlight to whiteout and corrupt the picture is beautiful to look at, and the lush color-scheme created in this film was clearly superior to the other cinematography front-runners at the academy awards this year: 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' and 'No Country for Old Men.' - both films using a color palate of warm yellows while incorporating the beauty of black as the main look of the films - still beautiful nonetheless!I know other people thought the music was distracting, clich√© to movies like 'the Shining,' but I thought otherwise. It gives the film a unique edge and makes those memorable scenes that much more memorable. (ex- the scene when Daniel grabs his son and begins running away from the gushing oil - the buildup of rhythmic percussion is inspired!)I think that the character Day-Lewis plays is also one of the most fascinating and memorable ever features in a movie. His consuming greed and passion for oil overpowers his love for his son. It leads him to commit the most vile acts, yet he feels no remorse. From my perspective, Plainview has committed his entire life to his job. He assumedly has never married, therefore never had children. This might sound odd and creepy, but I would imagine his character has never experienced true 'intimacy' with another woman - all the way to the finale of the movie. He is a 2-dimensional driven character with a brilliant 3- dimensional portrayal.PLEASE- i recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing what movie magic is all about - and seeing what a film-masterpiece truly is! **********/********** stars!!!!!!!",10,2,5,15 April 2008
Arrival," Loopholes aside this is an astonishing personal drama... with aliens
","'Arrival' is the kind of movie I wanted to watch with as little information as possible. The trailer intrigued me and roused my interest: a story of aliens finally making first contact, and our inability to understand them. How that could sustain itself for a 2-hour run time was beyond me, but this (I'm thrilled to say) is a movie full of beauty that just about left me spellbound.Our heroine is Louise (Amy Adams in what has got to be one of her best roles), a linguist who teaches at a college and lives alone in a glass house overlooking a lake. We learn about her daughter, a smart young girl who died of cancer at a young age. It's a heartbreaking opening to the film, a set up to a story that has more emotion than the sci- fi genre would have you believe. Suddenly, large orbs appear all over the world. It makes the news and interrupts the class with a barrage of phone calls and texts. No one can verify them as man-made, and the locations around the planet seem strategic. This is indeed first contact. People are glued to the TV and buildings are evacuated. I wonder what would happen if aliens ever were to touch down on earth. I would assume this is as accurate as I would imagine.Louise is contacted almost immediately by a Colonel (Forest Whitaker), who confirms contact has been made with the alien beings, and yet no promising communication can be made. He asks her to decipher an audio clip that sounds as much like a language as a whale's call. It's impossible. Louise confirms that the only way to actually learn would be to have a face-to-face encounter; to teach them the rudimentary words and go from there... You start with the word for 'human' and end with the answer to the complex question 'what are your intentions here on earth?'The spaceship is one of the many striking aspects of the film, first revealed in a grand shot in the wilderness of Montana. Fog spills over green hills, and there on the horizon is a black mass 1,000 feet in the air, hovering just above the ground. A military base is set up nearby, and work is quickly underway. The entrance to the ship is a 10-foot hole that opens at the base every 18 hours. A cherry picker raises the crew inside the chasm, and a change in gravity allows them to literally walk up the walls to a meeting chamber. I wonder how they first made this discovery, or who was the first to agree to venture inside the menacing ship.There is a twist of sorts at the climax of the film that leaves you reeling over the images and moments leading up to it. It still has me scratching my head by the complexity of it, and left me somber at it's implications. This is a deus ex machina to end all deus ex machinas, and yet I was moved by the way it worked out (rather than feeling cheated). The climax ends in a way that could only happen through specific series of events, and if you think too hard about what is happening you will only hurt yourself. How badly I want to ask you questions about the movie, the ending, the aliens (10-foot tall beings that look like upright squid), and the expansive questions of fate and choice. This is a brilliant movie directed by Denis Villeneuve (he made one of the decade's best movies last year with 'Sicario') and the talent displayed is bar-none some of the best filmmaking around right now. The score by J√≥hann J√≥hannsson is surely an Oscar-contender for it's ease in slipping back and forth between sounds of horror and orchestral moments of harmony. For a film this complex, giving a concise review is hard. It's better to just advise you to see this movie as soon as possible, and perhaps plan ahead to see it twice.",9,1,6,16 January 2017
La Vie En Rose," 'La Vie En Rose' = French Masterpiece
","I have to say, the first time I heard about this film was watching the golden globe 'press conference.' i, just after seeing Juno, was fully expecting Ellen page to win best actress (m/c). when they announced Cotillard, i was like 'WTF?'... never again.I decided to go out and rent it to see what it was all about. that may have been the best decision of my life. this movie is a cinematic MIRACLE! Everything about this movie intrigued me - cinematography (the 5 min. shot in Cotillard's apartment is AMAZING!) music, acting, makeup (did you SEE what Cotillard looks like in real life?!?!?!? - HOT), direction, back-and-forth editing, and, most of all, Marion Cotillard.The first thing i thought after seeing this film was: why wasn't she up for best actress (drama) at the g.g.'s. the second thing was: why is Julie Christie stealing all these awards from Cotillard!?!?!?!?! i truly believe Cotillard's work in 'la vie en rose' is the best acting and role-playing ever put on film. her scenes are just breathtaking.So, naturally, when Oscar nominees were announced, i was thrilled Cotillard was up. the funny thing was, that most people had never even heard of this movie! the fact that the academy abandoned Christie and went for a newcomer (in the nomination sense) from France speaks WONDERS of the academy's credibility. I couldn't have been happier with the results, and i personally think this movie tops the list of best biopics ever made! (and yes, i'm including 'raging bull!')YOU ALL OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,3,6,27 February 2008
Deadpool," I know I'm the minority...
","Deadpool comes from a place rooted in Marvel-mania and geekdom. The entire premise seems like one born from the want of fans to have it so, and in fact much of the content of the movie suggests it by winking at the camera at every possible opportunity. It has already been a massive box office success, and as of February 17th it has nearly a 9.0 on IMDb. I didn't enter the film with high expectations (similar to my feelings about Guardians of the Galaxy) so I can't say I was surprised to realize the film is an utter let-down.It seems like Marvel is making a new movie every few months or so, and it seems like an easy chore for them to dish out a movie, throw in a couple recognizable characters, and watch the cash come rolling in. The wackier the story, the 'bigger chance' it was to make, but have they ever had a true flop? The comic book world has impregnated our psyche, whether you have read them or not. Everyone wants to be in the 'know.'Deadpool seems to be a response to Guardians, following an unlikely 'superhero' (Ryan Reynolds) as he casually jokes through a plot that would otherwise be full of immense peril. When Chris Pratt challenged the evil galaxy-ruler guy to a dance off at the climax of Guardians, it felt funny and fresh. When Deadpool stops in a battle to look at the camera and mention a joke about Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, I just sighed. There's a self- awareness throughout the film that simply removed me from the movie. At one point, Reynolds remarks 'don't make my costume CGI' as he begins his superhero transformation (a painful reference to his Green Lantern stint). This is like a grown-up Airplane parody, where characters know they are acting and the good guy never misses his target no matter how far away he is with the gun. Most people I have talked to describe this movie as a fresh comedy. I saw it as a parody a bit too on-the-nose.Knowing nothing about Deadpool/Wade going in, of course we had to trudge through a backstory filled with sex and jokes and throwaway characters that all culminate in the creation of his costume, stitched at home of course (red hides the blood better). We learn that though he fell in love, Deadpool was diagnosed with cancer and left the woman he loved in order to find a cure. What he found as well was a new power of rejuvenation, strength, and witty one-liners.Let's be honest: Ryan Reynolds is an attractive guy. Ladies love him and guys want to be him. Besides this, his role in this film just falls flat. Through narration, breaking the 4th wall, voice-over, and cutaways, all I wanted was for him to shut up. Sometimes, a simple action scene is cool in itself without being littered with gags and humor and comedy, oh my! Playing the comedian, of course the rest of the cast (a couple of X-Men I have never heard of that were apparently the only ones available for the shoot) plays it straight, gawking at the absurdity of Deadpool's light-heartedness and trying to convince him to just shut up and focus on the task at hand. The task at hand (defeating the villain ‚Äì what else?) is a cookie-cutter plot that is as predictable as we would expect. I mentioned he is aided by some of the X-Men, so it should come as no surprise that Deadpool comments on the fact that studios couldn't afford more recognizable actors for some quick cameos¬ÖYou can tell the filmmakers were trying to be original (an opening credits scene that is nothing but puns and in-jokes: 'directed by someone who was paid too much,' 'starring the sexist man in America,' etc. If that's comedy, then I'm sorry I didn't laugh. If the fanboys are happy with the film, then I'm sure the Marvel Studio is pleased. Perhaps in a year or two when they release Deadpool II, they can work out the kinks that weighted this film down. For a movie so highly regarded as a hip romantic comedy, boy was I bored.",4,5,13,1 February 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Welcome back Mel
","Mel Gibson is certainly a director of considerable talent, and excusing his brushes with scandal, he is still a man who knows his craft and exudes a confidence on screen. 'Hacksaw Ridge' is his first directorial effort in 10 years, and although at times the films fails to reach it's full potential, it's still a reminder that Gibson isn't someone we want banished from Hollywood.In a time when it feels like World War II movies have been tired out, here comes another one that tells the true story of Desmond Doss. Unlike most soldiers, Doss is a Seventh Day Adventist who refuses to go against the 10 Commandments, particularly the one against killing. Enlisting to serve his country, his only slight is that he will not touch a gun. At first he is told that this will be acceptable. Boot camp certainly proves him wrong.This is a movie that is told in two very distinct parts: the blossoming romance on the eve of enlistment, and the hellfire of battle itself. When you think of a war movie you must introduce the characters as everyday people. Doss is raised in Virginia, son to a drunk and lover to a nurse at a nearby hospital. On their first date he can't help but stare at her in the dark, ignoring the newsreel footage of battle. In another film that black and white image would be enough to spark Doss to enlist. Instead, he just smiles and smiles and wonders whether he should kiss her or not.We see the fragments of why he is so against violence. His father (Hugo Weaving) who at one time lost his friends in World War I, is now a raging alcoholic who takes out his anger on both wife and kids. His only solace is the cemetery where his friends are now buried. Guns are expected in war, but in life, Doss sees them as a tool to only incite destruction. When so many people arm themselves to fight, he decides to work as a medic to try and save people instead.Boot camp sees all the typical scenes one might expect, including peer bullying, obstacle courses, and a barrage of insults from the drill instructor (Vince Vaughn in a curiously non-comedic role. His performance and delivery of lines is astonishingly bad in an otherwise fine cast. This is the first true time I can honestly say that an actor was absolutely miscast). As he continues to refuse weapons training, Doss is thrown in a military prison and threatened to be locked up the duration of the war. We know he won't be, but it's still required in the film to establish the drama of the scenario.As I said, the film is very clearly two stories, and part two hits the audience like a freight train as the nightmare of battle manifests on screen. Gibson, the director whose battle scenes in 'Braveheart' are still considered some of the best of their kind, knows how to film action. The left-to-right path of the allies move across screen at Hacksaw Ridge; a precipice of mud and trenches on the shores of Okinawa. Taking this fortress means changing the tides of war. The battle which is filmed in extended sequences that truly are horrific, show blood and gore the likes of which we haven't seen in a war film in quite some time. Steven Spielberg didn't necessarily revolutionize war films with 'Saving Private Ryan,' but the intensity certainly hearkens back to it.Doss is remembered as having saved nearly 100 wounded soldiers from the battlefield when all other troops retreated. Through the night and into the next day, he worked to slowly drag men from the mud and lower them down a 50-foot cliff to their salvation. It's almost too fantastic to be a true story, and yet Mel Gibson himself said he was drawn to this story because it was about 'a real life superhero without the spandex.' After the war Doss even became the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.The film (nearly 2.5 hours) wraps up so quickly that it felt like a 3-hour movie that was missing the final reel. A quick montage shows the final moments of the battle and show some incredible real-life footage of the elderly men who actually knew Doss. Aside from some moments of clich√© (how can a war film ever seek to be original when so much has been seen) and that brisk wrap-up to such an unbelievable story, I still would recommend the movie. Andrew Garfield in the leading role is at times a bit too hammy to demonstrate the depth a character like this would have, although such selflessness is maybe 100% accurate. I was happy to learn a bit more about one of America's unknown heroes.",7,1,7,16 January 2017
Sully," A missed opportunity
","Clint Eastwood has nothing to prove to anyone anymore. Having won a handful of Oscars and directed two Best Picture winners, we are only so lucky to have such an esteemed veteran behind the camera (he just turned 86 this past year). His repertoire covers a wide range of subject and setting, from westerns to historical pictures to modern fiction. He has hit's and misses. It's unfortunate that such an inspiring story as the Miracle on the Hudson could wind up so flat on the big screen.It wasn't but a few years ago, and I know we all know the story - how Captain Sullenburger successfully ditched his US Airways flight into the river just outside of Manhattan and miraculously kept everyone on board alive and well. It was a 1 in a million landing, all the more spectacular and alarming for taking place so close to Ground Zero. The world proclaimed him a hero, but (you guessed it) some had initial doubts.The story itself follows Sully in the immediate aftermath of the landing, when he and his copilot (Aaron Echart as Jeff Skiles) are hotel-bound while a hearing is underway to investigate the cause of the crash. Sully frequently calls his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney) at home to assure her that he is okay and will be home soon. The hearings proceed simultaneous to an endless barrage of news coverage and late night appearances. In the same day, Sully met with both Katie Couric and David Letterman.The trailer promised a somewhat suspenseful story with a crash scene that would rival that of the movie 'Flight.' We flash back several times in the film to the actual incident, when birds struck both engines and caused the plane to lose forward thrust. The entire incident was so quick (200 seconds or so) that Eastwood devotes several scenes to show the crash in it's entirety from various perspectives. It's a Rashomon approach in many ways, and the effect is a powerful testament to the quick wits of not only Sully but the flight crew and the Coast Guard and even passersby watching a plane descend into the frigid Hudson River in disbelief.Tom Hanks, of course, plays the titular character. He is barely there, so steadfast in his beliefs and quiet in his doubts, I don't think any other man would be as suited for the role. One would think that this would be a sure bet for an Oscar nomination (and well overdue: Hanks hasn't been nominated since Cast Away in 2000) but his performance is as muted and subtle as anything he has done. From crash to court hearings, Sully is played as a man you understand to be a real hero. He is quiet, determined, scared of being wrong but persistent when he knows he is right.The villains (the National Transportation Safety Board who scrutinize his every move) are often laughable and there for the obvious reason of creating more cinematic drama. I don't know how factual the film is in regards to the final scenes, but we are led to believe that Sully is on the cusp of being fired for having endangered the lives of everyone on board. Flight simulations (and we see no less than 4 entire flight simulation sequences, mind you) prove that the plane could have landed safely at LaGuardia, and it comes down to a simple speech by Sully in which human error ultimately would have made landing on a runway impossible.When the movie is good, it's good, but when it's not, it's apparent. There are many sequences of PTSD and such from Sully's perspective that feel taped on and hasty. A dream sequence in which Katie Couric presents a news story about Sully being a fraud is forced to say the least. Clint Eastwood has never been a meticulous director known for precision edits or immaculate framing. Sully simply feels like a rough cut that required a few more trims to make it feel concise. Hanks is great, of course, and the story is inspiring. The film itself leaves a bit to be desired. Still, for a man closer to 90 years old in age, I doubt you will find a more assured director working today.",5,0,2,1 February 2017
