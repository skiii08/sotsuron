The King's Speech," The King's Speech (2010)
","Directed by Tom Hooper. Starring Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Derek Jacobi, Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon, Jennifer Ehle, Eve Best. (R)With the advent of the radio, long gone are the days when the British Royal Family need only look the part--they also need to serve as the voice of the nation. This does not bode well for future King Edward VI (Firth), who has been afflicted with a considerable stammer since childhood; enter speech therapist Rush. Well-produced and acted historical drama works best when focusing on the relationship between the two men, the techniques and frustrations and slowly-developing friendship; less successful when parading familiar historical figures around the fringes (Churchill (Spall) seems present only because he is recognizable, not because of any truth to his role in these events) or glossing over politics, especially appeasement and the sympathies of certain high-ranking politicians and royals. Alexandre Desplat's slowly swelling score is well-integrated for the lions' share of the film, but becomes overbearing during the climactic speech, while director Hooper's all-too-obvious montage of inspired parties across the city and country nullifies the gravitas of the words. One of those perfectly serviceable motion pictures with substantial levels of decoration (four Oscars, including Best Picture and Director) best remembered in the years after for its unaccountable triumph over far weightier and more daring fare.71/100",7,1,1,6 January 2020
First Man," First Man (2018)
","Directed by Damien Chazelle. Starring Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Kyle Chandler, Ciar√°n Hinds, Jason Clarke, Corey Stoll, Shea Whigham, Christopher Abbott, Lukas Haas, Patrick Fugit, Olivia Hamilton, Gavin Warren. (PG-13)Visually striking but curiously earthbound biopic/historical drama focusing on Neil Armstrong (Gosling) and NASA's efforts to put him on the moon during the 1960s. Film's brushstrokes are often painted in a detached, procedural fashion, aiming more for docudrama authenticity than stirring melodrama. While this pursuit seems appropriate given the enigmatic character of its hero, it misses out on opportunities to find the music and poetry in such a colossal endeavor, only occasionally finding its beating heart and expressive imagination. Nevertheless, the technical achievement on display cannot be overlooked (especially the sensational X-15 test pilot and lunar landing sequences) and the script and performances are solid across the board; Foy, as Armstrong's wife, Janet, stands out among the reliable cast. Could have been a nice companion piece to 'The Right Stuff' (which focused on the Mercury program, while this one involved the Gemini and Apollo missions), but can't compete with the earlier masterpiece in scope, meaning, or entertainment value; still worth a look, though, especially to those interested in the space race.74/100",7,1,3,23 July 2019
Black Swan," Black Swan (2010)
","Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Starring Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder, Benjamin Millepied, Ksenia Solo, Kristina Anapau, Toby Hemingway, Sebastian Stan. (R)NYC ballet company impresario Cassel is opening the season with his 'reimage' of 'Swan Lake' and needs to cast the dual-faceted Swan Queen; dedicated ballerina Portman is perfect for the technical, precise White Swan, but lacks the bold, seductive qualities needed for the Black Swan. Part cutthroat backstage melodrama, part paranoid psychological horror film, elevated by Portman's obsessive, transformative performance as a cloistered ingenue willing to go as far as needed to achieve artistic perfection. Some of the plot developments and symbolism can be obvious, only finding striking notes of astonishment when it retreats into Portman's psyche and lets her growing madness obfuscate reality. Aronofsky's feverish, gripping vision blurs the docudrama-style grittiness of his 'The Wrestler' with the bracing, messy nightmares of his 'Pi' and 'Requiem for a Dream'; it's the sort of movie that he seemed destined to make, and only he could deliver quite like this. Strong supporting performances and Matthew Libatique's sensational camera work are worthy of praise as well, though a movie like this is bound to polarize no matter its actorly and technical qualities.84/100",8,1,1,13 November 2019
Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Dream (2000)
","Directed by Darren Aronofsky. Starring Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, Christopher McDonald, Louise Lasser, Keith David, Mark Margolis, Marcia Jean Kurtz, Sean Gullette.Unflinching portrait of addiction focusing on four desperate characters: a widow hooked on amphetamine diet pills (Burstyn), her son (Leto), plus his friend (Wayans) and girlfriend (Connelly), the latter three all heroin junkies. It doesn't take long for director Aronofsky's arresting filmmaking techniques to either electrify or repulse (depending on the viewer's tolerance for his method), using hypnotically rapid-fire editing, symbolic split screens, musical leitmotifs (composed by Clint Mansell), filters, film speed variations, and more to both simulate narrative and character urgency as well as mimic (but absolutely not glorify) the intense kick and all-too-quick dissolution of a drug high. There's no judgment or piety here, just an intense, skin-crawling examination of dependency, of degradation, of lives shattering; an inevitable result, but still painful to witness. No slackers in this cast, but Burstyn is especially good, delusion segueing into hallucination, all recorded in her physical expressions and cracking voice; hers is the most affecting tragic arc since she was the closest to innocence before the talons sunk in. A bit too lurid and cynical at times, with only a few veritable angles on theme/plot to set it apart from a dozen so-called 'drug movies' before it, but it's the way it's told that sticks with the viewer and makes it a harrowingly unforgettable experience. Originally slapped with an NC-17 rating and then released unrated into theaters; avoid the compromised R-rated home video copies.91/100",9,0,0,26 August 2019

","Directed by George Lucas. Starring Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Pernilla August, Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Ray Park, Hugh Quarshie, Oliver Ford Davies, Terence Stamp. (PG)Long-awaited continuation of the 'Star Wars' saga, and arguably the most hyped movie event in cinematic history; prequel series tells the story of how Anakin Skywalker would be trained in the ways of the Jedi but eventually turn to the Dark Side and become Darth Vader. Unfortunately, the film decides to focus on events when Anakin (Lloyd) is just a precocious moptop, and an utterly uninteresting one at that. Had the surrounding story and events been exciting, it could have been forgivable, but trade embargo drama and ponderous Jedi philosophizing hardly generate fireworks--if Lucas intended to make a space fantasy movie for children (as he claims), why isn't it more fun? Stilted dialogue and formulaic characterizations abound, and the special effects wizardry would have been more impressive if there wasn't so much of it; many landscapes and action sequences (especially the battle outside Naboo) look far too cartoonish. On the plus side, a nifty lightsaber duel set to bombastic John Williams music; on the negative side, everything that is Jar Jar Binks (Best). Several familiar characters make appearances; McGregor's Padawan version of Obi-Wan Kenobi is the standout.37/100",4,1,3,14 October 2019
Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch (2011)
","Directed by Zack Snyder. Starring Emily Browning, Oscar Isaac, Abbie Cornish, Carla Gugino, Jena Malone, Scott Glenn, Jamie Chung, Vanessa Hudgens, Jon Hamm, Gerard Plunkett. (PG-13)Pointless, humorless exercise in all-style-no-substance, presented as auteurist-vision, but the auteur is an emperor without clothes (or a clue). After being committed to an asylum by her sadistic guardian, Browning copes with the horrors of her situation by imagining herself as a prisoner-dancer in a burlesque house (leading to a different raft of horrors), then going another layer deeper into her imagination by becoming a pin-up warrior in CGI-soaked battlegrounds. She and her fellow dancers wear fetishistic adornments and fight armies of enemies (often in obnoxious slo-mo); it sometimes looks pretty, but there's no tension or excitement in these passive-participant video games, and the stakes couldn't be lower or vaguer if an invincibility cheat code had been entered. The movie trots out undeveloped female 'heroes' that look clipped out of 'Maxim' magazine, lets the camera leer at them at length while subjecting them to endless abuse, threats and violence, then slaps its own wrist for being naughty and protests that it's all about female empowerment; co-writer/director Snyder clearly wants to have his cake and slobber on it, too. Deplorable provocation aside, its greatest sin is just being a dreadful bore. One may need a sucker punch right to the kisser to stay awake.10/100",1,1,6,17 December 2019
Finding Neverland," Finding Neverland (2004)
","Directed by Marc Forster. Starring Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Freddie Highmore, Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman, Nick Roud, Radha Mitchell, Joe Prospero, Luke Spill, Kelly Macdonald, Ian Hart, Angus Barnett. (PG)Genteel account of playwright J.M. Barrie (Depp), stranded in a rather aloof and loveless marriage, forming a deep friendship with a widow (Winslet) and her four boys; his relationship with the children goes on to inspire his most famous creation of Peter Pan, the boy who could fly. Treated less as a biopic or historical drama than a fantasy of the imagination (just as well, since many liberties are taken with the facts, and the more ungainly rumors/suspicions are entirely ignored), with the real and unreal interwoven during performance/reading flights of fancy. Tender and poignant, it may lack an especially compelling narrative but makes do with understated charm, humor and sadness. Hoffman provides a dry but droll counterpoint to Depp's irrepressible eccentricities; Christie is on hand to provide some semblance of a villain, but the matter is wisely underplayed and sacrificed by the conclusion. The imagined action can be a bit underwhelming at times, but the design of the pirate ship sequence on the high seas is a delight.73/100",7,0,0,3 January 2020

Starring John Boyega, Will Poulter, Jacob Latimore, Algee Smith, Jason Mitchell, Hannah Murray, Kaitlyn Dever, Nathan Davis Jr., Ben O'Toole, Jack Reynor, Anthony Mackie, Peyton Alex Smith, Malcolm David Kelley, Joseph David-Jones. (R)Searing period drama detailing events during the 1967 Detroit riots, especially the Algiers Hotel incident where local law enforcement assaulted several young men and women, resulting in multiple deaths. Bigelow's intense, up-close filmmaking style makes this a grueling experience, exhausting at length, even numbing, but ultimately the sort of visceral experience that overlooks nuance and depth in order to hammer home an effective emotional response. Because the characterizations are so defined by in-the-moment action and individual-as-community representation, there isn't always a sense of background and internal motivation that might have explained specific behavior, reaction, attitude or accountability; the audience is forced to make their judgments based on knowledge of historical context and personal opinion. Well-acted by a talented cast despite the shallowness of the personas they inhabit; as propaganda of outrage, though, the film is a startling one that should linger uncomfortably.75/100",7,0,2,16 January 2020

","Directed by Dexter Fletcher. Starring Taron Egerton, Jamie Bell, Bryce Dallas Howard, Richard Madden, Stephen Graham, Charlie Rowe, Steven Mackintosh, Kit Connor, Tate Donovan, Celinde Schoenmaker, Matthew Illesley, Ophelia Lovibond. (R)The life and times of rock star Elton John (Egerton), told largely through flashback from a rehab group session. Not so much a biopic as a musical fantasy, allowing the film to cleverly avoid accusations of being a 'true story' with numerous historical inaccuracies (which it certainly has), or being a formulaic jukebox musical that trots out loads of popular hits (which it certainly does); music and image have a life of its own here, shattering the constrains of reality, informing the emotion and experience of its flamboyant protagonist, and giving the familiar songs new context and fresh voice (Egerton did his own singing). The scene near the end with Elton confronting the ghosts of his past is crashingly obvious, and certain episodes are brushed over too hastily (his relationship with eventual wife of four years, Renate Blauel, comes out of nowhere and ends just as quickly). Egerton is sensational as the music legend, inhabiting the role enough to almost (but not quite) disappear inside it; Fletcher (who previously took over directing duties from Bryan Singer on a different gay British rock n' roll icon picture, the greatly inferior 'Bohemian Rhapsody') stages several visually exciting musical numbers both onstage and off.70/100",7,1,1,17 October 2019
To Be or Not to Be," To Be or Not to Be (1942)
","Directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Starring Jack Benny, Carole Lombard, Robert Stack, Stanley Ridges, Sig Ruman, Lionel Atwill, Felix Bressart, Tom Dugan, Henry Victor, Charles Halton, Maude Eburne.First-rate farce, augmented by astute satirical and black comedy elements, was a dangerous proposition at the time of its release when the world was at war, tensions were high, and funny bones were invulnerable to elbow nudges. 'Great, great Polish actor' Benny, his even more famous actress wife Lombard, and the rest of their theatre troupe get involved in a spy masquerade in Nazi-occupied Warsaw. Stack is the Polish aviator sweet on Lombard, Ruman the bumbling colonel, Dugan as the f√ºhrer (but not really) in one of the movie's better gags. Has hardly aged a day, and even though some of the set-ups are overextended, there are no shortage of laughs. Mockery of ideology is a potent weapon, indeed. Final film for Lombard, who died in a plane crash shortly before the film was released.82/100",8,0,0,18 March 2020

","Directed by Terry Jones. Starring Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Sue Jones-Davies, Terry Gilliam, John Young, Terence Bayler, Carol Cleveland. (R)All-time great comedy from British troupe Monty Python, delivering an uproarious religious satire about Brian Cohen (Chapman), a sad-eyed, oft-bewildered man with a nervously rebellious spirit against Roman rule in Judea who eventually gets mistaken for the Messiah. His experiences loosely parallel those of Christ (seen briefly in direct and reverent fashion, played by Kenneth Colley), but the film is anything but blasphemous since its silly attacks don't aim at faith and divinity but rather hypocrisy, stubbornness, misunderstanding, groupthink, and overly pious biblical epics in general. What it is, however, is funny--very, very funny, in ways that only Python was ever able to truly master, specifically how they dress up clever and barbed commentary in the guise of sheer, tacky lunacy, and making the humor consistently work on both levels. Those who are offended by the jokes are the ones that go in wanting to be offended; all others need worry about just one thing: laughing so hard that it hurts.97/100",10,0,2,25 January 2020

Starring Steve Buscemi, Simon Russell Beale, Jeffrey Tambor, Michael Palin, Jason Isaacs, Andrea Riseborough, Paul Whitehouse, Rupert Friend, Paul Chahidi, Paddy Considine, Olga Kurylenko, Adrian McLoughlin. (R)'In the Loop' director Iannucci delivers another brilliantly incisive satire in the political realm, this time dealing with the frantic, backstabbing power-grab in the Soviet Union after the sudden death of Joseph Stalin (McLoughlin). A skillful balance between the hysterical and horrific, sometimes separate and sometimes overlapping. Cast is pitch-perfect, finding just the right tone for the jet-black comedy by playing it straight-faced and anxious, but never fully sober; Tambor's pathetic and vain Georgy Malenkov and Isaacs' blunt and pompously aggressive Marshal Zhukov stand out, but there are no slackers (and it's a treat to see Palin onscreen again). Won't be for all tastes, especially those who have delicate sensibilities or are sticklers for historical accuracy, but it's not for nothing that Iannucci (and co-writers Ian Martin and David Schneider) often had to tone down the irrational insanity of the actual characters and situations so that it wouldn't seem so unbelievable. Understandably banned in Russia, but that's their loss.89/100",9,0,0,23 March 2020

","Directed by Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck. Starring Brie Larson, Samuel L.

(PG-13)Air Force pilot and amnesiac member (Larson) of an intergalactic fighting force lands on Earth and uncovers the truth of her past while allying herself with Nick Fury (Jackson), agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Set in the 1990s (with nods to Blockbuster Video and a soundtrack full of alt-rock tunes from the era to constantly remind the audience, since nothing else does), but the film opens in outer space on a planet called Hala, plunging the audience directly into a conflict with an alien race while citing names and mythology that the uninitiated will struggle to understand (or care about). Gets better once it settles down, but like most films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, lacks a compelling or exciting villain and leads to a frenetic but wearisome climax with lots of light and noise but little dramatic interest. Larson is fine as the underdeveloped hero (her superpowers are sketchily-explained at best), Jackson gets more to do than usual, and there are hints of a commendable but weakly-integrated 'girl power' theme, but it's not one of the better comic book origin stories out there. There's a cute kitty cat in the mix, at least.46/100",5,1,8,14 September 2019

Lee Ermey, Michael Rooker, Stephen Tobolowsky, Kevin Dunn, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Badja Djola, Park Overall. (R)Searing, racially-charged drama loosely based on fact, with a pair of FBI agents--a former southern sheriff (Hackman) and a square-jawed Justice Department transfer (Dafoe)--traveling into Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers in 1964. Manipulative and heavy-handed at times, to be sure, and pretty poor as a history lesson, but the filmmakers clearly intended this to be a gripping thriller, not a docudrama; choosing a real life case and tilting the perspective may not have been the wisest choice, but the film does exactly what it sets out to do, and delivers a dramatic powerhouse in terms of incendiary entertainment. Terrific performances (especially from Hackman, McDormand and Dourif) and Parker's forceful but composed direction make up for weaknesses in the script; vivid, Oscar-winning photography from Peter Biziou. A more true-to-life TV-movie, 'Murder in Mississippi,' was produced a couple years later depicting the events leading up to the murder of the civil rights workers.81/100",8,0,1,4 December 2019

(R)Entertaining depiction of the perilous operation to rescue six American Embassy diplomats who eluded capture and hid themselves at the Canadian ambassador's house at the outset of the Iran hostage crisis. The 'best of the bad ideas' to save them? Mock up a phony Hollywood film production for a 'Star Wars'-ripoff called 'Argo' and convince Iranian authorities that the workers are part of the production crew doing a location scout. A truth-is-stranger-than-fiction concept (classified for the better part of twenty years) given a crowd-pleasing and streamlined treatment--serves as a poor history lesson, and some viewers will find the changes to be unforgivable (even insulting), but it's presumably done for the sake of a clear, uncluttered story. Affleck's sure-handed direction balances the dire tension in Tehran with refreshing humor in Hollywood; manufactures palpable suspense even with the outcome known in advance (though the runway chase is a bit too much). Fine cast, with Goodman and Arkin delivering plenty of hilarious zingers and walking away with the movie.

","Directed by Gore Verbinski. Starring Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Geoffrey Rush, Jack Davenport, Jonathan Pryce, Kevin R. McNally, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Giles New, Angus Barnett, Damian O'Hare, Zoe Saldana. (PG-13)Bloated pirate swashbuckler, superficially based on the Disney theme park attraction (because a Broadway musical about log flumes was considered too daring?), accompanied by supernatural elements that co-mingle with the usual cannon fire and swordplay. Depp is the grogged-up and swishy Jack Sparrow, former captain of the 'cursed' ship, the Black Pearl; he reluctantly teams up with a blacksmith (Bloom) to thwart the villainous, ghostly Barbossa (Rush), who has kidnapped Bloom's lady love (Knightley). Stylish, atmospheric, intricately-designed production has plenty of action and humor, dominated by an enjoyably amusing performance from Depp, even if a little less of him would have made him more endearing. Unfortunately, the film is also fatally overlong, with at least one too many large-scale action sequences, not to mention repetitive fights that go on and on, long past the point that mild excitement transitions to tedium (overall interest dies out sometime in the middle of the broadside-bombarding sea battle...and there's still almost an hour left to go!). The first film under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to earn a PG-13 rating, which no doubt helped it attract the lucrative teenager crowd and turn it into a major blockbuster; big enough, it seems, to warrant four sequels to date.55/100",5,1,2,10 November 2019

Soles, Sean Young, John Larroquette, John Diehl, Conrad Dunn, Judge Reinhold, Roberta Leighton, Robert J. Wilke, Antone Pag√°n, Glenn-Michael Jones. (R)After losing his job, car, and girlfriend on the same day, Murray convinces pal Ramis that they should join the army to be all they can be...or whatever. Like the boot camp comedy from the previous year ('Private Benjamin'), this fitfully funny film works best when dealing with the rigors and characteristics of basic training, and gets a bit tiresome away from it (at least the rescue mission in Czechoslovakia that caps this movie is far briefer than the post-graduation affair drama in the second half of 'Benjamin'). Murray is in fine form here, though not quite as inspired as his slob from 'Caddyshack' or his deadpan wiseacre from 'Ghost Busters'--consider his character here to be a cross-section of those two types--and Ramis achieves a laidback poignancy when reacting to his friend's quips and shenanigans, while the rest of the cast get their moments here and there; Oates and Dunn stand out as the hard-bitten drill sergeant and an unhinged recruit named Francis respectively. Oates is so good, in fact, that the film suffers when he disappears for a long chunk of the movie and the screenplay is at its sloppiest (and sleaziest, as the mud wrestling bar scene will attest). Diverting enough to be enjoyable despite its weak patches, it's probably fitting that a movie about disorderly cadets needed a little more discipline to really work. Features numerous soon-to-be-popular-actors in early roles, including Reinhold, Larroquette, and Bill Paxton (blink and you'll miss him next to Candy in the bar).62/100",6,2,3,26 August 2019

","Directed by Jordan Peele. Starring Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph, Evan Alex, Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker, Madison Curry, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. (R)Writer/director Peele's follow-up to his Oscar-winning 'Get Out' is a similarly social issue-minded horror film with a heavy dose of character-rooted comic relief; it's not quite as impressive an achievement as his debut, but it proves that he's the real deal as a filmmaker. While vacationing, Nyong'o and her family take a trip to a beach where she experienced a traumatic event as a child; the adage about being unable to bury the sins of the past definitely applies here. Bursting with ideas on race and class (and the privilege and identity attached to both), teasing at the clich√©s of scary movie tropes while giddily embracing them at the same time. Nyong'o is terrific in the dual role of the terrified but fierce mother hen and the...something else; Duke and Heidecker provide most of the laughs. Not all the peculiar world-built incident threads resolve or pay off satisfactorily (or even make clear sense), but as with 'Get Out,' it's a movie that improves on revisit so that everything can be viewed from different angles with forethought and refocused attention.80/100",8,2,4,19 December 2019

Starring Dan Fogler, Christopher Walken, James Hong, George Lopez, Maggie Q, Thomas Lennon, Aisha Tyler, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Jason Scott Lee, Diedrich Bader, Robert Patrick, Terry Crews, Patton Oswalt. (PG-13)Disgraced ping pong hotshot Fogler is lured out of retirement by the FBI to help infiltrate a clandestine high-stakes tournament held by nefarious crimelord Walken. Dopey but shambolically amiable comedy is hit-or-miss all the way, but contains enough laughs in between the lazy stretches to be classified as a guilty pleasure. Walken, in a number of outrageously silly costumes, can be funny in his sleep (and even be funny because it seems like he's half-asleep at times), while Hong is delightful as the blind teacher with head-scratching nuggets of wisdom. Fogler unsuccessfully leans into Jack Black territory sometimes and the tired story beats are struck with sloppy predictability, but if you're looking for clever joke-writing and deep relationships in a movie called 'Balls of Fury,' blame must be shared both ways.57/100",6,0,0,16 August 2019

(PG-13)When the rich patriarch (Plummer) of a family of avaricious eccentrics dies (by suicide, it appears), private detective Craig--replete with a thick Southern drawl ('CSI: KFC,' per Evans)--is on the case, trying to figure out what really happened and why. Entertaining mystery with a heavy dose of humor and social commentary keeps the twists coming at a fairly consistent clip throughout, modernizing the classic Agatha Christie-style potboiler without sacrificing the elegance and idiosyncrasies (wealth aside, this is not a family one would like to be a part of). Some of the surprises can be guessed pretty easily, others may prove challenging, but it's great fun no matter how good a sleuth the viewer is. Well-cast, with Craig, Collette, Curtis and de Armas being the standouts; because of the size of the ensemble, it's not always easy to keep everyone sorted out in relation to where they all fit on the family tree and beyond, but like solving a mystery, it all becomes clear by the end. Despite saying only a handful of words throughout the entire movie, Callan steals most of her scenes by virtue of vacant gaze alone.83/100",8,3,6,9 December 2019

(R)Close to 25 years since their last collaboration, director Scorsese and actor De Niro re-team for an examination of mob hitman Frank Sheeran, with particular attention paid to his relationship with infamous Teamsters president, Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino). Story spans nearly fifty years, presented in flashback layers, reminiscences from a retirement home in the early 2000s--in contrast to the typical practice of using younger actors and caking on the makeup later on, the veteran actors here are de-aged using digital effects to play their younger selves. Scorsese and De Niro certainly know the gangster movie territory, though this one is far more restrained, introspective, and melancholy than the director's past genre efforts; fitting, considering the way its told and where on their career timelines the effort falls (not just for Scorsese and De Niro, but the supporting players as well--Pesci even came out of unofficial retirement to play crime boss, Russell Bufalino). The elegiac pace is necessary for the material, and it's a treat to watch the director play with the powerhouse cast, but the length is a bit indulgent, especially after Pacino's exit. The culmination of wreckage in a lifetime, however, has rarely been felt so eloquently, and it would be an appropriate career capper should the director never make another feature film--here's hoping that's not the case, however.88/100",9,0,3,23 December 2019

","Directed by Woody Allen.

(R)Former professional tennis player Meyers enjoys the posh trappings of life while dating the sister (Mortimer) of a former classmate (Goode) from a wealthy London family, but becomes obsessed with Goode's sexy American girlfriend Johansson; this can only end badly. After several years of disappointing efforts, Woody enters rare full-blown drama territory, even employing suspense elements out of a Hitchcockian thriller, and pulls it off superbly. Criticized in some circles for its lack of 'English authenticity' (the plot was originally intended to take place among the elite in the Hamptons), but this is a universal tale for most Western cultures, dovetailing its opening statement on the fickle impact of luck towards the end in a nicely surprising way. Makes good use of Meyers' typical detached blandness to expose moral degradation in the face of selfish compulsions, and even if the characters are sometimes shallowly observed, they find themselves at the service of the efficient machinery of a plot that resists idiosyncrasy. Applies the opera recording of 'Una furtiva lagrima' ('A furtive tear') as a recurring motif to haunting effect.85/100",8,0,0,7 May 2020

","Directed by James Cameron. Starring Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Earl Boen, Bess Motta, Rick Rossovich, Dick Miller. (R)In arguably his most iconic role, Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast as a cyborg sent back in time from a post-nuclear holocaust future to kill the mother (Hamilton) of the leader of the human resistance; Biehn is the human soldier that goes back to protect her. Pulse-pounding hybrid of science fiction, action and horror set a new standard for genre filmmaking going forward; like 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior' before it (an influence on this film, per director Cameron), pic was made on a limited budget, but stretched the dollar for maximum stunt-and-special-effects spectacle. Effective blend of cold-blooded, hard-edged violence and surprisingly sensitive human interest; the characterizations may not be deep, and the paradoxes don't warrant scrutiny, but it's so fast-paced and well-made that such quibbles aren't worth worrying about. Major influence on the tech-noir style alongside 'Blade Runner,' and firmly put its young, ambitious director on the map. Bill Paxton has a bit part as a street punk.

Clumsy storyline full of plot-holes and confusing 'rules' populated by unexciting, ill-defined characters with a series of third act climaxes that drag on and on, yet its major failure is in the nearly non-stop parade of cluttered, garish digital effects, a stupefying assault on the eyes (and brain, trying to process all the soupy information). It's hard to complain that it all looks so flagrantly phony--it's not a real world with real people in it, after all--but the film is set a few decades in the future, so why are the graphics so outdated even by current PC/console standards? Exists solely as a pellet feeder for nostalgia and pop culture references (ooh, there's the time-traveling DeLorean...hey, I've played 'Halo'...oh, did you spot the Gremlins?), but rarely with any context or substance to warrant interest. One can find the occasional appreciable moment (a few wry lines from Miller, the surprising use of the Chucky doll as a weapon, etc.), but sorting through the chaotic farrago to find them isn't really worth the taxing effort.31/100",3,3,5,5 October 2019

(PG-13)Overlong, overfamiliar, but adequately enjoyable Spider-Man adventure is both a second reboot in about half-a-decade and a full-length installation of the character into the fringes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (this is a co-production of both Marvel Studios and Columbia Pictures); plot is both patently simple--the baddie, Vulture (Keaton), just wants to steal tech, sell weapons, and make a lot of money, nothing more--and unduly messy--Peter deals with not only superhero responsibilities and teenager anxieties but also Avengers drama. As it was with 'Ant-Man,' the lowered stakes are a relief, letting character and humor grab focus away from the chaos of enormous digital pyrotechnics; granted, not all the characters are especially interesting and the humor misses as often as it hits, but at least it probably won't give anyone a headache. Holland makes for a plucky, ingenuous Peter Parker, cracking wise more often than Maguire and Garfield combined (a little of him goes a long way--he was more tolerable as a supporting player in the third Captain America movie); Keaton does his best as the villain, but the character's motivations and back-story are too thin to make him truly menacing and memorable. Aside from the web-slinging and jesting, Spider-Man is a different entity here: younger than usual, wearing a high-tech Spidey suit with its own AI (Connelly), crushing on someone besides Gwen Stacy or MJ, and so on. Similarly, the characteristics of nearly every supporting character (Aunt May, Vulture, Flash, Mary-Jane-but-not-really, etc.) hardly resemble those of their classic counterpart from the comics. Several stars of prior MCU films make appearances, some in supporting roles, some in cameos.63/100",6,0,0,17 October 2019

(PG)Third and final film in the original 'Star Wars' trilogy opens with an effort to free Han Solo from the clutches of gangster Jabba the Hutt, then sends the heroes on a mission to confront Darth Vader and destroy the newly rebuilt Death Star. Visually spectacular outing has oodles of creativity, sensational special effects, child-like wonder, technical credits to put most other crews/films to shame, but it lacks the dramatic fireworks it strives for and mishandles its own priorities by stranding most of the main characters on a forest moon for half the film, far from the 'real action' in the stars above. Performances lack zip (clunky dialogue does them no favors) and, cute as they may be, far too much time is spent with those furry little woodland teddy bears called Ewoks. The climactic lightsaber duel is underwhelming compared to the one in 'The Empire Strikes Back,' but the space station assault, despite having a familiar ring to the climax of 'Star Wars,' is still the most exciting and well-staged space battle the franchise has yet produced. A comedown after the heights of the first two episodes; nevertheless, a sporadically-frustrating-yet-generally-satisfying wrap-up.77/100",8,0,1,13 December 2019

(PG-13)Using the thinnest strands of logic possible, Johnson recruits Diesel, Walker, and crew into carrying out a dangerous mission to take down a merc outfit led by former SAS officer Evans; Diesel also discovers that his girlfriend (Rodriguez) is still alive, despite being killed off in 'Fast & Furious' (which was the fourth one in the series, so they say). Perhaps the dumbest outing yet (who's keeping track?) but also perhaps the most fried-brain-cell entertaining just for taking place in a parallel dimension where motivation, physics, logistics, and coherence are outlawed under penalty of death--or vehicular repossession, which would be a worse fate for these gearheads. The action is, as one would expect, even more outrageously insane than ever before, throwing in a smashed car tethered to a tank as it rolls down the highway and an out-and-out assault on a quadjet as it barrels down the world's longest runway. Dialogue is thuddingly awful (and sometimes barely even intelligible), performances marginally competent at best, blah blah blah, who cares; it's all about testosterone, adrenaline, shiny cars, flexed muscles, and impossible stunts. Hard to call any of this nonsense 'exciting' (certainly not 'pulse-pounding'), but there's cheesy fun to be had, even if one is a little ashamed about it afterward.

Starring Sergi L√≥pez, Maribel Verd√∫, Ivana Baquero, Ariadna Gil, √Ålex Angulo, Manolo Solo, Doug Jones, Ivan Massagu√©, Roger Casamajor, C√©sar Vea, (voice) Pablo Ad√°n. (R)Trapped in war-torn Spain during the mid-40s with a sickly and pregnant mother (Gil) and a sadistic Francoist captain stepfather (L√≥pez), young Baquero retreats from the horrors of real life into a fantasy world with threats and terrors of its own. Del Toro's adult fairy tale parable is supremely atmospheric and imaginative, filled with vividly mysterious locations, beautifully monstrous creatures, and a magic spell cast with palpable, skin-crawling physicality rather than the ethereal elusiveness that often colors such flights of fancy. His most impressive feat, however, is the ease with which he weaves the otherworldy elements into the central narrative conflict of anarcho-communist rebels fighting against fascist rule; either side of reality could have easily been cheapened, but the careful parallels and intertwining action form a remarkable symbiosis contained by the barriers of the fable. Dark and sometimes graphically violent, it is not a fantasy for children (unless they are especially stalwart), but the compelling storylines, fine performances, and glorious visuals should make all but the most hardhearted and cynical adults believe in fairies just as much as the open-eyed heroine.90/100",9,3,4,23 December 2019

","Directed by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Ed Sanders, Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener, Sacha Baron Cohen, Laura Michelle Kelly. (R)Dark but dazzling adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler musical infuses the Grand Guignol with toe-tapping melody, an operatic tragedy with the cold steel of a slasher and the pounding heart of a hopeless romantic. Burton didn't seem a likely candidate to ever helm a snazzy song-and-dancer, but who else but him could bring this deliciously sordid story to life on the big screen? By dropping much of the dancing and group choruses and focusing on intimate musical performances driven by the plot, emotions, and inner thoughts of the characters, Burton does what few movie musicals ever have: near-total immersion in the (heightened) reality of the narrative. Strong production values (set designer Dante Ferretti already knew a thing or two about infernal urban slop of the 19th century with 'Gangs of New York') and top-notch casting of the leads--not to mention a memorably flamboyant turn from Cohen as a rival barber--make up for the occasional lull and a few too many unvaried throat slittings. In both their performances and the characters they play (equally insipid), Bower and Wisener's would-be-lovers spoil the ghoulishly glorious fun almost every time they show up, but it's a small price to pay for the opportunity to see Depp show more affection for shiny straight razors than for Carter's aroused meat pie vendor downstairs. Per Sondheim, the only film version of his work that has his approval.81/100",8,1,1,6 March 2020

","Directed by David Ayer. Starring Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez, Jared Leto, Cara Delevingne, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Scott Eastwood, Karen Fukuhara, Adam Beach. (PG-13)Deadshot (Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), and a bunch of other nasties with no more than one or two provided character traits are assembled to take down an even nastier entity, an archaeologist (Delevingne) possessed by an evil sorceress; no bets will be taken over whether or not there's a sky-beam during the climax. Ignoring the illogical premise of a team of supervillains being used for dangerous black ops missions, this overstuffed movie can't decide on just about anything: its tone, its visual style, its narrative direction, its very reason for existing. A soundtrack full of pop songs, a series of incoherent fights, and the occasional 'cool guy pose' and wisecrack does not a good film make. Limp storytelling and erratic action filmmaking is (sadly) almost expected for an enterprise like this, but it's also atrociously conceived and constructed, a blare of chaotic sound mixing and spastic scene transitions that confuses frothing freneticism with heart-pounding excitement. Aside from Robbie, who is just unpredictably zany enough to really wish she and her character were transplanted to a different project, the cast is either completely wasted (Smith, Davis, etc.) or completely misconceived (Leto, Delevingne, etc.). Won an Academy Award for its makeup, which means it has one more Oscar than '12 Angry Men' does. Includes a few cameos from actors in their 'Justice League' roles.23/100",2,1,1,29 January 2020

","Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Robert De Niro, Cybil Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keitel, Peter Boyle, Leonard Harris, Harry Northup, Norman Matlock, Steven Prince, Martin Scorsese, Richard Higgs, Joe Spinell. (R)Blistering, brilliant portrait of an isolated, socially-awkward NYC cab driver and Vietnam veteran, Travis Bickle (De Niro), and his slow descent into madness as the world continually rejects him. The urban nightmare of alienation from which he can never wake is perfectly (therefore, repellently) captured by both director Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader, effectively complemented by Bernard Herrman's jazzy score fragmented by dissonant brass and shards of noise (the legendary composer's final work before his death). Culminates in a brutally violent 'avenging angel' incident, but it's arguably even tougher to watch Bickle's uneasy and even humiliating interactions with those he tries to connect with; even the camera slides away at one point to focus on something, anything else. The cast is uniformly superb, including Foster's underage prostitute, Brooks in his first film role, and even Shepherd, who has limited range and versatility as an actress, but is well-suited for the material here; as for De Niro, he gives one of his finest performances (in a career full of great ones), frightening and tragic and mesmerizing, a mind and soul deteriorating right before our eyes. One of the most unforgettable films of the 1970s, if not all-time.98/100",10,1,1,26 October 2019

Grant, Kelly Marie Tran, Keri Russell, Domhnall Gleeson, Mark Hamill, Lupita Nyong'o, Dominic Monaghan. (PG-13)Conclusion of the so-called 'Skywalker Saga' in the Star Wars universe opens at a breathless pace and rarely slows down for genuine character interaction or explanation on the way to its massive climax. Sleek and sprawling, well-acted by its diverse cast (particularly Ridley and Driver), studded with small surprises--and a couple of big ones--though the narrative is clearly manufactured inorganically so it can cover all bases and generate familiar, even conventional satisfaction. The action scenes are zippy, though they sometimes lack clarity, and the anticipated lightsaber showdown does not disappoint; logic and physics, meanwhile, are sometimes ignored completely for the sake of emotional cues and high drama. Rather than push the boundaries like 'The Last Jedi' did--the filmmakers seem intent on undoing a lot of the good things (and some of the bad) set up by Rian Johnson--Abrams and company prefer playing it safe, and it sometimes feels as much a 'greatest hits' effort as John Williams' series-cycling score. Yet the film still provides numerous thrilling moments, touching moments, sequences to celebrate and ones to make eyes pop and jaws drop. Flaws and all, there's a lot to unpack, a lot to debate, a lot to frustrate, and a lot to cherish; a strangely fitting farewell for a franchise as bumpy and rollicking as this one.70/100",7,2,8,25 December 2019

(PG)Adaptation of J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel about his experiences during World War II. Spoiled, airplane-obsessed British lad (Bale) lives a pampered, sheltered life in Shanghai, but when the Japanese invade, he gets separated from his parents and has to survive many hardships, first on the streets and then in an internment camp. An ambitious epic, but one without much focus or a clear statement; the first hour is often effective, but the movie drags during the more muddled final hour. Despite a good performance, Bale's character doesn't garner much sympathy even as he overcomes the expected coming-of-age and loss-of-innocence hurdles. Even more emotionally distant than Spielberg's previous stab at 'big, serious filmmaking' ('The Color Purple'), it's an extraordinary true story given a rather ordinary treatment in all ways but the professional polish. At the very least, this is a magnificent looking film with fine period detail, but it's sometimes wasted; like John Williams' heavy-handed score, if the movie had earned its stirring grandeur, Allen Daviau's beautiful photography would have served a greater purpose. Although a familiar cynical-but-resourceful type in POW/prison movies (think: William Holden in 'Stalag 17'), Malkovich's characterization is the most diverting.52/100",5,2,2,28 December 2019

","Directed by Clint Eastwood. Starring Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Luke Grimes, Jake McDorman, Cory Hardrict, Navid Negahban, Keir O'Donnell, Kevin Lacz, Sam Jaeger, Kyle Gallner. (R)Potent but controversial story of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (based on the memoir he wrote with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice), who served four tours of duty in the Iraq War and became the deadliest sharpshooter in the history of the US military. Director Eastwood's patented plain-spoken style may not be the most effective voice for this material, which conveniently smooths over most of the thornier aspects of its protagonist's personality and viewpoint; embellishing or outright manufacturing antagonists may work for the sake of rooting interest during the chaos of modern warfare, but it only serves to stake its flag further in the field of belief that the Iraqi people were one and all enemy 'savages.' Touches on (and glosses over) a number of issues beyond the battlefield, such as the moral quagmire of the Iraq War and the physical debilitation/PTSD suffered by vets returning from war; the most interesting part of the story actually takes place after Kyle comes home from his final tour of duty, but those details are rushed over to get to the awkwardly-assembled but unsettling final day of Kyle's life. The efficient precision of the filmmaking and Cooper's strong central performance are commendable in service of its limited mission statement; blunt as a bullet, but that may be enough for most audiences, who turned the film into a surprise box office smash.

Jackson, Christopher Lee, Temuera Morrison, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Silas Carson, Pernilla August, Jimmy Smits. (PG)Continuation of the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy begins with assassination attempts targeting Senator Amidala (Portman); a now-young-adult Anakin (Christensen) is tasked with keeping her safe--falling in love in the process, natch--while Obi-Wan (McGregor) chases clues to the conspiracy behind those murderous efforts. Large-scale production with all the digital bells and whistles money can buy, but lacks suspense during the action scenes and intrigue during the investigation; 'middle chapter' fatigue sets in once it becomes clear that they're just bridging the gap between the introductory movie that preceded it and the climactic outing to come. Periodic bursts of imaginative visuals and noisy excitement are steamrolled by weak plotting, uninteresting characters and banal dialogue. The performances are mostly sub-par, too, with no romantic chemistry at all between Christensen and Portman--the mid-section of the film drags slower than a Jawa Sandcrawler whenever they're onscreen together. At least Jar Jar Binks' role has been reduced to little more than a cameo. Plus, love it or hate it, there's the bizarre fan service that is a lightsaber-wielding Yoda (Oz), springing around like a Mexican jumping bean.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, John Leguizamo, Dash Mihok, Miriam Margolyes, Paul Sorvino, Diane Venora, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Jesse Bradford. (PG-13)Shakespeare's tale of doomed star-crossed lovers is updated to the modern age, transported to the Miami-esque city of Verona Beach, and given a gaudy MTV-style makeover so it can vulgarly pander to the youth market (coming up just short of giving the couple a crass gossip-rag nickname like 'Rom-liet'). A misguided conceit resulting in a headache-inducing mess that encapsulates the words of the Bard but produces none of the poetry; it may not desecrate the text, but the dialogue rarely comes to life coming out of the mouths of this cast (Postlethwaite being the chief exception, playing Father Laurence instead of Friar Laurence...even though he's still called a friar at one point because, well, that's the sort of care that was put into this 'adaptation'). DiCaprio's star qualities can't be denied and Perrineau's flamboyance is well-suited for Mercutio, but it's all drowned in hyperactive editing, lurid camera filters, sledgehammer symbolism, and tonal whiplash. Does feature a surprisingly effective soundtrack considering the eclectic mishmash of genres--buy the CD, skip the movie. Full title is 'William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,' which is equal parts laughable and depressing, and less suitable than it would have been to release 'Jane Austen's Clueless' the previous year. M. Emmett Walsh cameos as the Apothecary; Brian Dennehy also appears briefly as Romeo's father, but he has nothing to do (most of his scenes must have ended up on the cutting room floor).36/100",4,1,2,15 April 2020

(R)After getting busted by the FBI, con artists Bale and Adams are forced to work with volatile agent Cooper so he can make additional arrests, including the mayor of Camden, NJ (Renner). Loosely based on the ABSCAM sting scandal of the late 70s, the film opens with the message: 'Some of this actually happened,' meaning that it's more honest than most other Hollywood true stories about how a lot of it has been changed, condensed and outright invented for the sake of a good show. And for the most part, it is a good show; a bit too ungainly in its narrative sprawl--encompassing not just the complex nature of the operation, but also the messy lives that the characters navigate on a daily basis (repeated scenes of jealousy get redundant after a while)--but smart dialogue and the gaudy/glitzy production maintain interest all the way. Top-notch ensemble cast delivers, especially Cooper and Adams, though the real star of the film is the men's hairstyles, some of the (intentionally) worst one would find in a major motion picture. De Niro went unbilled for his small role as a mafioso who gets involved in the swindle.80/100",8,1,1,27 January 2020

Oodles of blood, sweat, bullets and testosterone; material elevated by Alan Silvestri's propulsive score, Donald McAlpine's robust jungle photography, Stan Winston's striking creature design. A shame that cast member Shane Black didn't punch up the unremarkable script, but director McTiernan keeps things moving (and pulses pounding) skillfully; he'd follow this up with 'Die Hard' the following year and 'The Hunt for Red October' in 1990, an unbroken run that puts the entire careers of most other action helmsmen to shame.80/100",8,0,1,7 August 2019

(R)The 'This Is Spinal Tap' rock mockumentary style is updated to the modern age when dance pop and hip-hop dominate the charts; Samberg plays Connor4Real, an industry superstar dealing with the fallout of the release of his heavily-hyped album to dismal reviews and sales. Raucous, fast-paced comedy throws everything it can at the dartboard and sees what sticks, be it incisive satire, sly insider jabs, deadpan one-liners, knowingly dumb gags, or gross-out vulgarity. As a result, sloppy at times and uneven overall, but it's admirably relentless and generates more than enough laughs (even the shameful kind) to ultimately succeed in style. Serving as actors, producers, writers and directors, it's Samberg, Taccone and Schaffer's show--they of Lonely Island fame--but they share the wealth with their co-stars, including a galaxy of celebrity cameos from both the film and music industries, often playing themselves.

(PG-13)Extravagant biopic on the life of Howard Hughes (about twenty years worth, anyway): aviation trailblazer, Hollywood director, womanizer of Tinseltown starlets, and eventual obsessive-compulsive recluse. Scorsese proves again his mastery of filmmaking technique and storytelling, crafting a sensationally vast and detailed world (with the help of superb talents like editor Thelma Schoonmacher, director of photography Robert Richardson, art designer Dante Ferretti, and many more) and using plenty of the ol' 'movie magic' to make the presentation stylized yet remarkably authentic (even employing recreations of two-strip and three-strip Technicolor to represent different periods). However, unlike most of Scorcese's other rich central-figure character studies (from Jake LaMotta to Jesus Christ), there doesn't seem to be a prevailing thesis or attitude to the subject; should Hughes be admired, pitied, scorned, championed, etc.? The cast, populated by many famous faces in roles both small and large, rarely disappoints; it was DiCaprio's best work since 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape,' and aside from coming off a bit cartoonish during her early golf game scene, Blanchett is just about perfect as Katharine Hepburn (and won her first Oscar for it).89/100",9,0,0,16 August 2019

","Directed by Bryan Singer & Dexter Fletcher. Starring Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazello, Aidan Gillen, Allen Leech, Aaron McCusker, Tom Hollander, Mike Myers. (PG-13)Superficial (and largely artificial) biopic of rock band Queen from their early 70s roots in London up to their famous 1985 Live Aid charity performance. Focus falls heavily on frontman Freddie Mercury; so much so that Brian, Roger and John barely register anything that even remotely resembles individual personalities. Countless cornball moments along the way such as offering 'origin stories' of big radio hits and Myers' obnoxiously wink-wink anti-'Bohemian Rhapsody' routine, separated by cloying glimmers into Freddie's personal life, with dialogue that no one in real life would ever speak and clumsy approaches to most of his important relationships, to say nothing for the wince-inducing, bordering-on-offensive surface examinations of his homosexuality. Don't expect more than a little leather-clad texture, a handful of innuendos, and a cliched declamation or two; the PG-13 rating keeps the usual rock star excess on the sidelines, but neutering Freddie's sexual identity/conflict felt more like a (poor) choice on the part of the filmmakers and the awful script. Despite distracting dental prosthetics, Malek is credible in the lead role, but he only truly shines when he's performing; the film itself only comes alive during those same concert moments, especially the Live Aid finale. Better, though, to skip the reproductions and all the connect-the-dots filler in between and just watch archival footage of the real deal. A band as driven and theatrical as Queen deserves better than this rote and absurdly inaccurate coloring book of cliches.33/100",3,3,4,14 July 2019

(R)Laggard and lugubrious adaptation of the much admired comic book series by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, deemed unfilmable by many (and hard to argue against that belief based on these results). Takes place in a dreary alternate mid-80s reality where superheroes exist, Nixon is still president (and wearing distractingly awful makeup), and nuclear Armageddon is on the brink; plot is convoluted and often discarded for long passages of time to focus on side ventures and back stories, but such is the price to pay for so much slavish, myopic reverence for the source material. Snyder's fascistic pop-art sensibilities seem like a good fit on paper, but paper is where the story should have stayed; though there are occasional eye-popping images, the action is flashy but repetitive and unengaging, the moral pontificating is flatulent, the music cues are ham-fisted, and the pace can best be described as 'torpor deco.' Only Haley and Morgan leave an impression in the cast (unless you count Crudup's big, blue CGI privates). The point is made early and often, then drags on and on and on (and on) for nearly three hours...but, hey, there's a director's cut out there that adds almost another half hour.33/100",3,3,4,4 April 2020

A gut-wrenching film, but also one about the triumph of the human spirit; there may not be a dry eye in the house when John Lennon's 'Imagine' is fittingly played over the final scene. A non-professional when he was cast, Ngor lived through similar events in his own life (with an even more harrowing outcome), and he's pretty much perfect in his Oscar-winning role.

Simmons, Ciar√°n Hinds, Joe Morton. (PG-13)Turgid time-waster aims to do for DC what the Avengers did for Marvel, but while Marvel's all-star smackdown was less a home run than a solid base hit to left, Justice League is simply a strikeout where the batter's pants fall down after missing the swing. While struggling to cram several new superheroes (as well as one of the most generic and forgettable villains to ever appear in a major comic book film) into a movie that runs less than two hours, the story is so rushed and fragmented that it often makes little sense, and it's a chore to even pretend to care about the film's raison d'√™tre MacGuffin (boxes of power, or some such nonsense, a concept already done to death by Marvel, Transformers, and so on). Miller manages a few chuckles as the Flash, but his character rides name recognition only, and his hero-in-action sequences are just a rehash of Quicksilver's twaddle in the X-Men movies. Meanwhile, Affleck broods and grumbles halfheartedly, Gadot poses more than acts, Cavill cashes his paycheck, Momoa plays a gym rat version of the Little Merman, and so on. Even as a sensory-assaulting stew of eye candy, it fails to deliver excitement; it wouldn't have helped if the action had been directed/edited with more than the scintilla of skill on display here since the special effects are an ugly, cartoonish swamp. Much has been made of Cavill's rubbery alien mouth, but even more annoying is how literally half the film looks like cut scenes from a PS3 title. I wouldn't want to play such an uninspired mess of a video game; watching one on the sidelines is even more of a chore.22/100",2,2,6,12 July 2019

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck, Paul Anderson, Duane Howard, Arthur Redcloud, Kristoffer Joner, Lukas Haas, Brendan Fletcher, Melaw Nakehk'o, Vincent Leclerc. (R)Story of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), real-life frontiersman guide who is horrifically mauled by a bear, witnesses the murder of his half-Pawnee son (Goodluck) at the hands of a trapper (Hardy), and is left for dead by the same man. The tenacity he uses to survive and persevere in the wilderness is rooted in an almost supernatural demand for vengeance--the title refers to someone who has come back from the dead with a dreadful purpose. A strikingly beautiful yet doggedly uncompromising film, dominated by I√±√°rritu's scorching but desolate vision, Emmanuel Lubezki's stunning photography (the untamed wild has rarely looked so gorgeous yet threatening at the same time), and DiCaprio's physical, mostly silent performance of a haggard obsessive who survives only for retribution (all three won Oscars for their work). A grueling experience at two-and-a-half hours where credibility is stretched at least one time too many for the sake of narrative convenience, but unforgettable no matter one's opinion. Loosely based on historical record, through the true story is even more amazing (if less dramatically satisfying) than the one on screen!87/100",9,1,3,17 November 2019

(PG)Ambitious animated adaptation of the Miles Morales storyline in the Spider-Man universe centers on an Afro-Latino teen taking over as the webslinger after the death of Peter Parker, as well as the introduction of a multiverse concept where myriad spider-centric heroes from different dimensions appear in NYC (including, among others, a perky, anime-styled Peni Parker and Peter Porker, aka Spider-Ham). Dazzling production is as close to one-of-a-kind as feature-length animated films go, combining hand-drawn and computer animation in exciting, fluid ways; it's always great to look at. Unfortunately, the story itself is often plodding, obvious, and illogical (despite the positive message it's delivering) in all the ways that hinder many modern superhero movies, and the over-extended climax is more noisy and chaotic than visceral and rousing. The voice work is uniformly good while Mulaney, Glenn and Cage's characters are the scene-stealers, but they are sadly underutilized; spin-off, anyone?70/100",7,0,0,29 July 2019
Duck Soup," Duck Soup (1933)
","Directed by Leo McCarey. Starring Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Zeppo, Raquel Torres, Edgar Kennedy, Charles Middleton, Leonid Kinskey, Edmund Breese.Inspired irreverence aplenty in the Marx Brothers' last picture with Paramount (before moving to MGM); considered by many to be their finest and most sustained cinematic effort. Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, dictator of tiny, impoverished nation of Freedonia, dealing with the duplicitous ambassador (Calhern) of neighboring Sylvania and his two bumbling spies (Chico, Harpo), who would be accused of treason for switching sides so often if not for the fact that they don't have a loyal, sensible bone in their bodies. Plentiful unforgettable bits: 'This Country's Going to War' musical number, Harpo and Chico torturing the poor lemonade vendor, the mirror scene, etc., to say nothing for Groucho's endless, twisting wisecracks and double entendres, which come so fast they're easy to miss (repeat viewings are a must). Considered today a top-notch political farce in the vein of 'Dr. Strangelove,' yet the satirical edge is almost 'accidental'--the Marx Brothers were just doing whatever they could to get laughs. Zeppo's role is even more insubstantial than usual here--it was his final outing with the team.94/100",9,0,1,17 September 2019

(R)Dismal but strangely fascinating meditation on the oppressive, nigh-casual growth of evil, from a director who has often presented a worldview of renunciation. Set in a small German village shortly before the start of WWI, the townspeople are at a loss over a series of seemingly random but methodical incidents of violence; loyalties split between the Baron's (Tukur) seat of power and the Pastor's (Klau√üner) seat of influence furrow resentment and cause rifts of blame; the innocence shallowly represented by white ribbons cuffed to children gets smothered by the stern moralizing of the authoritarians. Its arm's-length approach to the material diminishes its resonance, especially at nearly two-and-a-half hours of gloom on the cusp of monotony. Regardless of the reductive qualities of its chilly mechanism, the film's point is clear while evading an emotionally satisfying conclusion (this ain't a whodunnit begging for a dramatic reveal during the final reel). Even those who are put off by its observational remoteness should find the gorgeous cruelty of Christian Berger's photography too incredible to dismiss.77/100",8,0,1,25 April 2020

(PG-13)The FBI and LAPD send Walker undercover to infiltrate a crew of racing enthusiasts that pulls off highway heists, ends up befriending their leader (Diesel) and getting romantically involved with his sister (Brewster). So...'Point Break' with fast cars replacing surfboards, except this one might actually be even dumber (plus, director Cohen is no Kathryn Bigelow). Drive-in fodder souped up for exploitation cinema's modern era; would eventually spawn a long-running franchise, but in retrospect, feels refreshingly quaint, even grounded. Granted, the script ignores logic and reality at regular intervals, but the stakes are reasonably low and the stuntwork usually seems to exist in the real world. Ardent fans of shiny cars and street racing will probably enjoy it to some degree; for anyone else, it's no better than a way to kill time and appreciate the absence of Tyrese Gibson's witless-cisms. Rapper Ja Rule has a bit part and also contributes a song or two to the ear-splitting soundtrack.45/100",4,1,3,31 January 2020

(PG-13)Unsuccessful singer-songwriter Patel is considering hanging it up despite earnest encouragement from best friend and manager James; one collision with a bus later, and he comes to in a world that somehow does not have the music of the Beatles in it (nor Coca-Cola, cigarettes, and a few other things). Performing the Beatles tunes from memory--and claiming them for his own--suddenly he's a music star on the rise. Strange premise, pregnant with possibilities; pity that writers Richard Curtis and Jack Barth weren't all that interested in exploring them deeply, and decided instead to present a genteel rom-com fantasy with Fab Four wallpaper. Pleasant enough, but dishearteningly unambitious, with so many questions left unanswered, and so many missed opportunities for commentary, satire, speculation, profundity and/or pathos; the cop-out ending leaves a half-dozen or so plot threads dangling and brushes past a mountain of consequences. The leads are solid, with just enough dim spark between them for rooting interest in their romance; McKinnon's eccentric music manager might have been funny in a different project, but she sticks out like a sore thumb here.

(PG-13)Three hour payoff for the days-long superhero movie parade that came before (twenty-one releases total, but is anyone really grasping to, say, the second Thor movie for continuity?); it certainly opens better than 'Avengers: Infinity War' by virtue of its start-off point--rather than dizzily jumping through several reckless storylines and dozens of characters right off the bat, it starts at an elegiac pace, re-establishing the few survivors and reflecting on the loss and ruin that has shattered so many of their lives. Then it's down to the effects-driven action business--fetch quests aplenty and a colossal final battle. Convoluted at times, unevenly paced throughout, and a bit heavy on the illogical fan service and curtain calls, it's still a movie destined to satisfy its target audience (as crowd-pleasing a crowd-pleaser as there has ever been). Assembly-line in nature, but crafted with more love and pathos than the average product, it may not be able to escape its status as 'blockbuster punctuation,' but at least it provides a sense of closure that previous Marvel Cinematic Universe entries often lacked. The actors, from the major players to the cameos, all do solid work, far more grounded than one would expect from comic book cinema; for some, it will be their swan song, so it's nice to see them go out on top.69/100",7,0,2,28 January 2020

Starring Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, David James, Vanessa Haywood, Mandla Gaduka, Louis Minnaar, William Allen Young, Eugene Khumbanyiwa, Robert Hobbs, Kenneth Nkosi, Marian Hooman. (R)Ambitious, allegorical science fiction film presents a Johannesburg that houses (imprisons) a large group of aliens that arrived on Earth a few decades earlier inside a large, walled district that has the appearance of ghetto slums in a warzone. Presentation of xenophobia through apartheid parallels is on the nose enough to be heavy-handed, but it's still a good message, ripe for blistering commentary that shines through the more thoughtful first act, less so during the action-heavy final act. Copley's irresponsible diplomat is an unlikable protagonist who doesn't particularly earn redemption, but at least the characterization shakes off the easy mantle of the 'white savior' device. Creative and well-mounted production, assembled in a style that mixes faux-documentary talking heads, found footage, and traditional filmmaking; it's just a shame that they didn't follow through on those sharp, funny and tragic early scenes that held the promise of greatness.

(R)With her personal and professional lives in disarray, Wiig is about the last person anyone would want to coordinate their wedding plans and festivities, but that's precisely what best bud Rudolph does after getting engaged and naming her the maid of honor. Hindering Wiig's efforts even further is seemingly-perfect Byrne, a 'Type A personality' if there ever was one (and a spotlight hog, to boot). Director Feig works with producer Judd Apatow (from a script by Wiig and Annie Mumolo) to create a female-driven comedy in the vein of the crass 'boy's club' comedies all the rage during the prior decade, but they only manage sporadic success. Contains a handful of solid laughs and a lot of dry stretches, overlong and too often aimless, with the darker undercurrents all but forgotten by the all-too-tidy wrap-up segments. Tim Heidecker is completely wasted in a bit part as the groom-to-be; final film for Clayburgh as Wiig's mom, who passed away before the movie's release.48/100",5,0,0,3 January 2020

(R)A writer recounts his visit to the Grand Budapest Hotel, where the owner (Abraham) describes past events that focus on the friendship between lobby boy Revolori and concierge Fiennes as they get involved in a dangerous inheritance game and the outbreak of war. Presented by writer/director Anderson in his trademark style of artfully-staged whimsy and symmetrical elegance, with greater emphasis on sophistication while being even more meticulously artificial than ever before--many filmmakers borrow, honor or parody his furbelowed trappings, but no one does it quite like him. The cast is over-loaded with talent, including bit parts for several members of Anderson's recurring troupe (Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Bob Balaban, etc.), led by Fiennes in a fabulously droll performance as the dryly-witted and mirthfully-profane M. Gustave. Those who find Anderson's work too twee and precious for their tastes aren't likely to be converted, but it's as cozy as a peapod for anyone else, with eye-popping visual delights and the sort of heartstring tugs he found with 'Moonrise Kingdom' that had often been absent in his earlier pictures.

(R)Debilitated Queen Anne (Colman) rules England in the early 1700s, though her close friend, confidante, and sometimes-lover, the ambitious Lady Sarah (Weisz), handles most of the governing duties herself. But then a new, young servant, Abigail (Stone), arrives, who reveals herself to be an even more cunning schemer for the affections and favor of the queen. Deliciously clever and witty costume drama, with moments of absurd and explosive humor that are all the more outrageous set against the ornately stuffy trappings, but it's also a fascinating study of character and rivalry among the three sharply-defined women. The most accessible (and also the least daring) of director Lanthimos' work to date--most likely, the result of him directing a screenplay he did not write himself (credited to Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara); what the film lacks in his typically outlandish conceptualization, it more than makes up for in waggishness and visual splendor. Plus, there's Stone, Colman and Weisz giving three of the most memorable performances of the year; all were nominated for Academy Awards, with Colman winning.

(PG-13)The first half of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's grand smackdown finds cosmic supervillain Thanos (Brolin) collecting infinity stones to give himself the ultimate power to wipe out half of the intelligent life in the universe. Depicting the efforts of some fifty or more characters across several storylines in both outer space and on Earth, this exhausting 'event movie' is so relentless yet dramatically diffuse that it's difficult to engage with anything besides individual moments: a snappy quip here, a brief break from the fever pitch for reflection there. Requiring the absorption of about a dozen-and-a-half prior movies to be able to clearly follow what's happening, the effort lacks proper isolation, resulting in what feels like an incomplete film (and experience); it even opens with a mise-en-sc√É¬®ne and ends on a cliffhanger. Despite two-and-a-half hours of action, most of the cast get only a few minutes of screen time to leave a mark (even major players from previous films, like Chadwick Boseman and Don Cheadle, don't manage much more than glorified cameos), but Brolin does manage to create a formidable yet conflicted--even humanized--enemy, which only makes his decisions more startling to behold. Has all the fingerprints of filmmaking-by-committee, but it should still satisfy most fans to at least some degree.64/100",6,1,3,20 January 2020

(R)Movie star on the decline, Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), and his best friend and stunt double, Cliff (Pitt), navigate a late-60s Hollywood that has left them behind and is barely even recognizable anymore; Dalton also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Robbie) while the Spahn Movie Ranch is becoming overrun with squatters under the spell of evil Charlie Manson. Director Tarantino's fetishes are on full display here (pop culture references, explosions of graphic violence, camera lingering on bare feet, etc.), but so is his mastery of storytelling, of the rhythm of dialogue, crisp and vibrant direction, and in encouraging great acting across the entire (large) cast. Those performances, particularly from DiCaprio and Pitt at the top of both of their games, aid in carrying the audience over some uneven pacing in the midsection and retrieving focus when the narrative outskirts start to ramble. An intriguing curveball in the Tarantino oeuvre: rather than capping off long, suspenseful scenes with the catharsis of sudden bloodshed, he more often than not lets the dread build and build and then hiss out like air from a balloon as the scene moves on; squirms of discomfort rather than laughs or screams for release. The unorthodox climax is bound to puzzle, infuriate, excite, divide, but whatever one thinks of it, how else was Tarantino going to send us off, and would any other director have dared to do the same?89/100",9,15,23,31 July 2019

(R)When his 'amazing' wife (Pike) disappears, aloof husband Affleck is suspected of murder, unleashing a media firestorm that captivates the community and nation at large, but truly not all is what it seems. Ice cold yet blistered in scorch marks, director Fincher does what he does best: an elegantly stylish, meticulously-crafted thriller that looks phenomenal, frame after frame, serving every dark impulse and lunatic intent, paired well with an unnerving score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that provides false reassurance. Gillian Flynn's adaptation of her own best-seller is a hysterical dark comedy, serpentine mystery, trashy potboiler, and sinister study of sociopathy all rolled into one; can't withstand much scrutiny, but many of those plot holes (particularly toward the end) actually serve the satirical calculations of its macabre delight. Every role is perfectly cast (yes, even Perry), with Affleck and Pike delivering exactly what's needed for their unforgettable lead roles, so very deserving of each other despite not belonging within 500 yards of one another--to be a fly on the wall... Calmly torpedoes any politically correct notion of misogyny, misandry, militant feminism, revenge fantasy, etc., but is still bound to upset those who demand rectitude in their lurid fiction, which makes it all the more ingeniously unsettling.89/100",9,1,1,6 February 2020

(R)Writer/director Peele's satirical horror film is incisive, thoughtful, provocative, discomforting, flat-out entertaining; one of the best feature film debuts in years. Story follows young black man Kaluuya, traveling with his white girlfriend (Williams) to meet her folks, but something is definitely off with not just her family, but the entire situation. A near-perfect balance between that which arrests and that which unsettles, keeping the audience fully invested in what's happening (primarily through humor, character development, and the turning of the plot screws) while also putting them on edge and squirming in their seats. Even if one goes into the film completely cold, there aren't too many surprise revelations, and the build-up is better than the payoff, but it's that rare instance of a movie based around twists and suspense and toying with audience expectations that actually improves on the revisit; plenty to think about and unpeel and study at different angles, details and asides that can be missed the first time around. Also added 'Sunken Place' to the modern lexicon, which is always on the lookout for the latest buzzword to mishandle and dilute.91/100",9,2,6,15 December 2019

","Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Starring Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Oscar Isaac, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks, Kaden Leos. (R)Gosling is the Driver (no other name given, except for 'kid'), a mysterious, taciturn young man who's an L.A. mechanic and stunt driver by trade, but occasionally moonlights as a wheel-man for low-lives. Then neighbor Mulligan and her son Leos enter his life, inadvertently getting him mixed up in some sordid business with the last people in the City of Angels he should ever mess with. Superior neo-noir thriller is an ultra-stylish riff on cinematic post-modernism and anti-hero crime pictures, with tense, crisply-assembled action sequences and potent eruptions of graphic violence, yet it's focused far more on mood and character than getting the adrenaline pumping. Gosling does more with controlled looks and enigmatic smirks than the handful of lines he's afforded; his understated romance with Mulligan is expressed almost entirely in their elegantly elongated gazes. Brooks, however, walks away with the movie, cast against type as a fairly soft-spoken but ruthless crime boss, geniality masking chilly menace. The emphasis on preening, existential dread does short change the narrative twists, especially in relation to Perlman's Jewish gangster character and motivations, but it's tough to care about any of that in the moment. Arthouse genre filmmaking at its purest and most viscerally impactful.90/100",9,0,3,14 September 2019

(R)Journalist Bale is given the task of discovering what happened to Rhys Meyers' androgynous glam rock star, Brian Slade (or, David-Bowie-but-not-really), an aloof cipher who disappeared from the limelight after faking his own death about a decade prior. Writer/director Haynes has created a stylish, excessive ode to the glam scene but forgot to craft an interesting story, clear attitude, or central character that's worth investigating; the plot structure is cumbersomely fashioned to echo 'Citizen Kane,' but the timeline and narrative are both so fragmented that it's a chore to try and follow. Starts promisingly, but the surreal kaleidoscope loses its luster after a while, and aside from the exciting stage presence of Curt Wild (or, Iggy-Pop-but-not-really, played by McGregor), the movie becomes a tedious drag in the back half. By the time the 'secret' is uncovered, it's tough to even care. Makes a faint effort to tether it all to the life and writings of Oscar Wilde, but that idea is as poorly formed as most others in this erratic hodgepodge. Certainly no faulting the creative costume and makeup work, though, nor the soundtrack, which is made up of great tunes from the era (covers and original recordings), and features music from Slade and Wild's bands, which are actually comprised of talented musicians like Mike Watt, Johnny Greenwood, Ron Asheton, and more.43/100",4,0,1,9 September 2019

(PG-13)Adaptation of Neil Gaiman's fantasy book about an impressionable young man (Cox) who crosses the barrier between the real world (England) and a magical land (Stormhold) to fetch a fallen star for the shallow woman he adores (Miller); that star happens to be a human-like entity in the form of Danes, and ancient witch Pfeiffer has designs on her as well, to say nothing for the scheming princes who want the gem that Danes carries and an effete sky pirate (De Niro) that captures lightning from storms. Busy and convoluted (without the interest to make it justifiable), stuffed full of skewed humor, forced whimsy, magic spells and charms, special effects, fairy tale romance, high adventure, and more...but director Vaughn lacks the light touch needed to make it work. Pfeiffer is zesty fun, Strong puts the faintest spin on his customary glowering technique, Cox and Danes are lackluster even when one of them glows with starlight, De Niro's vamping is less entertaining than simply surreal (and absent full commitment).

(PG-13)Neeson travels to Germany with his wife (a wooden Jones) and ends up in a coma after a car crash, but after waking up a few days later, no one--wife included--recognizes him or believes he is who he claims to be. Mystery thriller relies on its twists (and the suspension of disbelief required to get there) as well as Neeson's dependable presence--he even gets to 'plausibly' play both an ordinary, exasperated innocent and a formidable action hero. The secret becomes far easier to guess once Langella shows up; he and ex-Stasi agent Ganz possess a weary wisdom that nicely contrasts the slick but formulaic filmmaking. The sort of gimmicky suspenser that demands interest just to figure out what's going on, even as it becomes clearer with every passing minute and complication that it's going to be a letdown.

(R)Two British soldiers (MacKay, Chapman) are given the task of delivering a message across enemy lines to halt an attack that would cost over a thousand lives. Director Mendes' WWI drama cares naught for the politics or grand theater of war, choosing instead to focus on two individuals undertaking one mission covering less than twenty-four hours, with the camera ceaselessly following them in real time. That faux-continuous 'single shot' gimmick is a distracting one, especially in the early-going; Roger Deakins' photography is sublime as expected, and the technical mastery is undeniable (though some of the edit points are hardly seamless), but the technique trivializes character dimension and the economy of rhythm for the sake of raw, limited experience. Designed to give the viewer a down-and-dirty, firsthand look at the experiences of soldiers, never exceeding its scope beyond what the main characters can see or anticipate, but also never escaping the labors of its own ritual--visually spellbinding at times, appropriately stark and grimy, yet never fully immersive or emotionally engaging. The leads do solid work with little meat written onto the bones besides exhaustion, fear and determination; small roles for recognizable faces do little besides provide faces to recognize.67/100",7,1,2,12 January 2020

(R)Aging, low-rung Mafia hitman Lefty (Pacino) befriends and vouches for fellow hood Donnie Brasco (Depp), bringing him into his criminal family alongside capo Madsen, completely unaware that Donnie is actually an undercover fed named Joe Pistone. Based on Pistone's memoir, screenwriter Paul Attanasio and director Newell do a commendable job of taking a lot of familiar crime film elements and giving them a fresh perspective and vitality; we've seen a lot of these types before, but Lefty's sad-eyed insight is what counts. Joe's sketchy family life is undernourished--his long-suffering wife (Heche) gripes a lot about being on the verge of leaving him, and it's never clear why she doesn't--which only serves to show that his new 'adopted' family is the one dominating his life, especially his deep bond with Lefty. Driven by the two great lead performances: Depp's abstinence from his trademark quirks for an honest portrayal, troubled and anxious while finding his loyalties and behavior torn between two extremes, and Pacino's furtive angles on brotherly love and the deep melancholy instilled in a man who brags about having a name that everyone in all five boroughs knows, yet is treated like a knockaround guy by his mob superiors.

(PG-13)Picking up shortly after the events of 'The Force Awakens,' the First Order is chasing down General Leia Organa (Fisher) and the Resistance (and fuel is running low) while Rey (Ridley) tries to convince a disgruntled Luke Skywalker (Hamill) to help the cause and train her in the ways of the Jedi. If Episode 7 played it safe, this one chooses to be bold and daring, its successes more magnificent (the best cinematic presentation yet of the fractious pull between the light and dark sides, a conflicted Luke struggling to bear the weight of his doubts and miscalculations, etc.) and its failures more galling (a few rather glaring plot holes, Leia's 'Mary Poppins in Space' charade, etc.). A magnificent visual presentation, filled with kinetic action scenes and eye-catching photography, well-acted and driven by audacious ideas about razing the past to move forward and sparking hope through ultimate means. The final scene, however--far from the actions of the main characters--miffs its dramatic potential.

(R)Sibling bank robbers (Clooney, Tarantino) racing for the border take Keitel and his family hostage, their destination a scuzzy Mexican strip bar in the middle of nowhere that (unfortuitously) happens to be a den of monstrous bloodsuckers. As much a tale of two halves as 'Grindhouse' was (in half the time); for about an hour, it's a nihilistically hip Tarantino crime picture, then it transforms on a dime into a trashy vampire gore-comedy delivered in Rodriguez's in-your-face style. Modestly enjoyable junk has attitude to spare as well as some respectable blood-and-guts special effects and makeup (not to mention enough boundless creativity to negate any attempt at logic/rules-of-lore in the frenetic back end), but a little more restraint and/or better staging would have served it better. In his first role since breaking through on TV's 'ER,' Clooney proves he has the screen presence and unforced charisma to be a legitimate movie star; Tarantino doesn't fare nearly as well, but it's still one of his least obtrusive showings in front of the camera. Sultry Hayek, wearing little besides a giant snake, steals the whole movie, of course.69/100",7,0,0,12 August 2019
The Adjustment Bureau," The Adjustment Bureau (2011)
","Directed by George Nolfi. Starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Anthony Mackie, Michael Kelly, John Slattery, Terence Stamp, Donnie Keshawarz, Anthony Ruivivar. (PG-13)New York politician Damon has a 'meet cute' with winsome dancer Blunt and an infatuation sets in; however, the powers that be (in this case, a mysterious, otherworldly group called the Adjustment Bureau) cannot allow him to pursue a romance, and will do whatever it takes to keep them apart. Intriguing setup, with a well-matched pair of likable performers in Damon and Blunt, though the script often glosses over the most stimulating aspects of its existential premise to get back to more conventional storytelling devices--metaphysical implications be damned so long as two attractive people fall in love. Despite some nifty camera tricks and special effects allowing Damon to get from Yankee Stadium to the Statue of Liberty in seconds, the climactic chase lacks the visceral excitement and/or the colossal weight of free will decision it ought to have tried achieving. Liberally adapted from the Philip K. Dick tunnel-under-the-world short story 'Adjustment Team.' Several famous faces make cameos, including Jon Stewart and James Carville; Richard Ashcroft of the Verve fame contributes a couple of songs ('Future's Bright,' 'Are You Ready?').66/100",7,0,2,16 April 2020

","Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Andrew Garfield, Tadanobu Asano, Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, Issey Ogata, Yosuke Kubozuka, Shinya Tsukamoto, Ciar√°n Hinds, Yoshi Oida, Nana Komatsu. (R)After receiving word that a priest (Neeson) living in Japan has renounced his faith following torture at the hands of authorities persecuting Christians, a pair of young Jesuit priests (Garfield, Driver) travel there to find him. Scorsese and Jay Cocks' adaptation of Shusaku Endo's book (previously filmed by Masahiro Shinoda in 1971) is an examination of the power of faith and the 'silence' of God when one suffers and cannot hear or feel His/Her presence and compassion, reflective of the director's long-held struggle with his own religious ideals and beliefs. The film's deeply thoughtful austerity creates a hurtle to accepting its message--it unfolds too slowly once the priests' journey begins, and doesn't always fully engage once pivotal plot points arrive; the patient will be rewarded, however, by its lingering propositions. Vivid recreation of 17th century Japan is always gorgeous to look at (even at its most brutal); cut by Scorsese's long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, but those pacing issues (and an overlong denouement) cannot be overlooked. Strong performances from most of the cast, especially Asano and Ogata. Had long been a passion project for Scorsese, closing out an informal trilogy of faith alongside 'The Last Temptation of Christ' and 'Kundun.'81/100",8,2,2,4 November 2019
Logan," Logan (2017)
","Directed by James Mangold. Starring Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Dafne Keen, Boyd Holbrook, Stephen Merchant, Richard E. Grant, Elizabeth Rodriguez, Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal, Quincy Fouse. (R)Jackman's presumed swan song as Marvel mutant Wolverine takes place in a deteriorating near-future, the X-Men disbanded and mostly deceased, where the aging and slowly dying anti-hero has all but given up on life while caring for ailing Professor X (Stewart). Then a mysterious girl (Keen) enters his life, along with some dastardly pursuers led by shady scientist Grant and sinister merc Holbrook, and ol' Wolfie grudgingly rediscovers a purpose. The 'Shane' echoes are laid on thick, the road movie clich√É¬©s are plentiful, and the rote build-up to the climax spoils what should have been a superbly cathartic blow-out, yet there's no denying that after three attempts to give the character his own showcase, they finally got it right. Self-doubting and weary, Jackman plumbs even greater poignant depths to a character he's played numerous times before, while Stewart manages to evoke great melancholy without committing to resignation. Visceral, flesh-ripping violence may turn off the squeamish, especially when it's aimed at young Keen, but she gives as good as she gets, and it ought to satisfy all other parties to finally get to see the blood-soaked reality of Wolverine's berserker rage, cautiously neutered in earlier outings. Fans of the comic books and 'X-Men' franchise are likely to appreciate the final image.81/100",8,0,0,4 May 2020

","Directed by Ari Aster. Starring Florence Pugh, Jack Reynor, Vilhelm Blomgren, Will Poulter, William Jackson Harper, Hampus Hallberg, Archie Madekwe, Ellora Torchia, Anna √Östr√∂m. (R)Following up his take-notice debut, 'Hereditary,' director Astor tackles folk-horror alongside an emotional/spiritual awakening parable. Reeling from a family tragedy, Pugh (in an effective performance) joins her emotionally-distant boyfriend, Reynor, and three of his buddies on a trip to Sweden to take part in a midsummer festival taking place at Blomgren's ancestral home commune. Aster's mastery of subtle tension-building and lingering ideas and imagery are on full display here once more; flawed as it is, this movie sticks to your ribs and gives you plenty of things to ponder and itch about afterward, as well as numerous indelible film frames that are hard to shake. The combination of hallucinogenics and gaslighting only makes the sensation all the more eerie and discomforting for Pugh and her crew. Long but never dull, the main criticism with the movie is in the wrap-up; it's not that it's as fearlessly mad/contentious a jump as the one that occurred in the final reel of his last film, but rather it's somewhat underwhelming, especially considering how close it comes to simply ripping off another well-known folk horror movie (no spoilers, but you can probably guess). Still, while you may walk out feeling a little let down after the oft-mesmerizing first two hours, don't be surprised if the film's ideas and allegories keep filling your head for days after.82/100",8,13,33,12 July 2019

","Directed by Michel Gondry. Starring Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Tom Wilkinson, David Cross, Jane Adams, Thomas Jay Ryan. (R)Upon learning that his ex-girlfriend (Winslet) underwent a procedure to have him erased from her memories, Carrey requests that they do the same with his memories of her, but starts feeling regrets mid-removal. Original, highly inventive script (netting screenwriter Charlie Kaufman an Academy Award) is dense, dizzying, and full of clever twists and revelations, jumping back and forth not just between time periods but also between reality and imagination. Character development is limited, and its notions of love seem focused on memories of events/moments more than the deeper connections and contemplations identified in societal definitions of 'heart' and 'soul' (and its fascinations more invested in the translation of mental information than the capricious nature of emotional dominance), but so be it. Gondry matches these ideas with freewheeling visual ingenuity, Ellen Kuras' restless camera catching countless shots that will be remembered for years to come. Carrey and Winslet are both cast against type but deliver unforgettable performances, backed by a strong supporting cast. Whether it's judged as sublimely romantic or bitterly anti-romantic depends more on the eye of the beholder than the creative minds at work here.88/100",9,0,0,8 October 2019

","Directed by Neill Blomkamp. Starring Matt Damon, Sharlto Copley, Alice Braga, Jodie Foster, Wagner Moura, Diego Luna, William Fichtner, Faran Tahir, Mike Mitchell, Emma Tremblay. (R)A futuristic haves-and-have-nots tale, with the rich living in Elysium, a palatial paradise orbiting Earth, and all the rest suffering on the grungy surface of the decrepit and overpopulated planet. After ex-con assembly worker Damon gets critically debilitated by a workplace accident, he resolves to do whatever it takes to hightail it to Elysium and use one of their ultra-sophisticated med-bays (able to miraculously cure anything--from fatal radiation poisoning to leukemia--in seconds). Director Blomkamp tries his hand at the same sort of sci-fi-with-a-social-agenda as he did with 'District 9' with wildly mixed results. Art design and special effects are terrific (if familiar), Damon is a firm presence in the lead role, and its intentions are admirable. However, the class divide, labor exploitation, and immigration paranoia metaphors are slathered on with a trowel, and the over-the-top villainy belongs in a low-rent B-picture (Copley is downright cartoonish, while Foster gives a rare poor performance full of unnatural mannerisms).60/100",6,0,0,4 May 2020

Starring Johnny Depp, Heather Graham, Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson, Susan Lynch, Paul Rhys, Annabelle Apsion, Samantha Spiro, Jason Flemyng, Katrin Cartlidge, Ian McNiece, Lesley Sharp, Estelle Skornik, Joanna Page. (R)Dull, dreary variation on Jack the Ripper's Victorian-era murder spree, with Depp playing an inspector on the case who gets clairvoyant visions in opium dreams (and that's not even the silliest thing going on here). He comes to the aid of Graham (hysterically miscast as a supposedly bedraggled Whitechapel street prostitute) amid a series of gruesome murders while uncovering a bizarre conspiracy involving shadowy, privileged circles of power--anything else the filmmakers wanted to nick from Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow'? Depp seems listless enough for the audience to assume he was ingesting real opium while performing, and his sentimental romance with Graham is all the more creaky and unconvincing surrounded by the grim, Gothic trappings. Said scenery and atmosphere are among the film's few virtues, though the directors can't even get that quite right, as their showy, stylized touches don't embellish mood so much as befuddle motivation. Hardly a thrill in sight, all the way to the anti-climactic, unsatisfying conclusion; call it a penny dreadful lacking the lurid entertainment value.

Robinson Jr., Al Breneman.Legendary Billy Wilder burlesque comedy (co-written alongside I. A. L. Diamond) with Prohibition-era musicians Lemmon and Curtis going on the run in drag with an all-female band after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Well-structured and paced until the overextended home stretch, with Lemmon and Curtis in fine form (the former gets most of the best lines, the latter trots out a pretty amusing Cary Grant impersonation), despite the fact that neither one is remotely convincing as a member of the opposite sex; trouble is, it's just not all that funny, stretching its one-joke premise razor thin and lacking invention during the expected plot complications. Amusing enough to rate as decent entertainment, but its reputation as one of the funniest films of all-time is puzzling; maybe one's mileage would improve if they find men wearing women's clothes inherently funny by concept alone? At least Brown's famous final line earns its reputation.63/100",6,1,2,14 January 2020

","Directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Starring Juliette Binoche, Beno√Æt R√©gent, Charlotte V√©ry, Florence Pernel, Florence Vignon, Emmanuelle Riva, H√©l√®ne Vincent, Philippe Volter. (R)After her husband and child die in a car crash, Binoche attempts to retreat from everything she once had (house sold, husband's work destroyed, ties with her mother severed, etc.), but finds it difficult, if not impossible, to abandon her past outright. Unevenly-paced but fascinating drama is artfully lit, photographed and edited--as expected from the title, color plays an important role, with the blue motif used to memorable effect as a calming but melancholy presence. While delivering a brilliantly understated but passionate performance, Binoche dominates as a somewhat enigmatic and unsympathetic character, but those dealing with grief are often difficult and unpredictable; her prickly nature staves off the confrontational and prevents the film from becoming fully absorbing, and the striking final sequence may be a visual marvel, but not an emotional one. First part of the 'Three Colours' trilogy, each one themed from the colors of the French flag (and revolutionary motto); blue represents 'liberty,' though it is, of course, not the sort of freedom that most would ever wish for.72/100",7,1,1,7 December 2019

(PG-13)The tale of a scientist (Jackman) working on a medical discovery to save his cancer-stricken wife (Weisz), interwoven with stories set in the distant past (conquistador searching for the tree of life) and future (last living man traveling through space with a different tree, aged and dying). Spanning roughly 1,000 years (though the latter two tales are fictional within the film's universe), this ambitious sci-fi/fantasy film certainly has some striking imagery and heady ideas about resisting and accepting death, but it falls short on emotional resonance--the lead characters have little depth and are drawn as totemic by the expansive canvas--and nearly every leap into the ethereal is a soggy muddle. Jumbles various religious and philosophical traditions (New Age, Buddhism, Mayan mythology, Christian beliefs, etc.) without exploring any of them beneath the surface; might have benefited from a more comprehensive survey, but even at only about an hour-and-a-half in length, it starts to drag by the home stretch. Resembles one of those novels deemed 'unfilmable' but someone went ahead and tried anyway (except this is an original screen story).42/100",4,1,5,14 September 2019

","Directed by Todd Phillips. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Frances Conroy, Zazie Beetz, Glenn Fleshler, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Bill Camp, Leigh Gill, Sharon Washington, Marc Maron, Douglas Hodge, Bryan Tyree Henry. (R)Character study/origin story of perhaps the most famous comic book villain of all, the Joker; here, he starts out as a mentally ill, somewhat sympathetic sadsack named Arthur Fleck, but then spirals out of control and becomes a disturbingly nihilistic nightmare-in-the-flesh, inspiring cult adulation from deranged crowds of protesters. Phillips' grim, uncompromising vision aims for gritty realism, though Fleck's psychology is distracted by heightened realism and hallucinatory imagination; Phillips makes no effort to distinguish between these two states, creating a point of view that is not only unreliable but also untrustworthy. This would have been more effective if there weren't also glaring plot holes and contrivances that degrade cogency (the broadcast airing of the stand-up act, Fleck sneaking into the theater unnoticed and unrestricted, etc.). The potent violence is telegraphed in advance, rendering its shock tactics clumsy and overwrought; if there's one thing that the Joker shouldn't be it is predictable. However, the cinematic craft, design, and frame composition is all high-quality--did anyone expect Phillips ('Old School,' 'The Hangover,' et al) to have a movie like this in him?--and Phoenix's tour de force performance is attention-grabbing from his first cackle, refusing to let go even as the credits start to roll. Ambitious, flawed, harrowing, frustrating; it's as hard to conventionally 'like' this film as it is to dismiss.71/100",7,2,8,9 October 2019

(R)Survivor of her hometown slayings Sidney Prescott (Campbell), now a college student, once again finds herself the target of a murderous lunatic: a copycat killer wearing the same 'Ghostface' costume as before. Aside from a few tweaks, no one messed with the formula; sequel delivers pretty much exactly what one might expect, though it lacks the freshness of the original and the scares are milder. Fortunately, the satirical elements are just as keen, and thanks in part to the existence of a movie-within-the-movie ('Stab') based on the initial killings, there's more opportunity for sneaky meta-commentary, particularly from video store geek Kennedy. Returning characters are given even greater definition here, but there are precious few standouts among the 'fresh meat' (O'Connell's dutiful boyfriend is particularly bland). Includes a handful of cameos, including Luke Wilson, Heather Graham and Tori Spelling.67/100",7,1,1,13 March 2020

(R)Nearly three decades after the events of the first film, the now-grown members of 'the Losers' return to Derry for a reunion of grim purpose--seems that nasty, ol' Pennywise (SkarsgÏ±Örd) wasn't defeated last time, and with new young blood spilling, the time is nigh to put the fiend down once and for all. Sprawling but structurally-unsound and meandering horror story is full of hoary convolutions (including 'rules' delivered with such solemnity they can't possibly be taken seriously) and repeats scare sequences with too little variety; as in the first film, when the 'jumps' arrive, they're followed by explosive laughter instead of screams (despite SkarsgÏ±Örd's best efforts, his 'clown prince of evil' is still far sillier than it is terrifying). Only Hader really stands out among the main cast, and he provides the intentional jests to go along with the inadvertent variety; the film's potential status as an accidental comedic masterstroke, however, is spoiled by far too many profitless detours and flashback reiterations that drag this thing out close to three hours. The protracted climactic showdown provides yet another piece of evidence in the argument that gargantuan digital effects do not mix well with fright flicks. Stephen King and Peter Bogdonavich both show up in cameos.41/100",4,2,2,16 March 2020

(PG-13)Eddie Mannix (Brolin) is a tireless 1950s Hollywood fixer handling problems as customary as a director (Fiennes) complaining about a matinee idol (Ehrenreich) being inappropriate for a role, and as outrageous as a communist cell kidnapping a studio star (Clooney) for ransom money. More an assemblage of 'day in the life' vignettes than a purposeful plot, replete with fine facsimiles of classic Hollywood musical numbers (Busby Berkley and Gene Kelly, the both), Biblical epics, and plenty more; it doesn't add up to much, and some of the sub-plots can get lost in the tangle (Johansson's unwed pregnancy problem is expressed and resolved awfully easily), but it's still pretty fun. Highlights: Ehrenreich's singing cowboy playing in the sandbox of an elegant comedy of manners and Tatum's tap-dancing sailor. Nice period detail, though it's a shame the filmmakers didn't make the movies within the movie look more authentic (notably the film stock color and grain characteristics).73/100",7,0,0,9 September 2019

","Directed by Darren Aronofsky.

(R)Unflinching, fascinating study of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke), a professional wrestler a couple decades removed from his prime, barely scraping by while dealing with sustained physical pain and emotional regret. Aronofsky's raw, documentary-style approach to the material sinks the viewer deeper into the wrestler's world, utilizing evocatively shabby and grimy New Jersey locations to match the broken-down nature of its central figure. Rourke presumably drew upon his own fallen-from-grace life experience for his portrayal and gives, to forgive the clich√É¬©d plaudit, the performance of a lifetime; Wood and especially Tomei score as well, respectively playing his estranged daughter and a stripper struggling to separate her personal and professional lives (and Randy's place in both). Hard to say what's tougher to watch: the torment inflicted in the ring (including some memorably gruesome stuff involving barbed wire and staples) or the torment worn on his grizzled face as he takes stock of his life, wears the weight of so many failures, and continues the pattern of destroying that which he tries so desperately to forge and mend. Some of the plotting can be a bit predictable--the relationship with his daughter can't evade inevitability--but this movie is defined by character, setting, and mood far more than narrative progression.88/100",9,1,1,17 October 2019

(PG-13)The 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy comes to a close as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (McDiarmid) lures Anakin (Christensen) to the Dark Side, turns him against the Jedi, including his former master, Obi-Wan (McGregor). Best of the prequels is still a frustratingly uneven experience, full of bold, operatic highs and misfired, cringe-worthy lows; dialogue is still often atrocious and performances vary wildly, but at least one can feel real stakes and stirring drama as the darkness grows and tragedy looms. Portman is often sidelined in this outing, and McGregor spends a lot of the mid-section in a comparatively inconsequential sub-plot; the last hour, however, delivers the goods with only a few hiccups (the overblown battle between Yoda and Palpatine in the Senate chamber, Vader's plaintive wail, etc.). Like Darth Maul from 'Phantom Menace,' General Grievous (voiced by Wood) is an intriguing villain, but is underdeveloped and insufficiently used.

(R)Teen-aged Choi, from a lower-class, unemployed family, deceives his way into a position as tutor for the daughter within the prosperous Park family; soon, the rest of his family begins ingratiating (and insinuating) themselves into the Park's lives. To tell more would spoil the pleasures of this deliciously demented parable on class, greed, prejudice and more. As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up.

(R)Dramatized but mostly accurate account of several disparate investors that recognize a devastatingly flawed housing bubble and bet heavily against the mortgage market in the years leading up to the 2008 collapse. As much a real-world horror film as a savage comedy, the filmmakers pinpoint the corruption and hammer it home, making cynical sense out of a cynically insensible series of events. Script (by McKay and Charles Randolph, based on a non-fiction book by Michael Lewis) blends lots of economics jargon and meta-humor, and pulls off the Herculean task of triggering fascination and even entertainment from long conversations about subprime mortgages and bonds and CDO's, while also making people who earn (very comfortable) livings off of the failure of others surprisingly likable, sometimes even sympathetic. (The latter is done primarily by provoking outrage toward the fat cats who knew better and didn't care.) Cast is terrific top-to-bottom, especially Carell as a fed-up trader who lacks a verbal filter; should anyone be surprised, though, that the character who comes closest to having an admirable conscience is played by Pitt, who happens to be a co-producer? Hank Corwin's sensational editing gives the film the pace of a thriller, and it certainly is terrifying at times. One gross miscalculation: thinking it would be easier for the audience to concentrate on an investment lesson if it was delivered by Margot Robbie in a bubble bath.

(R)Oliver Stone's vivid, trenchant Vietnam War drama as seen through the eyes of Sheen's green, fresh-from-basic-training infantry volunteer (loosely based on Stone himself). During his tour of duty, he finds himself pulled in different directions by the conflicting viewpoints of two of his sergeants: the brutal, no-nonsense Berenger (with memorable facial scars) and the more agreeable, idealistic Dafoe. Transports the viewer deep into the jungle, at eye-level with the grunts, delivering a visceral experience that has rarely been equaled before or since in a war movie; narrative depicts not just the horrors of combat, but also the day-to-day misery of constant fear and anxiety in inhospitable conditions, without meaning or logic to guide their actions. Perhaps because his budget was so limited, Stone's showy and sometimes excessive directorial flourishes are nowhere to be seen--he just puts the camera down at ground level and records the chaos. Strong performances from a capable cast, large enough to include a handful of up-and-comers in small roles like Johnny Depp and Living Colour vocalist Corey Glover. Utilizes Samuel Barber's 'Adagio for Strings' piece so well that many people think that it's the film's original theme composition. Flaws in Stone's script aside (all-too-clean division within the platoon, na√É¬Øve final line, etc.), this is a film that works on the gut level--and the punch it delivers to that region--and features numerous moments of harrowing power.

Hip, blood-soaked contemporary horror film revitalized the slasher genre, updating it for a new generation haphazardly defined by glib irony. Kevin Williamson's self-aware script and Craven's veteran directorial skill serve the material well; it's an imperfect concoction, to be sure, with the occasional cheap scare tactic, head-shaking implausibility, and a tendency toward overkill during the final reel, but it's overall a sharp, funny and sporadically suspenseful venture into genre cross-breeding. Though later rehashes and self-parody has diminished the impact, its opening sequence still ranks as a true virtuoso of horror filmmaking.

(R)More accurately, 'Divorce Story' (or at the very least, 'Marriage Autopsy'); shows the detailed--and sometimes agonizing--process of spouses (Driver, Johansson) separating while struggling to remain on reasonable terms and share custody with their child (Robertson). Incisive and bitter yet deeply humane and ultimately compassionate, writer/director Baumbach has created a stirring, sharply-crafted examination of irreconcilable differences, the toll of wreckage and the shared hurt, where blame is felt, weaponized, and ultimately beclouded. It's an imperfect creation, to be sure, with certain scenes and moments that veer off course (the 'knife trick,' lawyer Dern's speech while prepping her client for court questioning, etc.), but there are plenty more sequences of raw honesty, understated power, and relatable discomfort that ring true. Driver and Johansson both give bravura performances, as good as they've ever been before, and it's a testament to the angles they choose and the confidence in the characters they portray that neither one can (or would) claim any kind of 'victory,' Pyrrhic or otherwise, once the smoke finally clears.86/100",9,6,8,23 January 2020

(PG-13)Following the death of Princess Diana, Queen Elizabeth II (Mirren) chooses to remain private, passive and dignified while the country struggles to mourn and deal with their grief; recently-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (Sheen), however, encourages her to abandon the stoicism and address her people. Surprisingly intimate portrait provides a glimpse into the private lives of the monarchy, dominated by two very effective performances (Mirren earned universal hosannas--and an Oscar--for her splendidly nuanced work, yet mannered but magnificent Sheen is nearly her equal). Benefits from Peter Morgan's insightful and gently humorous script, though some of the supporting characterizations are shaky (notably Cromwell's grouchy Prince Philip), and because the film so often focuses on the isolated, publicly aloof world of the royals, it lacks strong dramatic interest or the context of perception--even with the occasional person-on-the-street news clip, what stirred the passions of the people remains elusive to anyone who didn't live through it in Britain. Frears is always better served with venom soaked into the strings he pulls, so it can't be considered surprising (or even disappointing) that the quietly intriguing film he delivers leans closer to 'respectable' than 'spellbinding.' Definitely needed more scenes with those adorable Corgis.74/100",7,0,0,22 January 2020
Creed II," Creed II (2018)
","Directed by Steven Caple Jr. Starring Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Wood Harris, Dolph Lundgren, Phylicia Rashad, Florian 'Big Nasty' Munteanu, Russell Hornsby. (PG-13)Despite a satisfying wrap-up with closure at the end of 'Creed,' the temptation to return to the well for another go-around was too strong to ignore; fortunately, while the script reverts to formula and offers few surprises, it still works, thanks in large part to its commitment to character and heart. The premise is the sort of thing that could only exist in Hollywood: after Adonis Creed (Jordan), son of the deceased Apollo Creed, wins the heavyweight championship belt, a challenger arrives in the form of Viktor Drago (Munteanu), son of Ivan Drago (Lundgren), former opponent of Creed's trainer Rocky Balboa (Stallone) and, oh, yeah, the man who killed Creed's pop. Though the boxing scenes are competently-staged and rousing enough, it's the performances, relationships, baggage and emotion that make this a cut above the routine cash-grab sequel level--not just the well-worn ones from the prior film, but also the morose fate of elder Drago and his family after losing his mid-80s bout. Brigitte Nielsen reprises her role from 'Rocky IV' as well, though it would best be classified as a cameo.71/100",7,1,1,6 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Jojo Rabbit (2019)
","Directed by Taika Waititi. Starring Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Scarlett Johansson, Taika Waititi, Sam Rockwell, Archie Yates, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, Luke Brandon Field, Sam Haygarth. (R)In the waning days of the war, young Johannes (Davis) dreams of becoming a Nazi and serving the Fatherland--he even has Adolf Hitler (Waititi) as an imaginary friend--but he begins to have doubts after discovering a Jewish girl (McKenzie) hiding in his attic and realizing that's she's nothing like the despicable stereotypes he'd been taught about her people. Writer/director Waititi's idiosyncratic Nazi comedy is more 'daring' than 'brave,' the distinction being that he's willing to push boundaries for a nervous-but-genuine laugh, yet he still mostly stays in safe territory by not addressing the ugliest truths, and only directly dealing with darkness when plumbing for sentiment or sadness--less the black comedy or satire it appears to be on the surface than an irreverent lampoon with a reassuring heart. The whimsical nature of the humor does, however, successfully capture the absurdity of war and the ignorance of evil, and the film rarely falls short on the task of being entertaining and/or touching. Smart casting invigorates the material, even if Rockwell could do this sort of role in his sleep by now and McKenzie's youth-in-hiding is more of an emblem or prop than fully-realized character. Waititi's script won an Academy Award. Alfie Allen has a cameo.79/100",8,0,0,21 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)
","Directed by J. J. Abrams. Starring Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Harrison Ford, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Carrie Fisher, Domhnall Gleeson, Peter Mayhew, Lupita Nyong'o, Anthony Daniels, Andy Serkis, Max von Sydow, Gwendolyn Christie, Mark Hamill. (PG-13)Continuation of the 'Star Wars' saga (and start of a new trilogy) picks up a few decades after the end of 'Return of the Jedi,' bringing back old characters and introducing new ones, such as a young scav with raw but powerful force powers (Ridley), a stormtrooper who betrays the First Order (the 'new' Empire) and joins the resistance (Boyega), and the greatest pilot the good guys have who isn't established any further than just being a great pilot (Isaac). Lively, well-mounted production looks good and has energy and humor to spare, but does little in the way of innovation, and instead offers two-plus hours of nostalgia, even blatantly echoing story elements from the original blockbuster. There's also too little information filling in the gaps between episodes, and the lack of development cheapens a major death late in the film that could have been a grand, operatic tragedy if given greater accumulation and context. Still, a heartily entertaining film for fans to relish after the disappointing prequel trilogy; episodic but cohesive comfort food. Keep an eye (or ear) out for Daniel Craig's recognizable voice coming from a stormtrooper.72/100",7,1,7,17 December 2019

","Directed by Akira Kurosawa. Starring Tatsuya Nakadai, Kenichi Hagiwara, Tsutomu Yamazaki, Hideji Otaki, Jinpachi Nezu, Daisuke Ryu, Masayuki Yui, Takashi Shimura.A thief (Nakadai) who bears a striking resemblance to a warlord (also Nakadai) is hired to serve as the leader's double, but then takes the mantle himself after the warlord dies, creating an illusion that must not be broken at the risk of personal ruin and the deterioration of the clan. Kurosawa's return to feudal period dramas is a magnificent technical achievement, an epic war film and thoughtful drama brought to life with bold colors and incredible costumes and sets. The size of it all threatens to dwarf (or crush) the finer, more philosophical details, and the storytelling sometimes struggles to connect all the pieces--it is not quite on the same level of Shakespearean drama found in 'Throne of Blood' and 'Ran.' However, it's still an unshakable physical experience; unforgettable images abound, from a messenger charging through the resting ranks of several military divisions to the final image of Nakadai struggling against breaking waves and the tide, banner in sight. Film title roughly translates as 'shadow warrior'; final film of Shimura, a long-time Kurosawa collaborator.84/100",8,0,0,11 May 2020

","Directed by George Lucas. Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Cushing, Peter Mayhew, David Prowse, Alex McCrindle, Phil Brown, Shelagh Fraser, Garrick Hagon, (voice) James Earl Jones. (PG)The classic whiz-bang B-movie nucleus packaged as a headline feature, this visionary space opera/fairy tale broke the mold and changed Hollywood forever. Its central story and characterizations are straight out of tropeville (bits of 'Flash Gordon' and Edgar Rice Burroughs, a heavy dollop of Kurosawa's 'The Hidden Fortress,' and so on, to say nothing for mythologist Joseph Campbell's 'hero's journey' concept), but the trappings are a dream come true for anyone with a youthful spirit, a fantastical imagination, and a thirst for adventure. Equal parts heart and hardware, propelled by groundbreaking special effects, nicely lived-in sets and costumes, plus John Williams' unforgettable music (taking away just this one ingredient casts its staggering success in doubt); what it lacks in depth and originality, it more than makes up for in sheer exuberance of image and sound and comic-book thrills. Guinness (in the flesh) and Jones (in the pipes) stand out in the cast; Ford is a bit stiff at times, but his anti-heroic space cowboy still rates as one of the coolest hombres in cinematic history. Launched not only a boatload of theatrical sequels and spin-offs, but a whole fictional universe reaching into the realms of television, literature, video, and enough merchandise to fill a thousand warehouses.

(PG-13)With Walker firmly on the wrong side of the law now, Diesel and his 'family' hightail it for Rio where they plot to lighten a crimelord's wallet by about $100 million. Meanwhile, federal agent and bounty hunter Johnson assembles a team to extract our dopey heroes and bring them to justice. As dumb and loud as one would expect from the fifth entry of this astonishingly venerable series, it's more in the spirit of heist movies like 'The Italian Job' and 'Ocean's Eleven' than the muscle car drive-in fodder that inspired the first few pictures. Whenever it attempts even a scintilla of dramatic/emotional underpinning, take a bathroom break, 'cause the only reason to tune in is for a series of thunderingly absurd action set pieces, which are mostly pretty entertaining (the big throwdown between Diesel and Johnson, though, has zero suspense since they both give and take blows like they were Terminators). Within about five minutes of his first appearance, one would prefer getting a foot crushed under a car's tire than hear another one of Gibson's obnoxious wisecracks; in fact, just muting it altogether would be for the best, provided the viewer's mouth is hydrated enough to constantly make their own 'vroom vroom!' noises.54/100",5,1,3,3 October 2019

","Directed by Peter Farrelly. Starring Viggo Mortensen, Mahershala Ali, Linda Cardinelli, Joe Cortese, Dimiter D. Marinov, Sebastian Maniscalco, Tom Virtue, Brian Stepanek, Iqbal Theba, P.J. Byrne, Maggie Nixon. (PG-13)Tony 'Lip' Vallelonga (Mortensen), loving husband and father, wise-guy-adjacent tough guy, and casual racist, is selected to drive acclaimed black pianist Don Shirley (Ali) on an eight-week road trip through the Deep South; no need for the audience to bring the rose-colored shades since all cameras used to shoot this picture apparently had that filter on preset. Old-fashioned to the point of insult, the majority of the running time is spent in the company of both men, who 'learn' from each other and 'bond' as a result (at least they both know how to eat fried chicken by the end), although their camaraderie rarely exceeds the level of a second-rate buddy movie. It's a trial to watch good actors like Mortensen and Ali try to breathe life into one of the hokiest and most obvious screenplays for a major motion picture in several years; granted, it doesn't help that Mortensen chooses to play it too broad (the crass Italian-American stereotyping feels pulled less from reality than from sketch comedy). Ali fares a little better, but his tightly-wound but injured stoicism does not profit from the producers' decision to rarely let Shirley be onscreen without Vallelonga, depriving us of critical reactions and emotions that aren't surface-deep and observed through another character's eyes. (There's even a brief episode where it's revealed that Shirley is gay, but Vallelonga barely seems interested and the movie never brings it up again.) Focusing almost entirely on the white character wouldn't have been so problematic if Vallelonga actually showed growth and regret and changed for the better, but he's pretty much the same person he was at the beginning, just willing to accept this specific black man as slightly-more-friend-than-employer. Designed and packaged as crowd-pleasing fare, and the con seemed to work when it nabbed a Best Picture Oscar, but this is little more than a clumsy reversal of 'Driving Miss Daisy,' another inexplicable populist victor that feels a little embarrassing in retrospect.32/100",3,7,17,20 August 2019

","Directed by John Sturges. Starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, James Garner, Donald Pleasence, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Gordon Jackson, Hannes Messemer, Angus Lennie, James Coburn, John Leyton, David McCallum, Robert Graf, Nigel Stock.Classic POW film dramatizing the efforts of hundreds of prisoners to escape a German stalag during World War II. Director Sturges assembled a fine ensemble cast (including a few of the gunfighters from his earlier film, 'The Magnificent Seven'), shot it on scenic locations primarily in and around Bavaria, and oiled the machine with plenty of action, humor, suspense and pathos. No real depth or psychological interest; just terrific escapist entertainment. Based on Paul Brickhill's nonfiction book of the same name. Composer Elmer Bernstein (who had also previously worked with Sturges on 'The Magnificent Seven') provides the unforgettable score. A Hollywood crowd-pleaser, not a history lesson--though the opening disclaimer notes that changes/composites were made to the characters and timeline, it also promises that 'every detail of the escape is the way it really happened' (which is also quite inaccurate).87/100",9,2,2,10 January 2020

","Directed by Irvin Kershner. Starring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, David Prowse, Julian Glover, Kenneth Colley, Alec Guinness, (voice) James Earl Jones. (PG)Tremendous continuation of the Star Wars saga follows split storylines, with the Galactic Empire pursuing Ford, Fisher and company across the galaxy while Hamill visits the wizened Yoda (Oz) to begin his Jedi training. Superior to the already-terrific original in almost every way--darker, deeper, more involving and thought-provoking, with the sharpest dialogue and most satisfying performances from all three leads in the entire series. Any gripes about 'middle chapter syndrome' or the absence of the purity and innocence that enriched the first chapter are nullified by the majestic scope, broadening its initial mythic clarity into the realm of operatic mystery. Which isn't to say that it's not also a lot of fun, with an exciting battle on the ice planet of Hoth, Yoda's impish humor (that's sadly absent in the other chapters), a blossoming romance between Han and Leia, John Williams' 'The Imperial March' composition (from then on out, audio shorthand to announce any evil regime), scary creatures and imaginative new worlds, not to mention the infamous revelation at the end of an epic lightsaber duel. Hands down the best that 'Star Wars' has to offer, unlikely to ever be matched or topped no matter how long the cinematic universe keeps rattling on.96/100",10,0,0,9 December 2019

","Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, Henry Thomas, John C. Reilly, Liam Neeson, Gary Lewis, Lawrence Gilliard Jr. (R)Grand, sprawling Scorsese epic set in the New York City slums during the mid-19th century blending (embellished) history and the fictional story of DiCaprio seeking revenge against Day-Lewis for the death of his gang leader father. A feast for the senses, especially Dante Ferretti's sensational set design and a soundtrack mixing eclectic folk compositions with Howard Shore's stirring score (to say nothing for an Oscar-nominated tune from U2), it's like plunging into a grimy furnace for the better part of three punishing hours and emerging crusty, smeared, victorious. Like his other gangster sagas, Scorsese fills the story and screen with juicy details on the fringes that elevates the material above mere revenge story set in city filth; it's ultimately about the bloody birth of 'America' as fought on the streets of its largest, messiest metropolis. Loses some narrative momentum in the last hour but rarely falls short of engrossing, oft-mesmerizing. Day-Lewis tears into the role of the rapacious but undeniably charismatic Bill the Butcher with so much relish that it's nearly impossible to take eyes off him; so potent, he often reduces his primary co-stars (DiCaprio & Diaz, both doing solid period work) to mere fresh meat wanting for tenderizing. Not quite on the same tier as Scorsese's most searing, towering masterpieces, but very close, and this one is arguably the most purely ambitious film of his career.91/100",9,6,7,15 July 2019

Cohen, Harry Waters Jr. (PG)Irresistible time travel adventure comedy finds teenager Marty McFly (Fox) witnessing wacky scientist pal Doc Brown (Lloyd) successfully test out his time-machine-on-wheels, and then gets stuck in the past after inadvertently going back in time thirty years. Energy, humor and action to spare, not to mention plenty of nifty hardware and blazing special effects, but this is far more than a sleek wind-up toy of thrills; it also poses a fascinating rhetorical concept well worth exploring: what if you could meet your parents when they were in high school? The script by Zemeckis and Bob Gale is an amazing construction (despite the oft-parroted paradoxical plot holes), full of clever dialogue, twists and payoffs--that the project was rejected by Hollywood dozens of times before finally getting greenlit proves just how shortsighted the major studios often are. Filled with wonderful, near-iconic performances and Alan Silvestri's rousing music (not to mention Huey Lewis' catchy contributions--he also cameos as a teacher); lots of laughs, lots of heart, lots of exhilaration, as good a family film as there ever has been.

Starring James McAvoy, Keira Knightley, Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, Benedict Cumberbatch, Patrick Kennedy, Brenda Blethyn, Vanessa Redgrave, Juno Temple, Harriet Walter, Gina McKee, Daniel Mays, J√©r√©mie Renier. (R)Respectable adaptation of Ian McEwan's same-named novel (by Christopher Hampton) set in England during the interwar period, depicting the consequences of a lie told by 13-year-old Briony (Ronan) that brings ruin to her sister (Knightley) and the young housekeeper she loves, Robbie (McAvoy). Although the foundation of the plot device that creates the evidentiary misunderstanding is straight out of a clumsy farce, the scenes set at the Tallis country estate are far and away the most involving (due in large part to Ronan's poised presence, as well as the promise of tension and scandal). Once the story moves ahead a few years to the Second World War, the storytelling becomes disjointed and Wright's decorous instincts are vanquished by preening showmanship, exemplified by the Dunkirk beach scene, a complicated and technically impressive long shot that exists as a grandiose monument to itself without the rationality or resonance it needs to really work. At one point, Robbie instructs Briony to provide 'just the truth...no embellishments'; pity the filmmakers didn't follow suit. Despite falling far short of greatness, the movie is too ably performed, richly photogenic, and aurally scintillating to dismiss--the implementation of clacking typewriter keys in Dario Marianelli's Oscar-winning score is one of the few bold experiments that succeeds.63/100",6,2,3,12 April 2020

(PG-13)In a contaminated future world where survivors live in a sterile, isolated compound, citizens are randomly selected by lottery to go to 'the Island,' the last safe place on Earth, but curious inhabitant McGregor begins to ask questions and...well, isn't it obvious? Has potential from the outset--despite the derivative nature of the premise and setting (cobbled together from 'Logan's Run,' 'THX 1138,' 'The Matrix,' and others, to say nothing for outright stealing from 'Parts: The Clonus Horror'), there are at least well-designed visuals and eerie touches, like the tiny, arachnid-like sensors that scurry behind McGregor's eyeball. But then it degenerates into the sort of frenetic yet mechanically destructive action picture that made director Bay rich and famous; just a series of chases and fights and explosions where craft is defined by repetitive chaos and noise. And this time, the camera doesn't just leer over slo-mo demolition and the female form--it also arguably takes product placement to new levels of distraction. But anything to distract the audience from constantly asking how the indestructible protagonists are such quick studies in the real world, right?34/100",3,0,4,25 February 2020

(PG-13)The gearhead gang is back once again (excuse me, 'family'), this time taking turns pursuing and being pursued by the brother (Statham) of the last baddie they took down. The street racing component is limited to a single brief scene at the beginning; the rest of the time, they're just IMF with hotter cars and smaller vocabularies (an undercover heist at a party in Abu Dhabi feels at times like a plagiarism of the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise). If the last few outings were really dumb, this one is just plain stupid--raucous fun in fits and bursts, but too long, too over-the-top, too overstuffed, with flashy but pointless camera movements masking a firm sense of space, geography and logic. Less mayhem would have been a good thing, none of Gibson would have been a great thing. A few familiar faces make brief appearances, but the real stars will always be the cars and stunts; it's just a shame that so many of those stunts are too obviously staged/digitized and too physically impossible to legitimately thrill. Johnson is sidelined for most of the movie, but his bicep flex during the climax is one for the ages. Walker's final film, and the fitting farewell that caps the film is handled with surprising sensitivity.47/100",5,3,4,7 December 2019
