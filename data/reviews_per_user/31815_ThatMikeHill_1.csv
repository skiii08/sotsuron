First Man," Just saying...
","This will be short,
First Man was possibly the most sit on the edge of my seat intrigue that I've ever experienced. But wait, its based on actual events in history and we know what's going to happen.
I KNOW!!! That's why I couldn't believe how it had me on the edge of my seat.
Loved it!!",10,0,4,28 January 2019
