50 First Dates," Pathetically Unoriginal
","I did not see '50 First Dates,' when it first came out, but a year after that. I was staying in a hotel, and with nothing to do, I decided to watch it. I want those 99 minutes from my life back!! I absolutely hated this movie! Je d√©teste beaucoup '50 First Dates'! Why? As the title hinted, it was too unoriginal. I'd like to say that Hollywood is doling out wonderful movies that deserve the many Oscars they are presented with, but they don't. '50 First Dates' is a perfect example. The movie has a poor plot that basically moves around this guy trying to win back this girl (who's really rude I might add) every single day because she has short term memory disorder. The video he puts together is sweet, but watching that thing everyday, every few minutes, made me want to gouge out my eyes, or kick the director in the stomach. To fill in the gaping gaps that this movie is filled with are sex jokes. Wow, how original!! Everybody knows that sex jokes make a great movie!! Sex jokes are embarrassing, rude and immature. If you joke about sexual organs, you probably shouldn't hit the sheets for another 20 years! That's how much I hate those people. What's more disappointing is the audience that goes to see these movies are actually stupid enough to laugh and think they're funny without being slightly taken aback or disgusted. It's pathetic. The end of the movie is corny and of course the happy ending you guess. Then again, it was cute, but I just think they should've done something a little different, but have them get back together. All in all, this movie had a lousy plot, lousy actors and horrible void fillers. The only reason it get a 3/10 is because it's in Hawaii. Had they put it in the mainland it would've gotten a 1/10",3,2,5,13 November 2005
Ed Wood," Tim Burton . . . You always surprise me!!
","I loved this movie. I thought is was SO funny!!!!! Johnny Depp did a fantastic job at being Ed Wood, and Martin Landau was no exception. Surprisingly, Sarah Jessica Parker did a fantastic job, and this is one of Bill Murray's better roles. It was a funny and touching movie, and proves that Edward D. Wood Jr. was not some demented transvestite who made horrible movies. It showed the audience the fuel that was motivating Ed's choices, instead of making him into some freak. What I loved was the bond that was created between Bela and Ed. This is where Depp and Landau come in handy. They did such terrific jobs, Depp turning Wood into a sweet, sincere, funny person, and Landau creating a beautiful picture of Bela Lugosi. I cried when Bela died. It was very sad. Ed Wood is a wonderful movie, humorous and touching. I deduct a point for the profound use of language. Geez!",9,0,1,8 November 2005
American Pie," I'm 14 . . . and I hated this movie!!
","I had always heard that 'American Pie' was so hilarious!!! Now let me say that I had heard this from a bunch of teenagers, when I was 12. They were my age. Even when I was 12 I really didn't like kids or teenagers that much because I though they were completely stupid and so foolish, actually laughing at the sex and toilet humor that they think is hilarious. This movie was full of them, and I was perplexed on how anybody could really find this cute. Personally I think it's disgusting and repulsive, not to mention embarrassing and diminishing to one's reputation. How do you think people regard me? They think I actually am that intelligent. Ew. Back to the movie. I have to say besides the jokes, the movie plot was horrible, very fragile and frail, like a building with a poorly constructed frame. It really had no purpose. They wanted to lose their virginity by prom night? Whoop-dee-doo, there is barely a teenager who doesn't. Way to be unique. The acting wasn't the best I've ever seen, but then again I don't really like most of the actors. I don't really like Tara Reid that much. To me she never picked character's that I actually sympathized with. What disappoints me most about this film, and many recent films, is that they seem to take teen sex, or sex outside of marriage, as some little joke, like it doesn't matter. I'm a Catholic, but this really doesn't have to do with anything about my faith. Sex is a deep expression of love and something that should not be taken lightly, especially since the only reason they want to screw you is to for their own pleasure, or their own sick goals, like in this noble movie(ew). With all the pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted diseases, sex is not as carefree (if it ever was) as it used to be, and it doesn't help when Hollywood promotes it as a selling point. Oh my goodness, grow up already!",1,18,46,27 November 2005
Edward Scissorhands," The Best Movie Ever in History
","When I first watched Edward Scissorhands, my favorite movie of all time, I was 13, and the only reason I saw it was because I was an avid Johnny Depp fan, loving his looks and acting abilities. When I saw Edward Scissorhands, I was deeply moved. I saw Edward as a sweet, caring man, a special individual, a type of person I have only seen once. At the end of the movie, I had come to love Edward, and valued him as an unforgettable movie character. At the end, I cried so hard. I was sobbing. It was horrible, yet sad, happy and beautiful all at the same time. Now every time I watch, I swear, I always cry. I'm just a romantic, sensitive 14 year old. There are so many reasons though why this is my favorite movie. The least important one is that is has beautiful scenery. The pastel neighborhood looked like Easter colored candies. The house where Edward lives is hauntingly beautiful, with the black, decaying house, yet the radiant garden of sculptured bushes and beds of flowers spread over the grounds. The scene with the Snow Angel. Oh. My. Goodness. That scene took my breath away. It was angelic, exquisite, magnificent poetry that captured the innocence of Edward, and the beauty and creativity he possesses. The next one is the wonderful job of the cast, crew, music and director. I have to say that Tim Burton is my all time favorite director, this was the piece that moved me the most. It is his greatest work, the way he told the story. The cute beginning with the grandmother and her granddaughter, the way he introduced the audience to Edward, the way he tells the story, throwing in the quirks and jokes without being dirty or crude like so many directors with no talent today. The way he told the ending, the way he made us say, ' Oh, that was so sad!!' The next reason is probably a little foolish, but . . . this was the very first movie to make me cry, I mean sob. Until then, at a sentimental part in a show, play, movie or song, I was neutral, showing no emotion. Now tears trickle down my cheeks when I hear Puff the Magic Dragon. The most important reason is this; this movie made me appreciate the beauty, kindness and sensitivity of the human heart, those qualities that all humans possess, but pretty much never reveal. More critical than that is it showed me the importance of love. The ending, really made me realize that, and not blush about it. Today I am one of the very few youth who realize the power of love, compassion and kindness, the beauty of the heart. Most people say that Edward was 'trying to fit in.' Personally, I think it is something else. I think he was looking for the feeling of being loved, of knowing that someone cared about him, of knowing that if he were alive, someone would care. In reality, is that not what we all want, maybe deep down? We all want to know that someone cares for us, more than anything. That someone would care if we were hurt, lonely, sad, happy, angry or whatever. In the end, I cannot really fully explain why Edward Scissorhands is the epitome of film. I do know it's beautiful, gorgeous, touching, cinematic poetry. Edward Scissorhands is not only great entertainment, but it is a flawless piece of sentimental art that every person should appreciate. Edward was a sweet, caring person with a heart of gold, something so rare that of all the people I know, there's only one person who is really comparable to him. That's sad, really. All I can say as I begin to end this review is that Edward Scissorhands is probably the best cinema that has ever been created, the best story that fully captures the depths of the heart, touches you and makes you sad and happy at the same time. If you haven't seen it, you should. I would give this movie infinity/10, but it wasn't an option. Edward Scissorhands is cinematic gold.",10,11,15,7 November 2005
