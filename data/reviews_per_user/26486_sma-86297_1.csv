Blade Runner 2049," Just Another Middle Of The Road Movie
","This film is just another average modern production. It shares the same faults and advantages as all the other films being release nowadays.It is too long. Directors start believing in themselves and banish their editors to the corner The CGI is great and improves day by day. The palette is impressive here, but the originality of the prequel is gone.Reviewers are overwhelmingly obedient when they have to be and are overly positive. Moreover, the reviews are give away the plot. going on I knew what half the story was.It is a sequel. Dick wrote one book on the topic. Why are there two films now? Hollywood is addicted to its sequels. This drug is bad for the taker, but Hollywood cannot break the habit.Not enough good looking flaunting women. These are PC times we live in, which is sad for the eyes.Movie is slow. Should they bring back intermissions? They could, but in today's busy society it will not work.This sequel was not a necessity, but it is not bad either. It just is too stereotypical for current films.",Null,32,61,11 October 2017
