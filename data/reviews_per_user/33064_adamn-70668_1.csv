Blade Runner 2049," Alright visuals, slow pace
","The impressive visuals do well to keep your attention for a short while, but the movie itself is far too long and slow paced to be considered a 'good' film. It's length of 2hours 45mins could have easily been reduced to half that length while still retaining the core story. The movie is highly forgettable, with very little character development or attachment to the audience - and none of them are likable.",4,5,9,1 December 2017
