United 93," deeply moving and raw viewing
","first off there are not enough words in this world possible to describe 'united 93' i went into the theatre with mixed feelings about this movie because i had a negative felling about this film, that everyone is trying to get rich of what happened on September 11th 2001? but after seeing this movie tonight all the negative feelings and thoughts had just gone and what i was left with was depression, sadness and felling helpless. what i found different was when me and my mate leave the theatre after seeing a movie we have a laugh and joke about and reflect on the movie, but with this movie i left the theatre felling very empty and moved with what had been shown to us, the story is amazing and drags you in straight away and has no intention off letting you go, the acting is mind blowing and raw, at certain points i forgot this was a movie it felt like i was on that plain and felling the fear off death. i would recommend this to everyone because it will make you think twice about human nature and how lucky we are to still be alive, this movie is very emontional and at times difficult to watch but its raw viewing i would beg everyone to go and watch united 93 so that everyone can see what happened on flight united 93 and witness the vulnerability of everyone aboard flight united 93?",10,3,7,11 June 2006
Monster," emotional, powerful and Aileen's story!
","powerful,emotional,mind-blowing,courage,astounding,compelling,tough?when i first saw monster at first i was shocked at the story and the performance because i've never known a story to be so powerful and yet so detailed and to top it all charlize Theron was the character of Aileen and i could not believe my eye's and what i had just saw?Aileen was a woman who grew up in an abusive life and was beaten on a regular bases and would do things that at the age of 9 is coincided shocking but as the years go by Aileen becomes the woman magnet of every school boys fantasy she starts to sell her body and at the age of 13 she becomes a prostitute and begins to live out in the cold damp streets of Michigan and local woods and soon begins to kill her clients after one client attempts rape. to me after nearly being raped that triggers off a certain rage inside Aileen that she is showing us she will not allow another man to neither rape or beat her that she is willing to kill that client if need be in any case a string of murders are not far behind Aileen ? charlize Theron puts on the best performance on in her life and proves to every one that she isn't just a pretty face but a woman with a huge amount of talent and willing to go where no woman has gone before? monster is a tragic tale of love,hope and sadness, charlize has shown us all through her journey that Aileen had to be strong and wasn't allowed to be weak as she had Selby come along soon after Aileen didn't have the luxury of showing her emotions so we should all take into account that Alleen had it rough from birth to grave?",10,1,1,9 February 2006
Brokeback Mountain," ang lee's courage and view on love on brokeback mountain.
","there are not enough words in this world today to describe how brokeback mountain affected me? i just saw the film again and it still gets me to shed a few tears, i don't no what it is about the movie but its so moving and at times deeply sad but i guess its due to Ennis and jack. when i saw this for the second time it made me think that jack and Ennis reminded me of jack and rose (titanic)that there love was real and deep that the first time jack saw rose he felt a connection (first time jack see's Ennis outside waiting for employment) ang lee has done the world proud.am so glad that this film was done and completed, as word had it that this film was still on the shelf 10 years ago but ang lee had both guts and courage and for that iam so proud. Jake and heath did amazing jobs as jack and Ennis but at the same time Michelle and Ann Hathaway did wonderful jobs as the wife's alma and Laureen well done to the cast of brokeback mountain. brokeback mountain is the movie of 2005, brokeback mountain is shocking,moving,deep and beautiful, even if you are scared to go and watch brokeback mountain believe me, when you walk into to cinema you'll have doubts but when you walk out you will be sad and moved and will believe in a thing called love which is shown in front of us through jack and Ennis.always in our in thoughts never leave ......brokeback mountain.",10,18,20,29 January 2006
Silent Hill," the hills are alive?
","i just got back from a screening of 'silent hill' and was blown away by the movie. this is the best video game ever to be made? the story line was top-notch and very gripping, its very deep and scary losing a loved one and not knowing weather that person is alive!the story line sticks to the original silent hill game (ps1)and sticks to every character that was designed in the game. i found this film very dark and creepy but at the same time i couldn't help but be on edge from start to finish, the film in tol was execlent and very well done to say its from a game, the characters where well captured and made me fell a lot of sympathy for rose, Cybill was the best as she stuck out as a tough ass bitch from start to ????? and last but not least the creatures of silent hill, i was very happy to see that the pyramid made his screen debut, i also loved the nurses they where full on creepy and very well designed? silent hill is an amazing horror experience and being a silent hill fan i was 100% satisfied with the movie.go see silent hill you will not be disappointed......trust me",10,3,5,24 April 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," wrong turn+Texas chainsaw = worthy remake
","i saw this movie last night and was surprised because most remakes today ain't all what they cracked up to be, but this was a remake that truly stuck to the original (1977 version)story. the story is the same, a family going on a trip to san Diego to celebrate there parents anniversary they are lead in the wrong direction by the local nut? and from there things don't go the way they where planned.an accident takes place that leaves them stranded in the middle of the desert and they soon come to realise that they ain't alone,not far from them is a bunch of family cannibals who pray on the family for there next meal. its a good remake and i would recommend this to any fan of horror? and if you liked Wes cravens original 1977 version (of the same title) you will certainly love this but i do warn you... it contains strong bloody violence and disturbing images? you have been warned??",10,9,21,11 March 2006
World Trade Center," the story of the falling towers
","i don't really know where to start, what i would like to say is the movie is fantastic and very moving.there will never be enough words in this world to describe what we saw and witnessed on September 11th 2001 but for me the movie helped me move on from this evil we saw what was good about this sensitive topic was the director (oliver stone) made you fill like you where there, inside the towers, with the firefighters and that just made the movie that much more raw for me.another topic we should touch on is that not a lot of special effects where used, yes we needed the towers for the movie and the smoke from the crash and other stuff, but what little effects where used left me gob-smacked, the towers looked so real as they stood high and proud over looking new york city and the smoke from the crash's i personally was so amazed by them things.i would recommend everybody to go and see this as we get a better view from what happened on September 11th and witness the strength and courage of both Two Port Authority police officers and the world. this movie stuck with me long after the credits rolled, please go and see this its truly heartfelt movie-making.",10,1,4,1 October 2006
