The Expendables 2," I fell asleep!!!
","Ridiculous, unending, unbelievable action with the good guys mowing down the bad guys with little or no effort or seriousness. Just a bunch of geriatric egomaniacs flexing for the camera and advertising plastic surgery, dental work and mens hair coloring. I fell asleep 45 minutes into the film and when I woke it was just more of the same and I didn't care a bit about what was happening in the movie so I just got up and left. This movie is a complete waste. They are forcing me to write 10 lines of text in order to post, but seriously there isn't enough content in this movie to write 10 lines about. The only legit actor in this movie with any impactful skill is Willis, but he is barely in the movie. Stalone, Arnold, Norris, Van Damme, and Lundgren should quit acting.",1,19,38,19 August 2012
