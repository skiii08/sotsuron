Howl's Moving Castle," Amazing story
","I have loved all the Hayao Miyazaki's movies I have seen. And this one is no exception. The characters are so compelling, even though the story is so fantastical, you can actually relate to them. The story is also beautiful and you can see the growth in the characters as is progresses. I do really recommend it to everyone who wants to experience something magical and amazing.",10,2,2,3 March 2018
