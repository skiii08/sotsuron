Walk the Line," these guys kick as*
","I may make a run on sentence to make up my ten lines but my point is this == these guys rocked ,, Phoenix and Witherspoon sang every note and they did it well . As a person whom is not an avid country music listener I had no idea that it was not the real deal ... Golden globes are meant to be party favors they deserve the real golden prize . I could not believe it when the credits rolled and it was the first time we actually heard the real Johnny Cash and June Carter . It truly is a shame that Mr and Mrs Cash did not live to see this film . I think they could not help but be proud of the work these young stars put in . If ever some one wants to argue about how easy these guys have it ... just try to be Johny Cash .",8,1,2,31 March 2006
