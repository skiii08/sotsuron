Antz," last possibility movie
","i was very disappointed after watching this movie, the quality of the movie itself is so bad to be such a new movie. Or could it be just my legally purchased copy of this DVD movie thats bad?. I think it is little believable.In my opinion the movie is also very boring. I didn't smile or laugh one single time. most likely just not my type of movie?. well I love the comedy in pixar's cartoons, but this movie didn't have a Chance. I really think watching this movie is one of my life mistakes.If you want to watch this movie, then do it, But you could use that time for something more useful like watching flowers grow.",2,3,8,30 July 2006
