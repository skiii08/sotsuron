","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (14-30 July 1999) script & direction-Daniel Myrick, Eduardo SÃ¡nchez Cast-Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael C. Williams. Everything is unusual in this movie its camera, cast, location, concept & even mostly its marketing.People was told before releasing the movie that the movie is actually the edited footage of 3 film students which was recovered by directors after 1 year after their death in the haunted woods of Burkistville formerly known as Blair. (ofcours a marketing trick but at least not a cheap one like todays movies affairs & all...) the trick worked great and movie hit the charts. The rumors about the movie's story were produced even MOCK interviews of people supporting that story is true & of the parents of so called lost students were produced. The movie was shot like a documentary from actors themselves giving the original & amateur touch to it.The movie's like this-3 film students Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard & Michael Williams set to make a documentary on the old myth of Blair Witch in Burkistville,Maryland area.They start their shoot from the local cemetery & begin to interview the people in village. 2 locals tell them about the man named Justin Parr who kidnapped the 7 children & killed them during 1940-41. Justin took children to his house in woods which were said to be haunted by a spirit of lady killed in 18th century for witchcraft. Later when Justin was captured he told police that the witch in woods possessed him to do so. He used to kill the children cruelly he wold take 2 children in basement & kill 1 of them while other stands there facing the corner then he would kill the other too. Also a woman told 3 of them that she had an encounter with the witch in woods. All interview are shown like real interviews in documentaries, which sets the mood.Next day they start to search the woods for shooting the evidence of Blair witch. They left their car on road & start to walk toward the coffin rock, where 5 men found to be killed ritually some years before. In their way, fishermen warn them about the woods being haunted. They shoot coffin rock & camp there for night. Next day they went deep into the woods. But unaware of their exact location on map. At the eve they find the place like old cemetery, & saw the 7 small heaps of rock(cairns) on the ground. They set up the camp & in night return to shoot the cairns. Accidentally josh disturb cairn by his leg, which heather hastily repair later. In night, heather hear the strange noises in the night. Next they they start to walk to get their car.

Heather is boss so she starts trying to make the other 2 feel like everything is under control & it make the matter worst. They set camp again & now all hear the noises. Next morning, they find 3 cairns around their camp. They again try to find their way out, but map is also lost & near daybreak they discover the stuff like voodoo on allover the trees they get a another shock when they realize that they are standing on same place from where they started in the morning. The arguments in between starts to intensify out of frustration. That night with noises of children, they also feel the movement outside & rattling on their camp walls.
