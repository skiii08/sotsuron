Mission: Impossible III," Worth watching at home.
","This movie is great if you have some free time to spend at home. After watching parts 1 and 2 I thought the 3rd part would be much worse than it actually is. The action is pretty intense, it's definitely not a boring movie. It's a 100% action movie, contains no message at all, just pure entertainment. The acting is pretty good, the cast was well chosen. What to expect from this movie? Explosions, shooting, more explosions, funny hi-tech gear, and so on Just like in the previous parts. But, it ain't a movie that I'd go watch in a theater. It's not the kinda movie you go to see in a theater. I admit, I had fun watching it, but was kinda disappointed. Basically because the movie doesn't show anything new. They use the same gear as in the previous parts, the plot is predictable and not innovative, although there is a surprising twist of action at one point. Overall, its a good movie to watch at home, but I wouldn't waste money on going to a theater.",7,17,32,28 May 2006
