The Equalizer," Good story and just for Densel's performance the movie gets the best ratings
","This whole movie is all about Densel's performance on each frame. Story is definitely great, I wished the villain had more story of the past rather than narrated. Could have helped for the Part 2. Overall fun movie",8,0,0,16 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Don't have a strong story
","The Captain Marvel is made powerful, but she don't have that strong story line portrayed to back it up and it looks cold acting.",6,0,5,27 April 2019
Full Metal Jacket," Brilliantly crafted to show two halves of same story viewed from Joker
","Matthew Modine as Joker, tells a story of how he see his fellow mate is being subjected to 'kill' his trainer, in turn killing himself while Joker keeps watching it happen. And the same state with Vietnam trying to defend itself and he does face the same situation at gun point pushed to kill a woman at the end who is being subjected to the war for no reason. It's tough to see this brilliance at first view but when you get what Stanley Kubrick did with a dark comedy with this movie is quite brilliant. Many just get tangled to the war scenes and feel that it's one of the greatest war movies. But it's more than that.",8,0,0,6 May 2019
Coco," A must watch. A fresh perspective of film
",Coco's cuteness will win your hearts. Though its pretty neat story and it efficiently brings the emotion from unknown quarters,9,0,0,11 June 2019
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Good movie but could have been better.
","Takes lot of inspiration from Zero Dark Thirty. But at times becomes melodramatic. Second half is great but acting seems more trying to push strong emotions than leading the story bring the emotions. It's definitely great movie if they toned down a bit of personal story and cut off few to minimize the story time, but it fits for Indian audience. It could have been made even more awesome not leaning towards Hollywood but making it more realistic. Seems cliche in few shots so needed few bits of editing.",6,1,6,16 January 2019
