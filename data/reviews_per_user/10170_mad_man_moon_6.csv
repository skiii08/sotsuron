Black Swan," Flat
","Wasn't blown away by this.Sure it was beautiful, and that is why it gets a positive review, 6 is (after all) a positive score.However there wasn't an amazing performance by anyone, perhaps Cassell is a repressed enough performance. I just didn't really find it evocative in any way, and perhaps that came from the performances. Maybe it didn't, I'm not sure, I can't deconstruct that much.I'm not being senselessly horrid, I just was not emotionally involved with this. Which is a real shame after being completely disembowelled by RFAD and heart broken by TF.Maybe Wolverine will mess with me more.",6,0,0,13 March 2011
Suicide Squad," Her Heart's Not In It
","Don't watch this film.Right, that said, here's what I attacked my arm with a sharpie with whilst watching this awful, awful, film. I have pictorial evidence of this which I'm happy to DM or something here, I was going to link to a tinypic, but that seemed a little dodgy. Here's what I 'memento'd' my arm with: intro ... actors ... Expoition ... A-Team intro ... pacing ... Enchantress Good ... not convincing ... violence too old / humour too young ... no drama for Joker despite good performance ... incomprehensible dark fight ... comic beats all miss ... ---censored quote from end of film--- ...So, three things up front: Firstly, because of how I wrote my arm comments, the reaction here will be mostly (but not obviously) chronologically based on what happened, but there are no spoilers here. Secondly, I've not exposed myself to hype or reaction to the film, so thoughts and feelings are my own, uninfluenced by media, social media, or friends. Then finally (related to number two) I go in to a film straight, meaning that even if I love the trailer I'll not go in thinking it'll be great. This works the other way, too ... I really found Sisters quite hilarious.OK, I've given my 'intro', so why not look at theirs ... theirs being the first, painful, forty minutes of a film this year, which basically boils down to 'The A-Team'. So, yeah, I'm not sure that I've seen more exposition so obviously spelled out for me on screen in years ... sometimes literally. But there's more expository nonsense that just keeps flooding, and flooding, your ears and eyes. I have a theory that if you remove 90% of the flashbacks you might have a shorter film buy the performances would actually have some subtlety to them. Harley's craziness would be ... CRAZY ... Joker's motivations (as I believe they should be) would be indecipherable ... Laton's few genuine emotions would be sold so hard. I do feel like this over usage of flashback (without overtly fetishising it for irony-lolz) is just more heavy literal thinking and expository pointlessness. The actors on show here can *perform* and most of that is lost if you spell out all of that to the viewer.That's probably the only issue with the performances, I think. They all seem to be doing a relatively good job with what was written the horrible pacing and structure just bury emotion, humour, and subtlety which basically kills any effective character development. Although I'll focus minutely on Robbie's performance which I just couldn't get anything from, I do put that down to editorial interference though, it just feels like your fringe friend that is pretending a little too hard. She does, though, like every other player, get given one decent emotional moment to sell (you'll know them when they come because of the massive sign on the screen saying 'BIG EMOTIONAL MOMENT'), and these are all handled well enough, but are completely buried by the overwrought stylings of the film.I guess that can nicely lead in to my one large positive from this complete mess of a film; Cara Delavigne's performance and most of the handling of The Enchantress in general. This said, I didn't feel that she was super threatening, but that's neither here nor there in this part of the analysis. The character really did fit the GRIMDARK aesthetic of the DC films thus far, and I think she'd have worked very well in any of the other properties that they have, so I'd like to see her kept around for when they get to magic in their Universe. I think the lack of threat probably came from it looking much like a weaker version of the planet smasher from MOS. Anyway, I digress, Delavigne is using those peepers perfectly, and really holds the screen and your thoughts well. It feels very much like the only decent, real, emotional, character building that happens, and when it does it's so sparse that I think that it's good that we got what we did out of it.Let's salute the GRIMDARK again, and take a quick snigger at the poor attempts to bring humour in to the fray. There is only one really good line that actually lands throughout the whole thing and it's Killer Croc that gets it. Otherwise the unfortunate literal nature of the film meant that I actually laughed more at one of Rick Flagg's last lines as an extremely helpful indicator of what was actually occurring for the characters... Tommy Wiseau level stuff. It's a sad time when you're laughing *at* a film rather than with it, it's sad because they could have cut some of the violence and aimed this solely at kids (it's a 15 in the UK) and lose some level of the 'bad guy' device, or ramp that up, and lose the Nickleodeon level 'humour.' So amongst the usual things that have plagued the Snyder films (he's EP on this, Ayer wrote and directed everything apart from a Boomerang Flashback) like the grimdark, the bad storytelling, the grimdark, the lack of humour, the gri... ... this just doesn't work on nearly every level. Poorly scripted, presented, directed, and ultimately this all ruining performances, it just all points to an unfortunate vision from Ayer.I'm actually lowering my score having read back what I'd written here, which puts it level with 'The Room' ... maybe I'll have a think about that.",2,3,7,8 August 2016
Doctor Strange," The Lights Are Definitely On ...
","... but unfortunately no-one's home. By which I mean to say: Plenty of things are happening, but there is no evocative core, character building, or genuine emotion. It's a film for people that need things to happen, without any feels involved. It's full of bombast, exposition, left field cuts and platitudinous axioms that essentially do not amount to much. This leaves very little space for performance or subtlety from the leads. That being said there is good space (made) for comedy, and it's very well done. Ultimately, though, it's a shame that those short moments (which gave more character than any other in the film) are few and far between. Even the physical comedy is good. It's by no means a dark and broody affair, it's just that the pace is far too fast, and the cuts are far too frequent for any personal narrative to build over all the stuff that is happening. This is a shame, because the film is gorgeous, and I was genuinely blown away a few times. Visually it's stunning, however that really translates poorly to any drama for the characters involved. I believe that there is a film in there, somewhere, perhaps on the cutting room floor, I do not know. Perhaps I needed a bit more time with him as a person before and after before we were thrown in to scene after scene of (quite, quite, awesome) action. Ultimately, I think they've struggled to tame the language, and have perhaps gone a bit too respectful of the source material, which is unweildy at the best of times. Dumbing it down really could have helped the performances sell this a little more, and since we are at the start of the good Doctor's journey, that might not have been too bad a thing. It's fine, but there is more film in there somewhere, begging to get out of the mirror that this is.",5,17,47,25 October 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," sad
","sad is not meant as an insult.emotionally, this should hopefully rip in to you almost completely throughout.the film doesn't bite its tongue, and performs at the perfect pace. the cast (digital and non) are perfect.if you want to be literal, or detail oriented with your viewing; with the small touches it is very much in theme with everything around it (its legacy/future).it's it plays perfectly, too. it's like the first chapter of something immense ...wonderful.",9,2,5,15 November 2011
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A Music Video That Isn't Even Cool
","OK, I'm going to say at the outset, this is just so badly written and directed. It's a confusing mess of a billion things happening, none of them interesting, with zero desire to care for any characters, events, or happenings.So, yeah it's tremendously bad, possibly worse than MoS.Nothing matters, stuff is just happening ... constantly. There's zero character development which therefore means that there's no reason to care about anyone or anything. You can pretty much sleep through most of it, as it does get old fast, people speaking in snapshots, no real conversation or life (barring one bath scene), and it really doesn't have a middle at all. In fact there's very little start to this film, either, just a whole heap of end ... End ......EEEEENNNNNNDDDDDD.There was an ongoing thing a long while back whereby a lot of film viewers were saying that 'what we really need is a film where superman gets to hit things a lot. Yes, that will definitely make a good supes film' ........ Oh ... kay ... now you've had two of those, with zero hope, light, and love for the man, nothing. He's a flying fist (with the characterisation that goes with that) and somehow that fist scowls more than Bruce Wayne at someone's parent's Silver Anniversary.This has all the scripting of YouTube 'versus fight' with figurines (except those have more than one -bad- joke).The animated DCs aren't the most amazing cartoons these days (come on, guys, get it back on track with a bit of world building there) but at least they develop character, build story, and push you to care. Perhaps look over there for some talent, rather than the comic side of thing (which aren't going great).I'll tell you now, I actually fell asleep during bits of this music video.This is not a good film, and it's a shame, because there's so much to work with. I really hope that the awfulness of this film will actually propel the Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, and Flash, films to greater acceptance. But only if the latter two (the first is about bad guys) actually have some real light in them. Spoiler alert there's only two seconds of sunlight in this one.",3,4,8,29 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What a Waste
","Well that was glib and not good.With very little emotional involvement, this was nothing like the Lucas films that predate it. Except for the one thing, Daisy Ridley is a true successor to Mark Hamill, because ... hey ... neither of the actors can act or at least they don't in these films.Also the lack of engagement with this meant that I didn't get any real sense of scale because if there's no importance, then why will I care how big some gun is? Anyway, everything is either enormous or not there at all. There was no lingering anywhere, no time to drink it in. Ridley's character seems like she's supposed to be suffering, and barely living, but her (non) arc provides nothing of this until someone *actually says it out loud*. Even the flashbacks don't assist that, and her performance suggests nothing throughout.Talk of story brings us to this weird overly 'expositional' (I like to make up words, sue me) style, and despite the film having a literal description of what has happened so far they spend the half the thing explaining everything ... which is so redundant it hurts. These are supposed to be films for kids, and kids get visual story telling, they've got this. There were six of the things so far, and they've only looked away for the twenty minutes of Vader and Darth mommy making the most horrible couple ever. There is room to tell a visual story here ... there are two more films!!!!Due to the mountains of explanations, that mire this script beyond all recognition, little happens beyond run, fight, bomb ... FLASHBACK!Too much exposition, no meaning.What's that, JJ? These miserable 'emo' rejects are supposed to be a force in the galaxy?!? And OK, if you're going to spend some time explaining everything, why not put some effort into the threat? HUH? I mean ... these guys *really* don't come across as imposing at all! Also the generals and admirals seem like some casting agent really screwed Disney on this one.All of this reminds me, if you wanted Luke to have *any* meaning then just build him properly and stretch the story to the next film.So the ironic combination of everyone dragging us through this and the fact that there's less plot than Spectre is not a joy to behold. Watching this as a child the only part of me that was sated was my need for SOMETHING TO BE HAPPENING ALL THE TIME PLEASE ... MUMMY, MY E NUMBERS ARE LOW!The shining light in the whole thing is John Boyega. He's fantastic, giving a performance that hopefully kids will really love, given enough (or making enough) to provide actual emotion to the character and make you really care what happens to him. Fisher and Isaac do well in the short amount amount of screen time that they have. Isaac is *very* assured, but only gets one real character scene, having to Wedge the rest of it ... but as I said, solid. Fisher brings feels in the split seconds she's on screen ... which really makes me happy she was involved. Oh, and one final thing ... main refrain aside, the score is limp, at best. Rey's theme is so toss it hurts, and the rest just blows by with the other crap.Perhaps JJA has done one very good thing with this film. He screwed himself so that all the other directors can work unencumbered by having to do the same.",5,28,47,18 December 2015
