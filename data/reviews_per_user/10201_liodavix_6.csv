It," But what is this?
","Disappointing and mediocre remake.It is not a good adaptation of the book, which ignores almost everything.It's not a good horror movie, because it does not cause fear or suspense or intrigue, just boredom. It only highlights its technical invoice but that's the least I could offer, I believe, considering your budget.The scene of Giorgi in the good version was terrifying and traumatizing, here you just think, you eat it already or not?It simply fails to create fear or even interest, and if that fails, everything else fails.In addition, the footage is excessive, so long for the end do not tell or clarify anything? For a final confrontation so lazy and cold that you get to wish that the clown loads them all for bores and unbearable.Better read the book.Thank you",1,0,5,4 March 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Satiety
","Boring.Routine spin off to continue taking money from the saga at the expense of the patience and good faith of the spectators.Rogue One can only be described as a soulless and spiritless film that is limited to repeating the same formula applied to all Sar wars films, the same schemes the same development, I operate with a single paste, the characters are heroes than ever.The protagonist is the but of all the Star Wars movies, she has no charisma. nor anything that makes her interesting is a cold, stereotyped, typical character.And the rest of the cast? Without comment, a blind Kung Fu teacher in this saga? It doesn't even stick with a tail. What's up, that the screenwriter is a fan of the old films of Jackie Chan and Jet Li?The only change is that this movie is conceived more like a war story, focusing on the battle between the Imperials and the Republicans, but it is not even there that it has emotion, the Imperials shoot three hundred shots and do not hit a rebel, the rebels hit four shots and they take them all down, that's all the thrill of battle the movie sells. Depressing.To all this this is very long and it becomes infinite, because they have to be so long ?, If there is not even an argument or what is happening or what happens, you do not know anything you only see ships, shooting jokes without No grace and pointless follies. Can't the same be done in an hour and a half? Surely the movie would have won a lot with that duration.And Diego Luna, what are you doing here?",3,3,8,20 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The weakest of the three
","I think that the main problem of this second part is due to his rhythm problems and his main partner.There is no doubt that the Annakin-Padme moments are cloying, boring and lacking interest to the viewer. Natalie Portman is very pretty but she is a really bland actress, and Hayden Cristiansen's good guy lags behind, that's why it doesn't work, two sosains without spark or chemistry whose moments of 'hammering' don't interest, bore.Obi Wan is the one who saves the function along with charismatic villains like Count Dokuu, his adventures on the planet Geonosis, with that army of insectoids, as well as that battle of 'graders' in that Lucasian adpatation of a Roman colosseum, is entertaining, spectacular At times, the battle between Yoda and Dooku, mythical, many wanted to see the 'master' of masters handling the lightsaber, and although brief the combat does not disappoint.For the rest, maximum profusion of effects by computer, something that seriously damaged this saga, more busy in the visual, than not telling us a HISTORY, which was something that if he did in the previous trilogy, that if he could get you to care about his characters , not like here, reduced everything to a hodgepodge of visual effects that end up bored and boredThat is my impression of the attack of the clones, the slowest and most cloying of the three, with spectacular and great moments. I do not deny it, but other inflatable and boring, an Annakin, with which they were wrong with the chosen actor, a bland without charisma or energy and a Lucas who showed that as an inventor of worlds he is a genius, but as a director himself , leaves enough to be desired.",5,0,3,28 September 2019
Alien vs. Predator," Six Aliens versus Three Predators
","A movie that could have been much more than it was.The truth is that Paul Anderson did nothing wrong and achieved a pretty attractive film at the visual level.The strong point of the film is that it is very light, it does not insist on telling us a heavy and convoluted story, but it gives us a small but interesting introduction about the arrival of predators to the earth, to get us fully into the great clash between the two creatures, in a brutal extermination fight.The special effects are quite decent, although sometimes you notice too much computer effects in the movements of the aliens, but they are minor defects. The best without a doubt, are the sequences of the queen of the aliens, spectacular and full of tension.
The actors are correct, the protagonist, Sanaa Lathan, is a beautiful woman and brings seriousness and character. From Lance Henriksen I can say, he is a crack and one of my favorite actors, whether his role is good or not, his presence is always appreciated.The only problem of the film is that it lacks more ambition, since the only epicenter of the whole feature film is to see the desired confrontation between both species but this only occurs between three predators, of which two die quickly, and I think, too easily, and a few aliens, it is clear that it should have been something much more epic, with hordes and more hordes of aliens and predators destroying each other mercilessly. Here the truth is that everything is somewhat bland.Anderson's address is correct and his work is not bad but I think that was not enough. Anderson is a less versatile director in commercial films but does not possess the genius and imagination of James Cameron or the psychological depth and sense of suspense of Ridley Scott.In short, Alien vs. Predator is a well-made film at the visual level, with an effective but not masterful direction of Anderson, a story that should have been polished somewhat more but that works equally and a cast that although does not shine is the least solvent.A film with some interesting ideas and sequences, but that remained rather in something failed despite being undoubtedly entertaining.",7,2,2,18 September 2019
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Confessions of a vampire
","A wonderful movie and one of the best vampire films in history.The cast is one of the sexiest, attractive and talented, ever seen on the big screen.Brad Pitt, younger and beautiful than ever plays Louis De Pointe, a young man from Spanish Louisiana, Brad gives his character innocence and humanity, a spirit that does not stop struggling between good and evil, and whose nexus between both parts will be a sweet girl who will take almost for a daughter.Tom Cruise, immeasurable, great, terrifyingly beautiful and magnetic, his character Lestat, produces several sensations, attraction, repulsion, terror, pity especially at the end ... Tom Cruise clearly showed that it was not a pretty face anymore within the Hollywood establishment , making his character speak only with his blue and hypnotic gaze.Kirsten Dunst, being still small when she made the film, her character was not easy, but she showed an admirable maturity, managing to create a character as innocent as in turn dark and perverse, because while she loves Louis, she does not hesitate to kill Lestat, although he was willing to reconcile with her. Showing with it a tender attitude with Louis but also selfish, possessive and capricious.Antonio Banderas, the old vampire Armand, a character of the darkest and gothic, the performance of the Spanish can only be described as sublime, every gesture, every word, conveys a sense of respect and at the same time fear, loves and wishes Louis, although that it can mean its own destruction. A short, but memorable character.Christian Slater, like the journalist Daniel Molloy however is not very used, although certainly his character did not give much more, since it is about telling a past story, so that his character does not have too many options to develop. Anyway, it is not bad, this actor at that time was still popular, before falling into the abyss of self-destruction.And the rest? Neil Jordan once again created a dreamy atmosphere, dark, Gothic and Baroque at the same time, streets lost in dense fogs, the whole movie is like a sweet nightmare from which he wakes up suddenly at the end. This director already showed his ability to create dark and gothic atmospheres, always wrapped in a halo of magic and mystery, as in his famous film In the company of wolves.A story of love, of revenge, betrayal and blood, but above all of passion, of souls tortured and condemned in search of their own redemption and salvation. All with an atmosphere that amazes all the senses.I'm sorry, but I can not stop praising this cinematic delicacy, it's one of my favorites of all times and it will continue to be so. Go, yes.An unrepeatable marvel that you can not miss for anything in the world.",10,2,3,7 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Fall of the galactic empire
","Well, many people tend to praise this sixth installment of the archifamous franchise, although analyzing it coldly, it is the weakest of the first three.I have always liked Star Wars movies, I have never been a freaky, but as a kid, as almost everyone liked to have the dolls of the movies, posters and all that paraphernalia so well mounted by Lucas, a very intelligent uncle without a doubt in When it comes to making money.In this third installment that concerns us, we have a spectacular start, very well done and exciting. The arrival of both the androids, as Luke himself to Jabba the Hutt's lair, to rescue a captured Leia in her attempt to rescue her beloved Han Solo herself, and who has been turned into a sexy slave with one of the most erotic outfits that have been seen in the history of cinema.All that first initial part, until the destruction of Jabba's ship in the well of the almighty Sarlacc, is masterful, hilarious and unforgettable.So, what prevents me from giving this delivery a higher grade? Very simple, the second half of the film with the arrival of the protagonists in Endor, hits a tremendous downturn that perhaps many do not know or do not want to perceive. Simply the whole teddy bear roll is completely left over because it is too childish and even boring. Until that time Star Wars had been a saga for an adolescent-adult audience, but the inclusion of these ewoks already downgraded it to a movie for kids, which did not have to be, but of course, greater public higher income, Lucas is Very very smart, I've always said it.The development, well, we are told about the final echos that lead to the destruction of the second death star, by Darth Vader, ultimately redeeming himself, the death of Palpatine and the end of the Imperial dictatorship, making the republic and the Restoration of the Jedi as guardians of peace in the galaxy. All this in a spectacular and very emotional climax, with melodies by John Williams during the Luke-Vader clash that freeze the blood, phenomenal and very dark.I, like many others, prefer the original 1983 version, in which Sebastian Shaw appeared at the end as Anakin Skywalker, and not Hayden Cristiansen's mammon, which does not stick with a deadly tail in that scene, since on top The effect is fatal and very forced. I also don't like modern fx additives in some sequences simply because they don't connect well with the visual aspect of the set. But this is just my opinion.It is a great sequel and conclusion of the first trilogy, but due to erroneous decisions that I have commented, some teddy bears making antics and certain highs and lows of rhythm and a not very bright direction of Richard Marquand, tied hand and foot as said by Lucas , which controlled even the smallest aspect of its 'toy', as Spielberg once defined it, makes it not so satisfactory and round, since it does not have the opera tone of the first two wonderful parts.",6,0,4,28 September 2019
