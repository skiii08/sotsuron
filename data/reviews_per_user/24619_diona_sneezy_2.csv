Blade Runner 2049," Expectations not met
","I heard about this movie that is great, one of the best SF pictures, one of the viewers said it is not so good however got chritised by another that it is not a movie were rambo shots like crazy and kills the bad guys, that it is at a much higher level....Well..... It is another lever but still I got pretty bored during almost 3 hours while at Rambo there is a bigger quantity of suspense and action at least.When I saw Harrison Ford was in the movie even greater reason to watch because indiana Jones was running in my head and the expectations were even higher, but the down side is that Indiana Jones only appears after 2 hours of boredness and only does something for like 20 minutes, 10 of those 20 he is just punching in the face Ryan Gossling, so big disappointment here. The Blade Runner, aka Ryan G has a straight face all the movie and looks like he is about to cry at every minute. No fun, not even a little joke nothing, all is gloomy and dark. The idea is good, modern slavery, people created in the laboratory to be send on spatial colonies but being much stronger they are used as man power to do chores that normal human beings do not want to do anymore. However this created humans that have all the memories implanted in their head, that never they have been children they are like taken out from the matrix, they rebel, because they have feelings they begin to be more human than the humans who come from the birth canal. And it all climax when a woman created in the lab has a baby, thing that should not have been possible, she has a baby with a human. The mother dies at birth , helped by another created human in the lab to give birth. And the baby is consider a miracle because it is the ultimate proof that even though they are created as full grown up people in the laboratory they are still humans they feel like a human they have emotions they think they dream they care, and they are their own masters, like one of the characters says at the end of the movie. We have new versions of humans - Nexus 8 - who are seeking and 'retiring' older versions who have started to rebel, think and care to much, like really the main reason for which today people still get 'discharged' , when trying to do good in a society that must be corrupted in order for the right people to thrive in it.So slavery is and has been a crime but as as time passes by, humanity will think of a way to use different means to become more lazy and use others to do their work, i mean it is still happening today and not with lab people but with actually humans, their own kind. The future is like a London day, there is no sun at all throughout the whole movie and sometimes is raining just to make things even more depressing.The ending I mean suits the main character as he never smiled laughed or joked during the movie and barely has 100 lines, speaks also very little.Is rather boring and maybe too philosophical for my sleepy brain but still Harrison Ford has done a greater job in indiana jones.And to make a joke as this movie has none what so ever, is like NEXus 8 or Android 7 destroys Good old Nokia who has been so good to us and helped us on our time of need and now we do not even want to look at the anymore....We are such ingrates. hahahaha. I mean at least i have that joke if I could not get more after 3 hours of dozing off.",6,1,4,7 January 2018
Terminator Salvation," Good enough to see at home one a Sunday night
","So I made my decision, John Connor is a major dushbag. All good and mighty and very smart and sensitive robots must die to defend this sucker :)) There is a moment in the movie where John Connor goes to fight alone with Skynet and when his wife asks :'What I am supposed to say to your men when they ask about you' he replies 'I'll be back' , well at that moment if Arnold was watching I think he laughed his pants off , i mean it was so clumsy and stupid coming from John Connor mouth, that i barely could watch.First of all if Sam Worthington and Christian Bale hadn't played in this movie I think IMDb would have deleted the movie from the movie list :)))). Sam Worthington gets the role very nice and he is a delight to watch, hot hot, but Christian Bale is like the comic version of all Terminators until now, I think for a parody he would have been a good choice but for this part it was a rather weak choice. I tell you when he says 'I'll be back ' you cant stop laughing. Its like awkward, so out of place that it takes all the serious action that was happening until then out of your mind and makes it comedy like.Watching this I can tell that The one from 84 and 91 there are Oscar material, the rest are just shallow copies. But thank God that at least this movie had Sam W and Christian Bale they saved the movie just for being present cos the roles and the action are just so weak. I think Sam W is thinking watching this movie 'what the heck was I thinking?'.Another tip, hold one for the first hour cos i was close to stop and go to sleep but I kept hoping that Sam W aka MArcus will kiss the girl. That basically kept me going. :) And again, John Connor, oh my god, do robots with their high IQ really die to defend him??? he's like totally useless, you do more stuff and get things happen when the robots intervene. So I give the movie a 3, but because Bale and Sam are there I give it a 4. :)",4,0,3,8 October 2017
