Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I KNEW I'd like this movie.
","I saw this movie a week ago and I LOVED IT! Jar Jar Binks was really funny! I knew I would like this movie. From all the reviews that say bad things about it , I thought... At least I am a kid and adults think different. I definitely reccomend it for EVERYONE! I would have rated it G. At the movie theatre it said it was PG-13, Yeah right! Jeez. Liam Neesom, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Loid, ETC. WERE GREAT!",Null,0,0,12 June 1999
