Ghost," Most Heart-Touching, Immortal tale of an immortal Love
","Call me biased, call me blind, but this is the most beautiful, heart-touching movie you can see if you are the romantic kind of person. It's like the Bible, the father of all romantic movies. It MAY not be the best out there, but it is definitely a MUST see. It's like those classics that define pure love, a love beyond anything one can imagine, striving story of one soul's wanting to be near his loved one. There may be other movies even better, but this one will surely be remembered as long as there will be 'Love' in people's minds. I watched it like 19 times since it was released and till now, it touches me like it touched me the first time i watched it - true love never grows old - maybe that's why. Enough said, it's time you watch it - only then you will know what i am talking about :)",10,7,9,7 November 2008
Cast Away," An Unbelievable Tale of Life and Survival
","If you haven't seen this movie, you have no idea how a 'one man' movie in a single island can move your mind and emotions like the way it will. Tom Hanks, by far, the greatest actor as i can say, and it's his mezmerizing performance that has made this movie an epic tale. The out-takes, background composition, the greater Philosophy about life and tale of human being, fighting against nature, with only will power to live and survive -- it's unbelievable .. If 10 is the highest rating, this movie deserves 15 .. sorry that i can't rate it more than 10 .. but .. neways, i won't say anything else .. just see it and you will be blown away with the wind...",10,2,3,10 December 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," An amazing tale of hope and patience
","When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie",10,6,8,10 December 2007
