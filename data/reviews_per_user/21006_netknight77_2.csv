The Hangover," Incredibly overrated
","I expect one thing out of a raunchy comedy, and that is to make me laugh. This didn't. I may have chuckled a couple of times. If you're going to be offensive (note: offensive and raunchy are not synonymous), at least make it funny. The premise (and resolution) of the story was fun, but it's just not that great. It's baffling how this series is so popular.",3,0,4,3 June 2019
Bridesmaids," Overrated
","Kind of like the 'female' equivalent of The Hangover. And just as overrated. Lots of toilet humour and nothing interesting about it. Can't believe Melissa McCarthy was nominated for an Oscar for this. For what exactly? Pretending to relieve herself into a sink? (disclaimer: I've liked her since Gilmore Girls, and I begrudge her nothing, but come on). I like a good comedy, and I don't mind it being raunchy. But they forgot to make this funny.",3,2,7,3 June 2019
