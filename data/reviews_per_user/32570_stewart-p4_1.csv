Love and Death," Hmmm.
","I suppose Woody Allen must be the Marmite of the film world. You either love him or hate him.For me, in Love and Death, he comes over as trying to be Charlie Chaplin, the Marx brothers and Woody Allen the neurotic stand-up all in one. It doesn't work.Yes the movie has its funny lines, but I found them too few and far between.'Yes, but he's so clever with his intellectual & cinematic references' Maybe, but that doesn't make the film any funnier.At least I finally managed to watch a Woody Allen film right through. But if I want to laugh at Marx Brothers humour, I'll watch the Marx Brothers. Now they're funny!",4,8,19,15 December 2007
