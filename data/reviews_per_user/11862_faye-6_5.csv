The Blair Witch Project," Very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. *** out of ****
","'The Blair Witch Project' was very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. This is very real material, there is nothing fake about this adventure. The ending left you wondering what actually happened, and what happened to the people. You'll think twice before going into the woods again.--------- 8/10",8,0,0,9 August 1999
The 13th Warrior," Weird. * out of ****
","'The 13th Warrior' was not my kind of movie--I never cared about any of the characters and throughout  most of the film I found myself daydreaming. Antonio Banderas  is a pretty good actor, but I did not like him in this. Not much story here, either.",5,0,1,4 September 1999
American Beauty," One of the better films of 1999. ***1/2 out of ****
","Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening both bring forth near perfectly performances in this production. Spacey (from 1998's best film, 'The Negotiator') certainly can qualify for best actor of the year as the father of a dysfunctional family. Bening, (from this years weird 'In Dreams') is also great as his wife. The plot is hilarious at times. And some of the one-liners that Spacey states are laugh out loud funny. It would be hard to call this film a comedy, though. As a madder of fact, I am not sure what you would categorize this film as?---------------8",8,0,0,1 October 1999
Being John Malkovich," Strange, but in somewhat of a good way. ** out of ****
","'Being John Malkovich' is the most creative movie I have seen in quite some time. It is well made, and I liked the actors involved (John Cusack, Cameron Diaz). However, the strangeness of the movie keeps me from enjoying the overall production. A close call, some of it is very funny. But in the end, I can recommend it. ------------------------6",6,0,0,12 November 1999
The Hurricane," The Best Film of 1999. **** out of ****
","I have always been a fan of Denzel Washington, and that is because of his performances like the portal as Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter in 'The Hurricane.' It is a strong, touching true story that is bold and powerful. The movie is my personal favorite of the year (with the closest competition being 'Blue Streak'). -----------------10/10",10,0,2,5 February 2000
