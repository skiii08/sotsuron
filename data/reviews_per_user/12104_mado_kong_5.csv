The Sound of Music," A really good movie!
","It is a really good movie! What life shall be? This is what life shall be! Because of the education tradition, we, Chinese, are too serious of educaiton. Life shall be full of happiness! I feel shame I have been angry to my daughter's none-concentration on education! She is only a baby! I was not willing to watch the movie because I felt it is too long. It is a pity, I shall have seen it times ago! I will recommend this movie to others if possible! It is not the music only in the movie, it the attitude toward life that really matters! That is the most important part the moves me! All in all, I like it, and I think it is a good movie!",10,3,10,19 April 2008
Forrest Gump," A excellent movie!
","This is a excellent movie! It tells us on this world, the truth is generally the simplest thing. And the truth can exist always. I like this movie, and watch it for two times and still want to watch it, and also I want to buy and save it. With Gump Forest, we can have hope even we meet obstacle. It tell us, if you resist on one thing, and concentrate you spirit on it, you will achieve something that may be out of your expectation. And always, the result is to goodness. I really can't understand why some guys vote it with score 1, and the rate exceeds 2%. It is too strange. The world is colorful, and I can't comment on other votes. I can only say for me, it is a EXCELLENT movie.",10,2,6,8 June 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," The power of time.
","The film is good, it gives us the feeling of the power of time.Noodles, he is just a normal boy who has his own life when he is young. He has made mistakes, but after years, when you go back to the same place, all you can see is history. Everything seems to be familiar, but people changed. Actually, if you stay in one place for years, and then you left, the place will always gives you some feeling. Like the place I went for my university, I have left that place for years and hasn't gone back, but it is always a place with memories. And Max, he is a good actor too. I don't like Frankie, he is kind of hysteria, not only in this movie. Although I have to admit this kind of people is always there in your life. And you have to deal with it.I love the movie.",10,2,6,13 July 2013
Man on Fire," A really good film!
","This is a really good film I can say! The lovely girl! The sentiment is so moving! What's we can leave for this world! The story really moved me! I love it and I have watched it for more than one time! Every time when I am free, I want to watch it! The revenge to the enemy must be tough. And the love the the affectionate shall be deep. Denzel is acting technique is also good. So the same to Dakota. She is a so sunny girl that you can't help liking her. Everyone with a daughter will not understand what pita's father's action. How can he do that! Actually for a good movie, you don't have to say too much to express your feeling. The pity is the site make me have to say more. This is not good!",10,1,5,30 November 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," A great movie!
","What I can say is this is a really great movie. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. You will succeed in the end. And also be ready at any time.Maybe it is because of language problem, I don't grasp it very well in the beginning. But step by step, I understand it. And in the end, I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesn't happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past. And also the performance skill is another thing I like it. They are good actors. And this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic, but still give people good feelings.Great movie encourage you while entertaining you!",10,2,3,8 June 2006
