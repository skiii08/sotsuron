The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Bitching Project
","This is utter garbage. All you have is three fools bitching at each other non-stop. I understand that the creators wanted to create a realistic feeling, but the bobbing and bouncing cameras did just the opposite.A suspension of disbelief is not enough here, something I try to encourage in others. A movie is just a movie after all. I was scared during the last 20-30 seconds of the movie, that's it.Rolling Stone magazine is quoted as calling this, 'scary as hell.' These are the same guys who panned Led Zeppelin's first album. Cripes. Instead of seeing this, go watch Eyes Wide Shut for a genuine, artful masterpiece.",2,0,2,2 January 2000
