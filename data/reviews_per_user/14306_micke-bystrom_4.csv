10 Cloverfield Lane," Build-up adequate, ending superficial
","This is only a variation of an old story where only some parameters are 'new' and the end tries so hard to be unique and surprising that it falls into in the comic territory. Hardly what was intended.The acting is pretty good in the small cast, but John Goodman have been so much better multiple times. Here he puts on a sufficient persona that is almost convincing. Mary Elisabeth does the most convincing work and John Gallagher Jr. is quite adequate, but could have gotten a better presentation.",4,0,0,10 March 2018
Sinister," Not buying it
","The basic outset is all-right. I started watching on Netflix assuming this was a murder story and found the build-up to about 50 minutes to be somewhat interesting and acting quite good.But when the clearly 'supernatural' made it's first appearance, in 2 video windows on the author's (Ethan Hawke) computer display I lost interest in the plot and I got rather angry too. Fusing horror and murder stories can be done in a good way — just look at 'Pan's Labyrinth' — but spirits pushing pixels? Please It's so BORING! Anyone with a computer can push pixels around. How's that supernatural? Why the anger? Well, killing people is something some other actual living people do. That's a scary story if told well as we know this can and do happen. Any supernatural aspect to this need to be sold to the audience. This movie totally fails selling the basic premise of the story it wants to tell. The experiences leading up to that supposedly 'supernatural' moment was not convincing at all, so this 'spirit edited' video just came off as cheap. Again, so BORING'!!!!! I can't finish boring movies. With so much compelling material to watch instead this is a must go. I regret wasting 50 minutes.Give me something to be scared of. Don't give me something checking the bullet points of Scott's imagined 'scary movie'. Bye Scott Derrickson! You're out.",2,0,3,14 April 2017
Jack Reacher," Not worth the time.
","The storyline has nothing of interest and the people act boringly. Even the villain is boring. Don't get me started on Tom's character. He plays Tom Cruise, which is boring, not a Jack Reacher. Maybe they are equally boring? A total waste of time. Make sure you make out at least if you're forced to a chance on this one.",4,0,0,13 July 2018
Signs," One of the least exciting Sci-fi movies ever made
","I'm a long standing Sci-fi fan, I totally love X-files, Star Trek Voyager, Matrix-trilogy, Alien 1, 2 and 3 and much else in this genre. I'm also not averted to Mel Gibson as an actor. However, this movie simply is too stupid, too unfrightening, contains too much bad acting as well as logical fallacies big enough to pass a transatlantic liner trough and in addition is too laughable to be taken as anything but a really sad joke. I don't think I've been as disappointed since the ending of 'The Abyss'.I will not repeat all the detailed complaints others have already mentioned however. This one simply is a must miss unless you love watching a pointless excuse of a film instead of a real movie.",1,7,13,10 September 2010
