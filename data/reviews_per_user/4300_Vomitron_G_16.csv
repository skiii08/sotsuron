Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The conclusion of a saga that can be described in three words: Pure Cinematic Art
","Don't expect KILL BILL: Vol 2 to be more of the same. Expect more, not the same. A good director knows the rules of movie-making (in particular scriptwriting). An excellent director knows how to bend and play with those rules. That's exactly what Quentin Tarantino does. Everybody knows he likes to mess around with continuity, but I'll vaguely give a more detailed example. At one point Tarantino builds in a set-up (or a clue, if you want) in the story-line. He then ignores this clue for a while only to deliver the pay-off at the exact moment the attentive viewer remembers the set-up. He does that on several occasions.Once again, I will not list all the things that I loved about this KILL BILL: Vol 2 ('cause the list would be almost infinite), but I did promise to point out some possible flaws.First of all (and this is not a flaw coming from the movie) it was a bad choice made by the production company to split this movie into two volumes. But since they did, Tarantino might have considered of dosing the talking and fighting more proportional. Now we have one volume with a lot of action and the second with a lot of plot-development. To me it still was good, but to fans of the first volume (who'd have to wait some time to see the sequel) it might be a bit of a let-down. This is why I recommend to see both volumes (4 hours!) in one take. That way you'll still feel the rush from the first volume during the second. And in its aftermath you'll find the time to catch your breath and get along with the story.Some viewers consider Tarantino a bit of a show-off. In a way like 'Look at all the things I can do' and 'Can you spot all the references to all the other films?'. Well, concerning the first statement, I'm all pro: Tarantino has talent, and if one has it, I'd like to see it. So, by all means, Mr. Tarantino, show 'em what you got. And so he did. As to the second statement: any real movie-buff loves spotting references. So bring it on. But it doesn't end there. Tarantino is a real comic-book fan and he likes to mention that rather unsubtle in his movies. I for one applaud that (I like comics too), but a lot of viewers find it redundant. But since he can do whatever he wants in his movies, he does it anyway. I just loved the scene were David Carradine does his monologue about Superman. You can clearly tell that Tarantino acted out that whole scene for Carradine, 'cause when you look at Bill, it's like Tarantino's doing all the talking. Very Amusing. So again, this is actually no flaw. It's just part of the Tarantino-legacy.One question remained after viewing the KILL BILL-saga. How in the world did Bill get a hold of the baby. It seemed plausible The Bride not knowing about it since she was in a coma and she fled the hospital before anyone could tell her. But it felt kinda weird that she didn't ask Bill about it and that he didn't talk about it either. But then again there was already enough talking as it was in volume 2.I can't think of anything else being wrong with KILL BILL. Actually, there isn't anything wrong with it. And I dare anyone to find me just one aspect about KILL BILL (from screenplay, acting, style, shooting-techniques to soundtrack) that isn't simply brilliant.",10,2,4,24 February 2006
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Packs about the same amount of punches as the other installments
","Paul W.S. Anderson is pretty much sticking to the formula here. It's the same zombie game, only on a different location. The two main locations this time being a towering building and a massive ship. And we get the usual adrenaline rushing zombie action. Somehow it feels a little less epic than the dusty, apocalyptic third installment, 'Extinction' (2007), which is still my favorite in the series, closely followed by the first movie. So it's simple: If you you're a fan of the 'Resident Evil' series, you'll have the same amount of fun with 'Afterlife' as you did with the previous outings. Amongst the highlights this time are Mila Jovovich crash-landing a plane on top of a building and a cool & wet big zombie-mutant boss fight in the industrial showers. The whole series is up there with the more entertaining & better executed zombie movies we've had coming out in recent years. And we've had many of those. For a 4th installment, it ain't bad at all. So keep 'em coming as long as Mila Jovovich is game; I'll be watching 'em.",7,1,4,12 June 2012
Hostel," Hostel Paradiso
","When Eli Roth's CABIN FEVER came out in 2002, the opinions amongst horror-fans were divided. Quentin Tarantino, however, claimed himself being a fan of Roth's debut, so he agreed on placing 'Quentin Tarantino presents' on the promotional poster for HOSTEL. Though he isn't in any other way associated with the making of this film, it did result in the fact that HOSTEL is now receiving a wide-scale theatrical release across Europe. Smart move, Mr. Roth.HOSTEL's story-line isn't too complicated. Two American backpackers, Paxton and Josh, are travelling across Europe together with Oli, a friend from Iceland. In Amsterdam they're being told that Slowakia is a real paradise for backpackers because it's the country with the most beautiful and well-willing European woman. The horny three-some wastes no time and heads off to Slowakia. At their arrival, they check in at a paradise-like little hotel and hook up with Natalya and Svetlana. And indeed, the women are gorgeous and the sex is splendid. But little do they know that they're about to descent in the underground world of organized crime and torture-tourism as they will be confronted with mankind's darkest and sickest nature.The subgenre in which HOSTEL pleasantly revolves itself has been around for a long time. It all started in the 60's with the making of the first gore-movies and continued during the 70's and 80's with the release of numerous exploitation-films and shock-horror features. During the 90's such movies vanished from the horror-scene. In the new millennium the sadistic reality-horror genre is back, and the first thing we notice is that it's much more stylishly portrayed. The genre got a considerable boost with movies like SAW and Takasi Miike's ICHI, THE KILLER. The screenplay of HOSTEL is a bit less intelligent than afore-mentioned movies, but director Eli Roth clearly knows what a horror-fan wants to see, and therefore he delivers the goods. In other words: Expect a LOT of female nudity and bloody gore. During the first part of HOSTEL you actually have the impression that you're watching the umpteenth teensex-comedy, so the sudden blow to the head is as hard as it gets when this movie starts showing off with its disgusting torture-scenes. The bloody make-up effects are done by Greg Nicotero and, as to be expected, excellent and believable. Except maybe one make-up effect seemed not too realistic and reminded me a bit of those early 80's Italian zombie-movies (I think you'll know it when you see it). But it was fun anyway.I have to tell it like it is: Eli Roth has improved as a film-maker. Not only does he seem to have taken some lessons in script-writing, making him aware of things like '3-acts-structure' and 'point of no return'; he has even learned how to build some suspense in certain scenes. Okay, the plot may contain some unbelievable coincidences, but if we make up the over-all score, we have a very decent, politically incorrect horror-movie that's recommended for gore-hounds. I might be over-rating it a bit, but it's just that I had so much fun with it and it is a solid improvement over Roth's debut CABIN FEVER.",8,1,3,19 February 2006
Resident Evil: Extinction," Never thought Post-Apocalyptic Horror with Zombie Birds would be this decent
","Oh yes, I enjoyed 'Resident Evil: Extinction' quite a bit. I liked the first one, nothing wrong with it really. I was a little bit disappointed with how the second one turned out, on some levels. But this third one really felt to me like it put the whole concept and storyline back on the rails again. As far as that goes, the post-apocalyptic setting - and me being a sucker for it - had even little to do with it. But in general, yes, it did grab a hold of me. For such a setting, it totally had the right look & feel, just like it should. The zombie crows were undeniably cool, whether you liked them or not. A bit sad they only had them featured in one action scene. What I did like about the previous film, was the hint at the ending regarding Milla's character developing telekinetic abilities. I was really satisfied to see a bit more of them in this film. I'm granting 'Extinction' a whole extra point for the sole reason it managed to entertain me the most out of all three films so far. Unexpectedly, this turned out my favorite so far. Not bad, for a third film. And for once, I don't mind seeing a horror franchise go on, as I have some hopes now for 2010's 'Afterlife' installment. And I fear the day they'll write Milla Jovovich out of the series. I hope they'll call it quits before that ever happens.",8,2,4,16 September 2009
Cloverfield," A concept that isn't new or refreshing,... but it worked all the same.
","The first 20 minutes or so of the movie, it wasn't the camera work that got on my nerves (it never did, really), but the characters who were introduced to us. Yes, I know, it was necessary, as we're supposed to feel for them, care about their problems, pick up on the romances & sex-talk, etc. etc. But I still saw nothing but a group of shallow twenty-somethings that had nothing substantial to say. Just a bunch of wealthy, modern day yuppies. Not exactly the most interesting social group of our population (although they always think they are). Why not have different groups of people (filming the events with digi-cams & cellphones) and have a couple of their story-lines cross each other at some point. Would have made things a lot more interesting, if you ask me. So, considering this film's high rating on here, I think most people fail to see that behind CLOVERFIELD's impressive façade, there's a better film hidden that simply wasn't made (or the film-makers didn't think about making). Just look at the Korean THE HOST, and you'll know what I mean with a better film. More interesting characters and better monster action. In CLOVERFIELD the monster didn't even form a direct threat for the main characters. There never was any interaction between them and the giant beast. So, one could argue that this isn't really a monster movie, but pretty much an old school disaster flick. Either way, what eventually saved the film, was its up-tempo pace. Aside from the lingering opening 20 minutes, the events followed one another tightly enough.The special effects were fine and the action throughout the film decent enough. And with the hand-held camera swooping around, rest assured: It's not at all nauseating and there are enough shots where you can get a decent look at the giant beast (and some other thingies too). But the only way CLOVERFIELD works, is when you don't think about things. When you do, you'll discover flaws or think of things you would've preferred to have seen handled differently. You'll basically discover scenes & shots that are just too conveniently set up, too well-directed and just aren't very realistic (and with docu-style realism being the complete blue-print of this film, you can consider that a flaw). To add to the implausibility, the character who's filming all the footage practically filmed like everything the whole time. I doubt in reality anyone would be able to do that when trying to save your own life and that of your friends. To 'solve' this problem, the scriptwriters just had him say things like 'I'm documenting! I have to document this! I'll keep on documenting!' one too many times. It had me thinking 'Yes, I know this is supposed to be real found footage', so instead of enforcing the authenticity of it all, it kind of took me out of the action and made me more aware of the fact that it was just a normal movie. I'm sure I wasn't the only one experiencing this.But who gives a damn about these minor quibbles. I even ended up being forgiving, because I did enjoy the ride. So, regardless, CLOVERFIELD still is a fine GODZILLA-inspired monster-flick. And due to its bleak ending (of which we already get a pretty good hint because of the footage having been labeled 'The Area Formerly Known As Central Park' at the beginning of the film), it's a whole lot less sappy than Roland Emmerich's blockbuster from 1998. That one 'feelgood summer hit-film' true GOJIRA fans refuse to speak of and had the tag-line 'Size Does Matter'. At any rate, if you take out the popcorn and switch off your brain, you can have fun with both films. Big, dumb, loud, stomping grounds & levelling buildings. Works for me. The only real problem with both CLOVERFIELD and the American GODZILLA, is that they also pretend to be something else. Delusions of grandeur. Happens in all lines of work, I guess. I can forgive that if enough entertainment is provided.Oh yes, why isn't this concept not all that new or refreshing? Just check out a film like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST (1980). Heck, the concept of a 'faux documentary' even goes back to the days of silent film-making, with a film like HÄXAN (1991). So, BLAIR WITCH PROJECT may deserve some credit, but sure as hell not all of it.",7,0,0,5 November 2009
Crash," Life is a healing process
","**** I have to get one thing of my chest first, concerning some reviewers here on this movie's web-page: I've read several comments of reviewers who hate this movie that were shockingly insulting. I felt personally offended. They actually have the nerve to explicitly insinuate that everyone who likes this movie is lacking intelligence, shallow or just plain stupid. I saw CRASH together with my brother and we both thought it was nothing short of being excellent. We are actually regarded as being well-educated persons (with a love for cinema in general), so who are you to call us morons? I kindly, yet firmly, ask all of you so-called intellectuals to refrain yourselves from such insulting statements in the future (since you're not likely to come back here and remove or edit your posts). ****Ensemble-pictures have become a genre of their own and I myself have still to encounter the first bad one in this genre. CRASH can be compared to a lot of movies, but I don't think Iñárritu's 21 GRAMS is one of them (For the record: I think 21 GRAMS is a masterpiece and CRASH is 'just' excellent). I really love it when a movie demands the attention of the viewer. And I'm even more pleased when that attention is rewarded on several occasions. Some events in CRASH are predictable but you can never exactly predict how the events will occur or what the outcome will be. I hate to break the news to all of you who hate this movie, but that's clever scriptwriting. The whole cast gives a more than decent performance, even though not all of them are first-rate talents.I'm not going to praise this movie by telling you all the things I liked about it, but instead I'm going to explain why I didn't give it 10 out of 10 stars. For example, on at least two occasions I had the feeling that writer/director Paul Haggis underestimates the intelligence of the viewer. After the pay-off of the initial set-ups, Haggis often shows us totally redundant shots of things we already know (the address on the dashboard, the blanks in the red box). The viewer is perfectly capable of figuring that out by himself. Also, I did find the whole racism-theme too dominant throughout the movie. Simply every character has issues with it to that point it almost becomes annoying. This movie is about so many other things too, so Haggis could have easily put more emphasis on those other subjects. On a final note, I sometimes felt the musical score was a bit inappropriate.In the end those are just minor problems. CRASH simply is an excellent movie and one that deserves to be seen. I must add, however, even if the characters all felt 100% realistic, the actual events portrayed in CRASH don't always reflect real life (in my opinion). But then again it is still a movie. If you liked Altman's SHORT CUTS and Anderson's MAGNOLIA, then CRASH might be right up your alley. And if you liked them all, then please take the effort to watch Tom Barman's ANYWAY THE WIND BLOWS, one of the finest movies to come out of Belgium for a long time. One more thing about CRASH: It does contain at least one basic truth about life: You Live, You Learn, You Change.",9,3,11,4 March 2006
The Aviator," Great movie, but no masterpiece
","This comment on THE AVIATOR deals with the motion picture itself, not with its biographical aspects, since I know too little of the facts concerning Howard Hughes' life.I can say right away that this movie kept my interest, even with its 170 minutes running time. In fact, I wouldn't have mind to see it even a bit longer by adding a few scenes concerning the controversy and release of Hughes' movie 'The Outlaw'. I eagerly wanted to know more about it. When looking at the story, Scorsese choose to ignore the common rules of scriptwriting. Understandingly, since this is a biography. The film has a spectacular opening, then is toned down a bit and uses a slower pace when it comes to the development of events.Leonardo DiCaprio took some time to convince me as Howard Hughes. Don't get me wrong, 'cause in this movie he really proves what a great actor he is, no doubt (pun intended, get it?) about that. But it's just that I found him a bit too young to portray Howard Hughes, especially since he doesn't seem to age much throughout the movie. But he did a very good job on portraying Hughes' mental decay. I wasn't quite too fond on the way Cate Blanchett played Katharine Hepburn. She came on a bit too strong and slightly unlikeable. Maybe this was an accurate portrayal of Ms. Hepburn, but since I'm not very familiar with that actress, I rest my case. The rest of the acting was, as to be expected, very good.I also liked the way the cinematography showed a lot of different tones in color, hereby indicating the different episodes in the time-line of the story. The CGI of the airplane could have used a little more detail, if you ask me. There was even a big error, easily spotted. When Hughes has his attempt to set a new speed-record, the close-up shots of the airplane (with DiCaprio in it) show an open cockpit. The more distant CGI-shots show a closed cockpit. Also DiCaprio's hair doesn't move while flying with an open cockpit (but when he crashes in the field, it does). A few other unrealistic shots are to be found when it comes to special effects, but I won't bother going into them.I ended up liking this movie more than I expected, but it didn't have the same impact as, for example, A BEAUTIFUL MIND (which I consider to be a much better movie). So THE AVIATOR is just a great movie, but certainly no masterpiece.",8,3,4,1 March 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Quentin Tarantino surpassed himself with this one
","Quentin Tarantino has arrived to a point in his career where he can simply do anything he wants (and gets away with it too). And by all means, he has earned that right. He went from a modest video-clerk with a love for comic books to one of the most versatile film-makers ever to walk the face of this earth. I simply won't be told otherwise. He knows movies (the Classics and the Junk) and he knows how to make one. I won't even go into the story, or the visuals. Nor won't I go into the things I really liked or point out where he got his ideas and which films he pays homage to or makes fun of. I won't list the different genres this movie blends in the mix (but there are a lot, and I'll only tell that he also uses Japanese anime for one chapter, which can compete with the best manga out there, in terms of drawings and motion) and I will not talk about the flaws the KILL BILL-saga has (yes, there are flaws and I will see to them in my KILL BILL: Vol. 2 comment).I will just say KILL BILL: Vol. 1 is a must-see thrill ride, which perfectly portrays, exaggerates and perfects Tarantino's style of film-making that I've come to love over the years. This is Tarantino's ultimate take on the 'revenge-flick'-theme and he makes sure this sub-genre rises to new solitary heights. As to the complaint of some viewers who state that a lot of events in KILL BILL are illogical and unrealistic I can only say one thing: This is a movie created in an environment free from limitations and as a cinematographic experience it pushes the boundaries of modern-day film-making. Therefore it is by definition granted the defiance of logic, for being bound by logic restrains oneself from pushing boundaries (and you can quote me on that). I'll leave it at that. Or maybe one more important thing: I recommend seeing the two KILL BILL-volumes (the whole experience) in one take (perhaps with one cigarette-break in between), like it was intended. Why? I'll explain in my comment for KB: Vol. 2.",10,0,2,24 February 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Burton & Dahl: A marriage made in heaven
","I didn't exactly know what to expect going into this movie, except for the fact that it would surely feature Tim Burton's distinctive visionary directing skills and also that I knew for sure Johnny Depp wouldn't let me down (since he has never done that before). And, as to be expected, I got all that, but also a whole lot more out of this movie. Of course I knew the story already and I had seen fragments of the 1971-version with Gene Wilder when I was a very little kid. But this fantastic candy-trip into chocolate wonderland succeeded all the expectations I might have had.I'll just keep this short and sweet, because I don't think I can add anything that hasn't been written before. Here are some things that managed to surprise me in an utmost positive way. For one thing: Danny Elfman's score. Now, calling me not a big fan of musicals would be something like the understatement of the year. But here the songs didn't annoy me at all. In fact, they were great. Elfman and Burton went all pretty nuts on this one using a lot of different musical genres. My favorite song must have been the one in the 'Invention Room'-scene. The style of the song features characteristics of Blaxploitation themes, P-funk and even some of that rocky funkiness The Red Hot Chili Peppers used to have. The other songs are very different in tone, and they only come up whenever a child meets its 'demise'. So the fact that there are only 4 songs in the movie, also helped to appreciate them a little more.Another thing that amazed me was how great the acting performances from the 5 kids were (something I wasn't too impressed with in the first HARRY POTTER-movie, for example). Especially Freddie Highmore (Charlie), Julia Winter (Veruca) and AnnaSophia Robb (Violet) were amazing. No doubt about it that a successful acting career lies ahead for those kids. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka was simply delicious and the whole cast for that matter was excellent. I didn't mind some of the side characters weren't fully drawn out, because to me this movie is about the 5 kids and Willy Wonka (& his Factory). I also liked the side-plot about Wonka's childhood and the relationship with his father (portrayed by Christopher Lee). It sort of drew the whole movie a bit more open and made Johnny Depp's character more human (because all the scenes inside the Factory made him extremely surreal, which I liked of course, but still...). The things writer John August & Tim Burton added to the screenplay seemed to stay really true to the spirit of Roald Dahl's original story. Dark & twisted, yet friendly & humorous.And then, of course, the set-design & set-pieces were amazing. It simply is every director's dream to work with a crew that talented. CGI was put to good use (sometimes you couldn't even tell what was there on the set and what was created with the computer). The 'Squirrel'-scene was highly memorable (using real trained squirrels, puppetry & CGI, which all blended together fabulously). And the ending was satisfying too. A little detail I liked was the way some kids came out of (or survived) the Factory at the end. It reminds you once again that this is a Tim Burton-movie and not a Disney-flick. I was contemplating giving this movie 9/10 (I don't even know why really, since nothing in the movie annoyed me, and it seemed completely flawless to me), but then I saw the second DVD with the extras (it contains a little documentary about the life of Roald Dahl, some very interesting 'making of'-features and some funny & silly games you can play with your remote control). And because of all that, I generously donate that extra point that will make this movie a Burton-masterpiece.",10,0,3,4 December 2006
The Mummy Returns," The Same Cast & Crew Returns
","When you look at what Stephen Sommers first 'The Mummy' movie delivered, 'The Mummy Returns' is a perfectly acceptable sequel. We get more adventure, more action and more cartoonish horror. A blend that simply manages to entertain in an unpretentious fashion with nothing more to it. Even more so than the first film was, 'The Mummy Returns' is a CGI/SFX oozing fest in the adventurous vein of the legendary 'Indiana Jones' movies. Only with mummies and other fantastic shenanigans this time. It's big budget summer blockbuster fun, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. The same cast & crew returns and delivers the goods a second time. By now Fraser & Weisz's characters have a kid, so you'll just have to take him along for the ride. Naturally, this also means that the film is intended for a very wide target audience, so all the violence & horror in this film is virtually bloodless, rather aimed to be enjoyable & spectacular than frightening or gruesome. The two films can easily be watched back-to-back for 4 hours of fast-paced entertainment. Or you can go watch a 90 minutes artfilm instead. The choice is yours.",7,0,0,22 September 2011
Groundhog Day," One of Bill Murray's finest
","This is it folks. Comedy doesn't get much better than this. Danny Rubin's screenplay is funny and intelligent. Bill Murray easily gives one of his best performances and is perfectly cast. This is simply the best comedy Harold Ramis ever made up to now. This movie has had so many positive comments that there isn't much left to say actually. So I'm just here to throw in my two cents. Though the concept of reliving the same day over and over again is rather original to base a comedy on and the movie is build up flawless, having a lot of funny situations, it still is Bill Murray, with his almost natural sarcasm, that is the main attraction of this movie. I possibly couldn't have imagined another actor playing weatherman Phil Connors. Andie MacDowell was also perfect as Rita, the producer who was practically the complete counterpart of Phil. To put it simple: She loves life, Phil hates it. It even felt okay when those two become romantically involved at the end, 'cause you really want them to (with Rita having such a positive effect on Phil and all).Scriptwriter Danny Rubin really explores every single possible thing one can do when there are absolutely no consequences the next day. Needless to say the possibilities are endless and this movie never becomes boring. Then why am I not rating it 10 out of 10 stars, you might ask. Well, the whole 'grumpy, egocentric person becoming a better man'-thing was a bit obvious. And there's another thing: the fact that Phil falls in love with Rita was totally plausible. After all he's got all the time in the world to get to know here. But Rita only had one day to get to know him. So it's a bit silly for her to, at the end of that day, agree with him to rent a house in Punxsatawney and having his kids. Well, it actually isn't suggested in such an explicit way, but still... You get the idea. But then again, this is a romantic comedy (with an underlying supernatural theme), and one of the best ones out there. And I also liked the fact that the phenomenon of the re-occurring Groundhog Day isn't explained in the end. Nice move, Mr. Rubin. GROUNDHOG DAY certainly is a movie that one can watch over and over, again and again. And who knows, you might even become a better person yourself after watching it.",9,0,1,20 February 2006
The Descent," Descent into madness
","When I read the synopsis for THE DESCENT, I thought to myself 'This is just like THE CAVE, only with chicks (er, excuse me, an all-female cast)'. Now, the concept of a bunch of hot-looking young women who are into extreme sports does sound appealing, but the real reason why I wanted to watch this movie was because I very much enjoyed director Neil Marshall's previous film DOG SOLDIERS. And let me say right away: Though I kinda liked THE CAVE, THE DESCENT is a far better movie. It has more suspense and is more realistic, to name only two things.The plot maybe isn't extremely original but it is executed perfectly and the over-all structure is flawless. The opening-scene is very powerful and will make you go 'Holy Sh!t?!?!'. It grabs your attention. Once inside the cave Marshall starts building up tension, very slowly (and I do mean slowly). After about 50 minutes the action kicks in, and it's a real thrill-ride. All leading up to a clever and satisfying ending. Between all this madness there's even a nice twist in the plot concerning one of the character's background. In short: This movie grabs you, pulls you in and doesn't let go until the end-credits roll.The middle-part of the movie feels more like a survival-movie (and that's a trick Marshall also uses in DOG SOLDIERS, blending genres), because everything you'd expect to go wrong while exploring a cave does indeed go wrong: Getting stuck & claustrophobia kicking in, a cave collapsing, crossing a ravine, breaking a leg (in a bloody-open-fracture kinda way),... And just when our six girls start to think that things couldn't possible get any worse, they find out the hard way that much bigger problems are lurking in the dark...There's a lot of blood & gore in this movie, especially in the second half. The make-up effects are rather excellent and the Crawlers, with their scary noises, look real creepy. Only complaint is that they still looked a little too human (their bodies, that is, not their actions). Some scenes are digitally enhanced, but you barely notice it. The sets all look real and the lighting is cleverly used. For instance, when the group gets divided, Marshall uses different lighting (like green flares, red torches,...) to indicate which person you're looking at in order to avoid any confusion. Never at any moment does the lighting feel artificial, so it works. Even some of the jump-scenes actually work. The musical score's almost perfect, never too dominant but adding to the atmosphere and raising the movie to a higher level.Neil Marshall clearly knows how to make good horror-movies and I strongly believe this director's going places. This is one of the best British horror-movies I've seen in a long time and one that proves once again that you don't need a big budget to make a good movie. So if you like violent horror, then go see this flick. And remember: Darkness won't kill you; what's in it will!",9,23,42,31 January 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Probably the most impressive war movie ever to come out of the 50's
","I am by far not a connoisseur when it comes to war movies. It's not even my favorite genre. But recently I've been catching up with a lot of classics my father likes so much. I had seen THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI before as a little kid, and now revisited it through a bit more experienced eyes. A lot of great reviews are written here on these pages, and maybe this film really comes close to being 10/10 material. But since I haven't really watched that much old war classics, I'm not going to attempt to write an in-depth review and just provide some random impressions in this user-comment instead.How many times have you seen deleted scenes on a DVD where the director explains it was cut out 'for pacing issues, really'? Well, I'm convinced half of the time they're actually trying to say 'the producers were afraid audiences might find our movie boring if we left too much in it'. A lot of these deleted scenes 'cut out to improve the pacing' could have easily been left in the film. But last week, I felt quite differently while watching THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The first hour of the movie actually felt too long (mind you, not too slow, but more like certain scenes went on too long and the plot didn't really progress like it should have). We're talking a movie here that runs about 160 minutes and I'm 100% sure if this film would have been made today, they would have cut out more than half an hour of footage from that first half. And not only because films have changed so much over the years and everything has to go fast. At first, the stretched out first half of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. felt like a flaw, but the movie's second half made me reconsider this. The plot shifts focus, and concentrates on an escaped Prisoner Of War, who fled from the camp and becomes part of a team sent back in to go and blow up the bridge. Suddenly, during the part of his recovery at a military hospital, the screenplay injects quite a bit of humor (the conversation between Warden and his superior officers about him not receiving parachute-training was a wonderful highlight) and from then on, when their mission starts, the film gets much more exciting. It made me appreciate the first hour more for the establishing reasons it was used for, and also because - to my surprise - the shifting in tone and pace worked wonders. There's so much you could go into if you're looking to praise this film. Needless to mention what a fine performance Alec Guinness and other cast members gave, so I'll just point out how impressed I was when I saw the movie's climax. They way the script builds up to it, is one thing. Taking the time to lay out a strategy and incorporating the notion that this whole mission might even go terribly wrong at one point, successfully increases tension during those final scenes. But the fact that the filmmakers completely destroyed a real bridge and a real train...? No use of miniatures or other special effects. Now which movies made today would actually have the courage to show us something like that? Simply none. Those days are over.The only thing I would have preferred, is having seen the first half of the film injected with a slightly more grim mood, because frankly, that cheerful (and very famous) whistle-tune of the prisoners and some of the fanfare-esquire parts of the musical score got on my nerves a bit. I'll just blame that on the fact that this foremost still is a Hollywood movie. And that's just the way anyone will have to take this film, regardless it was based on (and altered) real facts of war. From a historical point of view, the film might be insufficiently accurate, but it really feels like one of the greatest and most entertaining war-movies ever made.",8,1,3,22 May 2009
Dodgeball," 'Dodgeball' goes pretty far in not taking itself too seriously
","I probably hadn't seen this flick if it wasn't for the recommendation of a friend. I'm glad I did, 'cause it's funny as hell. Stupid fun, it is. First of all, I used to really hate Ben Stiller. Basically, I still don't like his face and his way of acting. But since I enjoyed MEET THE FOCKERS to some extend, I kinda took Stiller along for the ride with this one. And he's pretty superb in DODGEBALL, giving an over-the-top performance as prestigious fitness-club owner White Goodman. In fact he's so annoying, dislike-able and full of himself that I constantly wanted to hit him in the head. Real hard. So it was fun to see him suffer some defeats from time to time. But especially Vince Vaughn was good as the very likable, easy-going Peter La Fleur, White's rival in the fitness-business. There's not much else to say about this flick, except: go see it. It's got funny dialogues and one-liners including a lot of vulgar and offensive words. And there are also enjoyable cameo-parts by Chuck Norris, William Shatner, David Hasselhof (the best!) and even Lance Armstrong. If someone throws this movie at you, don't dodge, but catch and watch it!",7,0,1,1 March 2006
High Fidelity," An unmatched romantic comedy in my book
","I watched it for the third time and it's still one of my favorite comedies ever. Intelligent and witty. A romantic comedy about relationships in a city. A touch of sadness, some genuine laughs and a lot of struggles. Well, actually, a film about girls, music and vinyl records. And more.What I like most about 'High Fidelity', is the way it stands out amongst other romantic comedies. Most of these are either aimed at teenagers or for adults. Those teen romance comedies often tend to follow a clichéd, formulaic path heading for a happy ending. Those about adult relationships, often add a bit of drama & violins at proper times, to which you can set a timer. Not too keen about that either.But the ways of 'High Fidelity' are much more original and both younger (those entering their first relationship) & older audiences (those who've had a few) should be able to relate to certain aspects. It's also not telling that good old story of 'boy meets girl', but when the film begins, we're already stepping into a relationship with a lot of issues. It's pretty unpredictable, has a unique & clever way of telling the story (John Cusack often rambling on straight into the camera, flash-backs, flash-forwards), incorporates lots of cool stuff for music-lovers and above all, it's realistic, recognisable and pretty damn funny too. On a technical level (directing, acting, cinematography, editing, sound, etc), it's simply perfect. Films of this ilk, don't come much better than this.",9,0,1,3 February 2010
The Island," Attack of the clones
","Of all the Michael Bay-movies I've seen, there's only one I liked and that's THE ROCK. But with THE ISLAND I can add a second one to the list. It's a rather good sci-fi/action-movie of the same size as, for instance, I, ROBOT. Only, THE ISLAND is a bit more believable and realistic. It actually is thought-provoking and raises some ethical issues about the whole cloning theme (and others too).I won't give a synopsis, 'cause the less you know about the plot, the better. Even seeing the trailer first spoils some things. The first fifteen minutes or so of the movie had me thinking 'Nice, but I'm not buying it'. But very soon (even sooner than Ewan McGregor does) you'll figure out that things aren't what they seem. McGregor and Johansson are attractive as the lead characters and deliver a solid performance. Even though Johansson hasn't got much to do in her roll as Jordan Two Delta, you can still she that she has grown as an actress since, for example, GHOST WORLD. Steve Buscemi is always good, no matter what the man does. The cinematography and special effects are nothing less than excellent, as to be expected with a Michael Bay-movie. There was a perfect mix between present day and futuristic technology, which was all in all believable. But maybe they should have made the time-setting the year 2050 instead of 2019. The spectacular car-chase (with the truck and all) was certainly one of the high-lights of the movie. And it got even better when they switched vehicles, taking the action literally to new heights. What bugged me a little bit, however, was: How could Lincoln Six Echo, with his lack of experience, possibly be a better pilot than those professionals? Because he clearly was, since he managed to shake them off. Oh well, you shouldn't mind and just enjoy the ride, I suppose.Michael Bay clearly is an American 'pur sang'. And that's one of the things I'd like to hold against him. That characteristic of him very much shows itself in the redundant last half hour of THE ISLAND when Bay shoves us all sorts of politically correctness down our throat. Me giving examples would spoil too much, so judge it for yourself. I'll only say that the final 'freedom'-shot (even though quite impressive) made me go 'Oh, please, noooo'. THE ISLAND actually should have ended with Lincoln and Jordan accepting their new identity, having the viewer decide what happens next. Granted, it would not be a spectacular ending as the one Bay came up with, but still Again, you shouldn't mind too much though, 'cause this is Michael Bay's THE ISLAND and not Michael Winterbottom's CODE 46.Also, that last half hour contains the most unbelievable plot-elements of all (the hidden gun, too easily triggered explosions, no burn-marks when exposed to fire,...). So once again it's action over logic, but that's always the case with big-budget-popcorn-flicks, isn't it?Finally, I might add that at one point or another THE ISLAND reminded me of Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD, LOGAN'S RUN, THE MATRIX, MINORITY REPORT and the afore-mentioned I, ROBOT. I must stress out the fact that THE ISLAND isn't a copy of any of those movies, but it just borrows some ideas & elements from them and simply reminds you of them. So if you liked those stories and movies, than THE ISLAND is right up your alley. And that goes the other way round too",7,0,0,12 February 2006
