Source Code," An entertaining film
","'Source Code' is a enjoyable sci-fi adventure about time travel. The film just has a few characters and two locations, but it has a good rhythm and the actors do a good work.However, the film has some important flaws. First at all, it remembers to much to 'Groundhog Day' (1993) in some parts. When the main character tries to do everything perfect at the end, it's impossible not to thing in the Bill Murray's character.Second, the happy end doesn't work. This film is a good thriller and a interesting sci-fi story, but the end is just a fairy tale.Finally, all the story is about how the hero survives his own dead. But the main character is usurping some else body! He is 'killing' somebody and stealing his life to survive. And he falls in love with a girl who really doesn't know. Actually, she is not in love with him - is in love with the man whose body is possessed by the main character. She is tricked to love him! In conclusion, it's an entertaining film but with some important flaws.",6,1,2,22 November 2014
