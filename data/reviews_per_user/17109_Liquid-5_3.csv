The Blair Witch Project," Intensely frightening and disturbing....
","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]I've seen a lot of comments on this site about this movie saying it wasn't scary, or that there was no plot, or that the dialogue was dumb because it was made up. I guess it's easy to understand how some people would say that, with the way horror films are run and made and promoted now. I'm an avid horror fan myself, I love the flicks. And any that really ever scared me, the few that have, I always rationalized and got rid of my fear. Like saying to myself, 'Ah, those guys live in Indiana, that can't happen here,' or, 'Well, no big deal, they killed the thing, it can't get me now.' The only movie that still terrifies me that I can't put the fear out of is The Exorcist. Why? No way to say it couldn't happen. The reality is that that particular film shows you a real case of something that you have no defense over. If you believe in the Devil, then that movie is a terror simply because it says that no matter where you are, hey, you could be taken over by this thing. That's scary, man. Blair Witch is very similar. It doesn't really scare you, in the way that it constantly makes you jump or hits you in the face with some terrifying thing, or monster. Instead, it erodes at your security and your disbelief. When the movie starts, you think they'll go off, and see some scary thing, and blah blah blah. But much like real life, it's never that simple. The greatest power that Blair Witch uses on you is that you can actually believe in what is happening. No huge monster is ever shown, no real proof of what is going on is presented. And there lies the strength. You believe what you want to, and no matter what you decide, you can defend that opinion. The improvised dialogue only strengthens the realism of the film. Would you really buy into the premise of a movie claiming it was real if the actors were spouting tired lines like, 'These woods are quiet...too quiet.' Instead, you have people saying what people in real life say when they are put in a situation they can't get out of and are placed in danger. We all revert back to scared animals when the situation is right, or wrong in this case, and that's what happens: These three people devolve into irrational behavior and let overriding fear determine what they do. This film is unique in how it defies any common genre label; to call it a horror film is a slant because you imply it fits in with the classic definition of a horror film. Calling it a thriller, thought, takes away some of its credit. It's simply a movie that will leave you disturbed, thinking of what it would be like to be in that situation. If you liked it, you'll look at the woods around you, just the night itself, in a new way. If you hate it, you usually think how you'd have reacted differently in that scenario. Either way, the movie makes you take a new look around you and at how you think. That alone gives it a large amount of worth that few movies made today can match.",Null,1,2,26 August 1999
The Transporter," This movie is total garbage
","Few films bring to mind gold standard by which all bad movies are measured. The gold standard? Dante's Peak, of course. That film demonstrated a total lack or respect for the viewer, not only offending through a total swiss cheese plot, but also by blowing all sense of reality through the window. The Transporter is in this category of poor films. The first 15 minutes actually lulled me into a false sense of happy expectation. Yes, it was ripped off of Ronin, but a good car chase is still a good car chase.Once the car chase stopped, though, the crap began. I think that there was a plot somewhere in the movie, but I can't be entirely sure since they dropped what felt like plot elements in every 20 minutes or so and never really explained them. I doubt it was a very good plot anyway, you don't hide plots that are sound between useless action sequences. That's ok, though, it's hard to care about a plot when you can't find anyone in the film to sympathize with. The Transoporter was a hollow and emotionless character, first not really caring about the woman in the trunk and suddenly lusting for her, after several times declaring she is nothing but problematic. Oh, yeah, I can see why he's ex-military since he puts a loose rope around her neck and lets her go out of sight to pee. Hey, guess what, not exactly razor sharp military intelligence there, pal.Then there's Chinese girl. She's a whore, and not exactly sure where her allegiances lie. At one point, she could saver the Transporter from a problematuic situation, but chooses instead to just look dumb. She jumps into bed with the Transporter ten minutes after meeting him, and doesn't exactly have a very clear picture of how she sees her father. Anyhow, it might actually be worth seeing this at some point. I have no doubt it will make every movie you've ever thought was bad seem that much better, as this is truly a Batman & Robin level piece of trash.",2,2,3,19 October 2002
The Matrix," A modern Blade Runner, a sci-fi milestone
","The Matrix is one of an increasingly rare breed of sci-fi films: it delivers in every department. Most of the hype surrounding this movie was built on the word that the special effects and action sequences were unbelievable. And, as sometimes happens, the hype turned out to be true. The fighting scenes in this movie leave little to be desired, as they exhibit a flow, choreography and elegance that evokes images of the John Woo style Hong Kong action genre at its best. And the special effects are so seamlessly fluid and well-done that one would be inclined to wonder if Star Wars may have a run for its money. However, the movie does not follow the all too common formula of simply relying on the action and special effects to keep an audiences interest. Instead, a solid and complex storyline backs up every bullet and punch thrown at the audience. And to make the story believable, top-notch performances from every cast member, notably Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and, surprise surprise, Keanu Reeves. The cinematography also shines in this film. Many of the shots are simply so iconic and beautiful that you marvel at how it would look in real life. All in all, this film is a truly amazing piece of work, and one not to be missed.",9,0,0,1 April 1999
