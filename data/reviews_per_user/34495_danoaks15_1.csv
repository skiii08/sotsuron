Requiem for a Dream," One of the most awful movies ever
","I'll never understand why so many reasonable people think so highly of this movie. It contains some of the worst dialogue ever written -- every sentence ends with a period and the speech has no flow or rhythm. The plot is so outlandish, it is more like Reefer Madness than real life. Darren Aronofsky directs movies for high school kids to watch and think that they are the only people smart enough to 'get it.'This movie is more of a public service announcement than an artistic endeavor, and the message of the film is one that every American kid learned in D.A.R.E -- Drugs are bad. If you want to watch something about addiction, watch the Wire or read Infinite Jest, but whatever you do don't waste your time watching this movie.",1,20,39,20 February 2012
