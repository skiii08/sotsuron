It," No more clowning around
","I finally got to check this out and, while it wasn't a terrible movie by any means, it was far from great.The performances were pretty much top notch across the board but the scares left a little to be desired and the CGI was god-awful at times.There were some truly incredible moments, but they were few and far between and just about any time the movie began to hold my interest for more than a few minutes it was quickly taken away from me again. As much as I love the true horror of the book, perhaps the movie was better left to the campiness of the original.I will, however, say bravo to Skarsgì±…rd for his portrayal of Pennywise, a performance that I daresay rivals that of Tim Curry.",5,1,2,27 August 2018
