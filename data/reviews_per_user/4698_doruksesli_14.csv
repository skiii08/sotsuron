The Mask," Ignore the 6.9 this movie is SMOKIN'!
","I was in shock when I saw the rating of this movie was a 6.9 when it clearly deserves to be at least a 9!!!!! Overall this is a great comedy and is enjoyable ( also great fun for the whole family ), definitely worth a watch!",8,10,11,27 December 2019
Gremlins," One of the best films I've ever seen!!!
","Don't mind the bad reviews this movie is breathtaking. The use of puppetry and stop motion in this movie is done very well , especially as it was made in the 80s, also the acting ( unlike what some people may say ) is not dull and really adds to the feel of the movie! The comedy and horror is perfectly balanced, scaring you but not so much that they can't fit in a joke!! This movie is great and I solely recommend this movie to everyone.",10,2,3,20 December 2019
The Irishman," A masterpiece
","This is just amazing, long but amazing. And I loved it! The story was engaging joe Pesci, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino did a great job and really brought this movie to life",10,3,7,2 February 2020
Elf," I don't understand how people dislike this movie!
","This film is just amazing! It's funny, keeps you on the edge of your seat and has a big ol ' Christmassy heart. When I first saw this I had some doubts but nearing the ending I f the film I had realised that this movie was amazing (you could say my heart grew three times the size it used to be*)
*a reference to how the grinch stole Christmas.",7,5,6,29 November 2019
The Lion King," Decent movie but doesn't live up to the original.
","This remake of the beloved Disney movie is actually pretty decent, the songs were generally good and the actors did a great job voicing the characters (especially Chiwetel Ejiofor who voiced scar) but the movie doesn't live up to the original that we all love and cherish for example the animals are so realistic that they don't even have facial expressions and I also believe that Disney lost the advantage of being able to create some of the most iconic scenes of the movie when they chose to go for live action!",3,0,0,17 November 2019
Men in Black II," No just no.
","This movie unlike the 1st and 3rd ones is a joyless cash grab, I was only 10 minutes in when I decided I couldn't take it anymore",4,0,0,27 January 2020
Coco," In my opinion, overrated!
","I know that people love this movie but I just don't understand why! It's overrated, I mean the songs are pretty decent but the story is nearly exactly the same as the book of life, and overall really not that great, it's ok.",6,0,0,3 April 2020
Joker," A masterpiece
","Dc studios has been making bad movies since the dark knight series (which was great) ended until now! Joker is amazing, it's dark , deep but somehow through all this depression it's actually funny (in some scenes)! People who find this movie boring and don't like it are just finding something to take their anger out on! If you find this movie boring then you probably won't like a lot of other movies, the shawshank redemption for example (its the top rated film of all time)! Joker is a masterpiece that blurs the line between reality and fiction, it's a serious movie with a serious message and I loved every last part of it! Defiantly a 10/10, I would recommend watching this.",10,6,10,17 February 2020
Whiplash," Beautiful.
","This is a moving, amazing and astounding movie!! I would definitely recommend watching this!",10,1,1,13 May 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," Worth a watch!
","This movie has its problems, such as some very unimportant dialogue, but nothing is perfect! This movie is entertaining and really makes you wonder about who did the crime and to top it all off the movie is left with a great ( but a bit confusing) twist.",6,2,10,10 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Wow !!!!!
","This movie is just purely amazing!! I loved every single second of it and i must say that the acting, the plot and the cast were great! This movie was balanced out perfectly, making it funny but sad at some points also! I would recommend this movie to anyone!!",10,2,5,3 January 2020
The Matrix," THE BEST FILM EVER MADE
","This movie is truly just mind blowing, with it's action packed sequences and kicking rebels this film has got it all! I would recommend the matrix to literally anyone! If you haven't seen the matrix than you're missing out in something am amazing!",10,1,2,17 November 2019
300," 10/10
","I had some doubts at the start but wow was I wrong, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen ( along with gremlins, the Irishman and the matrix ). This movie may seem like it's extremely just action packed ( and it is ) but not everything about it is just blood and gore, this is a story of love, war and loss. I would recommend this movie to ANYONE!",10,1,2,25 December 2019
The Simpsons Movie," Loved it
","I loved this, every second of it and I found it hilarious also what are these people saying about the dome on the town being unrealistic! IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE REALISTIC!!! I mean come on if you judge based on how real it is then some of the best films ever made don't make sense",9,2,3,24 January 2020
