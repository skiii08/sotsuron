Antz," One word, funny.
","ANTZ was a very pleasant surprise. I expected a more childish film, but ANTZ turned out to be a kind of adult humor. Unlike 'A Bug's Life' ( Coming out in Nobember)which is more childish this is more a, like I said before, adult humor film with Woody Allen and the rest. There are more talked jokes, kind of like Seinfeld. There are, too, political jokes. I enjoyed this film very much, and I'm sure you ( the person who's reading this.) will enjoy it too. The writers of this film did a good job.",9,0,0,17 October 1998
Se7en," It Will Keep You On The Edge Of Your Seat.
","Se7en is a smart movie, and I liked it. This movie a what I call a real thriller. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has a smart plot too.I really recommend it, it's good.",10,0,0,2 January 1999
Armageddon," Better than Deep Impact
","I don't know why critics said Deep Impact was better. Deep Impact was boring and long. Armageddon was more exciting and fun. I waited 2 hours for cool special effects in Deep Impact, and didn't have to wait that long in Armageddon. Dreamworks needs improvements on its blockbusters.",8,4,7,22 December 1998
Face_Off," Cool Movie!!!!
","Face/Off is one of the coolest action flicks I've seen. This movie has a strong plot, and a cool diologue. John Travolta and Nickholas Cage give a worthy performances. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes action movies. Face/Off was cool.",10,0,0,24 December 1998
A Bug's Life," A Great Movie
","When it comes to making great movies, the guys at Pixar know their stuff. A Bug's Life was one of the best movies I saw this year. The creative imaginations these guys have is very good. This movie easily compares to Toy Story, I can't wait 'till Toy Story 2.",9,0,0,6 December 1998
