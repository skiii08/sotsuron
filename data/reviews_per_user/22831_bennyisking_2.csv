Resident Evil: Afterlife," Solid Movie Worth Seeing
","Guys if your looking to see a carbon copy of the classic video game I think you should have realized by now that this isn't it. But it is one of the few series of movies that have been able to change the story around and still remain good. It is a great action film. Maybe because it was my first ever experience in an IMAX theater I am giving it an 8 but I highly recommend this film to anyone looking to be highly entertained. I think Milla Jovovich has proved herself to be a bona fide action star on top of that she is gorgeous. I actually think she is a better action star then most men right now. Can't think of any I'd rank in front of her. Action junkies, fans of the first 3 installments and people who love seeing hot chicks will love this movie. The movie may make you jump a couple of times but nothing too scary or disgusting quite simply put it's Action all the way. The movie has it's draw backs there is 0 character development and you are expected to know who Alice is going in. The other characters are really just there for Alice to have someone to interact with and for the zombies to have someone to kill. Unless you've played the game you won't realize that Shawn Roberts is supposed to be Albert Wesker, who by the way, looks EXACTLY like Albert Weker from the game. This will leave you wondering as to who this man and your left assuming that Alice simply has a personal issue with Umbrella which he is part of. I'd see the 1st 3 installments before seeing this movie. But even if you don't you'll have fun it's not that intricate of a plot where you'll even really care. By the way you'll see a part where Ali Later is all dirty then suddenly she appears on the plane gorgeous with make up and lipstick. Honestly while her character development is very weak she does compliment Mila Jovovich. The characters of Clair Redfield, Alice K-Mart and Luther West all compliment each other well could have done without Mr. Prison Breaks character, Chris Redfield, who always seems to play the same character nonetheless it's a really good movie worth seeing.",7,8,18,14 September 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," The Best Part of this Movie was the Trailer
","Where do I begin? Expecting to see some action as portrayed by the trailer I decided to go and see what I can now only describe as a very disturbed 12 year old girl's outlook on love.Firstly If you want to see vampires fighting werewolves don't waist your time with this movie. There is no werewolf for the first hour and a half and if there is 1 vampire sighting outside the first 10 minutes it's a lot.My biggest problem with this movie is that it is a movie about vampires and werewolves yet not 1 person is killed or even hurt in the whole movie. Dracula was a love story too and people die left and right. SO the whole 'it's a love story' argument doesn't work.Vampires vs Werewolves??? In an argument maybe... There may have been a brief scuffle but nothing serious especially considering that there are 2 monsters 1 super strong super fast vampire and 1 GIANT wolf who are supposed to be FIGHTING over the love of a girl. Listen I'm not sure how it is today but in my day when I was in high school and 2 guys liked a girl we scrapped. Not saying the winner would get the girl but there would be a physical altercation not stair downs and threats and people walking away. Maybe that's why society is so sensitive right now. I'll tell you this much if this movie was made in the 80's-90's the body count would have been off the chart and the amount of fight sequences would have been ridiculous.Now that I got that off my chest let me just say the violence would have been a welcomed distraction from the absurdity of this movie. 'Oh no! I'm 17 and I've already found the person I'm going to be with for the rest of my life but I can't be with that person so let me try and kill myself while my father sits around listening to me having panic attacks and does nothing.' Listen I didn't have a sister or anything but if I did and she decided to act like this I guarantee my mother would have beat the living sh*t out of her. I mean I think my mother would of beat her just for watching this movie then she would have beat me for letting her watch it. THis movie was Lame!!! and at the risk of sounding lame myself, what type of message are you trying to send these kids now days that if you don't get what you want out of a relationship you should just kill yourself??? Get over it they're 17, they don't know what the hell is going on in life. IN reality the girl would have been upset for about a week then she would have hooked up with whoever was available at the moment and forgot about the other idiot.My final problem with this movie. Calling it a 'Romance' or a movie about 'Love' doesn't quite hit the nail on the head. It's more of an obsession and an unhealthy obsession. If your significant other throws themselves off a ledge, crashes a motorcycle and knowingly/willingly writes letters to a person who never gets them just to feel like they are close to you or to emulate some sort of feeling you give them your going to call the police and a psychiatric ward and have that person institutionalized. You may even want to get a restraining order on that person.This movie gets a 3 just because the werewolf looks cool.",3,8,13,30 November 2009
