Lucky Number Slevin," IMHO Most Underrated film of all time.
","I was honestly in disbelief when I found that this film was not in the top 250 with a low, low rating of 7.8. This is almost certainly my favourite film of this genre easily contending with the likes of Snatch, L4yer Cake, Brick etc.It is essentially perfect. Any close analysis would give away certain features of the film because everything is linked; it features countless nuances, being endlessly intricate. The best thing about this film is that it subverts expectations: it does not conform to any one genre and it will always have you on the edge of the seat, assuming of course you pay attention and give it the respect it deserves. Organised crime, love, relationships, comedy; this movie has it all and I would heartily recommend it to anyone.",10,6,11,31 March 2010
