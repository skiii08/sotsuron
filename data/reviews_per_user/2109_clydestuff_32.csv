Alien 3," Fincher singlehandedly destroys what could have been a great series
","It is very rare that I rate a movie as low as I rate Aliens3 (one star out of ten).  There are lots of bad sequels in the history of film making, so that in itself is not unusual.  Yet it wasn't enough for David Fincher to make a mound of garbage such as this, in the process he felt it necessary to completely obliterate the Alien movies by totally disregarding everything that had come before his film.  I'm not saying he had to make the same kind of movie as the previous two films, but to kill two main characters in the first five minutes of a sequel, two characters that we had invested so much time in in Aliens, and to do it without blinking an eye is not only inexcusable, but makes Alien 3 so downbeat from the start, it's hard to care one iota about what comes afterward.  The closest thing I can compare it to would be if George Lucas had killed Princess Leia And Han Solo in the opening scroll of The Empire Strikes Back.  As if all this wasn't bad enough, there is not one character in this movie that we care about or gives us any reason to care about them.  They are just there to supply food fodder for the Aliens when they decide to pop out and move the plot along.  Then again, we see so little of any of the characters as Fincher decided not only to make a 'dark film' but to film it in the dark as well.  I guess this is what one calls atmosphere.  I call it covering up your big boo boo.Poor Sigourney Weaver.  She does try.  Yet we know so far in advance what is going to happen to Ripley, that we are not shocked or saddened by it.  We only know that after the hell she went through in the first two films, she sure deserved a lot better than this mess.When you singlehandedly destroy a great series, you get a one rating, and you get that one because I can't give you a zero.

Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas comes through in Episode One of his prequel
","As practically everyone else in the Universe did, I had eagerly anticipated the return of the Star Wars Saga.  It was a long sixteen years between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace, and for most of those years it actually seemed as if George Lucas would never get back to his epic space opera.  During that time though, I did believe that if and when Lucas decided to give it another go, that he should change his mind about Episodes I - III, and perhaps give us Episodes VII - IX, with a new story line and new characters.  The problem with prequels is and always has been, that no matter how you tell the story, you know how it will turn out in the end.  It is this fact that usually makes prequels box office poison.  I did know that if any writer, director, producer, could pull it off successfully it would be George Lucas.  Did he succeed?  In Episode One it appears that he did.As in all the Star Wars movies, we are quickly thrust into the storyline. There is not much time to linger on character development in the opening, as Lucas has always strided to grab the audience's attention as soon as the famous Star Wars scroll rolls off the screen.  We are immediately introduced to a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn, played by Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson respectively, who are on the planet Naboo where the evil Trade Federation is plotting a takeover.  From the outset, both characters, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, fit their parts well, and have good chemistry together. Later we meet Queen Amidala, ruler of Naboo, intriquingly played by Natalie Portman, who is to be one of the central characters through out the first three episodes. With Amidala pretending to be one of her servants, and Jar Jar Binks whom they also met on Naboo, along with old friend R2D2 they end up on Tatooine, where we meet a very young Anakin Skywalker, played well by Jake Lloyd who is living as a slave with his mother Shmi, wonderfully underplayed by Pernilla August. (I suppose just because your civilization is advanced technically, doesn't mean you you're advanced culturally).  It is here, in the now famous pod race, that this film technically shines.  It is undoubtedly one of the most visually entertaining and brilliant race sequences put on film.  There are other great moments of technical brilliance such as the underwater city of Naboo and the battle for Naboo. We also meet many other important characters, such as Senator Palpatine, played by Ian McDiarmind, Ray Parker menacingly effective as Darth Maul, and Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Widu in a small part that promises to expand as the saga continues.  We are also reintroduced to Yoda and briefly to C3PO, even a brief appearance by Jabba the Hut. They  are here to give a continuing link to all the episodes.So in the end, how does this all stack up.  In total it does quite well. There are enough hints at surprises, things we may not have known before, that will keep the saga interesting and entertaining despite knowing it's final outcome.  Liam Neeson was excellent, and I really liked his relationship with the young Obi-Wan.  The young Anakin Skywalker is very sympathetic, so much so that it is hard to see him as the future Darth Vader.  His mother, Shmi, is portrayed tragically, not only living as a slave, but having to send her son off to become a Jedi, perhaps to never see him again.  Natalie Portman brings the right mix of understanding, yet firmness to her role as Queen Amidala, being defiant when she has to be, giving us just a glimpse of what Princess Leia perhaps inherited.  Whether this is intentional or unintentional, it works.  As for poor Jar Jar, who took such a beating in the press, really folks, he isn't that bad!As for the story itself, George Lucas gives us a lot of promises here, and we can only hope they are promises kept.  He has taken a good step one at giving us a new, exciting, interesting trilogy.Next Class please.",8,8,17,12 July 2003
50 First Dates," A little less of the usual Sandler shtick would have helped
","Let's make one thing perfectly clear. I am not an Adam Sandler fan. If it is within my power to avoid seeing Adam Sandler on the big screen, small screen, or on the cover of People Magazine, then I do so at all costs. The problem is that I have this girlfriend. She loves to watch Adam Sandler movies. Then again, my girlfriend will watch just about any film slapped onto a DVD and put into a case. She truly believes that if it says on the cover 'hilarious and uproarious' it must be so because they wouldn't print false advertisement since the manufacturer could be sued. Okay, so I'm exaggerating a bit but only a little bit. Anyway, the first Adam Sandler film I saw was The Waterboy, a film many found to be 'hilarious and uproarious' I found it to be 'stupid and idiotic cinematic crapola.' From that point in time, I vowed to cleanse my soul by making it my life's mission to never occupy the same room if there was even a whiff of Adam Sandler strutting across the TV screen. Until last night, except for one bout with Mr. Deeds, I had pretty much succeeded in that regard, but then my world caved in again. Having been to the theater three times this week without her (she was working so don't blast me), the aforementioned girlfriend insisted I sit and watch a film of her choosing. Her choosing was 50 First Dates, a film she had borrowed from a co-worker. Catastrophe! And worst yet, co-starring Rob Schneider! Yech! Well maybe I could fall asleep and she wouldn't notice. Then again, Drew Barrymore was also in it and I loved her in E.T. and loved her in Firestarter when she was doing that really cool fire trick with her brain so maybe I wouldn't suffer too much. True to form, the early part of 50 First Dates is typical Adam Sandler/Rob Schneider shtick. Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a Hawaii Veterinarian who talks to his animals like Dr. Doolittle, and is heavy into one night stands with female tourists. To avoid having them become attached and want to stay in Hawaii with him he tells them stuff like he's a secret agent getting ready to go on a mission. So supposedly every female tourist that vacations in Hawaii is a dumb bimbo which they would have to be to fall for such nonsense. It wasn't funny and I was suffering already. Henry's best friend and hanger on, Ula (Rob Schneider) comes to see Henry whenever he needs stitched up after having had a shark take a bite out of him. He also comes to see Henry hoping that Henry will relate every detail of his one night stands to him, because Ula's wife just doesn't do it for him anymore. Ula also brings along his brood of kids. As it turns out, the kids are cute, Ula is surprisingly funny, so are the kids, and my pain eases a bit.Then there's Henry's assistant Alexa (Lusia Strus). She looks like Cloris Leachman had just made a wrong turn from the set of Young Frankenstein and ended up in the wrong movie. Her jokes are bad, we've seen the ugly assistant bit before and done much better, and then a Walrus pukes on her and I'm back wallowing in my misery once again. Soon Henry is having breakfast in a diner that specializes in spam and eggs so that later on we can have a few spam jokes thrown our way. It is then that he spots Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) making a house out of her waffles. He puts the moves on her, they have a nice conversation, Henry is attracted to her as a person and not as a bimbo, there's a funny guy sitting at the counter, the people that run the restaurant are kind of funny, and it looks like things are back on track. It's only a temporary reprieve though because when Henry goes back to the diner to meet her the next morning he finds out that she wakes up every day not remembering what happened the day before. This time when he tries to make hay with her, he fails and once again the film goes astray as we get scene after scene after scene of Henry meeting Lucy in the diner or down the road trying to get her to notice him so that they can have another first date. The sequences are totally done for slapstick, not remotely funny, and although we can sympathize with Henry's motives the low brow comedy just doesn't fit in with what he is trying to achieve or what the story is really about. Eventually Henry meets Lucy's father Marlin (Blake Clark) and her brother Doug (Sean Astin). There is a funny yet touching sequence where we see Lucy coming home and Marlin and Doug have to relive the same day over and over again because if Lucy finds out she loses her memory everyday, she becomes traumatized.As you can tell the film is all over the place. There are times when it's a very well done sweet romantic comedy, with a lot of heart. At other times, it seems to want to sink back into the usual ineptness of low-brow films like The Waterboy. Eventually, in the latter part of Fifty First Dates, the comedy low-jinks do subside for the most part and the film seems to get on track. A lot of this can be attributed to Drew Barrymore who gives a very sensitive portrayal of a woman trapped by circumstances beyond her control. Whenever she is on the screen, the film lifts itself up about ten notches. Despite my earlier comments, I have always felt Barrymore was often underrated in the acting department. Her problem is she picks some lousy scripts with which to display that talent. Sandler however eventually tones down his shtick quite a bit, leaving the lowbrow comedy up to Schneider which is where it should have stayed in the first place because most of his lines are the funniest in the film. Likewise, Astin and the rest of the supporting cast are good also, but there's a running joke about body building concerning Doug that continues on way too long and wasn't really necessary at all.This is the kind of film I find infuriating. There's a wonderfully romantic story, so why did writer George Wing not take that and run with it? Why sink to the idiotic antics that are so unnecessary especially when we've seen that kind of thing from Sandler so many times? When halfway through the film Sandler begins to show how much he does care for Lucy and the steps he takes to help her overcome her desperate plight, it's a side of Sandler we seldom see. He still can't act, as evidenced by his stupidly awful crying scene (at one point he does a fake crying bit, later he cries for real and both are the same), but Lucy and Henry's romance was good enough that we could easily have overlooked his failings. There was much about 50 First Dates that I enjoyed. There was a large amount of it that I didn't. In the end, I'd have to say that the last half of the film is so good that it's just enough for me to give it a recommendation. Those who love the usual Sandler films will enjoy the first half, and those like me who don't will fall for the second half of the film.And most of all it has a very nicely well done ending, that kind of touched me and when a film does that I have no choice but to give it my grade. I should probably just give it a C and leave it at that, but since it's an Adam Sandler film I have to grade on the curve and give it a B- but only because the romantic story was so well done, and I'm just a romantic kind of guy. Can't you tell?",7,0,0,27 July 2004
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'Spielberg's Heart and Soul'
","In an age when many movie goers sit in a theater judging how real the computer generated special effects are or how detailed the computer animation is, I wonder if a movie with the heart and soul of E.T. could even find an audience.  It's disheartening when people write that movies like Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc.,  are way better than this classic Stephen Spielberg film.  I enjoyed Toy Story and Shrek both, but they don't come close to the emotional impact of E.T.E.T. is not just a story about an alien who gets lost on earth.  It's a story about family, friendship, love and loneliness, and it is these elements that we always remember. Spielberg, drawing on his own childhood experiences, captivates us with an unforgettable and timeless story.  E. T. could be every lonely child's invisible friend.  We never think of E.T. as an alien special effect, but as Elliot's own invisible friend come to life. We see the pain of a family going through divorce without being hammered over the head with it in every scene, a masterful achievement in itself.  Of all of Spielberg's great films, I can't think any can match what he achieved in E.T, scene for scene.  Melissa Mathison's script is perfect, the casting was as if Spielberg rubbed a magic lamp, asked for the perfect cast, and got it.  John Williams score is so beautifully done, it is worth listening to just by itself.There is not a wasted moment in this film, every scene is exceptional and memorable.  I saw this movie on it's original release in 1982.  At the end of the movie, the audience stood and applauded, something I have not seen again in twenty years.",10,2,4,13 April 2003
Underworld," Dracula vs. the Wolf Man by committee
","In the opening moments of this film we get a voice over narration by Selene played by Kate Beckinsale.  It's a nice looking well photographed scene, and it grabs are attention.  Unfortunately, in this opening monologue, we also get a lot of vague mumble jumbo attempting to explain who Selene is, what she's doing and why.  By the time the narration is finished we don't have anymore of a clue as to what's going on then we did as we entered the theater.  And that as just about how it goes for the entire length of Underworld.Don't fret though, eventually you'll discover through a certain amount of diligence that this is the story about the Vampires and the Lycans, or werewolves if you will.  Think Dracula vs. the Wolf Man by committee and you pretty much have the picture.  We also know that the Vampires have spent years trying to do in the Lycans and have been quite successful at it.  It seems that Selene discovers the Lycans are after a certain human named Michael Corvin(Scott Speedman).  They need to mix his blood with theirs for reasons that are never quite clear.  It also turns out that after tracking down Michael on her own, Selene finds herself attracted to him.  We know this only because of the way the plot develops, not because of any kind of emotional response offered by Selene.  Of course she is a vampire and chances are she isn't supposed to have any romantic notions, but if she doesn't have any emotions....well, I don't want to convolute an already polluted film any more than it is.There's also a lot of other stories told to us during Underworld.  There are more monologues in this film explaining background and motives than any film in recent memory.  My best advice to you is if you watch this film, be prepared to draw a chart as these many explanations are rattled off because you'll sure need one.  There's a story about why and how Selene became a vampire, there's a story about why Michael is being hunted by the Lycans, there's a story about why two vampire leaders sleep for years and only one is awakened at a time, there's a story about why bullets are taken out of the Lycans and put back in.  After a while I felt like I should go to the book store and buy the Cliff Notes.  There are so many stories and so many explanations, and most of them are so convoluted and long winded that it's impossible to follow this film without being overcome by long periods of boredom.A lot of what is on the screen looks good.  The battle scenes between the Lycans and the Vampires are all well done and interesting to look at.  The sets are adequately foreboding and photographed in the kind of prevalent bluish haze that seems to have overtaken the film world in the last few years.  We do look at the battle and attack scenes in a passive kind of way because Underworld has complicated it's plot and background to an extent that we really don't care about who the good guys are or the bad guys are or whatever.  We are never given a chance to be drawn into this story and none of the performances here help.  I don't care if this is a film about the supernatural, there is not one performance in this film that is more than one note.  Beckinsale certainly looks OK in her leather outfit, and she performs the action scenes well enough, but does nothing at any point to make us care about her or help draw us into her story.  Speedman's human character of Michael is no better.  We don't feel any sympathy, fear, or anything about him because after two hours you won't know him as a person any better than you did when he makes his first appearance. 
If you take the time to watch Underworld, you might appreciate the action scenes, the dark settings, and several scenes of modern day werewolves and vampires battling it out.  As for myself I've only got one thing to ask, 'Where's my copy of Dracula vs. The Wolf Man?'My Grade: C-",6,0,0,19 February 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A movie about Pirates that is based on a ride just won't work. Wanna Bet?
","Since May, it has seemed as if 2003 was going to be just a run of the mill summer full of so-so sequels, average action movies, and very little of anything to look back on.  In total, it may still turn out that way, but thanks to Finding Nemo from Disney/Pixar and now Pirates of the Caribbean from Disney, there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel.  They not only broke the mold by giving us a Pirate movie of all things, they gave us a Pirate Movie that is exciting, humorous, adventurous, suspense filled, and filled with excellent performances all the way around.  It is one heck of a good time at the movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean is everything that Cutthroat Island wish it could have been, but didn't even come close to realizing.  Renny Harlin and Geena Davis, eat your hearts out.Make no mistake about it.  From the moment he steps onto the dock as Jack Sparrow, this is Johnny Depp's film.  Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow, a pirate who wants to regain his ship from the evil Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush).  In order to do so, he is forced to join forces with Will Turner (played by Orlando Bloom)to rescue the girl Will is sweet on, Elizabeth Swann (played by Keira Knightly).  Depp's characterization of Sparrow is so memorable, that even when he isn't on the screen you are thinking about him.   All the actors are excellent in their roles, with high marks all the way around.  Keira Knightly shows more then just a feminine side in Elizabeth Swann, Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa is just evil enough to make a good villain, yet not so menacing as to bog the picture down. Orlando Bloom has the thankless role of playing the mostly straight arrow good guy, but he does it well, playing the part as it should be while knowing full well that doing so makes this Depp's film.  That is not an easy thing to do in any film.The battle sequences and sword fights are staged to perfection by Gore Verbinski.  They are never confusing, even when there is a screen full of pirates having a bit of swordplay.  Though the movie is a bit long, you never think about it as Verbinski keeps his film paced just right, while at the same time letting you get to know all you need to know about his characters.A movie based on a Disneyland ride could just never work, and a Pirate Movie at that.  That's what I and many others thought before seeing Pirates of the Caribbean. I hereby, eat one heck of a lot of hay, and am very happy to do so.Next Class Please",9,0,1,13 July 2003
Beauty and the Beast," 'The Perfect Animated Movie'
","In the opening of Beauty and The Beast, we find out more about the characters in the first five minutes, then many movies tell us in half an hour.  Taking a risk, and opening an animated film with a long musical number was a risky move, but as it turns out, a perfectly wonderful idea. From the opening to the end, we are totally captivated by this wonderful achievement in music and animation as we have never been before.Unlike many animated Disney movies where a song may be thrown in here and there, and do little to move the story along, each song here is directly related to the story line, moves the movie along, and leaves us anticipating the next big number.  Alan Menken and Howard Ashman deserve every bit of the praise they received for this film, and then some.All the characters in this film are so well animated and voiced, you never once think about the fact that you are watching an animated movie, as is often the case.  From the town that Belle lives in, to the Beast castle, the backgrounds are beautifully rendered in detail, and vibrant alive colors. In 1991, this was a ground breaking, animated film, and over ten years later, as much as I enjoy many of the new computer animated movies such as Shrek and Toy Story, none has come close to the accomplishments of Beauty and the Beast, which mixes romance, music, comedy and drama, in a perfect blend that may never be seen again.",10,7,8,13 April 2003
Spider-Man 2," It's not about the special effects, it's about the story, the characters, and the human drama
","Two years, ago Sam Raimi brought Spiderman to the screen in spectacular fashion. Of all the come book super heroes romping around on the big screen since then, some have managed to be good, a few have struggled to be just okay, and some have reeked of super doo doo. Absolutely none of these wannabes such as The Hulk, Hellboy, or Daredevil, have come close to matching the success of Raimi's Spiderman. For all their razzle dazzle CGI special effects, none of the writers and directors of those films seemed to be able to grasp the fact that when all is said and done, it's still the story, the characters, and the human drama that counts. Peter Parker could be the guy next door, your best friend down the street, your cousin, your nephew or even me. He is just an ordinary guy, who has been blessed with powers that he didn't ask for, and much of the time would just as soon not be burdened with the responsibilities and anguish that comes as part of the deal. So after almost two years and two full months since we last saw Spiderman, the question remains as to whether or not Raimi can recapture the magic. The answer is that he not only recaptures it, he harvests it, weaves it, and packages it in a film that surpasses the original in every way imaginable. This film surpasses the first one in so many aspects that I almost feel compelled to go back and lower the A grade I bestowed upon that one. That was then, however, and this is now, and this is as good as it gets. From the time the opening credits hit the screen you know there's something special in store. Raimi does a recap by using comic book paintings to recapture important details of the original film. I can't remember any film where I wanted it to start over again just so I could soak in the opening sequence. The artwork is done by an artist named Alex Ross, and this is the first time I felt it necessary to give acclaim to someone about film credits, but he deserves it.As for Peter Parker things aren't going too well. He still carries a torch for Mary Jane who has a new boyfriend, his best friend Harry Osborn is obsessed with avenging his father's death, his late night hours fighting crime as Spiderman are causing him to flunk his college courses, he's always late for work delivering pizzas, and his mother is in such bad financial straits that the bank may foreclose on her home. It's enough to make a guy want to give up the ghost, or failing that his Spiderman costume. Worst of all, as his personal life begins to weigh heavily on Peter Parker, his Spiderman powers seem to be diminishing, sometimes failing him altogether at the worst possible moment.In order to keep from failing one of his classes, Peter is doing a paper on Dr. Otto Octavious whom is experimenting with fusion as a viable energy source. Eventually Harry, who is financing the Dr.'s experiments, takes Peter to meet him and shortly thereafter with scientists and the press in attendance, Dr. Octavius begins his experiment. In order to handle the material needed to carry out the experiment, Dr. Octavious has huge tentacles connected to his body. When the experiment goes awry, the tentacles permanently fuse to his body and develop a will of their own, while controlling his mind and turning him into Doc Ock. Just as in the first Spiderman, we have another villain that is in some ways a lot like Peter Parker. Like Spiderman, Norman Osborne was changed into the Green Goblin, not because he wanted to be but because of an overzealousness in perfecting scientific experiments. Norman may not have been the best person on Earth, but he was far from being evil. The same can be said of Dr. Octavius. He is a good scientist working to better things for mankind, but just as Norman Osborne found out, you better make sure you know exactly what you're doing. Both of these are perfect examples of what makes a good villain. In a way, we can almost sympathize with their misfortune much in the same we sympathize with the dilemma of everyday life wearing on Peter Parker. Why other films such as Hellboy find it necessary to give us villains who come from incomprehensible mumble jumbo hooey phooey is something I'll never understand. Spiderman doesn't require us to take a notepad and pencil along with us so we can map a convoluted plot that we have to spend so much time figuring out that by the time we do we've lost interest in the film the characters and everything else.There was a time when Tobey Maguire was almost replaced by Jake Gyllenhaal for the sequel. I don't know how Gyllenhaal would have done and frankly, I'm glad we didn't have the chance to find out. Maguire is able to portray the burdens he faces as Peter Parker without falling into the trap of overplaying the role with so much angst that we lose our identity with him. As he worships Mary Jane from afar, we feel the love, we feel the pain, but not too much that the film becomes weighed down by it. To not have Toby as Spiderman, they should just as well put George Clooney in the role. Both James Franco as Harry and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane manage to bring even more depth to their characters. Harry is still tortured by the fact that he never seemed able to live up to his father's expectations. The experiments of Dr. Octavius are crucial for him to be able to lift that burden because if successful, he will have surpassed anything his father had accomplished. When the experiment fails, the only driving force left in his soul is his desire for revenge against Spiderman whom he mistakenly holds responsible for his father's death. Mary Jane has become a model and an actress. She is now independent and self-assured, and despite the fact that she may love Peter, she is determined to move on with her life. Let's not forget Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. Unlike the first film, she is given much more to do here. She has some great scenes, some funny moments, and some very touching ones. Whereas the first film explored in depth the relationship between Peter and his Uncle Ben, we get more in depth story between Peter and his Aunt here. She is not in this film just to bake cakes and pat Peter on the head.As for the special effects, what can I say except that in every way they surpass anything you've seen before. The arms of Dr. Octavius wave around as if they have a mind of their own. When Spiderman goes to battle with him, it makes the confrontations between Spidey and The Green Goblin pale by comparison. There is an amazing battle in a bank, and an even more fantastic one aboard an Elevated train. Not to mention that we find out what it's like to be Spiderman and try to deliver pizzas as a superhero. Some found the special effects in the first film flawed. I was not one of them but just the same, they are done with such precision and expertise here, flowing seamlessly between CGI and live action. You won't know the difference.You'll also be happy to know that Raimi does an excellent job in wrapping up this episode, yet is able to already begin setting up Spiderman 3 in the process. It's a perfect example how to just wet your appetite for the next one, yet leave you completely satisfied with the conclusion at hand.For all the special effects, all the battles, and all the scenes of Spiderman flying around the Manhattan skyscrapers, without the human elements the film would be just another special effects extravaganza we would forget about as soon we walk out of the theater. Raimi understands this better than anybody else. So does Maguire and the rest of the cast. It's the burdens, the conflicts, and the passion that Spiderman carries inside himself that lift him so far above any of the other Super heroes. That's what has made these films truly something special. It has been years since I felt compelled to pay money to see a film twice in a theater. The last time I did was probably for one of the original Star Wars films. I think I'll be seeing Spiderman in a theater for a second time, and that's the highest recommendation I can think of. And if I'm going to the theater for a second time you can damn well bet I have no choice but to give Spiderman 2 an unqualified, resounding, A+.",10,0,0,26 July 2004
Troy," Silly script proves to be Troy's Achilles Heel
","There was one particular school year some time ago, that I distinctly remember that I was supposed to study Homer's Iliad. I may or may not have read through no more than a couple of paragraphs before putting it down probably to watch some Television show which held infinitely more interest for me than a story on why the Greeks and Trojans were at each other's throats over a thousand years ago. As I write this review, I can almost hear Dan Ackroyd telling me as he did Bill Murry in Ghostbuster's that I never studied. Shameful as it is, I didn't. If I had I doubted it would have added or taken away from how I view Wolfgang Petersen's and Warner Brother's $185 million dollar extravaganza.What I do know about the story, I probably remember from watching Jeopardy one too many times, and what I have now learned from Director Petersen and Writer David Benioff. There's this chick Helen (Diane Kruger), who is supposed to be the Queen of Sparta. While visiting Sparta to talk peace, a young Trojan Prince named Paris (Orlando Bloom)let's his libido get the better of him and decides to get it on with the Queen. Deciding that Helen would be better off being a fixture in his bedroom than that of her husband Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), Paris decides to give Helen a one way Love Boat trip back to Troy and although Paris's brother Hector (Eric Bana) sees the folly in stealing another man's wife, he goes along with his brother because well, he's his brother. This doesn't sit too kindly with Menelaus, so he makes an alliance with King Agamemnon (Brian Cox)to go to battle with Troy so he can reclaim his beloved with the sole purpose of removing Helen's head from the rest of her body parts. Then there's Achilles (Brad Pitt) who is supposed to be the greatest warrior around, sort of a Superman in armor carrying a sword. Trouble is, Achilles likes killing, but not for Agamemnon. He decides eventually to go along anyway because he has this vision that one day he will be remembered for the great warrior he was so that people like Petersen will make a multi-million dollar epic and people like me and other IMDB critics with visions of grandeur will be sitting here writing a review that nobody will read.For those of who have studied The Iliad, I'm sure that my simplistic synopsis of the story will offend them, but this is the story Petersen gives us. He spends little time explaining the intricacies of why Hector and Paris are talking peace with Sparta, but gives us a silly scene in Helen's bedroom between her and Paris before whisking us away to Troy. We have no clue as to how the relationship developed, and Helen comes off as nothing more than being a pin-up girl for the city of Troy and Paris's infatuation with her plays like a high school freshman's crush on the Senior prom queen.Of course, when you're in a hurry to get to the blood and guts glory of the historic battles, punctuated by numerous sweeping CGI shots of thousands of Greek ships and soldiers lining the gates of Troy, one can almost forgive the early part of the film since it's the battle scenes that will be counted on to put fannies into the theater seats. It may have helped if Bloom's Paris had the least bit of personality or passion, but it seems his goody two shoes pirate act last summer was no act at all. This may be the best he has to offer and one can only hope for better things. Bana's Hector is much better and far more interesting. One can sense the loyalty he feels toward his country, his father King Priam (Peter O'Toole), and even his insipid little brother. Brad Pitt's Achilles is almost as bad as Bloom's Paris. For a great warrior, Pitt plays him as nothing more than a gladiator with deep psychological torments. I almost expected Benioff to write a scene in here for Tony Soprano's psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi. And there lies most of the problem with Troy, especially during the first half of the film. Much of it plays like the dialog was written from an old Cecil B. DeMille crib sheet stolen from his biblical epics. I don't think I've heard dialog this silly since Ross Hunter gave us Lana Turner in Madame X. At least twice I almost chuckled out loud, but had to stifle it as the rest of the audience I viewed the film with seemed to be highly engrossed in what was going on. Fortunately, once the battles do begin, they elevate the film to a certain degree. I would go so far as to call the last hour engrossing-well almost.The battle scenes are terrific when they are focusing on the close ups of man to man sword play. The long sweeping CGI scenes of huge fleets of ships and thousands of warriors aren't nearly as impressive. There are way too many of these special effects showboating scenes, and if you look toward the back of the shots, the effects are quite obvious. Even the battle scenes are not beyond being marred by one or two goofy moments. During one scene in particular after Hector has dispatched a certain soldier he has fought with and everyone is standing around as if it was Rocky vs. Apollo Creed, instead of the soldiers continuing the battle Hector says something to the effect, 'That's enough fighting for today, see you in the morning.' If only modern warfare was so diplomatic.There are two actors who shine above all others in the film. Peter O'Toole has a couple of great scenes, and in one so overshadows Brad Pitt that it only punctuates Pitt's limited abilities. The other is an actress named Rose Byrne as temple virgin Briseis. She is remarkable, and brings much needed spark to the movie in every scene she plays and since many of those scenes are with Pitt's tormented Achilles, one can see how welcome that might be. She could certainly have taught Helen a thing or two. If you manage to make it through the first half of Troy, you'll probably get at least some of your money's worth in the second half even as flawed as it is. And if it takes the second half of a film for me to get anything close to my money's worth I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Troy is a C-. And Dan, next time I will study.",5,2,3,16 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Excellent film about wanting to love and be loved in a world unwilling to accept it
","One does not head out to see Brokeback Mountain without having a general idea of what the film is about. Unless you've had your head buried in a cocoon, you know that Brokeback Mountain is the Gay Cowboy Movie which has received one award after another as the best picture of 2005. Are the accolades more the result of its controversial subject matter or is it really that good? I can say unequivocally that Brokeback Mountain is much more than just a gay cowboy love story. Yes, it is a love story, but it is also about the heartache, the heartbreak, the guilt and the shame forced upon those who through no fault of their own, love and cherish someone of their own gender and are unable to acknowledge that love openly and honestly because of the rigid codes forced upon them by society. It is in every aspect an excellent film.A ranch hand, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) meets rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) while working as sheep herders in the mountains of Wyoming during the summer of 1963. During their time together they fall in love and have sex. Yet, it is a love that is never acknowledged between them as being such. It is as Ennis puts it, 'one-shot deal going on.' 'You know I ain't queer,' he tells Jack just to make sure he understands.Jack's reply, 'Neither am I.' One need look no further then when Ennis relates how his father took him to view the corpse of a gay man who was tortured and then beaten to death, to understand the consequences of not only being gay in 1963 but being discovered. It's a story that casts a dark shadow over the rest of the film. Both men do what they can to fit in. They marry and have children. With Ennis, it is a way to prove that his summer on Brokeback was just a one shot deal, with Jack it is a marriage of convenience.It is under this ominous cloud that these men must find a way to share their love, in whatever way possible and still try to fit into what society views as being normal. Jack knows he is gay without admitting it. We experience their joy when they are together. We feel their loneliness when they are apart. When four years have passed since their summer on the mountain, Ennis anxiously awaits a first visit by Jack. He chain smokes and chugs on beer trying to stay calm, unable to hide his feelings. It is also the first time that his wife, Alma (Michelle Williams), begins to realize there is more to the relationship than meets the eye.Ang Lee's direction of this film is beyond reproach. It would have been tempting for some directors to exploit the subject matter and hammer us over the head with it. Lee keeps the focus on a very personal level, never letting the story stray or go off on a tangent. The cast is as superb as the direction. I have seen Heath Ledger in several films, most of them instantly forgettable so I was totally unprepared and shocked by the depth of emotion he brings to Ennis here. And he does it not by being over the top, but with a great deal of subtlety and nuance. Ennis is a man of few words, but Ledger tells us everything we need to know about him without a tremendous amount of dialog.Gyllenhaal is every bit as good as Jack Twist. Jack Twist is a man of many words, but he is also a man who never gives up on his dream of someday living the life he wants to, and sharing it with the person he loves the most.In supporting roles, both Michelle Williams as Alma and Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife Lureen are excellent also. We suspect that Lureen's marriage to Jack is as much a marriage of convenience for her as it is for him. She doesn't have much screen time, but she makes the most of it. If her roles in the straight to DVD film Havoc and Brokeback are any indication, her days of being thought of as the Princess in the Princess Diaries films will soon be forgotten. Regrettably, I had not seen any of Michelle Williams work before Brokeback but I wish I had. She is very deserving of her Academy Award nomination for her work here.Of course, there will always be those who say that much of the recognition Brokeback is receiving has more to do with its subject matter than with the quality of the film itself. Nothing could be more wrong. Yes, the subject matter may be controversial to some, but the truth is there is there is no reason why it should be. Although things have changed quite a bit since 1963 there are still way too many who fear gays as if they were the devil, the bogeyman, and should all carry the last name of Nasty as Alma calls Jack at one point. In the week before I saw Brokeback Mountain, a man walked into a gay bar in Massachusetts and began assaulting the patrons with a hatchet and a gun. In Roanoke Virginia five years ago, Ronald Edward Gay walked into the Backstreet Café and began shooting, simply because he wanted to kill homosexuals. If the day ever comes, and whether or not it is in my lifetime, that a person can love someone of their own gender and walk through a mall, a parking lot, or an amusement park hand in hand without receiving so much as a glance, then Brokeback Mountain may no longer be controversial. But it'll still be a great film, and when you're a great film you know I have no choice but to give you an overwhelming A+.",10,35,43,9 February 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Tune into the Weather Channel for this years end of the world scenario
","Back in the 70's, Hollywood producers and directors were overcome by a highly contagious disease known as disaster-itis. Filmmakers seemed to take great delight in blowing up one airplane after another, burning 120 story buildings to the ground, leveling Los Angeles with earthquakes, turning ships upside down, and even going so far as to have the whole state of Texas attacked by Killer Bees. Irwin Allan was the biggest carrier of disaster-itis and unfortunately for him, the longer the disease went unchecked, the more his films sank into an abyss of mediocrity. (See: Allen's The Swarm, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure & When Time Ran Out). Disaster-itis has never truly left Hollywood. It just lays dormant from year to year, returning sometimes annually, sometimes semi-annually to goad some big name director into giving us another CGI laden special effects extravaganza wreaking havoc on either the good old U.S.A. or the world as we know it. Director and Writer Roland Emmerich is a known carrier of the disaster-itis germ. In 1996 he suffered an outbreak and brought us Aliens doing in Mother Earth in Independence Day. Two scant years later disaster-itis reared it's ugly head again, this time mutating into a Japanese strain of the virus causing Emmerich to bring Godzilla over from Japan. To relieve the symptoms, Roland had Godzilla stomp and chomp his way through New York. Apparently it was enough to send the germ into remission for six long years until Emmerich again was overwhelmed by the disaster-itis germ as if it were a form of incurable herpes.The culprit Emmerich selected to help rid himself of the disease this time around is global warming. It seems we are nothing but a bunch of careless polluters riding around in our SUV's sending emissions out into the ozone layer. This in turn has caused the polar ice caps to slowly melt away into the oceans. Funny thing about fresh water and salt water is that they don't mix too well. This is not a good thing to happen and is clearly stated so several times by Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), to Vice President Becker (Kenneth Welsh) and anyone else who happens to be within ear shot. Hall says that despite the Arctic meltdown, we have at the minimum a hundred good years left, maybe even a few thousand by which time you and I will be pushing up daisies and be none the wiser. Trouble occurs however because although Hall is a good scientist, he's not a very good fortune teller and underestimates this impending disaster by about a hundred to a thousand years. This means that from coast to coast, from the United States, to Great Britain, and on to Russia, all hell is going to break loose at any moment and in The Day After Tomorrow hell hath no fury like an environment scorned.Unless you truly have been living up in the Arctic, you know all this already what with the bombardment of television ads, newspaper ads, web site ads and everything else Fox and Emmerich have used to promote this film for the past six years.well it hasn't been that long it just seems like it. If the film turns out to be spectacular all that advertising doesn't matter. If the film comes in as being average or less than okay, just as Emmerich found out with Godzilla, hype will get the fannies into the seats that first weekend, but word of mouth can make your film an even bigger disaster than anything you put on the screen. Does The Day After Tomorrow live up to the hype? We go to the expert from another over hyped Emmerich film for our answer.'Mr. Godzilla, does The Day After Tomorrow live up to the hype?' Godzilla grins and says, 'Nope.'The special effects that you have seen in the trailers, in television ads and in the ten minute sneak preview Fox ran before American Idols one evening are spectacular on the big screen with digital surround sound included to blow out your ear drums. There's something awe inspiring about seeing a bunch of twisters circulating around Los Angeles taking out the Hollywood sign, wiping out skyscrapers, crashing helicopters and making a huge mess. In Japan we have huge chunks of ice falling to the ground. In the skies we have super sized thunderstorms giving airline passengers one heck of a bumpy ride. Hurricanes run rampant, and Great Britain gets a very early White Christmas. To top it all off, New York is flooded by a gigantic tidal wave, which then freezes over causing snow to bury much of what's left of the skyline. It's all amazing stuff, but unfortunately there's not enough of it and everything else about the film is as bland as day old toast.As silly as some of the 70's disaster flicks were they could always be counted on for some entertaining characters occupying the film no matter how cheesy and inept the dialog may become. It didn't matter how inept (Airport 1975) or how good (Towering Inferno, Poseidon Adventure) those films were, they managed to overcome their weaknesses by making us care about the predicament of those involved. As predictable as they were, you could always count on a few moments of hair raising adventure or suspense. In The Day After Tomorrow, we never care about anything that happens to the characters and when the rampaging weather isn't on the screen the film falls into long stretches of tedious boredom.With disaster all around them, it's incredible how blasé everyone in this film seems to be. It's just not the Dick Cheney vice presidential look alike, but Quaid's Jack Hall seems to be taking everything in stride also. When he goes off to rescue his son who is in danger of becoming a human Popsicle in New York City, we sit and wait for excitement and some kind of suspense that never develops. Only twice in the whole trip does Hall face any kind of eminent danger and these situations are dispatched with quickly and predictably. Likewise, Hall's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his companions in New York, never strike us as being in any real danger. Although they have one scene where they are being chased by some escaped timber wolves, the rest of their scenes include a lot of talking, some preaching, and a lot of book burning. After all, they have a whole library at their disposal to keep warm with so why not torch a few copies of Harold Robbins and Jacqueline Susann? Unfortunately, burning books adds up to zero in the way of suspense unless your film is title Fahrenheit 451.Then there's Hall's ex-wife Lucy (Sela Ward) left behind to care for a cancer ridden young boy. We admire her for it, but once again there is no build up of suspense as Emmerich leaves little doubt as to what the outcome of that story or anything else will be. Even when President Blake (Perry King) waits until the last minute to depart the White House, we only hear of his fate, we don't witness it. Wasn't it much more interesting to see the President and The First Lady in Independence Day facing imminent danger? Also, when will the studios learn that when they show all the aces in your hand with trailers and ads before people even get to the theater, those first weekend patrons will be sure to let everyone know 'you saw all the good stuff in the previews.'So why whitewash everything? The problem with Emmerich and the studios that make a film like The Day After Tomorrow is they are so intent on assuring themselves of nothing worse than their precious PG-13 rating, that for all the disasters taking place, we see little of the actual human toll involved. If all you want to show us are buildings and cities being taken down when millions have lost their lives, do you really expect us to become emotionally involved with your story? As for the PG-13 rating, the studio must have begged for it as there's no reason this film shouldn't be any worse than a PG. It is never frightening, never suspenseful and most of the time a bore with a capital B.If Emmerich was trying to make a serious film about global warming, then perhaps they should have done away with all the special effects hype and sold the film on a more serious level. It's possible that's what he really had in mind but you can't sell a film on that basis when you're trying to put more fannies in the theater than that green ogre known as Shrek. The problem is, I have to view the film the way it was sold to me. It was sold as a special effects laden disaster film which just happens to use global warming as it's plot device. And when you make a disaster film that does nothing to sustain the goodwill accumulated by some great special effects, has no interesting characters, and zero suspense, I have no choice but to give you my grade which for The Day After Tomorrow is a C-.Oh yes, one more important thing before I go. Take it from an old Midwestern boy. Someone should tell those L.A. news stations that if for some odd reason a tornado does come floating down Hollywood Boulevard, it's really not a good idea to be playing tag with them while riding in a helicopter.",4,0,1,20 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas fails to deliver on the promises of Phantom Menace
","In my review of The Phantom Menace, which was quite favorable, I stated that making any kind of a prequel is a daunting task, as your audience generally knows where you are headed.  In order to do so and be successful you had better introduce some interesting, well rounded, well acted characters, and enough plot twists and surprises to keep the audience riveted and wanting to come back to find out what happens next.  While I thought George Lucas was off to a fairly good start in The Phantom Menace, in Attack of the Clones, he seems to have lost his way.  He now seems so intent to dazzle us with technology that he has forgotten some of the important things that audiences care about, such as a good script, good acting,  character development, and having the audience actually care about what happens to those characters he puts in the middle of all those dazzling special effects.  I can only guess that he has become so enamored of the technical side of film making, that nothing else seems to matter.  If you want to tell your story, tell your story, but don't shortchange your audience in the process.In the first film, we had a good rapport between Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon Jin, not unlike the relationship one would see in any good buddy movie.  In Clones, we have the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin, who may be ten years older, but not ten years wiser by any stretch of the imagination. Most of their time together on the screen is spent with Obi-Wan chastising Anakin about this and that, and then Anakin whining and complaining about it like some sniveling little brat.  Jake Lloyd gave us more maturity in Phantom then Hayden Christiansen does here.  We are given no clue as to how Anakin developed his propensity for being such an annoying twit, since Lucas finds it necessary to completely skip over everything that happened in the ten years since the last episode. Whereas Ewan McGregor was so good in Phantom, he is good here also, but only when he is out of the company of Anakin.  On his own, he is fun to watch. With Anakin in the same scene, we just want them to get away from each other as quickly as possible.Natalie Portman is back as Amidala, no longer a Queen but now a senator. She too seems to have lost her way.  Where in the first episode her character was multi-dimensional, here it is peculiarly one note, showing none of the complexity or passion hinted at  in Phantom.  Because of this, the most important plot development in Clones, the love story between Anakin and Padme, completely falls apart.  I'm not one to beat a dead horse, or a good actor when he's down, but apparently Hayden Christiansen has the acting ability of a dead horse.  His portrayal of Anakin in Clones is the worst thing to happen in a movie series since that alien creature popped out of Ripley's midsection in the third Alien movie.  Whether it's just bad acting, bad directing, a bad script, or perhaps a combination of the three we may never know.  We can only hope that by the time episode three rolls out in 2005, Hayden learns a few things, excuse me I mean a whole big lot of things about character and acting. 
The love story between Padme and Anakin has about as much spark in it as an old episode of The Love Boat.  I almost expected Lauren Tewes and Fred Gandy to make a cameo appearance at any second.  Seems Anakin has had the hots for Padme since we left him in Phantom Menace when he was about ten years old. This becomes apparent when Anakin and Obi-wan arrive to protect Padme, with dialogue so silly and painful, we not only groan, we grit our teeth and grimace.  There is no reason at all for any relationship to develop between these two, and as annoying as Anakin is about the whole thing, I half expected Padme to tell him to buzz off at any moment.  If you can't believe the love story, can you honestly believe anything that happens here on out?The other important thing that happens to Anakin comes about midway through the movie when he goes to visit his Mother.  Supposedly this has a lot to do with his going to the Dark Side of the Force.  We can only think that if he was intent on breaking a few Jedi rules, why did he wait so long?  (These Jedi rules seem to pop up now and then as some kind of albatross to put around Anakins neck to help him to the dark side).There are a few good things going on here.  The most interesting characters are Jango Fett and his son Boba.  The relationship here between father and son, is far more provocative than anything that happens between Anakin and Padme.  Samuel L. Jackson is given a bit more to do as Mace Windu, and Ian McDiarmid as sneakily menacing as Palpatine as is Christopher Lee as Count Dooku.  There are the usual great sequences George Lucas goes through great pains to but on the screen, a sky chase, a flight through asteroids, the fight between Jengo and Obi-wan on Kamino.  It is as usual good eye candy and that is what draws most people including myself back to these, but after a while, even that becomes tedious.  Even the battle between Yoda and Dooku did little to excite me.So what about Episode 3?  Lucas left a lot of questions and Plot points from Episode One unanswered, the main one being who is Anakin's Father if he has one?  It is not even mentioned in Clones.  He will not only have a lot of loose ends to tie up, he will have to give the audience a reason to care about it.  My two biggest hopes are this, first that he consulted a good screenwriter about his script, and second, had someone give Hayden Christiansen some acting lessons.  Make that a lot of acting lessons.  Make that a great big huge bunch of acting lessons.  Till next time..Next class please.",3,1,2,12 July 2003
Notting Hill," Everyone's romantic fantasy
","Just about any Romantic film that comes out of Hollywood is practically pure fantasy.  Knowing that doesn't deter us from watching films like Casablanca and wishing we could be either Bogart or Bergman, seeing Gone With The Wind for the millionth time and viewing ourselves as Gable or Leigh or sailed on the Titanic as DiCaprio or Winslet.  Who hasn't gone through adolescence and at some point daydreamed about the possibilities of meeting and falling in love with your favorite film star?  It is this fantasy that Notting Hill fulfills for us in a wonderful romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts.As William Thacker, Hugh Grant plays the average everyday sort of guy who owns and operates a travel book store in the Notting Hill section of London. On a day that starts out as any other, famous film star Anna Scott(Roberts) wanders into his book shop.  After Anna has some juice spilled on her, William offers to let her use her flat to clean up.  She seems to be appreciative of William's help, even if he is quite the bungler who hardly knows what to say in her presence.  When she leaves his apartment, William is sure his brief brush with a star has come and gone, but surprisingly Anna calls and invites him to a press junket at her hotel.  From here, the romance begins but it is not going to be an easy path to love.  There are plenty of pitfalls and hurdles on the path to true love in any romance, but they are magnified ten times over in a relationship such as this.Hugh Grant may not be every person's cup of tea but in Notting Hill he truly shines.  He plays William as an ordinary everyday kind of guy, who loves has family no matter how strange and quirky they may be, is willing to put up with his very strange roommate Spike (Rhys Ifans), and though well aware of Anna's stardom is still able to see she is  a person who has emotions just as you or I or he does.  He enables us to believe that he is falling in love with the person and not the name.  As for Julia Roberts, I have no idea how much of her character is based on her own real personality, but it wouldn't be a stretch to say she has included at least some of her own self into her role as Anna.  There are times when she seems truly vulnerable, and at other times she seems unable to let the real person of Anna show for fear of being compromised in some manner.  In one of the film's best moments, at a dinner with Williams family, Anna gives a speech about stardom and how sometimes it's not what it's cracked up to be.  It's a revealing moment, and there is no doubt that she could easily be talking about Julia Roberts and not just Anna Scott.The supporting cast in this film is also remarkable.  Rhys Ifan's Spike is about as dingy a character as one would ever want to meet and simply hilarious.  There is also a touching sub-story beautifully played out about William's friend Max (Tim McInnery)and his wheelchair bound wife Bell(Gina Mckee).  They have several moments together in this film that will easily touch your heart.  As William's sister Honey(Emma Chambers)is almost as quirky as Spike, but shows a bit more emotional depth.  Alec Baldwin makes a brief appearance as Anna's boyfriend, and handles the part of your basic 'too big of a star jerk' quite well.  Director Roger Michell gives us some wonderfully staged scenes in this film and each one is played out with perfection.  When William goes to meet Anna for the first time at her hotel, he is mistaken for a writer and is made to interview the other stars from Anna's film.  Later, when he takes Anna to meet his family and friends, it is a birthday party you won't soon forget.Yes, like all romantic comedies, Notting Hill is a fantasy film, but it shares and fulfills a certain kind of romantic fantasy we have all wished for at some time in our life. A truly wonderful film.My Grade: A",9,0,0,3 February 2004
Cold Mountain," A tale of two movies
","When Miramax spends $80 million dollars of their money to back a film, then spends another $25 million for marketing it, you can be sure that they expect huge things in return for their investment.  Then again what studio doesn't?   Most studios are pleased as punch when their films simply give them a profitable return on their investment.  I'm sure Miramax loves a profit margin as well as any other studio but for films like Cold Mountain they make them because of the little visions of gold Oscar statuettes dancing around like so many sugar plums in Harvey Weinstein's head.  Nothing wrong with that either, I suppose, but when you set out to make a film with winning awards being a top priority, everybody had better be at the top of their game.  It is apparent in Cold Mountain that everyone involved is trying hard to achieve greatness.Minghella bring us the riveting stories of a Confederate Soldier, Inman Balis, struggling to find his way back home to the life and the woman he loves, Ada Monroe.  Ada, at the same time is struggling to hold on to her farm with the help of Mountain woman Ruby Thewes.Cold Mountain is a breathtaking film to look at.  John Seale's cinematography of Civil War Battles and landscape is almost worth the price of admission alone.  Dante Ferrati's production design, especially in an early battle sequence will leave you gasping. Along with Minghella's direction, it will remind one of the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan.  In other words, war is chaos and hell, and there's not much glory in getting your body parts blown around the battle field.I can find no fault with the acting in this film either.  Though some have been critical of Nicole Kidman performance and most notably her accent. I found her southern accent to be every bit on a par with many others who have played the Southern Belle but were hardly from the South.  It is (the accent) easily comparable to that of Vivien Leigh's Scarlett in Gone With The Wind.  As for her performance, it is a role that is not demonstrative, requires reserve and Kidman gives it exactly that.  So why fault an actress for staying in character and bringing to life the role of Ada Monroe as it was meant to be?Jude Law will quickly make you forget his robotic role in AI. As Inman Balis, he too is a quiet reserved Confederate soldier, who is willing to fight for the cause up until he has nothing left to give, and begins to see how hopeless and pointless the bloodletting has become.   
As mountain woman, Ruby Thewes, Renee Zellweger nearly steals the show. When she shows up to aid Ada in putting her farm back together, she brings new life to the film and the audience.  Having watched as Ada struggles just to stay alive, and as Inman deserts the Confederate Army, Ruby gives us a shining glimmer of much needed hope.  She is a strong willed, no nonsense woman, and with Ada and Ada's farm sees a chance to have something that would not have been possible previously.  There is not enough words available to me to talk about the excellence of the rest of the supporting cast.  Brenden Gleeson plays Ruby's no good father who returns for a last chance at redemption.  Eileen Atkins as the always concerned, always giving friend Maddy, who after witnessing one of many senseless acts of brutality in this film, is forever changed.  Natalie Portman as the young widow Sara, trying to deal with the loss of her husband while raising her ill child will make you forget completely about her stale performance in Attack of the Clones.  Ray Winstone, who plays the head of the local home guard, is as evil and lecherous a villain to ever disgrace the South.  Donald Sutherland is also on hand giving a touching portrayal as Ada's father.So, with all the great cast and production values, why does Cold Mountain fail to achieve greatness?  Unfortunately, it just tries to do way too much. Most of the blame is with the screenplay, and the rest of it has to be placed on the shoulders of director Minghella.  In trying to bring us so much story, we are never quite drawn into it the way we should be.  At times we are with Inman as he fights to make his way home, then we are returned to the story of Ada and Ruby on the home front. What this does is shortchange both stories.  The opening scenes between Kidman and Law pass by so quickly that we never truly understand the chemistry between them.  This is made even more difficult because Ada and Inman are both quiet and reserved by nature.  We can see where they may be attracted to one another but we never feel it in our hearts.  Ada's struggles on the farm and Inman's struggle to return home are both captivating in themselves but trying to tell both stories just doesn't blend together. Just as we are being drawn deeply into Inman's story, Minghella quickly whisks us away to check in on Ada and Ruby. By the time we may return to Inman's narrative, it has lost whatever momentum it might have gained.  I would have like to have seen a film about the story of Ada Monroe, Ruby Thewes, Maddy and Teague.  A film about a Confederate soldier deserting the army to return home would also have been a great film.  Putting these two stories together is trying to give us too much of a good thing, and sometimes it's better to have just enough than overfilling the cup.My Grade A-",8,1,1,2 February 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Third movie does it's best to make two previous films pointless
","****Plot Points In This Review****I went into Terminator 3 with high hopes and high expectations.  What I left with, was the same feeling I had after viewing Alien 3 for the first time. It had somehow accomplished nothing more than tarnishing the two films that had come before it. Through two Terminator films, we were led to believe that things that happen in the future could be changed, that certain things didn't have to be inevitable.  With Terminator 3, we find out that was all nonsense, that there was no reason for the existence of the first two movies at all, because what's going to happen is going to happen and you can't do a darn thing about it. (just delay it for a while till we can get the next movie made).  So what we end up with is three movies from the George Lucas School of prequels, though we didn't know it till now.  Thanks, but no thanks for cluing us in.There are plenty of exciting action and chase sequences in the film, and they do grab your attention while they are on the screen.  Still, they are nothing more or less than we've seen in any other Summer Blockbuster, so I can't recommend seeing this movie on that alone.  Schwarzenegger does his usual fine one note job as The Terminator, but Nick Stahl's John Connor is so wimpy, we long for Edward Furlong to pop up and give him a swift kick in the pants.  Clare Danes as Kate Brewster, Connor's future wife, is by far more interesting, and you begin to wonder how John Connor and not her ever became the one to lead the rise against the machines.  It almost makes you glad that in the future a Terminator does take out John Connor.  I for one would feel a lot better about it if Kate were leading my revolution. Kristana Lokken, despite not having much to do except morph, is menacing enough, but no more or no less than Robert Patrick was in the previous film. She just has the advantage of having a few more tricks up her sleeve.Will there ever be a Terminator 4?  Could happen I suppose, if this one makes the major dollars as the previous films did.  Trouble is, we now know the ending, and as in the Star Wars prequels, when you know what is going to happen, getting there just isn't that much fun anymore.",4,0,0,3 July 2003
"I, Robot"," My own three rules for I, Robot
","When I saw the first early trailers of I, Robot, I can honestly say I was not impressed.  Much of those early glimpses featured a wise cracking Will Smith doing his best Eddie Murphy joke a minute imitation while investigating whether or not a robot of the future had committed a murder, something they were thought to be incapable of doing.  Later trailers dispensed with most of the jokes, and showed us a more serious side of the film and I began to have hopes that I, Robot might be better than I initially thought.  This in turns brings me to the first rule of the three laws of movie reviewing:1.	First impressions do count for somethingThe reason I bring this up is because Isaac Asimov also gave us some rules. These are THE THREE RULES by which robots of the future must abide by: 1.	A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. 2.	A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. 3.	A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.Now that you know those rules you can forget about them because the I, Robot you see on the screen makes little use of any of those rules.  You know going in that the robots are going to run amok, rules or no rules which means the only use for them in this film is so we know that these robots are going to break every one of them.  What I, Robot also does is to take a great idea by Asimov with infinite possibilities and conflicts,  and turns it into another long winded CGI filled yarn with Smith thrown in to play a bad ass cop straight out of Bad Boys.In the world of the 2035, it seems robots will become an important part of most of our lives doing many of the mundane tasks we have grown accustomed to doing for ourselves.   Police Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is an odd kind of chap.  He hates robots and doesn't think they can be trusted. When a friend of his, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who works at major robot supplier U.S. Robotics, appears to have committed suicide, Del begins to suspect that it wasn't suicide at all and a robot might have committed the crime.  When Del finds the good doctor's favorite robot, Sonny, hiding in the same room that Lanning performed his swan dive from, Sonny quickly becomes major suspect number one.  Of course nobody, including psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynihan), the owner of the company, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood), and his boss Lt. Bergin (Chi McBride) believes such a thing could be possible as no robot could conceivable break or even bend THE THREE RULES.  It seems because of Del's robot psychosis, he's cried wolf one too many times.  And there, in a nutshell is where a lot of the problems with I, Robot begins.  Although Del's hatred of robots is eventually explained, it comes off as nothing more than a plot contrivance so that Del can play the part of Chicken Little.  When will filmmakers learn that there are THE THREE RULES in regards to such plot contrivances?1.	A hero in a film that continually suspects the innocent or is constantly making unfounded accusations will never be believed.2.	A hero in a film who makes such accusations will never be believed until it's too late.  Even if the audience knows he's telling the truth.3.	Any use of the first two rules makes your film predictable, repetitive and boring and are totally unnecessary.As if one plot contrivance isn't enough, I, Robot hampers itself with two of them.  Because of the same situation that led to Del hating robots, it seems Del is also sporting a bionic arm.  Why does a character have a bionic arm? Because there are THE THREE RULES of having a character pretending to be The Six Million Dollar Man.1.	A character sports a bionic arm so that at some point it will accidentally become uncovered to surprise the audience.2.	The Bionic arm will eventually be uncovered by the female love interest so that she can appear sympathetic and understanding towards the hero.3.	The Bionic arm can be used to perform impossible feats flesh and bone can't, thus enabling the screenwriter an easy way to write the hero out of situations he wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell of escaping.
 The early scenes when Del is questioning Sonny are interesting and hold promise, but it doesn't take long before I, Robot disintegrates into one long CGI chase after another, making little use of its initial premise.  We know the robots are going to run amok.  We know that there is more to Sonny than meets the eye.  We know that Del will somehow escape every dangerous situation he encounters keeping in the tradition started by James Bond some 40 years ago.  We know that Susan will eventually believe him and turn into his best ally.  We know as soon as U.S. Robotics start delivering thousands upon thousands of robots they will be marching down the street like so many metal clad Nazis.    What's really sad about I, Robot, is so much is wasted by its predictable plot, its unending chase sequences, and even more predictable convenient plot devices.  The robots are fascinating to watch and the CGI created Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk) gives the most intricate and interesting performance in the film.  Maybe they should have created a CGI Del character also.  The visual effects are stunning and interesting to watch, but the fact remains that when you have viewed so many of these artificially created worlds with a new one hitting the screen almost weekly, without anything worthwhile going on, they end up becoming nothing more than watching the latest Playstation or X Box video game without getting to participate.
Earlier I mentioned one of my THE THREE RULES of movie reviewing.   Let's review:1.	First impressions do count for something2.	Second Impressions are okay if your first impression is wrong.  Second impressions are most welcome especially if your first impression is negative.3.	If my first impression is totally negative, and the second impression agrees with the first impression, than I have no choice but to give you my grade.And for I, Robot it's a D+.",4,0,0,26 July 2004
Van Helsing," Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolves, Dracula, Mr. Hyde, the gangs all here.
","I think I've got this film critic business figured out.  After reading many of the reviews for Van Helsing, the great majority of which soundly panned the film, I have come to the following conclusion:  Critics loathe the summer film season.  They especially seem to loathe high budgeted special effects extravaganzas such as Van Helsing, especially when the trailers for it have been bombarding our senses for months, and you can't turn on the TV without hearing about it.  One would have to assume that they when they view a film such as this, there is a certain amount of bias working against it. So in reviewing the $200 million dollar Universal extravaganza, I think my job is supposed to be to blast the film into Hades with another scathing review.  Sorry, I can't do it. As it turns out, I did enjoy the film.What Writer and Director Stephen Sommers does do is to entertain us with a multitude of exciting hair raising sequences, aided by some spectacular CGI effects, and a cast of characters that hearken back to the old black and white films of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, and Dracula. Even Mr. Hyde is on hand briefly to liven things up.  The film opens with a black and white sequence that is straight out of the original Frankenstein film.  Everything is here just as it should be, including Dr. Frankenstein, his not so loyal servant Igor, the monster himself, and the torch bearing citizens of Transylvania who are intent on having Frankenburgers courtesy of the Doctor and his protégé. What is different however, is that Count Dracula himself is on hand for the unveiling of Dr. Frankenstein's Monster, and has his own personal agenda to attend to.  Unfortunately for Count Dracula, the Monster regards Dr. Frankenstein as Daddy Dr. Frankenstein, and doesn't take too kindly to what the Count has in store for him.  It's a stunning, cleverly written opening to the film, and sets a relentless which barely leaves you time to breathe as it hurdles on fast forward from one action laden episode to the next.From the creation of Frankenstein Monster's we are immediately taken to the Notre Dame Cathedral where Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, is doing battle with Dr. Jekyll's alter ego Mr. Hyde.  By placing Hyde in the cathedral, Sommers manages also to pay a little big of homage to The Hunchback of Notre Dame. His mission, which comes directly from Rome, is to try and bring Hyde back to Rome alive to be studied if possible.  It is here with his own wry perspective on the matter that Jackman reminded me of a late nineteenth century James Bond.  He'll do the job and get it done, but he'll do it his way, orders or no orders.  It's a nice minor touch that immediately gives Jackman's Van Helsing a distinctive touch of personality not seen in any previous film incarnation of the character.Later, Van Helsing is ordered by Rome to travel to Transylvania to aid the lovely Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) in her quest to find and destroy Count Dracula.  It seems Anna and the family from which she is descended from, have been after Dracula for some time.  The only members of the family who are left to continue on with the quest are Anna and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp), and should they die before finishing their mission, their family will be damned to eternity in purgatory.  Along with Van Helsing is a Rome inventor and sidekick, Carl (David Wenham).  (He's a Friar not a Monk, and so is entitled to certain worldly pleasures).  It's a great bit that adds  some welcome humorous touches, lest we begin taking things a bit too serious.Where this film also excels is not just the adrenaline rushing action sequences.  Sommers uses the CGI, not just for a myriad of heart-pounding special effects,  but is smart enough to create an atmosphere where we can easily accept the notion that this is indeed Europe in the late nineteenth century.  In one scene, as the camera traverses the landscape of Paris, we see in the background a half-built Eiffel Tower.  It is this kind of meticulous attention to details that help lift this film a couple of notches above others in the genre by transporting us into a world we can immerse ourselves in completely.If the film has a fault, it is minor.  In the early moments, one is not sure if we are going to be witnessing an action film or a spoof.  Much of this is due to the initial campy over the top portrayal of Dracula by Richard Roxburgh and a few of his female disciples.  After the opening sequence during the creation of Frankenstein's Monster, Roxburgh and everyone else seems to settle down into just the right tone needed for the remainder of the running time.If you go into Van Helsing knowing that your are going to get two hours plus of non-stop sights and sounds to hammer your senses, along with some harmless mindless entertainment, you'll enjoy the film in all aspects.  It is highly imaginative, and very entertaining.  I had fun, and that's all I asked for.  And if I get what I ask for I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Van Helsing is a B+.",7,0,0,8 May 2004
Spider-Man," Raimi and Maguire weave a magical web in this excellent comic adaptation
","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. 
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A.",10,104,136,9 April 2004
The Exorcist," The Devil Made Her Do It
","In late 1973 and early 1974, women and men were lined up for blocks. People were known to become ill watching it. Some fainted. Some ran out of the theater in tears. There were reports of people having to be institutionalized, and at least one miscarriage was attributed to viewing it. No, it wasn't a Rolling Stones Concert. It was a film called The Exorcist.The first time I had heard of something called The Exorcist was on late night television when the author, William Peter Blatty, was a guest on The Tonight Show. The conversation centered around how horrible some of the things in the book were. I had also seen the novel listed on The New York Times Bestseller List, and it seemed as if it would remain there forever. After having been on the waiting list for what seemed like an eternity at the local library, I was finally able to obtain a copy. It was the first book I had read in one sitting since probably Nancy Drew and The Hidden Staircase quite a few years earlier. And yes, for it's time it was filled with gut wrenching details of what happens when for some unexplained reason; an innocent girl is possessed by Satan. While reading the book I was sure that if it ever made its way to film, most of the details would certainly be either `cleaned up' or omitted altogether. As you know the film was made and it spared the movie going public absolutely nothing in the way of details.Certainly many of the people who lined up to see The Exorcist did so to watch some of the more gruesome scenes, the worst of which involved Regan's masturbation with a crucifix. Yet, the hysteria went well beyond the fact that such scenes were so vividly depicted. I think one needs to look no further than Mel Gibson's The Passion to find the answer as to why. I'm sure most of you have read the story of people leaving Mel's film in tears, some to the point of being hysterical. From most articles I have read, it seems that the majority of the audience that was moved were those people of strong religious beliefs. For many others, the depiction of the brutality in The Passion may have been uncomfortable to sit through, but weren't emotionally effected to any degree. Much of this same feeling can explain the hysteria surrounding The Exorcist. Those who had a definitive belief in Heaven and Hell, of Good and Evil, of Jesus as The Savior and Satan as the epitome of pure evil were affected by The Exorcist far more than those who were agnostic or just never had a strong belief in spiritual matters. There is no doubt though that much in the way The Passion did, The Exorcist caused many to reconsider how they felt about their faith. The Exorcist made the prospect of Satan being alive and well and a life of eternal damnation a very uncomfortable prospect. The fact that Blatty claims his book and screenplay were based on a true story seemed to give the film even more credibility.For me, The Exorcist has always been more about the never ending conflict between pure evil and pure innocence than about being an average horror story. There are many more levels to this film than what initially meets the eye. There is no doubt that while the main story revolves around an innocent young girl, Regan McNeil (Linda Blair), being inhabited by Satan himself, Blatty enhances it greatly by adding different characters in various stages of conflict. Regan's mother, Chris McNeil (Ellen Burstyn) obviously cares deeply for her daughter. Yet she is not beyond reproach. In one scene when Reagan's father hasn't called on Regan's birthday, we see her desperately on the phone doing battle with an overseas operator. The problem is not how vicious the phone call is, but that she does it within ear shot of her daughter as if to drive the point home to Regan how worthless her father is. When, she finally does seek the aid of Father Damian Karras, we don't feel that she believes in exorcism anymore than he does, but is desperate enough to accept the fact that it is possible and will take any and all measures to save her daughter.Father Karras (Jason Miller) is a priest torn by conflict. He is ridden by overwhelming guilt for having abandoned his mother to enter the priesthood. He is torn spiritually by the confessions of those priests who seek his help as a psychiatrist, so much so that he now questions his own faith. When he states to the Bishop that `Regan's case meets all the criteria,' we know that even more than Chris, he doesn't really believe in the power of Satan to inhabit a living being in the manner that it has taken over Regan. Yet, he will do what is required of him as a priest concerned about the health of a child.Jack McGowran gives a terrific performance as the alcoholic director filming Chris's latest film in Georgetown. Kitty Winn is Sharon Spencer, the secretary who works for Chris and always seems to be in the line of fire when Chris is angry. She is always there but for all the horror she witnesses, Winn appears too bland and emotionless and her performance is probably the weakest in the film.Max Von Sydow as Father Lancester Merrin is a no nonsense aging priest. He has done battle with evil before and he shows us its effect in every scene he occupies. One could pass it off to being just good make-up but it is so much more than that as Sydow demonstrates all the nuances that brings to life a man who has faced Satan and lived to tell about it. He knows what he is up against, understands he must do it again and the consequences of what that battle may be.If I have a small complaint with The Exorcist it is in regards to the character of Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb). I have never been able to buy into the character. It is not the fault of Cobb who is his usual stalwart self in the role. The whole character should at best have only been necessary for a few brief scenes yet; he has several that go on way too long and do not add anything to the story. Even in his scenes with Chris or Damian, Kinderman is so odd that he distracts us too much from their characters and it is Chris and Damian's reactions that are more important to us, not his investigation. For all you trivia buffs out there, Blatty once sued the producers of Columbo, stating they based Peter Falk's character on Kinderman. If memory serves me correctly Blatty lost that one.As for Director William Friedken, although he won the best director award for The French Connection, for me The Exorcist will always remain his defining film. The Final half hour of The Exorcist are still as dynamic today as they were 31 years ago, French Connection car chase be damned.It seems that to many of the younger movie audiences of today, The Exorcist has become more of a joke than anything else. That's not surprising considering how many times it has been lampooned, even by Linda Blair herself in Repossessed. Yet, if they were to view the film in a more serious vein, not as just another creature feature, they may just find that there really is more to this film than a little girl spewing pea soup and spinning her head around 360 degrees. It is the ultimate battle between Heaven and Hell and Good and Evil. It is the story of the complete and total degradation of innocence. It is a study in character, and whether a man torn by the forces surrounding him, can regain his faith and his belief in God and mankind to save the life of a little girl, caught up in forces beyond her control.Call it a horror film, call it a religious film, call it what you want. For me, The Exorcist is and will always remain a classic in every sense of the word. And if I regard you as a classic of any kind I have no choice but to leave you with my grade, which for The Exorcist is an A.",10,428,505,20 July 2004
Gone with the Wind," Despite the epic grandeur, Gone With The Wind is still a performance driven film
","When I was very young, my parents would often load her eight kids into the car to see a double feature at the drive-in.  Occasionally, we were able to go to the matinee at a walk-in theater, but that was the exception rather than the rule.  There was only one occasion that I recall my mother having ventured into a regular movie theater.  That time was during a re-release of Gone With The Wind.  I knew that for her to do something so out of the ordinary would take an extraordinary event.  Because it was her all time favorite film which she had often spoken of, there was no doubt that Gone With The Wind was an exceptional film in her eyes.  The question that remains is whether it would be such a prodigious event for me.I enjoyed my first viewing of Gone With The Wind.  It didn't bore me.  Yet, I hardly remember it being unforgettable which is understandable when you're thirteen years old.  I tried reading Margaret Mitchell's novel once and believe I made it more than half way through.  It was not until years later after having viewed the film several more times that I began to appreciate the epic grandeur of Selznick's film.Many have classified Gone With The Wind as a love story told against the backdrop of the Civil War.   I think that is an oversimplification.  Though, there is a love story involved, this is strictly a film about a woman, who happens to want a man she can't have, but ends up with those men who suit her purpose to further her needs.  Scarlett O'Hara is on the surface, a spoiled rich Southern belle.  In the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, we find her conniving schemes to corral Ashley Wilkes almost humorous.   As the film progresses, and the brutality of the Civil War and its aftermath, envelop the South,   we see changes take place in Scarlett as well.  As she matures into womanhood, Scarlett remains the conniving schemer, but becomes an extremely complex character also.  Until the war, her conniving is strictly that of a lovesick teenager.  After the war her schemes are those of a woman hardened by the brutality of a vicious war, and her plans serve a distinct and powerful purpose.  We may not agree with what she does or how she does it, but we understand her motivations.To bring Scarlett to life on the screen, Selznick chose Vivien Leigh. Whether it was pure luck or fate it doesn't matter.  I can think of no other actress who could have possibly fitted the role as well as Leigh does.   If I had to name the top ten performances by an actress in a film ever, Leigh would certainly be in the top ten if not at the top of the list.Rhett Butler is the male version of Scarlett in many ways.  At one point in the film Rhett brings this fact up himself. `Because we're alike - bad lots both of us, selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names', he states.  He loves Scarlett, yet for most of the film she is out of his reach.  Only when it suits her purposes, does Scarlett give in to him.  She marries him not for love but for fun.  She may indeed love Rhett, because she is stubborn and self-centered, Scarlett can't acknowledge it.  Just as Vivien Leigh is the only actress I can picture as Scarlett, Clark Gable is the definitive Rhett.  There is no denying the chemistry between Rhett and Scarlett when these two great actors are on the screen together.  I have seen many of Gable's films, and have never seen him as good as he is in Gone With The Wind.If the film has one flaw for me in the acting department, it's Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes.  Although Ashley is a noble character, he is weak and wishy washy.  He is unable to tell Scarlett his true feelings one way or the other, yet is able to fight nobly for the Confederacy.  Howard manages to convey the indecisiveness and the weaknesses of the character, yet he fails to do anything to have us believe there is a reason why someone as strong willed as Scarlett might find him remotely attractive.Melanie Hamilton Wilkes epitomizes the example of pure goodness and greatness that one could only hope to achieve in life.  Yet, she sees in Scarlett a zest for living that seems to be unattainable to herself. Because of this and the fact that she finds it difficult to find the evil in anyone, Melanie is blinded to Scarlett's love for Ashley.  Olivia de Havilland gives us a Melanie every bit as real as Rhett and Scarlett.Of all the characters in Gone With The Wind, Mammy is the one who is shrewd enough and smart enough to see everyone for what they really are.   It is a fact that continually infuriates Scarlett.  Hattie McDaniel's  Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of  Mammy may be the most deserving of all.  When she is on the screen, her presence overshadows that of even Leigh.For all of Selznick's attention to detail, for all the grandeur of the Southern Plantations, for the incredible scenes of the burning of Atlanta and the long back wards crane shot of the thousands of wounded soldier lying in the streets, without the complex characters, and the incredible performances by the actors to portray them, Gone With The Wind would quite possibly have never achieved the historical significance that it has.  It is this fact that makes it a great film. My Grade A+",10,2,3,11 February 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Kutcher answers his critics with the very good Butterfly Effect
","If one had read any of the recent publicity surrounding The Butterfly Effect or Ashton Kutcher, that person, myself included, could hardly be blamed for expecting the worse.  In case you missed it here's a quick rundown: 1. Cameron Crowe decided not to go with Kutcher in Elizabethtown supposedly because of his lack of acting ability 2. The Butterfly Effect was supposedly laughed out of The Sundance Film Festival 3. For some unexplained reason Kutcher was left uncredited in Cheaper By The Dozen 4. The January release date meant the film was being dumped. On a lazy wet winter day in Northern California, my companion and I decided to brave all and take in a movie.  With January pickings being what they are, we had narrowed our choice down to Mona Lisa Smile or The Butterfly Effect.  As it turned out, Mona Lisa had already packed her bags and left town so The Butterfly Effect won out by default. Neither of us had much hope. About thirty minutes into The Butterfly Effect I looked at my companion, she looked back at me and it was the good old 'Hey, this is a good movie' kind of look.  It's hard to say which of us was more surprised or more pleased.In any film about time travel, there is always going to be plot holes. It kind of goes with the territory.  In some films these holes are so big you could fly a 747 through them. In others they are small enough that you see them, but are willing to forgive them because the film is good enough that you don't really care to do the nit picking necessary to dig them out. Butterfly effect falls into the latter category, with a good script and a story that grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go of you.  You can thank J. Mackeye Gruber and Eric Bress for directing and writing a story that pretty much covers the bases.Butterfly Effect deals with the time honored story about what would happen if one could change the past.  This concept has been covered in good films before such as what happened in It's A Wonderful Life if George Bailey had never been born or Marty McFly's adventures in Back To The Future. In the 1980 film The Final Countdown the writers had a chance to become a defining film in this genre but copped out in the last moments of the film.  The Butterfly Effect does not cop out.A good portion of the early moments of the film, explain the horrid childhood and catastrophic events that befall Evan Treborn and his friends. Yet, we do not witness the entirety of these events, as Evan suffers from blackouts, and when he does, the scenes jump to where he awakens and we awaken with him.  The idea works to perfection.  It is not until later, when Evan returns to the past to alter these events that the audience along with him has the gaps filled in.  As Evan tries to change the past, he finds that as awful as these events in his past may have been, the results of changing them can be worse.I was about as far from being an Ashton Kutcher fan as one could be before seeing this film.  I had only seen snippets of That 70's show and wasn't impressed.  I had witnessed just enough of Punk'd to become annoyed with it. And although there were a very few good comedic moments in Just Married the film itself was less than run-of-the-mill.  In The Butterfly Effect, Kutcher will have many taking another look at his acting ability.  In playing Evan Treborn, Kutcher had a difficult task that required great changes in his character when he returns from his journey to the past.  He hits all the right notes, never overplays the part, and seems to have lost his Punk'd persona completely.  It will cause many to give him another look.Amy Smart as his girlfriend Kayleigh Miller is just as good if not better. Her role was the most difficult of all as it is Kayleigh who undergoes the most drastic changes as Evan wanders through time.  Kudos also to Eldon Henson and William Lee Scott.  I've never seen a film where so much change in character was required and the actors were able to make it all believable.  They deserve great praise.  Eric Stoltz as an alcoholic pedophile takes a difficult role also and gives it the kind of creepy smugness that will run shivers down your spine.  The child actors used to portray the young version of the characters are equally terrific. This is great praise indeed coming from myself, as I can be quite the curmudgeon when it comes to child actors.After having viewed The Butterfly Effect, I went back and read some of the negative reviews, not only on IMDB but others as well.  What I found in many of these reviews, was that it seemed some critics did let preconceived notions influence them. Yet even in their negativity begrudgingly gave the film some respect.  In one review, a critic spent the first half of the review as if trying to find the bad, yet spent their last three paragraphs writing as if the film deserved praise.  In the other reviews, some critics spent several paragraphs trying to find pithy phrases to degrade the Ashton Kutcher persona giving little mention of the film itself.  Shame on them, but congratulations to those IMDB voters who saw through the nonsense and graded the film on it's rightful merits.Driving home from the theater I thought about my own past. I wondered if I were to go back and change certain events how it would affect not only me but those around me and those I have known.  When a film can make you do that, it's a big success in my book.

Seabiscuit," Starts out as a necessary trot, but gallops to the finish line
","Any moviegoer who is missing Seabiscuit because they believe it is just a film about a race horse, should open their eyes, open their minds, and open their hearts to one of the most moving films to grace the multiplex in a good long while. This is not just a film about a horse, it is a film about survival, redemption, and how when things may seem as bleak as they possibly can be, one is able to overcome the toughest of circumstances and the worst of adversity. After an endless summer of moronic sequels with an endless supply of car chases, gun fire and explosions, Seabiscuit stands out as a true gem in an endless sea of summer motion picture muck.Some people may find the first forty-five minutes or so of Seabiscuit slow going. That was my response, as I,like many people, wanted to hurry up and get to the horse racing scenes. As the story developed though I realized it was these early scenes in the film that made it so much more than what it would have been otherwise.  Without them, it could very well have been just a story about a horse, and many things that happen later wouldn't have had near the emotional impact that they possess.It is in the early stages that we meet Charles Howard, (Jeff Bridges who has his best role in many years), a millionaire who seems to have everything, until one day his son is killed in an accident, and his wife leaves him. Then there is Red Pollard, whom we meet as a young boy (Michael Angarano) that is sent away by his parents after they have lost everything during the depression.  Later, as a young adult(Tobey Maguire), we see him give up being a jock, become a boxer where he loses the sight in one eye and then become nothing more than a stable boy walking horses.  Next there is Tom Smith(Chris Cooper), an out of work mustang breaker, who basically wonders around the West with little to do, out of a job and down on his luck.  It is after Howard meets up with Smith, that on Smith's advice he purchases a horse called Seabiscuit that most experts thought would never win anything. Later, after watching Red Pollard walking a horse (in a very funny scene), Howard hires him also.  From then on we are totally engrossed, as these three men and a horse, overcome all odds to not only find their own souls, but likewise rally a nation that had been beaten down by the depression. They give a country hope at a time when many people did not know if they would have a meal from day to day, or whether they may ever work again. They gave them something to cheer for, and us as a film audience, to cheer along with them.I cannot praise highly enough the work of director Gary Ross and the three main actors in Seabiscuit.  Ross, who also gave us the wonderfully underrated film Pleasantville, has done exemplary work here also. Maguire, Cooper, and Bridges are perfect in their three roles.  These are the most difficult kind of roles for many actors.  There is no scene chewing going on here.  They stay within their characters the whole film, which requires a more subtle approach then the kind of over the top performances that usually win Academy Awards.   The only role that requires any outlandishness is that of Tick Tock, the track announcer, wonderfully played by William H. Macy for comic relief.  Also on hand is Elizabeth Banks as the second Mrs. Howard. She isn't given much to do in this film, but shows she is every bit as capable as the men.There are times during Seabiscuit when you will laugh, times when you may find your eyes moistening just a bit, and times when you will applaud and cheer as the audience did when I saw it. Best of all, when you leave the theater, you will leave with a sense of warmth and appreciation, for easily the finest film of not only this summer, but of a lot of summers.",10,0,0,4 August 2003
Hellboy," The Professor And The Beast
","If you were to break down the beginning of Hellboy in it's simplest terms, the Nazi's, aided by Rasputin of Nicholas and Alexandria fame, go messing around with the occult to bring forth some evil doers to aid Hitler in his conquest of the worlds.  Those doggone Nazis!!!  If they weren't out looking for the Lost Ark or the Holy Grail then they're messing around with the Dark Forces.  One would have to wonder how they ever found time to fight a war. Before they can succeed with their plan however, a battalion of U.S. soldiers, aided by a young Professor Bruttenholm, thwart their misdeeds, but not before a cute devilish baby pops into our world.  He is captured by the Professor, who promptly gives him the name Hellboy, and we fast forward a few decades to the present.  The Professor (now played by John Hurt)has raised the little dickens to manhood so that he is now played by Ron Perlman.  Having played the Beast Vincent in the TV series Beauty and The Beast in the late 1980's, Perlman is a an old pro at working in heavy makeup.  As Hellboy, the makeup is mostly red, he has horns that he keeps grinding flat to make him look more like a human, but he sports a tail so that's pretty much a useless endeavor.  He is now used by the FBI, to combat the forces of evil.  Unfortunately, the writers and director decided to gum up the works by throwing in everything but the kitchen sink.  The plot in this film becomes so convoluted at times, an extra strength bottle of Drano couldn't clear it up and I'm not sure I'll have much success either but I'll give it a shot.First off, there's the thing about Rasputin (Karel Rodan).  He's there with the Nazi's for Hellboy's coming out party but we don't know how he got there.  Then there's a blond woman named Ilsa (Bridget Hodson). There's also some weird guy named Kroenen (Ladislav Beran) who we find out later seems to have been stitched together by an apprentice of Dr. Frankenstein.  Having escaped from Professor Bruttenholm's war party, they survive into the present day, without ever aging.  Then with a little bit of Hocus Pocus Alakazam, they summon up some CGI Demons for Hellboy to do battle with.  The problem with this demon is that every time one is defeated, two takes it's place. So, soon they're multiplying faster than you can say Roger Rabbit, and Hellboy and the rest of the world is in big trouble.  Again, I have written what happens in it's most simplest of terms so you might be able to follow it.  The explanations and reasoning used in the film are partially non existent and the rest of it is a bunch of mumbo jumbo hooey that you won't understand anyway.  What makes all this so irritating is that it is absolutely unnecessary.  There are a lot of good things going on in Hellboy that are completely wasted because of the overbearing plot laid into the film.The biggest mistake Director and Writer Guillermo Del Toro makes, is that once we see the origin of Hellboy, he skips directly into his adulthood to expedite things.  We know the Professor raises him almost like his own son, but we don't have a clue as to any of the psychological or inner makeup of Hellboy.  We know he likes Candy bars, we learn he likes to take off some times against the professor's wishes, we find out he loves a good cigar, but little else.  We simply don't have a clue as to anything about him on a personal level.  It's not Perlman's fault.  He is terrific as Hellboy, often using a dry sarcastic kind of no nonsense wit, and Perlman always seems to be having a blast.  However, since we know so little about him as flesh and blood, we can't identify with him and we end up regarding him as nothing more than what he is on paper which is a comic book hero.As if we needed reminding of the major failing of the film, Del Toro also gives us a love interest for Hellboy.  It seems Hellboy is carrying the torch for a pyrokineticist named Liz (Selma Blair). Think of Drew Barrymore in Firestarter and you've got the idea.  Blair also gives another good performance as Liz, a woman tortured by her existence.  Strangely, Del Toro does give us a brief glimpse into Liz's childhood, and because of it we understand her better than we do anything about Hellboy.  We are however, never given a clue as to how the Liz and Hellboy met, how he fell for her, why she left the compound he lives in or anything else for that matter. There is one great scene where Liz goes for a walk with John Myers(Rupert Evans)and a jealous Hellboy follows them.  It's one of the few moments of humanity given to Hellboy, and it's a big pay off.  If only there had been more moments like this than it would have been time better spent. Hellboy is also not the only superhero to inhabit the lab where he is kept. There is sort of an Aquaman type being by the name of Abe Sapien who swims around in a tank, eats rotten eggs, and his psychic powers that he uses to aid Hellboy.  He is one of the most believable CGI characters I've ever seen in a film of this type, aided measurably by the voice of David Hyde Pierce. It would have been more interesting to have seen how the relationship between Abe, the professor, and Hellboy developed if Del Toro hadn't been in such a hurry to get to his idiot plot in order to burn up his special effects budget to the max.As for the special effects and the battle scenes, they are terrific just for the sheer spectacle, and it's fun to watch and listen to Hellboy as he goes to war against the monsters.  The problem with these scenes though are the same with everything else about this film.  The origin of the monsters and everything about them is so murky, and jumped into so fast, that even these scenes are viewed from a dispassionate distance.Benico Del Toro had all the tools to make the beginnings of a great new comic book series on film.  Unfortunately, when you have the tools and the only thing you can manage is to build a motorboat instead of the ARK, then I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Hellboy is a C.",5,0,1,5 April 2004
Back to the Future Part III," Marty, Doc, Zemeckis, And Gale pay homage to the Old West
","Having set a new standard in time travel films with Back To The Future and Back To The Future Part II, it was with eager anticipation that I looked forward to seeing if Robert Zemeckis could bring his trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.  To conclude any trilogy in a successful manner some of the key ingredients you need are:  1. do something in your wrap up you haven't done before 2. keep the main characters true to what they have been previously 3. tie up all the loose threads and 4. give us a satisfying ending.For this third outing in the series, Zemeckis takes us where we have yet to tread, that being 1885 Hill Valley.  With Marty trapped once again in the year 1955, he enlists the 1955 Doc Brown to help him return home.  As we know by now, things are never that simple when it comes to Marty and Doc. Marty has no magic ruby slippers to click together three times and say, 'There's no place like home.'  It seems Doc ended up in the Old West, but hid the DeLorean in a cave for Marty to find some 70 years later so he may return home back to 1985 and destroy the time machine.  After discovering that Doc met with some misfortune shortly after arriving in 1885 Hill Valley, Marty decides to travel back in time to rescue him. 
While BTTFIII does not have the break neck frantic pace of Part II, it is a good film on its own.  For the first time, Zemeckis slows things down a bit, making this third film straightforward, yet just as delightful in a lot of ways as the other films.  The first thing he does is throw us a little change up.  Zemeckis and Gale decide to center the complications of this third film around Doc Brown by having him fall unexpectedly in love with a school teacher by the name of Clara(Mary Steenburgen).  In essence, Doc loses his head over a woman and loses his scientific reasoning in the process.  It is left up to Marty to become the voice of reason when Doc begins to let his emotions rule his reactions.  Yet, Marty seems as a amused as we are by the whole thing.  This is one romance that could easily have been the downfall of this film, but thanks to the performances of Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd, together they develop a chemistry that makes it all work and work to perfection.  So by having the majority of the film take place in the old west, then introducing something to the plot we didn't expect, Zemeckis takes care of the first point I mentioned above. 
There's also the matter of Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. The meanest, grimiest, filthiest, most ruthless outlaw to ever inhabit Hill Valley.  If you liked Thomas F. Wilson's portrayals of Biff, you'll be amazed at his rambunctious portrayal of Mad Dog.  He even somehow manages to top his villainous portrayals in the first two films which is not an easy task.  So yes, all the characters from the first two films are here in some form or another, and though Doc Brown may be in love, he is still the Doc.  This solidly takes care of my second point about keeping the characters true to what they have been before.Zemeckis and Gale have been absolute geniuses in writing these films.  In each film they have taken little pieces from the previous films and make them essential to what's happening.  For instance, if you've seen the second part there is a short scene that is extremely relevant to what goes on in the finale.  When originally viewing it in Part II, I'm sure you never gave it a second thought.  When the pay off comes in this film, you can't help but chuckle and say, oh I see.  As for my third point about tying up loose ends, they do that and tie up some things we didn't even know were loose ends.In Part II, it was necessary for several of the actors to play different roles.  This one is no different.  Besides being Marty Mcfly, Fox also portrays his ancestor Shamus Mcfly, who is Irish, and again Fox shows his versatility as Lea Thompson does as his wife Maggie.  Of course James Tolkan is back as Strickland and theres a couple of good jokes about his character that will surprise you...well at least one of them will surprise you the other will just leave you laughing.  As if all this wasn't good enough, Zemeckis also gives us several old western character actors, Dub Taylor, Pat Buttram, and Harry Carey Jr. Another great touch thrown in just for the fun of it.In reviewing the fist two parts of the trilogy, I failed to mention Alan Silvestri's terrific score.  All three films owe a great deal of their success to it, and the fact that he was able to keep the same theme, yet do variations on it that perfectly fitted each film deserves as much credit as all the others responsible for making this film received.So what about point 4, a satisfying ending?  Of course, you'll have to see the film to find out for yourself.  I can only say that when Part 3 was over I felt a certain amount of sadness that the trilogy had ended.  Even now when I watch the three films, I wish there had been a fourth, and a fifth. This was not because the ending of the third film left me unsatisfied in anyway, quite the contrary in fact.  It was because I would miss not only the films themselves, but most of all the rich detail and characterizations brought to life for us by a wonderful cast, director, writers and the rest of the crew responsible for enabling us to enjoy one of the most memorable series of films ever. And when you live in my memory forever, you get my grade.  For Back To The Future Part III it's an A+. As for the trilogy, there is no grade high enough, no rating high enough, for me to give it the award it so richly deserves.",8,75,82,23 March 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino becomes P.T. Barnum
","****possible spoilers****Depending on whom you talk to, Quentin Tarantino is either a great director paying homage to as many films and film genres he can dream up in his overextended forehead, or he is an unoriginal rip-off artist who's only claim to cinematic achievement is that he puts enough violent episodes in his films to please his blood-thirsty hard core fans and keep them forever loyal.  With Kill Bill, he takes things a step further by paying homage not only to grindhouse, kung-fu and Samurai films, but also P.T. Barnum.  In other words, Quent knows there's a sucker born every minute and most of them are his loyal fans.I have seen four very bad films this year: It Runs In The Family, Bad Boys II, Basic and now Kill Bill.  In Kill Bill we find out that Quent is so in love with his own directing style that he ended up totally disregarding the kind of film he was supposed to be making and instead uses his idea to try and prove how artsy and cool he still is to his adoring fans.  What is saddest of all about the whole thing is he had a good idea here, but flubs it so badly trying to be super-cool that it ends up as one over-extended mass of carnage and bloodletting that seems to go on for eternity.Tarantino claims this is his fourth film.  He proudly proclaims it in the opening titles.  What he does not proclaim proudly is that this is only the first half of his film as the words Volume I are once again almost hidden in the opening title (it appears very small as vol 1) just as it was done on the web site for the film in it the subsequent tv ads and theatrical trailers.  So in actuality this is Tarantino's third and a half film, but you won't see that title card.  I guess he's not as proud splitting the film as one would think and after viewing it, that's quite understandable but more about that later.Tarantino again refuses to be bounded by any type of linear story telling. Normally, that would not be a problem with me but if any film cried out for straight-forward story telling this one did.  After the opening scene of Bill putting The Bride into a coma for four years and after the credits roll, we immediately go to his first chapter which is a confrontation between The Bride and Copperhead  (Vivica A Fox). After dispensing with Fox in front of Fox's daughter Uma departs in her vehicle and as she crosses off the Copperhead's name, we see she has already crossed off the name of O-ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).  So at the beginning of the film we already know she has done away with one of her adversaries so when that battle does appear late in the first half of this film, any tension that might have been gained is completely destroyed in the first 16 minutes of the first half of Kill Bill. So much for non-linear story telling.  Though he likes to spill blood, Tarantino obviously hates any kind of suspense (which might explain his recent put-down of Hitchcock).  It gets worse.From there we flashback to the church where Bill shot The Bride and where his assasins created havoc on her wedding party.  After being found still alive by a sheriff and his deputies, we then get The Bride in the hospital lying in a coma.  At this time we also get Elle Driver alias California Mountain Snake alias Daryl Hannah in a split screen dressing as a nurse, filling a syringe with poison supposedly to finish The Bride off.  It is a mission we know beforehand won't succeed so when her cell phone rings and it's Bill telling her to call it off, the whole scene becomes incredibly pointless.  It is here because Tarantino wants again to show us his coolness, storytelling be damned.Soon we get more pointless Tarantino cool.  After a silly bit in the hospital where The Bride wakes up from her coma and looking to be in as good of a condition as Ali Macgraw did on her deathbed in Love Story, so much so that she is able to immediately dispense with two silly perverts. Soon, she begins talking to her toes to get them to move.  Here we get what is suppose to be a cool anime sequence, telling us the background of O-Ren Ishii who is already dead because we saw the name crossed out on The Bride's notebook, even if we haven't seen it on the screen yet.  Since we know she is dead, and we are probably going to see how she was killed soon, the whole animated sequence (and not a very good one) becomes another pointless exercise in Tarantino's 'Look at me I'm cool' disease.  It's no wonder this film ran three hours.  The rest of the first half of his film goes on and on in much the same vain - interminably so.  Even when we near the four month intermission point we get The Bride just beginning to list her targets on her notepad, so in essence when we reach the end, we are back near the beginning again.  More cool.Then there is the big fight scene where before confronting 0-Ren (who we know is already dead), The Bride must dispense with about a hundred of her comrades including a teenage girl in a catholic type school uniform.  What we get is a lot of severed limbs where everyone must have five times as much blood as the human body normally carries so Tarantino can spray it around the room like a gardener watering the lawn.  A good portion of this fight is in black and white I suppose to spare us the horror of it all.  It doesn't matter, black and white or living color, the whole bit is cartoonish and more comical than intense. The fact that Tarantino proclaimed it would be too intense and we would be unable to watch his full film in one sitting because of it is as ludicrous as the scene itself.  It must be the P.T. Barnum in him working.  If there had been some interesting swordplay, it might have been redeemable, but because it is more important to Tarantino to have his blood joke, you actually see very little of the fighting mostly due to some of the worse editing ever seen in this type of film.  As if black and white weren't enough, shortly after we get the finish of the battle completely in shadows with the lights turned off.  More Tarantino cool. More pointlessness.When The Bride's fight with the already dead Lucy Liu does occur, our only curiosity is how she dispenses with her.  The scene is beautifully photographed, but the battle itself is so quick and anticlimactic we can only stare at the screen and go HUH?  Some decent one on one swordplay would have been nice here but I guess that doesn't fit in with Tarantino's scheme of putting as much blood out there as possible.  So much for paying actual homage to Samurai films.Tarantino could have done what he supposedly set out to do.  Between this half of the film and the second half we'll get in February, there may have been enough to make an hour and a half or two hour film homage to the genre he claims to love.  Unfortunately, his love of himself is becoming so overwhelming, his love of showing off his filmmaking coolness interferes too much with what this film could have been and should have been.  Will his faithful followers ever be convinced that this is an overextended, two part self congratulatory two part rip off? Probably not, but Tarantino knows that.  So did P.T. Barnum.",2,8,12,23 October 2003
The Last Samurai," Zwick, Cruise, Ken Watanabe and John Toll Give us an incredible experience
","Edward Zwick, the director who gave us the film Glory back in 1989, has in my opinion not quite been able to live up to his capabilities since  that film.  Films like Courage Under Fire and Legends of the Fall were good films but severely flawed at times.  Finally, as director of The Last Samurai, he has given us the film we've been waiting for from him for over ten long years.  Zwick along with writers John Logan and Marshall Herkovitz, have given us two extremely complex characters. Tom Cruise portrays Nathan Algren and Ken Watanabe portrays his adversary Katsumoto.  Cruise is one of those actors that seems never to get the credit that he deserves.  It is the same bit of silly business applied to Paul Newman for many years. His looks and stardom seemed to have deterred and distracted some film goers and critics from understanding the depth of his acting prowess for years. Much of the same can be said when some critics write now about Cruise.  With films on his resume such as Minority Reports, Vanilla Sky, Jerry Maguire and Born on the Fourth of July, Cruise has shown himself to be consistently an actor who is willing to not only take chances but to bring depth to all his roles.  As Nathan Algren he continues in that mold.  Algren is a man tormented by yet resigned to his profession.  He is continually haunted by visions of Indian women and children being slaughtered, yet we are never sure if he feels any particular remorse.  He uses alcohol to numb himself against the demons he is carrying yet he again sells his services as a mercenary to a Japanese country that is quickly modernizing itself.  His job is to help arm and train a Japanese army and assist them in wiping out a Samurai uprising.  In essence, the same thing he has always done and seems resigned to do till he meets his end.The leader of the Samurai is Katsumoto.  He is willing to fight to the death to uphold the traditions of the life he knows much in the same way the American Indians fought.  He fights for the emperor yet it is the emperor who will send an army out to destroy Katsumoto and his warriors.  When Algren is forced to lead his rag tag army into battle against the Samurai before they are obviously ready, his men are quickly defeated.  Algren, however, continues to battle to the very end.  Just before Algren is ready to be killed, Katsumoto impressed by the fierceness with which Algren fights, instead takes him prisoner so that he may understand his enemy.As they learn about each other, we too begin to understand the complexity of these two men and the paths they have chosen.   Ken Watanabe brings Katsumoto to life with such precision and depth, he is able to give us not only an understanding of the Samurai, but makes us admire a world totally different from our own and to sympathize with his cause. 
There is a love story in this film, but unlike most films it is played out beneath the surface.  We know it is there but it is never directly spoken of and simmers continually beneath the surface. Many a director would not have been able to resist the temptation to play this out as a full blown romance, but Zwick admirably keeps things in check thanks in large part to Koyuki. Koyuki plays Taka, in such a reserved quiet performance that we at no time can doubt her sincerity.  There are issues between Algren and Taka, but you'll have to see the film as I'm not one to give away every little plot development.If one wanted to take a lesson in how to stage and film a battle sequence Zwick gives it here.  Many battles in film today are stage and film with the emphasis being on confusion.  Zwick goes in the other direction and it pays great dividends.  John Toll, above all else, with New Zealand passing for Japan, has photographed a world of richness, beauty and grace that alone is worth the price of a movie ticket.If you are one of the many film goers who found it necessary to rush out to see Return of the King and having done that are looking for something else to view during the rest of the winter, you can't go wrong with this film.  I highly highly recommend it.My Grade: A+",10,1,2,13 January 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," Not just film, but film history
","The first time I saw To Kill A Mockingbird was at a drive-in theater.  I was probably about ten or eleven at the time.  Even at a young age I was captivated by this seemingly simple story told through the eyes of children that I could easily relate to.  Perhaps also it was the fact that the part of the story that dealt with Boo Radley, held a kind of mystery and an eeriness for me, much in the way a ghost story would.  I'm not about to make the pretense that I understood the social significance of To Kill A Mockingbird at the age of ten, or even the greatness of the film.  That would come later in life, after having viewed it in one of it's first network television broadcasts.One of the things that makes To Kill A Mockingbird a truly great film is the love and respect everyone involved in bringing Harper Lee's novel to the screen had for the original source material.  It shows up on screen in every single frame.  Each performance in this film is beyond reproach.  Gregory Peck had many fine performances over his storied career, but none every approached the perfection he brought to his portrayal of Atticus Finch.  As Atticus, Peck brings us the depth of understanding as to how his love for Jem and Scout enables him to treat his children with respect and honesty. He never talks down to them, but approaches them on a level in which children of their age can comprehend and learn from his own wisdom.  Yet, he is still able to retain the same no nonsense approach as other parents. Atticus is also a man who believes in the integrity of justice, yet recognizes the failings of our justice system.  When called upon to do his duty, he does so, despite the hatred and venom brought to bear upon him and his children by the citizens of the town in which he lives.In casting Jem, Scout and Dill, Producer Alan J. Pakula and Director Robert Mulligan faced a daunting task.  So much of the success of To Kill A Mockingbird depended on the pivotal role these characters would play in the film.  For Jem he chose Philip Alford, for Scout, Mary Badham, and for Dill, John Megna.  Alford and Badham were both southern natives who had never been in films before.  Megna was a New York native but was also inexperienced. It is this inexperience and lack of polish that enables all three to shine on the screen.  Mulligan began filming by letting them act as if making a film was like recess, allowing them to play on the set, and only moving the camera gradually as they became accustomed to their surroundings.  It paid off in every way imaginable.  None of the three ever appear as if they are actors acting, and bring a childlike wonder and presence to their roles that I had never seen before, and will unlikely witness again.Brock Peters as Tom Robinson, the black man falsely accused of raping a white girl, also gives a performance which he would never again surpass. You will not find anywhere a more memorable scene in any court room than when he testifies on the witness stand.  Because he dared to care about a white girl, he now faces almost certain death if convicted, and perhaps even if not convicted.  It is the first time I was able to begin to understand the effects of man's prejudice and hatred of a man simply because of the color of his skin.  Just as Jem and Scout came of age, and realized the significance of the injustices of racial hatred, so did I.Equally significant, is Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell. She makes it easy for many to hate her, but like Atticus, we see in her a person to be more pitied than hated.  She is a product of not only the times in which she lives, but even more so of her wretched upbringing.  Mayella is what she is, but only because of the deep cutting prejudices of those around her.  To Mayella, being caught enticing a black man into your house for relations, is the ultimate crime and the penalty for doing so is unthinkable to her.
In his screen debut as Boo Radley, Robert Duvall also brings to life the mysterious neighbor that once frightened Jem, Dill, and Scout so much. Though on the screen for a short length of time, without uttering a word, Duvall shows us a man tortured by years of cruelty, mistreatment, and the gossip and whispers of neighbors.  He is a man who wants only to live in his own way, yet the bond that links him to Jem and Scout is significant.  They are the childhood he had never really known.  Just as Tom Robinson, he has never brought harm to anyone, yet suffers significantly just for the right to be able to exist.The care with which To Kill A Mockingbird was brought to the screen can also be seen in the Art Direction by Henry Bumstead and Set Decoration by Oliver Emert.  They indeed bring to life what a small Southern Town would have been like in the early thirties. Cinematographer Russel Harlan's black and white photography brings it all vividly to the screen, especially in the way he captures the foreboding of the Radley house, the moments when Bob Ewell approaches Jem when he is left in a car alone, and even more noteworthy near the end of the film when Jem and Scout are walking home from a school play. Elmer Bernstein's score is never boisterous, but yet is as important to setting the mood of many of the scenes played out before us.There have been many eloquent words written in many of the comments on this board about To Kill A Mockingbird. Many of the words are far better than those that I have written.  Then again, maybe a few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement in film making that To Kill A Mockingbird is.  It will be forever remembered, long after you and I have departed from this world.  It is at this point that I usually grade a film. I will skip that here, simply because there is no grade that I can give that could possibly do justice for To Kill A Mockingbird.",10,196,214,1 April 2004
Jaws," A film that has been etched in my memory since the first time I saw it a two thirty in the morning at a cinema
","It has been almost twenty-nine years since producers Richard D. Zanuck and director Stephen Spielberg unleashed Jaws onto the big screen and into film history.  In 1975, the summer blockbuster was born, for better or as many now believe, or for worse.  Whatever your feelings are on that subject doesn't matter.  Jaws is still one heckuva ride.In 1971 Spielberg directed a movie of the week for ABC entitled Duel.  It was the story of one man confronting a relentless enemy.  In that film, the enemy was a huge tractor trailer rig.  We never saw the drive of the truck, all we saw was his relentless, single minded goal to pummel and kill Dennis Weaver as the everyman.  It was one of the best of the Movie of the week films, but little did anyone know that it would eventually lead Spielberg to Jaws, which would put his name on the map permanently.  Just as the truck in Duel was of a single minded purpose, so is the shark in Bruce.  As Richard Dreyfuss puts it, the only thing a shark does is swim, eat, and make baby sharks.  In Jaws, it mostly swims and eat, with tourists and citizens of Amity being it's main course.  The original idea was to use a mechanical shark in the filming of Jaws.  The fact that the never before tested shark didn't work as planned turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to Spielberg in jaws.  It forced him to rely more on his capabilities as a storyteller and director by shooting much of the film from the perspective of the shark.  Yet, Spielberg is so astute at using this device, and aided by the editing of Verna Fields, after seeing the film, you'll swear you saw the shark more than you actually did.  If any person besides Spielberg deserved an Oscar for Jaws it was Verna Fields who went on to score a win in the category.  There is no explanation for the lack of so much as a directorial nomination for Spielberg.  Bill Butler's cinematography deserves special mention as well, especially when the action switches from Amity Island to the Orca and the open sea.  As for John Williams score it is the stuff legends are made of. The thought of Jaws without William's simple shark theme is unfathomable.As for the cast, they too are perfect in roles now ingrained in our memory. Though they have made other fine and notable films, one cannot think of Scheider, Dreyfuss, Shaw, Hamilton or Laraine Gary without thinking of this film.  Maybe it was luck that brought this cast together, or like just about anything else associated with Jaws, the casting was perhaps one of those things that was just meant to be.  Dreyfuss's Hooper provides the perfect foil for Shaw's Quint.  Quint is hard edge and sea worn, Hooper is a product of luxury and class.  Scheider's Chief Brody is like the dependable anchor, who keeps everyone in their place.  I was really happy to see Murray Hamilton as the Mayor.  He is perfect for the role, as evidenced by a conversation he has with Hooper and Brodie as they try to convince him the shark is still a threat.  We know his arguments and defense of his position are foolish, but as Mayor Vaughn Hamilton gives the lines almost a comedic edge.   If you have ever had the privilege of seeing Jaws in a movie theater, I can't think of too many films that had as terrifying and an attention grabbing opening as Jaws.  Because of these first few minutes as the shark suddenly attacks Chrissie without warning, Spielberg grabs hold of his audience and never lets them loose for the entire running time of the film. The fact that the last forty five minutes or so of the film take place aboard Quint's small boat the Orca, yet never loses it momentum during the entire sequence is again a testimony to Spielberg's directorial brilliance.If ever there has been a perfect suspense/action/horror film made it has to be Jaws.  It is a film that has been etched in my memory since the first time I saw it at two thirty in the morning in a cinema in downtown Cincinnati.  We had bought tickets at five in the afternoon to get into that two thirty a.m. showing.  I was thinking at the time it had better be one heck of a film if I was to be able to stay awake into the wee hours of the morning.  I needn't have worried about that.  For causing me one night's good sleep, and for being all around excellent you get my grade.  It's an A+.  Was there any doubt in your mind?",10,3,7,15 March 2004
The Terminal," Entertaining throughout, but doesn't add up to much
","Having been around a few airport terminals in my time, I can safely say that it's a place that I only visit out of necessity, and sure is hell would never think of living in one.  I've been lucky enough not to have been stuck interminably in between flights or delayed more than a few hours, and will be eternally grateful to the powers that be for that.  I can't imagine having to spend a whole day in an airport, and the thought of having to take up residence in one for several days is almost as abhorrent to me as the thought of having to clean out a construction site porta-pot. 
In The Terminal, our mythical hero Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from the mythical land of Krakozia lands in the not so mythical J.F.K. airport. While Viktor was in the air, getting from there to here, Krakozia undergoes a coup.  Because of this, Viktor technically has no country to return to, and since the U.S. doesn't recognize the new mythical regime, his passport and visa are no longer valid and are confiscated by mythical security chief Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who then tells Viktor he can't leave the airport and enter New York City and must not leave the International Arrivals Lounge.  Of course Frank expects Viktor to do what just about anyone else would and leave anyway, but Viktor does as he is told and stays at the airport, and stays and stays and stays and stays and stays etc.  It doesn't help matters that Viktor doesn't understand but a few words of English, that his money is no longer any good, and that it takes him about five minutes to lose all of his food vouchers.  I think it's called having your back up against the wall.Viktor finally makes a few friends at the airport including a janitor, a food service worker, an INS agent who stamps his permission to leave with a big red declined every day, and develops a crush on the beautiful Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an airline hostess having an affair with a married guy (Michael Nouri).  How Viktor copes and learns to live is kind of sweet, often funny, and sometimes sad.  The fact that we buy any of this at all can be laid squarely on the shoulders of Tom Hanks who gives a remarkable performance as Viktor.  Not only does his accent stay consisted, his broken English never falters one bit as he learns phrases by comparing his Krakozia tour book to the exact same one written in English.  He keeps Viktor consistent throughout, a simple man whose one desire is to be able to enter New York to fulfill a promise kept in a peanut can he carries from place to place.  Viktor is the kind of person Frank Dixon doesn't understand, can't understand, and yet in some small way perhaps envies him because he is able to relate to people in ways that Frank will never be able to.Of course much of what happens in The Terminal is far-fetched (although supposedly loosely based on a true story) but since this is fairy-tale land I guess it's supposed to be.  Viktor acts as a go between in helping develop a relationship between the INS agent Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) and the food service worker Enrique (Diego Luna), both of whom end up being devout trekkies.  Relationships have been built on less though as witnessed by Amelia who has been hanging out with the married guy for several years waiting for him to leave his wife.  As Viktor develops his own relationship with her, it is both touching and sweet, and we root for them.  Viktor eventually does find a job at the airport in a sequence that seems written more out of convenience for the plot than any other reason.Credit also has to be given to the writers and Spielberg for being able to pace a two hour film that takes place in an airport terminal in just the right way so that it is interesting and seldom bogs down.  I never felt like it was two hours which is saying quite a bit when you think of what two hours at the airport really feels like. There are some truly warm and fuzzy moments in The Terminal, some pretty good laughs, a few good enough if not spectacular performances by the cast (other than Hanks who is excellent), and several entertaining characters. Yet when it is over, you'll still leave the theater asking, `So what?'  A lot of the reason for this is that we get an ending you'll find only partially satisfying.  Some may quibble that if Spielberg had given us everything we wanted, than it wouldn't have been true to the story or the characters.  In answer to that I can only say hey, if you're going to give us two hours of what is basically a modern day fairy tale, you can at least give your audience what you know they want to see.  If a totally satisfying ending is good enough for Mother Goose, it should be fine for Spielberg's fairy tale as well.  I still may have left saying, `So what?' but I would have felt better about asking the question.  All in all, it's an entertaining enough way to spend two hours, but it's just one of those films that in the end isn't memorable enough to make it worth a trip to a theater, yet is good enough that you would probably want to watch it on DVD in the comfort of your living room at some point in time.   And if the only thing I can recommend is that people see your film on DVD, I have no choice but to give you my grade and for The Terminal that's a B-.",7,1,3,26 July 2004
Back to the Future Part II," From the present, to the future, back to the present, then back to the past. One great ride!
","When Back to The Future was initially conceived, director and writer Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale had no idea how much notoriety it would eventually achieve, nor of the big box office records it would break.  They were happy just to see their project come to fruition. When they wrote the original film, the ending they had written was supposed to be the end of it. Because of it's success, however, and Hollywood being Hollywood, there had to be the inevitable sequels.  The problem was that with the original ending, they had painted themselves into a corner as to where they could go with the sequel.  What they finally came up with in Part II, is a film that is every bit as whimsical as the original, yet moves along at a pace that will leave you breathless. For part II the cast is pretty much intact from the original film.  The exceptions are Crispin Glover as George McFly has been replaced by Jeffrey Weisman and Claudia Wells has been replaced by Elizabeth Shue as Marty's girlfriend Jennifer.  George McFly's role in the sequel is more talked about by other characters than his actual on screen time, and Jennifer's time on screen is quick and brief also (although she has one great scene that takes place in the future)so neither casting change is of any consequence. The original film dealt with how Marty had threatened his own existence because of changes he had accidentally initiated in the year 1955.  For Part II, we learn what happens when the interference is of a much larger scale and consequence. As you recall, the original film ended with Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)whisking Marty (Michael J. Fox)and Jennifer away with him to the year 2015 to straighten out their kids.  For all his harping about messing with historical events, Doc is not above initiating a bit of interference himself.  In their attempt to rescue Marty's future offspring, an aged but still obnoxious Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), steals the Delorean to transport himself into the past and to bestow upon himself a Sports Almanac book that contains the results of sporting events for years to come.  Shortly thereafter, Doc and Marty return to 1985, only to find that not only is Hill Valley not what it used to be, their own lives are in pretty sad shape and far different than what they had been before.  And the changes aren't good ones, or as Doc puts it 'I can't imagine Hell being much worse.' What makes the Back To The Future series so terrific, is that Zemeckis and Gale took the time travel concept, applied a little originality to it, then let their imaginations run wild. In BTTFII, we get a story that moves along like a runaway freight train.  Not content to give us what the year 2015 may be truly like, since making such predictions are usually wrong anyway, they decide to let it all hang loose and just have fun with it.  There are holographic theaters, Cafe 80's shops, antique stores that sell dustbusters and other things, skateboards that hover, paying for cab rides with thumbprints, etc. etc.  Yet, for all the glossy, multi-colored stores and goofy concepts, we still recognize it as the same old Hill Valley. Something else Zemeckis and Gale do is to take some events from the first film, and replay them in 2015 Hill Valley.  Usually, things like this would be seen as the lack of an idea, but in this case its simply Zemeckis having a little fun and letting us in on it.  It works perfectly. Likewise, the alternative version of 1985 Hill Valley is an exercise in how far one's imagination can go.  Instead of a quaint peaceful town and suburbs, Zemeckis and Gale do everything in their power to give us the equivalent of an opposite. To go into too much detail here would undermine your own viewing experience and give away a bit too much of the plot. Then to add fuel to the fire, we once again revisit Hill Valley in 1955, where things really go berserk what with two Marty's and two Docs inhabiting the same year.  Zemeckis does a great job of cutting new scenes into footage from the original film with different angles and different perspectives of previous seen activities. As for the cast, Fox and Lloyd keep their characters of Marty and Doc on the same entertaining level as before.  Fox is also given the chore of playing his nerdy son of the future, Marty as a middle aged man and even his daughter of the future.  He is pretty much successful except I do think playing his daughter was a bit much.  Lea Thompson, again has the difficult chore of bringing Lorraine Mcfly to us in three different characterizations, and as before handles it admirably.  Her 1955 Lorraine will always be her most memorable characterization in these films, but the others are equally well done.  As for Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, Biff is biff, no matter how old, how young, or how powerful he may be, and his consistence of performance is also noteworthy. Some have complained about being able to follow Zemeckis and Gale's storyline.  If you have seen the first film, you'll have no trouble in that regard.  I sure didn't, and for me it was one heck of a comedic thrill ride from beginning to end.  If you don't have fun watching Back To The Part II, then the only thing I can think of is that your as much of a curmudgeon as old Biff from 2015.  It's not often that a sequel can live up to it's predecessor, but when it does, and introduces some originality along the way you get my grade, which for Back To The Future is an A.",10,89,106,21 March 2004
A Walk to Remember," 'Surprise, Surprise! Movie I was sure I would hate, I loved'
","There have been so many films made about teenage romance where we get the usual bland cliches and stock characters(boy from wrong side of tracks falls for nice girl or vice versa), that I had sincere doubtsabout even watching this film.  One of the greatest joys in moviewatching is finding a film you are sure you will hate, and discovering a true gem.  A Walk To Remember is just such a movie.  Sincere, honest, portrayals by Shane West and Mandy Moore elevate this film to a level where most movies of this type only dream of reaching.  Not only is this a story of romance, it's a story of finding those things in life that are most important to us, and experiencing them to thefullest while we can.  Excellent performances, a great script that remains true to it's characters throughout and avoids the usual cliches and stereotypes the would certainly doom such a venture as this.  If you're looking for an emotional ride, get out the handkerchiefs and enjoy! and watch this one!",9,0,0,25 March 2003
Back to the Future," Tell me, doctor, where are we going this time?
","Good time travel films have always held a certain amount of fascination for me despite the improbability and implausible concept involved. Traveling through time is one of those 'what if' fantasies one can continually dwell. I never grow tired of considering the endless possibilities involved if such thing were possible. I especially enjoy when a film gives us a new and entertaining twist on the subject. With Back To The Future, director and writer Robert Zemeckis along with writer Bob Gale has given us not only one of the best of the genre, but began one of the truly great film trilogies.If you don't know the story by now, Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) is a teenager with more than his share of problems. His father, George(Crispin Glover) gives new definition to the meaning of the word dork, his mother Lorraine(Lea Thompson) is a worn out closet alcoholic, his brother Dave (Marc McClure) works at a fast food joint, and his sister Linda(Wendie Jo Sperber) is on the verge of becoming an old maid. Outside of the home, a teacher named Strickland(James Tolkan) has it in for Marty constantly referring to him a slacker and his father's co-worker, Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is constantly intimidating George even to the point of having George doing his work assignments for him. Marty's best friend is an old scientist named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and his girlfriend is Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). It is his relationships with Jennifer and Doc Brown that enable Marty to think he might somehow escape the trials and tribulations of his Daily life. Well, Marty does escape, but not a manner that he could not have imagined in his worst nightmare. It seems that Doc Brown has invented a time machine out of a Delorean and through a series of misadventures Marty gets transported back to his home town in the year 1955. Not only does Marty meet his parents and his Dad's arch enemy Biff as teenagers, he somehow manages to interfere with Lorraine and George's romance, thus jeopardizing his own existence. It is left up to the Doc Brown of the past to help Marty set things right, and somehow find a way to return Marty 'Back To The Future.'This scenario sets up endless possibilities and Zemeckis and Gale make full use of the concept. Not only do they have Marty interfering with his parents relationship, but his mother develops a crush on him in one of the most hilarious romantic encounters one could imagine. The more Marty tries to set things right, the more Lorraine becomes infatuated with him. Don't worry, Zemeckis and Gale never let the idea sink into sleaziness, but instead develop it into one hilarious moment after another. What is amazing also is watching how the life of the teenage Lorraine is as different from the adult Mrs. Mcfly as night and day. It's a revelation to Marty and to us. As for George, it seems he has always been somewhat of a cowardly type, but as Marty discovers, he had hopes and dreams as a teenager much as many of us did.Michael J. Fox was the perfect choice to play Marty McFly. Initially, because of his TV series commitment, he had to take a pass. When Eric Stoltz was not working out as Marty, Fox was thankfully able to work things out to be able to do the film. For that we shall forever be grateful. It's not that I think Eric Stoltz is not a good actor, but his laid back and darker personality would never have fit into what Marty was. Christopher Lloyd brings a characterization to Doc Brown that makes him the glue that holds the idea of time travel together. He's crazy enough to come up with the idea of a DeLorean Time Machine and has us believe he could make good on the concept. His friendship with Marty is believable enough that their on screen moments together seem genuine and sincere. There is no other way to put it except to say that if there is one character in this movie stranger than Doc, it's Crispin Glover's George. His portrayal gives new meaning to the words wimpy coward. Lea Thompson as Lorraine sets the pace for everyone. Her future Lorraine is different in so many aspects from the teenage Lorraine, yet Ms. Thompson is able to pull it off without a hitch and still have us believe they are one and the same person. There is nothing lovable about Thomas Wilson's biff. He is the consummate high school bully that many of us dealt with on more than one occasion. We have to admit a great satisfaction in how his character is dealt with.Of course, as I have mentioned in other films about time travel, all this good stuff could have been wasted if the film makers had copped out at the end. It's the kind of thing that has ruined many other films of the genre. Zemeckis and Gale not only do not hesitate in their assumptions of the possibilities of what happens when you interfere with the past, they take the ball and run with it making the film just that much more satisfying.If you were to look at a list of my favorite films, you would see Back To The Future on there, occupying a place of prominence. It is in the top 250 films on the IMDB, and one of the films that earned its place justifiably so. And if you are on my personal list, and that list also, you get my grade and in this case it equals an A+.",10,1,2,18 March 2004
