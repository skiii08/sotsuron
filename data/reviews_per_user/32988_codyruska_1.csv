Hereditary," Gruesome yes, horror NO!
","This is a poor excuse for a horror film, every event that may have been scary is destroyed by its lead in, because of this I knew everything thing that was going to happen before it occurred. Removing any true shock value.
A car speeding at 80mph and the rear passenger puts there head out the window, have a guess what happens 30 seconds later.If you you want your kids to have nightmares about fat naked grey people, take them along with you. This is my first review, I felt true horror fans needed to know the advertising was just hype. Another film where the best of it is edited to make an awesome trailer.",1,3,8,17 October 2018
