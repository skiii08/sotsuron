Conquest 1453," Low quality, propaganda flick
","This is part of the Turkish ambition to spread their cultural goods to third countries, like it's been happening with TV series. Also, it smacks of ethnic pride. As such I wouldn't expect much -and I didn't, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. You see, there are propaganda flicks that are nice to watch; there are also silly films that are fun to watch. But, combine the too and you'd better leave it alone.Three basic problems with this movie: -too long (well, a story of this size could be twice as big but the focus -or lack thereof- of the movie is such that by the time it ends you want to go to bed) -too historically inaccurate, full of fairy tales and so one-sided -really silly cinematography and special FX.What a waste...",1,2,7,18 February 2013
