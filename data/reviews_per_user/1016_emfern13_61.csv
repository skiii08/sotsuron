Vertigo," Great!!!
","I had not seen Vertigo for 7 years until today. When I fist saw it I thought it was good but nothing Great. Now I watched it again and I think its Great. Absolutely Great. I love the sets, the music, and the performances. Direction by Hitchcock is top notch. But i dont think this is his #1 movie. I think that belongs to Psycho. Overall, 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,30 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Very Underrated Movie
","This movie is extremely underrated. I mean I know its not perfect but its not that flawed. The acting ranges from fair to good. Liam Neeson, Ray Park, and Ewan Mcgregor were good. Jake Lloyd was sometimes good and sometimes annoying, but this was the first little kid ever in a Star Wars movie, give him some credit. Natalie Portman gives an ok performance. The script has a few problems. The dialogue is flat in areas.However, this movie does not lack action. Theres plenty of action with state of the art visual effects. In my opinion, I like Star Wars and the Phantom Menace are about the same. Star Wars was a little slow in areas. Phantom Menace was not slow at all. Some people complain that there is too many visual effects, but the last Star Wars movies had really fake effects. So far I think that Episode I and II are better than IV and V. My rating for Episode I and star Wars are about the same. But I like Clones better than Empire. Only because Empire was so boring. I think Episode I is better than II, because that love story was pretty bad, but I really liked II. I liked the Third one the best out of the original trilogy. If Episode III is not good at all, than i will like the original trilogy better.",10,1,2,27 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just Awesome
","I know this movie has been hated by lots of peopple, including some of the cast but i think otherwise. I loved this movie and cannot wait for Attack of the Clones. I will be seeing that movie soon. I think this is George Lucas's greatest creation. Awesome Visual Effects, like the Podrace scene, Coruscant, and Otoh Gunga (Gungan City).I like the other Star Wars movies too. Return of the Jedi is the best one out of those. A New Hope is the next one, which is a little but still good. Empire strikes back is good at the beginning and the end but in the middle it sucks. Episode I is the best one.",10,1,2,11 May 2002
Ali," I noticed alot of people were disappointed in this movie
","I was not disappointed, especially with Will Smiths performance it was a big change for him and he did it well. Jon Voight really shined as Howard Cousell, he gave a flawless performance no wonder he was nominated. Now this movie does have some flaws. The Script is a bit uneven in parts. What i mean is that in the parts with Malcolm X and Ali there was a little bit too much of Malcolm X. I mean was it really necessary for him to be in the picture for that long. The other flaw is the movie runs a bit on the long side at 2 1/2 hours but it doesnt really get boring. The fight scenes were impressive and so were the locations. Overall, a 9 out of 10 but it sort of pales in comparison to Raging Bull.",9,0,0,26 February 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Ties With Two Towers As The 2nd Best Movie of 2002
","I know there both very different but Catch Me If You Can needs to be ranked this high. It is richly entertaining and in its 140 minute running time, it doesn't get boring. Unlike Dicaprio's other movie Gangs of New York gets boring after awhile.Also unlike in Gangs of New York Dicaprio gives an excellent performance in Catch Me If You Can and in Gangs he gives a terrible performance. It's really sad that Dicaprio will probably not be nominated for an oscar because this is by far his best performance. Theres just too much competition for him. Tom Hanks did a good job too but he wont be nominated either.This movie has an excellent script, that should at least be nominated for an Oscar. So should the Original Score. The Costume Design and Art direction are possible too. Spielbergs Direction is a longshot for an oscar nomination but its not totally impossible. Best Picture is totally impossible though, sadly.",10,1,2,25 January 2003
The Ring," Very Well Done for the most part
","For the most part this movie is very well done. Its extremely creepy in the beginning and towards the end is also extremely creepy. The acting isn't bad, Naomi Watts could have been a little bit better but she was good, the kid was creepy but at times I thought at times he was trying to be like Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense. The script was also underwritten in areas, not much but a little bit. In the end the movie doesn't end up making alot of sense. You still don't know who made the tape, but that might be explained in a sequel or a prequel. Overall, a very creepy movie that kept me entertained all the way and in my opinion one of the best movies of 2002.",10,1,1,27 February 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Well.......
","Well it was not horrible. Lucas came up with the story which is an ok story but like  Star Wars, Raiders proved to be even slower. There were some parts that were visually amazing. Spielberg did an excellent jobDirecting. The movie had a decent script with some funny scenes, but the script is not as funny as some scenes are in Star WArs. Overall, this is a worth watching movie, but in my opinion is the weakest in the trilogy.",7,0,2,11 June 2002
Minority Report," One of Spielbergs Greatest
","This is one of Spielbergs greatest, If not his greatest movie. My favorite of his movies are this one, the first two Jurassic Parks, and A.I., which is only boring if you cant stand that type of movie. Minority Report is better than A.I. for one reason, its much less of a depressing movie. Like A.I., Minority Report is tended for teenagers and Adults. This movie has a brilliant plot and fantastic visual effects. Steven Spielberg isn't starting to lose his touch like George Lucas is beginning to.",10,0,0,23 September 2002
Unbreakable," WOW
","Unbreakable is one hell of a movie. Shyamalan can make movies. In this movie he proved that the 6th sense was no fluke, which i think was screwed out of best picture. Unbreakable is based entirely on a comic book which is very clever. The ending was a big shocker, about as shocking as the 6th sense's. Great Performances too. It is not as good as the 6th sense but it is very good.",9,0,0,15 April 2002
As Good as It Gets," A Great Script plus Great Acting Makes This a Great Movie
","This is a great movie. It had a very funny script and the acting was spectacular. Jack Nicholson definitely deserved his third Oscar for this, he was funny and added the right to his character. Helen Hunt also deserved her Oscar she was excellent and also funny. Greg Kinnear was pretty good also, he deserved his nomination. I give this movie a 9 out of 10, I would give it a 10 its just that I could never give a romantic comedy a 10.",9,1,1,18 February 2003
The Terminator," An Average Movie
",This movie is just ok. Its not James Cameron's best effort but its not his worst. His worst is by far Titanic. Arnold Schwarzenneger is definitely not a good bad guy. He is just awful as a bad Terminator. This movie is sometimes boring but there is a really awesome scene at the end of the movie.,7,1,7,26 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Second Best
","Return of the Jedi seemed to be much of an improvement over the Empire Strikes Back, which had some problems in my opinion. This movie displays effects just as good as a New Hope, but not as good as the two prequels. The acting was exceptional in this one. Harrison Ford was probably happy that he did not have to do these anymore. The action was really good in this too. 10/10",10,1,3,25 May 2002
Taxi Driver," Fantasticly Scary
","These would be the two words I would use describe Robert De Niro's chilling performance as the mentally disturbed taxi driver, Travis Bickle. De Niro is in top form in his performance. Maybe his best role ever (tied with Raging Bull). Jodie Foster gives a very good performance as the child prostitute, Iris. They were both nominated for Oscars and De Niro should have won.Other things in the movie that make it perfect is Paul Schraders Original Screenplay. The Script delivers unforgettable lines like ' You Talkin To Me.' One of the most memorable movie quotes ever. Martin Scorsese's direction is top notch in every way. Why the f*** wasn't he nominated? Overall, a pretty much perfect movie; 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,29 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Awesome Visual Effects. but Some of the acting Is Far Less Than Awesome
","I just saw Attack of the Clones. I was impressed at how much better the visual effects were in this one than in Episode I. The Best scene is the chase scene. I will not give away anymore. The movie was just visually amazing. The movie did have its problems. Anakin was a whiny asshole in that movie. He was not the cute talented little boy anymore, he was a whiner. Hayden Christiansen really did not portray the role very well. I hope he is better in Episode III. Count Dooku was not a very scary villain. He was not the horrifying Darth Maul in Episode I.The movies title was questionable too. The Clones did not do much of attacking in the movie. All they did was attack at the end. Maybe more attacking will occur in Episode III. This movie was really awesome but was not the best in the series. It was better than the Empire Strikes back, which i did not care for. The best is Episode I. THen comes Return of the Jedi, New hope, Attack of the clones, and Empire strikes back.",9,0,0,24 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Visually Amazing
","I saw this movie last night and it was so close to selling out. There were two seats left in the front. This movie was just awesome. The visual effects were much better in this than in Episode I. George Lucas made sure that this had great effects.This movie does have some problems. Like Count Dooku was not very scary for a villain, unlike the horrifying Darth Maul. Anakin mostly whined throughout the movie, but he got better later on in the movie. I do think Hayden Christiansen was a poor choice to play Anakin or maybe it was the lame lines that Anakin said in the script. However, one villain manage to change the Count Dooku thing, and his name is Jango Fett. Fett was a really good villain and his son, boba, was mean also. But he does not compare to the horrifying Darth Maul. The movie actually seemed to be much faster than the other one. I had problems remembering things.Overall, the movie was a thumbs up and definitely worth seeing. It is also worth buying on Dvd. Episode I will always be my favorite. This one had better effects but Episode I had a better story and in my opinion better acting. It has some of my favorite scenes like the underwater scene and the podracing scene. There were no underwater scenes in this movie, which disappointed me. Yoda was really good in the movie. Besides Episode I the rest of my order: Return of the Jedi, New Hope, Attack of the Clones, and Empire Strikes Back. This movie deserves a 9/10.",9,0,0,25 May 2002
Forrest Gump," OVERRATED
","Dont get me wrong this is a good movie but it is way overrated. Sure, it has Great performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise but It just didnt do as much for me as it did for other people. It has a pretty good script and pretty well directed but the movie is too long and can get a little boring. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10. Its a good movie, just not one of my favorites.",8,2,5,19 February 2003
The Godfather: Part II," You can't say its better than Godfather I, but you can say its just as Great
","In my opinion, Godfather II is not better than Godfather I but its just as great. These two movies are the best Crime Dramas Ever Made. The acting is top notch, just like in the first movie. Al Pacino delivers an awesome performance. Talia Shire also delivers a good performance but I wish she was in it a little more. Robert Deniro stole the movie with his performance as the young Vito Corleone. No wonder he won best supporting actor. Diane Keaton's performance is actually better in this movie than the last one.The movie's Directing is actually done better than in Part I. Another brilliant script was in this movie. Has more great lines that many people remember today. The two stories helped this movie I think. Even though the movie was a bit longer than Part I you really dont care when you see how well done the two stories were. I think if there was only one story the movie wouldn't have been as great. The first two Godfathers will always remain the Best Crime Drama Movies around. Thats another promise.",10,0,1,22 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not Good
","This movie just doesn't cut it for me. I know it got so many good reviews, but it was just too long and too boring. The acting in it was horrible, except for Ian McKellen as Gandalf. The movie had good Cinematography but didn't deserve to win. I agree out of the three choices this deserved make up. It did not deserve the nomination for best picture or director, it did not even compare with the brilliant 'A Beautiful Mind.' The movie was overloaded with visual effects and did not deserve that award. A.I. had much better effects and deserved the award. Harry Potter had much better effects and did not even get nominated.",6,0,0,12 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I overeacted
","I admit I have overeacted on saying that this is a bad film. It is overrated, I'm still saying that. Its average but The Two Tower reigns supreme over it. I might watch it again for the 2nd time and see if my opinion changes. Ian Mckellens performance is excellent in this though.",6,1,2,26 January 2003
The Shining," One of the Best Horror Films Ever Made
","I really loved this movie but alot of people have mixed feelings towards it. Thats ok I dont care. I really enjoyed it.Now Im not saying its a perfect movie, there are some flaws in it. The big flaw in it is Shelley Duvall who really overacts at times. But I really liked Jack Nicholson's performance in it. Its masterfully shot by Stanley Kubrick. How could he get a Worst Director nomination for this? I also like the sets too. The Shining has kind of an eerie, haunting mood to it, and I like that. Overall, 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,29 March 2003
American Beauty," Ive raised it to 10/10
","I rated this movie 9/10 but now I have to change it to 10/10. Its a great movie, I love everything about this movie. Kevin Spacey is excellent, as is Annette Benning. Chris Cooper deserve a nomiination though. He was screwed by the academy. The Original Script is fantastic. Sam Mendes direction is nearly flawless.",10,0,0,27 March 2003
American Beauty," Sam Mendes Masterpiece
","American Beauty is a Great Movie. It is well directed by Sam Mendes who really deserved his Oscar. Kevin Spacey gave an Excellent performance and also deserved his Oscar. This movie deserved its Best Picture Oscar and definitely deserved Best Original Screenplay. The Supporting Cast all gave great performances, especially Chris Cooper who should have been nominated for an oscar.I am making a prediction about Sam Mendes. This will be his all time Masterpiece. Now I have not seen Road To Perdition and Sam Mendes probably has a long career a head of him but I think this will be his masterpiece.",10,0,0,20 February 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Best for Both Sides
",What the Title of this review means is its James Cameron's best movie and Arnold Schwarzenneger. This movie is a huge improvement over the mediocre Terminator. All the performances in the movie are really good. Arnold Schwarzenneger is a great good terminator. The Visual Effects in this movie are awesome for a movie of the early 90s. All I can say is bring on T3.,10,2,2,26 October 2002
The Fast and the Furious," The Best Car Movie Ever Made And The Third Best Summer Movie Of 2001
","This is by far the best car movie ever made. Before this, I thought Gone in 60 seconds was the best car movie. Just by the preview I knew this would be better and it was. There are more cars in 60 Seconds but theres more action, better plot and much better acting. If they put Nicholas Cage in this movie he would have ruined it. I mean he wasn't good in 60 seconds at all. Vin Diesel was the man for the job and he got the job done. Im a little disappointed that he won't be back for the sequel. He chose Pitch Black over Fast and the Furious. Pitch Black sucks. XXX is awesome but not as good as this.",10,0,2,26 October 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Why Didn't this get an oscars?
","This movie deserved many oscars. It had an excellent cast, beautiful acting, a great script and all in all a great movie. Probably going to become a classic in the near future. This is Steven Soderbergs greatest movie. It is a brilliant film and should have at least gotten 10 golden globes, if not any oscars.",10,0,0,29 September 2002
Pearl Harbor," I Overrated It
","When I first saw it I loved it. But now I have watched it again a couple of times and noticed some of the flaws. I have noticed Ben Afflecks performance sucks ass, the Script could have been better, and it is a bit long. Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale arent bad but they would have been better if the script was better. Its still an entertaining movie with a great battle scene but it could have been better.",8,0,1,15 March 2003
Pearl Harbor," An Epic
","Pearl Harbor is most definitely the Epic drama of 2001. Spectacular effects and great acting. Many people think the love story in this movie made this movie look terrible. It did not, I mean they could have shortened by like twenty minutes but the effects were spectacular and it should get nominated for several oscars.",8,0,1,7 December 2001
Resident Evil," Awesome
",Resident Evil is awesome. It is the best adaption of a video game to a movie. It is better than Tomb Raider. It doesn't have as many visual effects but it is still better. Milla Jovovich and Angie are really good action heroes but i think Milla is just a little better because she is a newer character. The script for RE is a little better than Tomb Raiders but neither one of them is very good. Resident Evil is an awesome well thoughtout movie.,10,0,0,22 August 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Its an Excellent movie, but a tad overrated
","No doubt this movie is great. Steven Spielberg directs this movie masterfully, absolutely flawless. There are good performances from the entire cast. But my main criticism is why Tom Hanks got an Oscar nomination? He was good but not worth an Oscar nomination (maybe I should watch the movie again). Its a great movie but I wonder if people rave about it too much. Overall, 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,29 March 2003
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Best movie of 1997
",This is truly the best film of 1997. In my opinion I think it is a lot better than the other two. It has more dinosaurs and more action than the others. The first one is awesome but its a little boring. The third one was the biggest mistake since Wild Wild West. The Lost World is number 9 on my top 100 list.,9,13,18,26 October 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Changed my opinion
","I have changed my mind this is not the best movie of 1997, not even close. I really enjoyed this movie alot though. The Special Effects were great and the action scenes were very well done. The Ending is probably the lowpoint but I dont hate it. I think its just as Good as the first one but both of them have their flaws.",9,9,12,5 April 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Its A Good Movie But.....
","I think it is very overrated. It has beautiful Cinematography, nice sets, and pretty decent looking costumes. But why is this movie ranked very high? I liked it Im not saying I didnt, the performances are pretty good from all the actors. But people think this should have won Best Picture and I dont see why. I give an 8 out of 10; It's visually Impressive but I was just expecting more.",8,0,1,19 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The 2nd Best Movie Of 2002
","When I saw the Fellowship of the Ring, I was disappointed because of all the hype and I didnt think it lived up to the hype. I overeacted and said that it was bad but it isnt its just very overrated. So I had mixed feelings about seeing The Two Towers, but after I saw it I thought it was a huge improvement over the Fellowship. Now I have never read the books I just think these movies look really interesting.The Two Towers still has excellent visual effects (like Fellowship did) and they put them to good measure in the movie. The Battle of Helms Deep was brilliantly directed and was probably the best battle in a fantasy movie. The other Battles were well shot, I really like the one at Isengrad with the trees vs. The Orcs. They also used their special effects to create Gollum who is by far the best CGI character ever made. The academy should make an exception and nominate him, he definitely deserves it. This will definitely win an Oscar for Visual Effects.I think everything else in the movie was excellent, the Art direction, Cinematography and Costume are top notch. The Screenplay was much better too. I think it will get a Best Picture and Best Director, but sadly it wont win. But there is another that will most likely win and its the only film to come in front of it this year.",10,0,0,25 January 2003
Driven," Great Action, but terrible acting
","Driven is filled with excellent action, im talking about the chases scenes and the crashes. Sly sucks major ass and he is regarded as the supporting actor. The best car movies are Gone in 60 Seconds and Fast and the furious. Furious rules over seconds because it has better action and a much better story and the acting in it is better than 60 seconds.",5,0,1,19 May 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Has a flew flaws, but still very good
","Moulin Rouge is a beautiful, pretty well done movie. The Sets, Cinematography, and Costumes are fantastic. Its an Original idea and performed pretty well. The only problem I have with it is that it is overdone in a few areas, like the talking moon is so ridiculously stupid. The Editing is another small problem, the movie moves way too fast in areas.With the flaws aside the movie is acted very well. Nicole Kidman is actually Fantastic, Her singing is good, her acting is great. Jim Broadbent was very good in both acting and singing. Ewan McGregor is pretty good in both areas. John Leguiziamo annoyed me alot.Overall 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,15 April 2003
Men in Black II," Worst of the Summer
","There is no doubt that MIIB is the worst movie of the summer. Its not awful but it really sucks compared to the last one. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones dont have very good chemistry and neither one of them were funny. Lara Flynn Boyle was very sexy but her character was just stupid, she was a crappy bad guy. Some of the aliens in this movie were pretty cool. Frank the Pug is back and he is hilarious, the funniest character in the whole movie. Overall, has some funny moments but other than that it just isnt a good sequel.",4,0,0,9 September 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Kubrick's Masterpiece
","So far out of Kubricks movies I have seen (2001, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut), I have declared this to be his masterpiece. It could change after I see Dr. Strangelove and Clockwork Orange but I doubt it.The acting in this movie is nothing award winning or worth a nomination but its solid acting. The Special Effects are excellent, very realistic for the 60s. The Sets are fantastic. The Directing from Kubrick is top notch in every possible way. He should have won for this. Its too bad he died without winning an award but hes in good company with Hitchcock and Scorsese but Scorsese will probably win for GONY this year, which is stupid.Overall, probably the best science fiction movie ever made.",10,0,3,24 February 2003
The Mummy Returns," Better than the first
","I think this movie is better than the first but i still think the first is excellent. This movie has it all, great action and special effects and some humor. Many people complain that this movie is just special effects well it is not it has very interesting story to it. It has better effects than the first. I think it should get nominated for special effects with Pearl Harbor. I am not sure which one should win but i think it would be very close. This is #3 on my top 100. I can not wait til the Scorpion King comes out in the spring of 2002.",10,0,0,7 December 2001
From Hell," Brilliant
","This movie was just brilliant. Czech Republic was the perfect place to film this. It's old and it could very well resemble Victorian England. There were very good costumes in this movie, and i was disappointed that it did not get a nomination. The British actors gave powerful performances, especially Ian Holm as William Gull. Johnny Depp delivered a powerful performance too. Heather Graham is not talented but very Hott with red hair and blonde. I actually think she gave a good performance, not like the other actors but good. This movie was better than Johnny Depp's Sleepy Hollow for two reasons: This has more meaning and the performances were much better, even though Sleepy Hollow had some good acting. This movie comes out on DVD in 2 days and i will buy it.",9,0,1,12 May 2002
Titanic," Worst Movie of 1997
",This movie is complete rubbish. It is two hours too long and it has terrible acting in it. The ship was the only thing really impressive and Kate winsletts boobs. But Leonardo Dicaprio was totally miscasted for the movie. The love story is pathetic. The sinking of the boat is also quite impressive. But Pearl Harbor has much better effects than this. This movie stole a whole bunch of academy awards.,1,4,16,7 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The Second time was so much better
","The Second time i saw this it was much better, it is one of my favorite movies. Excellent visual effects and Great acting. The kids were the best ones in the movie. Robbie coltrane was good as Hagrid. This was a perfect adaption to the film, nothing was missing. I cant wait till the movie comes out on DVD. I will definitely buy it.",10,0,0,11 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good Movie
","Good Movie, but not in my top 100. This movie had good special effects but that is not what a movie is all about. Its only 80 percent of what a movie should be about. This movie was 90 percent special effects. It was also way too long and could have been shortened by 25 minutes. I hope Chamber of Secrets is not as long as this one. Harry Potter, Pearl Harbor, and Castaway are way too long. But two of those are on my top 100.",10,0,0,9 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A Near-Great Film
",This movie has almost everything. It offers an interesting story about a man I know nothing about. It has first rate performances by Russell Crowe (who was robbed of an Oscar) and Jeniffer Connelly. Brilliant Direction by Ron Howard. The only problem is I get confused the second time I watched it. It doesnt make as much sense but other than that its a Near-Great Film.,9,0,1,27 March 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than the First
","Chamber of Secrets has pulled off the impossible by being better than the first, which is a surprise because Secrets was not as good a book as Sorcerers Stone. But Secrets pulls it off, it has better special effects and more action than the first. Theres better acting and more humor. It also has a little bit of a creepy vibe in some areas. 10 out of 10. Little Kids maybe afraid of parts of this movie.",10,0,0,19 December 2002
Scream 2," A Great Thriller, That Surpasses the Original
","I did not get a chance to see Scream 2 in the theater. I just never got around to it. I also had my doubts. I thought Scream would be a one time thing. When i rented this movie i was blown away. This movie had much better acting, more thrills like in the greek play when she imagines the killer, and it was funnier too. Wes Craven pulled off the impossible by making this better than the first.",10,0,0,23 May 2002
Scream," A Great Thriller
","Scream is truly a great thriller. Wes Craven is a very cool director to come up with something like this. I went into the movie theater not knowing what to expect. I came out reaizing what a great movie this was. Despite the critics reviews it was really successful at the box office. I was surprised at who the killers were. Overall, a great movie.",9,0,0,23 May 2002
Halloween," This is number one
","This is the best out of all the Halloween movies. You wont get very much out of the sequels. Number 2 and 4 are ok. Number 5 and 6 are completely dreadful. I have never seen number 3 but if it doesnt have Myers than it sucks. H20 aint as bad as 5 and 6 but its not very good. Number 8 actually looks good, but i heard this one is the best.",9,1,2,2 September 2002
Raging Bull," One Word: Excellent
",This movie is an excellent piece of work. Scorsese was screwed out of an oscar for this. De Niro was top notch as Jake LaMotta. Cathy Moriarity was really good. Joe Pesci should have won the oscar too. This movie was screwed out of a bunch of oscar wins. This beats Casino and Goodfellas to be Scorsese's second best. I still prefer Taxi Driver but its very close.,10,1,1,8 February 2003
Vanilla Sky," A Mix of Confusion But Very Entertaining
",I just rented Vanilla Sky and it was really well done. Tom Cruise made a good choice by taking this role. This movie was sort of a sleeper but it became a big hit grossing $100 million. Cameron Diaz is a very beautiful actress and displayed some talent in the movie playing a demented girl. Penelope Cruz is a beautiful actress but did not express any talent in this movie. This a really good movie but you need to stick to it and never leave because you will miss something. I give this a 9/10.,9,0,0,26 May 2002
Blade Runner," A Really Good Movie But It Has A Couple of Flaws
","All in All, Blade Runner is a really good movie, even with its two flaws. I find the Plot a little weak for a Sci-Fi movie that isn't all Action, I was expecting more of a plot since this is part Drama. The second flaw is that Harrison is not that good in his role as Deckard. By no means is he bad but he just isnt that convincing. Because of these flaws I cannot call this the best Ridley Scott movie. It is his 4th best though, just a tiny cut under Alien.",9,1,1,25 February 2003
Signs," Perfect
","This movie was absolutely Perfect. Whoever hates this movie doesn't know their head from their ass. It is a well put together movie. Mel Gibson did a great job acting. Joaquin Phoenix was funny. The kids were wonderful in the movie. The script was well done and it was nicely directed. This is better than Shamaylan's Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Signs, Spider-Man, Sum of all Fears, Unfaithful, Minority Report and hell Episode II can be in here too. Those are the best movies of the summer.",10,0,2,22 August 2002
Casino," Scorsese's Best
","I know alot of people think Goodfellas is Scorsese's best and I think its good but I think its overrated. Casino is by far his best movie. Some people say that Casino is a replica of Goodfellas but I don't see that at all. The only things i see that are the same are that Casino is about organized crime and Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are in this movie.The acting in this movie is fantastic. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are great. Sharon Stone outshines them all. She is the best actress ever to perform in a Scorsese movie. She beats Juliette Lewis in Cape Fear which was kind of a hard thing to do but Sharon made it look easy. The movie's story gets a little complicated towards the end, I forgot who ratted on Joe Pesci and got him and his brother killed. Overall, An excellent movie about the mob in Las Vegas and Scorsese's best.",10,1,1,2 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The film that got Lucas started
","This was the film that made George Lucas famous. The movie had excellent visual effects for a movie in the 70s. It did deserve the award it got for the effects. The effects do not compare to the Menace and the Clones, but they are still good.I find the movie a little slow at times. That is why it is not my favorite Star Wars. It has some great acting at times but Harrison Ford shows that he does not care for the movie in some scenes. But overall the acting is good. The movie is the third best in the series. It is not as boring as the Empire Strikes Back and does not have some of the bad acting displayed in Clones.",9,0,0,25 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Worst Part of the Series
","This was the worst part of the series. The acting was not very good and Harrison Ford seemed to really hate this one, or maybe he just did not have many good lines in the script. The acting was not as bad as to how boring this movie was. The Beginning and Ending were the best parts in the movie. The whole middle of the movie was completely boring. Yoda was the best character in the movie. Attack of the Clones was better than Empire Strikes Back, but that had its problems too.I gave this movie an 8/10. The only reason i give it an eight was bcause of the beginning and ending. If those werent good i would have given it a 7 or possibly a 6.",8,0,1,25 May 2002
Gangs of New York," Hits Some, Misses Much
","Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York is finally here, but was it worth waiting for. Well, Gangs hits some but misses much. Gangs is filled with excellent sets, beautiful costumes, and nice props. These happen to be some of the only good things about this movie.The acting was pretty bad in the movie, especially Dicaprio. Diaz and Lewis were ok at times but the script held them down alot. The script was not good at all. It had some good scenes but not enough to keep the movie together.Overall, its ok but its filled with problems.",4,1,5,22 December 2002
Gladiator," Ridley's Best
","I believe Gladiator to be Ridley Scott's best movie. It is filled with Excellent Sets, Beautiful Costumes and good Cinematography. The movie also has a Great Original Score (which should have won) and fantastic Visual Effects. Visually, this movie is beautiful.Ridley Scott's direction is excellent too. Russell Crowe gives a really good performance, he was deserving of his award. Joaquin Phoenix gives a chilling, dark and excellent performance. The rest of the cast delivers good performances too. Overall, 10 out of 10.",10,1,1,27 February 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Saw it Again and I think it is now the best one
","I saw Last Crusade again last night and I think it is now better than Temple of Doom, which used to be my favorite. But there is a good mix of action and humor in this one, especially with Sean Connery as Indy's father. I have always loved Temple of Doom cause there is a great mix in that too.Raiders is good but it is slow moving. I like it, it has some humor but its just a little boring. My order is Last Crusade, Temple of Doom and then Raiders. This is better than the Star Wars trilogy but has the same problem it does.",10,2,4,12 January 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," In Middle
","This is definitely the second best Indy. There is alot of action, but its not as impressive as TOD. Spielberg did a good job directing. GReat chemistry thats still obvious between all the actors. The story is a little less believing than the others, but thats ok. The girl in this one went back and forth. she did not know what she was doing. Overall, really good but I hope 4 is better.",10,0,1,11 June 2002
Goodfellas," Scorsese At His best
","I overreacted in saying that Casino was better than Goodfellas, that is not true. I just said that cause I heard people writing bad stuff about Casino and I didnt like that. They are both equally excellent. now I know why people say they are similar because they are both adapted screenplays from books with the same author. But it is two completely different places that they take place in.Goodfellas has a bunch of excellent performances. Joe Pesci is fantastic as a bad ass. Robert De Niro was also great, Liotta wasnt bad but he was overshadowed by the other two. Lorraine Braccos performance I think is overrated. This movie has a very well written script and deserved to win. Scorseses Direction is very well down in this movie.Now I think Scorsese should have won Best Director for this but the academy thought different. Now hes gonna win for Gangs of New York which is crap compared to Goodfellas. He will win for GONY cause they passed up the oppurtunity on Goodfellas and Raging Bull. Scorsese should have also at least be nominated for Best Director for Casino. Now he will win for a movie that doesnt deserve it.",10,0,0,27 January 2003
Goodfellas," Scorsese's Second Best
","Casino and this tie for second best Scorsese movies. I overeacted in saying that casino is better than goodfellas but they are equally great films. Casino does have similarities too goodfellas and that is Casino's only weakness. But a reason for the similarities are  cause there adapted screenplays from books by the same author so there will be some similarities between them.Goodfellas is filled with great performances in it. Robert De Niro is solid in his role. Joe Pesci was excellent, he scares me. Lorraine Braccos performance was overrated. Ray Liotta was kind of weak compared to De Niro and Pesci.Scorsese should have won for Best director and the movie should have won Best Picture. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,1 February 2003
The Godfather," The Greatest Crime Drama Ever Made
","This is by far the best Crime Drama ever made. It is much better than Goodfellas, which is good but it is a bit overrated. Marlon Brando is excellent in this movie. Although, sometimes I think of him as more of a supporting role than a leading role. He was still excellent. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all excellent in their supporting roles. I think Al Pacino was the best of all of them. Everyone else was great too. Diane Keaton was the only one who i did not care for. She just didn't really fit in.The acting is definitely a plus in the Godfather and so is its Directing. It also has one of the best scripts ever written. No flat Dialogue or any corny lines. This is and will remain the best Crime Drama ever made. Thats a promise.",10,1,3,22 October 2002
