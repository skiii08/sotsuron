Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brilliant Start to a Timeless Saga
","Critics be damned...this film is brilliant!I'm not going to say it was 100% perfect...but it came close. It certainly exceeded my (admittedly high) expectations. Let me start by saying that there is *not* a ton of character development. Then again, this is Episode I of a six-part saga. It can't develop characters intensely...it has to introduce them. And it does a great job at that.The effects are absolutely mind-boggling (especially the immense Senate chamber and Coruscant itself), and the John Williams score is (as always) phenomenal. The Neimoidians were a good addition - showing a different side of evil: greed - but not everyone might find the obvious reference to Japanese businessmen as funny as I did. Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Jake Lloyd (despite his detractors) were wonderful, and the quick appearances of Samuel L. Jackson and Terence Stamp and Warwick Davis were good as well, but as always the show-stealer is Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. In this film, he is not yet the Emperor, but simply the Senator from Naboo. But he has ambitions, and they begin to come to life in this film...My favorite parts of this film were the scenes with Palpatine. All of his scenes show there is more than meets the eye to this man, and aside from the fact that Ian McDiarmid is clearly the actor behind Darth Sidious, they make many references to his hunger for power and his plans for young Anakin. Listen carefully for a perfectly creepy line at the end of the film...my favorite in all four films!Finally, it must be said that the final battle - ESPECIALLY the intense lightsaber duel - is the most exciting and awe-inspring scene in the entire saga to date. The podrace scene is, as many have reported, another adrenaline-booster. And for all the people attacking Jar Jar Binks, he got annoying at times, but at least respect him for the phenomenal CGI work.I gave this film a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Phenomenal.
","I'm pleased to report that the special edition does the near impossible and actually *improves* on this movie. I've seen it three times in the theater this week alone, and I cry/weep exactly the same time that I have in the likely hundreds of times I've seen the film. What a great, great movie.",Null,0,0,6 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This is it!
","have to say, I was completely blown away...this totally blew Episode I out of the water within ten minutes, and, frankly, it rivals Return of the Jedi. The audience clapped as soon as the Fox logo came on, roared with cheers when the Lucasfilm logo came on, and, well, all hell broke loose when the words 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....' came on the screen. Pure delight.As far as the film...the best summary was what the CNN critic said: 'It's dark but has wonderfully funny moments; you care about the characters; and the action and special effects are first-rate.' The fight sequences, especially the final one, were amazingly intense. Lucas' directing during the lightsaber battle made beautiful use of colors, shadows, and intensity. There was also some very witty dialogue; I was particularly happy to see the C-3PO/R2-D2 banter back in full force.Yes, some of the romantic dialogue was stilted, but I actually found most to be fine...aside from a 'Sound of Music'-like moment, it was played out nicely. I was also surprised by how dark some sequences were, and how intense it was. But on the subject of reactions, if this taught me anything, it was that a lot of critics 'just don't get it.' They don't like the movie? Screw them. It was great. I'm not saying that because I was a fan. Two definite non-fans were with me, and they loved it. I'm saying it because it was everything I wanted it to be, and more.But really, I was impressed with the characters...given the negativity I heard about Natalie Portman, I thought she was fine overall. I thought Hayden Christensen was great (I have to confess that I and everyone else who think he's hot, which seems to be everyone, appreciated what appeared to be a shot that George Lucas filmed to give a male equivalent of the pure eroticism of the Princess Leia metal slave bikini, LOL). Ewan McGregor was, as always, great, but it was Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Temuera Morrison who stole the show.Wait, no. They almost stole it. It was Yoda who stole the show. The final confrontation...well...now we know why Yoda is the master. :o) The audience was literally on their feet, cheering and screaming with joy. It was incredible.When the lights came up, just about everyone was screaming and cheering and overjoyed...definitely a great sight to see, since The Phantom Menace left a sour taste in so many people's mouths.I loved it. Loved it loved it loved it loved it, and I can't wait to see it again tomorrow. Thank you, George Lucas. We love you.",10,0,0,16 May 2002
