The Mask," S-s-s-s-smoking fun!
","Jim Carrey plays Stanely Ipkiss, a business man with a very unfortunate life.He finds a mask in a river, takes it home, puts it on, and a whole new Stanely is unleashed.'The Mask' is a silly comedy filled with tons of slapstick violence, yet it has enough energy and potential to make this flick a really fun one.Is is a good family film? Take out the moderate PG-13 language and guns and you have yourself a movie that's suitable for the whole family.The one thing that struck me about this film was the award that Jim Carrey was nominated for.Was it an Oscar? No.Was it an Academy Award? No.It was a Razzie.he was actually nominated for a Razzie for worst actor in this movie.Has Hollywood lost it's taste in movies or what? Jim Carrey being nominated for a Razzie in 'The Mask' is like Tyler Perry winning an Oscar for every film he made.Talk about bad taste.Overall, I enjoyed 'The Mask' and I'm recommending it for those who love Jim Carrey and cartoonish violence.",8,1,1,30 August 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious and racist.
","If there is one thing that this movie will mostly be remembered about,it's the fact that this movie is very racist against Jews,Americans,women,and black people.But if the movie wasn't racist,then it wouldn't be as funny as it is today.To me,'Borat' is a docu-comedy,which is a documentary with plenty of gross out and slapstick humor.How vulgar is it? Well,there's a scene where two men fight each other while they're naked.Also,Borat shows a photo of his son's schlong.I'm not going to tell you what that word means,so your going to have to figure it out yourselves.Is it funny? Yes. Is it good? Most certainly.",10,0,0,1 July 2009
Alien 3," Not perfect, but watchable.
","I never got a chance to see the first 2 Alien movies.I've seen some parts, but that's about it.'Alien 3' takes our hero, Ridley, and puts her on an unknown planet that's really a prison.In the first two movies, she was forced into action by these ugly aliens that had acid for blood.Soon she finds out that an alien may be in the prison, but nobody believes her until somebody is killed by the alien.There are no weapons on the prison and the prisoners and Ridley are surrounded by the alien.What can they possibly do? You'll have to find out for yourselves.In short, 'Alien 3' is violent, gory, and slightly entertaining.It's not 'Alien Vs Predator', but it's still a good movie.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give it at least a 6.6.",7,1,2,10 August 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Incredilbe sequel.
","I thought that the first movie definitely could've been as good as 'The Incredible Hulk'.But it wasn't.Although it was entertaining,there should've been a more interesting plot along with a better cast.The sequel actually got it right.Edward Norton did a better job as the Hulk,and Liv Tyler did a better job as Betty Ross.There is also more action.And no action movie would be perfect without special effects,which in this movie are incredible.So if you enjoyed the first movie,then I definitely recommend this highly superior sequel.If you hated the first movie,then I still recommend this movie.If there is any word that sums up this movie,here it is: INCREDIBLE",9,3,4,26 June 2009
The Hangover," Does anybody know what happened last night?
","Oh,I think I remember.I went to see this movie with my friend,who wanted to see it more than I did.I just recently went to the movies to see it last night,and this movie has a resemblance,only that the characters don't remember anything and I do.Is this movie funny?Sometimes,but not gut-busting funny.Is it worth watching?Definitely.This is a raunchy comedy with an interesting plot,gross out humor,interesting characters,and Mike Tyson.Yep.4 friends are looking for the time of their lives.One is getting married,as for the rest....I'm guessing that they wanted to go.Along the way,they go to Las Vegas and get an expensive hotel room only to get trashed in the morning to leave the guys wondering what happened.One of the characters,who is a dentist,finds out that he's missing a tooth.What a night they must have had!B+",7,3,6,8 June 2009
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Steven Spielberg, how do you do it?
","'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' is yet another example of those movies that are better the second time you watch them.When I first watched it, I ended up liking it enough to give it a decent 7 out of 10.Just an hour ago, I finished watching it a second time and I can honestly say that it was way better than the first viewing.Harrison Ford does an Oscar worthy job as Indiana Jones and I don't think that there will ever be an Indy like Mr. Ford.I was also surprised at how well the action sequences were handled.The movie was made in 1981, yet the chase sequences manage to capture you and don't let go.But I mostly thank Steven Spielburg for giving us this marvelous movie and a powerful quadrilogy.What's even better is that the quadrilogy is about to turn into a quantrilogy for there will be a 5th Indiana Jones movie and hopefully Harrison will come back as Dr. Jones.I just wonder how Mr. Spielburg is able to come up with these brilliant ideas and turn them into brilliant movies.",9,0,1,13 November 2009
Kung Fu Panda," Thrilling and fun!!!
","Jack Black,Jerry Seinfeld,and Mike Myers all have something in common.Do you know what it is?They are all involved with at least one animated movie that isn't just good,but very well made and entertaining.'Shrek'isn't my favorite,but it still is an original classic.'Bee Movie'is a great movie from comic genius Jerry Seinfeld.So what is there to say about 'Kung Fu Panda?'Well,it's downright entertaining,fun and has great action sequences that keep this movie in the right place.Jack Black stars as Po,a clumsy panda who helps his father make and serve noodle soup.One day,an ancient tortoise named Oogway believes that Po is the Dragon Warrior.He can't believe it,and neither does Master Shifu,played by Dustin Hoffman.When Master Shifu learns that a certain evil villain named Tai Lung escapes from prison,he is determined to train Po for the ultimate match of his life.Expect a great cast(Jack Black,Angelina Jolie,Dustin Hoffman,Jackie Chan,Lucy Liu,and Seth Rogen),great visual effects,and great entertainment that will have you begging for a sequel.In fact,I hear that there's going to be a sequel in 2011.",9,0,1,5 June 2009
Underworld," Vampires,Werewolves,and a sexy Kate Beckinsale
","'Underworld' has everything that horror and action fans should want: violence, action, a good cast, vampires, werewolves, real-looking stunts, and a good storyline.The only thing that this movie lacks is sex.I don't have a problem with there only being one passionate kiss in the movie, but some people wish that there was more 'action', if you know what I mean.The sequel manage to take care of that problem.If there's one person we should thank for his/her performance in this movie, it should be Kate Beckinsale. Thank God that she took the part of Selene.Without her,the movie probably wouldn't be as good as I am describing how good it really is.I really want to see the third film.It looks really cool.",9,1,2,13 July 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Watch the unrated version.
","'Dawn of the Dead' is a great start for Zack Snyder.(300,Watchmen)He takes the original 1979 version,(which I haven't seen yet but I've seen the trailer)and adds a new element to it.There are some things that every zombie movie should have: 1)Lots of gore.A zombie movie isn't a zombie movie without buckets of blood and guts. 2)A good cast.Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames deliver an excellent performance and without them,this movie would have been mediocre. 3)A good script.Without a decent plot,then the movie would've been as dead as the zombies. 4)A good director.George Romero is an excellent zombie movie director,but Zack Snyder steals the show. 5)An unrated version of the theatrical release.The R-rated version was good,but the Directors cut is much better and highly recommended for zombie loving folks,such as myself.R-rated version B+ Unrated version A+",9,0,0,19 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Although I liked it, it should've been what 'The Dark Knight' was, a sequel better than the 1st.
","For me, 'Iron Man II' was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me.Given the fact that the first was sensational, I just knew this would be excellent, and maybe better than the first.Well, that's what I thought.I have good news and bad news for this movie.The good news is that 'Iron Man II' is a solid movie, no doubt.I enjoyed it.There's no reason to not see it.It's a solid piece of 2-hour entertainment.The bad news is that it was too talkative.I really hate to tell this to people going into this movie looking for non-stop action, but there's only 3, count em 3, major action sequences in the entire movie.2 are serious and quite effective while one is played mostly for comic relief, and I enjoyed it for it's sheer goofiness.The problem with it is that there is too much talking between the action.If I could estimate, I'd say there's about 20 to 25 minutes of action through out the whole movie.The other 90 minutes are nothing bu talk, talk, talk.I'm not saying I was bored, I'm just saying that there could've been more cool action sequences.Maybe 2 more wouldn't have hurt.Those looking for the same level of entertainment as the first might be a little disappointed.So I would recommend that you don't see it with high expectations.But I am recommending 'Iron Man 2' for the cool special effects, the iron man suits, and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance.A solid, but not excellent, sequel.",8,0,2,8 May 2010
Shaun of the Dead," 'Dawn of the Dead' + Simon Pegg = 'Shaun of the Dead'.
","Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver performances that are nothing short of great in their zombie comedy (zomedy) 'Shaun of the Dead'.In my opinion, 'Shaun of the Dead' isn't necessarily funny, but just because a movie isn't funny doesn't mean it's not any good.Besides from not being funny, 'Shaun of the Dead' is a fun and gory zombie movie that's well worth it's praise from people like George A. Romero, Peter Jackson, and Stephen King.I even liked it better than the average 'Hot Fuzz'.You can expect two best friends rising from their couch and stop watching TV in order to protect themselves from flesh eating zombies.You can also expect a movie that is both lots of fun and quite gory.Just don't expect anything Oscar worthy.",8,0,2,26 September 2009
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Expect the expected
","Graphic language+inappropriate humor+Guest stars such as Conan O'Brian+Strong animated violence=South Park:Bigger,Longer and Uncut.If you are a big fan of the television series,then you will not be disappointed with the movie.The only difference between the show and the movie is that the humor is more inappropriate in the movie.Oh,it's also longer.Just like the series,the movie will have you dying with laughter as Stan Marsh,Kyle Brofloski,Eric Cartman,and Kenny McCormick get into all sorts of trouble.I love the TV series,and although I can't say I loved the movie,I did like it.Warning:Do not let little kids see this movie.Before you know it,They'll be dropping F-bombs all over the house.For adults and teens who can handle the content only.",7,0,1,23 May 2009
Spider-Man 2," Outstanding sequel.
","The first and third 'Spider-Man' movies were simply fantastic.But it gets even better with 'Spider-Man 2'. It's full of action, has plenty of adventure, and is full of award winning special effects.Like any other super hero sequel, there's always a new villain.The villains name in 'Spider-Man 2' is Dr. Octopus.AKA Doc Ock.He has 4 mechanical tentacles that can flip cars and throw people at great distances.Does he remind you of anything? Of course he does.What does he remind you of? An Octopus... Duh.It may sound kind of stupid, but Doc Ock's character actually helps the movie become a 2 hour roller-coaster ride of a movie.Just remember that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can.",10,56,72,15 July 2009
Finding Nemo," Great fish story.
","'Finding Nemo' revolves around 2 clown fish: Marlin and Nemo.When Nemo disobeys his father, he gets captured by scuba divers and is taken to an aquarium.Marlin must do whatever it takes to find his son.Soon enough, he meets a blue tang fish named Dory, who has short term memory loss.Their journey to find Nemo involves almost every kind of peril you could imagine in the ocean.They encounter sharks, giant jellyfish, a whale, pigeons, and fisherman.This is definitely not your average fish story.'Finding Nemo' has remained a classic after being around for 6 years.The movie never gets old and will appeal to both kids and their parents.There's also some stunning animation and lots of humor and adventure.The movie also has a wonderful role model.Marlin is actually willing to risk his life and search the whole ocean just to find his son.Now that is what I call bravery.",10,0,1,27 September 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Highly recommended for those who have or haven't seen the other X-men movies.
","From the look of the preview,I thought that this movie was going to be pretty good.So me and my friend decided to go see this movie together.After the movie was over,I didn't want to wait until the movie came out on DVD.I loved this movie!!!I haven't seen the other X-men movies,but even I know that they can't possibly be as good as X-men origins:Wolverine.The special effects were outstanding,the acting was top notch,and the storyline was as powerful as Wolverine himself.Here are all of the words that describe this movie:Outstanding,intelligent,awesome,fantastic,exciting,jaw dropping,wonderful,and X-cellent.Don't hesitate.Go see this movie NOW!!!!",10,17,31,2 May 2009
Orphan," I'm at a loss of words.
","'Orphan' is about as dark and disturbing as any other movie about a couple who adopted a seemingly polite child.Esther may seem like a smart 9-year old who behaves well and has a great talent at painting.Like any other movie about a child who seems polite, there's always something wrong with the child.It just goes to show that there IS something wrong with Esther.Do you want to know all of the bad things that she did in the movie? She kills a nun by bashing her in the head with a hammer over and over.She lights a tree house on fire while there is a boy on top of it screaming for help.She smothers a child to death with a pillow.She even seduces her father.On a scale of 1 to 10 of how crazy Esther is, she scores a positive 11.I have never seen a movie as dark or disturbing as 'Orphan'. It is an excellent horror movie, but some of the scenes were so gruesome that I'd figure that I would have nightmares for a week.What really made the movie good was it's twists and turns.There are so many of them, that this movie seems like an older version of other thrillers like 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' and 'The Omen'.If you're going to see this movie, you better have a strong stomach, because this movie is just plain crazy, in a good way.Take my word for it and whatever you do, never let your children see this movie.I'm 13 years old so I should know if this movie is too grizzly and shocking for kids.You are in for 123 minutes that will have you shaking once the movie is over.",10,29,49,26 July 2009
Terminator Salvation," People really need to loosen up and have fun if they want to enjoy an action movie.
","'Terminator Salvation' is an excellent scifi/action movie that really doesn't need to be taken seriously.It's big.It's loud.It's action packed.It's also one of the most misunderstood action movies this year since 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen', which I also enjoyed.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie.It has great CGI effects, great characters, and a solid plot.John Conner is taken over by Christain Bale, who has his own share of great movies that include 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'.Everyone should agree with me that Christain Bale did a far better job as John Connor than the other actors who played John in part two and three.Those who don't agree with me simply don't know how to enjoy a good action movie.Take my word for it and go see this movie if you haven't already.You won't be disappointed.",8,12,22,6 August 2009
Spider-Man 3," Spideys back in another excellent adventure
","I am a huge,and I mean HUGe,fan of the first two Spider-man movies and just finding out that another one would be released just blew me away.This movie was mind blowing!!!!!!!Fans of the first two shouldn't be disappointed by a movie with terrific special effects and great directing by the one and only Sam Raimi.Not only are the special effects great but the movie also had a great sense of humor.It's probably because Peter Parker decided to turn emo and dance in the street.overall,you should totally see this movie if you just love special effects wrapped in great humor and a really good plot.10/10.nuff said.",8,1,2,4 May 2009
Yes Man," Did I like 'Yes Man' ? Yes.
","Would you be willing to say yes to everything just to prove that you're not just an ordinary and shallow man? Now who in the world would actually do this? Apparently and fortunately, Jim Carrey.The comic genius who gave us 'The Mask' and the Ace Ventura movies returns with something new and refreshing.He takes the literal use of the word 'Yes' and mixes it with lots of comedy and some romance and the outcome is a movie that's both simple and entertaining.So why are people saying 'No' to 'Yes Man'? Is it because you're tired of the same old crude humor that he's always involved with when it comes to his movies.C'mon, this is a good movie that really doesn't need rude behavior or slapstick violence to make it's own purpose on comedy.I say 'No' to the people who dislike Carrey's work and I most certainly say 'Yes' to 'Yes Man'.",8,3,4,21 November 2009
Knocked Up," Judd Apatow is simply a genius
","I liked Judd Apatow's first comedy,'The 40-Year Old Virgin'.When it comes to comedy,Judd knows exactly how to make people laugh until they beg him to make another movie.'Knocked Up'isn't just funny.It's a smart and refreshing movie that actually teaches a lesson:make sure you wear a condom when you have sex with a woman.But if you want a child,then do whatever that floats in your mind.The one thing that I probably dislike about the movie is it's running time.Even you probably wouldn't want to watch a really funny movie that lasts 129 minutes.But its definitely worth it when it comes to 'Knocked Up' and Judd Apatow.Grab some popcorn,get some friends,and laugh your butt off at this funny and brilliant comedy if you haven't already.",8,22,39,13 May 2009
Blades of Glory," Sharp as a blade.
","'Blades of Glory' is as sharp as blade and glorious like a feel-good comedy starring Will Ferrell, Jon Heder, and Craig T. Nelson.It's also a funny look at the REAL face of ice skating.If you were an ice skater and you lost your career, would you ice skate with someone of the same sex to get your career back? Now you know the basic plot of 'Blades of Glory'. It's 93 minutes of sharp and edginess fun that you will no doubt enjoy.But prepare yourself, because this movie is also full of inappropriate and sometimes gay humor.Still, it's nothing short of funny and entertaining.If you enjoyed 'Anchorman' with Will Ferrell and 'Napoleon Dynamite' with Jon Heder, then 'Blades of Glory' will surely tickle your funny bone and keep you occupied with an hour and a half comedy.",9,1,3,23 July 2009
Predator," 'If it bleeds, we can kill it'
","Arnold Scwrazenegger from 'Commando' and Carl Weathers from 'Rocky' deliver powerful performances in this classic sci-fi/action film known as 'Predator'. Those of you who love action and gore will not be disappointed.The movie itself at times seems to be non-stop action and excitement.It sure is more fun than the so-so 'Predator 2'. My favorite character in the movie is the predator.What can be cooler than having the ability to turn invisible and having infrared vision? Somebody please tell me what can be cooler than what I just said.That's what I thought.'Predator' is an explosive, action-packed, and bloody sci-fi movie that just can't be missed.",9,1,2,18 July 2009
Watchmen," watch the watchmen!!!
","I really wasn't crazy about seeing this movie,but my friend said that he really wanted to see it so I decided that i was going to see it with him.And I Was Not Disappointed!!!Out of all the superhero movies that i have seen,this one is without a doubt the most violent yet captivating one yet.I love the characters,I love the special effects,and I love how good that this movie turned out to be.I must say that this movie is extremely overrated.Some people who have seen this(some were fans of the comic book)said that they were extremely disappointed.But I say:Who cares?The movie is very beautiful in every way a movie should be.Go watch the Watchmen.",8,0,1,15 March 2009
28 Weeks Later," Best zombie movie ever? No. Gory over-the-top zombie movie? Yep.
","Here is '28 Weeks Later': an over-the-top and graphic zombie movie that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination.As a horror movie, expect countless people spitting blood and gore shattering at the screen.As a zombie movie, expect red eyed, rage infected people gouging out their victim's eyes and leaving nothing behind but gore, gore, and more gore.This movie takes the somewhat goriness of the first movie and multiplies it by 10.Yeah, it's a pretty violent movie, but it's also a well-made movie that both horrifies and entertains.It's not quite as good as '28 Days later', but it does enough brutal violence and never-ending gore that makes this movie a real reason why people go see these movies in the first place.Waiting for '28 Months Later'.",7,0,0,1 October 2009
Armageddon," 'Armageddon' is the opposite of the title.
","The real definition of Armageddon is the end of mankind.For lots of people, the definition of the movie is an absolutely terrible mess that won't have you caring if a giant meteor came to Earth and killed us all.For me, the definition of the movie is an extravaganza packed with state-of-the-art special effects and action sequences.I just don't know why so many people don't like this movie.I thought that Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Owen Wilson, and Steve Buscemi all did an excellent job in this movie.This is the third Michael Bay film that I've seen, the first 2 were 'Transformers' and 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'. Just like those two films, 'Armageddon' is stuffed with explosions, special effects, a worthy cast, and even some humor.Michael bay may not be Steven Spielberg, but he does deserve the kind of respect that filmmakers should receive instead of being hated by most film critics and snobs who don't know how to enjoy good movies.",8,3,4,16 August 2009
BASEketball," 'He's 8 years old and he smells like Robert Downey Jr.'
","Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the show 'South Park' , return with something entirely different.They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball.This sport is known as baseketball.It's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there's another letter e in the title.Here's how you play: you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot.Sounds simple.In fact, I might try it one day.After the game hits the streets, it soon becomes a huge success.Who would've known that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that became so successful?My opinion'Baseketball' is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence, yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainment.A definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor.",7,3,5,28 August 2009
Over the Hedge," A delightful adventure that adults will enjoy as much as kids will.
","From Dreamworks Animation Studios comes 'Over The Hedge'.This is simply a fun animated movie that should not be seen by just kids but also by adults.There is absolutely nothing in this movie that not one kid or adult of any age should not enjoy.What is there not to like or love? The animation is Oscar worthy, every character is simply fantastic, the story is delightful, and the humor is fun and very entertaining.I'm sure that kids will enjoy the potty humor, but older people will be laughing at it themselves.Ah, what a great movie.It really wouldn't hurt if there was going to be an 'Over The Hedge' sequel.I can see millions of dollars grossing at the box office and tons of people clapping and cheering if there were a sequel.Until then, give 'Over The Hedge' a check and you just might wish for a sequel.I give it a solid 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,12 November 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terrific action, great special effects, solid cast, great movie.
","'T2: Terminator 2' or 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' is truly an example of how sequels can be better than the original.Here we are given more action, more special effects, more interesting characters, and a better terminator.It is truly a special and crowning achievement for director/producer/writer James Cameron.It's a film that knows how to make action sequences exciting and how to add some humor into them.That's something you don't get very often.I'll admit that the first movie was great, but it's mediocre compared to the greatness of 'T2'.The movie's key success is Arnold Schwarzenegger.Never will there be an actor who will do a better job as the terminator, for Arnold does it so perfectly that you think of him as a machine and not just an actor.I'll also admit that the villain is also a key role in the movie.Robert Patrick plays his role with lots of potential and you actually care that he's in the movie, even though he's a villain.There's also Linda Hamilton.She returns to her same old role as in the first movie, Sarah Connor.In the first movie, she just seemed like an ordinary person who's being chased by a killer machine.Here, she's a tough and smart character that never bores you and always keeps you interested when she's on the screen.Then there's the action and special effects.Outstanding, just outstanding.The film was made in the early 90's, and the effects are really this good?It just amazes me how Cameron knows how to put these great characters in these exciting action sequences.To put it in a couple of words, this is a GREAT movie.",10,9,12,13 December 2009
Disturbia," This movie will probably make you wonder if your neighbor is a serial killer.
","Shia LeBeouf has many great movies,such as 'Transformers','Eagle Eye',and 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'.Although I can't say that this was as good as any of those other movies,I can say that this film was extremely entertaining and suspenseful at some parts.Some people said that this movie was a rip-off of another movie called 'Rear Window',which supposedly has the same plot as 'Disturbia' only the main character is in a wheelchair.Who cares?This is a well made and suspenseful thriller that doesn't deserve to be called a rip-off or a bad example of a horror movie.So give this movie a chance and like it for what it is.",7,2,3,17 May 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Not perfect,but its really funny
","I was really excited to see this movie,but I only made through half of the movie twice for reasons that don't involve me wanting to leave the theater because I thought it was bad,even though it wasn't.But on the third time,I managed to watch the entire movie.Although this movie isn't excellent,it does have some great belly laughs that even adults will enjoy.My favorite part of the movie was when the president was trying to communicate with the alien spaceship with a keyboard,which they took from a movie called 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind',and then switched to Axel F.I could barely breathe when I saw that part.Overall,you should go see it.7/10",7,0,0,13 May 2009
Face_Off," Travolta and Cage steal the show!
","After watching 'Face/Off', I looked at the box of the DVD and I was shocked that the movie was released in 1997.How was this movie made in 1997? The action sequences resemble 'Death Race', which was made in 2008, and this was made in 1997?I'm not complaining about this.Actually, I praise the stunt work and action in this movie.Now I'll be sure to watch some of John Woo's other movies, 'like 'Hard Boiled'.What else is there to say besides that the special effects are amazing? Hmmmm.Oh, the movie itself is amazing.I did not reconsider any 1 minute of this 139 minute action packed thrill ride that kept me on the edge of my seat.Even one of my friends really liked this movie.In fact, he was the one who introduced me to it.He asked me if I wanted to watch it and I said 'Yes', not knowing that the movie would turn out to be a sure Oscar nominee.John Travolta and Nicholas Cage delivered some great, and I mean GREAT, performances.Without them, the movie probably would've been good, but not as good as with John and Nicholas.Add in some humor and you have yourself a roller coaster that lasts for two and a half hours and will make you clap and applaud.",9,4,6,11 October 2009
Spider-Man," Great comic book adventure.
","'Spider-Man' is a great example of a comic book based movie.It has plenty of style,action,heart and has a great message that everyone can swing to: With great power comes great responsibility.For example,if you wake up one day and you find out that you have superhuman strength,use it for the good of mankind.Don't use it for evil.When something great lands in your laps,use it wisely.Don't take advantage of it.That's why Spider-Man is such a great superhero.Well,many superheros use their powers for good,but Spider-Man is still great.So everybody should sit down and enjoy this wonderful superhero movie that's a feast for the eyes and imagination.But don't just watch this movie.Watch the sequels.They're even better.",9,0,1,13 July 2009
Ratatouille," If you're looking for an excellent movie that will serve your appetite,this movie is for you.
","For a movie about a rat who gets separated from his parents and ends up in the streets of Paris and becomes a chef,'Ratatouille' does an excellent job at serving it's audience with a brilliant piece of animation with a side of comedy of heart.Adults and teens will love this movie as kids do,no matter what their age is.It's simply too good to be true.Patton Oswalt plays the voice of Remy,a rat who gets separated by his friends and family in the sewer.Moments later,he enters the sewers of Paris,where he meets and forms a relationship with a human named Linguini.It gets even better,but I won't spoil it for you.",10,1,3,8 July 2009

","With it's bloody violence, interesting characters, and a solid script, 'Saw III' keeps the franchise sharp and going strong.It picks off after 'Saw II' where Detective Matthews was locked in the bathroom used in the very original.This sequel opens with him trying to get out of his shackle and you probably know how he gets out if there's no key and all you see is a hacksaw and a big rock.A nurse named Lynn is captured by one of Jiggsaw's accomplices for a very important reason.The Jigsaw killer( AKA John Kramer) has been having some really bad problems involving his head and now he puts his faith in Lynn to save him.You probably think that Lynn is just going to kill Jigsaw and his accomplice and just escape.That is where you are wrong if that was what you were thinking.Lynn has a device strapped to her neck that is basically a bomb.This neck-brace will detonate if John dies or she is out of range of John.So she has no choice and must help John if they both want to live.Meanwhile, John has a trick up his sleeve.He kidnaps Jeff, a man who is still mourning the loss of his son.When he is captured, he is given tasks by Jigsaw that involves the revenge that he has always wanted on his son's killer.If he can get through his tasks in 2 hours and Jigsaw is still alive, Lynn and Jeff can go free.That's pretty much the premise of 'Saw III' and I can say that it wasn't a bad one at all.Add some gruesome death scenes to this movie and you have yourself a darn good horror film that has you begging for more.Be sure to check out the unrated version.",8,0,1,30 October 2009
Tropic Thunder," good entertainment
","Ben Stiller,Robert Downey Jr.,Jack Black,Tom Cruise and Matthew Mchougnay deliver excellent performances in Ben Stillers 'Tropic Thunder',an extremely violent,and at times funny,comedy.The movie also had really good action scenes and some decent gore effects.Close your eyes and imagine Jack Black biting the head off of a bat.Imagine that.Tugg Speedman(Stiller),Kirk Lazurus(Downey),and Jeff Portnoy(Black) are three talented actors who are shipped in to a real jungle to film a movie.And thats where the fun begins.Warning:This movie may offend some races,so if you don't want to be offend(depends on you're race),then you shouldn't watch this.",8,1,2,11 May 2009
Resident Evil," Good zombie flick.
","'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is my favorite movie in the series.If I had a chance to see the 4th film, which was animated, then I would probably like it better since it got a good score on IMDb.But anyway, I can't say that the first was as good as the second, but it still is a nice piece of film.Fans of zombie movies and video games shouldn't be disappointed.What can a person not like about this film? Sure, it may not be as good as 'Dawn of the Dead', but it's still a zombie movie, and a good one too.What the movie really needed was some gore.There was a little blood, but I love to see a movie with people being torn apart by zombies.Lucky for me, the 3rd film managed to fix that problem.Bottom line: 'Resident Evil' is a good zombie film with a terrific performance by Mila Jovovich.The sequels are better, in my opinion.",8,0,0,23 July 2009
Alien vs. Predator," Don't hate me.
","What's there to say about AVP?Well,the action scenes and special FX are pretty good.Second,this movie takes two classic horror icons and puts them in a totally underrated science-fiction film that shouldn't disappoint people.So let me ask this question.Why in the world do so many people(including some of my friends)hate this movie?What more do you people want?Cut this movie some slack,will ya?Paul Anderson is a great director and I think that I know which direction he's trying to go.He has made many good movies,such as 'Death Race' and 'Resident Evil'.So I guess that I'm the only person to give him credit for his work.Thank you,Paul.",8,3,5,14 May 2009
District 9," 'District 9' earns a 10.
","'District 9' is a masterpiece.It's a science fiction film that grabs you and won't let go.It's stuffed with special effects that are nothing short of extraordinary.In fact, the aliens in this movie look just about as real as you and I.No kidding.They're so good, that it's hard to believe that they're not real.For me, this is a difficult movie to review.I can't really think of anything else to say except that this is one of the years best films and deserves to win an Oscar for best picture and special effects.If this movie gets nominated for a Razzie, I will be absolutely furious that people can't enjoy great movies like 'District 9'.It's just a fascinating movie that may as well be called one of the best sci/fi pictures so far this year.it clocks in at 112 minutes and it didn't contain 1 boring minute.FYI, 'District 9' is a bloody and violent movie.It also contains at least 100 uses of the F-word, so I would recommend this movie only for teens and not for kids who really want to see it because they love aliens.This is my list of the movies this year that I recommend you see.Halloween 2, The Final Destination, Funny People, The Ugly Truth, Orphan, Fighting, Up, and District 9.It's THAT good.",10,1,4,13 September 2009
Batman Begins," This is what Oscars are made of.
","To tell you the truth,this is the first Batman movie that I have seen.The reason why I didn't see the previous films was because I thought the whole 'guy dressing as a bat' plot didn't appeal to me.'Batman Begins','Batman & Robin',and 'The Dark Knight' are the only Batman movies that I have seen so far.But since I'm 13 years old,I have plenty of time to view the others.Christain Bale plays Bruce Wayne,a billionaire whose parents were gunned down when he was a child.In the beginning of the movie,Bruce is in prison.But then he meets Henri Ducard,who gets Bruce out of prison and teaches him martial arts so he can go back to Gotham City and rid the city of criminals.Once he gets home,he invents a suit,gadgets,etc.and becomes Batman.All goes well until Gotham faces a villain known as Scarecrow,who plans to poison Gotham's water supply with a drug that'll have the city tearing itself apart.So now,it's up to the dark knight to defeat Scarecrow and save the city.This is an excellent superhero movie with dazzling special effects,a wonderful cast of the highest order,and a plot that's as strong as Batman himself.",10,0,1,12 June 2009
Cars," Another Pixar masterpiece.
","My favorite movies from Pixar are 'Up' and 'Wall-e',but 'Cars' did what those two movies did: entertain an audience with spectacular animation and family friendly humor.The cast is also great: Owen Wilson,Larry the Cable Guy,Michael Keaton,George Carlin,and so on.The movie is basically about talking cars,but in this movie,it's more than just talking cars.This movie runs 116 minutes,probably too long for some kids who have short attention spans,but soon,they'll follow into the rhythm of this purely delightful animated feast that should be viewed by every eye on the entire planet.'Cars' is a fast paced,colorful,and speedy animated film with great potential.",10,0,0,6 July 2009
Bolt," Delightful fun from start to finish.
","John Travolta stars as a superstar dog and Miley Cyrus is his owner in Disney's 'Bolt'.Although this movie lacks the awe that some other movies like 'Wall-e' and 'Up' had, 'Bolt' does manage to entertain us and please adults as much as kids.John Travolta is a very talented actor and I think that him playing a talking dog was the right thing to do.Get someone else to do it and it might not have been so good.Famous singer/actress Miley Cyrus plays Bolt's owner, and I honestly have to say that she didn't do a bad job here.Her music may suck because of how clean the lyrics are and the look of her movie looks Razzie worthy, but she manages to do a decent job in 'Bolt'.I also have to give a hand to the some of the action sequences and mostly the animation.In short: 'Bolt' is a fun 96 minute animated movie that's delightful fun from the very start to the very finish.",8,1,2,20 November 2009
2012," Solid ***(1/2) out of ****
","'2012' is a significant action movie that really causes some controversy with it's targeted movie-goers.People who have seen the movie or trailer will constantly ask themselves the same question over and over again.Will the world really end in 2012? I'm not sure what to believe and All I can say is that this film is not for those who believe it enough to lock themselves in their bomb shelters ahead of time.The special effects used to show the disasters that will occur look as real as they get, and that's what I mean when I don't think it's for everyone.But let's talk about the movie.'2012' is an action-packed thrill ride that knows how to drop the jaws of every person who's been dying to see special effects that are even better than the ones in the 'Transformers' movies.In other words, it's a fairly great movie packed with unforgettable special effects and action sequences.It's no masterpiece by any means, but the performances by John Cusack and Danny Glover + the Oscar worthy special FX makes '2012' a nice action film to see.P.S: The film runs at 158 minutes in length, so if you really don't like it and your at the 90 minute mark, just leave the theater.No one's going to stop you.",8,1,5,21 November 2009
The Incredibles," Incredible entertainment!
","Here is a list of all of the things that makes this movie incredible: the action sequences, the special effects, the characters, and the entertainment that the movie delivers.It's just 115 minutes of non-stop action that will leave you breathless.Just to let you know, this is more of an action movie than a comedy.Don't expect plenty of belly laughs.Instead, expect plenty of mind blowing action scenes that makes this movie an incredible treat for kids and adults.There's also a really good cast.Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jason Lee all star in this wonderful superhero movie that will make for some great entertainment that the whole family will love.Now I understand why this movie is on the top 250 movies on IMDb.If you think that movies about a family of superheros couldn't be this good, you were dead wrong.Here is a movie that will remain a timeless classic until another movie about a family of superheros comes along and will be even better than 'The Incredibles'.Does anyone know if there will be a sequel? If there's going to be a sequel, then I need to know.Almost every great movie deserves a sequel.In short, 'The Incredibles' can only be summed up with one word and one word only: Incredible.Yeah, it's that good.",10,0,0,2 August 2009

","To tell you the truth, I thought this movie would suck.I have 2 reasons why I thought this movie would hit rock bottom: I haven't seen the first and I wanted to see a different movie.But I wasn't disappointed.Just like the first, this movie was packed with both action and humor.It's also more tame than the first.So this movie would make a really good family movie.The special effects were also great.This is the kind of movie that's called a 'boom-fest'. I'm sure you know what that means.You know, a movie with tons of action and mind blowing special effects.If you liked or loved the first movie, then I highly recommend this movie.",8,1,3,18 July 2009
Transformers," Much better than expected
","At first,I thought this movie would be really dumb because I thought that the whole giant talking robots that can transform into cars genre was kinda stupid.But if you have ever heard of the phrase 'Dont judge a book by its cover',this movie is the perfect example of that phrase.This movie is a mind blowing action film that has a lot of humor and great special effects wrapped in a 135 minute package.Michael Bay knows exactly what he's doing when he takes the action genre and adds a new element to it and that gives you an awesome and thrilling film that should be seen by anyone if they love action films.Thank you Michael.I really appreciate it.",10,0,2,7 May 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Sunny with a chance of entertainment.
","'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs' may as well be called the funniest animated film of the year, because I have never laughed as much as I did at an animated movie.Parents, I guarantee you that if you go see this movie with your kids, you will be in for one hilarious and exciting ride that makes this film almost as good as 'Up'.Flint Lockwood has been an inventor ever since he was a kid, but most of his inventions have been failures.He has made a walking television set, a lotion that can give you hair, and rat birds, which I claim to be rats and birds combined together.It then hits him.The whole town has been forced to eat nothing but sardines.Of course, nobody in the town of Swallow Falls enjoy sardines.There's also a heading in the newspaper that says sardines are gross.What if Flint can fix all of that? What if he can invent a machine that converts water into food? Well, he tries it and it actually works.Soon, everyone in Swallow Falls love Flint's invention.What's even better is that it will give you any food you want.Pizza, french fries, mashed potatoes, jello, ice cream, bacon, cheeseburgers, eggs, cheese, steak, olives, toast, donuts, and so on.Unfortantly for Swallow Falls, things get much worse.The food starts to get bigger and causes the town and everyone else in the world nothing but destruction and chaos.It's now up to Flint to save the day from what may be a food apocalypse.Me and my friend sat in our seats, laughed endlessly, and couldn't wait until the DVD came out.When it does, I'll be sure to get it on the first day.If not the first day, I'll be sure to get it and watch it over and over again.",10,52,85,19 September 2009
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Hot babes with guns vs. zombies
","The first movie was a well acted and slick horror movie that kept me entertained.So what's there to say about the sequel? Well,it's fun and much more entertaining than the first,in my opinion.There's more action than blood and guts,which makes this movie the perfect popcorn crowd pleaser.I liked Mike Epps's and Oded Fehr's performance in the movie,but the real star is Milla Jovovich who returns as Alice,the hero from the first movie.The basic plot is this: The Umbrella corporation unleashes a deadly virus in Racoon City.But this isn't just any virus.It's the T-virus,a virus that turns people into zombies.Well,that's it,I guess.Definitely check this movie out.You will not be disappointed.",10,1,3,2 July 2009
Paranormal Activity," Unlike anything you've ever experienced.
","'Paranormal Activity' is the kind of film that raises some serious questions.Do ghosts and demons exist? Did everything that happened in this film happen in real life? Is it truly one of the most terrifying movie experiences of all time? You'll have to find out for yourself.All I can tell you is that I do believe in supernatural spirits and everything that happened in this movie seemed to be very real.However, I hear that there is an alternate ending.If there is one, then the movie is just another shaky camera movie just like 'Cloverfield' and 'Diary of the Dead'. Nonetheless, this is a truly scary horror movie that should not be seen alone.Yeah, it's that scary.There are even some rules if your going to see it and these are real.You can't be pregnant, you can't be old, and you have to go the bathroom before you see it.Now THAT is scary.'Paranormal Activity' will shake you to your core and will have you shaking and fearing about going to sleep once you walk out of the theater.",8,1,3,23 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Mmmmmm.....Chocolate.
","This movie surprisingly has many comparisons to candy.It's sweet, delightful, and rich in taste.Johnny Depp also does a marvelous job as Willy Wonka himself.There's nothing that parents will have to worry about this movie.It'll make a fine and delicious treat that the whole family will devour over and over again.It's also better than the original, in my opinion.But Johnny Depp isn't the only big star in the movie.The movie itself wouldn't be as candy-coated as it is today without the performance of Freddie Highmore( August Rush), who plays Charlie Bucket.Trust me when I say that you will be in for 115 minutes of pure and delightful fun.This is one movie that even chocolate can't top.",10,4,6,20 July 2009
The Dark Knight," Everything a Batman fan should want!!!!
","Okay,I have to be honest that I didn't really like batman until I saw Batman Begins which was surprisingly excellent.When I heard all of the great reviews,I decided to see if those people were right or wrong.Apparently,they are right.The Dark Knight succeeds as an excellent movie on almost every level.This is how other comic book based movies should be like.Its a shame that Heath Ledger died because he makes the best villain ever.Christain Bale also makes the best Batman than the others.So yes:this movie is definitely worth 144 minutes of your time and trust me:Whether you are or not a Batman fan you will enjoy this movie.10/10",10,1,4,16 March 2009
Toy Story," Pixar's first movie doesn't disappoint.
","I recently catched the showing of 'Toy Story' and 'Toy Story 2' with my older sister, her boyfriend, and my friend.My sister really wanted to see this movie because it was being showed in 3-d and I also wanted to catch a look.In the end, she was disappointed with the fact that there wasn't enough 3-d.While that is a fact, I can honestly say that i was not disappointed in any way.'Toy Story' is an absolute masterpiece with great animation and a wonderful message about not leaving friends behind.Now I'm really excited about the new and upcoming 'Toy Story 3'.It's going to be released in 2010 and will be shown in 3-d also.If you can't manage to catch the showing of 'Toy Story' and the sequel, go out and buy the dvds or watch them if you do have it.As a Pixar movie, it's great.As an animated movie, it's incredible.As a plain movie, it's nothing short of Oscar worthy.",10,0,0,9 October 2009

","I have not seen any of the animated or live-action films that were called 'Alice In Wonderland' or 'Alice goes to Wonderland' or 'Wonderland In Alice'.I honestly don't have an urge to.But I'm glad I saw this movie.It isn't quite as good as 'Charlie and the Chocolate Facotry', another Tim Burton movie starring Johney Depp, but it's great entertainment nonetheless.What can't escape my thought is why this movie is getting bad reviews.well, the movie's been doing good at the Box office so far and it's making a lot of money, but the reviews on this website are really starting to make me wonder if people have just lost their edge.Really, don't you people think that your being a little harsh.What's not to like about this movie? So it's not a masterpiece, but it's still a pretty good film.I will admit that it's not near as good as 'C&TCF', but c'mon, it's not bad or anything.I'm giving 'Alice In Wonderland' an 8.5 out of 10.That's just me.Don't judge me.Don't insult me.Just let me be.",9,3,5,25 March 2010
Avatar," Take every positive adjective in the world and you have every word that describes how good this movie really is.
","'Avatar' is not only one of the best science fiction movies of 2009, but it's also a really groundbreaking sci-fi movie that actually may be nominated for an Oscar.Even before it's release on December 19, the film has already been nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards.I have to say that that's pretty darn impressive for a movie that's been heavily hyped and critically acclaimed.Now we get to witness what may be James Cameron's best work to date.Now we can witness the movie that critics around the globe are calling a must-see film.These critics aren't just right about the film, they know 100% how to enjoy good movies and 'Avatar' is one of those good movies.With it's groundbreaking and superbly realistic CGI and action sequences, dynamic characters, and a very convincing plot, 'Avatar' is an unmissable film that I guarantee you will either like or love.There's simply nothing to not like about this movie.Anyone who thinks they've seen way better computer generated images and better movies are simply missing the point and can't enjoy good movies.I must admit that the movie is long.Clocking in at 162 minutes, 'Avatar' makes you wish that the movie was longer so that there was more to appreciate.But in the end, we end up being satisfied anyway.We're left with a breath-taking sci-fi action/adventure that not even the first 2 Terminator movies could compete with.James Cameron, you are the hope and future of America.Your movies are sensational and I truly think that you have found the true director that was inside of you all along.Don't stop making movies.Make another Terminator movie.Make another Alien movie.And don't forget to make a sequel to 'Avatar'.9.5/10",10,4,10,18 December 2009
Toy Story 2," What rhymes with plastic? Fantastic.

'Toy Story 2' not only captures the originality of the first movie, it also combines it with plenty of adventure and splendid animation that makes this sequel a real fun surprise.I mentioned in my review for the first 'Toy Story' that I managed to catch the 2 movies at once at the movie theater in 3-d.The effects may not have been great, but that doesn't mean that the movies weren't any good.This is a splendid movie that's not just a kids movie.It's a movie that everyone of every age should not miss.",10,0,1,9 October 2009

The Descent," Descend into 'The Descent'.
","'The Descent' revolves around some friends who decide to go caving, only to get trapped due to a cave-in.Nothing else can go wrong, right? If that's what you were asking, you were dead wrong.What follows next is an unbelievably gory and violent event that will make you puke your guts out.Inside of the cave are these flesh eating mutants that are blind, but their sense of hearing and smell makes it easy for them to track down their prey.One by one, the survivors are picked off and are murdered in very brutal and gory manners.If you can't handle throats being slit, eyes being plucked out, heads being bashed against rocks, and blood and guts flying in every direction , then this movie is NOT for you.Director Neil Marshall takes fear and claustrophobia and adds a whole new element to it that makes this movie an absolutely gory yet entertaining roller coaster of a ride that will have you screaming and waving your arms in the air at the same time.What's even better is that there will be a sequel in October, but Neil Marshall isn't going to direct.Hopefully, it will be either as good or better than this one.Not recommended for the weak of heart or stomach.If you think you can handle the amount of gore and bloodshed in 'The Descent', then try to watch this movie without puking in a bucket.I will guarantee you that you won't be disappointed.Thank you, Neil Marshall.",10,3,6,11 August 2009

Would you put shrooms in a priest's pizza just to break your friend out of a Christain school? Would you beat up a little kid for his tickets for the concert that you really wanted to go to?

Zombieland," 4 survivors, battling 100's of zombies, in search of 1 Twinkie.
","With it's gory violence, interesting characters, and flesh eating zombies, 'Zombieland' knows exactly how the zombie genre works and how you can add a little humor to it.The whole movie revolves around Columbus.He is a survivor of an infection that has ravaged most of the world and has turned millions of people into flesh eating corpses.He soon finds out that he is not alone. He meets another survivor named Tallahassee.When they gang up, Tallahassee tells Columbus that he's searching for something.You're probably asking yourself what this thing is.It's a Twinkie.Just an ordinary Hostees Twinkie.Afterall, he explains that it may be the last Twinkie in the universe that anyone could ever enjoy.They soon reach a grocery store where they encounter two other survivors, Wichita and Little Rock.They hijack Columbus and Tallahassee of their vehicles and weapons and they soon encounter each other once more.They eventually learn that they must stay together if they want to survive the zombie apocalypse.What really surprised me about 'ZombieLand' is that it's in the top 250 list on IMDb.Sure, I enjoyed it, but it's not exactly the best zombie movie ever made.There's still a lot to enjoy in 'ZombieLand'.It's 82 minutes ( without the end credits) of pure fun that's either as good or slightly surpasses 'Shaun of the Dead'.Did I also mention that there's a cameo by Bill Murray? Well, there is and it's one of the surprising things about this movie.I give it a solid 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,18 October 2009

","I just finished watching this movie on the Net and I have to say that this was a very entertaining and heart warming animated movie that will please adults just as much as kids.The characters are stupendous, the animation is great, the plot is convincing, and the overall movie is wonderful.Just wonderful.The movie itself became such a hit that it managed to spawn 2 sequels, the 2nd movie I haven't seen but the 3rd I have seen and enjoyed very much.Out of all of the characters in the movie, my favorite one would probably have to be Scrat.In case you don't know, Scrat is a squirrel who will do anything in order to get his hands on an acorn.Seeing him trying to get an acorn on-screen just makes you want him to be the main character of the whole movie.Nonetheless, 'Ice Age' is a great film for all ages.",9,0,0,24 December 2009
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Good vampire movie,but may be too bloody and disturbing for most people.
","Last night,I went to Fearnet On Demand and decided to watch 'Bram Stokers Dracula'.Besides the long running time,very bloody violence,and some disturbing scenes,this is actually a very well done vampire movie.But people with weak stomachs should definitely take a pass.Heap my warning.This movie is not intended for the weak of heart or stomach.Characters are decapitated,impaled with swords,drained of their blood and 1 character has his throat slit.All of it is shown in graphic detail.There's also a disturbing scene where Dracula gives his vampire wives a baby to feast on.Nothing is shown,but we do see the vampires kneel down towards the infant and,well,you should know what happens.Still,this a well-done horror movie thats worth 122 minutes of your time.Just try not to have nightmares.",8,1,2,10 July 2009
Hancock," My review of the unrated version
","Hancock(Will Smith)is a superhero who drinks too much booze and gets a kick out of insulting people and causing destruction wherever he goes,even though he doesn't do it on purpose.Wanna know how rude he is?He actually takes a guys head and shoves it into another mans rear end,and the result is hilarious.Hancock is a superhero flick with enough humor and great special effects to dazzle just about anyone.I haven't seen the PG-13 version,so I don't know what was added to the unrated version,except the part where Hancock took a prostitute to his trailer and,well,you should know what happens next.Will Smith gives the audience a great performance and doesn't disappoint.Overall score:A-",8,1,2,13 May 2009
Inception," A masterpiece.Simply put, this is one of the best films of the year.
","I knew I was going to like 'Inception' from the start when I watched the trailers and TV spots.When I read the plot online, i was even more excited because I new more about it.And here I am, reviewing one of the best movies of not only the Summer, but of 2010.Christopher Nolan is a master storyteller who knows how to give us a captivating plot and mix it with fascinating special effects and believable characters.It's no surprise that the performances are great.Leonardo DiCaprio was the right choice for his role, as he is with his other movies.It's not just him that brings the movie to life.Ellen Page (Juno) is very good here and Cillian Murphy (Red Eye) gives another mature and powerful performance.I don't think I could think about one feature about this movie that's not as good as the others.Every minute of this 148 minute thrill ride is absolutely dazzling.Oh, and there's the action sequences.What's great about them is that they don't go over the top like Transformers or Shoot Em up.They're not only realistic and convincing, but also exciting and even thrilling at times, and that's rare for a smart action thriller.There you have it, 'Inception' is here and the hype that's been going about is certainly worth it.As I mentioned before, It's probably the best movie of the Summer and one of the best pictures of 2010.Move over Dark Knight, there's another summer blockbuster in town, and it's pretty damn spectacular.",10,2,6,16 July 2010
The Waterboy," Another crude yet funny Adam Sandler film.
","Adam Sandler is a comic genius.He has many funny movies,such as 'Big Daddy', 'I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry',and so on.Although 'The Waterboy'isn't as funny as Adams other movies,it's still pretty funny.Adam stars as Robert Bouchy Jr.,a waterboy who actually enjoys serving water to a football team.But one day,when one of the toughest football players comes over and insults Robert,he unleashes his rage and tackles him.Robert is then offered to become a football player,and he accepts.Talk about turning from a zero to a hero.Anyway,this is a funny and entertaining comedy with enough crude and sexual humor to please fans of Adam Sandler.",7,1,1,1 June 2009
WALL·E," Possibly the best animated film ever
","When I went to see this movie in the theater,I thought it was good but I probably would've given it 7 stars.But,for some reason,when I watched it on DVD,I thought it was excellent.The animation is literally stunning and breath taking.Not only will kids love it,but so will teens,parents,and even grandparents.But there is also a side of romance to the movie that probably won't appeal to young kids.But there's no doubt that they will be pulled into the movie and beg their parents to watch it again.I'm 13 years old and I love this movie.(you don't have to feel ashamed of your age if you liked this movie.)Overall score:10/10 stars.",10,0,2,5 May 2009
Scream," A scream of a classic!!!!!
","Wes Craven is the true master when it comes to mixing horror with comedy and a great cast and great acting.Scream is an excellent example.I didn't find this movie to be too scary or suspenseful,but it's downright fun and sure as hell funny in some parts of the movie.But don't be surprised if this movie seems like a ripoff of other horror movies like 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th'.But in my opinion,I think that 'Scream is way better than the original Halloween(which was also a good movie,but I don't think that its just as good as Scream).I'm 13 years old and this movie is still one of my favorite slasher films.Do you like scary movies?Then I highly recommend this classic film.",9,1,2,26 April 2009
Iron Man," Marvel-ous.
","Robert Downy Jr. is an excellent actor.He's played in many great movies,such as 'Tropic Thunder.'But this is probably his best work yet.'Iron Man'is 117 minutes of pure,adrenaline-rushed excitement packed with terrific action sequences and special effects.There's also some humor.Robert plays Tony Stark,a millionaire who enjoys his life until he's captured by terrorists who force him to build a missile.But Tony doesn't build a missile.He builds an iron suit and escapes.Then the real story begins.Tony upgrades his suit,and uses it fight those who captured him.Thank God that he didn't die or I would've been really mad.Instead he was knocked unconscious after fighting his enemy,who was one of Tony's closest friends.Thank god.",9,2,3,19 May 2009
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Fun for everyone.
","6 hours ago,I went to the movies to catch the 4:40 showing of 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' with my older sister and her boyfriend.I liked the first movie but I haven't seen the second,but that didn't stop me from wanting to see the 3rd installment in the popular series.Boy,am I glad that I spent money and 94 minutes of my life by seeing this.The movie was packed with humor,action,adventure,interesting characters,and even some heart.There are many relationships between characters in this movie that help it from melting.Manny and Ellie are 2 happy woolly mammoths who are expecting a baby.Scrat,the squirrel who continues on his hunt for acorns,meets a female squirrel named Scratee(Scrah-tay),and falls for her.Sid becomes a parent when he discovers 3 eggs underground.In short,I loved this movie.Bring on Ice Age 4",10,42,75,3 July 2009
Speed," Wow!!!!
","Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hooper steal the show in 'Speed',a clever action packed phenomenon that grabs you and won't let go.'Speed' and 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' are the only movies that I have seen that has Keanu Reeves in them,but I intend on seeing his other movies.But anyway,he does an excellent job in this movie,and a slightly better job than 'The Day The Earth Stood Still.'The plot was great.Keanu Reeves stars as a cop who must hijack a bus so it doesn't go under 50 mph,(for those of you who don't know what mph means,it means Miles Per Hour)or it'll blow up.Add in some great action scenes and some interesting characters,and you have a terrific action movie that'll blow your minds.",10,0,1,28 May 2009
Final Destination," Death is all around us.
","'Final Destination' lets us all know that anyone could die at any given moment.I could get shocked to death by the computer while I'm writing this review.Who knows? Maybe I'm going to die today.Devon Sawa plays Alex, a stressed out teenager who just had a vision that the plane he was on was going to explode.He and his friends get off the plane and then the plane blows up.Okay, Alex and his friends are still alive, and nothing can change that, or so they think.One by one, Alex's friends start dying in sometimes grizzly fashions.He later finds out that Death is out to get them.They cheated Death by getting off of the plane before it blew up, but Death is willing to make sure that Alex and his friends get what they deserved.It may sound crazy, but 'Final Destination' is actually a really entertaining thriller packed with suspense and some very interesting moments.Now Death is saving the best for last in 3-D in the latest and upcoming 'Final Destination' movie on August 28.If you're going to see that movie, be sure to see this one and it's 2 sequels first so you won't think the plot is kind of corny.7.5 out of 10.",8,0,1,10 August 2009
Casino," Scorsese strikes again.
","When I saw Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' -which just so happens to be one of my all-time favorite films- I had an urge to see his other movies.I'll agree with pretty much everyone and say that 'Casino' is no 'Goodfellas'.But who cares? This is a fascinating and powerfully dramatic film with great performances by Robert De Niro and the unforgettably talented Joe Pesci who won the Oscar for best supporting actor in 'Goodfellas'. No one can play a more dramatic role and act as dramatic as Pesci.He can blurt the F-word several times non-stop and go absolutely berserk on screen, which really captivated me in 'Goodfellas' and now has done it again in 'Casino'.I'm kinda upset with the movies rating on Yahoo by the film critics.Why and how did this movie get a B- by the critics.Okay, I'm with Roger Ebert on this one and I'm gonna say that it's an absolutely great film.Everyone else can go chop their schlong off and die somewhere.Not as good as 'Goodfellas', but like 'Goodfellas', it's a four-star masterpiece by the legendary Martin Scorsese and I wonder if he'll ever make another mob movie.If he does, I'm there.",10,4,5,12 May 2010
Fantastic Four," Not fantastic, but it's good and campy fun.
","Before I saw this movie on FX(Channel 16), I thought this movie would suck.But I decided to give it a shot.Was I disappointed? No.Is it fantastic? Not quite.Is it a worth-watching action movie? Yes.The movie passed my expectations and had great visual effects and plenty of humor.All of it was handled with class.All of it was handled greatly.All of it was fantastic.If you have read the comic books, then there is absolutely no reason to explain the plot.If you have read the comic books, then there is a reason to tell you that the movie is about 4 people who get superpowers from cosmic radiation.Fantastic, no.Good entertainment, yes.There needs to be a third installment.I'm serious.",8,4,6,17 July 2009
Pineapple Express," What do you get when you take Seth Rogen from 'Knocked Up' and James Franco from 'Spider-Man' and put them into a stoner comedy?
","You get a stoner comedy filled with foul language, extreme violence, and constant use or talk of drugs.Well, it's a stoner comedy so expect everything in it to be graphic.'Pinapple Express' is basically 'Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantamono Bay' meets 'Tango & Cash'. It revolves around two friends who love nothing more than smoking pot.When one of them witnesses a murder, he immediately drives to his apartment and tell his friend what happened.But things get much worse.The murderer finds a joint on the street, and he knows what kind of drug it is.It's Pinapple Express.Now the 2 stoner buddies must stick together and get as far away from their neighborhood as possible.Like most action-comedies, the movie gets even better and better as it continues.If you love Seth Rogen, James Franco, violence, stoner comedies, and action packed stoner comedies, then 'Pinapple Express' is your kind of movie.You'll watch it until it becomes as addictive as pot.",10,4,9,29 July 2009
The Ugly Truth," Entertaining Rom-Com with Katherine Heigl and Gerald Butler.
","Katherine Heigl, you are an excellent and beautiful actress who has many great movies, which include 'Bride of Chucky' and 'Knocked Up'. Gerald Butler, I don't know you very well, but you did an amazing job in this movie.Maybe you should actually consider giving advice on how to get people with a boyfriend or girlfriend.If it worked with Katherine Heigl, it can work with anyone.If there is anything that I can say about you 2 people in this movie, it's that you have done a wonderful job as the main characters.It actually feels like I walked out of the theater with a breath of fresh air.Although this movie isn't excellent, it does deliver plenty of entertainment that fans of Mrs. Heigl and Mr. Butler will just love.In fact, they should do another romantic comedy together.It'll definitely spark some attention between them.I just know it.This movie has a significant similarity to one of the lines in the movie.In the movie, Katherine Heigl said, 'There are no problems, only solutions'. 'The Ugly Truth' is a solution for anyone who has a problem not enjoying romantic comedies.The movie may be a little predictable, but it's still enjoyable.",8,7,19,26 July 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Danny Boyle's latest masterpiece.
","Jamal is an 18-year old who has escaped from the slums of Bumbai when he was younger and has lived in the United Statse for quite some time.From the title, you can probably guess that he gets to play on the show 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' .As he answers the questions correctly, we get to see flashbacks of how he knew the answers.Some people actually thought he cheated.Well, he gets arrested by the police and they play the tape of him answering the questions and he tells them he didn't cheat.As the flashbacks progress along with the movie, we are hit with a film unlike any other.It is a deeply emotional movie that both entertains and rivets with it's sometimes brutality of Bumbai.It may be a lenghty movie,(Running time is 2 hours), but you will be taken away and you will be begging for more once the movie is over.Now I understand about the hype and the 8 Oscars the movie received.Yes, the movie is really good and should definitely be seen by it's targeted and non-targeted audiences.Be sure to stay through the end credits.What's after the movie is a literally breath-taking scene that really makes Danny Boyle a talented director.",9,0,6,17 October 2009
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 'Fly,yes. Land,no.'
","My favorite movie in the Indiana Jones series will always be 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'.But that's not to say that this film isn't good.It is good.In fact,it's terrific.There's plenty of humor,action,adventure,and even a little bit of heart.Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones,like always.If you haven't seen this movie,then you will never guess who plays Indiana's father.I'll give you a hint: He's the man with the golden gun,and his character has 22 movies.So did you find out who plays Indiana's father? Sean Connery.That's right.The man who played James Bond decides not to do another movie about 007 and decides to star in a movie about Indiana Jones.Great cast+humor+action+Steven Spielberg=a great movie",9,1,1,2 July 2009
Goodfellas," 'Goodfellas is a good, good movie.Scratch that, it's a GREAT movie.
","Where do I begin with 'Goodfellas'? How do I start off my review for a movie that is absolutely mind-blowing.A movie that is gritty and dirty, yet beyond entertaining at the same time.Can a movie possibly be this good? When it comes to this movie, it is possible.I was left astonished when the end credits were over.I was left thinking 'Wow! What a great film!'. I am not over-reacting here folks.I am not trying to compete with another movie.I am telling you the truth.If you have not seen this film, then there is no point in talking to you.This Martin Scorsese film is an exhilarating piece of American filmaking that's well directed, well acted, and well constructed.The only other film that I've seen from Martin is 'Shutter Island', which was another great movie, despite what some critics said.I feel that I must warn you: This is an extremely gritty and dirty mafia movie.Swearing and violence run rampant in this film, so viewers who can't stand brutal beatings and four-letter words being uttered out every 5 seconds are going to be in for a depressing experience.But that's not the point.How much do you think the real life Mafia swear and murder? That's what I thought.As explicit this movie is, It's also an Oscar worthy sensation.Joe Pesci really steals the show here.De Nero and Liotta are good, but Pesci brings the thunder here.Do not miss this movie.If you see it on the shelf, but it.Steal it if you have to.Just be sure to witness what may be one of the greatest crime-dramas of all time! No joke.",10,0,0,25 March 2010
Valkyrie," Needed a little more action.
","Before I watched this movie, I was expecting this movie to be an action thriller.But I was disappointed.There was too much drama and too much talking.It's worth watching, but it really doesn't live up to the hype.The movie is basically about a bunch of guys who wanted to stop and kill Adolf Hitler.It's a shame that there are only a few explosions and a lot of gunfire that involves mostly drama than action.Oh, did I mention that this movie was based on a true story? Well, it is.If this movie was supposed to be a thriller and a War movie, then there needed to be at least a couple of battlefield scenes or whatever.If only there was more action.Tom Cruise does deliver a good performance, but if Jason Staham was in this movie, it would've been a non-stop thrill ride.",6,0,0,22 July 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Better than the series!
","I'm not a big fan of the series,even though I do like 'The Simpsons',but when I heard of 'The Simpsons Movie',I was really excited.The movie is basically the same as the show,only it's longer,funnier,and better.Homer Simpson dumps a pig silo with pig crap in it into the Springfield Lake just after Springfield decided not to dump anymore trash into the lake anymore.So the citizens of Springfield form a giant mob and chase Homer and his family out of the town.That's the plot and it gets even better as it continues.Overall,this is an extremely fun movie that will always remain a classic.Take my word and go see 'The Simpsons Movie'with some friends and try not to laugh too hard.You'll be in for 86 minutes of pure entertainment.",9,0,2,23 May 2009
Dodgeball," Vice Vaugn and Ben Stiller steal the show.
","Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, Ben stiller, Rip Torn, and Justin Long star and deliver excellent performances in 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'.It's a witty and funny comedy that takes the actual sport and turns it into an hour and a half of crude humor and slapstick violence, some of it involving dodge ball.One of my favorite characters in this movie would have to be Ben Stiller's character.He may play a very mean and sex crazed man, but he does a hilarious job in this movie and should consider doing more sport comedies.If you like 'Wedding Crashers' with Vince Vaughn and 'Tropic Thunder' with Ben Stiller, then there is no doubt that you will love 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story'.Just remember this:'If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.'",9,0,1,26 August 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Believe the critics.This is a GREAT movie.
","'Law Abiding Citizen' is an excellent look at our court system.It makes us think if criminals like Gerard Butler's character can actually do things that he did in this movie.Me and my friend went to see this movie after watching 'The Stepfather'.My friend had some really high expectations and I can't really say that I did.Sure, it looked good from the trailer, but I had no idea that the film would turn out to be so good.Expect everything that you usually expect from a crime-drama: good acting, great performances, convincing characters, an excellent plot that really stands on it's own, and plenty of twists and turns.Just know that this film is definitely not for the squeamish.With it's brutal torture scene and graphic violence, you will feel as if you were the victim of the killer.Overall, This is a definite must-see thriller that you should enjoy if you like Geraerd Butler and Jaime Foxx's work.9.5/10",10,1,13,17 October 2009
