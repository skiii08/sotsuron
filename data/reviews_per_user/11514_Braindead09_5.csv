Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Downey Jr, as this years leading lady
","To tell us that the opening stage of the film is set in London, we get a shot of workmen digging a hole to tell us that commencement of an underground system is underway. It made me physically laugh out loud that how one of London's greatest achievements was noted this way.The actual film itself is a romp that is more style than content and uses a lot of Guy Richies tricks of the trades and yep he overdoes the fast editing, slow motion and flashbacks to the point of tedium. What can't be faulted is that he got another OK performance out of Britain's blandest leading man Jude Law, who for once seemed to utter two words in a row without looking as though he was distracted from his cue cards. The Jack Sparrowisms of Downey's Holmes is again entertaining and the one true thing that was captured in this film was how awful Holmes disguises are, Richie deliberately showed us that his skull caps are painted pigs leather with stuck on hair and dotted stubble.Stephen Fry excels as Mycroft and it was brave of him to show us what a 50 year old naked man does look like from the groin up. It was a shame that Captain Tanner and the Baker Street Boys are only glimpsed at in the last couple of minutes and Eddie Marsan is not given more of a role as Inspector Lestrude.The females Kelly Reilly, Noomi Rapace and Rachael MacAdams are underused and the actual leading lady was Robert Downey Jr went topless.Listen out for a piece of Ennio Morriocone music from 'Two Mules For Sister Sarah' as Holmes is seen travelling after his requests for a bicycle are not met.The film is not a waste of time, but two are enough. Yes I have helped feed the monster called Hollywood and my pennies along with other could tot up and I suspect a third outing will appear. Maybe time for a reboot and have the fun of Rathbone, with the aloofness of Jeremy Brett and the budget of Warner Bros without all the bits of gimmickry included for Guy Richie's toolbox",7,4,13,16 December 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Should make the break from The Office
","A romantic comedy that actually works. Steve Carell picked a good enough script to convince me that maybe leaving The Office is not career suicide. The plot plays like a French farce. The break-up is delivered immediately and the audience are allowed to watch Steve Carell and Julianne Moore as a middle aged couple work their way through the situation. OK Moore is placed as the villain, but its not hard to believe that she had a do or stay mission. The film doesn't lag and though the actual time span is difficult to gage, we are spared the stereotypical scenes of weeping maladjusted children playing cupid. The son is only interested in his own agenda and only lets rip about his parents marriage with his synopsis of The Scarlet Letter.The plot contrivances were pleasantly delivered on their premise and Marisa Tomei carried her performance with a vengeful glint in her eye right up until her final scene. Thankfully Kevin Bacon short appearance worked, even though his characters pursuit of a married woman was morally dubious his heart seemed to be in the right place.I enjoyed the subplot with the 13 year old son and his crush on the babysitter and thought it ended on both a sweet and disturbing note.The only false note was the late revelation of Emma Stone background. This was more than made up for with her first night with Ryan Gosling as he experienced the joy of a woman for company instead of a sperm deposit.Ryan Gosling was able to give his friendless character a lot of charm, and when the film needed to make a plot leap it worked well enough to take Steve Carell on his journey.Overall easily this years second best dysfunctional rom com after Bridesmaids.",Null,0,1,23 September 2011
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Watch the film, don't let the reviewers undermine your entertainment.
","I must have watched a different film to the other reviewers giving it low scores.It's not a perfect film, but at 140 minutes the film zips along at a frantic pace jumping from one set piece to another with nods to the original trilogy and cameos. In a world where every piddling film is released an event, this one is an event.The film suffers the same problem as others in all the films we don't get the scale of time and distance, every one appears to cross the galaxy with ease, but there again it's a space fantasy not a film about logistics.I have had the privilege of seeing this series over 42 years, and yep it struggled in the middle series but can honestly say I was satisfied with this film, wether the actors can build careers outside of this film is going to be interesting.If you are watching the film for the sake of ticking it of the list, maybe give it a miss that way the nay sayers on here can win their battle. If you want to see how this cycle ends go watch it, ignore the negativity and go along for the riddStick through the credits and you get to hear John Williams score.",8,10,25,19 December 2019
Sultan," give blood
","On Meerkat Wednesday I took the jump and watched this film. I was dreading it normally in this town the audiences for films listed as Bollywood they just talk and shout all the way through, only going quite when the songs play. Luckily there was only three people in the screen including me.The film was a good three hours of Indian film making at its best. The simple script did not rely on an abundance of dance numbers, whistling sound effects and the brain damaged best friend. The juvenile antics of the thirty something Salman Khan chasing fallen kites was a well edited race and gave a good introduction to his love interest Anushka Sharma. The film played like a Rocky film set in the world of wrestling as a series of training scenes and fights followed the growing relationship between the two leads. The cockiness of Salman and the tragedy that befalls him works to a hard hitting end of the first half. The second half working against this tragedy introduces a new cast and story line to this film and offers plenty of bone crunching fights in the ring. The songs in this film actually work and for a change does not slow down the pacing its almost 3 hour running time. The bright airy world of small town India in the first half contrasts nicely against the dark urban world of Delhi in the second half. The director/writer Ali Abbas Zafar does a good job and this film easily falls into the top 20 films I've seen this year. Even the credit crawl doesn't waste time it fills the viewer in on the near future for the main characters.",8,2,3,20 July 2016
Thor," Thor $150 million
","According to IMDb, this film cost $150 million to make, surely after 20 years plus of CGI becoming and essential element of the film production process surely these films could look as though they cost that much money.There were elaborate cityscapes and tron line flashing bridges, the failing of this film though is it looks cheap. The ice monster, is nothing spectacular.Like Flash Gordon (1980)it has enough action and OK actors to distract the eye and mind from thinking wow this is a tatty looking film for the majority of the time. Seeing Ray Stephenson beard made me think director Kenneth Branagh wanted to cast Brian Blessed in the role and make Thor his homage to Flash Gordon.Luckily I saw the film in 2D, and it was an enjoyable romp. Maybe the stereoscopic version added something to it for fans of 3D but I don't think I missed anything special in that department.The plot and background is bare bones, I suspect there are more than a few minutes of deleted scenes, the cinema patron will have to pay to see or even an extended cut on DVD/BLu Ray Considering this film is set in the same universe as Iron Man,Hulk etc surely its time that people started to focus on the doppleganger of Stan Lee who regulalrly crops up and can surely no longer be classed as cameo appearances.Stay patient enjoy the Foo Fighters closing tune, read the credits for 5 minutes and the viewer will be rewarded",8,1,7,27 April 2011
