Casablanca," Classic American Cinema
","Strictly speaking Casablanca is not about WW 2. It is not about living in a foreign land and not knowing if you will ever get to a better place. It is also not necessarily a love story, at least not in the sense that it is about whether or not to people will fall in love and end happily ever after. At it's core Casablanca is about the effect that two people can have on each other and what effect the crossing of two paths can do. In almost every conceivable way Casablanca was one of the best technical cinematic works ever made. Every shot was elegant and extremely thought out. Weather it was a scene with one person in a dark room or a crowded street in the bright of day, nothing is out of place. Nothing is over or under done. While the story is well done it is also, in a way, boiler plated. I don't mean to say this negatively, rather as a complement to how timeless this story truly is. It could conceivably happen anywhere or any time in history. With all this said, I believe the most compelling and significant part of this movie is how it helped vault the American cinema to the top of the world.",8,0,3,18 October 2010
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," amazing on screen chemistry makes up for terrible post production.
","This film is classic Paul Newman. If you have never seen him act start here. Robert Redford is amazing. The duo is deadly hilarious. The back and fourth between them makes this movie what it is. The comedy helps drive this movie that is based in the traditions of a genera that has mostly lost it's audience. This movie has amazing acting from the entire cast and is entertaining all the way through. There are multiple classic Hollywood western gun battles. Each scene is shot beautifully in the wild frontier, not giving up a single detail. One thing that takes away from the movie is the music. it is often un appropriate for the scene or is distracting from what is happening on the screen. If you can get past the music the film becomes a lot better. The one thing that stands out the most in my mind and makes this movie one of the greats is the chemistry between Redford and Newman. seeing the two of them on screen together makes this movie an instant classic that i will continue to watch for the rest of my life.",7,0,0,26 November 2010
The Grapes of Wrath," Amazingly compelling movie
","This film is a shining example of John Ford's directing prowess. 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a ripped for the history books example of life in the 1930's Midwest. Henry Fonda has an amazingly compelling performance as Tom Joad, an ex-con returning home to his family of sharecroppers. When the company repossesses the land, the family must move where they can hope they can find work. The film takes a very naturalistic lighting approach which magnifies the performances given by the cast. I have never read the original novel by John Steinbeck, but this work put together by John Ford sets itself apart to stand on it's own merit. The film takes on a subject matter that was still very fresh in the minds of the American public. John Steinbeck who won numerous awards for his work, including the Noble Prize for Literature (1962) also was graced with the honer of being one of the first authors to have their successful book be turned into an equally successful movie.",8,0,1,14 November 2010
