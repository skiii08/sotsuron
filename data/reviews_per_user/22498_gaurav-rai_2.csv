Captain Phillips," A nail-biting thriller with lead's towering performance!
","Cinema creates drama. Drama that drives you to cry when a couple in love gets separated, to laugh at someone's idiotic misery, to amaze with the power of imagination, to get transported in to a world full of dreams or to be in situation that is just a recreation of a real life event but carries same share of intensity and anxiety characters might have experienced it in real.Based on a true story, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS by notable filmmaker Paul Greengrass (the man behind 'Bourne' movies) throws you in a 'pressure cooker' situation where every passing minute escalates the tension in same manner the crew of American Cargo ship MV Maersk Alabama could feel, when Somali pirates invade to hijack.With an implicit fear of the same, the cool-calm-composed but aging Captain Rich Phillips (played by the enormously gifted Tom Hanks) starts his sailing but soon in the middle of a mock-drill session, smells the alarming possibility of getting hijacked by pirates. Sadly, he fails to stop them from getting on board but never lets go the string of hope and courage for even an iota of a second, to come out of this misery of his lifetime.10-12 minutes in the film and you know what is going to happen next but the way Greengrass unfolds the story with an intimidating sense of 'what is coming after' and the smartly edited inter-cuts between the ship and the pirate-group, you would always find yourself on edge of the seat with nails between your teeth. The camera-work effectively roams around for shaky close-up shots to give the narration an anxious-panicky-edgy feel and does a brilliant job while capturing the hijacking event. Though in the second part, film falls into being restricted & repetitive with the location of the story getting narrowed to one small life-boat, the anxiety-angst & intensity never go for the toss.As other but very prominent strength of the film, the casting and the performances excite you the most. Barkhad Abdi as the gruesome-ghastly leader of the pirate-group plays mostly an underdog in the first part. With his regulated look, you actually never recall his first appearance in the film but later when he arises as the spearhead of the group, he shocks you with his performance. So does Mr. Tom Hanks, his calculated act as a captain determined to save and safe his crew is remarkable. Watch him in the last act where he is rescued by the armed forces and is now dealing with the trauma he's been in. A performance that deserves appreciation!CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is easily the year's one of the best thrillers coming from Hollywood. It's a well-directed, intensely acted, smartly written inspiring tale of survival that keep you engaged and involved for the most part. A must-watch!",8,0,3,22 October 2013
Gravity," 3D gets a new dimension!
","Days are not quite out of sight when the human race will have residential colonies on extraterrestrial zero-gravity space stations but in its own time. And till the time, when advanced science & the technology constantly making head ways in getting breakthroughs achieve that, we have another power to experience what may suggest the future in its own waythe vision to create, replicate, reproduce and design the 'dream-come-true' ultramodern set-up into another brilliant piece of art never less than the predicted and the expected one.For Alfonso Cuaron's sci-fi thriller GRAVITY (3D), adjectives like breathtaking, heart-pounding, awe-inspiring, spine-chilling, nail-biting are not merely some words mentioned in the phrase book but an experience at large. Or else you can say that these words look just plain simple formation of random alphabets when the jaw-dropping visuals of GRAVITY happen to you in the most extraordinary way that has never been tried before. It's 'out of the world' in literal and every sense.In an unpredictably splendid scenic celestial beauty, when the crew of a space-shuttle undergoes with a critical accident caused by destruction in another satellite, 2 crew-members find themselves detached from their space-stations to float around in the vast environs of zero gravity world. Oxygen level is dropping down persistently. Connections to the base are lost. Hopes are the only survival instinct. Undying Spirit is the only way out. But aren't these the rules of earth they have left long way down?Filtering GRAVITY to extract one hero, to credit its success in the name of, will not be an achievable choice. Camera-work that makes you believe what all you see is never done in a comparatively tiny little studio covered in green, is absolutely picturesque and mesmerizing. Watch out for the opening sequence of a 10-12 min long one shot and you will be submerged into thoughts that how could they even think of it. Visual effects and the 3D technology have really gone beyond expectations. They don't just make you jump or cringe into your seats for the sake of it but they grab & grasp you firmly to enjoy every bit of it like you are in there in all of your flesh and with your entire soul.Oscar award winner Sandra Bullock earns all your emotions to be with her character in all good and bad times. Her commitment to excel is very much visible through her emoting muscles and in physical appearances also. George Clooney plays an 'out and out' charismatic astronaut who, even in the worst case scenario, doesn't lose his calm and the pleasurable flirtatious attitude. Don't miss the softer moments between themof love 'in no air'.After Stanley Kubrick's philosophical sci-fi drama '2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY', this is the most astonishing 90-min long trip to space, no one should give a miss. I am not sure how many of us will make it to the futuristic space-colonies in their lifetime but here's a chance to live your dreams like never done before. Watch it in IMAX 3D if you have the privilege!",9,4,6,22 October 2013
