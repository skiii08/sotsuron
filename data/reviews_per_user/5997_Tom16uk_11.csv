Alien 3," Great action and suspense, but poor script and acting
","To see this film, its likely you've seen the previous 2 films, which were very good. Horror fans wouldn't be disappointed with this film, but the acting and script lets it down. Alien 3 has never lived up to its previous films to some people, including me. The director of Alien 3 - David Fincher, unfortunately tries to make the film more modern than its predecessors. This is were the film goes wrong. We are used to the excellent directing delivered to us in the previous films, but the only good piece of directing in this film are the camera angles, which shows us the aliens nicely and some great 'running away' scenes which we see when the characters try to trap an alien, cleverly in one small area. The best of use of cameras in this film is the quiet scene in which Ripley finds the mother alien sneaking up on her.The film is set on a distant planet that holds some insane characters in a prison. Ripley, in her escape pod from the previous film, lands onto the planet. Here, we meet many strange and different characters of all types. We have our typical American psychopath who keeps on shouting out 'F**k you man!'. Its a shame really, the first film done well without guys like this. I'm not saying actors shouldn't swear - what do you expect with an alien hunting you down, but I get the impression they are saying it for the hell of it. Then we get some dumb geezers who apparently haven't seen a woman in years - believable, but if you class Ripley as a woman by the end of this film, you belong with these guys! Our other characters thankfully try to act and remain calm...most of the time.After an alien is swallowed by the riggers dog, he (spoiler) gets frisky and gives birth to an alien, but because the dog ate the egg, we see an alien mutated into a dog. A clever idea from our novice director, and a realistic scene when we see the dogs stomach explode. The other special effects aren't too bad either. We see CGI (computer generated images) of aliens, running around the corridors that maybe perhaps could have done with more effort.It is Ripleys change in personality that sets this film away from the previous 2. Its harsh , but (spoiler) when Ripley gets her hair shaved off to avoid lice, she does become very mannish. It is the truth, but its shows the development in Ripleys character. She is no longer the woman with plenty of femininity, but now a more woman who's ready to kick some ass.The good thing about this film is the amount of action we are treated to! There's plenty of 'run away' scenes and aliens, and the realism is great - most scenes use puppets of aliens, and the use of the early CGI is minimal, so don't worry about that too much.If your looking for a realistic action film, than try Alien 3. it has its flaws - bad script, lack of outer space, and constant arguments between the characters that gets tedious. But this film has been designed for action, and director David Fincher does a good job of that, and the puppet realism as well. But avoid this if you don't like lots of blood, aliens, or the flaws listed above.Overall, an experience.",6,1,3,22 December 2004
Batman Returns," All round its perfect, one of the best. You can't fault it
","Any Batman fan will know just how great the films are, they've been a major success. Batman Returns however is by far the best film in the series. A combination of excellent directing, brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in.Tim Burton, who directed this movie, has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he's done a great job. Danny Devito (Penguin man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grown up to become a hideous and ugly...thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing 'Catwoman' after cats had given her there genes from being bitten. The result in both the character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is great fun to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital, and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives.You can't forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side to Batman. His affection is let loose when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when she's a normal person, Selina Kyle, result in him being seduced badly in his own home. There's a clever part after this when they leave, and the film is full of great scenes. Its worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat mobile is not used as much as in the other Batman films, as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film.The winter setting is created perfectly in Gotham City with most of the scenes being set at night, and with the town being filled with snow. Therefore, if you watch this film during the summer like I have, it doesn't feel the same. Best watch it during the winter.Overall, its an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they've done an incredible job.",10,3,7,25 May 2005
The Terminator," 100% classic stuff.
","The Terminator has everything - action, romance, slight humour and a brilliant storyline. The reason the story line is so good, is because unlike a lot of films these days, this film could become a reality. The idea of machines and computers taking over our world is a definite possibility, as they will indeed become cleverer than us. (fact)But getting back to the film, the special effects are what most caught my eye. Indeed, by todays standards using stop motion animation (plasticine models moved one frame at a time) is dated, but I feel this made the film seem scarier some how. Just seeing the T-101 's endoskeleton walking down the corridor at the cyberdyne factory sends shivers down my spine, because the animation looks so scary - a brilliant piece of directing by James Cameron. This is were Terminator 3 failed, because the CGI (computer generated images) just isn't scary. One things for sure, you can't beat hand produced special effects, and Stan Winston has done a stunning job. in both T1 and T2.Of course, this film has some great acting in it as well. Micheal Biehn does a good job of not being able to adapt to 1984. What I like is the good choice of actors. Neither the character Kyle Reese or Sarah Connor are absolute superstars that have glamorous looks, and thats why Cameron chose them. He made us see how the character of Sarah Connor could have happened to any one. (providing they have an unborn son, as you'll see in the film)And as Sarah keeps asking herself in the film 'why me?' Cameron doesn't need to unravel an answer, but suggests that she is just a normal citizen, who has been given this terrible ordeal. But in kyle Reese's (Micheal Biehn) eye, she is very important.Cameron uses some good directing techniques, especially with the music. The theme tune has a simple electronic style to it, but it stays in you head for ages! But for a low budget movie, music composer Brad Fiedel does a great job, mixing tension, with classic piano music in the scene were Sarah and kyle spend a bit of time 'in bed'. The piano music immediately reminded me of the piano music used in Titanic. So it seems Cameron hasn't lost his touch for music.By the 2 disc special edition DVD to get extra features, including commentary, trailers, 'the making of T1' and some deleted scenes, which I have been puzzled why there were deleted. One shows some FBI or special agents removing the terminators main chip right at the end, and slips it inot his pocket, explaining how it got to the cyberdyne factory in T2.You really can't fault this film. For a low budget film, its been put together simply and the outcome is great.",9,0,1,20 December 2004
Alien," The brilliant start to a brilliant saga
","There aren't that may films made in the seventies that I actually like, but this is probably one of the best. This is a sci-fi thriller with some memorable moments.Director Ridley Scott is already showing us how spooky space can be just from the opening cast list. Indeed no-one can here you scream, and this silent filming method prepares us for many of our characters to (spoiler) be killed by the deadly Alien, leaving Ripley on her own...Sigourney Weaver plays the character 'Ripley' in this film, who is part of a group of crew members aboard a mining spaceship. The space ship interior looks great, and director Scott keeps the corridors dark to build up tension. After receiving an SOS call, the crew of the space ship land on a strange planet where they find thousands of what seem to be eggs. It would be harsh to spoil this films to the people unfortunate not to see it, but poor old John Hurt has a terrible death when a small, baby alien pops out of his stomach. I say 'pops out' because new comers will want the surprises. The small Alien very funnily zooms across the kitchen floor in the spaceship, where all the crew members are left in silence, with a new addition to their crew, an alien!Its great to see that no CGI was used in this film, as I have explained that pure realism can't be beaten by hand made special effects in many other reviews. All the aliens in this film were produced using puppets and models, which look fantastic. I love the way you see the aliens acid spill out their moths on the close up shots, and the shiny, silver teeth. The acting is good and is probably the best performance we see of Sigourney weaver in the alien series, as unfortunately, by the time we get to alien3, its all getting a bit too much with the constant 'F**k you, man!. There's just no need for it. Alien is a film to enjoy because of the excellent directing, like The terminator. The sounds are great, camera angle are good, and its a memorable flick.",9,1,3,21 December 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Don't fix something that isn't broken.
","Instructions on how to fix something that isn't broken: 1. Take 2 amazing films. 2. Take the plot and storyline. 3. Take the FINISHED story and try to CONTINUE it with a rubbish excuse 4. Take away lots of violence so that it can be rated '12A' 5. Include some un-scary CGI scenes and acting 6. Make too many jokes an take away the seriousnessYour outcome.. Terminator 3. Its hard to know where to start. Lets get the good pints out first. Kristianna Loken, who plays the T-X - a part machine, part liquid metal robot that makes Arnie, the T-101 look 'obsolete'. Loken does an excellent job an takes the character really well. I think thats the only good point.. Flaws fill this film from start to finish. You can partly blame the new directing that has modernised this film too much, and turned it into some scenes as a joke. Their are no gloomy, well filmed fight sequences as in the previous 2 films, and the jokes in this film are quite utterly poor. The worst idea of the lot was at the start, where Arnie (T-101) walks into a bar and gets his clothes of a gay stripper. Oh dear.. And it gets worse wen he walks out of the bar and puts on a pair of pink sparkly star glasses. Are we honestly expected to believe that a super-intelligent robot, with a database of millions of facts an information would put on these glasses? Thankfully, he sees sense and stamps on them. A slow start to a slow film. Their are plenty more of these stupid jokes, but lets avoid them. The fight sequences are actually not bad - you sense the feeling neither robot will win as they go on for long times. However, the CGI lets the sequences down a little, as with many parts of this film. In Terminator 1, you could become scared through stop-motion animation and real props and makeup. I'm afraid computers seem to have replaced that. No longer do you get shivers down your spine, but more of a sense to laugh. The only good CGI sequence is were the T-X transforms from being Katherines boy friend to her normal self. Its a really realistic scene, and shows what we can achieve in the special effects department. But there's a point you just have to stop. Whats more, this film shouldn't have even been made! In terminator 2, all the computer chips were destroyed along with Cyberdyne. Therefore its impossible to continue the saga. Nooo, because Arnie has a perfect excuse; 'Judgement was inevitable'. More like 'I wanted more money, just like the film company and the box office'. I'm sure everyone got enough money when the film was produced to be rated a 12, so it just so happens that adults and kids can watch it, equalling more sales. You could analyse more problems with this film all day, all I have done is picked out the big ones. For any Terminator lovers that enjoyed the previous film, you may feel almost embarrassed. For first time watchers, you will probably enjoy, as you have not seen the quality in the previous films. The only way to enjoy the whole Terminator saga is to not watch this movie.",5,6,12,24 August 2005
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The quality and Oscars makes this one of the best sequels ever
","Forget all your techno-babble films like the disappointing Matrix revolutions, if your looking for a good sci-fi / action thriller, then look no further. T2 Judgement day has all the makings of a classic film. It not only incorporates wonderful special effects, but some great acting and clever scenes. As a sequel to the classic 'The Terminator' this goes beyond all barriers and delivers us a memorable sequel.With the amount of films out today that include supposed 'Extreme special effects' and 'ground breaking realism', we feel we should be in for a treat. I guarantee you, that nearly 90% of the films we see nowadays have at least a little bit of CGI. The problem - It just isn't real. Terminator 2, a film made over 12 years ago, could easily pass in the cinemas today being presented as a new film. Why? Because its so realistic. Robert Patrick plays this films villain, a new terminator called a T-1000, with shape shifting and liquid metal capabilities. Patrick doesn't an outstanding job acting as a cyborg. He is able to become a non-stopping killing machine, that just doesn't give up and also has the glamour of being able to become very human. A humorous small scene(only available only ULTIMATE EDTION) see's Patrick walk up to Policeman on his bike and say 'Say, thats a nice bike.' We obviously know what happens next, as we see Patrick on the bike later on.Patrick is also capable of meeting the demands of receiving shotgun wounds from the (spoiler), now, good guy Arnie! Arnie has been set out by John Connor in the future war to protect the young John from the deadly T-1000. Arnie plays an important role in this film, as we see him become the good guy, a total contrast from the first film.he delivers a good performance, and acts well to show that he doesn't understand human emotions. There's a cracking scene on the ULTIMATE EDITION were we see Arnie trying to impersonate a man smiling. He fails at it, and puts on his firm hard-looking face.But with all the film being good so far, surely their must be a downer? Well, the only downer I guess is the way Sarah Connors character has transformed from the first film. She is no longer the woman in distress, but she is now a tough cookie, ready for some action after working out in her cell in the Mental Asylum. Her 'hard knock' attitude does get a bit annoying and disappointing, but it can't be helped because her character is simply developing.Stan Winston helps develop this excellent performance. He had designed and help produce the endoskeletons in the new future war scene, designed the bullet impact effects for the T-1000, which were cleverly done using spring loaded foam. His cleverness has helped to make this film great. His crafty hands were also needed to help produce the nuclear blast scene. This is a very disturbing scene, which I prefer to skip when watching the DVD. Its disturbing as (spoiler) its shows how Sarah Connor is burnt to death during an imagined nuclear blast, along small children in a playground. Realistic, but disturbing.The sounds are also great! Makes the bullet impacts on the T-1000 so realistic is the sound effect. The main title score for the film is the same tune, excepted extended and made using slighty more modern synthersisers. The best us of music is probably at the end, where you'll be on the edge of your seat, amazed at the excellent use of CGI!If you've seen the first film, or are looking for an entertaining film, choose Terminator 2 - Judgement day and you won't be disappointed.",10,0,0,21 December 2004
Aliens," Saying this is brilliant is an understatement.
","Sequels don't come better than this. Aliens has all the makings of a classic sci-fi film - plenty of action, suspense, and excellent special effects thats makes it a must.This is one of those classic films, made in the eighties were you feel everyone except you have watched it. I felt the same at once. But now I know why people went to see it. James Cameron does an excellent job in continuing the Alien saga, from 1979. In this fine instalment, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has now escaped from the disaster back in the first film, and luckily, her escape pod docks with a large space centre, where she is saved. Marines want to (Spoiler) go back to the planet LV-426, not knowing that it is infested with deadly Aliens. A small colony of people living on this planet lose contact with Ellen's new friends, and the Marines have an excuse to check the planet out, with Ripley accompanying them. The Marines don't realise the battle that awaits them.... Stan Winston, the special effects creator of other hits like Terminators 1 and 2, does a stunning job to make the Aliens look real in this film. He combines animotronics with puppets and other effects to deliver an exceptionally real film, which backs the debate that using puppets and animotronics is far better than CGI (computer generated images). The most impressive use of puppets is the 'mother alien' as seen towards the end of the film, which is very realisticThe acting is also up to scratch. Weaver plays a good part, still playing her heroic role, whilst at the same time, being a caring guardian to the character 'Newt', a little girl who is a survivor of the disappearing colonies. Bil Paxton, also seen in the mixed reviewed Titanic, plays a good character, being a slightly eccentric soldier of the Marines. As ever, he plays a good role. Three characters from the Terminator saga are also included in this film - Micheal Biehn teams up with Sigourney Weaver in parts, and we get hints that they love each other, but its not to be. Lance Henriksen plays a good android who (Spoiler) is an improved model from the one on Ripleys ship in the first film. And finally, Jenette Golstein plays a tough Marine and says one of the best comebacks to an insult I've ever heard:Paxton: 'Have you ever been mistaken for a man? Goldstein: 'No, have you?Overall, this film doesn't disappoint. It is not as long and drawn out as Alien, and delivers plenty of action. Overall, Its a hit!",8,0,0,11 January 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Ignore the 'naysayers', this is a good film!
","Lots and lots of people are giving this film bad reviews for many reasons. What they fail to understand is... 1. The directing is superb 2. The CGI is surprisingly very realistic 3. The atmosphere and settings are greatIts true, this is a good. Finally after years of waiting, I cant say i'm disappointed, its a great face-off movie that truly shows what the Aliens and predators are like when there battling. What struck me first about this movie was the excellent CGI. In normal circumstances, were used to seeing poor effects in films these days, but the effects in this film are ultra realistic, and had to be used to make scenes where the Aliens and Predators get flung through walls!The dark and dull setting of the Aztec Pryamid is great and builds up tension and suspense well, combined with the good directing that reveals where the Aliens are lurking around. I have to say though, its the Aliens that really make this movie. The props are make them look as though there real, and the close camera shots of its acid-dripping mouth are cleverly done, and taken from this first Alien film, as many other little scenes have been taken from Predator and Alien films. The lack of blood and gore is a straight notice as well - I guess the reason being because of the movie people wanted to keep the age limit down (tut tut), and this is a problem you have noticed with Terminator 3, a 12? What were they thinking? A 12 year old won't have seen the previous Terminator films!The way the characters combine with the Aliens and Predators is great. I have to say though, it was strange at first to see (spoiler) Sanna being helped by the Predator later in the film, and it even makes you feel sorry for the Predator (uh oh) when it dies at the end. the film length was also a bit odd. The extended version, available on the basic DVD is just 1 hour 26 minutes long, so how long the normal version is I would worry about..But with these niggles aside, its good entertainment - less blood and gore as in the films Predator and Aliens admittedly, but you don't need that to make a good film like this, which is what many people have failed to pick up. I would say watch it if you've seen the Alien and Predator saga's, and you'll be entertained.",8,8,14,27 May 2005
Meet the Fockers," Excellent sequel to the great first film
","Meet the parents was already a great film, the wacky characters and jokes that appeared entertained us all. Meet the fockers, the sequel, has taken the story of the 2 families to a new level.Gaylords parents are the 2 new characters in this film, as new jokes are combined with hints of the previous film - Jack still stands by his 'circle of trust' and the film ties in neatly with its predecessor. The basic plot is that Byrnes family now have the opportunity to visit Gaylords wacky parents, but there not impressed. Jack is still up to his old tricks with Gaylord, as he attempts to make him tell the truth with a special injection in one great scene, and his hidden cameras are still lurking. The appearances of Gaylords parents are a definite relief. Their wacky and laid back attitude towards life is very amusing, and the way their personalities are a total contrast to the Byrnes family is great.With jokes from the first film, and new ones,you've gotta watch this if you have seen the first movie, it just gets better!",8,0,0,13 May 2005
Toy Story," Great fun for anyone
","Toy Story is definitely a film that a kid should watch before they are a teen. Its adventure and great sense of humour is appealing to adult audiences as well, and the atmosphere is brilliant. This really is a Toy Story. The plot is indeed quite simple, and it would have to be for a classic family. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks)is a toy 'sheriff' doll, owned by a young boy called Andy. Woodys Toy life couldn't as Andy loves him a lot, but as Andy's birthday party arises tension fills the bedroom with each toy living in fear of being replaced. Everything goes well till the last birthday present is opened.. enter Buzz Lightyear!I would be criminal to tell you the rest of the story, but as far as humour and adventure are concerned, this film impresses in both categories. The toys different personalities really contrast and make you laugh, from the smart-chat of Mr. Potatoe head, to Slinky who is Woodys best toy friend. Its so easy to follow this film - the plot and characters are easy to watch the computer graphics are top notch. Compared to modern day CGI kids films, this stands out purely because of its innocence - a simple story, theirs no techno-babble, and its really fun. This truly is the film of the Nineties!",9,0,0,18 September 2005
Platoon," This is a 'real' film, and its excellent
","I don't think I've ever watched a film that depicts a real life situation as good as this. It is a rare film in that it is complete - the acting, music, setting and directing are all superb and create an amazingly realistic atmosphere. From watching this film, you will not only be entertained, but you will learn what life was like during the Vietnam War. In case you haven't already heard, Platoon is a war film that presents us with a day-by-day account of young Charlie Sheen, who is struggling to fit in with a group of soldiers, all much older than him. As you should know, the Vietnam war lasted many years and soon became a problem for the American society when the media found out the truth, and as Walter Kronkite, the news reader said 'What the hells going on? I thought we were winning this war!' (Nope, my gcse in history ain't coming out) But this film concentrates on how the soldiers were feeling, and reacting to the war. Oliver Stone who directed this film put the actors through their paces by actually making them survive in real soldier conditions, were they had to dig there own homes, avoid sleeping on watch duty, and much more. It proved a treat as all the acting in this looks as though the war had started again. Normally at this point, I would comment on the films special effects, but I've got a break because this film just uses very realistic warfare weapons to create the big war scenes. You would think this would make it a preety low budget movie, but when you see the attention to detail, it must have a long film to shoot. This is a great film, but not for the faint hearted. As you would expect from a realistic film, there is lots of blood and 'gorey wound' scenes. And again there's a lot of shooting, the saddest part being when the platoon of troops shoot down a group of innocent villagers due to frustration. Overall, this is a great film. Good acting and great surroundings combine with a theme tune that will never escape your head its that sad and catchy, just like the film.",8,2,4,24 June 2005
