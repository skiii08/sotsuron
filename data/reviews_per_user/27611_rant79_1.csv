Requiem for a Dream," a work of art that will floor you...
","I'm not going to write a spoiler review for this,(although I usually do) simply because I want you to see this film!!!(by the way, avoid Hollywood Video and Blockbuster-they're carrying edited versions because apparently the film as Aronofsky intended it is 'too disturbing').All I can say in an effort to keep this brief is that once again Mr. Aronofsky has produced a movie that is TRULY mesmerizing-as with Pi, I was unable to turn away for a second(even on some of the more graphic scenes - once you see it you will know what i'm referring to). Regardless of your stance on the drug issue, this is the true picture of heroin addiction-there is no room here for debate on whether it 'glorifies heroin' like some people tried to with Trainspotting(which i didn't understand-how could Trainspotting possibly depict a glamorous life as a junkie??? come on!!! oh yeah that really looks like fun when Renton attempts to retrieve his pills!)ANYHOW I am without a doubt going to purchase this on DVD-it amazes me how much Aronofsky manages to completely immerse you in the story line, and rip your heart out without resorting to contrived Hollywood standbys of cute kids and the like. Some may complain this movie is graphic - yeah well that's REAL. The sheltered, ignorant masses of suburbia need to get a good idea of what absolute hell some people experience in their lives-and that it's not just the 'messed up youth of today' that have problems. You especially have to appreciate the depth of characters that is developed in order to give the viewer a feel of WHY people end up doing things like this to themselves.",10,0,0,10 July 2001
