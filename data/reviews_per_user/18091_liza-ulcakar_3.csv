Black Swan," Simply perfect
","In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever made....let me correct my mistake; it's perfect. I've always loved psychic dramas, especially those by Aronofsky. You can say about Black Swan anything you want, and I do understand if you think it's stupid and absurd, because it's just not made for everyone. I am one of those who understood this movie and its message. I loved the way the main character Nina Sayers slowly drifts into paranoia and changes into the black swan. The second time I watched it I noticed that the 'Swan lake' story actually took place in her own life; she was weak and fragile (White Swan) meanwhile her choreographer wanted to draw the dark, the fearless and the passionate side of her (I loved how she progressively started to wear darker clothes ending with total black). At the end he finally wins and gets her Black Swann side. Eventually the White Swan dies (just like in the story).Nina sayers wanted to be perfect, as she eventually was, and so was the movie; acting was perfect, music was perfect, effects were perfect, the way it was filmed, the story was perfect, the clothing was perfect, makeup was perfect, everything was perfect.",10,1,2,9 August 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Absolutely Amazing!
","So, yeah...wow! Excellent movie! I was expecting another Juno but I got something totally different. I mean, don't get me wrong; i absolutely loved Juno but this movie is so much more; filled with humor and emotional depth. When I started watching, I thought that it's just another teenage movie but I immediately changed my mind. It's not just a love story, but a story of being an outcast and, accepting yourself and dealing with your past. I think that The Perks of Being a Wallflower casts true light on how hard it is being a teenager.'We accept the love we think we deserve'...Oh, my God! I'm totally in love with this quote. I never thought of it that way but after seeing this movie, I think that this sentence explains everything there is to know about love. And it's not even a love story!The cast is amazing! They couldn't have picked better actors for this movie. Logan Lerman was amazing but I already knew that before I started watching the movie. Hermione with American accent! Well Emma did great and it was a pleasure watching her again. I mean, she already proved herself with Harry Potter but with The Perks of Being Wallflower she proved that she can embody other people too. She was absolutely amazing and I think she has a successful career ahead of her. Being in love with Ezra Miller, I've seen practically every movie that he's made and this is by far one of his best. Make no mistake; he was brilliant in 'We need to talk about Kevin' and 'City Island' but he had competition there. In 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' he just stood out. Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev, Johnny Simmons and others were great just as well.I mustn't forget the soundtrack. It was brilliant but I guess it had to be so good since the music played a big role in this movie.I think the message was pretty clear. It was about accepting yourself, picking up the pieces and starting over. The message can also be that quote I mentioned before; 'We accept the love we think we deserve'. You can pick whichever message you want but I guess it depends on a mood you're currently in.So, yeah...I highly recommend this movie since it's now one of my favorite. I think you'll enjoy it the most if you watch it with your friends, but I guess that's up to you. Enjoy!",10,1,2,27 January 2013
Donnie Darko," 'Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?'
","Let me start by saying that this is by far my favorite movie. It's mind blowing! When I saw it the first time, I wasn't sure if I liked it or not. I wasn't even sure if I got the story right. So my point is that Donnie Darko is a movie you have to watch more than just once. OK, so the story is a masterpiece. I cannot even say what's so good about it but if someone asked me, my first guess would be that every person can interpret it in his on way. But it will always be right. Every character in the movie is used well and every word he says is important for the movie. The big scary rabbit called Frank who's Donnie's illusion is so freaking awesome. His voice, his costume and his monotony are perfect.Jake Gyllenhaal who embodies Donnie Darko is just amazing. His performance couldn't be better. We can sense his teenage-rebellious side and his schizophrenic-dark side. I think Gyllenhaal was perfect for the role. The way he talks and moves...everything fits. Mary Mcdonnell aka. his mother is just as perfect. We can see a typical mother who loves her son and is desperate to see him get better. I was really amazed by her performance when she realizes her son has an imaginary friend who is a big scary rabbit. Maggi Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore and Jena Malone were amazing just as well.The music is amazing and at moments even mind blowing. Every time Frank shows on the screen and that scary music plays, shivers go down my body.But all thanks go to Richard Kelly and the producers. oh and by the way, I was pretty stunned to hear that Drew Barrymore was one of the producers.So anyway, I made all my friends watch Donnie Darko and they all loved it. But i still think that Donnie Darko isn't a film everybody will like. People have different opinions and if you don't like this movie it doesn't mean that you're stupid.",10,0,2,8 January 2013
