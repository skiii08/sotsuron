Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Rich And Meaty
","Perhaps it was Quentin Tarentino's intention all along to present `Kill Bill' in two parts--how else can you explain the elaborate correction he performs on the first film's know-it-all attitude towards women? Where `Volume One' seemed to want to explain and ultimately dismiss women, `Volume Two' finds Tarentino in awe of them, especially his heroine `The Bride' (Uma Thurman), who, by the film's conclusion, has ascended to the throne that the director holds dearest: motherhood. It's an arduous path to that throne, going, as she does, from `natural-born killer' to loving parent but the respect that Tarentino gives the female mystique is as sincere and reverent as the respect he gives his cinematic and literary sources and it's part of what makes this film a masterpiece. The second volume is meatier than the first, with far more attention paid to the story and the richness of the relationship between `The Bride' and Bill (David Carradine, a perfect performance) which alternates between father-daughter, mentor-pupil and husband-wife. (Early scenes between them feature stunning close-ups bathed in warm sepia backlight and the chemistry is intuitive, palpable and instructive.). It's also somewhat less insistent on its revenge motif (though the battle between `The Bride' and Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver and its denouement is both films' high point). But the director turns up the psychological assault a notch and his ability to manipulate and terrify his audience is on a par with Hitchcock's. (Thurman's living burial is intense and agonizing.) As a filmmaker, Tarentino shows a remarkable mastery of his medium, employing, as he does, techniques that establish him as a scholar and not an imposter--the single-take reverse crane shot that frames the massacre in El Paso where the story has its' center is worthy of Ford and Peckinpah--and it confirms he's a true auteur who walks the walk: by culling from so many sources he's created a distinctive style that seems fresh and honest. He's also the only one who can execute it.",10,0,1,22 July 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Satisfying As Well As Disturbing
","Darren Aronofsky's brilliant adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel (unread) is definitely punishing but there's a wealth of innovation and analysis to reward the serious viewer. Aronofsky and his cinematographer and editor (Matthew Libatique and Jay Rabinowitz, respectively) employ a series of cinematic tricks (split-screen, different aspects of motion and lighting) but somehow they don't seem gimmicky at all--everything is employed to tell a complex story about the plight of addiction in the most efficient way possible. The film centers on a bright, likable Coney Island junkie, Harry (Jared Leto) and his widowed mother (Ellen Burstyn, in a role she isn't quite able to pull off until midway through but who devastates thereafter) who becomes hooked on speed believing she will be on television. Also figuring prominently are two other junkies, Harry's girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly in a very brave performance) and best friend (Marlon Wayans, also very fine). Each character delves deeper and deeper into a shared hell and it's to the writers' credit (both novelist and director wrote the screenplay) that none are able to escape into death's forgiveness. Yet Aronofsky and Selby are not interested in providing a moralistic after-school special; there's a clear identification with each character and you come to understand the motivations even if the choices seem woeful. Despite its relentless grimness, the film leaves you satisfied: there's a lot of pleasure in Aronofsky's technique and a very real sense of being impressed as well as shaken.",10,0,1,13 February 2002
Catch Me If You Can," Interesting But Not Fascinating
","Steven Spielberg's entertaining chase comedy/drama features a couple of very fine performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks as a forger who travels the world and the FBI agent determined to haul him in. Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr., it fits nicely into the Spielberg canon of films about splintered families; Abagnale's underlying motivations concern his determination to recover what the I.R.S. has taken from his tax-evading father and, in the process, repair his broken home. Though it's an interesting story, it's not an extremely fascinating one: once Spielberg and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson have set up the basic scams Abagnale operates, there's a lot of repetition over the first three-quarters of the film's 140 minutes (the action could have been pared a bit in the editing room) and it refreshes only in the final section, where Hanks overtly assumes the role of surrogate father to DiCaprio's needy child. After a couple of moody, personal science fiction films in 'Artificial Intelligence: AI' and 'Minority Report', Spielberg seems intent on losing himself in a wistfully retro action story--the film takes place in the Sixties but a Kennedy-era-innocent Sixties that seems cloistered from the events we've chosen to make iconic--but he's unable to let go of his dark side (he's probably incapable of ever making an `E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial' again) and the film wallows in its unhappiness. But he's energized by the engrossing lead performances that dominate everything around them: as people consumed by the actions of escaping and capturing, DiCaprio and Hanks lock into each other and the relationship they form subtlety invites the viewer into their game; Spielberg wisely allows the actors to interpret the material directly and keeps the pressure off the audience by making everything clear and digestible. With Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen and Christopher Walken, amusing and intelligent as Abagnale's father. The harsh sunlit cinematography is by Janusz Kaminski and the cleverly mod production design is by Jeannine Claudia Oppewall. John Williams' unassuming, jazzy score is surprisingly good, considering the source.",7,0,0,25 December 2002
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A Technical Marvel
","A technical marvel, animated virtuosity of the highest order, a film that still inspires awe even after all the digital advances that have followed it. Ostensibly directed by Robert Zemeckis, his presence is barely felt, overwhelmed by both the special effects and the overload of famous cartoon characters interacting with humans in this noir-ish fantasy of a forties Hollywood bordered by a ghetto populated with the animated characters of the period, used by the studios as a work force and treated as second-class citizens. Zemeckis' anonymity isn't much of a problem as the sheer ambition and comprehensiveness of the project makes it all giddily worthwhile; you can't stop loving the seamless mix of live and animated action. That said, the film is a bit too fast-paced and needlessly confusing and lead Bob Hoskins, as the private detective hired to investigate the murder of a human by `toon' Roger Rabbit, doesn't always acquit himself well, trying too hard to hide his British accent and embarrassingly made to act the buffoon towards the end. It's easy to see why the film can be considered a classic while Roger Rabbit himself remains far from legendary: as voiced by Charles Fleischer (who also voices several other characters as well), he's annoying, unfunny and instantly forgettable. Much more memorable are the characters of his sexy wife, Jessica (voiced by Kathleen Turner) and Christopher Lloyd as the villainous Judge Doom--they're delightfully tacky, carefully crafted and have a complexity that Roger fails to deliver. Many of the cartoon cameos are voiced by their original actors, including Mae Questel (as Betty Boop) and Mel Blanc (as most of the Warner Brothers representatives).",9,0,1,19 April 2003
Minority Report," Overlong And Dry
","Steven Spielberg's science fiction thriller (based on a short story by Philip K. Dick) is overlong and dry with plot holes too glaring to avoid and with twists so easy to anticipate that all the suspense bleeds out. Tom Cruise (competent in a role tailored to his limitations) plays a cop in a future Washington D.C. who heads a unit that, based on the visions of three seeming autistics, prevents murders before they can occur; when he's implicated in a future murder, the chase begins. The first section is full of didactic bluster as Cruise and a theologian-turned-Justice Department investigator (Colin Farrell, quite good, reminiscent of a young Treat Williams) hash out the moral and spiritual implications of a government preventing acts of free will--a political topic Hollywood superpowers such as Spielberg love to bellow mightily about--and for a while `Minority Report' seems like it's going to be good paranoid fun. But around the time Cruise is forced to go on the lam, Spielberg eschews the philosophizing in favor of run of the mill (if expertly done) chases and fights; when he finally returns to his theme at the end, it seems distant and an afterthought--too much time has elapsed for the earlier discussions to retain any power. With Max von Sydow as Cruise's boss, Samantha Morton as the most important clairvoyant and, in a very funny cameo as an illegally-practicing surgeon, Peter Stormare. The garish, backlit cinematography is by Spielberg's longtime collaborator, Janusz Kaminski.",5,1,3,29 January 2003
Training Day," Earnest And Misguided
","Denzel Washington plays against type effectively--he's evil--but in the end this is just another in Warner Brothers' long-standing tradition of earnest socially conscious dramas; the problem is that rather than addressing social ills, it just ends up patronizing its target audience, namely urban minority moviegoers, by delivering the notion, through a series of absurd coincidences, that street justice is more effective than law enforcement. Washington is relaxed and entertaining as a corrupt undercover cop who shows his new partner (Ethan Hawke, way out of his league) the ropes in south central L.A. but he plays into the conceits set up by screenwriter David Ayer (he wrote the slick `The Fast And The Furious') and in the end Washington's in cahoots with the film's stodgy finger-wagging, becoming little more than a stick figure. The director is the talented Antoine Fuqua (`The Replacement Killers') but this time he's reined in his talent for flashy color-driven visuals for the usual cloudy, bleached-out images we've come to expect when the subject is down-and-dirty L.A. Special note should be made of the cameo of singer/songwriter Macy Gray: she makes the most of her brief appearance, using unsteady hand movements and a fair amount of sass to create a vivid portrayal of a woman who knows she's being used by the police and who has no compunction about letting her feelings show--she has the best moment in the film and you end up wanting more.",5,1,12,28 April 2002
Monster," Stunning Performances
","Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci excel in their respective roles as serial killer Aileen Wuornos and her lover in director/writer Patty Jenkins' imagining of the circumstances that would drive Wuornos to commit the murders of seven Florida men (most of them thinking they were picking up a streetwalker). Jenkins' theories are all over the map and include pretty much the garden variety of possibilities (Wuornos' abuse as a child, her lack of education precluding her getting reasonable employment, her brutal rape at the hands of her first victim, etc.) but, fortunately, she's less interested in dwelling on her sociological positions than in letting her performers dissolve into their characters. Theron, in particular, is stunning: she seems to connect with Wuornos in a primal, subconscious manner and you get the feeling Theron is living the part, not merely acting it. Always an intriguing performer (she was quite good in `The Devil's Advocate'), here she refuses to hide behind her sun-scarred makeup and weight gain and succeeds in letting emerge Wuornos' entire personality rather than simply her barbaric need for revenge. Ricci is also excellent, as usual, smoothly underplaying a role that could have easily evolved into a histrionic attempt to capture the picture; like Theron, she seems attracted to the darker side of her nature but is able to use her complex powers of suggestion for definition rather than signal her conflicts. Together, the performances lift `Monster' above its overall routine disposition (though there is some nice late-afternoon cinematography by Steven Bernstein and the font used by Elton Garcia in the title, the same one used for Marlboro cigarettes, is a nice touch). With Bruce Dern as Wuornos' homeless ally and Pruitt Taylor Vince as the pathetic stuttering john intended by Jenkins to emblemize Wuornos' misguided compassion.",7,0,0,14 April 2004
The Rookie," Outstanding
","With `The Straight Story' and now `The Rookie', the Walt Disney Company is quietly putting together a series of quality films that transcend any expectations associated with the company while remaining wholesome, astute and committed. They're doing this by pairing talented filmmakers and actors with uncommon but inspiring true stories that have natural, universal conflicts built into them and the results are intelligent and moving. In this case, John Lee Hancock directs a beautifully convincing Dennis Quaid as Jim Morris, the Texas high school baseball coach who reached the major leagues in his late thirties. Hancock perfectly combines the simplicity of small town Texas life with the mythic purity of baseball and manages, almost innocently it would seem, to make every cliché seem fresh and believable; he has faith in the material (the well-thought screenplay is by Mike Rich) and in the audience's ability to see past the aspects of the plot that they've visited before. This applies all the way down to the typical strained father-son relationship sports films usually center on: using brief but incisive dialogue and the passage of time, Morris and his Navy father (Brian Cox) quietly spar with each other, struggling to achieve détente and the payoff is heartfelt and gratifying. The understated Quaid is a mixture of childish awe at his baseball prowess and grownup regret as he despairs over not following his dream--it's a performance that should probably ring true in most adults and it's his most affecting since `Breaking Away'. Hancock is greatly assisted by his cinematographer, John Schwartzman, who cuts through the Texas dust to provide a straightforward visual sharpness (in contrast to Freddie Francis' offbeat Midwest images in `The Straight Story'); and the inimitable Carter Burwell, whose hushed score is poignant and always appropriate. An outstanding movie, one that should have no difficulty standing the test of time.",10,0,0,8 September 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Hard Of Hearing
","Johnny Depp's withering pirate parody is probably the only reason to watch this swashbuckler update, but he's been better elsewhere and his performance is typical of the film's major problem, namely the slurred, mumbling accents that most of the cast has adopted. It makes for difficult viewing: the needlessly complicated plot is hampered by an inability to understand much of what is going on (although the basic outline is elemental to anyone who's ever seen a film of the genre); you have to strain to hear explanations for the more mystical aspects of the story. It's a very generic piece of work; the director, Gore Verbinski, doesn't seem to have the ability to create any real tension or action sequences that arouse much excitement and consistently allows the set pieces to be interrupted by long stretches of exposition (thanks to a wordy script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio that could have used a few decent jokes). Verbinski chooses to keep the focus on Depp and while Depp is always welcome whenever he's onscreen, he has trouble connecting with the rest of the cast, which, though it includes the incredibly hammy Geoffrey Rush, has nowhere near the acting bravura he has. The remainder of the cast includes Orlando Bloom (who fails to impress after `The Lord Of The Rings'), Jonathan Pryce and Keira Knightley.",5,1,2,11 February 2004
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy, Stupid, Love.
","A huge cast (Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Kevin Bacon, Marisa Tomei) struggles mightily with a glib, pre-fab screenplay by Dan Fogelman, packed with awkward situations that go nowhere. Each character seems to be prepared to espouse platitudes with the utmost sincerity any time the script deems them appropriate, even if credibility suffers, which it almost always does. With the exceptions of the agreeably smooth Gosling and the warm and witty Stone, everyone has done better work: they seem lost in all the talk; Carell, in particular, alters between cowering and manic but always just happens to be articulate enough to hammer home the literal points Fogelman is intent on making. Overlong and unengaging.",5,0,1,5 January 2014
Spider-Man 2," Visually And Emotionally Satisfying
","A long-awaited return to form for Sam Raimi, his best film since `Darkman'. This sequel to his hyperkinetic, indifferently made entry into the comic book adaptation genre is far more pleasing than the first, perhaps because the first's success has relieved Raimi of the stress of delivering a hit; he seems more relaxed, more focused on bringing craft (though the special effects still seem a little spotty) and depth to the project. He delivers an adult feature this time around, with scenes a bit more sadistic (one set piece in an operating room is particularly intense--and effective because it momentarily abandons Danny Elfman's very fine score) and a grown-up perspective on the goopy romance of the first film. The organic conceit of the drama isn't new, carrying the basic psychological construct of an awkward adolescent's search for a place in the world into young adulthood as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) finds difficulty reconciling his outsider status with everyday responsibilities; but in fact, by the end of the film, the main character is revealed to be Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) who has gone from the confused uncertainty of her relationship with Parker to a complete understanding of her role in it. (The actors, given more to do, are appealing here, though Dunst and Maguire are still too slight to solidly impress.) There's some genuine humor in Alvin Sargent's dependable script (this time there's a gentle ribbing of arrogant New Yorkers as opposed to the last film's post-9/11 reverence of them) and Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is an effectively conflicted villain; but Raimi's real connection is with one of the story writers, Michael Chabon, whose novel `The Amazing Adventures Of Kavalier And Clay' affectionately recreates the golden age of comic books and whose unique insights are in harmony with Raimi's love of that era's art and horror film genre (this film and `Darkman' are passionate homages to Universal Pictures' creature features), while Bill Pope's photography of the Manhattan skyline evokes a yearning for the innocent era Chabon's book so exquisitely captured. Visually and emotionally satisfying, it's good to see such traditional movie-making as Raimi's in this day and age.",9,0,0,5 July 2004
Finding Nemo," Pixar And Brooks Make A Great Team
","Pixar assumes the responsibility of gently leading children on the path to adulthood from Disney (itself busy trying to attract adolescents with more mature animated and live-action films) and delivers a beautiful, exciting animated feature about a neurotic clownfish who must rescue his kidnapped son, trapped in an aquarium in a Sydney dentist's office. Albert Brooks is the voice of the phobic father and it's a perfect fit, so much so it seems to have been designed around his persona--he's quite clearly part of the creative process and makes it as personal for him as it does for Andrew Stanton, the director (who also developed the story). It's in perfect harmony with Brooks' body of work as a filmmaker, showcasing his desire for familial overprotection that was at the heart of his `Mother' (but with none of the smug self-righteousness that marred it). His Marlin is joined on his journey by a hilarious Ellen DeGeneres as a short-term memory-challenged bluefish named Dory and she brings the simple verbal vaudeville of Gracie Allen in endearing herself to the audience. We've become quite accustomed to Pixar's dazzling visuals and this film is no exception, with its exquisite painter's palette of sea colors (particularly the shimmering, watery shades of teal and the sharp pastels that comprise the landscape) but the story is the design's equal, a balanced, clear-eyed view of father-son relationships and the recognition of personal growth by one another--it's moving and meaningful at the same time.",10,0,1,28 June 2003
Insomnia," Good, But Let's Get Going Here
","Christopher Nolan's follow-up to `Memento' proves he's the real deal when it comes to directing--he's got an eye for arresting images and works well with his editor--but he's going to have to wean himself off the gimmicky techniques that have distinguished him thus far. Here, the surprise provided is minor (it's cribbed from `Memento') and essentially visualizes what has been repeatedly verbalized throughout; it renders the effect as clever but showy. The theme is truth--not defining it but simply telling it, and with such a one-dimensional topic the film becomes overly moralistic, an embarrassingly simplistic adult bedtime story. Al Pacino plays an L.A. detective lent to a small-town Alaskan police force to solve the murder of a teenage girl; he brings a lot of baggage with him, mainly his partner (Martin Donovan) who intends to cut a deal on an internal affairs investigation that would probably implicate Pacino. When he accidentally kills Donovan in a stakeout, the only witness is the girl's killer (Robin Williams) who wants to cut a deal of his own. The second half, the pas-de-deux between Pacino and Williams, is where everything bogs down; like `Memento' you keep waiting for it to get to the end to see if you've matched wits. Unfortunately, you've outwitted it: it ends in the most predictable way possible. Williams brings a nice understatement to his role but Al Pacino is, as usual, Al Pacino: speaking with an accent that hints of the South, you get the impression Pacino's spent a lot of time developing a backstory to his character--too bad it doesn't seem that interesting a backstory. It would be nice to see Nolan try his hand at something outside the suspense genre lest he allow himself to get trapped into making the same film over and over again.",9,0,0,23 October 2002
The Hateful Eight," Good But Problematic
","Quentin Tarantino's last two features were revisionist histories of the antebellum South and World War II and 'The Hateful Eight' is nothing if not a revisionist approach to the film western as studio Hollywood has presented it and the way it has been consumed by the movie-going public. Tarantino pulls out all the stops here, at least in its initial engagement, lovingly presenting it in eye-popping anamorphic 70 mm that highlights his careful staging and Robert Richardson's equally detailed cinematography, with the first quarter of the film taking place in a Wyoming blizzard and the remainder in an overstuffed cabin. (The production design is by Yohei Taneda and the set decoration is by Rosemary Brandenburg.) The large-scale presentation finds Tarantino creating a post-Civil War scenario in which the players are Tarantino's forte: dirty, cold-blooded sadists (the film is hyper-violent to say the least) that an old school presentation this large would never have considered. And the first half features some of Tarantino's most expressive writing: having gotten his revenge on Nazis and slave owners, he can turn his attention to detailing strong characters and while racism remains an important theme in Tarantino's work, the film is ultimately about his love of storytelling; and his cast commits to him with absolutely no false notes. But it's here where he slips up, with a second half that seems filled with arbitrary characters and flashbacks to create story continuity (and where the topic of racism provides a slip in that continuity); and while the story's not exactly a mystery, the way the narrative is delineated seems somewhat unsatisfactory, with viewers unable to fill in the gaps by themselves--by leaving Tarantino to explain it all to us, he renders much of 'The Hateful Eight' somewhat pointless.",8,3,23,27 December 2015
Snatch," Diverting
","In spite of appropriating both the essence and part of the story of `The Watch' section of `Pulp Fiction', this is a pleasant, though violent, diversion, fast-paced and filled with a large ensemble of memorable characters with lots of juicy lines to say. The writer/director, Guy Ritchie, doesn't seem interested in much more than showing what he's learned from watching Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese and providing a rip-roaring good time; the actors seem to be having fun as well. It's a crime comedy about a large diamond that gets passed around the underworld boxing scene in London and although the dialogue is mostly delivered with thick Cockney accents, the injection of a sizable Hollywood contingent (including Benicio Del Toro, Dennis Farina and, as a gypsy with unintelligible diction, Brad Pitt) as well as the directorial influence gives the film a decidedly American feel. No great shakes but not a bad way to spend a couple of hours either.",7,0,1,31 August 2002
The Polar Express," Timeless
","Robert Zemeckis' self-indulgent, narcissistic masterpiece is entirely computer-animated and the enormous expense is all right up there on the screen, every penny of it. It's consistently in your face and (at least when seen on an IMAX screen in 3-D) frequently overwhelming--it's presented in a relentlessly showoffy manner. But it's also completely heartfelt and as moving as Zemeckis' best work, the sublime 'Cast Away' (itself one of the finest American films of the decade). The specialized CGI bravura is clearly the thing here, with well-thought, exciting and cleanly realized set pieces that take the nascent technical form to the limit. (A short section involving a floating train ticket is one of the most brilliantly realized examples of animation-any animation-ever created.) Based on the cherished children's book by Chris Van Allsburg in which a young boy who has ceased to believe in the magic of Santa Claus is whisked away on the titular train to the North Pole to restore his faith, it will delight and dazzle children of all ages and religious persuasions. But Zemeckis has become one of cinema's most sincere seekers and he concludes the film with a bittersweet questioning of the faith he has asked his audience to accept, noting that time--his primary passion in 'Cast Away'--and adulthood require the magic of innocent conviction to fade and be recalled simply as one of the components necessary to shape a life. Tom Hanks plays five roles that have been animated and they're some of the best he's played in quite a while, particularly the loving, no-nonsense Conductor that allows him to layer a humorously transparent veil of gruffness over the honest compassion he has styled his career upon. The magnificent Deco grandeur and elegance of the Polar Express itself and the North Pole workshops, by Rick Carter and Doug Chiang, fits effortlessly into Zemeckis' design of remembrance of things past. 'The Polar Express' should have no trouble being accepted as a holiday classic but time will reveal it to be what it truly is: the efforts of a master craftsman not only at the forefront of scientific methods to create art but with a yearning to explore the timeless qualities of being human.",10,1,4,11 November 2004
Taxi Driver," Primeval
","Martin Scorsese's fever dream about an reclusive Vietnam vet who drives the streets of New York in order to fuel his obsessive desire of ridding both the city and himself of demons has its startling moments (especially the graphically violent climax) and bravura performances from Robert DeNiro, Jodie Foster and Harvey Keitel; but it is also too loose in spots and some of the supporting actors are either blank (Cybill Shepherd) or wasted (Albert Brooks). Nevertheless, Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader have zeroed in precisely on the urban angst that infects many and causes some to evolve their moral and religious beliefs into perceived righteous vengeance; the filmmakers create a climate of fear both seductively palpable and dangerous. Even though some of the politics might seem dated, the primeval impulses will always be relevant and these impulses follow Scorsese onward, from `The King Of Comedy' to `After Hours' all the way through to `Bringing Out The Dead'. A very bold--if flawed--piece of cinematic art. The clever, jarring jazz score is the last by the great Bernard Herrmann.",9,0,0,10 March 2002
Lost in Translation," A Bright Mix Of Story And Film
","Sofia Coppola's efficient yet quirky romance is a very good engagement of two mediums, the short story and cinema. Using the technique of linking her converging story (two abandoned souls meet and form a gentle relationship while adrift in a foreign country) with short yet open-ended scenes, Coppola stays on course and doesn't descend into the dull trap of exposition--she succeeds in capturing the essence of a budding relationship, not the deep, complex flavor of it. Her script finds a popular American action film star (Bill Murray) in Tokyo to do some advertisements for a whiskey company; he meets the stranded young American wife (Scarlett Johansson) of a photographer (Giovanni Ribisi) and together they stumble into a relationship borne partly of their isolation and partly out of growing frustrations with their respective marriages. For all the usual observations and forced absurditities about foreign countries (naturally, the Japanese are seen as odd and other-worldly, pale imitations of Americans), Coppola's script is smart: she has insights that belie her youth and she circles the awkward relationship, allowing it to sneak up on you; by the end, even though it's still awkward, it's become accessible and you can easily infer what she doesn't want to tell you. Coppola gets an excellent performance from Johansson and a superior one from Murray; she seems to have captured him at a vulnerable point in his life--he's so in tune with his character's alienation that it appears to reflect his current point of view and not merely a function of the role. It also helps that he's frequently hilarious: his deadpan confusion gives the film a cinematic boost that makes Coppola's film seem less weighted down by its prose. It's a gently lulling picture, with unhurried rhythms; you never suffer the demand to feel that so many modern romantic films constantly thrust upon you and though there's an ambiguous, huddled ending, Coppola openly invites you to share your interpretation with her.",9,2,7,8 July 2004
Interstellar," Of A Piece
","As was apparent from his previous film, 'The Dark Knight Rises', Christopher Nolan has become the preeminent hack in Hollywood--and that's meant as a compliment. Nolan is a committed romantic: the only difference between him and, say, William Wyler, is that Nolan dresses up his love stories with astonishing visual effects and complex plots with a heavy emphasis on spiritualism. 'Interstellar' is Nolan's most accomplished work yet, with a far more satisfying mise en scene than his previous non-Batman work, the tedious and frustrating 'Inception', and he finds a more effective means to discuss what is fast becoming his major theme: time's effect on relationships, from the largest (all humanity) to the smallest (families) and his aw-shucks notion of transcendent love is sweet and satisfying. Though there are no real standouts, Nolan gets good performances from Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain and, in supporting roles, Casey Affleck and Nolan stalwart Michael Caine; they're good but where Nolan is going for tearjerking tenderness, the actors don't quite deliver. Still, Nolan's script (written along with his brother, Jonathan) is beautifully written and thought-provoking and the mammoth but necessary effects (an homage to Kubrick, sharply filmed by Hoyte Van Hoytema) are as outsized as Nolan needs them to be. Everything feels of a piece here and, as in 'Inception', you have to pay close attention. But this time it all flows together exquisitely.",10,2,3,14 November 2015
American Sniper," A Deeply Personal Piece Of Bravura Film Making
","Clint Eastwood's powerful meditation on war fits squarely with the themes that have informed his body of work, primarily the belief that with the absence of God, it is up to the individual to do God's work. There's a lot going on in Eastwood's and screenwriter Jason Hall's examination of Chris Kyle, considered the most 'successful' military sniper in American history (and portrayed by Bradley Cooper in a performance that elevates him from above-average to outstanding): he's a patriot but also an employee, a man who has found his career and is simply doing his job. There is some very graphic imagery to reinforce war's hellish nature but there's also an awful lot of banality: Kyle and his colleagues spend time during lulls in their missions discussing the mundane things that people typically talk about during work breaks. Eastwood and Hall are clearly admirers of their subject (the film's final images prove that point) and they do give him the benefit of the doubt (the film's sole flaw is that it acknowledges Kyle's PTSD while stateside yet by the conclusion he's inexplicably cured), but they're realists when it comes to the job he's hired to do and make no bones about his lack of concern about the morality of his mission. (As one character astutely points out, he carries a Bible with him but never opens it.) The film is galvanizing in its combat scenes; they move with an immediacy and adrenaline that surprises you, considering Eastwood's age. But he never blinks. Tom Stern provides the excellent cinematography, filming with a brightness that sharpens the action. (The film's final battle, though, takes place during a sandstorm, blanching and obscuring everything--it's harrowing.) Like all great Eastwood films, 'American Sniper' stays with you after it's over, encouraging you to meditate about everything it's trying to tell you (it's about a lot more than has been discussed here) and inviting you to argue back at it. It's a conversation well worth having.",10,43,80,7 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Grim
","Though it's a worthy addition to the `Star Wars' series (there's lots of eye candy), the aura of gee-whiz and kid-like vigor that has come to be expected has been replaced with a grimness of purpose that drains most of the fun out of the experience; what's left is creator George Lucas' relentless intention of ramming a narrative down your throat. Almost completely devoid of humor, Lucas seems to have put his blinkers on: in between chase and battle sequences are long, dull stretches of exposition meant to `explain' Anakin Skywalker's descent into Darth Vader (as played by Hayden Christensen, he's both a teenage rebel and a budding fascist) as well as his blossoming romance with politician Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). For the most part, the action sequences, while elaborate and convincing, are overlong; the final section, the actual clone attack, has so much going on and to such lengthy extremes that you begin to get distracted and confused (although Yoda, as the field general, keeps telling you what's supposed to be going on). The acting itself, usually reliable if not spectacular, this time around seems to have a joylessness to it (Ewen McGregor appears to have phoned in his Obi-Wan Kenobi) that makes things seem drearier than they should, although Christensen does have a nice, startling moment when he describes the rage he felt avenging an important death. In the end, though, the visuals make the enterprise worth it, particularly a short, monochromatic fight scene in a driving rainstorm on top of a mushroom-shaped building--it's vastly different from anything in the entire color-drenched series and wonderfully memorable.",6,0,0,30 June 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Pixar's Expanding Vision
","Every bit the equal of the `Toy Story' films but with larger vision, Pixar continues to explore the universal endearments of childhood; rather than have toys come to life, this time it's about the monsters that come out of the closet at night. Pixar's focus is not about scaring children but about the act of scaring children: it's a job to the main characters, portrayed as working-class stiffs trying to meet their quotas at an energy supply corporation that uses the kids' screams to produce power. It's a brilliant concept, naturally, but Pixar takes it further by creating a fully realized metropolis that exists as a sort of cross between the New York of the forties and the big city in any Marvel Comic, inhabited with pleasingly shaped creatures that complement the ambience and sleek lines of the settings. As in the `Toy Story' series there's as much for grownups as for children and repeated viewings seem almost mandatory (an inviting prospect); but this time around, there's a healthy skepticism towards corporations that's clearly adult. Another winner from Pixar/Disney.",10,0,1,1 February 2002
The Godfather: Part II," Special
","A masterpiece in its own right, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo's deepened history of a family's attempted assimilation into an America that increasingly resists them is told by creators that clearly love their people equally as much as they loathe them. Coppola and Puzo juggle two stories, the growth of the Corleone family under the direction of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) as he grimly tries to take the business legitimate, and the early life of his orphaned father (played here Robert De Niro in a bemused but attentive manner, with dialogue almost entirely in Italian) as he struggles to find his place in the New World. The filmmakers (and this is a collaboration between director and co-scenarist, make no mistake) with the success of the first film have the freedom to relax and tell a thorough story and it unfolds over more than three hours with pinpoint precision and convincing detail. The history it encompasses includes a fascinating foray into Cuba on the eve of revolution and it seems fresh, significant--a subject hitherto unexplored on the big screen; it makes the film seem special, independent of its older sibling. The performances are, again, wonderful and include a startlingly bitter Diane Keaton, a nuanced, graceful Lee Strasberg and a heartbreaking John Cazale. While no film can quite stand alongside its predecessor, this one comes as close as one can come and no film can quite stand alongside this one either.",10,1,2,1 April 2002
Rush," Daniel Bruhl Is About All There Is
","Daniel Bruhl's intelligent performance as Austrian race car driver Niki Lauda is about all there is to recommend in director Ron Howard's film about the rivalry between Lauda and English driver James Hunt (a preening Chris Hemsworth). Bruhl's focused, steel-eyed stare and effortlessly executed diction is filled with a sly sense of irony and sets apart what could have been a routine impersonation of a cold, clipped Germanic workhorse. After all these years, Howard still can't figure out how to deliver action without having to explain it to you and, as such, relies heavily on screenwriter Peter Morgan's heavy-handed exposition to tell you what you need to know. Morgan accomplishes this by having sportscasters yell into microphones about how the action taking place is so exciting; the result is condescending. Other than Bruhl, there isn't much else to recommend, with a couple of Howard's collaborators worth noting, cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and composer Hans Zimmer, turning in lesser work than they are capable of. Being a racing movie, it's edited within an inch of its life by longtime Howard colleagues Dan Hanley and Mike Hill; but their work is at least clean enough that you can reasonably follow along. Which is all Howard requires from you.",5,3,6,8 February 2015
The Aviator," A Disinterested Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese's biography of Howard Hughes' most productive years is distressingly impersonal and while any Scorsese is better than no Scorsese, 'The Aviator' has the feel of a debt being repaid to Miramax for making 'Gangs Of New York'. His commitment seems so low-level that what used to be a deliciously rigorous style here seems reduced to a series of trick shots that have less to do with burnishing an impression than with going through the motions of creating something merely impressive. The only time Scorsese appears engaged is in the first third in which Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) directs the aviation picture 'Hell's Angels' and then tussles with censors with a frenzy reminiscent of the director himself. The rest of the film evolves into a 'movie' movie with real characters portrayed by actors who act as if they're in a movie (particularly Oscar-baiting Cate Blanchett, as Katherine Hepburn, who appears to have watched 'The Philadelphia Story' one too many times). It takes DiCaprio almost two-thirds of the picture to discover Hughes but he finally does as he ages into a deeply troubled hermit who still can muster the courage to vanquish the foes, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (a very good Alan Alda) and Pan Am head Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), who have conspired to break him. In Hughes' later years, DiCaprio bears a definite resemblance to him, but it's also at this point that he bears a striking resemblance to the young Orson Welles, which further connects to the film's thematic links—-and, it would appear, Scorsese's way of passing the time for most of the film—-to 'Citizen Kane': John Logan's workman, easy-solution script (he blames Hughes' mother) attempts to portray him as a rich kid whose upbringing has traumatized him into an obsessive who lives to control the lives around him; and I swear Howard Shore's score seems at times to purloin Bernard Herrmann's. All that seems to be missing is Rosebud. Entertaining and over-sized but not particularly memorable—-you get the sense it started receding from Scorsese's memory after the premiere.",5,6,12,9 January 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," The Best Because It's The Simplest
","Probably the best of the trilogy for the simple reason that it's the easiest to follow: the Wachowski Brothers finally dispense with the philosophical claptrap that marred the first two pictures and rush-deliver a dumbed-down conclusion (love conquers all, believe it or not) in order to focus on two epic battles: one between humans and machines (a battle for the underground human city of Zion) and one between a human and computer program (Keanu Reeves' Neo and Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith). Or something like that. The two battles comprise essentially that last two-thirds of the movie, which means that it's perfectly all right to sit back and not have to think, and the relief, you realize, allows you to enjoy it as a movie-movie. The special effects, while far from innovative (there seems to be a lot of cribbing from James Cameron's `Aliens' and `Terminator 2: Judgment Day'), are diverting enough and the monumental martial arts fight between Reeves and Weaving is so long that you start to feel kind of giddy midway. These are emotions not often realized in the first two films; though there was plenty of awe at the effects, design and, initially, the concept, there never has been much joy in watching them. Here, while you realize that, overall, you're not watching anything particularly joyous, at least you're reasonably entertained. (Note: like its predecessor, this film was viewed in the IMAX format, which is proving to make a difference in fantasy and animation presentations; the clarity and depth of color is helping make this the preferred choice for these genres. Hopefully, the success of the format will convince studios that there is a market for oversized presentations of technically sophisticated films.)",6,0,0,3 December 2003
Lilo & Stitch," A Mixed Outcome
","One of the weirder Disney concepts: a genetically-mutated alien bent on destruction escapes to Earth, where he's adopted (as a dog) by a pair of orphaned sisters struggling to keep their family together. The younger sister, Lilo, is a friendless misfit, given to acting out rages stemming from parental abandonment and the bond she forms with her antisocial pet, Stitch, is natural, helping bind the family into a self-sufficient unit. (Her sister Nani's boyfriend David ultimately completes the set.) Perhaps the film's most interesting selling point is the elongated time it takes for the audience to develop affection for the characters; upfront, both Lilo and Stitch are maliciously irascible and the sentimental notions of family don't always seem to fit. (And the idea of Stitch's having no past--and thus no concept of family--due to his genetic engineering seems forced and oddly foreign.) But there are so many good absurdist comedy bits in writer/directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders' script that it's a relief when it loses its focus; when it doesn't have to be so ploddingly serious, it's very entertaining indeed. The setting is Hawaii, which means there are plenty of sunny color schemes in the animation; unfortunately, it's some of Disney's least interesting animation in years. The original songs by Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu are just as boring. But the tribute to Elvis Presley that serves as both a running joke and running commentary is a delightful stroke of genius and proves that Disney still has the chops to be the hippest animation team in the business.",7,2,3,14 December 2002
Bridge of Spies," Nuanced
","Especially with his adult entries, Steven Spielberg has made a claim for being perhaps America's most elegant filmmaker, with shrewd choices in material coupled with effective storytelling skills highlighted by precise framing and expert use of tracking cameras (in collaboration with his superb cinematographer Janusz Kaminski). 'Bridge Of Spies', while not quite reaching the Hitchcockian suspense and psychological depth of 'Munich', nonetheless is a very fine example of Spielberg working with commitment and intensity to provide the mature film-goer a satisfying, thoughtful experience. Here, the Cold-War plot (based on true events) is fairly cut-and-dried: a Russian spy (Mark Rylance), unsuccessfully defended by attorney Tom Hanks, is used as a negotiating tool to retrieve downed spy pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) and, against the wishes of the CIA spook (Scott Shepherd) fronting the mission in Berlin, a student trapped on the other side of the Wall (Will Rogers). Working from a beautifully written script by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers (supressing their smarm for a change), Spielberg underplays the action, working off body and facial nuance and well-timed, eloquent dialogue. The performers act with grace, particularly Hanks, continuing his transformation into the elder statesman of Hollywood film, and Rylance, whose placidity in the face of abandonment and death is appealing and entertaining. The only thing marring the film is Thomas Newton's score: while understated, it appears at inappropriate moments, distracting from the action on screen. But this is a minor quibble. The overall result is plausible and accessible--a very admirable addition to the impressive yet under-appreciated Spielberg canon.",9,1,3,31 January 2016
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now Redux
","Francis Ford Coppola has taken a very good film and turned it into a great one. Adding nearly one hour of footage, Coppola turns up the insanity level, focusing not as much on the political commentary as on the surrealism of both Vietnam and his project. There's a greater emphasis on women this time around and Coppola's approach is surprisingly sympathetic: the USO Playmates have been driven mad by their surroundings (their pathetic sexual encounters take place at a forlorn, muddy outpost in a driving rainstorm) and Aurore Clement appears to the main character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), as an angel of mercy (in perhaps the most astonishing section, a lengthy visit to a hidden French plantation). The scenes concerning Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) have been fleshed out somewhat but remain ambiguous and calmly ruminative, welcome and almost another movie in itself. Still, it's in the journey that Willard undertakes where most of the value can be found and Coppola's identification with the vivid dreamscapes make this a harrowing personal vision that lingers long after the film is over.",10,0,0,19 February 2002
Spider-Man," Been There...
","Though he's probably the best choice around, there's an air of desperation in Sam Raimi's direction, as if he needed a hit to reestablish himself on the A-list after duds like `A Simple Plan' and `The Gift', and he reaches into his old bag of tricks, trying to invoke the spirit of his sublime `Darkman'. He fails: the film has a lot of the `Darkman' look--especially the climax, which primarily takes place at night on top of a New York borough bridge--but little of the passion because, unlike the reverence with which Raimi regards the Universal horror films of the thirties and infused into `Darkman', he treats the Marvel Comic source material with an air of condescension, as if it were mere kitsch. And he doesn't stop there, borrowing indiscriminately from the obvious pop icons, the DC Comic-inspired `Superman' and `Batman' films--he doesn't seem to have the slightest desire to bring anything original to the project. The film is awash in computer effects and perhaps it's Raimi's intention to stylize the movement of the action but it seems a bit of a cover-up; there are so many unconvincing moments that you have to spend too much time telling yourself it's done that way on purpose. The script is another lazy hack job by David Koepp (`Panic Room', `Mission: Impossible') who not only hews it close to the Hollywood-101 bone by bringing in all the bullied teenager and father/son pathos he can, but also by stroking the citizenry of New York, elevating them, in the film's most shameless twist, to hero status. Perhaps the real culprit is Sony Pictures: the whole thing reeks of trying to keep the dying comic book film genre alive by aligning it with post-9/11 bloodlust. With Tobey Maguire, competent in the title role, Kirsten Dunst (so-so) as his would-be love interest and Willem Dafoe, pretty good as The Green Goblin.",4,0,0,8 November 2002
Collateral," Star Power
","This year's submission in the Tom Cruise Oscar grab is a stylized noir thriller from director Michael Mann, whose previous entries in the genre ('Heat', 'Thief') were bloated and derivative. Things aren't much better now: Mann's still derivative, though this time less of the subtle noir of the Forties than of modern gangster epics such as Brian DePalma's 'Scarface' with their razzle-dazzle nightclub shootouts. He might think he's making a small, intimate picture built on performances, but by encouraging underacting, he's actually oversizing the effect, with Cruise's megawatt star power unable to keep a lid on things; the movie gets louder and less interesting as it progresses. Cruise plays a hired assassin who employs a reticent cabbie (Jamie Foxx) to squire him to five various hits around Los Angeles. In writer Stuart Beattie's hands, there isn't much tension--you can see the structure of his screenplay from the first scene and the action set pieces seem baked in solely for Beattie and Mann to advance the dull interplay between Foxx and Cruise which spirals into conversations that inevitably boil down to the dreaded 'existential' despair that made 'Thief' and 'Heat' so unbearable. The film's meant to showcase the city's dark side but doesn't (Ken Russell's 'Whore' and Quentin Tarentino's 'Pulp Fiction' do a better job of that) because of Mann's fussy concentration on fitting Cruise into his visual scheme: he sports a short salt-and-pepper haircut and wears a gray suit, in line with Mann's sleek, blue-steeled, fluorescent building interiors (though certain scenes incorporate the neon that was emblematic of Mann's TV series 'Miami Vice'). Cruise is competent as usual, doing everything he can to keep his Vincent enigmatic, yet he only sporadically compels the audience's curiosity about his backstory. Foxx, as the driver, is better, though he's saddled with Beattie's caricature: his docile dreamer Max gets to be an outraged black man when he's able to seize the opportunity, which has the unfortunate effect of making what was supposed to be a brooding noir seem more like a self-actualization course.",4,0,0,22 August 2004
The Lego Movie," Awesome
","Sweet, sincere and hysterically funny, 'The Lego Movie' has an inspired crew working at a whirlwind pace to create dazzling visuals and very witty gags that both honor and gently lampoon the world of Lego. The result is a propulsive gem, a near-masterpiece that immediately envelops you and is able to maintain a consistency all the way through to its unexpectedly moving live-action conclusion. There's no sense in going through the plot, which is just a set-up for a series of chases through hallucinatory settings, but the film's flaw is contained there in its unnecessary send-ups of big business and religion; the movie needs them, I suppose, to give the plot its purpose, but they're not very developed and if the writers (which include the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) were trying to make points, they're not quite there. Far more successful is the relationship between adults and children from which the story germinates. But all that is secondary: with such entertaining material and such virtuosity in animation, it's hard not to absolutely fall in love. And of course, there's the song 'Everything Is Awesome' which will tattoo itself onto your brain the first time you hear it.",9,0,2,15 January 2015
The Fast and the Furious," Stylish
","Nothing wrong here. Rob Cohen's hyperdriven paean to illegal street racing is one of the more stylish films in recent memory and he gets some pretty good little performances from his actors, especially star-in-ascent Vin Diesel. Cohen is working as his title suggests but he also adds a bold use of color, flashy but not ostentatious editing and a sophisticated hip-hop soundtrack as a perfect compliment. As plots go, it's standard fifties fare, cribbing elements of `Rebel Without A Cause', but with everyone involved trying to create a technically superior experience, who cares?",8,1,1,20 March 2002
Ocean's Eleven," A Testosterone-Heavy Good Time
","A very obvious plot flaw towards the end concerning the lone female cast member almost sinks this lighthearted remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film concerning a simultaneous heist of three Vegas casinos. The fact that the flaw could have easily been corrected makes it all the more disconcerting and you leave the movie shaking your head. But ultimately the memory of the geniality of the project wins you over. It's definitely minor Steven Soderbergh but that's the point: after the seriousness of both `Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich' this must have been a welcome relief and he has a lot fun letting his actors indulge their hipness quotient. The large cast does just that, with George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts among others preferring to underplay rather than ham it up (although the always-welcome Carl Reiner has some very juicy scenes impersonating a Russian). Soderbergh revels in the testosterone heaviness of his film--there are some shots of backlit Vegas fountains exploding that would seem almost silly if they weren't tinged with the bit of melancholy that occurs after orgasm. All in all, a good way for Soderbergh to recharge his batteries.",8,0,0,1 March 2002
Spirited Away," Amazing
","Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpiece is a very foreign film--and not simply because it comes from another country (Japan); there's an imagination at work that's so organic and remote that it seems to spring from an individual's subconscious and as such feels as if it has no immediate relation to a single culture. But it connects universally, speaking as it does in a language that suggests anything's possible and children of all cultures will respond to it instinctively. (And it will touch the inner child of adults.) There's a stunning clarity in Miyazaki's hand-drawn animation and it's clear that a painstaking effort is made to detail every frame. His use of color is striking and gratifying: rather than depend on the bright, flashy pastels that seem to be the choice of computer animators, he uses a rich but muted palate that emphasizes the dreamlike aspects of the story (a young girl must rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs by angry spirits and in turn discovers her capabilities for self-reliance; in this regard, it's not unlike most Disney films) and finds its pleasures in the darker aspects of the settings and the characters. The story takes its time to develop and though some may find it more arduous than entertaining (and, admittedly, its mildly humorous moments are few and far between), as it builds the rewards become more and more evident until, by its simply beautiful conclusion, it's overwhelmed you and left you dazed. Unique, infused with wisdom and love.",10,1,2,2 August 2003
Die Hard 2," Where's John McTiernan When You Need Him?
","The reins for the sequel to `Die Hard' are passed from John McTiernan to Renny Harlin and although Harlin is McTiernan's equal technically, he fails to bring McTiernan's subtlety to a project badly in need of it. Part of the problem, it should be noted, is with the script (written by Steven E. deSouza--who also co-wrote the original--and Doug Richardson) which ignores the element of chance that the first was predicated on; here, Detective John McClane uses his super-sleuth skills to uncover a plot to commandeer Washington's Dulles Airport by a soldier of fortune (William Sadler, no Alan Rickman, sorry to say) and the thing just kind of lumbers off from there. Harlin, though, concentrates far too heavily on gory situations and shocking premises (the destruction of a jetliner filled with passengers, for example) to make the ride enjoyable and though there is great satisfaction in the climax, there's simply too much to detest and not nearly enough audience involvement.",3,12,23,20 March 2002
The Pianist," An Underrated Genius
","Perhaps because he generally works in a direct, naturalistic style and in a variety of genres, Roman Polanski could quite possibly be the most underrated filmmaker working today--which makes a film like `The Pianist' all the more startling. It's unexpected filmmaking, a complex yet measured account of Jewish life in wartime Warsaw, both in the ghetto and outside of it, filmed, as always, in Polanski's clean, simple style with beautiful camerawork (by Pawel Edelman) and evocative lighting. Though it may appear cold and methodical, Polanski's passion is subversively striking. Based on pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoir (unread) and adapted in an admirably economical fashion by Ronald Harwood, his story probably serves as a counterpoint to Polanski's own: the end titles reveal Szpilman remained in Poland until his death in 2000 whereas Polanski has essentially exiled himself from his native land and there's a sense of wistfulness in his recreation of the time; Warsaw is displayed as a peaceful urban center disrupted only by the advent of Nazism and, with one notable exception, the Poles are depicted as concerned citizens given to either helping or at least ignoring the Jews. Although it's as brutal to watch as `Schindler's List' (there are some short images that are truly troubling) the comparisons are not quite apt: whereas `Schindler's List' concerned itself with the Holocaust as a topic in and of itself, `The Pianist' seems intrigued not only with that subject but also with art's critical importance in a crisis society: not only is it a savior in troubled times but it's the bridge that bonds victim and barbarian; Polanski seems intent on providing a no-fuss definition of art that can have meaning to any audience. Adrien Brody plays the title role, subtly moving from cocksure artist to emaciated blank canvas for the director to project his fears and wonders. Absolutely outstanding, the work of a true cinematic genius.",10,0,1,23 February 2003
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Dazzling Visuals To The Rescue
","Another drolly twee film from Wes Anderson, better than some of his previous work ('The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou', 'Rushmore') but not nearly as good as others ('The Royal Tenenbaums', 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox'). Here, he assembles a mighty cast, with Ralph Fiennes starring as the fastidious and ambiguous manager of a distant eastern European hotel (located in the fictitious Republic of Zubrowka; the action takes place between world wars), whose care of his guests extends beyond the usual service and who gets involved with the nefarious family of one of his elderly lovers, led by son Adrian Brody (who, by wearing pseudo-Nazi clothing, unthinkably undermines his most famous role, the persecuted Jew of 'The Pianist'). This being Anderson, it's all about cadence: he expends an awful lot of energy synchronizing his actors' responses and the rhythms of the music (a winning score by Alexandre Desplat). But really, that's all it's about--the film is completely inconsequential nonsense. Sure, it's entertaining while you're watching it but you're completely aware that what you're watching has no real substance. All the performers competently perform to Anderson's stylized, obsessive/compulsive standards but the true stars of the film are Adam Stockhausen's gorgeous production design, Anna Pinnock's intricate set decoration and the fun art direction, led by Stephan O. Gessler: it's easy to get lost in the dazzling visuals, especially when there's no real need to pay attention to what's going on in the forefront. Conceivably, it may even be better with no sound--certainly, the overall design recalls the era of silent film.",7,4,6,25 January 2015
Seabiscuit," An Attempt At Instant Classic Status
","The first third of `Seabiscuit' is quite good--though writer/director Gary Ross' cops Ken Burns' documentarian style to illustrate the deadening despair of the Depression (he even appropriates historian/PBS host David McCullogh for narration)--with an earnest attempt at creating an interpersonal family drama between father-figure horse owner Jeff Bridges and tempestuous surrogate-son jockey Tobey Maguire. But then Seabiscuit appears and the film loses whatever momentum that's been generated. Starting out as a perceived underachiever, the horse's personality quickly evaporates as Ross insists on building it into some sort of crowning symbol of hope for the downtrodden. The director seems barely able to contain his glee in discovering an obscure American icon (at least until Laura Hillenbrand's biography, unread by this reviewer) he can exploit for his movie in order to create a myth he hopes will deliver it into classic status. But the resonance just isn't there for the modern audience. It's a modest entertainment with good performances by a gracefully aging Bridges, Maguire, Chris Cooper as Seabiscuit's trainer and an underused William H. Macy in comic relief as a goofy radio announcer, but tender though it is, its measured grasps for profundity come up short. The film does feature an outstanding sound design with excellent sound effects by Christopher Assells.",6,0,0,27 June 2004
28 Days Later...," Mostly Works
","Danny Boyle's post-modern update of George Romero's `Night of the Living Dead' is more chilling than scary, but it's still a pretty effective apocalyptic nightmare--even though it never quite becomes the nightmare you want it to be. The film is filled with disturbing images of a devastated Britain that stay with you long after it's over. (A long shot of the town of Manchester seen going up in flames is particularly haunting.) Boyle has shot the film in digital video (the camerawork is by Anthony Dod Mantle) and it's a good choice, bringing a grainy immediacy to the narrative and allowing Boyle to indulge in some flashy but useful shock editing whenever zombies infected by a `rage' virus are onscreen. But the director and his screenwriter, Alex Garland, aren't content to let the concept of a country (and, presumably, a world) destroyed by infection be what the film is ultimately about and the second half changes direction, introducing a plot of lesser value about a crazed army major (well-played by Christopher Eccleston) whose goals for the future of mankind are intended to be as outrageous as the more gruesome elements of the story but are not, unfortunately, nearly as interesting. Still, much like `Trainspotting', Boyle brings his indefatigable energy to the proceedings and the intensity never flags even when the ideas get shuffled around. The young, eager-to-please cast includes Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris and Megan Burns and they're up to a difficult task.",7,0,0,21 August 2003
Gone Girl," Long And Indifferent
","Scenarist Gillian Flynn and director David Fincher deliver an adaptation of Flynn's novel that takes an intense, slow burn story and somehow remakes it into a dull, suspense-sapping film that goes on far too long. Filming in the dark style that has become his trademark, Fincher treats his material with seeming indifference, apparently not finding enough compelling material to engage with and he settles for competent performances without nuance from leads Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Flynn's screenplay doesn't help: the twisting, devious plot as told by unreliable narrators that delighted and disturbed in her novel here gets a hurried treatment that seems to trivialize important episodes. Yet it's bloated where the novel was propulsive. Flynn's book was a cynical but identifiable take on marriage in America, marred by a fizzled, inert ending; yet here by the end she has turned her thesis into something larger and uglier, a violent war waged by calculating women against unwitting men.",5,1,4,3 July 2015
Drive," An Actor's Movie
","Ryan Gosling continues to develop as one of our better leading actors and while his performance here doesn't break any ground, his portrayal of a part-time stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver is the kind of stoic, intense role that audiences have come to identify as particularly American. The Danish director, Nicolas Winding Refn, seems to understand this and builds his L.A. noir around Gosling's combination of silent menace and vulnerability, which contributes to the delicious tension that forms almost immediately and which frequently explodes in well-filmed car chases and paralyzing ultra-violence (images, while well-edited by Newton Thomas Sigel, that are not for the faint of heart). Fine supporting performances by Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac and Ron Perlman also add to the quality flavor of the film; but it's Albert Brooks, playing against type as a brutal yet agreeable gangster, who continues to astonish, adding yet another layer of complexity to his diverse film repertoire and making him one of the greatest hidden assets Hollywood has to offer.",8,1,3,16 February 2014
The Theory of Everything," An Eloquent Screenplay
","Screenwriter Anthony McCarten figures out what he wants to say towards the end, and even if his conclusions are somewhat literal, it helps immeasurably to bring 'The Theory Of Everything' to its warm conclusion. McCarten's eloquent screenplay (based on Jane Hawking's book) and director James Marsh seem to want to match Stephen Hawking's theories about time's beginnings and, at the end, by running the films's main events in reverse, they cleverly compare the relationship between Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his first wife, Jane (Felicity Jones) to the big bang theory. McCarten's most interesting topic is perhaps the oddest when it comes to a biography of Stephen Hawking--sexual infidelity--and though he answers his questions about it childishly (he equates unfaithfulness with deathly illness in order to lay on the guilt), it's somewhat refreshing to find a film that eschews the traditional hagiographic view of romance when icons are involved. Redmayne and Jones are good enough, though you get the sense that there's no real degree of difficulty in their acting; in fact, as far as Redmayne is concerned, there's the distinct feel that acting is all he's doing.",7,0,0,22 February 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A Movie Movie
","This time, there's less J.R.R. Tolkien and more Peter Jackson--and that's a good thing. While still hewing close to the storyline in this second installment of the `Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, Jackson emphasizes character development over Tolkien's obsessions with myth and language and the results are far more evocative and immediate than the same events in the book. Jackson seems stubbornly determined to make a movie and not a mere representation of the novel, and as a result, there are liberties taken with the narrative (the book's fans will occasionally be disoriented but will adjust) that are used to open up not only the cinematic possibilities but to provide credible character motivations that Tolkien could not or would not provide. (Minor characters dismissed simplistically in the book such as Wormtongue, well-played by Brad Dourif, here help give emotion to the story and move the tale along in a convincing fashion.) The film, which follows three separate plot threads, is almost all cliffhangers and non-stop action (culminating in the enormous battle at Helm's Deep, which essentially comprises the final third of the film) and you're left with the delighted impression that Jackson's inspiration stems from serials and swashbucklers of the thirties as well as Cecil B. DeMille's `The Ten Commandments'. Overall, there's less balance than `The Fellowship Of The Ring'--this is out of Jackson's control as the ruggedness of the terrain dictates the plot--and it's relentlessly dark; but Andrew Lesnie's fluid camera once again captures the majesty of Jackson's larger-than-life vision and Grant Major's production design situates wooden-hut villages and stone fortresses in perfect harmony with the mountainsides that figure so prominently. Enormously satisfying, this is another superb complement--without being an imitation--to Tolkien's work and an outright cinematic triumph in its own right.",10,0,0,21 December 2002
School of Rock," Good
","Like Steven Soderbergh, Richard Linklater has proven capable of working within the studio system while remaining a presence in the avant garde and though `The School Of Rock' seems a bit too compromised (it is a Paramount picture, after all), it still serves as a contemporary family film featuring a fine, exciting performance by Jack Black. He stars as a heavy metal musician masquerading as a substitute teacher at a tony prep school who recruits his class of adolescents to form a rock band. Though it's ultimately satisfying, there seems to be quite a bit of movie left on the cutting room floor (most of the supporting characters played by such talented performers as Joan Cusack, Sarah Silverman and Mike White--who also wrote the screenplay--are reduced to caricatures) and the filmmakers play it safe by selecting heavy metal--easy parody material--as the music of choice. Though Linklater clearly likes this project, he doesn't invest a lot of emotion in it; it could have been much more significant than the knock-off it is. Black is often compared to John Belushi with his raucous, exaggerated mannerisms but he infuses his Neanderthal freneticism with a spontaneous articulation that highlights the versatility Belushi lacked and is vital to the picture's success. Together with `Shallow Hal', this proves Black can almost single-handedly carry a film and his future bodes well--a good thing for mass audiences.",7,3,4,23 November 2003
Hero," Dazzling
","Enormously entertaining, Zhang Yimou's dazzling epic manages to revel in all sorts of stylistic delirium while maintaining at all times a controlled sense of dignity. Part martial arts actioner, with enthralling, satisfying fight sequences, and part Chinese history lesson, Zhang paces his story (written by Zhang, Feng Li and Bin Wang) with a rushing torrent of sharp images sure to keep today's distracted audiences locked in (it makes sense that the film is 'presented' by Quentin Tarentino; it's precisely the type of movie he admires--subtle yet exciting--and could probably never make) while delicately unfolding the mystery surrounding the motives of a nameless loner (Jet Li) summoned by the King of the Qin province (Daoming Chen) to be rewarded for bringing down the King's three greatest threats. Aided by the peerless cinematographer Christopher Doyle, there isn't a wasted shot and the perfect symmetry of visuals and sound editing (a myriad of sound editors are employed) is as captivating as the story being told. Zhang has a great love for his country's history and its ritual--he seems proud to present the tale of the unification of China as well as the compassion and pragmatism of the people who forged that unification--and he trusts his content, rather than the emotions of his characters, to be his means of expression; yet when the performers do put themselves across, even the most minimal inflection (the slightest smile, for example) is devastating. With Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, the soul mates from Wong Kar-Wai's sublime 'In The Mood For Love', as two of the three threats to the King; again, they're perfect. 'Hero' is a film to surrender to--you're aware of the joyful look on your face even as you're hypnotized by it.",10,3,5,16 September 2004
No Man's Land," Powerfully Direct
","A clever black comedy, Denis Tanovic's film about enemies trapped in a trench during the conflict in Bosnia has a lot on its mind, primarily its intention to showcase the global political impotence towards the conflict and the insidious influence of a corrupt media--it covers a lot of bases. Tanovic doesn't have a lot of use for his characters other than as caricatures and mouthpieces (though there are some nice performances by Branko Djuric and Rene Bitorajac as two of the adversaries and Georges Siatidis as a concerned French U.N. observer) but he does infuse his script with plenty of humanity and the point of the project is to express his outrage at needless, sadistic carnage. Though the film is always predictable in its irony (especially the hardly-surprising ending) it never ceases to carry a wallop and Tanovic's blunt, angry agenda has a powerful directness that comes as a result of a persevering personal vision. Well-made.",9,0,1,30 April 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," A Disappointing Effort From A Fine Director
","Though it's set up as Harrison Ford's own `Thirteen Days' and though Kathryn Bigelow is one of our finest action directors, there isn't a whole lot of tension mounted in this true but predictable tale of a Soviet nuclear submarine in such distress it could trigger a war. Whereas `Thirteen Days' had an immediacy that transcended its historical premise, and irregardless of the fact that this film is told entirely from a Russian point of view, this is a good example of Hollywood stuck in cold war-Soviet bashing, with the communist state portrayed as narrow-minded, careless and under-equipped and if a nuclear war were to erupt, well, it would be their fault. There isn't much moral shading in Christopher Kyle's standardized screenplay and though Ford does play most of the film as a by-the-book captain devoted more to the state than his endangered crew, when push comes to shove he easily slips back into the stoic, colorless hero mode that he has indulged in since `Air Force One'. Bigelow's points of reference run less to `Thirteen Days' (itself a very fine model of taut historical action) than to `Titanic' (some of the initial shots of the submarine in dry-dock recall the initial shots of the Titanic at port and it even has its own happy proletariat dancing and drinking sequence) and `Apollo 13' (with its digitized tracking shots into the heart of a nuclear reactor and its makeshift problem-solving) but there's little of the personal involvement that made `Point Break', `Blue Steel' and the flawed `Strange Days' so compelling. Walter Murch is the film's editor but he's probably got quite a bit to do with the film's excellent sound design.",5,0,0,24 July 2002
Men in Black II," A Fast And Fun Time
","The special effects are surprisingly below expectations--there are some badly done matte shots and the animation supplements are fairly obvious--but fortunately the tongue-in-cheek camaraderie between leads Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, perhaps the most important component to the film's success, more than makes up for them and it's a sequel that because of its loose, funky nature outshines its predecessor (itself a good time). Breathlessly directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and written with pleasing goofiness by Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro, it goes about its business professionally and smoothly, essentially reprising the first film plot (aliens looking for a missing bauble while Earth is in jeopardy) but wisely expanding the roles of that film's best supporting characters (Frank the Pug--who earns the majority of laughs--and the lazy salamanders). The actors are clearly having fun--they know they've hit paydirt--and once again Smith proves to be a good sport by being the fall guy. A fast and fun time.",7,0,0,4 December 2002
The Imitation Game," Kind Of Insulting To The Hero...And The Viewer
","Benedict Cumberbatch is pretty good throughout but it seems he gets the best lines of Graham Moore's oh-so-witty screenplay early on; after that it's simply a run-of-the-mill Weinstein Brothers presentation, burnished with the usual prettiness that makes it nothing more than Oscar chum. (In fact, it's a perfect example on how the politics of Oscar campaigns trivialize the whole thing.) The film concerns itself with the tortured life of Alan Turing, whose machine eventually cracked the 'unbreakable' Nazi Enigma code. Moore writes him as a compilation of idiosyncrasies and throws everything together into a blur that appears to be Asperger's Syndrome mixed with childhood trauma and homosexuality--it all seems so easy to diagnose that very little of it ultimately rings true, and when Moore tries to develop Turing's emotional growth midway through, you know the jig is up as to what the film expects you to feel. It's kind of an insult to Turing to simplify him so easily and to the viewer for not being respected enough to deal with complexity. There's a fair amount of suspense generated (what will be the 'aha' moment that allows Turing and his group of math whizzes to crack the code?) but a dull Soviet spy subplot clutters the overall feel of the second half. With Keira Knightly, who specializes in period pieces in which she generates zero interest. The director is Morten Tyldum, also showing very little in the way of differentiation. Recommended only for Cumberbatch's performance, which keeps you engaged through his puppy-dog expressions; if the script gave him more opportunities to be as much fun as he is the beginning, the film would have been far more successful.",6,4,8,20 February 2015
8 Mile," Passion-Free
","A loosely fictionalized biography of Eminem is given the Hollywood treatment by noted director Curtis Hanson (`L.A. Confidential') with the rapper essentially playing himself. It's a very watchable movie, screenwriter Scott Silver's hip-hop variation on `Saturday Night Fever'; it's also not much of a stretch for all concerned (it's hard not to be convincing when you're essentially playing yourself) and not a whole lot of passion gets generated. Instead, much of the time is spent in self-admiration of its design and purpose, a tough-acting `exploration' of a `sub-culture'. Hanson insists on constantly using a handheld camera (the cinematographer is Rodrigo Prieto who also shot `Frida') but rather than provide immediacy, the typically glossy Universal Studio sheen makes this look only slightly different from an episode of `N.Y.P.D. Blue'. Eminem, far from the angry young man persona that's brought him notoriety, seems positively charitable, with the screenplay giving him a haloed aura, a poor, responsible (he loves his little sister), hardworking white waif desperate to make his way into a black culture that wants nothing more than to see him fail, trying to find love in the process (only to be misled by career-driven schemer Brittany Murphy, whose character is sorely underdeveloped); needless to say, as relaxed as he looks, he seems compromised. The supporting cast is filled with solid, professional actors who strip the film of the street credibility it's desperately trying to push across; particularly unconvincing is Kim Basinger, playing Eminem's white trash mom--cast in a purely sympathetic role, no matter how she tries (unfortunately, not very much), she radiates glamour. Other actors include Mekhi Phifer and Evan Jones (in the pathetic-follower role that Barry Miller got to play first in `Saturday Night Fever').",5,0,1,13 October 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A Welcome Return To Form
","Quentin Tarentino's insanely violent homage to exploitation cinema is, after the irrelevant, self-important `Jackie Brown', a welcome return to the filmmaking he does best (though he seems to be narrowing his audience to film school students and video store geeks). The first half features the shockingly graphic Americanized violence we've come to expect from him as he sets up a brutal fantasy about a woman (known as `The Bride' and played with relish by Uma Thurman) beaten and left for dead on her wedding day; after four years in a coma, she returns to exact her brutal revenge against her aggressors. In this first of two planned pictures, she battles two of the five (although, in typical Tarentino fashion, not chronologically). It's in the second half, where she travels to Japan to  commission a samurai sword from Hattori Hanzo (the legendary Sonny Chiba in a terrific performance) in order to confront O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), that the violence goes into overdrive, turning into a stylized chopsocky fever dream with each over-the-top situation outdoing the previous. (At one point, Thurman single-handedly takes on an army of nearly one hundred yakuza.) Though there's plenty of the sadistic misogyny that defines Tarentino as a cold-hearted egotist who seems immensely gratified seeing women tortured (you're reminded of his glee with his captive in `From Dusk Till Dawn'), there's also an overt desire to explain them--he gives each of the first part's major female characters the baggage that comes with being a woman. (Thurman grieves over the child she carried at the time of her attempted murder; Vivica A. Fox' young daughter interrupts their confrontation; and Liu's childhood character--in a chilling anime sequence--sees her parents slain and is a victim of pedophilia.) It's a bid for a pass that doesn't work: he can't help but dress up his observations with clever stylizations and he throws them into the mix as juicy tidbits merely to provoke discussion among his acolytes. Still, the film is great fun to watch, a nerd's passionate desire to regurgitate every exploitive action scene he's ever watched within the context of his art and surprisingly it comes off as sincere and reverent.",9,0,1,6 November 2003
Men in Black," Good Fun
","Superior special effects and a high irreverence make this a surprisingly easy way to spend a couple of hours. The concept is inspired: the world is populated by aliens disguised as ordinary folk and there's a secret branch of the INS designed to monitor them and protect us; and some of the gags in Ed Solomon's script (based on Lowell Cunningham's comic) border on genius (tabloids are telling the truth, the New York World's Fair statues are really spaceships). The film views aliens pretty much as we view foreigners, with a mixture of wary acceptance and trepidation but that high irreverence helps us get past the barebones intimations of xenophobia. And there's a real chemistry between the two perfectly cast principals, the smooth Tommy Lee Jones and entertaining Will Smith. Smith is especially endearing: he's at ease with the mild racial quips that go hand in hand with the film's themes and proves to be a good sport. Invisibly directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, whose lack of personality is a plus: he stays out of the way of the action and lets the story and visuals unfold cleanly.",8,0,0,16 July 2002
Elysium," A Wasted Effort
","A great idea--wealthy humans have abandoned a demolished Earth for a luxury space station, leaving behind the poor and disenfranchised while controlling them from afar--is ignored in this run-of-the-mill sci-fi action flick. It should have a lot of provocative things going for it, what with its socially conscious topic, but the bulk of the film is consumed with lead Matt Damon getting from point A to point B, facing obstacles all the while. By focusing on the surfeit of action, so little is made of its original conceit that it feels like a wasted effort. There are absolutely no surprises in writer/director Neill Blomkamp's Hollywood-101 storytelling (there's even a race to save a little girl dying of leukemia) and no depth to any of the characters. Damon is given little to do while Jodie Foster plays the villain--this might have been fun to watch, if only to see her overact and play against type, but, like everything else that might have mattered, Blomkamp could care less.",5,2,3,30 January 2014
Selma," Quietly Powerful
","Ava DuVernay's retelling of the events leading up to the march from Selma to Montgomery is an elegant, well-crafted film that, while breaking no new ground (and seeming to contradict well-researched data on Martin Luther King's relationship with Lyndon Johnson), is subtly moving. Like Dr. King, DuVernay prefers to work with words rather than depend on visuals and the result is a series of quiet, well-reasoned arguments (the articulate screenplay is by Paul Webb) that bring out the dignity of the topics and of the performers; when the necessary counterpoint of violence is shown, it only serves to underscore the importance of the discussions and DuVarny smartly keeps these sequences short. As a director, she makes good choices, preferring to film in the familiar sepia tones that we seem to associate with the civil rights movement (the cinematography is by Bradord Young); and she knows when to closely involve us (with the use of hand-held cameras) and when to wisely stay out of the way in order to let her performers shine--which they do, particularly David Oyelowo as King and Carmen Ejogo as his wife. They get so lost in the characters you can't help but be pulled in; one focus of the film is on the stress that the movement places on their marriage and the actors' convincing ability to unify on every level is one of the film's quiet triumphs. 'Selma' is a labor of love for DuVernay and while her facts may be questionable, as a filmmaker, she gets it right.",9,1,3,9 February 2015
From Hell," Very Effective
","At first, the Hughes Brothers might seem like an odd choice to direct this exceedingly graphic re-imagining of the Jack the Ripper case: two African Americans whose previous films (`Menace II Society' among them) dealt exclusively with current American social issues. But as the film goes on, you begin to be aware of a sympathy the filmmakers have for the Ripper's downtrodden victims that relates full well to their current concerns. Here, the victims are the desperate prostitutes struggling to survive in a ghetto where they are regularly persecuted and violently shaken down; and the Jews, whom the London police use as scapegoats for the murders in order to divert suspicion from a possible royal plot. The effect is subtle and very effective. There's also a great attention to period detail (everything about nineteenth-century London is presented convincingly--the production design is by Martin Childs who also did `Quills') and the added benefits of another excellent performance from Johnny Depp (perhaps today's most daring actor) and a fine one from Heather Graham. They're aided by a fine supporting cast including Ian Holm, Robbie Coltrane and Katrin Cartlidge (from Mike Leigh's ensemble). All in all, this is a distinguished film with its topics compelling and controversial. Be forewarned, though--this is a stomach-churning experience with many disturbing images and definitely not for the squeamish.",9,0,1,20 March 2002
Hoosiers," Good Performances Outweigh No-So-Good Everything Else
","Some of our finest performers (Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey, Dennis Hopper) are terrific here but David Anspaugh's high school basketball Cinderella story works more like a industrial motivational film promoting teamwork, which it does all the way up to its conclusion--and then it abandons the concept in favor of the individual heroics that's been chastised throughout. Anspaugh tries to cloak his rah-rah enthusiasm by setting his story in 1951 rural Indiana (it's based on a true story about the 1954 Milan Indians, the smallest Indiana school to ever win the state championship), projecting a more innocent time so that this type of story can be conferred the status of legend. But the contemporary (for 1986--it's very dated today) synthesized score by Jerry Goldsmith gives it away and Angelo Pizzo's misguided screenplay doesn't trust its own premise, leaving the viewer confused and a little skeptical. Still, there's plenty to admire in the committed performances by the leads: regardless of the spacy script, they insist on delivering top-notch work, even though the filmmakers don't deserve it.",6,3,8,27 November 2002
Pulp Fiction," Tarentino's Shot
","Quentin Tarentino's encyclopedic passion for noir films as well as seventies' television action shows is so powerful that you get giddy watching it and you have the sense that if no real ground is being broken, then at least `Pulp Fiction' is a culmination of a host of ideas. Linking together three stories (created by Tarentino and Roger Avery but with Tarentino getting the screenwriting credit) in a structure that can only be considered arcane for a film, he pulls out all the stops, cramming in as many references as he can to the pop culture that fascinates and repulses him. And working with his cinematographer, Andrzej Sekula, he creates an ugly, dirty Los Angeles underworld, the color baked out of it by a hot oppressive sun, in which his sordid characters (portrayed, among others, by John Travolta, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, each unforgettable) attempt to find value in their lives while wading through all the random violence and mistrust their world offers. If there are excesses--and there are, plenty of them--Tarentino can be forgiven them this time because you get the feeling that this is his best shot and he has to make the most of it. He succeeds brilliantly.",10,0,1,11 February 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Metaphysical Graffiti
","Though merely competent overall, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a better movie than the original, probably because this time out directors/conceptualists the Wachowski Brothers have no tolerance for the muss and fuss of explaining themselves to their audience--they just go about their business of crafting a universe in which they can stage all the martial arts fights and epic car chases they want and doll it up with prohibitively dense metaphysics that have meaning only to themselves and those that want to pretend they're in the know. There's apparently no need to bother with what appear to be major plot holes (such as whether Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, whose woodenness makes him weirdly perfect for the lead, is human or not--everyone keeps reminding him he is, even though he can fly) or characterization (the actors either under- or overact and some are caricaturized--most notably Lambert Wilson as the campy Frenchman Merovingian--to the point of embarrassment). But what the Wachowski Brothers do well, they do exceedingly well: those martial arts sequences (choreographed once again by the legendary Woo-ping Yuen) and the climactic fourteen minute freeway chase are thrilling in their carefully analyzed revisiting of shopworn action scenes; they don't know when to quit, but for some reason, it's impossible to not be fascinated. (Note: this film was viewed in the IMAX format and it's a wonderful choice for such an elaborate production. But the seemingly high-definition format also points to the struggle makeup artists will have to deal with in the future: every zit and facial imperfection is highlighted for the entire world to see and if I were Laurence Fishburne, I'd have that thing above my forehead checked out.)",6,0,0,5 July 2003
Mystic River," Brilliant Rage
","Perhaps Mel Gibson should be crying foul at all the negative attention he's gotten when he can easily point to Clint Eastwood's `Mystic River' as a film with perhaps a dimmer view of a religious culture, this one Catholicism. Expertly using a variety of sacred icons, Eastwood's harrowing tale (based on a Dennis Lehane novel, unread) of the interaction between three childhood friends who cross paths after the murder of one of their children finds its true culprit in the systematic repression and abuse of children and women by their faith. Perhaps unsettled by current events, Eastwood, through Tom Stern's careful cinematography, can barely conceal his rage: the gliding camera consistently pans upwards to the sky, seemingly searching for answers but coming to the conclusion that love in the Catholic Church has been perverted into cruelty and discrimination (presided over by an indifferent God). Usually Eastwood the director exerts direct control over his emotions but here it's impossible not to be aware of the moral revulsion of a man shaken of his convictions and his anguish as he reacts to the world around him. The performances are nothing short of astounding: as the grieving, vengeful father of a murdered daughter, Sean Penn is alternately moving and terrifying and delivers an emotionally thorough performance; Tim Robbins, as the abused child grown into a shattered adult--and the instant natural suspect--abandons his usual smugness and, by deliberately underplaying, galvanizes; and Kevin Bacon, the friend who has become the detective on the case, is intelligent and complicated as a man haunted by memories of a childhood altered by a single, horrifying act and how that act has affected his ability to connect with the wife who has left him; the women, played flawlessly by Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney, represent both extremes of where their faith has relegated them, with Harden rejected by it and Linney brainwashed by its male supremacy. The script by Brian Helgeland is a model of concision. A masterpiece--perhaps, when all is said and done, this decade's most potent commentary.",10,1,3,6 May 2004
Jersey Boys," Really Enjoyable
","A real treat. What makes Clint Eastwood such a great filmmaker is that even when he has no real personal involvement in a project he's still able to create a solid, beautifully crafted entertainment--he proves that when the time comes, he can let go of the serious themes that are so crucial to his oeuvre and simply enjoy the moment. Adapted from the jukebox musical by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elise (who wrote the musical's book), Eastwood, retaining the conceit of having the performers address the audience, opens up the play's sparse staging to capture an essence of Jersey in the Fifties (with an affectionate nod to Scorsese); he easily highlights the humor in the development of the Four Seasons from hoodlums with talent to a polished professional quartet and masterfully paces the film as it transitions to more melodramatic, yet equally compelling, conflicts. You can tell Eastwood really likes this material. Although some may find the characterizations cheesy, they're performed with eagerness and sincerity, with particular notice to be paid to Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito, whose id proves to be the group's undoing. As it was onstage, the songs are the thing (although, as Frankie Valli, John Lloyd Young's falsetto seems a little rough) and their significance in popular music cannot be overstated; indeed, a case could be made for writer/producer Bob Gaudio being one of the most important musicians of the twentieth century.",10,0,1,14 February 2015
12 Years a Slave," A Great Film Experience
","Steve McQueen's calculating, unerring eye shows you everything you need to see to form a judgment, but he wisely collaborates with both the great John Ridley ('U-Turn'), whose script gives '12 Years A Slave' a deep texture, and actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, who, working with committed filmmakers, allows his presence to become a blank canvas for McQueen and Ridley to convey their fear, anger, frustration and compassion. (Other examples of this in cinema are Catherine Deneuve and Luis Bunuel in 'Belle de Jour'; Adrien Brody and Roman Polanski in 'The Pianist'; and Brad Pitt and David Fincher in 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button'.) The result is a riveting, unrelenting and ultimately tragic story of slavery set against the backdrop of the lush (and indifferent) beauty of the Deep South. McQueen's focused tracking shots (the rich cinematography is by Sean Bobbitt) draw you into Ejiofor's point of view only to separate you at crucial moments so that you feel the crushing emotional weight of each character (in particular, during a brutal lashing that becomes the film's devastating climax). There are deeply felt supporting performances by a brave Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch (sympathetic in his conflict), the frequently overlooked Paul Dano, Lupita Nyong'o (whose despair permeates the film) and Michael Fassbender as the cruel plantation owner who comes to represent the South's many paradoxes; but note should also be made of Sarah Paulson as Fassbender's wife--it's her outrage at both her husband and her surroundings that lends the film the critical addition of sexual tension. A great film, one that demands future revisits.",10,3,5,20 February 2014
A Hard Day's Night," An Important Work
","Along with Michael Wadleigh's `Woodstock: Three Days Of Peace & Love' and Dennis Hopper's `Easy Rider', Richard Lester's `A Hard Day's Night' seem to personify the `right place at the right time' merging of film and music in the Sixties. `A Hard Day's Night' is probably the most important of these films, coming as it does with Beatlemania still swelling to uncharted heights and Lester capturing it in a verite style that lends an immediacy to what at the time could still be construed as merely a happy accident. Lester's innovation is assisted by Alun Owen's snappy screenplay (apart from some flights of fancy, it's remarkably realistic), the gracious charm of the Beatles themselves and John Jympson's tight, sophisticated editing. This film is the blueprint for the music video genre and is a spectacular piece of work that refuses to ever get tiresome.",10,3,4,14 October 2002
Whiplash," Problems Abound
","Better than it appears, thanks to an entertainingly over-the-top performance from J.K. Simmons, writer-director Damien Chazelle's feature is about a first year student (Miles Teller) studying jazz drumming at a prestigious music conservatory who's terrorized by Simmons' sadistic instructor. It sounds from afar like 'An Officer And A Gentleman' and, yes, personal breakthroughs are ultimately at stake, but it's precisely here where Chazelle trips up: the film's last third is filled with incredulous incidents that subvert the characters' motivations, especially at the conclusion, where a meeting of the minds effectively undercuts all that went before. And Chazelle's main character is a confusing mess: portrayed as a friendless, defensive loner, he still has no problem approaching the pretty girl (Melissa Benoist) working the concession stand at the local movie house and sparking her interest; he also has no problem dropping her shortly afterwords, rendering the subplot unnecessary. As a director, Chazelle is competent, but he seems to want to let the drumming relentlessly dictate Tom Cross' editing and it gets irritating after a while.",6,2,4,5 February 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Great Visuals From Someone Who Wants To Move On
","Though 'The Return Of The King' was a fitting conclusion to an immensely satisfying trilogy, it left you wanting more (what with 'The Hobbit' begging to be filmed). 'The Battle Of The Five Armies' is also a fitting conclusion, though 'The Hobbit' trilogy itself has not been nearly as memorable, and the director, the estimable Peter Jackson, seems more than ready to let go of his creation and move on to new challenges. Still, Jackson throws himself into the finale with a lot more energy than you would expect he could muster at this point and of the three 'Hobbit' films, this one is the best. Although the emphasis on battle seems like filler, it's more interesting filler than the filler the two previous films reeked of--the plot is almost given short shrift in favor of the magnificently filmed action scenes. The 'Hobbit' actors have overall left much less of an impression than the 'Lord Of The Rings' performers (indeed, the film's best scene involves holdovers Christopher Lee, Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellan as well as the image of Sauron) but here it makes it easier to give yourself up to the kinetic sensuality that the film is constantly pushing you towards; the battles fill you with more emotion than the narrative does. As good and as much fun as it is, though, it will eventually join the previous two films and fade in the collective memory--whereas its predecessors' place is assured.",9,3,7,25 December 2014
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The Blueprint
","Though it isn't the best of Walt Disney's creations (it would be surpassed on his very next feature `Pinocchio'--arguably the greatest film, animated or otherwise, ever made) and it has its share of continuity errors as well as character-development limitations, `Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs' still has such emotional power that it must rank as one of the greatest cinematic creations of all time. You identify with its art and mythology. It's the blueprint--both psychologically and creatively--for all that was to come in the animation field. Disney was taking a huge gamble in making the first full-length animated feature but his vision is so strong and encompassing that it reflects in every aspect of the film. In the end, half your tears are reserved for his triumph.",10,2,3,26 August 2002
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Entertaining, Accessible, Rigorous
","Dazzling and imaginative, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's tour de force soars because this time around, he's less of a moralizer and much more of a philosopher. Inarritu employs every visual trick in his repertoire (the film's signature is that it seems unedited) but enjoyably employs them in the service of a fable set in a Broadway theater. The result feels refreshingly immediate, urgent; in such a setting, the questions asked feel worthwhile. What's really interesting is that the questions themselves deal with a topic specific to a target (read: educated) audience. Inarritu and his collaborators (writers Nicolas Glacobone, Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo) concern themselves with art and all sorts of questions related to it: why is it made, who is it being made for, how does it relate to the the individual as well as the collective? Michael Keaton, wonderful in a performance imbued with a gravitas he seldom draws upon, plays an action-movie actor attempting redemption by directing, starring and adapting Raymond Carver for the stage; in order to realize his vision, he must run a harrowing gauntlet consisting of an antagonistic, preening actor (Edward Norton, loads of fun), a relationship with a co-star (Andrea Riseborough), a daughter fresh out of rehab (Emma Stone) and a critic hell-bent on destroying him (Lindsay Duncan). Inarritu works with a magical realism (Keaton is able to use telekinesis to manipulate his surroundings and is responsible for some of the stresses that befall him) but the film, taking place as it does in a familiar setting, seems grounded throughout even when the open-ended (yet fulfilling) conclusion is just as magical; rather than the clean resolutions that restored the world in 'Babel', here it's the individual, alone and detached from every surrounding antagonist, that makes a messy breakthrough and the result speaks to every member of the viewing audience. Entertaining and accessible but also rigorous, it's about time a film played to an engaged audience and not only to the multiplex masses. Kudos to Antonio Sanchez' brilliant drum score, which continuously yet subtly comments on the film's content.",10,6,14,18 February 2015
The Big Short," An Archetypal Black Comedy
","Adam McKay's adaptation of Michael Lewis' very readable recounting of the financial meltdown in 2007-8 hews closely enough to Lewis' book, but the spirit here is more manic and hysterical and the dour worldview that Lewis infuses in his work is amplified, focusing on the dire effects the meltdown had on the average citizen--there's a despair here that makes this an archetypal black comedy. McKay and his co-scenarist Charles Randolph change the names of some of Lewis' oddball personalities and some of their motivations, the most notable being Ryan Gosling's jaded, arrogant Jared Vennett, based on the book's bond salesman Greg Lippmann, a minor but important character, who here serves as the narrator best suited to the cynicism the film stews in. McKay serves up his story with all the cinematic tricks he can find, with lots of freeze frames, blackouts, whizzing cameras, newsreel footage (the frenetically entertaining editing by Hank Corwin helps tremendously), characters breaking down the fourth wall to address the audience and real-life celebrities brought in to explain some of the more complicated points of the sordid financial products being marketed. But he hits his comedic marks most of the time and when the film needs to emphasize the tragic nature of the crisis, the shift is effectively jarring. The powerhouse cast (in addition to Gosling, there's Christian Bale, Steve Carrell and Brad Pitt) is uniformly excellent--Pitt, as a reluctant colleague to two young bumbling novice investors, is often hilarious--but it's Carrell's troubled investor, here known as Mark Baum, who really shines: with a delicate commitment in his eyes, Baum sees beyond the immediacy of the debacle into the soul-sucking Wall Street machine and agonizes over its effect on modern society. Thanks to McKay's pointed anger you feel Carrell's realizations and sense of resignation on a more cerebral level uncommon in most modern performances and it helps the film achieve an unusual power. Recommended.",9,0,0,30 January 2016
Vanilla Sky," A Mess
","Cameron Crowe finally confirms what's been suspected for quite some time--that's he's a shallow filmmaker with limited range and visual sensibilities--in perhaps the worst film produced by a major studio this past decade. Crowe reunites with star Tom Cruise to deliver a meandering, incomprehensible fantasy (based on Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 film, `Open Your Eyes', unseen by this reviewer) about the price of beauty and it's easy to see the appeal this theme would have to an actor whose career has been defined by his classic good looks. But Cruise has neither the intellectual prowess nor the acting chops to incite any curiosity (indeed, he spends half the time mumbling through a prosthetic mask or grisly facial makeup) and Crowe seems to want to do little else but indulge his star in wild bits of overacting. As usual, Crowe's staid writing style makes everyone else (including Penelope Cruz, Kurt Russell and Cameron Diaz) look bad too: each performer has some bad dialogue to deliver at one point or another and is forced to do it in an embarrassingly earnest way. Crowe, after incomprehensibly trying--and failing--to position himself as Billy Wilder (you can't be Billy Wilder without mingling romance with cynicism and Crowe doesn't appear to have a cynical bone in his body), seems to be setting himself up as a mixture of Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, but he's far too pedestrian a filmmaker to capture the essence of either director and the result is a trite, talky, open-ended mess that ends up becoming little more than an ersatz science-fiction mess--albeit with a great soundtrack. You could spend hours trying to decide what it's `about'--and Crowe would love nothing more than to have you do just that--but it would be a waste of time because, other than the vanity thing, it's really about nothing at all. The harsh shock editing is by Joe Hutshing and Mark Livolsi and they destroy the decent, if uninspired, work turned in by cinematographer John Toll. No matter--nothing could overcome Crowe's dull cinematic style anyway.",2,1,2,18 August 2002
Bruce Almighty," Carrey Shines But The Film Doesn't
","This should probably be a fine vehicle for Jim Carrey--a hard-luck soft-news anchor is given the reins while God takes a vacation--and his enormous comedic skills are very much in evidence (which alone makes it worth recommending) but there seems to be a bit too much restraint and tidiness on display, a classic example of Universal Studio's sanitized version of America; ostensibly set in Buffalo, it could be Anywhere U.S.A. as long as it's the spotless, W.A.S.P. Anywhere U.S.A. the studio insists on force-feeding the world. (The fact that God is played by African-American Morgan Freeman seems meant to throw us off the track but doesn't--God may be black but He apparently has little interest in anyone other than His white followers.) Carrey throws himself into the project, capitalizing on the apparent desperation he's exhibiting while trying to recover from his disappointing serious work (`The Truman Show', `Man In The Moon') and his physical comedy has never been better; but while it's a pleasure to watch a master craftsman at work, the material he's given works only sporadically, most notably in extended scenes such as an on-air meltdown at Niagara Falls and his tormenting of the anchor who's passed him over for the top job. (The anchor is nicely played by Steven Carell, displaying the same crack timing as Carrey.) While Carrey makes the movie worthwhile, the overall pacing is slack, thanks to the lackluster direction by Tom Shadyac, who, as in films such as `The Nutty Professor', prefers to just point the camera and let his stars bring him the glory.",6,0,1,15 June 2003
Signs," Scary and Moving At The Same Time
","It's easy to see why `Signs' would be such a success with moviegoers: people are constantly looking to have their faith reaffirmed, especially in these times, and a film like this is able to provide that reaffirmation in a unique take on the horror genre. It's scary and moving at the same time. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan has created a far more surprising thriller than he did in his breakthrough `The Sixth Sense', this time constructing a puzzle that you don't realize is a puzzle until the climax. Ostensibly a film about an apparent alien invasion, Shyamalan concentrates his story on a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania, where a pastor (Mel Gibson, in a carefully constructed performance) who has left the church after the untimely death of his wife struggles to reconcile his anger and disbelief; in this regard it becomes a very personal film questioning not only the presence of God during tragedy but also a God who creates tragedy as part of plans both great and small. Shyamalan creates an unnerving atmosphere by deliberately withholding information about the invasion: most of the news reports are speculative and haphazardly disseminated, allowing the audience to identify and share a sense of dread that lingers long after it's over. Unlike `The Sixth Sense' there's a droll humor that sneaks up on you (a scene involving a teenager's spontaneous confession delightfully tricks you into laughing when you least expect to) and it gives the film a reassuring warmth that helps keep everything centered. Shyamalan seems to realize his limitations as a thinker--he doesn't pretend to be profound--but he does treat his audience with respect and invests his film with an intelligence and wit that's perfect for a studio feature. A very satisfying experience, not easily forgotten or dismissed.",10,2,6,1 September 2002
Saving Mr. Banks," File Under Guilty Pleasures
","It may seem a slight concept--Walt Disney and author P.L. Travers reluctantly collaborate on an adaptation of her 'Mary Poppins' series--but in the hands of director John Lee Hancock (the criminally under-appreciated 'The Rookie'), there's a grace and charm that makes for an enjoyably nostalgic experience, even if the tears generated from the script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith aren't always earned honestly. The film cross-cuts between the contentious effort to adapt Travers' work and her Australian childhood, where she struggles to save her parents' marriage and, in particular, her father's romantic idealism, which has been crushed by alcoholism. (Her father is played by a fine Colin Farrell.) This earnest effort to 'explain' (read: psychoanalyze) Travers' soured worldview seems labored and determined and it drags the film's rhythms down; but it helps that Hancock has Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks as the leads--both turn in the entertaining performances one would hope for, which is to say well-suited to their scenery-chomping proclivities. It's a very professional piece of filmmaking, easy to watch and suitable for filing under Guilty Pleasures.",7,0,2,6 October 2014
Amélie," Recommended And Forgotten At The Same Time!
","Though it's easily recommendable, Jean-Pierre Jeunet's trifle is just as easily forgettable. Try as he might, Jeunet isn't able to create anything remotely indelible in this sweet story of a wistful young woman (Audrey Tautou) who attempts to make the people who inhabit her world happier; when she comes across a book of strange portrait photography, she sets out to connect with the photographer (Mathieu Kassovitz). Jeunet pulls out all the animated and digital stops at his disposal and while it's never less than lovely to gaze at, it has the qualities of a comedy sketch television show (indeed, it has the feel of a low-key French Monty Python) and when the mysterious old man in the apartment below that appears in every French romance starts to become a major character, you know there isn't much point in paying close attention. Some might find this simple but densely-packed feature charming in its innocence (and goodness knows we need more films like this that have no use for violence) but others might be immune to its charms because of its one-dimensional presentation. It's a film for which it's quite possible to enjoy yet have absolutely no opinion.",6,0,1,7 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Extremely Satisfying
","In this final, extremely satisfying installment of `The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, Peter Jackson confirms himself as the Cecil B. DeMille of our time, a master purveyor of entertainment and showmanship with superior storytelling skills. Jackson throughout has set out to make his own movies and not become a slave to J.R.R. Tolkien's books (awful as they are--I couldn't make it through the last one) and this episode particularly benefits from his cinematic vision and the refitting by the writers (who, in addition to Jackson, include Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) of major plot points and the deepening of the character motivation so sorely lacking in Tolkien's prose; there's a lot of emotion on display and it's frequently overwhelming. Jackson gives the audience what it wants and gives himself the pleasure of having created a work of art that is deeply personal as well, embodying, as it does, notions of chivalry and honor that go all the way back to `Heavenly Creatures'. In order to bring the massive story to closure, Jackson is forced to concentrate more on plot and battle (the film's centerpiece, the oversized battle at Pelennor Fields, is enthralling, with plenty of swaggering action drawn from the Warner Bros. swashbucklers of the thirties) and have his cast shoulder the responsibility of maintaining interest in the characters--but fortunately everyone is up to the challenge, with Sean Astin (as Sam, for whom the story is ultimately about) and Elijah Wood (as Frodo, sensitively handling the supporting role to which he has been relegated) being the moral centers. Jackson and production designer Grant Major, for the finale, have combined the best design schemes of the previous two films, the warm, colorful textures of the `The Fellowship Of The Ring' with the rocky monochromatic landscapes of `The Two Towers' and the result is a breathtaking, moving cinematic experience that delivers the trilogy into movie legend; the fact that it's now over means that audiences will feel an acute loss at Christmastime from hereon in.",10,0,0,20 January 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Jared's Review
","This movie was a spectacular movie. Definitely, the hardest role to play had to either be Sam played by Sean Astin, or Frodo played by Elijah Wood. There is the most action in this movie than the other two. Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen, who is starting in a whole new movie called Hidalgo, is an awesome actor but isn't in the movie a whole lot. The special affects are amazing, especially the dead people and the King of the dead played by Paul Norell. Also, when Legolas (Orlando Bloom) shoots down an elephant, it happens so fast. Arwen (Liv Tyler) has to make a decision between a mortal life or an elven life. There are some funny comments by Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) in the movie. But an absolutely great job by Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf, he also makes many funny comments in the 3 hours 20 minutes of the movie. Merry played by Dominic Monaghan has a big surprise for the fans. Miranda Otto who plays Eowyn has a huge role in this movie. Billy Boyd taken to the safest place on middle-earth, Minis Tirith, makes a big mistake. I say that these three movies make up the best trilogy. But I'll leave you to do the work and see what happens if Arwen makes the big decision, or what happens with Merry and Pippin, or what Eowyn does. And lastly, will Frodo throw the one ring that rules them all into the fires of Mount Doom?",10,0,0,27 December 2003
Cloud Atlas," Ho-Hum Ideas Made Almost Interesting
","David Mitchell's bloated novel of thin ideas was told in a nesting doll manner, with five chronological stories interrupted while climbing to a complete sixth story and then stepping back to complete the remaining stories, ending at the first. The odd but appealing combination of writer-directors Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis prefer to tell the stories through cross-cutting--and turn in a more satisfying experience than the book ever was. It's a good, not great, film, primarily because Mitchell's concept--that we are connected, even by such tenuous connections as a birthmark, making us a sea of change--is hardly impressive enough to sustain a film running close to three hours; and there are also glaring plot holes in the script borne by the Wachowskis' insistence on stuffing in action sequences which didn't exist in Mitchell's narrative. But the stories are told with grace and the fact that the majority of the cast (which includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent and the Wachowskis' go-to for bad guys, Hugo Weaving) play multiple roles--many of them performed in drag--does more to advance MItchell's ho-hum concepts than he ever could.",7,0,2,28 September 2014
Gangs of New York," Technical Virtousity
","Dante Ferretti's overwhelmingly detailed production design (with set decoration by Francesca LoSchiavo and costume design by Sandy Powell) and Michael Ballhaus' masterful tracking camerawork helps push Martin Scorsese's passionate revisionist history of gang wars between Irish immigrants and Americans into greatness. It's one of the few times (his minor period piece `The Age Of Innocence' is another) where Scorsese has relied so heavily on sets and costuming to advance his New York themes (here it's about the city's amalgamation) and it's also one of his most commercial efforts to date: with its big names (Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz) and familiar plot (it's another story of revenge) to attract a mass audience, Scorsese tones down the graphic nature of the tale; while there's plenty of bloodshed, it's far less shocking than the knife-in-the-hand images of `Taxi Driver' and living burial in `Casino'. The story is by Jay Cocks, but the script seems pieced together with individual contributions from Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan and while it does at times meander from incident to incident, it never bores over the course of one hundred and sixty-eight minutes because the violent tension that keeps mounting is mixed with the characters' poverty-stricken despair and the effect, while it comes close, doesn't desensitize you. The performances by the principals are excellent (DiCaprio has an unreadable look in his eyes and makes a great mythic hero and Diaz does well in a role that's underwritten yet touching); and in fact the film's best moment is a quiet conversation in which Day-Lewis describes to DiCaprio his respect for his enemy/counterpart, the noble warrior (DiCaprio's late father, played in the opening section by Liam Neeson). Day-Lewis' penchant for overacting here serves him well; his misguided isolationist anger is balanced by his respect for the rules of combat and he seems to be as concerned with his character's philosophical motivations as much as the violent ones. Scorsese has never overly politicized but he does here and while his sympathies towards the newcomers is obvious and a bit cloying, the indignation he feels about how these peoples were used, relegated to the periphery and then discarded while laying the foundation of today's New York seems a reasonable, justified response. At this point in his career, Scorsese seems to believe he has to make an epic statement about his town and country to give value to his career--he needn't; his body of work speaks for itself--but while this may not be the crowning achievement he wants it to be, its' technical virtuosity makes it quite an impressive achievement in a class by itself.",10,1,1,26 January 2003
Windtalkers," A Sappy Screenplay
","A well-paced second half almost redeems John Woo's war picture, which suffers from a first half bogged down by awkward exposition and some amazingly corny dialogue throughout courtesy of screenwriters John Rice and Joe Batteer. Though he attempts to bring a heightened realism to the genre (a la `Saving Private Ryan' and `The Thin Red Line'), Woo seems stuck in a forties time warp when it comes to character development and interaction (everyone's here: the racially divided loners, the white bigot, the Greek, the Italian, etc.) and the material's surface skimming is frustrating. But there's an interesting performance from Nicolas Cage as a tormented World War II Marine assigned to protect (along with counterpart Christian Slater) the code needed to attack the Japanese on Sai-Pan; that the code is held by two Navajos is less important than the code talkers not being captured alive and forms the crux of Cage's dilemma as he begins to form an uneasy bond with one of them (Adam Beach). Cage, who has a tendency to overplay, remains fairly sullen and though he threatens at times to explode into parody thanks to the sappy screenplay, he manages to stay in character for the duration and any sympathy we feel towards him is well-earned. After the impersonal hack job Woo did on `Mission: Impossible II', he seems gratified to return to his usual theme of male bonding between opposites and while the setting should be a good one for him, the bad writing keeps the film from coming alive. Jeffrey L. Kimball's sharp cinematography is a plus.",5,3,5,23 November 2002
Her," Befuddled
","There's less than meets the eye in writer/director Spike Jonze's attempt to intertwine modern-day romance with technology, with Jonze fabricating a befuddled story about a writer (Joaquin Phoenix, barely registering) who falls in love with the disembodied voice of his new operating system (Scarlett Johansson). It's difficult to parse what Jonze is trying to say because it feels as if he's trying to invent a topic and dress it up within a science-fiction milieu--the film is set in a futuristic Los Angeles (in reality Shanghai) where everyone appears alienated and insular. (It's also a Los Angeles where the population seems weirdly homogenized, a blend of white, Asian and lighter-skinned blacks wearing nerdy, yet funky, clothes.) Although Shanghai offers some lovely urban skylines, aided by the dusky cinematography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, too much of the action takes place in the same closed-in settings (Phoenix' office and apartment, particularly his bedroom) so that it gets kind of maddening, especially as the conversations he has with Johanssen charting the relationship's cycle get longer; though never quite boring, your frustration level begins to rise as they constantly work through their feelings. Where Jonze really confounds, though, is in his characterization of Johannson's Samantha: he's designed his film around her growth but seems shocked and disappointed when he comes to understand that underneath her exotica, what he's really created is just a woman, and a confused, needy and untrustworthy one at that.",5,1,3,14 February 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Full-Tilt
","George Miller's nightmare post-apocalypse vision is told primarily through kinetic visuals with dialogue provided only when needed. Yet it's so simple a story he's telling that the visuals are pretty much all that are needed; Miller relies on the visceral to move his story along. This all works because the dystopian world Miller and co-scenarists Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris creates is complete, with history, customs and rituals fully developed and identifiable; the viewer doesn't need a whole lot to buy in. This is also true in relation to the main characters, Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and Max (Tom Hardy): they don't have a lot to say but you get them immediately. Miller consistently comes up with imaginative set pieces (there's a knockout sandstorm and a nice monochromatic section is an interesting alternative to the mostly daylight action--the production design is by Colin Gibson) and displays as much Gothic grotesquery as he possibly can: there are alabaster bald children, weird midgets and startlingly obese men on wild display and that guitar player swinging from the front of the truck gave me the creeps; he gets tremendous make-up artistry from a team led by Lesley Vanderwalt, Elka Wardega and Damian Martin; every ugly image--and there are many--is beautifully rendered. Everything is full-tilt here but fortunately John Seale's cinematography and Margaret Sixel's editing are up to the task. Miller has thrown away the campy shtick that was 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' in order to revisit and fortify the series' original raison d'etre: a despairing view of a world gone insane due to a dependency on oil. Its relevance is just as timely as it was back in the days of 'The Road Warrior' and even though it's a heady theme, this entry is just as entertaining as 'The Road Warrior' was, only turned up to eleven. The soundtrack is by Junkie XL (he of the remix of Elvis' 'A Little Less Conversation') and it's very good.",9,1,6,21 February 2016
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Supremacy
","At the end, Tony Gilroy's ham-fisted screenplay ponderously verbalizes what Matt Damon's sensitive performance has already conveyed throughout--that for what it's worth, 'The Bourne Supremacy' is about guilt and atonement. Until that point, though, it's director Paul Greengrass' thrill ride, pure and simple, and it really is a rush, with a story told through hand-held cameras (the director of photography is Oliver Wood) and editing (by Richard Pearson and Christopher Rouse), both effective enough to deflect the violence that concludes many of the set pieces. Damon is perfectly cast as the amnesiac Bourne, who struggles to find his reality while methodically resetting the world around him with laser focus. It may be little more than an entertainment (someone tell Gilroy) but it's a quick 108 minutes.",7,0,1,6 January 2014
The Martian," The Geeks Shall Inherit Mars
","Dull and far too long, Ridley Scott's space opera has virtually no suspense and little by way of emotional involvement; where tears of joy should be flowing, all you feel is cold and disinterested. Matt Damon (usually reliable; here, vapid and one-note) plays an astronaut/botanist who is left for dead on Mars by his crew (led by Jessica Chastain, equally monotonous--where is the adventurous actress from 'The Tree Of Life' and 'Zero Dark Thirty'?) and is forced to use his gee-whiz skills to survive while NASA figures out how to get him back. There seems little at stake in Scott's dramatic telling: every calamity that befalls the main character is simply another setback which seems to have no impact on him: you're given the notion that rationing is forcing him to thin out, yet Damon's physique never changes; and for all the talk in Drew Goddard's screenplay about the tremendous stress Damon is under, he shows very little sign of it. Goddard's script (based on Andy Weir's wildly popular novel, unread) is filled with lots of technical jargon and celebrates the geekiness of the characters (the absentminded genius geek here is played by a wasted Donald Glover) but they're not nearly interesting enough to sympathize with or even caricatures you can laugh at. And the film's basic conceit--long-term survival on another planet--seems too spurious to make an entire film from; you're left to assume the science of the endeavor has its basis in fact and that the jargon bandied about is enough above the average viewer's head (at least it is to this head) to seem realistic. But who knows? Sure, 'Insterstellar' had just as much conjecture as 'The Martian' but Christopher Nolan's sincerity and heart won you over. Here, Scott's technical bravura is on full display but he has little interest in being anything other than a technician--what should be a lush, romantic, crowd-pleasing adventure instead is rendered limp and hollow, an exercise gorgeous to look at and not much else.",5,0,4,6 February 2016
