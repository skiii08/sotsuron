The Blair Witch Project," 'Tell us where you are Josh!' - Excellent Movie
","Student videographers Heather, Josh and Mike enter the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland.  The premise of the movie is that, one year later, their footage (from a cam-corder and an 8mm camera) is found and aired.  But enough about the movie, which I enjoyed.  What really blew me away was the IDEA of The Blair Witch Project.  
The idea for this movie was fresh and interesting.  1st person video/film, with a simple cast and spontaneous dialogue.  They get into some trouble, and as their situation worsens, they cope with it as humans would.  Suspense is high, as is empathy for the characters.  The emotions they produce for the camera are as real as they need to be.
For movie-goers suffering under the yoke of such intellectual midgets/hollywood heavyweights as Jerry Bruckheimer/James Cameron, I think this just what was needed; a bunch of rookies who go out and spend about $20,000 and make one of the best movies of the year.
Warning:  for people who are big fans of the above-mentioned dough-heads, your attention span is probably way too short already.  Don't both with Blair Witch.  This is a movie for those who still wish to be challenged by the cinematic medium.  It's no insult to the film for me to say it was a difficult movie to watch.  But it was worth it.",Null,0,1,12 August 2003
28 Days Later...," Post-Apocalypic Bicycle Messenger...Awesome.
","I enjoyed 28 Days Later immensely.  Director Danny Boyle's vision of England, devastated by an horrific plague which turns its victims into raging maniacs is frightening and thought-provoking.  This movie is raw and difficult to watch, so fake sci-fi/horror enthusiasts and the faint-of-heart need not waste their time.  The violence is brutal and constant.Bicycle Courier Jim awakens after an accident-induced coma to find himself alone in the city of London.  He explores the empty metropolis and quickly learns of a catastrophe.  A virus has spread, there has been a mass evacuation, many people have died.  Those infected are caught in a state of permanent violent rage.  Jim, along with other survivors, must decide what is worth living for, and what is worth dying for, in the world post-apocalypse.This story of the apocalypse, like so many others, is really about what happens AFTER the apocalypse.  What kind of people are the survivors?  How do the survivors cope?  How do they interact?  What kind of society are they going to form in the aftermath?  Questions of morality and existence are raised which the viewer must answer.I recommend this movie to enthusiasts of such films as The Road Warrior, The Quiet Earth, The Postman.  28 Days Later is difficult to watch, at times, but poignant and inspiring and very, very relevant.",Null,0,0,30 June 2003
Signs," An edge of the seat movie about losing faith, and finding it.
","M. Night Shyamalan tackles the issue of faith through the filter of science-fiction.  Former Reverend Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), has thrown away his collar after the tragic accidental death of his wife.  In Hess's words, 'I will not waste one more minute on prayer!'  This to the consternation of his family, brother Merril (Joaquin Phoenix), son Morgan (Rory Culkin), and daughter Bo (Abagail Breslin).
After the appearance of crop circles in the corn fields of their Pennsylvania farm, the family must pull together to deal with the frightening reality that they will soon face.  Graham will not have the luxury of wallowing in his own bitterness for much longer.
This is an excellent movie for several reasons.  It takes the Alien sci-fi genre, and gives it an entirely new treatment, a very cerebral treatment. Also, true to Shyamalan's cinematic ideals, it gives us a deeper moral question for which the movie is merely a framer.  The question; are you the kind of person that believes that things just happen, or that they happen for a reason, is certainly worth asking.
Excellent acting here, especially from child actors Culkin and Breslin.  I found the movie well-paced and riveting throughout and would recommend it as a suspense thriller with a message to anyone looking for a few chills.",Null,0,1,11 August 2003
Am√©lie," Viva la conscience d'Amelie!
","Amelie (Audrey Tautou)is a paralyzingly introverted Paris sweetheart with a very different outlook on life.  In the wake of the tragedy surrounding the death of Princess Dianna, she goes about her life, asserting her own sense of morality.  Some people she helps, others she punishes.  But who will help Amelie get what she deserves???
Amelie caught my attention and held it for two hours.  Light-hearted, fast-paced and fun, this movie features visual effects (such as transparent pocket), that help the story move, as well as narration and some interesting views of Amelie's sub-conscious, viewed as through the Television.  This movie is funny and well done, and Tautou's presence and charm put it over the top.  An excellent film.",Null,0,2,19 August 2003
