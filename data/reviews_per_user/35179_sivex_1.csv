First Man," Wonderful-brilliant directing
","After swaggering 'LaLa Land' and 'Whiplash', I was really interested to see Damien approach of this subject.
Watching this wonderful movie was a real delight.
It was not so much about acting, which was normal, average, but real-authentic directing and filming.
Damien Chazelle succeed in leading the whole film flawlessly, brilliantly executing and controlling every single framework, leaving me with feeling of authenticity and real breathtaking scenes.",9,0,1,12 January 2019
