3:10 to Yuma," Spaghetti Western, this is not.
","This movie was such a disappointment. The story line was thin at best with no character development whatsoever. Russel Crowes performance is good however, but given the lack of dialog, I wonder if this movie would have suited a silent movie At over 120 minutes in length and such a slow storyline it could have been condensed to 90 minutes with the same outcome due to the slow pace. Spaghetti Western's such as Fist Full of Dollars etc kill this, especially given the budget of this film. Except for the music which suited the movie, I would not want to see this again. Wait for the DVD as its not worth the price of admission. Isn't Russel Crowesupposed to be in a band? From his performance in this film, he's got to be happy hes not a full-time singer!",5,0,0,25 October 2008
