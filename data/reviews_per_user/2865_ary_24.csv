The Blair Witch Project," Interesting movie
","I watched The Blair Witch a few days ago, because it took some time for the release here in Brazil.This is an interesting and innovative motion picture, with great actings (Heather Donahue is fantastic), great lines (there is one specially funny line in which one of the friends mention Deliverance) and some scary moments. Different from other horror movies, is what you don't see in The Blair Witch that almost turns you crazy, is the psychological aspect of the tension, of the loneliness that makes it so great!the ending is really frightening, and one of the most intense moments show the friends inside a hut at night, and then they start to hear children voice: it's the most powerful part!",Null,0,1,4 October 1999
Scarface," De Palma makes one of the most brutal, realistic and shocking movies about crime...
","A fugitive from Cuba becomes, in short time,the most powerful drugs' trafficker of Miami, and his ascension is as fast as decadence. The Oliver Stone's script doesn't open concessions: it conducts this violent story in a realistic and cruel way, and demonstrates the price that the criminals pay for the power. Replete of cynic and biting dialogues and moments loaded with pathological brutality (the scene in which Al Pacino's character has to kill an ambassador who will make declarations that may destroy his drug empire before he arrives on the tribunal is memorable), 'Scarface' still counts with the Brian de Palma's experienced direction, a film maker who had already demonstrated previously his talent in 'The Fury'.In this movie, De Palma has the chance to work out what he knows best: ally dramatic moments and excellent interpretations with technical camera movements and effects, all of them meticulously calculated to bring the movie's felling to the audience. The main cast's performance is excellent, with prominence for Steven Bauer interpreting the powerful criminal's best friend.In spite of long and strong, the film is an excellent entertainment.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Se7en," Director David Fincher studies the limits of the cruelty and the human's degradation, through an implacable hunt for a serial killer!!
","A pretty and vain woman is tied in a bed and she has her face rip up with a razor. An obese man is forced to eat till his stomach explodes. A corrupt and greedy lawyer has part of his belly pulled up and he is forced to eat it. These are just some of the rudest scenes of a violent and morbid film that was filmed in 1995 and attracted a lot of people around the whole world to the box offices, but it also created plenty of polemic. The film is already one of the best thrillers done and it follows the noir style, generating,this way,an almost unbearable sensation of mystery, tension and fear, but at the same time attractive. The story of the film is intriguing and touching: detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) is sent to a new policemen's division in a violent metropolis (one of the great ideas of the plot is exactly not to mention in any moment the name of the city nor the year in which the story happens, making the show here more mysterious and intriguing ) and he has to team up with detective Sommerset (Morgan Freeman). It is obvious, from the first encounter among them,that the two don't understand each other and they don't like each other,but when a brutal series of murders begin to happen, following the seven capital sins, they are found in a situation in that they can either get join to hunt the violent serial killer or they won't be able to do nothing to stop the brutal crimes that are scaring the whole press around the world. And starting from that interesting and well-armed story several memorable and unforgettable scenes will happen, as the persecution in a full street, the talking and the thrill feeling between Tracy (Gwyneth Palthrow), the woman of Mills, and Sommerset in a restaurant, and the final climax that without a doubt is consecrated as the most shocking scene of film's history, and surprisingly this scene doesn't show anything concrete, but it suggests, what still turns everything more unbearable. 'Seven' is an excellent film, a masterpiece directed with effectiveness by director David Fincher, who gets to ally a good plot and good sceneries (that explore the whole degrading aspect of the city: the homosexuals, the prostitutes, the drug addicts) with the exquisite Darius Khondji's picture, that certainly reaches the excellence level that, for example, Vilmos Szigmond got in 'Deliverance'. The only problem of 'Seven', that impedes it of consecrating itself as an absolute classic of the generÃ´ and to reign in the gallery in where the master Hitchcock's  films are, resides in the fact that the film 'gives away too soon' the identity of the murderer. If perhaps the identity was surprising  the film would have shocked more, and it would become better. Even so 'Seven' failed in that point, where it lacked more courage of the excellent film director David Fincher, but it achieved it's goal in many, many other points. But my analysis on the film only makes me to recommend it, and if you want yourself to be a part a  without- truces and breath-taking hunt,rent this film now!!!'Seven' is Rated R for grisly afterviews of horrific and bizarre killings, and for strong language; and it runs 123 minutes. The Cast: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, Gwyneth Palthrow and John C. McGinley.",Null,0,0,3 May 1999
X-Men," Terrific,old-fashioned and brilliant film!
","It took a lot of time for X-Men to make it to the big screen and turn into a motion picture event, but the final result was worth the waiting.This smash-hit not only beat the crap out of the other blockbusters but also received terrific reviews and gained the love of the public around the whole world for a very good reason: what makes X-Men such a vivid, interesting and original movie is the fact that it isn't a typical pointless action blockbuster.X-Men reminds me a lot of the first Superman, released in 1978, because such as X-Men, back in the seventies Superman was the motion picture that everybody was waiting to see for a long time, and people made lines in front of the theaters to watch for the first time a man flying.So, you see, it had that appeal, that feeling, and the movie also had a good, well-written story, you don't get wall-to-wall action in Superman - of course, there are adventure and scenes in which the special effects are necessary to build that moment - but the story is so sweet and human that you feel like you really got to know every one of the characters in the end. You cheered for Superman, you cried in some sad scenes, you enjoyed the ride. But nowadays, you don't get that feeling any more.X-Men came in just about the right time, with its old-fashioned story, in which the main characters, and not just the special effects, have the spotlight.In X-Men you will find everything that makes a movie so great- a terrific director (Brian Singer is the guy responsible for films like Apt Pupil and The Usual Suspects), a brilliant story and great acting by a talented cast, Anna Paquin is so beautiful and great here!she changed a lot since The Piano,the only thing that didn't change is her powerful talent!congratulations for the cast directors for giving to Hugh Jackman the role of Wolverine, this is the part he was born to play, and he is such one hell of a good actor that I am certain that he has a brilliant, stellar future on Hollywood!watch X-Men, and discover again the pleasure to watch a beautiful and old-fashioned story!",Null,0,0,20 September 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Extremely violent to the point of being unpleasant!
","Sleepy Hollow is one of the worst films of 1999, a big embarrassment for the Paramount Studios and everybody involved with this mess. Tim Burton directed this macabre and bizarre story with the generous doses of sadism that are actually a common thing of his whole career. Extremely violent to the point of being unpleasant, with over-the-top and exaggerated performances by the main cast and a story full of holes, Sleepy Hollow is such a disappointment that Johnny Depp should avoid to come closer to Burton for the next hundred years.The only thing that saved this bomb from the total failure was the presence of Casper Van Dien, who provided some few interesting moments and stole every frame he was in but ended up disappearing just as quickly.Even a horror film must have a script that gives to the story a clear and concise development, so the audience can understand what's going on and get involved with the movie, but Sleepy Hollow is more like a huge 'gluing' of scenes that have no connection at all. If you really want to watch a good horror flick, rent Hellbound Hellraiser 2 or Deadly Friend.",Null,0,0,19 October 2000
Alien," Terrifying
","It is difficult to believe that director Ridley Scott's frightening and terrifying film was made in the seventies. Alien still possesses an impressive vigor and strength, such as another classic that also seems so fresh and vivid, Deliverance, a powerful adventure about four common people who are hunted down by hillbillies in some river of Georgia. Alien places a crew of astronauts being threatened by an implacable alien that kills each one of them without mercy. The gigantic sceneries and the disturbing visual (the scene in which Kane - John Hurt - explores a cave has a terrific impact) were remarkable and brought innovation for movie making, because at the time, the vision that Hollywood had of space was bright and clean (Star Wars).This dark, tense visual helped to increase more fear and suspense to the story. Ridley Scott's direction is outstanding  - he develops his characters carefully, giving to every actor a chance to shine. Scott develops real 'characters', and not fearless heroes, in a way this makes the people inside the theaters to identify themselves with the protagonists. Scott created memorable scenes,it's impossible to forget John Hurt's horrible, cruel death : alongside with Ned Beatty's rape in Deliverance, this scene is one of the most gruesome things ever putted on the screen.One of the greatest films of all time, I highly recommend Alien's DVD, Twentieth Century Fox made an outstanding job with it, adding extras, trailers, commentary and more. And don't forget to check Deliverance if you haven't seen it yet.",Null,1,3,6 May 2000
Rocky II," Get ready to go the distance again with Rocky in this great film!
","When it first came out in 1976, Rocky conquered the sympathy and love of audiences all around the world with the story of this simple-minded innocent man who has his million-to-one shoot and strives to go the distance for self-respect.To this day Rocky remains one of the finest films ever. A sequence was inevitable, and Stallone comes back to the role that earned him an Oscar Nomination,in Rocky 2.This time also directing the movie, he demonstrates a surprisingly dexterity for the job, because he sustains during the whole time the moving and thrilling rhythm that made the first one so great. Rocky's running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum again, followed by thousands of children, Bill Conti's unforgettable 'Gonna Fly Now' and the dramatic and decisive final bout between Rocky and Apollo are the top moments of the movie.This is an inspiring drama about how important is to fight for our dreams and goals, and it also teaches that if even we don't achieve our greatest desires in the end, it's always worth fighting for them.My rating is: **** out of ***** (four stars out of five).",Null,0,0,21 September 2000
Aliens," William Hope shows his talent in this film
","James Cameron,the man who revolutionized the science fiction cinema with Terminator,directs the sequence for Ridley Scott's Alien,following the genre's primer,and converts the second one into a typical action show,stuffed with the best special-effects  money can buy.In the originality query,the film doesn't function,however,it achieves a better quality than the first one,when we compare both in entertainment terms.With thrilling and tense scenes,the film is a good option for those people who want to have fun without bigger interest.Aliens is just another big production,whose job is to make money in the box-office,not to innovate,like the first,and it's exactly this difference between the two movies that allowed  the second one a better box-office.Beyond the action scenes,there is also the great job of Sigourney Weaver and William Hope,an excellent,competent and talented not known actor.As the lieutenant,he proves he is a spectacular interpreter and that he deserves a better chance in the cinema.Two years after Aliens,William Hope took part in the cast of the shocking Hellbound and made one of the most violent,courageous and well-known scenes of the cinema,where Clare Higgins quashes his nape and sucks his blood through his mouth.",Null,0,0,3 November 1998
The Exorcist," Dramatic and powerful!!
","A famous actress's adolescent daughter is possessed by a demon.Her desperate and frantic mother decides that her child's only chance lays on a old, seen-it-all priest. Horror film that revolutionized the gender and caused great polemic.Director William Friedkin transformed the William Peter Blatty's story in a powerful and frightening visual show about possession and salvation, and changed the conception of how to construct a really scary movie.At the time 'The Exorcist' was filmed, horror flicks were in frank decadence and reduced to Frankenstein and Dracula's films, but Friedkin made the difference with this memorable motion picture and i believe that after Friedkin ,the only movie maker who reached such quality of fear and tension was Clive Barker with 'Hellraiser'. If 'The Exorcist' is in some moments dramatic, in others violent, 'Hellraiser' is a psychological thriller with almost unbearable cruelty ,and as Friedkin, Barker also could count with a terrific cast, beginning with the great and talented english actress Clare Higgins. Good part of 'The Exorcist' quality resides in the cast's dramatic and true actings (to begin with young Linda Blair,who was nominated by the Academy for her role) and to the great special effects, that even have been done through simple and old techniques, surprise and help to show the exorcism's  scenes in a faithful and raw form.'The Exorcist' is not a film recommended for sensitive people. This great public and critic's success had two inferior continuations.",9,1,1,19 July 1999
Good Will Hunting," A touching and great drama written and played by two young and talented young stars!!
","Will Hunting is a rebellious and resentful adolescent, who likes to always be in his friends' company, drinking beer, beating Harvard's boys and knowing girls. What makes Hunting different from the other youths of his age, besides the money and his behavior's problems,is that the boy is owner of a brilliant intelligence, what makes him capable to solve difficult and challenging mathematical problems, to decorate parts of books and many other things.He reads Marx, Pope, Kant and many other famous authors. Will doesn't know how to guide his capability in a productive way, but after a mathematics teacher discovers the boy's potential, he decides to take him to Sean McGuire( Robin Willians,  who wrongly robbed Burt Reynolds' statue in the Oscar night), a hard, intelligent but sensitive psychologist, who has just lost his wife. The two end up building a true friendship, based on trust, and Will will have to evaluate his life and  choose among continuing to go on with his simple life or to open himself for the brilliant future that waits for him... Matt Damon, a young actor, wrote this excellent drama's plot,together with his friend Ben Affleck. In the hands of director Gus Van Sant, 'Good Will Hunting' stayed faithful to the original ideas of the young stars, and it consecrated them as two great promises,due to their latent talent and charisma. Robin Willians gives a contained and thrilling interpretation ,building with effectiveness  a psychologist full of sorrow who, slowly, rediscovers the pleasure that life offers for those who want to get it. Actress Minnie Driver is excellent, portraying the girl who falls in love with Will and tries to make the boy surrender to the love! Gus Van Sant tried to avoid the exaggerations that marked his previous films, and he conducted with professionalism and talent a great film that teaches us something:for more difficult than life sometimes is is, if we count with values such as friendship, love, trust and pardon, is still possible to ennoble the world. Reaching the adolescent and adult public, 'Good Will Hunting' is a thankful surprise!!watch the film, you will like it!!",8,1,4,29 June 1999
Driven," Burt Reynolds saves this film from being a complete mess
","Director Renny Harlin reunite with movie star Sylvester Stallone for this year's blockbuster, Driven, an action-drama about the highly dangerous and thrilling lives of race drivers and the volatile world of automobilism, in which champs are made with the same ease they are destroyed. Driven (known previously as Champs) could have been a better movie, wasn't for its videoclip style (sometimes it's impossible to know what's happening on the screens, there are so many things going on, so many style and so many clever shots that you actually loose your interest for the story itself and watch Driven just for the exhilarating accidents  all well-done and incredible realistic) and some sleazy performances, with the exception of the always excellent Burt Reynolds, by far the best thing in Driven.He actually saved the film from being a complete mess.The story (full os cliches) tells the story of a young rookie driver who is having problems with all the fame and money that comes along the job, and the hard-nosed boss of the team (Burt) calls for the help of Joe Tanto (Stallone), a retired cart driver.It's the typical story of the old-timer who made a lot of mistakes in life and now wants to pass the experience he gained with the bad choices he made to this young troubled man who turns out to be a kid with great potential. Overall, it's ok if you don't expect a lot.",Null,0,1,12 November 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," The importance of friendship!
","Girl, Interrupted is one of the top ten best movies of 1999 (better than the highly overrated American Beauty and the tedious The Green Mile), an involving and interesting drama that catches your attention from start to finish without appealing to over-the-top and exaggerated dramatic scenes.It's a fresh, agile and often funny entertainment that leaves you by the end with a smile on the face .In my point of view, the main theme wasn't the question of 'what's sane and what's insane', the real goal was to show how friendship is important for our lives and how it's imperative to keep a good-heart and be noble and human even at the most disgusting moments of life. In another director's hands, Girl, Interrupted could ended up being the typical Hollywood tear-jerker, but I have to give kudos for James Mangold (the guy responsible for the efficient and underrated Copland), who inspired terrific performances by a great cast (specially by Brittany Murphy, she is an actress you should keep an eye on - expect to hear a lot about this talented, beautiful and charming young woman on the years to come) and told the story in a realistic manner(what makes Girl, Interrupted seems a little bit hard in some parts), but also leaving a positive and upbeat felling in the audiences as the story develops the relationship between the characters. That's when we understand that a friend always makes a difference in our lives.",Null,0,0,4 December 2000

","Politically incorrect,with rude and dirty jokes,a tasty plot and actors in the peak of their talents:'There's something about Mary' contains all these elements, and it's one of the most entertaining and really pleasant films to watch that Hollywood already accomplished in the last years,since 'Naked Gun'. Cameron Diaz became a requested,well-known star after her role in 'My best friends' weeding' and here she is consecrated as a promising and charismatic young woman by playing Mary, the object of desire of practically all the boys on the university!Matt Dillon comes out well and he gives us a good time as a smart and cynic detective,and in doing that, he reveals that he has an excellent timing for comedies!Ben Stiller had in  this film a great chance, and he composes the character with efficiency - he really seems that he isn't just working or in a hard time, he seems to be having a lot of fun, in fact, all the stars seem to be comfortable, and just not acting, they pass to the public the idea that are really having a good time with all that and just not working!the plot is simple and funny: An ingenuous guy (Ben Stiller) falls in love with Mary , spoils everything with the girl in the university's graduation night. Years later, not accepting what happened and still impassioned by the youth, he hires a suspicious detective (Matt Dillon) so that he can trace the girl. But the detective ends up falling in love with her,giving start to a series of confusions,that also involves a colleague of Mary's work and other fans!the scenes are unforgettable: the dog attacking Ben Stiller, the scene of the gel, in which at Mary confuses a certain corporal flowed with gel and...well, I won't say!the pleasure of discovering that surprise is yours, so watch the film today!!!",9,0,0,30 June 1999
The Hurricane," Boring and pretentious c**p
","This is the biography of Rubin `Hurricane' Carter (Denzel Washinton, in a fine performance), a fearless boxer who almost becomes the Champion of the World, 'till he is unjustly accused of murder. He spends twenty two years of his life behind the bars,and then decides to write a book, `The 16th Round', to tell his story to the people. A young, African-American kid (Vicellous Reon Shannon) casually buys a copy of the book and becomes fascinated with Carter's life. He sees some parallel between his life and Carter's life, and the boxer inspires the kid to reach his goals.He decides to help Carter and get him out of the jail, counting with the help of his three Canadian friends (Deborah Unger, Liev Schreiber and John Hannah).The film is a little bit slow and too long. It starts out o.k. and gives an insight in Carter's childhood and how he became the enraged guy he was, but it soon fails miserably when it tries to be too moralist and pretentious.The story could have been told in less than two hours, but filmmaker Norma Jewison, the man behind classics like In the Heat of the Night, directed `Hurricane' in a bureaucratic and tiresome way. Although the basic idea is very interesting, this film doesn't have emotion and strength enough to sustain the patience of the audience for two and a half hour, every year theaters are bombarded with `court room dramas' (like Rules of Engagement, etc.), and this is just one more of them. The performances of a great trio of stars save, in parts, the movie. Rod Steiger has little screen time, but his appearance is powerful and energetic, and his imposing presence helps to elevate the quality of the motion picture. Denzel Washington is very good, but this certainly wasn't a part for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar, he was better in The Bone Collector. Dan Hedaya also has a small part, but he creates a hateful and racist villain. As a whole, 'Hurricane' is an o.k. film that had plenty of possibilities but that ended up screwed by a bad script and an uninspired direction.",Null,1,3,21 September 2000
The Fly," A gruesome and perverse vision of science
","David Cronenberg is a filmmaker whose films you just simply love or hate. He has a peculiar, disturbing, raw and perverse vision of the humanity, and in great part of his motion pictures, explosive and controversial themes like rape, incest, murder and homosexuality are analyzed in a cold and honest way. The Fly's main character is Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum, giving his career's  best performance), a brilliant scientist who works with insistence in the 'Telepods' :two capsules that supposedly are capable of disintegrating a body and transport it to another capsule in which it is reintegrated. Seth meets an attractive and ambitious reporter (Geena Davis) in a party and the two fall in love. She starts to share with him the experiences, but something comes out wrong when Seth uses his own body for the experiment - his genetic cells are mixed up with the DNA of a fly. This is the beginning of a nightmare that will throw Seth in a mutation process. The mutation will turn him progressively into an implacable monster. Cronenberg made a film that doesn't follow the basic formulas of the gender. The Fly is not exactly a horror movie, but a mixture of drama, romance and, of course, a lot of violence, blood and gore. The Fly is so violent that makes Hellbound: Hellraiser 2 look like a Disney film.The magnificent special effects took home the Oscar in 1987, and even after 14 years, the scenes in which Goldblum progressively 'melts down',  shocks for its realism. The director doesn't spare the audience and, unlike The Blair Witch Project, that scared just suggesting, he maintains the cameras in focus, documenting exaggerating cruelty scenes. Jeff Goldblum never delivered such intense acting in all of his career after The Fly. Without a doubt, this film deserves to be a part of any movie lover's collection  - buy the movie. Twentieth Century Fox  did with The Fly the same thing they did for Alien (1979), they released with a lot of excellence a terrific DVD, bringing extras, back stages and an excellent image and sound.",Null,0,1,6 May 2000
Rocky," Whatever makes you cry and fell hope - this film will do this to you!
","After more than twenty years after its release, no other film reached the success and touched so many hearts as Rocky. A genuine B movie that costed one million dollars turned out to be one of the most beautiful and inspiring things ever placed on the screens, Rocky is the result of the effort and determination of Sylvester Stallone, who wrote the story and played the humble and simple-minded boxer who is willing to risk his own life to go the distance for self-respect. Burt Reynolds was in talks to play Rocky, and in spite of me consider myself Burt Reynolds's biggest fan in the whole world, Sylvester Stallone was  the only actor who could give life to that character, because Rocky is in a certain way Stallone's own history. At the time, Stallone  worked in films of third category and  suddenly,after the risk he took to star in Rocky, he became one of the greatest Hollywood's stars.This touching, old-fashioned film tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a guy who really never had any chance in his life.Rocky is a small-time boxer, he fights in clubs and also lives in a poor neighborhood. Everyone humiliates Rocky, including Mickey (Burgess Meredith, in a terrific performance), his trainer : 'you've got heart but you fight like a goddamn ape!', Mickey yells at Rocky. Then something happens. Rocky has his life turned upside down when, for some reason of the destiny, the indestructible heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Creed chooses the 'Italian Stallion' for an exhibition fight, that actually should be just a show for Apollo. But for Rocky, the fight is not just a show, but the last chance that he has to show to the world that any loser has the chance to conquer redemption. In the day of the fight, the arrogant Apollo is surprised by the small-time boxer who not only goes the whole distance with the champion ,but also teaches a lesson Apollo will never forget. Rocky is one of the greatest films of the century - excellent performances, a superb direction by John G. Avildsen, an involving and touching story and beautiful moments that will stay in your hearts forever - who can forget Rocky's running up the steps of the museum of Philadelphia and Bill Conti's unforgettable song, or even the scene in which Mickey (Burgess Meredith), the old trainer who never gave a chance to Rocky, lowly asks for forgiveness.

The Untouchables," Director Brian De Palma's finest, years before Mission to Mars!
","I reviewed The Untouchables about a year ago, but after watching it yesterday on television,I felt I had to do another review, because I perceived a narrative quality that I hadn't notice in the first time I saw it. The movie marked me, specially due some brutal action scenes (who can forget the gruesome moment in which the underrated Billy Drago blows away Sean Connery with a machine gun?), but The Untouchables isn't just about style.Well, the movie is undoubtly a stylish and violent thriller, but that's no surprise, since De Palma is known for his peculiar way of making films, it has masterful performances, and although some people say that Robert De Niro was terrible as Capone, in my opinion he did one hell of a job. His Capone is as menacing, cynic and tough as the Jimmy Conway of Goodfellas.Sean Connery was great too, Malone, his character, was the toughest one of 'the crew' and his performance was terrific, controlled and true-to-life because when you watch the film, you are actually absorbed by the way De Palma develops Malone's relationship and friendship with Costner's character, and you realize that in the end, Costner's character isn't the same man he was, he took a lot of his old friend with him.In the end, you actually feel that you've known each one of those characters, and you fell sorry for the fate of some unfortunate members of the team and glad for the success of the others who survived.Brian De Palma is acclaimed for his technique in delivering complex takes and thrilling tension, but here he also managed to give space for the actors to give stand-out performances and he also knew how to tell a good story without letting his personal visual and technique abilities to get in the way of the plot, something he didn't achieved in Mission to Mars.",Null,0,0,9 November 2000

'The Untouchables' was filmed with exuberance and talent by film director Brian DePalma. Agile and full of action, 'The Untouchables' shines and thrills, be through its rhythm, be through its performances.Connery and De Niro transform the film in a memorable show, a faithful picture of the 1930's Chicago, a study on the Mafia and about the personality and the men's who decided to challenge it interior motivation, taking a risk and challenging all the dangers. Pretty and dramatic music, detailed picture and rebuilding of  time and an experienced and vigorous direction consecrates 'The Untouchables' as a classic, in spite of being excessively violent. The death of Malone, who is killed by a gangster who strafes him copiously, is frightening and shocking and when Ness holds his hand and promises revenge, we felt that the action will begin. 'Your friend died like an Irish pig, you think on that when the jury acquits me...', the murderer of Malone comments, happy and cynic, for Ness. Costner catches him and pulls him of the top of a building, the man drops over a car and squashes the head: at this time, Ness and DePalma show that nobody is above the law, and that the action will begin!!'The Untouchables' i rated for extreme violence and language.The cast: Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith and Sean Connery.",Null,0,1,3 May 1999
Scream," The movie that reestablished the horror gender's authority
","Quality rating: *** out of ***** (three out of five). It's interesting to watch Scream, because this was the movie that reestablished the authority of the horror gender. After the tremendous success of Wes Craven's film, Hollywood delivered to us Urban Legend, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 3. Some of those movies were great, others were just rip-offs made to profit from the box-offices. Scream is an entertaining thriller, and the greatest goal of it is to quote the stereotypes of those kinds of films. There are many references, from Halloween to Hellraiser, and Scream is specially delicious for those who really enjoy not just bloody pictures, but also cinema in general.The dialogues are sharp and funny, and the energy and talent offered by the young cast brings strength for the motion picture. Wes Craven increases suspense and fear in some sequences and he does succeed to create memorable moments, honoring masters like Alfred Hitchcok. Neve Campbell is a good actress, and the supporting cast is great as well, but the problem is that the plot was a little bit previsible.Anyway, this is what Craven wanted, once his film is , above all, a tribute to the horror flicks.Overall, Scream is one of the most entertaining, fast-paced and valuable films from the nineties.",Null,0,0,4 February 2000

Final Destination," Excellent film, a knock-your-socks-off thriller!
","When I first went to see Final Destination at the theaters I really didn't expect much of anything, just a variation of I Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream. Not that those films are bad, I really enjoyed Scream and all the 'Summer' movies, but the formula was getting very predictable instead of appealing. Urban Legend was an example of a bad 'offspring' of those new teen horror films. But Final Destination holds its on records. It's a sharp, tense thriller, you really get a lot of chilling scenes and surprises along the way!in this movie, you don't have a maniac trying to kill sex-starved teenagers with a knife. You have a more powerful killer. The death. The thing that makes Final Destination so original and fresh is that you really never know when the surprises will jump right out of the screen. You don't have a lot of gore like, for example, you have in Hellbound Hellraiser 2 (another excellent horror film, check it out), but the way the people die will really scare the hell out of you!Final Destination is an original very well-written story, and you also have terrific performances, an excellent director and a very good production. I highly recommend this great thriller!",Null,0,0,28 July 2000
The Truman Show," Laura Linney at her best!
","A few months ago,before the release of the Truman Show,I read reviews that acclaimed the film as the most interesting and brilliant film ever done by Hollywood.I thought that those reviews were really impressive,after all,to receive the label of one of the greatests films ever done,certainly the story should have been very well related in the screen and the cast should have helped a lot.The names in the cast didn't impress me:I've never liked Jim Carrey,Ed Harris was a good but not brilliant actor,and they also had a young actress who worked in Congo and who I have already seen before in smaller roles,like in Dave.Her name was Laura Linney.But I admired a lot Peter Weir,and when I knew he was the director,I concluded that,well,the film could be what the critics were saying and writing.He had already done one striking movie,Fearless.I watched the Truman Show three times,but not for thinking that the film was a masterful piece of storytelling.I agree that we're not talking about a horrible movie,but also the film isn't excellent.We have here a good movie,with good moments,but,when analyzed conjointly,doesn't compensate.It is just another big and expensive box-office attraction that tries to be original and innovate,but tied up into the big studio's system of making movie in a commercial sense,it  ends up being the kind of movie Peter Weir wanted to avoid.He wasted the possibility of constructing an unforgettable drama,and made a weak comedy.I watched it three times because I saw a magisterial interpretation that came from I less expected:Laura Linney.As Jim Carrey's wife,she created a memorable character,always with a giant smile engraved on her face.She should be nominated as best supporting actress and she should take the Oscar home.She builds her character as a woman who,despite her beauty,her caress devoted to her husband and her impressive smile,hides the truth from him,sustains him under her control,involves him with her personality,fights to make him give away his suspecions,but,gradually,begins to fell compassion for him.Laura Linney managed a smiling woman into the most astonishing character I've seen.",7,0,0,2 November 1998
Jackie Brown," Could have been better
","This surprising adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch marked a new phase in Quentin Tarantino's career. Without the agile rhythm, the nervous and accelerated edition nor the comic and brutal characters that consecrated his previous works, Tarantino delivers a contained film, centered in the excellent cast's performance (led by two veteran actors who, although famous during the seventies, were in frank decadence, Pam Grier and Robert Forster).Robert De Niro is excellent as a cruel and merciless murderer, and in spite of having few lines and time on the screen, he should have been reminded by the Academy for this performance (the scene in which he kills Bridget Fonda is memorable) . The same can be said about Samuel L. Jackson, who plays with generous doses of humor and meanness the dangerous trafficker. Over all, Jackie Brown is a modest and curious entertainment, but that could have been better.",Null,0,0,22 December 1999
