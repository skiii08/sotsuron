Blade Runner 2049," A real disappointment
","I loved original but I have to say I really hated this one. From movie music score to plot and cinematography - everything was a disappointment. The music score (loud noise) and cinematography was especially heavy handed in trying to force drama when it was not warranted by plot. Instead of so much CGI producers should have spent some $ on a better script and director. A bad movie should not be this long, people walked out at my showing.",1,81,168,9 October 2017
