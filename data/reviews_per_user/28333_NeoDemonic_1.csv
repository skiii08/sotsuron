Iron Man 3," Wish it were good but turned out bad.Mandarin was such a promising character
","Shane Blake does not like the comic book Iron Man and even less the character of Mandarin and he proves it in this Iron Man 3 where it shows that anyone can be Iron Man (Pepper Potts, Kilian and even the President of the United United (yes, really). and the worst part is the treatment he inflicts on the character of the Mandarin he hates above all. a shame, a shame, a betrayal. The biggest problem that people have with this movie seems to be an awful representation of the main villain. This particular aspect is bad in its own right, but, honestly, I think this movie's problem go far beyond that specific gripe that people have. My problem with this failure of film is its defective writing, poor conceptualization, dull characters, inconsistent tone, lack of intelligence and thematic integrity. Iron Failure 3 is as superficial and trivial as you can get. Depth in this movie is non- existent. Character motivation is flat. The characters themselves are poorly written cardboard figures with no personality. There is no stakes and no tension. Everything is paint by numbers and generic. As for the controversial miss-handling of the main villain, which many defenders of this movie have described as an act of brilliancy, because it had some imaginary message behind it, I have my opinion on that.The only hidden message that this movie gave us, is that Shane Black should never again direct another comic book movie. I guess people think about that meaningless plot-point too much. Iron Man 3 is not a Dark Knight, when you can write a book about all the subliminal meanings behind the film. Iron Man 3 is a cookie-cuter, generic, uninventive schlock. Maybe the idea behind this 'hidden message' looked good in a concept, but the execution is what kills any potential for this to be taken seriously. It's like with the Prometheus, which had great ideas, but the execution of those ideas was flat and dull. Iron Man 3 was even worse than that. I am fully aware, as a few other people with actual brain cells, that this cheap option was not executed well and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have.Iron Man 3 is generic, cheesy, poorly written mess with no actual depth. If Shane Black, who is definitely not someone who has brilliant writing and directing skills, intended to mock the perception of terrorism in society, he would have an entire film dedicated on exploration of that. But he's too dumb and generic to actually make something good out of that concept. People are giving simply some generic excuses for the fact that Shane Black did very poor execution with the story and the conceptuality of the film (which it didn't really had).",3,0,0,9 May 2016
