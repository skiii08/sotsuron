Captain Phillips," Superb, tense, frustrating and exciting!
","My word does Tom Hanks play his part to perfection in this film. And Barkhad Abdi does a fine job and is worthy of mention in this superb film. The tension is great, the frustration when opportunities are missed and the excitement of the whole film is unmissable in my opinion.The casting for the film was perfect, someone get the best for the film and did this true story great credit. I bought it (as with all the films I review) and would happily recommend you add it to your collection. This film will take you on a journey not just on a ship but through your emotions because it draws you in and its like being there but you are totally helpless! Yes, I did find myself shouting at the screen a few times in frustration because the film is so involving.",10,0,2,30 January 2017
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Boring, dull, dreary and miserable.
","I had high expectations for this film.A fine cast, great story and more. However, I have to admit the film did nothing at all for me and it took me three attempts to sit through it. I finally managed to watch the entire film the other day. And boy was I ready to see the credits roll! The music score in my opinion added to my misery, the acting was very staid and cold. It wasn't 'stiff upper lip' British, it was bored actors trying to be even more boring. I gave the film 1 star. Watch the film if you like confusion, flash backs, grey atmosphere, no tension or need to fall asleep. And if you like the film then fine, if you don't then I told you so! Within ten minutes you will know if you will watch the rest.",1,2,4,30 January 2017
Blow," Not the usual guns blazing drug film.
","The trailer foe film was just enough to tempt me in and I wasn't disappointed.Some parallels I thought with Goodfellas which is a great film. I thought the acting was authentic and credit where it's due Depp did a great job or portraying Jung. I want to mention Ray Liotta because he played a part that represented a side to the story where the George was clearly influenced by his father. To that end Liotta played the all American dad who was proud of his son and tried to do his best for him.The music balance in the film was spot on, not too much or too loud and the story line flowed and kept me interested all the way through. And the production I think reflected the period of time very well indeed.I am happy to recommend the film to all, it's an interesting story with a moral theme running through that may reflect the other side of crime for those pondering going into the drug trade.",8,2,3,23 March 2019
The Godfather," Brilliant
","My reviews are designed to be short, sweet and to the point and this is my first! Superb cast, all the actors played their characters convincingly and with authority. Some people may find the length of the film too long but in my opinion there isn't a dull moment. This film is both classy and brutal at the same time and nothing and nobody should turn down an offer they cannot refuse. Considering the problems encountered in the making of the film, Coppola does a fine job and the film is a well deserved masterpiece that should be in everybody's collection. All I can say to you now is, if you haven't seen it yet, go and buy it!",10,0,0,30 January 2017
