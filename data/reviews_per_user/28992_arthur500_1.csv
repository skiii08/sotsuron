The New World," This movie is bad
","Watching the trailers for this movie makes you think your going to be watching a great film like 'Last of the Mohicans' or 'The Last Samurai'. Instead you get a discovery channel documentary on nature. Half the bloody movie is scenes that only show trees. And for those of you thinking there is war scenes in this movie, don't get your hopes up. The amount of action in this movie rounds up to about only 10 minutes tops. The rest is Colin Farrell and Pocahontas hugging each other in the grass smiling narrating rhetorical questions in their minds that get pretty annoying. Now I bet there are some art students out there reading this who are just dying to reply to this by saying, 'YOU Don't UNDERSTAND ART!' - well, if more than half the people watching this garbage left the theatre I was in, that's got to mean something. Never in my life have I seen so many people walk out of the theatre.",4,3,12,22 January 2006
