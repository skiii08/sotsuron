Alien 3," I'm not a fan of the others but I really like this one
","Acting 10/10, Characters 10/10, Atmosphere 8/10, Drama 7/10, Action 8/10, Concept 5/10.ExSample; *Acting - Feels very real and logical in their situations. *Chars - A bunch of mainjack criminals with a religious leader is always an interesting combination. *Atmo - Serious attitudes together in an abandoned jail in a cold planet... *Drama - a Little bit of love and friendship but most of all betray and death. *Action - Aliens likes to eat flesh meat. *Concept - Aliens likes to eat flesh meat and no vegetarian.If you upgrade Alien1 and 2, and then you mix them together, add some drama and better chars. W'ola', you got Alien3.So if you'r not a big fan in the firsts slow motion nor the seconds nonstop action,, this could still save your Saturday night evening if you give it a shot! 7.5/10",9,6,7,31 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," watching-one-time-only-at,cinema-with-lots-of,POPCORN
","a VERY deeecent movie, whoms jumpyness was quite imageable to 'The hobbits'. = You just HAVE to accept what is happening no matter how ridiculously-convenient eVEry FU_KING scene is.Pros 1: Quality/Graphics in scenes, especially the action scenes. 2: Realism from the short acting of 'Peter Parkers' dad. 3: The Character who became 'Electro', felt very spot on and realistic. 4: 'The scientist' felt very spot on whoms character-presence reminded me of heath ledgers 'Joker' in batman. (I would liked to see more of him) 5: I liked the kid-spider in the end. He compensated for the retarded Rhino-robot which was controlled by a Russian drunkard, or just a Russian...Cons 1: A lot... Except those pros I wrote above,, the movie was very plastic. It is made for watching-one-time-only-at-the-cinema-with-popcorn-and- lemonade",6,7,17,20 April 2014
Godzilla," A good movie with '2012'-vibes
","I had a pretty good time at the cinema..: dno how to explain this movie,,; its actually quite empty, very similar feeling as to the movie '2012'. The humans can't really do much but watch the forces coming. -- And that is exactly what you do as a viewer -> U watch the futile humans, either running, or throwing tomatoes at these forces. But the movie Godzilla has some intensity and some conspiracy inherent that fits my liking.The overall message from this movie is the same as from all other UBER_MoVIES = 'no matter how strong, yet so weak'.A little bit better than '2012' which was a OK-good movie too.6.8/10",7,5,13,14 May 2014
