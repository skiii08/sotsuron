The Blair Witch Project," Overrated piece of trash
","I didn't like this movie at all. It's really boring and not scary one bit. The only thing scary about this movie is how overrated it is. What's so scary about people saying the 'F' word too many times? NOTHING. I could make a better movie than this, A MUCH BETTER MOVIE!!! Believe me, this film was a complete waste of time.I give this film 2 out of 10",Null,1,2,22 July 2000
Batman Returns," This movie is good
","This is a good Batman movie. Don't listen to the people who dislike this movie. This movie isn't as good as the original, but it's much better than the STUPID third and fourth movie. This batman movie is dark, that's what I like about it. The other sequels are too childish and colorful. This is a good sequel and the only good Batman sequel. I recommended you to watch this movie and the first. Please skip the other sequels, they SUCK!!!I give this film 7 out of 10. I give The first Batman a 8. I give Batman Forever a 3. I give Batman and Robin a 1.",Null,0,0,4 August 2000
Home Alone," Dull and Unfunny
","This movie sucks! What's so funny about two burglars getting hurt by wire booby traps that a little kid set up. Nothing at all. The jokes on this movie were not funny at all, maybe a person with a IQ of two or lower will find this movie somewhat funny. The other sequels are the same thing, people getting hurt by booby traps. It's the same thing over and over again. AVOID!!!!!I give this movie 3 out of 10",Null,4,8,7 October 2000
Scary Movie 2," Really disappointing!
","I liked the first film, but this one is horrible. All of the very funny scenes I've already seen on the commericals. The beginning scene of the movie is pretty funny, the spoof of The Exorcist. The movie went downhill after that. The foul-mouthed parrot is the only saving grace of the entire film.I give this movie 2 out of 10",Null,0,1,6 July 2001

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," as bad as the original
","oh no! Not this again. The same thing happens in this movie, the two same burglar from the last movie get hurt by booby traps set by the same kid. The only thing different about this movie, Kevin is lost at New York city instead of him staying at home alone. It's the same movie really with a different story. Don't watch this movie. You won't be missing anything.I give this movie 3 out of 10",Null,0,1,7 October 2000
