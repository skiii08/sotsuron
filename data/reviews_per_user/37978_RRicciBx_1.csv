United 93," United 93 - Basically An Acceptable Movie
","While this movie was a good portrayal of 9-11 events, too much film time was devoted to the World Trade Center & Pentagon strikes leading up to this fourth aircraft's plight, which was the main subject and tribute to those aboard who died. Approximately 25% of the movie viewing time was shown aboard United 93. Although tense viewing, with a bedlam finale to take passenger control of the aircraft,little is shown of any personal interaction between the hijackers and passengers, which might have occurred. Since surviving relatives must view the brave actions concerned, any possible pleading of passengers to hijackers was dispensed with.",7,1,4,2 May 2006
