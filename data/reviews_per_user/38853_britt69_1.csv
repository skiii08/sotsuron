The Ring," Unbelievably scary
","I am not a person to get scared easily by movies- I have seen everything from Vampires and Scream to The Exorcist and was not even mildly affected by any of them. But this movie really did it for me.For the next HOUR after viewing the ring -on a warm Sunday afternoon I might add- my heart was racing so much I thought I was having palpitations. My friend andrea who saw it with me (who also has a history of immunity towards horror films)and I were speechless, and andrea jumped as her phone rang as we were exiting the cinema. For ages after that we kept saying 'oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh' and stuttering in awe. A movie has never before affected me even a fraction as much as The Ring did, as we speak I am in fact home from school because I could not sleep a wink last night from fear.
So, just a warning to anyone out there planning on seeing this movie- you better be damn tough.",10,0,0,10 February 2003
