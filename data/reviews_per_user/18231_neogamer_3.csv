Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Andy Kaufman for the new generation? A 'how-to view' review
","'Borat' is a very challenging movie in many ways, you can tell by the amount of criticisms and lawsuits it received.==What is the film?== What the film is is pretty simple, it's a mix of mockumentary and candid camera. Borat goes around doing some outrageous things that may be new to him, or is normal in his fictitious Kazakh homeland. He does so even when there are no joke targets, thus making the joke on him as well as on the participants.==Mixed reviews== Now, you may wonder why so many people are applauding it, whilst a whole lot are opposing it. The explanation is simple, it's too new of a concept to grasp. When 'Da Ali G' show came out, I was puzzled. It wasn't 'ha-ha' funny, but more like 'is he for real?' At this point in time, the humor is too new for a newbie viewer. However, after a couple of viewings and understanding the logic, flow and humor behind it, you find it to be a pretty clever work. The puzzlement placed by the 'ignorant' participants and the absurdity of the comments by Cohen is just great.If you are used to the new humor, you will love it. If you have lived in a nutshell in Death Valley reading the same book over and over again for the last 30 odd years, you may have no idea why this film is funny. To those who are that, it is important to look at the new things in life, for humor does and needs to evolve.==Andy==People may find him in relations with Andy Kaufman, the dada-esquire comedian of the 70-80's. No one gets the joke, unless you are in on it. Thus Cohen/Borat has revived the strange humor from the dead, and has succeeded it brilliantly.By the way, this film contains one of the best fight scenes ever, in which I would like to award Ken Davitian for 'Best Supporting Actor' for not breaking out of his role.",9,1,6,4 February 2007
Akira," Best Japanimation
","I've seen a couple of Japanimation movies, but I guess I like this the best. It has everything a good sci-fi wants. There are many gruesome scenes, but that's what reality during war/anarchy is like, a bunch of gore. No animation has reached the standards of this movie yet (perhaps except for Miyazaki's movie).",10,0,1,28 March 2001
Being John Malkovich," why didnt they give the best script to this movie?
","American Beauty was good, but didn't this movie have a better plot? more original than any other movie of that year? It's as twisted as Alice in Wonderland, but modern and more surreal.Many give the credits of this film to Spike Jonze, i don't know why, i prefer to give it charlie kaufman for his plot, his originality just stood outeverybody in the movie was strong and powerful, in terms of acting. Loved the scene with the chimpanzee's flashback.gave it 10/10",10,0,1,28 March 2001
