Resident Evil: Afterlife," What just happened, Matrix in slow-mo??
","I'm a big fan of zombie movies and especially Resident Evil, so I'm sad to write this review.I honestly don't fully comprehend what I just saw. It feels like the only thing that the director wrote down in his notepad for executing this movie was; lots and lots of macho music and action ---> clever before-fight line from an actor ---> more macho music and action on slow motion. The characters of this movie were dull and had no personality. You can't feel any sympathy for them or relate to them in any way. At least I couldn't. In the earlier Resident Evil movies the main point was to follow how people react to mass destruction and it was all about survival. Or at least thats how I saw it. The Umbrella stuff was always there but in Afterlife the 'plot' is all about the fight between umbrella and normal people in middle of zombieland. And talk about errors.. When Claire was fighting with the Axe guy I was happily surprised when she blinked her eyes every time she fired her gun. But in the end when Chris and Claire are shooting Wesker, she has a stone cold face and doesn't blink even once.This newest Resident Evil is missing all the fun, all the excitement, all that made sense and all the compassionate characters. It just feels like it's trying to bring all the characters from the games in the middle of a big messy pile of matrix in slow-mo that you call Resident Evil: Afterlife.",3,5,11,6 December 2010
