Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Lucas' muse?
","I think Cecil B. De Mille's ghost must have been whispering into George Lucas' ear during the production of this epic. It has a cast of millions (of species). Well, Cec certainly influenced the grandeur of the sets, special effects and production scale but, fortunately, Lucas chose Liam Neeson rather than Charlton Heston for the starring role. It was a good flick - given that it is the first of the series - by the time he gets to episode six he should (did) do better. It is worth seeing, though it drags in places. The menagerie was especially terrific. I freaked out in the part among the 'goldfish bowls'. Boy, am I gonna have some real interesting nightmares from now on !",7,0,0,19 May 1999
Black Book," Historically good, but...
","Although mostly a downer, I thoroughly enjoyed this film except for one stinging implausibility: that of the liberating Canadian Colonel cooperating with German General Käutner.After Canadians experienced Nazi 'honor' via Dieppe, Ortona, the Abbey Ardenne, the Battle for the Scheldt Estuary, and seeing the starved Dutch people, I find it impossible to believe that a Canadian officer would respect such a pre-capitulation order by a defeated Nazi scum. Other than this incongruity, the film's depiction of the mixed and often ephemeral allegiances of a many Dutch civilians, the double-crossing by some, the idealism of others, in the nightmare vortex of Nazi occupation was certainly illuminating.I wonder if citizens of my own country, Canada, would do any better when faced by such a tragic situation as those of the Netherlands experienced in the five full years from May 10, 1940 to May 5, 1945.",8,6,8,8 July 2007
Troy," deja vu?
","Hmm, after a while I sort of expected Golem to appear. But then, good actors are had to find, so you use the decent ones you've discovered over and over. Its been a while since I read the Iliad, but most of the movie  seemed to be more or less faithful to Homer's plot (except, maybe, the ending). I'd particularly like to complement the set designers, those were damn functional yurts on the beach, and I don't recall seeing that many ships assembled before, even in WW II D-Day photos. Also, I liked the way that Petersen developed the viewer's appreciation of how the weaknesses and strengths of the major characters changed over the course of the movie.  At the beginning I pigeonholed Achilles as a bloodthirsty status seeking dork. By the end I realized he was a noble bloodthirsty status seeking dork with a conscience. Helen of Troy's character, though pretty, didn't really ring my chimes at all. very 2- dimensional she was. But, all in all, the whole shebang was worth the price of a ticket.",7,0,0,17 May 2004
The Imitation Game," LGBT tale, not really history, but interesting anyway.
","This is more a story about 'Rainbows' than about decryption technology. Important events such as the first Bomba's developed in 1938 by Polish Cipher Bureau cryptologist Marian Rejewski and colleagues Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki were ignored, as were the contributions of the vast staff of Bletchley Park and related organizations.Turing's role was formidable, but only part of the secret intelligence war that produced 'Ultra'. This is not a war history film, it is an oversimplified biography of Turing, a much more complex individual than the one depicted by actor Benedict Cumberbatch. Nonetheless, Cumberbatch did a very credible performance despite the limitations of his script.",6,3,4,15 January 2017
Sausage Party," Extremely crude cartoon parodying politics, religion, sexual mores, etc
","Utter piece of sh*t, but underlying philosophies expressed are, mostly, worthwhile. I look forward to the Brits cleaning up the script and producing their own TASTEFUL much wittier version. (Not that I'd bother watching it.) This intellectually obscene flick was painful garbage to sit through. Only watched it out of curiosity as how just how crude some American filmmakers can be just to make a buck.",5,0,3,1 April 2017
