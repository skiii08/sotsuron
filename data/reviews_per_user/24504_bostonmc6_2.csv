The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay part 1 review
",(WARNING: THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS!) (Please do not go further if you don't want to be spoiled!) So the movie starts off slow. But it shows District 13 and who's here and what happened there. It was very intense because i thought the movie will be boring but it wasn't. I wished they change the parts of the book so more people can be in it. I was happy Effie was in there but like Peeta and Johanna were that not much in it. Later on in the movie it was pretty cool because when they went to go rescue peeta and the other tributes the rebels went in like the black ops. I rated this movie a 7 because there wasn't that much action like catching fire it was boring the first 30 minutes. I wish the director could've just added more parts of the book like the districts fighting back or more peacekeepers. In the end it left of with a cliffhanger so I can't wait for next year.,7,7,25,21 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," The best Marvel movie Ever
","(Warning this review may contain spoilers!) Guardians of the galaxy was probably my favorite movie of the year Because this movie was so funny i almost cried. I think this Movie was better than Captain America the winter solider. (WARNING THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) I liked the part when they showed Thanos in a chair talking to Ronan and Loki's boss in the avengers. I hope Marvel would do a guardians of the galaxy and Avengers 3 in Later Avengers sequels.I think this was the funniest movie i have ever seen. (WARNING THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) Maybe if they put in a different end credits scene it would've been better. So Overall this Movie Was funny, Outstanding, Creative, Smart, and Action-packed. I cant wait until the sequel Comes out. So for those people who haven't seen it go and see it before Avengers comes out.",9,3,8,5 August 2014
