The Blair Witch Project," Where's the movie?
","The Blair Witch Project is an over hyped B-minus student work at best.  It does not scare.  It does not entertain.  It is a pathetic story of three people who become lost in the Maryland woods during the fall.  They don't have any basic survival skills or any ability to support each other during their crisis. The characters go around in circles shouting, 'F**k you!' at each other to demonstrate their intelligence.  The movie didn't make want to root for anyone.The idea was good--the delivery nonexistent.Sundance not withstanding, Ed Wood could have helped this filmIf you want to see quality in a low budget movie, see 'The Brothers McMullen' or 'Clerks'.",1,1,3,10 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Bruce Willis can act!
","Excellent movie.  This film holds your attention as you try to figure out where the plot will lead.  It can be scary, especially for young children. Well crafted, directed, edited and acted.  Willis was impressive.  This film showcased his talent in ways that his other films did not.  I hope he is given more serious roles in the future.Haley Joel Osment was superb.",10,0,0,27 August 1999
