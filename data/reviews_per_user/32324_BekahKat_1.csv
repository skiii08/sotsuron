Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My story
","I didn't used to like Star Wars, but my brother is who got me interested in it all.I wasn't born when the original three came out, so I didn't even know about it then, but my brother was really into it.When I was about 9 this movie came out and of coarse I didn't like because I was only interested in Barbie dolls and things of that nature.My brother (Adam)would talk about it non-stop and it got on my nerves SOOOO bad and I finally watched it for him. I HATED it.Then when I was like 12 Attack of the Clones came out and it seemed kind-of cool.So I gave Star Wars a chance and watched the first one while Adam was at the theaters watching the second one.I fell in love with the movie and watched the 1,2and 3rd ones ALL the way through.I'm not finished watching 4,5,6, but i'll get there.Hopefully one day I will get to have all the movies on DVD in the same case and watch them all day long and have a Star Wars movie fest!Thad be awesome.I bet the DVD set would cost like $200 or more.Well hope you liked my story!",10,1,2,22 April 2006
