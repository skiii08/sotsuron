Ali," Good, but not The Greatest
","Do not expect to see a boxing movie, expect to see a movie about a boxer. And not only about any boxer but probably the greatest boxer of all times and also a great civil rights fighter, probably one of the most important and influential ones, which at least surprised me when I saw Ali.There is not a lot of boxing in Ali, but the boxing you will see is ultra realistic (forget the Rocky-style boxing, blocking with the face) and I found the scenes very exciting and well done. There is also a good assassination scene. The combining of sound and pictures is brilliant in Ali and it shows already in the beginning, good enough to give you shivers and the music works as an ignitor of feelings in the same way as in a gospel church.
Even though the movie is more about Ali himself than his achievements in the ring, we will not follow him for more than about ten years and (unfortunately) there is nothing about the beginning of his career or what happened afterwards (maybe just as well). The acting is absolutely first class, Will Smith is phenomenal, which shows that a good director like Mann (remember Heat, the movie that among other things contains the best robbery scene of all movies, except The Long Riders) can bring out hidden talent. Of Course Jon Voight is very good, but he is always good even if the movie is not (Anaconda) and when the movie is good (i.e. Runaway Train) he is remarkable.I would have preferred an even longer movie with more boxing and maybe a little shorter scenes from Zaire prior to the Rumble in the Jungle, except the scene where Ali is moved by the support from the common people in the street of Zaire, which I found emotional and important for the movie.I was disappointed that we didn't get too see the whole match against Joe Frazier and nothing of what happened in the rings after Zaire. I also think that it would have been beneficial for the excitement if Mann had chosen to show us how Foreman crushed his opponents prior to the Ali fight.My rating is a weak 8 / 10. Younger people and those who only want action will be disappointed. Otherwise I think Ali can interest the mature viewer even if he/she is not a boxing enthusiast.",6,0,0,24 May 2002
Training Day," Nice to see Washington when he is not so nice
","Very good cop movie. I was tired of seeing Denzel Washington as Mr. Nice Guy in movie after movie so it feels very refreshing to see him get his fingers dirty. But is he a little dirty or very dirty ? Maybe he is only doing what is needed in a society gone bad ? Training Day has a brutal and serious atmosphere. The dialogue and acting is good, the pacing is rather high and there is some good violence and very threatening and suspenseful situations. U.S.A. sure seems to have some really dangerous neighbourhoods. Training Day is certainly better than most Hollywood cop movies. I also want to recommend 15 Minutes and The Negotiator. Rating: 9/10",9,3,14,3 March 2002
The Others," Do not read too much about it, just watch it
","The only weakness of The Others is if you know too much about the plot so I will not give away any details about it.Here is what you need to know: The Others is not aimed at the younger audiences, it is not an action movie nor does it contain fancy special effects make up or monsters. It is not a violent movie, but it is creepy and have some scares. It is very well acted and directed, it manages to create a very interesting and moody atmosphere, it uses sound effects skillfully and it will keep you interested and entertained throughout the whole movie.
The story is clever and so is the ending. Unfortunately the same can not be said about those reviewers who are giving away too much about the plot here on IMDb and who make obvious comparisons with another movie which also can ruin your experience of The Others, so don't read any more, just watch The Others. I urge you who are writing reviews here to stop inventing your own rating systems and use the official 10 grade scale of IMDb. My rating of The Others: 9/10.",8,0,0,3 March 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Good actors, bad and boring movie
","The big problem with this movie is the story. It takes too long to get going, the preparations before the robbery are not very interesting, there are too many characters so none of them becomes interesting and the robbery turns out to be unrealistic and very little exciting.George Clooney does the same role as he always does, the cool guy, but he is not very cool or impressing here. Elliot Gold is more interesting and odd but gets very little screen time and the chinese guy amuses us a few moments. Brad Pitt has done many impressing roles (12 Monkeys, Kalifornia, Snatch, Fight Club and Seven just to mention some of his best movies)and the same can be said about Matt Damon but none of them get anything to work with in this movie. Andy Garcia is as good as he can be in his role as the bad guy, but why doesn't we get to see him actually do anything bad ? Julia Roberts character is only boring too see, she could have been replaced with any female actor and it would not have made any difference. But replaced with Halle Berry we would at least have had someone beautiful to look at.
Ocean's Eleven is a remake of the 1960 movie with the same name. You can see the oldfashioned overlaping of scenes and you can here it from the oldfashioned crappy music. I have not seen the original but the new version is a typical example of replacing good story with a bunch of star actors. No one would bother with this movie if the actors were not so famous.I recommend that you watch The Score instead, it has the three greatest actors in the world and here the actors really make a difference, especially Edward Norton but it is always a pleasure too see De Niro and Brando as well. The Score has a much superior story, a very exciting robbery and a superb ending.My rating of Ocean's Eleven is 4 / 10.",3,0,2,12 April 2002
Mulholland Drive," Non mainstream surrealistic atmospheric drama
","If you dislike movies that are not explaining everything to you, that leaves you with questions unanswered and different possible explanations of what was actually happening then you better avoid Mulholland Dr. The same thing goes if you are demanding a lot of action, but if you appreciate a superbly directed drama where you get to think for yourself without getting everything spelled out for you, then Mulholland Dr. might be something for you.Mulholland Dr. has so many highly entertaining scenes if you appreciate the combination of good dialogue and good acting, but if I am forced to mention a few it would be Adam Keshers meeting with The Cowboy (excellent dialogue) and his meeting with the Castigliane brothers (the expresso scene is so marvelously twisted). Normally I hate when movies shows musical performances to fill up the screen time but the audition scene in MD is very well performed and the singers are sexy and charismatic. Another favourite scene is when the big bully enters Adam Keshers house like a living bulldozer or when Cookie tells Adam that whoever he is hiding from they know where he is or... there are so many favourite scenes, I can't mention them all.. OK, but just a couple more; the hitjob scene is very funny if you have a sense for black humor and the ability to laugh when people are getting murdered and the very short scene with the hooker asking for a cigarette is simply marvelous, she is so genuine and still I can't help being amazed that there are people like her right here on Earth. (She appears to be like a child mentally but she has the oldest profession in the world and she 'takes a cigarette though').
Lynch also uses music masterfully, creating a thick and mysterious atmosphere, just to sit back and enjoy. Now I came to think about a couple of more scenes that I just have to mention; the lesbian scene is very believable and very hot and the scene where a man and his friend follow up on a dream, it would not be in a normal Hollywood movie, it is not essential for the story, but it is good, it is highly entertaining, mysterious and Mulholland Dr. is not your normal Hollywood movie.I don't claim that I have understood everything in Mulholland Dr., I am just a human and I have only seen the movie once (although I have seen some of the above mentioned scenes at least five times), but MD is so entertaining that it is not necessary to understand everything. My unanswered questions only acts like a bonus, a motivation to watch the movie again.The sheer number of reviews on IMDb of Mulholland Dr. (663 at the moment) is an indicator of the fact that this is a movie with impact, you will no be indifferent after seeing it, I think you will either love or hate it. Recommended for mature audiences only. Kids and action fanatics will be bored. My rating is 9 / 10, with more violence it would have been a 10.",9,1,3,8 June 2002
Blow," Two hours of entertainment but one hour too short
","Blow is about a drugdealer. It is not about science, art or literature. Blow does not condemn the drugdealer. If you are a moralist that demands that drugdealing is condemned or you are a snob that demands advanced symbolism and deep meaning you should avoid Blow. It is `only' entertainment. It is for us who likes too see the building of criminal empires. Even though Blow is two hours I felt that it would have gained if it was one hour longer. I would have liked to see some of the deleted scenes that were on the DVD included in the movie (especially the courtroom revenge). Depp (as the drug dealer George Jung) is very good as always. (If you like to see him in a very exciting movie, see Nick of Time.) Ray Liotta makes a good and touching performance (as his father) and Cliff Curtis is amazing as Pablo Escobar, I would have liked a lot more scenes with him.The pacing is fast and it never gets boring. My only complaints are that Depp's visit to his former friend's island was so stupid and it is unbelievable that he did not get a bullet in the head right there, also I would have liked a less lighthearted story (without Paul Reubens feminine gay character) with more violence. 8/10",7,0,0,14 October 2001
Bruce Almighty," A masterpiece that will become a classic.
","In my opinion Dumb and Dumber is Jim Carrey's funniest movie but Bruce Almighty is his best.BA is not a pure comedy like Dumb and Dumber, one that only works because of the comedic genius of Carrey (together with a brilliant Jeff Daniels).BA has quite a few typical Carrey scenes that indeed are very funny, but BA is more than the sum of those scenes, it is brilliantly acted, masterfully directed and the story is very clever too.BA is a feel good movie in the tradition of Stewart/Capra, enhanced by the comedy genius Carrey in top form. It is very good to see Carrey back in the comedy genre, even though his more dramatic movies has been very good (Truman Show) or good but easily forgotten (the rest). Comedy is what Carrey does best and he does it like no other.The casting of Morgan Freeman was perfect. He is always good, but here he is perfect. The only pity is that he will never get a Greater role :) . Jennifer Aniston was also good and it is irrelevant that she has an easy role.My rating is 10, according to the IMDb rating scale of course.Finally some remarks to other reviewers: If there is a God I'm sure He/ She/the Neutrum is mighty enough to take on whatever form or color God wants, no matter descriptions of God in the Bible. In front of Bruce God may have found it best to look like Morgan Freeman, in front of you God may want to look like a pink elephant. Who knows? The answer is not in the movie. The purpose of BA is not to answer teological questions or support one religious belief in front of another. (BA is based on the monoteistic belief, but that is hardly the purpose of the movie). The message of the movie is not, like at least one reviewer stated, the conservative thought that we should be content with our place (other than being content we are not gods). If you have to try to find messages in a comedy movie I think they will be more like this in BA: You do not have to be content with your place, but don't expect God to fix everything for you (a more radical thought, maybe BA is unsuitable material for you americans) and there might be other things than your position that are more important. But the movie is not about sending out messages, it's purpose is to entertain and it is a success.If you are looking for symbolism, messages and such you may be better off watching another kind of movie. If you don't like Carrey, Seagal or Eastwood why do you watch their movies? Does not seem very intelligent to me.",10,1,3,11 August 2003
Signs," Very suspenseful, actually rather scary, always interesting and never boring
","There are always people out there complaining about faults in good and entertaining movies, faults that they are so clever to pinpoint. Do not listen to them.Signs is actually almost a horror masterpiece. I'm not a Mel Gibson fanatic. For instance, I hated The Patriot with Gibson and I thought Shyamalan's previous movie Unbreakable was rather bad. On the other hand I loved The Sixth Sense from the same director. If you agree with me on those I'm sure you will agree that Signs is very good.Signs has many strong points, The story is captivating from the beginning, the pacing is high and there is not a boring moment in the entire movie. The acting is also very good. Last but not least: Signs is actually a scary movie and that is not very common.The weak points are few and minor: The unneccessary comic relief with the aluminium foil protection, the boy's a little to clever lines and perhaps a little too much sentimentality.Rating 9/10. According to the IMDb rating system of course.Finally a few words to all you fault-finders and joykillers out there:SPOILER WARNINGYou think you are so clever. But with sarcastic summarys like 'They forgot their raincoates' and remarks about the effect of water you show that you are actually not very clever at all, not understanding that you are giving away important parts of the plot and thus ruining the movie experience for others.One reviwer for instance makes a big deal out of the fact that it is not likely that aliens, who are intelligent enough to travel to earth, would need crop signs as guidance. Of course not. Our cities are not hard to find, glowing like giant lightbulbs, sending out lots of heat and signals etc. And of course the aliens would have some coordinate system to find their way without crop signs. But how do you know the purpose of the crop signs? I don't know. All I know is that I heard a theory in the movie that it was for coordination. But did an alien explain the purpose of the crop signs? No, thought not. Maybe you are not that clever after all? Maybe the real purpose of the crop signs have to do with the aliens culture, maybe it is their warpaintings? Or maybe it is psychological warfare? Who knows?The same reviewer thought the ending was far fetched. But like Gibson said in the movie; there are two types of people. You are free to believe the ending was an act of god or that it was coincidence and only act of man. I thought the ending was very clever and I'm sure it is a lot more clever than something you can come up with.Last: Is it so hard to think that an alien species who has never had any contact with water could be surprised of the effect of water on themselves?",Null,0,2,19 July 2003
