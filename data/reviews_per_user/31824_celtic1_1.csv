Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Can't wait to see it again!
","After having waited 22 years (I saw Star Wars in 1977 on a date when I was 16), I was not disappointed in the least.  Granted, there were a few bits that weren't George Lucas at his best; however, I was enthralled by the effects and the overall storyline.  Now it's only a matter of patiently waiting it out for the next installment...But a few more trips to the Phantom Menace may appease my desire...for the moment.",9,5,7,20 May 1999
