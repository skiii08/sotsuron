Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Am I the Only One Who Thought it Was a Waste Time (and $)
","With so many accolades everywhere for this movie, I feel like the body snatchers have taken over the minds of all my fellow earthlings.It just wasn't that funny! I suppose there are lots of prudish folks in this west coast, middle class community. But they weren't the ones NOT doing the laughing at my screening. Mostly folks like me looking for a reason to laugh, and being forced to do so out of embarrassment.If confronting intolerance, be it racial, gender, sexual orientation etc. was the point of the this film, it could have been done more ... effectively (and intelligently). It may not offend you but it will certainly make you feel uncomfortable if there is an empathetic bone in your body.",1,53,104,27 November 2006
