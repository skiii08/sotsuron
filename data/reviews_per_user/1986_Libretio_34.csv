The Rock," Slick, sleek, brainless and bold
","THE ROCK Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalA grizzled convict (Sean Connery) - the only man who ever escaped from Alcatraz - is chosen to spearhead a military operation against a disaffected Marine general (Ed Harris) who has seized the former island-prison with a group of like-minded soldiers and is threatening to destroy San Francisco with a series of chemical weapons if the US government fails to restore benefits to the families of undercover operatives killed in the line of duty.The last of the collaborations between über-producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson (the latter died during production) and the second film in an ongoing partnership between Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (the first was BAD BOYS in 1995), whose 'style' emerged fully-formed under the producer's expert tutelage and corresponded entirely with the older man's cinematic ethos: Make it big, fast and furious, and when in doubt, blow something up! David Weisberg's screenplay (co-written with Douglas Cook and Mark Rosner) rings the changes on an old formula by giving the chief 'villain' an altruistic reason for his behaviour, which renders proceedings all the more compelling when Connery's team (including Michael Biehn, William Forsythe and Danny Nucci) arrives to throw a spanner in the works. Nicolas Cage plays an unlikely biochemist employed by Connery to help defuse the missiles, and whose lack of combat experience leaves him at the mercy of Harris' increasingly volatile subordinates (David Morse, Bokeem Woodbine and a clearly psychotic Tony Todd), though Cage's terrified Everyman character quickly learns how to kick butt with the best of 'em. Slick, sleek, brainless and bold, the movie rarely pauses for breath throughout, and is hugely entertaining from start to finish. Bay and Bruckheimer consolidated this film's massive commercial success with a string of crowd-pleasing potboilers, including 'Armageddon' (1998), PEARL HARBOR (2001) and BAD BOYS II (2003).",5,3,6,31 January 2005
Training Day," Cynical crime drama
","TRAINING DAY Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (J-D-C Scope)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSA rookie police officer (Ethan Hawke) joins an elite undercover drugs squad and is partnered with an older cop (Denzel Washington) who turns out to be just as corrupt and dangerous as any lowlife criminal.Antoine Fuqua's cynical crime drama features an award-winning performance by Denzel ('Gimme an Oscar') Washington as the crooked cop who believes in breaking the law to enforce the law ('To protect sheep, you gotta catch the wolf - and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf!'), and whose methods are tacitly approved by his bloated, cynical superiors. Clearly inspired by recent events within the LAPD, TRAINING DAY is told from Hawke's point of view, allowing the audience to share in his escalating sense of outrage, until he's finally tipped over the edge by a monstrous betrayal of trust. But, like any number of exploitation movies before it (even those as polished and presentable as this one), TRAINING DAY is conservative in thought and deed: Washington is sexy, dynamic and evil to the bone, and the movie wallows in his decadence before concluding with an audience-pleasing showdown between Good and Evil. The movie is dramatic and watchable, but it's also trite and superficial, and it leaves a bitter aftertaste.",4,5,18,31 December 2004
Se7en," Dark, uncompromising Hollywood shocker
","SE7EN Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDSOn the eve of retirement, a world-weary cop (Morgan Freeman) teams up with his younger replacement (Brad Pitt) in the hunt for a monstrous serial killer whose crimes are based on the seven deadly sins.Dark, gruesome shocker, with Freeman as a burnt-out cop struggling to make sense of the horrors he has witnessed during his long career, and Pitt as a headstrong character whose flaws lead to a devastating climactic 'twist'. The drama unfolds in an unnamed city where goodness and mercy have surrendered to human apathy, allowing a killer to fester unnoticed, until his monstrous scheme overwhelms the central characters. Andrew Kevin Walker's ingenious script works both as a police procedural and as an examination of society's moral vacuum, though the downbeat ending may strike some as too neat and cynical for its own good. The movie is quite shocking in places - the killing derived from the sin of 'lust' is particularly degrading - though it's also quite playful in its own twisted fashion (note, for instance, how the constant rainfall surrenders to bright sunlight for the horrific finale), and Darius Khondji's elegant widescreen cinematography belies the movie's grim subject matter. A triumph for director David Fincher (following the misguided ALIEN³), this is as close as 1990's Hollywood ever came to a 'daring' mainstream blockbuster, and nervous viewers are urged to avoid at all costs.",7,1,2,15 May 2005
Unbreakable," Unique take on the 'superhero' mythos
","UNBREAKABLE Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS-ES / SDDSAfter surviving a horrific train crash in which every other passenger died, an unassuming security guard (Bruce Willis) is contacted by a man with a rare bone disease (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes Willis is gifted with superhuman powers, like a character from a comic book...Hoping for lightning to strike twice after the unexpected commercial success of his determinedly uncommercial breakout feature THE SIXTH SENSE (1999), M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed this stylistically similar movie, setting a pattern that might well define his entire career. With its measured pace and gradual accumulation of narrative details, UNBREAKABLE posits Willis as an ordinary man whose life is transformed by an experience which opens his eyes to a whole new way of thinking, courtesy of Jackson's guru-like figure, a broken man who views Willis as his exact opposite, a literal superhero, though quite unlike the 'comic book' supermen which Jackson covets so much (he runs an art gallery dedicated to the work of great comic book artists). In fact, Willis and Jackson are the whole show here, and they both command attention in very different roles, playing characters who inspire change in one another, for better AND worse. However, Willis' first act as a bona fide 'superhero' - a compelling sequence in which he confronts a very modern 'supervillain', far removed from the juvenilia of most comic book baddies - reveals the dark side of his newfound powers, which are as much a curse as a blessing. The director even manages a genuinely traumatic 'twist' - less predictable than the one in THE SIXTH SENSE - which has a devastating effect on the major players. With Willis' career in the doldrums at the time of the film's release, UNBREAKABLE didn't have quite the same cultural impact as Shyamalan's previous effort, but it works a similar kind of visual magic. Not for all tastes, though its rewards are legion.",5,0,2,22 January 2005
Underworld," HELLRAISER meets THE MATRIX by way of THE HOWLING
","UNDERWORLD Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS-8The ongoing conflict between vampires and werewolves reaches its zenith following the discovery of an unwitting human (Scott Speedman) whose bloodline could prompt the genesis of a vampire-werewolf hybrid...Len Wiseman's grandiose offering has plenty of flash-bang-wallop but not much sparkle, and Danny McBride's disappointing script buries an imaginative premise beneath the dictates of a 'blockbuster' mentality. The film's big selling point is lead vampire Kate Beckinsale (PEARL HARBOR), clad in form-fitting leather trenchcoat (no slobbering at the back there!), who holds her own against an army of monstrous adversaries. Most of the supporting characters are played in broad strokes by an otherwise talented cast, including Michael Sheen (BRIGHT YOUNG THINGS) as the werewolf leader who struggles to contain the aggressive tendencies of his bloodthirsty minions, Sophia Myles (Lady Penelope in 2004's THUNDERBIRDS) as the ambitious young beauty who struggles to emerge from Beckinsale's shadow, and sexy Shane Brolly (DEADLY SWARM) as a misguided vampire who forms a clandestine alliance with the werewolves, leading to all manner of complications. However, industry veteran Bill Nighy steals the show as a vampire-lord woken from his centuries-long slumber by Beckinsale, precipitating a violent escalation in the conflict.The soap opera plot gets lost amid a string of ostentatious set-pieces, most of which involve vampires and werewolves pursuing each other through a Euro-Gothic landscape (Bruton Jones' superlative set designs are the film's trump card) and firing endless rounds of ammunition at one another, a scenario repeated (with minor variations) throughout the course of the film. It isn't frightening, or even remotely profound, merely noisy and excessive, which is par for the course these days. Production values are top-notch throughout, though the full-body werewolf suits (designed by GODZILLA's Patrick Tatopoulos) are a little too rubbery-looking, and the transformations from human to lycanthrope - though impressive - are clearly computer-generated, which rather spoils the effect. A sequel is currently in the works.NB. Though credited as 'Digitalscope' in the closing titles, the movie was actually photographed in 3-perf Super 35 and subsequently transferred to high-definition video, where it was completed in the digital domain before being reprinted to 35mm for theatrical release. Sadly, Wiseman and cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts don't make much use of the 2.39:1 frame, so the technology is largely wasted.",4,0,2,25 February 2005
Alien: Resurrection," A popcorn triumph
","ALIEN RESURRECTION Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS200 years after events in ALIEN³ (1992), a clone of Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is created by scientists on board an intergalactic research vessel where she's forced to incubate a new generation of aliens. Naturally, they escape...Against all the odds, ALIEN RESURRECTION is a popcorn triumph. The quirky humour evident in previous works by Gallic director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (DELICATESSEN, THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, etc.) has been replaced by an American sensibility - Ripley's clone is much stronger than her 'regular' counterpart, which allows her to physically dominate an otherwise imposing cast of strong alpha males - but the film retains the director's unique visual sense (evident in the fantastic spaceship designs and muted colour scheme), and Joss Whedon's pacy script acknowledges previous entries in this particular franchise whilst adding its own distinctive layers to the mythos. As might be expected, the alien threat has been upgraded and expanded from previous entries, culminating in the emergence of a truly nightmarish (though oddly pathetic) creature during an extended climax which reworks a similar scenario from the original ALIEN (1979) before closing on a uniquely gruesome image of death and horror.Winona Ryder takes second billing as a secretive young woman on a mission to prevent the aliens from making their way to Earth, while Michael Wincott (THE CROW), Ron Perlman (THE NAME OF THE ROSE) and beefcake Gary Dourdan (TV's 'C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation') provide excellent support as members of a pirate ship which docks at Ripley's research vessel shortly before chaos descends. Brad Dourif steals the show as a scientist with a hidden agenda (he shares a priceless 'personal' moment with one of the captive aliens when they pause to contemplate one another through a glass partition, one of the best scenes in the entire movie), and Jeunet regular Dominique Pinon makes his Hollywood debut as a disabled member of Wincott's crew whose wheelchair proves a hindrance during their headlong flight from the alien beasties. Mean, moody, but only slightly magnificent, the movie is sleek, engaging and fun. Followed by 'Abbott and Costello Meet the Alien'... er, I mean, AVP: ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (2004).",4,0,1,3 February 2005
Beauty and the Beast," A genuine, bona fide animation masterpiece
","BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo(35mm and 70mm release prints)An unfulfilled country girl (voiced by Broadway star Paige O'Hara) falls in love with the owner of an enchanted castle (Robby Benson), a handsome prince transformed by witchcraft into a monstrous Beast...Produced in the wake of Disney's smash-hit THE LITTLE MERMAID (1989) and helmed by debut animation directors Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST combines animated spectacle with vivid characterizations and exuberant musical numbers in a confection which ranks alongside the very finest 'golden age' Disney classics. Returning to the European folk tales which inspired many of their earlier animated features (SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, PINOCCHIO, etc.), scenarist Linda Woolverton leavens the essential romantic core of the film with exciting set-pieces and well-judged comic relief, and there are several stand-out sequences, designed and executed with breathtaking flair: A terrifying battle between the Beast and a pack of wolves; the spectacular and life-affirming 'Be Our Guest' number (voiced with remarkable dexterity by Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury); and the climactic assault on the castle, all of which are guaranteed to impress audiences young and old. The film - which is dedicated to the memory of co-songwriter Howard Ashman, who died before the film premiered in 1991 - was subsequently adapted to great acclaim for the Broadway stage, only to be sullied by an unnecessary TV series and a number of direct-to-video sequels. Stick with the original.NB. A re-edited version was released to Imax theaters in 2001, restoring a musical number dropped from the original assembly.",9,2,2,4 June 2005
The Others," Old-fashioned ghost story, rich with irony
","THE OTHERS (Los Otros) Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS1945: While awaiting her husband's return from the war, a lonely young woman (Nicole Kidman) locks herself into their remote, fog-bound mansion to protect their children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) from a condition which renders them ultra-sensitive to natural light. But a number of strange occurrences lead her to believe the house may be haunted...Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, THE OTHERS marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenábar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as THESIS (1996) and OPEN YOUR EYES (1997). Amenábar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.Like THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) before it, THE OTHERS prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amenábar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed). Beautiful, atmospheric sets by Benjamín Fernández, photographed with exquisite grace by Javier Aguirresarobe.(English version)",6,1,2,13 January 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Smoke and mirrors, all flash and no substance
","THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSUtterly routine blockbuster, loosely based on scientific predictions of disastrous climate changes due to global warming, in which the Gulf Stream is essentially 'shut off', triggering a series of freak weather conditions (giant hailstones in Japan, tornadoes in Los Angeles, tidal waves in New York, etc.) which culminate in a new Ice Age. Dennis Quaid is the obsessive climatologist who struggles to convince sceptical authorities of the impending catastrophe, and who is forced to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal) after the boy becomes stranded in Manhattan following torrential floods and the subsequent Big Freeze. Industrial Light & Magic unleashes a wealth of attention-grabbing visual effects during the film's impressive opening stretch, effectively sidelining the crudely drawn characters and half-baked melodramatics, but the superficial script (by Jeffrey Nachmanoff and director Roland Emmerich) fails to sustain the initial momentum, and the second half becomes bogged down in Quaid's ho-hum rescue mission. To be fair, the movie DOES contain a number of awe-inspiring sequences (the massive wave which rises from the ocean to engulf New York; the view from space as three colossal storms circle the entire northern hemisphere of the earth; a trawler floating serenely down a flooded Fifth Avenue), and a couple of satirical jabs are surprisingly potent (most notably, the mass exodus of American citizens INTO Mexico!), but the movie amounts to little more than smoke and mirrors, all flash and no substance.",4,96,195,3 January 2005
X-Men," Surprise! A blockbuster with brains, beauty, heart and soul...
","X-MEN Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSAgainst a backdrop of social exclusion and intolerance, a new breed of superhuman 'mutants' - ordinary people with extraordinary powers - are forced into a confrontation with supervillain Magneto (Ian McKellen), who plans to launch a devastating assault on the world's non-mutant population.Bryan Singer's magnificent film (based on the Marvel comic book) transcends genre expectations without skimping on the spectacle and melodrama inherent in modern blockbusters. David Hayter's clever script provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, and Singer is able to convey a wealth of information at high speed without obscuring the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.).The performances, too, are uniformly excellent: Stewart and McKellen are unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors add real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team (including Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden) look suitably spectacular, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen. Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Hugh Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of the film's rushed production schedule: Newton Thomas Sigel's scope photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins.While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia: Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protesters gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? This interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it provides plenty of food for thought. Followed by X2 (2003).",7,0,0,1 May 2005
Romeo + Juliet," Radical, but perhaps not radical enough?
","WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO & JULIET Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWith its contemporary setting and rough, insistent visuals, Baz Luhrmann's reinterpretation of 'Romeo and Juliet' adds a very 90s spin to the Bard's tale, targeting the youth market (notoriously disenchanted with the works of Shakespeare) with an aggressive, in-yer-face style. As such, the film is hip and sexy, and Old Bill's yarn has much to offer, but while Claire Danes' Juliet is the very picture of grace and innocence, Leonardo di Caprio - undoubtedly a fine young actor - seems out of place as Romeo, and he's upstaged in the good looks department by Paul Rudd as Paris. There's a show-stopping dance number (part of a drug-induced hallucination) at the masked ball where the two lovers first meet, and the second half of the film is powered by a raw emotional intensity, but a truly radical revision of the play might have involved the scrapping of Shakespeare's text altogether and the substitution of 90s dialogue to match the visuals.",5,4,7,28 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fine opening to ambitious fantasy trilogy
","THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS-ES / SDDSSomewhere in Middle Earth, an unassuming hobbit (Elijah Wood) comes into possession of a powerful ring coveted by evil forces throughout the land, and he embarks on a quest with elves, humans and fellow hobbits to destroy the ring once and for all.The first in a trilogy of fantasy films based on J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novels, helmed by the unlikely figure of Peter Jackson (previously responsible for splatterfests like BAD TASTE and BRAINDEAD). Despite a three hour running time, the film is invigorated by strong production values, excellent performances (especially Ian McKellen as a helpful wizard, Viggo Mortensen as a brave mortal who joins forces with his otherworldly brethren, and Wood as the hapless hobbit entrusted with a sacred mission) and a breakneck pace which remains faithful to the spirit of Tolkien's endeavors. The computer generated castles and landscapes are breathtaking in places, but Jackson is forced to overplay his hand in this respect, and the trickery loses some of its impact after a while, but there's no denying the craftsmanship and dedication of the production team. Christopher Lee plays the central villain with frightening gravitas, and there's a wealth of fine supporting players, including Liv Tyler, Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, amongst many others. An extended version of the film has since appeared on home video. Followed by THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS (2002).",6,0,0,3 May 2005
Van Helsing," A tribute to CGI effects, but not much else
","VAN HELSING Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS(Color & black and white)Under orders from a secret Vatican organization, monster-hunter Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) pursues Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) to his Transylvanian lair, where Jackman uncovers a fiendish plot to harness the electrical energy of Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to revive thousands of the vampire's dormant offspring.Having already plundered cinematic history for his recent monster outings (THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS), writer-director Stephen Sommers reassembled the remaining members of Universal's 'golden age' creatures for this bloated concoction, in which a bare-bones narrative is virtually swamped by an over-reliance on CGI effects. It certainly LOOKS spectacular: Allen Daviau's restless camera swoops and dives around Gothic sets which stretch into infinity, while nightmarish computer-generated creatures swirl across the screen with gravity-defying abandon, accompanied by a ceaseless blast of multichannel digital sound. Sommers is clearly respectful of his source material, but his best efforts are compromised by poor scriptwork, unlike Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' series (for example), which marries similar visual techniques to a strong plot line with subversive thematic undercurrents.There are two stand-out set-pieces: Dracula's brides (transformed into flying harpies) pursuing Jackman's carriage through a fog-bound forest along the edge of a yawning chasm; and the climactic duel between two Harryhausen-style monsters in the heart of Dracula's castle. Even better, Sommers breaks new ground in the depiction of CGI werewolves, portrayed here as ferocious, super-charged killing machines in some of the film's most frightening sequences (parents of young children take note). Jackman is as personable as ever, though he's barely stretched by the material, and he's given able support by gorgeous Kate Beckinsale (much better here than in the similarly-styled UNDERWORLD) as the native Transylvanian whose family has been decimated by Dracula's unwanted attentions, David Wenham as Van Helsing's travelling companion, and Hensley (buried under Greg Cannom's vivid makeup design) as Frankenstein's creation. Roxburgh's performance as Dracula alternates between camp affectation and genuine malevolence, and he's upstaged by Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran as his ultra-sexy vampire brides. Dancer-turned-actor Will Kemp plays Beckinsale's handsome werewolf brother, and there's a welcome cameo by Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid in the 'Harry Potter' series) as the monstrous Mr. Hyde.All in all, VAN HELSING represents a step forward in terms of visual effects technology, but doesn't amount to very much as a movie. In trying hard to please everyone, it ends up being too much and not enough, and it adds virtually nothing to the mythos it seeks to celebrate.",4,0,1,27 February 2005
Face_Off," Woo's US breakthrough: A triumph!
","FACE/OFF Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSThis magnificent thriller represents director John Woo's triumphant return to the kind of hyperkinetic, emotionally charged film-making which made him such a hot property in the first place. Following the artistic bankruptcy of his first two Hollywood projects, this one is a marriage of high-octane movie-making and mind-twisting narrative complexities. It's also one of the few American action movies which manages to strike a balance between crowd-pleasing set-pieces and domestic interludes, and renders them equally important. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are perfectly matched as hero/villain (and vice versa!), whilst heavyweight theatre actress Joan Allen provides the narrative with much of its dramatic backbone in the role of Travolta's wife (the scene in which she is first confronted with her husband in Cage's body is almost identical to a similar scene in Terence Fisher's FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED [1969]). Technically, the film is a blast, and Woo stages the action highlights with a visual grace and dexterity that is often breathtaking to behold. The climactic speedboat battle is probably the finest set-piece of Woo's career to date, and the script is overflowing with visual and thematic ironies that underscore the action highlights. In fact, the production has arguably more dramatic resonance than any other Hollywood blockbuster of the 1990s, but the dictates of American commercialism mean that Woo is only able to skate over the emotional surface of his characters and their moral dilemmas. The two main protagonists are much too cold and heartless to fully engage the audience's sympathies, and there's nothing here that matches the scorching human drama of, say, BULLET IN THE HEAD (1990). But for all that, FACE/OFF dares to go deeper than your average Hollywood action picture. It's clever, witty and thrilling, and it manages to accomplish the difficult task of feeding the brain whilst entertaining the eye.",8,91,141,26 January 2000
American History X," Evils of racism exposed by scorching drama
","'American History X'Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS(Color & black and white)An angry young white supremacist (Edward Norton) is reformed whilst in prison for killing two black men, and struggles to prevent his younger brother (Edward Furlong) from travelling down the same desperate path.Scorching drama, elevated by Norton's intense performance as the frustrated rebel whose intelligence is twisted by circumstances into an all-consuming hatred of minorities, until his eyes are finally opened to the realities of such manufactured racism. Commercials/music video director Tony Kaye made his feature debut here, though the project was taken out of his hands by studio bosses and 'completed' by Norton following a lengthy editing process, prompting Kaye to reject the finished product (he was refused permission to credit himself as 'Humpty Dumpty'). David McKenna's script describes the ways in which Nazi ideology is propagated by strong-minded individuals who impose their influence on the young and vulnerable (Stacy Keach plays the head of Norton's local skinhead chapter, who co-ordinates episodes of violent 'activism' from a safe legal distance), and how it manifests itself amongst those without an appropriate outlet for their aggressive tendencies.The film kicks into high gear from the outset, when the full extent of Norton's racism becomes apparent during a horrific confrontation with his widowed mom's new boyfriend (Elliott Gould), followed by a gut-wrenching scene in which Norton commits the sickening crime that will send him to prison and change his life forever. There, his worldview is profoundly challenged not only by his friendship with African-American co-worker Guy Torry (terrific in a pivotal role), but also by the double standards employed amongst the skinhead gangs he encounters within the prison system. For these characters, there can be no happy ending, and the film builds to a shattering finale. Also starring Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, William Russ and an unrecognizable Fairuza Balk. Fine technical credits.",6,1,3,12 February 2005
Pearl Harbor," Romantic, flamboyant and defiantly old-fashioned
","PEARL HARBOR Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS-8(35mm and 70mm release prints)On the eve of America's entry into World War II, two young fighter pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) - friends since childhood - are driven apart by their love for a beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale), but they're forced to set aside their differences when Japanese forces attack the US naval base at Pearl Harbor...One of the most expensive - and vilified - films of its day, this gargantuan epic stands accused of exploiting historical tragedy for commercial gain, courtesy of producer Jerry Bruckheimer (notorious for a string of opportunistic blockbusters) and director Michael Bay (previously responsible for such unassuming action fare as 'The Rock' and 'Armageddon'). This argument may - or may not - have merit, but as a *movie*, PEARL HARBOR is romantic, flamboyant and defiantly old-fashioned, like a 1940's picture postcard come to life. And as a spectacle, it's hard to beat: The attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the most breathtaking set-pieces in Hollywood history, offering a pilot's-eye view of the aerial bombardment, the destruction on the ground, and the horrendous loss of life. It may seem exploitative to some viewers, but Bay uses modern technology (including a terrific multichannel soundtrack) to capture the drama, heartbreak and horror of the occasion like never before.Randall Wallace's overheated script is a little too jingoistic in places (co-star Alec Baldwin is much given to speechifying in this regard), but the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett is depicted with great tenderness and affection, and while their dispute over Beckinsale is probably the least engaging aspect of the entire production, the pay-off still packs quite an emotional wallop. The supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Mako and Dan Aykroyd, with Jon Voight as President Roosevelt (his speech to Congress on 8 December 1941 remains as powerful today as it ever was). Try to see the R-rated director's cut, which offers a slightly more graphic - and therefore more honest - depiction of the death and destruction inflicted on American servicemen (and women) during the Pearl Harbor disaster.",6,1,5,7 January 2005

Anderson) marks time between set-pieces, and barely makes an impression. Despite a top-line cast (including Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes) and excellent production values, Anderson's movie replicates the computer game's limitless excess, and reduces its characters to the status of zombie fodder, despite a handful of plot twists which set the dwindling survivors against one another as the zombie hordes descend from all sides.

Far removed from the extravagant Vietnam-operas favored by Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone, Schumacher's film examines the contradictions of war and the dehumanizing effect of combat on ordinary men through the experiences of Farrell's anti-hero, a compassionate man who despises the self-serving patriotic nonsense peddled by his superiors, and who refuses to compromise his own ideals, despite the sometimes painful repercussions of his disobedience.Though backed by a major studio, TIGERLAND has the look and feel of a low-budget indie production, using hand-held camera-work and grainy film-stock for documentary effect, and this uncompromising 'Dogme'-like approach allows Schumacher to focus his attention on the characters and their situation rather than the pyrotechnics which usually dominate such movies. Farrell may be the star of the show, but he's matched by debut actor Matthew Davis (BLOODRAYNE) as his closest friend and fellow combatant, an aspiring writer who volunteered for duty and who favors intellect and reason over Farrell's reckless bravado. Fine supporting cast, excellent technical credits.",6,27,35,31 January 2005
28 Days Later...," High-concept horror has its faults and virtues
","28 DAYS LATER...Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalSurvivors of a virus which turns infected victims into murderous zombie-like creatures struggle to stay alive amidst the chaos.High-concept horror from TRAINSPOTTING director Danny Boyle and novelist-cum-screenwriter Alex Garland (THE BEACH), produced on a modest budget and filmed with digital video cameras (transferred to 35mm for theatrical exhibition). Cillian Murphy is the hapless hero, compelled to join forces with a motley band of survivors (including Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Noah Huntley) who run afoul of an Army encampment run by well-meaning - but deluded - military officer Christopher Eccleston, whose rash behavior unleashes a fresh wave of horror. Comparisons with the work of George A. Romero are inevitable, though the film's impact is blunted by rapid editing which curtails the violence and renders some of the action scenes incomprehensible in places. However, Boyle uses edgy visuals to keep the audience off-guard at all times, and the narrative builds to a satisfying conclusion. The opening sequence, in which Murphy stumbles through deserted London streets, is truly haunting.",5,5,8,29 April 2005
Amadeus," Music and melodrama - a classic combination
","AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby DigitalMany years after the death of Mozart (Tom Hulce), the aged and embittered court composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) relates to a disbelieving priest the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical genius and how it led to jealousy, betrayal, and possibly even murder...Sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script. Based on his well-received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) - and its updated version, reviewed here as AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, released in 2001 - portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle-lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys. The composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions. But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar-winning turn as Mozart's nemesis Salieri, consumed by envy and hatred whilst simultaneously awed by his rival's genius, the genius which Salieri had wished for himself, only to be denied by a mischievous God. The scenes in his asylum cell - where the elder Salieri confesses his 'crime' to a naive priest (Richard Frank) - are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen. Beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by unexpected tragedy. A masterpiece.The director's cut runs 180 minutes (the original theatrical version ran 160m) and reinstates various bits and pieces which help to clarify a number of crucial plot developments (the antagonism between Salieri and Mozart's wife is more fully explained, for example). Incredibly, the MPAA gave the film an R-rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera! There's nothing here which warrants anything more than a PG-13.NB. The original version was released theatrically in 35mm and 70mm editions, featuring a 6-track Dolby Stereo soundtrack.",10,6,10,31 May 2005
Rules of Engagement," Watchable drama takes the easy route to nowhere
","RULES OF ENGAGEMENT Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSFollowing a horrific incident outside the US embassy in Yemen, during which US marines opened fire on a crowd of 'innocent' civilians, killing 83 of them, a former Army lawyer (Tommy Lee Jones) emerges from retirement to defend the colonel (Samuel L. Jackson) blamed for the massacre.OK courtroom drama, directed with routine proficiency by former Hollywood wunderkind William Friedkin. Stephen Gaghan's script stacks the odds against Jones and Jackson from the outset, though the happy ending is something of a foregone conclusion. There's a few silly diversions along the way (including an ill-advised punch-up between Jones and Jackson at the midway point), but nothing too disastrous. Production values are solid, and the opening scenes depicting events at the US embassy in Yemen are genuinely potent, but the film paints everything in black and white and refuses to take risks with the material. A gaunt-looking Guy Pearce plays the lead prosecutor (ruthless, but humane), and Bruce Greenwood is the senatorial villain who would like to see Jackson buried for political reasons, but the starry supporting cast - including Ben Kingsley, Anne Archer, Blair Underwood and Philip Baker Hall - are largely wasted in virtual cameo roles.",4,0,1,14 February 2005
Casualties of War," Blistering assault on the degrading effects of warfare
","CASUALTIES OF WAR Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo(35mm and 70mm release prints)During a routine field trip at the height of the Vietnam War, a young soldier (Michael J. Fox) rebels against his commanding officer (Sean Penn) and other members of his patrol when they kidnap a defenceless Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le) and subject her to a terrifying physical ordeal.Unfairly overshadowed by the simultaneous theatrical release of Oliver Stone's pompous - but still impressive - BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (1989), Brian DePalma's CASUALTIES OF WAR recreates a harrowing incident from the Vietnam conflict - first reported in 'New Yorker' magazine in 1969 - in which a group of otherwise decent men succumbed to their own worst impulses and committed a terrible crime. Filmed with typical cinematic bravado by master craftsman DePalma, the movie uses every inch of the scope frame to convey both the duality of the landscape (vast swathes of breathtaking countryside, where sudden death lurks around every corner) and the moral vacuum which stretches the two central characters (Fox and Penn) to breaking point. Crafted with blistering simplicity by screenwriter David Rabe (himself a Vietnam veteran and author of the acclaimed stageplay 'Streamers'), the soldiers are depicted as brave individuals whose principles are shattered by their traumatic combat experiences, leaving Fox to essay the role of peacemaker in a world where all the rules have been turned upside down. Thuy - a model with no prior acting experience - is truly heartbreaking as the soldiers' terrified prisoner, and her ultimate fate is so horrific (arguably the most disturbing set-piece of this director's entire career), many viewers will be too appalled to see the film through to its inevitable conclusion. All in all, this uncompromising drama emerges as one of DePalma's strongest films to date.",7,31,40,5 May 2005

The Evil Dead," Gore galore, but not much more!!
","THE EVIL DEAD Aspect ratio: 1.37:1Sound format: MonoWhilst on vacation at an isolated backwoods cabin, five students are terrorized by ancient spirits which possess and kill them, one by one.Clearly the work of talented filmmakers going places, this OTT gore-fest is alternately loud, excessive, stylish and disgusting, in roughly equal amounts. Debut director Sam Raimi throws everything into the mix, perhaps to atone for a flimsy plot and stock characters (well-played by an excellent cast, including cult-performer-in-the-making Bruce Campbell), and while much of it is tongue-in-cheek, some scenes leapfrog the taste barrier with unconscionable glee (Raimi has since admitted the 'tree rape' sequence was a mistake, for example). Sadly, the movie is rendered monotonous by its excessive pace and comic insouciance (the sequels - beginning with EVIL DEAD II - went even further in this direction), and the movie quickly succumbs to the laws of diminishing returns; once you've seen one drooling demon getting its head cut off, you've seen 'em all! Fantastic low budget production values, however, and the makeup effects are dandy.NB. Caught up in the UK's 'video nasties' hysteria, the movie was cut and banned and generally unseen in that country until 2002, when it was finally passed uncut by the British censor. The complete version first aired on UK TV in 2005.",4,2,10,7 March 2005
The Big Blue," Magnificent, no matter which version you see
","THE BIG BLUE (Le Grand Bleu) Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Technovision)Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo SR(35mm and 70mm release prints)Two of the world's greatest free divers (Jean-Marc Barr and Jean Reno) are divided by their competitive spirit, and their professional rivalry is further complicated when Barr falls in love with a beautiful admirer (Rosanna Arquette).Luc Besson first expressed his love of the sea with this magical visual poem, in which the plot (Barr's struggle between physical reality and the spiritual lure of the sea) takes a back seat to the stunning widescreen visuals. The longer version - currently available on home video worldwide - simply extends the existing plot without adding anything new or significant to proceedings, and while some will find the extended print lumbering and awkward in places, others will relish the spiritual dimension invested in every frame. In fact, the only thing more beautiful than the scenery itself is Barr, who almost steals the show from bombastic Gallic superstar Reno. Almost, but not quite.The movie was photographed with anamorphic Technovision lenses, credited as 'CinemaScope' on-screen. Besson returned to the aquatic theme with ATLANTIS (1991), a non-narrative celebration of the ocean depths.(English version)",8,3,6,1 February 2005
Pulp Fiction," Interesting movie, but hardly a 'classic'
","PULP FICTION Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby Stereo SRGreat dialogue counts for much in Quentin Tarantino's highly acclaimed PULP FICTION, but the film suffers at times from a surfeit of unnecessary chatter. None of the main characters are particularly likable, but Tarantino's script is eventful and forthright, and he manages to juggle the disparate elements of humor and horror with consummate ease. Harvey Keitel steals the film in a cameo appearance that doesn't actually require him to *do* very much, but he does it beautifully anyway; Maria de Medeiros is sweetness itself in another cameo as Bruce Willis' girlfriend; and Samuel L. Jackson dominates the screen in a disturbing sequence where he and John Travolta confront some thieving young punks (led by Frank Whaley) in a run-down apartment. Best scene: a 'hilarious' gunshot decapitation and its grisly aftermath.",4,0,7,24 January 2000
Halloween," Overrated in some respects, but a fine movie nonetheless
","HALLOWEEN Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: MonoFifteen years after he was institutionalized as a child for murdering his sister, psychotic Michael Myers escapes from custody and returns to his home town on Halloween, where he stalks and kills a group of teenage babysitters.Dismissed by many critics on its original release as a routine quickie with few redeeming features, this low-budget shocker - director John Carpenter's follow-up to another cult favorite, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976) - established its reputation via word-of-mouth at a time when movies could sustain a prolonged release schedule, and it finally emerged as one of the most successful independent productions of the 1970's. Aided immeasurably by Dean Cundey's expansive scope photography - his autumnal color schemes and deep, deep shadows suggest a feature-length extension of the similarly-styled Halloween sequence in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944) - and an unforgettable music score (composed by the director himself), Carpenter's film is stronger on mood than narrative, and builds slowly - too slowly, for some - toward a climactic set-piece in which the killer pursues his final victim.Donald Pleasence toplines an impressive cast (in a role turned down by Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, amongst others!) as an obsessive doctor who arrives in small-town America to convince local authorities that 'boogeyman' Michael Myers is nothing less than Evil Incarnate, while second-billed Jamie Lee Curtis - a little too old to be playing a frightened high-schooler - acts up a storm as the vulnerable heroine targeted for destruction by an unstoppable killer; her climactic face-off with 'The Shape' is a technical tour de force. An exercise in relentless terror for some viewers, an overrated bore for others, HALLOWEEN has nevertheless withstood the test of time, and its influence on the modern horror genre is undeniable. Followed by HALLOWEEN II (1981) and a host of increasingly lackluster sequels, until the franchise was dusted off and revitalized for a whole new generation in Steve Miner's impressive entry, HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER (1998).",6,5,11,23 February 2005
Speed," A blockbuster classic - who'da thunk?!
","SPEED Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSA ruthless terrorist (Dennis Hopper) plants a bomb inside a bus which is primed to detonate if the vehicle's speed falls below 50mph, and a SWAT team is dispatched to guide it through rush hour traffic.That rarity in modern American cinema - a high concept bubblegum movie which doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. Episodic in structure, the movie pits Hopper's vengeful psychopath against SWAT member Keanu Reeves (whose career went into overdrive from this point onward), and barely pauses for breath along the way. Debut director (and erstwhile cinematographer) Jan de Bont transforms Graham Yost's modest screenplay into a super-charged thrill-machine, photographed (by Andrzej Bartkowiak) and edited (by John Wright) to perfection, and augmented by some of the best stuntwork and visual effects money can buy. The cast is a ragbag of new faces, old-timers and dependable character actors: Reeves and Hopper dominate the show, while leading lady Sandra Bullock 'makes cute' in a career-making performance, and there's strong support from Jeff Daniels (DUMB & DUMBER) and Joe Morton (THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET) in crucial secondary roles. Followed by SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL (1997).NB. A 'sleeper' hit by Hollywood blockbuster standards, the film owes a narrative debt to Junya Sato's Japanese thriller THE BULLET TRAIN (1975), in which a terrorist bomb is primed to explode on board a packed commuter train if it falls below a certain speed. It's possible SPEED was written and produced in complete ignorance of the earlier film, but no one connected with de Bont's version seems willing to address the similarities.",8,0,0,12 June 2005
X2: X-Men United," Hugely impressive sequel delivers the blockbuster goods
","X2 Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTSFollowing an attempt on the US President's life by what appears to be a rogue mutant (Alan Cumming), the school for 'gifted youngsters' established by Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is raided by military factions opposed to the integration of mutants into American society. The X-Men are subsequently forced into a collaboration with their mortal enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen) to clear their names and destroy an all-powerful threat from humankind...Opening with one of the most astonishing action set-pieces of recent years (underscored by the 'Dies Irae' from Mozart's 'Requiem'), and closing with an extended confrontation between Good and Evil that tops anything in the original X-MEN (2000), Bryan Singer's powerhouse sequel ups the ante in terms of spectacle and excitement, whilst simultaneously expanding and developing the radical subtext (a minority group forced to take a stand against prejudice) inherent in the original Marvel comic strip. Beautifully filmed, and performed with gusto by a dedicated cast (including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Brian Cox, relegating Patrick Stewart, James Marsden and Anna Paquin to secondary roles this time out), the narrative unfolds with bold precision, constantly surprising the audience with inventive visuals and heartfelt emotional drama (the mutant 'coming out' scene - played with knowing irony by young Shawn Ashmore - will resonate especially with gay viewers). Also, this is one of the few movies in recent years to use the Super 35 format in a defiantly cinematic manner, with none of the concessions to television which usually characterize this 'fake' widescreen process.

","THE SIXTH SENSE Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWhilst recovering from a recent trauma, a child psychologist (Bruce Willis) helps a little boy (Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see ghosts.Released the same year as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999), another 'spook' movie which divided audiences and reaped dividends at the international box-office, M. Night Shyamalan's breakout feature THE SIXTH SENSE plays much better on TV than it ever did in theaters. With its slow tempo and stately visuals, the movie takes a mature approach to its supernatural subject matter, revealing Osment's ultra-creepy 'secret' in piecemeal fashion, one scare at a time. Former tough guy Willis plays a vulnerable figure whose bond with Osment provides a level of stability absent from his personal life - devastated by an incident in the film's opening sequence, Willis' wife (Olivia Williams) seems to be drifting into a relationship with a young family friend (Glenn Fitzgerald) - and while Osment is the primary focus of Shyamalan's screenplay, it's Willis who holds the material together. Some viewers may be distracted by the film's deliberate pacing, while others will be affected by the gradual accumulation of creepy details, spiked by a couple of really good jolts. The much-lauded twist ending might have been more effective had it not been mentioned in EVERY SINGLE REVIEW (including this one!), making it possible for many people to guess the 'surprise' long before Shyamalan reveals his hand. Australian actress Toni Collette is superb as Osment's harried - but deeply loving - mom, and there are cameo appearances by Shyamalan himself and an unrecognisable Donnie Wahlberg (BAND OF BROTHERS).",5,2,3,22 January 2005

Strong B-list actors Bruce Greenwood and (especially) Steven Culp are superb as the Kennedy brothers, determined to find a political solution to the unfolding situation, despite unrest among their military advisers. David Self's script allows a few domestic interludes, to emphasize the effect of the disaster on ordinary lives, and Donaldson keeps things moving swiftly along, clarifying a wealth of details with economy and grace. All the key incidents are reproduced, including a nail-biting moment following the introduction of a US-sanctioned blockade of Cuba, when American warships prepare to fire on Russian tankers steaming toward the exclusion zone. How much of this is strictly accurate, and how much is emphasized for dramatic purposes can't be guessed, but THIRTEEN DAYS does a fine job of educating viewers unfamiliar with this momentous historical incident.",5,0,1,31 January 2005
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Romantic, melancholy and beautiful - a vampire epic for the new millennium
","INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDS17th century New Orleans: The relationship between an ancient vampire (Tom Cruise) and his bloodsucking protegé (Brad Pitt) is tested to destruction by a young girl (Kirsten Dunst) who challenges their established dynamic, leading to betrayal and murder.A doom-laden meditation on life and death and the nature of grief, based on Anne Rice's bestselling novel (written as a response to the death of her beloved daughter), and featuring two of contemporary Hollywood's most recognizable stars (both astonishingly beautiful here) as vampire and willing victim, remaining eternally young as the world evolves around them. Cruise plays a seasoned killer who revels in bloodthirsty excess, while Pitt is a conscientious objector who balks at the prospect of drinking human blood, until Cruise creates a 'companion' for Pitt in the shape of a little girl (Dunst) who refuses to grow old gracefully, with tragic consequences.Scored with melancholy grace by composer Elliot Goldenthal, and beautifully designed and photographed (by Dante Ferretti and Philippe Rousselot, respectively), the film is epic in concept and execution, spanning the social upheavals of 17th and 18th century America and the horrors of 19th century Europe, where a nest of ancient vampires (led by scene-stealer Antonio Banderas and a miscast Stephen Rea) wreak terrible revenge on those who transgress against vampire lore. But, for all its spectacle, director Neil Jordan (THE COMPANY OF WOLVES) - working from a script credited to Rice herself - maintains a leisurely pace and never loses sight of the characters. The movie contains some beautiful, transcendent passages, including a breathtaking transition from 19th century Europe to modern day America via the introduction of motion pictures (everything from SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS to GONE WITH THE WIND and SUPERMAN!), and an incredibly moving sequence in which a once-proud vampire is discovered in exile, laid low by his own vanity.The film's delicate tone is upset by a trick ending which comes completely out of left-field, though Jordan has denied any suggestion of studio interference. And, as with the novel, the homoerotic undercurrent is mere window-dressing, an unconsummated tease which the filmmakers (and Rice herself) refuse to explore in any detail, lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly, the movie is dedicated to the memory of River Phoenix - originally cast as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title - who died of a drugs overdose during pre-production; his role was taken by Christian Slater.
