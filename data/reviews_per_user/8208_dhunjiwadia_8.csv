Ford v Ferrari," Delivers on all fronts
","I'm not a great fan of car racing but director James Mangold's work delivers on all fronts for a thoroughly enjoyable cinematic experience. Besides, it's also a great human interest story. The entire cast performs well but the main 2 actors are ahead of the rest. As always, Christian Bale disappears himself into the character and gives an outstanding performance. Matt Damon gets to show quite a range from confident showman to a rarely seen vulnerability. Cinematography by Phedon Papamichael immerses the viewer into the racing action. The editing is outstanding and also the sound design is excellent - it makes your heart race faster as you hear the roar of the Ford GT 40. Some of the races are simulated by stuntmen. And some are created through computer graphics. But the real and computer graphics footage are indistinguishable because of the camera work and editing.
It's one of the most energetic and memorable films of the year. Mangold is an ace director.",8,1,2,7 February 2020
Knives Out," Star-studded old-stylr whodunnit with hilarious parts in many scenes.
",I guess Star Wars fans are still angry with director Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi. KnivesOut is like an Agatha Christie story but with American characters in modern day America. It's a star-studded old-style whodunnit with hilarious parts in many scenes. The movie will have mixed reviews as it's strictly for people who are looking for a nostalgic entertaining time.,7,1,2,7 February 2020
The Irishman," A final statement by the masters - returning for one last ride.
","Martin Scorsese will forever be known for his gangster movies. Because he combines drama, brotherhood, violence and humour to create a formula that continues to work even when he's 76 years old.
Leaving the door half open at the end explains everything - Jimmy would leave his bedroom door open because he trusted Frank. This door represents trust that must never be broken. (Don't worry, it's not a spoiler.)
Seems like the end of an era - Scorsese, De Niro, Pacino, Pesci - a final statement by the masters - returning for one last ride.",8,2,6,7 February 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable.
","It took Quentin Tarantino a lifetime of living, 5 years to write and a 2 hours 41 minutes watch. This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support.The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair.Will be quite a bit for those under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood. Some will categorise this as an over indulgent nostalgia trip for movie geeks. And they are likely to be correct. But for those of us who complain that Hollywood is reduced to remakes and comic book films, QT delivers a unique and creative viewing experience.",9,96,138,7 February 2020
1917," Immersively done, sucks you into the horror of World War one
","Immersively done, the movie sucks you into the horror of World War One. The camera tracks these 2 soldiers all the way through their mission with a smooth one shot for the entire length of the movie. According to the director Sam Mendes, it allows you to live with them and breathe every breath. And that feeling of never seeing further than the characters, always being trapped within their immediate environment, was an important reason why they decided to shoot this way. From the acting, to the cinematography, editing, score and overall direction Sam Mendes creates one of the best pieces of film ever to grace the silver screen. Congratulations in advance to 14 times Academy Awards nominee Roger Deakins for all the visual and technical brilliance - guaranteed Oscar for Best Cinematography. And for the critics who complain that there is no character building moment in the movie, it's because the motivation here is to save lives and not focus on characters. #1917 leaves you breathless, with an uplifting feeling (and some tears) when the journey comes to an end.
Only to be seen on the big screen, preferably IMAX 2D.",10,5,8,7 February 2020
Joker," The movie is about a character, not action or explosions.
","Someone had to step out of the safe game played by Superhero movies. This movie is about a character, not action or explosions. Joaquin Phoenix shows us what a joker is in our society and how power can be obtained. Todd Phillips on the other hand had the perfect choice of music, camera angles, lighting and every other important aspect of the film. The movie gave me instant 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' vibes, without copying both films. This movie will drag you into your deepest thoughts, in your darkest secrets and suffering.
Coming to the inevitable comparison of who's the better joker - Heath or Joaquin? The answer is - both did a phenomenal job. And Joker is fortunate to have being played by two phenomenal actors.
Finally, whether you like it or not, there's no denying you're going to be talking for a long, long time.",10,7,12,7 February 2020
Parasite," Just when you think you've seen it all, a movie comes along to shatter all your beliefs.
","Parasite is a true work of art and a rare and extraordinary masterpiece that should be viewed by all, especially film lovers. If you're planning to watch this movie avoid spoilers at all costs. It will have you conflicted on who you are rooting for. Parasite taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between the rich and poor around the world. It's a darkly, entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family and the rich Park family, their polar opposites. The film makes you play a guessing game on which of the two families are more rotten. Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. It's best to go into the movie not knowing too much about what you're about to see, and let it's sly power sneak up on you. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich that suck the marrow of the poor.",10,33,55,6 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Heart and love can prevail
","The story is proof of the adage 'Kill them with kindness' when what we really want to kill is hatred. Director Taika Waititi takes one of the most gruesome moments of human history and finds humour and beauty in narrating it. (I can only remember Mel Brooks doing something similar before with The Producers - in a completely different story though.) Surrounded by well known, seasoned actors (Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson), the two children - Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie - stand out. And Waititi in the role of the imaginary Hitler is hilarious. Be prepared to laugh out loud in one scene yet cry your heart out in the next.
It's a story that needs to be told over and over again because people easily turn a blind eye to the horrors of humankind, but heart and love can prevail.",8,1,4,7 February 2020
