Lucky Number Slevin," Excellent Twist
","I will have to say that Joshua Hartnett and Bruce Willis definitely have chemistry. Watched the movie-Wow, what a mind blower. Joshua really pulled off the part. Looked at some critics notes and they stated that Joshua was wearing a towel more then wearing clothes. Completely wrong!!!!Same critic who stated this, also stated 'Ghost' was a flop. Joshua Hartnett really showed great talent and compassion in this film. Bruce Willis has always been tremendous I believe, with every Part he's played. What a Mind blower, fabulous. Joshua, if you are reading this, I read a book ' A Rose In Winter' by Kathryn Woodiwiss. You would be fantastic for the lead role. Keep the movies rolling Joshua!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9,0,1,3 October 2006
