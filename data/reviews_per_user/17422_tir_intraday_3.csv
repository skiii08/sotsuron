Black Swan," A journey into a higher plane
","Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan' is among many things a tribute to balley, that fine art that does not touch the lives of most of us that comprise the hoi polloi, the common milieu, that revels and indulges in the mediocre and the mundane, and has steadily lost touch the finer aspects of civilization. And that's not all, of course not. It's also a journey into an artist's mind, a discovery of the dark side, not just for the protagonist, but for the audience too, into their own. Natalie Portman's Nina shall stay in the inner recesses of the mind for the rest of your life, as she not only discovers the cygnus atratus in her during the course of the film but almost gets the same release too.In the inevitable comparison with his other films, it pleases one to find a brilliant director adding to an already formidable oeuvre of movies like 'Pi', 'The Fountain', and the 'Wrestler'. 'Black Swan' is without doubt Aronofsky's finest till date. The technical aspects of the film are first-rate, the characterization absolutely apt, the editing tight, the cinematography brilliantly succeeding at the introspection of the dark side of one's character. The quality of the lighting and the sound forces one to get into the mood, and feel the character's pain, both and real and imagined. Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' is rendered in a beautiful manner, with the composition seamlessly melding into the background, rising and falling in a cadence, making for a heady and memorable experience. This is required viewing for every lover of grade-A cinema, and in doing so it forces one to think about the pedestrian nature of most oft the other movies released this year. That to my mind could be the only negative for the movie.",9,1,2,23 April 2011
The Ring," Satisfying horror.
","I saw 'The Ring' last night. It's been a long time since I saw something so utterly horrifying. I enjoyed the movie to the last minute. There are no demons or goblins, no gore, no loud, ear-splitting noises, and no aliens either. Yet this movie manages to rivet your attention, holds you spell-bound till you feel the chill in your veins.Any good horror movie should leave some of the details to be figured out by the viewers. This move does.I like horror movies, and this must rank all the way up there with 'The Exorcist'. The cinematography is excellent. The aerial views of Rachel's car speeding along the lonely road are breathtakingly beautiful. The whole movie has cyan tinge to it, and the images are haunting. The director has not spent much time on irrelevant details, and must be congratulated for it.
I'd give this movie an 8/10.",Null,0,0,25 January 2003
Warrior," Best Action movie of 2011, and something to be seen again and again
","Warrior is Gavin O' Connor's best movie to date, and certainly one of the best action movies of all times. Beyond the top-notch, and quite realistic action sequences, the movie--as the t-shirt of Brendan Conlon's trainer Frank shows--has the 'soul of a lion'. The backdrop of an MMA championship remains so, in the backdrop, with the key element of drama remaining the tension and struggles of a broken family, consisting of a ex-alcoholic war-veteran father, an elder son who teaches school Physics, and the younger son who suffers from PTSD from the war in Iraq.Forgiveness comes hard when the wounds are too deep, when the man to forgive was responsible for the premature and miserable death of your mother, and when the elder brother stood you up when you tried to run away from the abusive father. Tommy Conlon finds refuge in the marine corps, only to see his best buddy die from friendly fire. He goes AWOL, takes his mother's name, and surfaces back in the States. His father Paddy is the best trainer he's had, the main responsible for making him a child prodigy in wrestling, and despite the loathing, he knows that's the way to go if he's to get the money to support his dead buddy's family.Brendan Conlon the elder brother has always resented his father's preference for his younger brother, the better fighter. Now a schoolteacher, with a delayed and oppressive loan, he knows the three jobs between his wife and him are not sufficient to retain their house, and tries his hand at MMA, harking back to his past stint at the UFC, where his performance was nothing to write home about. He knows the prize money is the way out of a potential bankruptcy, and knows the choices are difficult, but limited.Paddy Conlon the war veteran has been off the bottle for a thousand days and seeks redemption in the church, and Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Try as he might to get closer to either son, the two sons have only thing in common as Tommy puts it sometime late in the movie--they both have absolutely no use for their ex-alcoholic wife-beating father. He tries nevertheless, taking abuse and ridicule in his stride, since he knows forgiveness is the only way out of his past sins. Nick Nolte's role is understated and so realistic it defies comprehension. For that matter, both the protagonists are so good I kept expecting to see either one of them being actual MMA fighters (having not recalled either of their earlier movies). The fights between them are realistic, and hold your attention without being tacky.The climax is sure-fire tear-jerker with the two brothers fighting out each other, but more than that their own demons. One gets to see that blood is indeed thicker than water, but without the message being drilled into place.Worth seeing again and again. 10/10.",10,2,5,26 December 2011
