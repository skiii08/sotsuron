Iron Man 3," Enjoyed it, really looking forward to the Director's Cut
","I wish they had more time to cleanup the ending but apparently they cut 1:30 minutes from the movie and, hopefully, the DVD release will be a directors cut. If its like the LOTR DVD Director's cut, it could feel like an entirely new movie. I had the pleasure of working as an extra on this movie when they filmed a great deal of it in Wilmington, NC last summer. As a guy not trying to be an actor or 'make it' it was fascinating to see how a major production works behind the scenes. The casting director was incredibly cool and the crew seemed the same. I was real impressed with Downey Jr. too. Of course we were the equivalent of a potted plant in the movie but the experience was special. I sincerely hope the bring Avengers 2 to film in Wilmington.",9,0,3,1 June 2013
