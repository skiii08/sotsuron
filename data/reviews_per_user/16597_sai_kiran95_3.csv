Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Enjoyed it. Easily one of the best movies of the year.
","I enjoyed the movie a lot and I rate it as one of the best movies of the year. The lead actors Robert Downey Jr and Jude law are too good and the rapport between them is fantastic. The plot, dialogues, music everything is good about the movie. I am a great fan of the director Guy Ritchie and he lived upto my expectations. Especially the climax scenes between sherlock Holmes and Jared Harris are too good. In fact I loved this movie more than Sherlock Homes(2009). On the flip side, I could have enjoyed more with normal action sequences instead of kung fu. If you enjoyed Sherlock Holmes(2009), then you will definitely enjoy this movie more than 1st part.",8,18,37,16 December 2011
Hugo," Visual Grandeur. But the film is boring most of the times.
","Saw the movie at an advance screening with my friends. The first hour and half of the movie is quite boring. The visuals are good, sets are amazing but the movie lacks the pace. The trailer looks like the movie for the kids but I think they will feel bored watching the movie because it is a family sentimental drama. I am a great fan of Martin Scorsese films but this one is not quite good as his other films. The kids Asa Butterfield and ChloÃ« Grace Moretz did an amazing job and Ben Kingsley is superb. I don't think these kind of drama films need 3D. I could have enjoyed this film more in 2D than 3D. But here and there there are couple of good 3D visuals. If you like a good family sentimental drama film with slow pace then go and watch it, otherwise skip it.",4,13,29,23 November 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The best action entertainer of the year. Must watch it on IMAX screen.
","This movie is one of the best action entertainer of the year. I watched the movie on IMAX screen and thrilled by the action episodes. It was very thrilling to watch Tom Cruise jumping from 'Burj Kahlifa' and running on it(Tom did these scenes with out a dupe and they are superb on big screen). The characters played by Simon Pegg, Jeremy Runner and Paula Patton are fun to watch. The action sequences especially, chase scenes in Sand Storm are amazing to watch. I didn't watch any Brad Bird(Director)past movies but after watching this movie I felt that we can expect some good action entertainers from him. Everyone in the cast and crew excelled. Don't miss this fun, action entertainer and Please watch this movie on IMAX screen. One word I can say is 'Ethan Hunt is back'.",9,4,7,18 December 2011
