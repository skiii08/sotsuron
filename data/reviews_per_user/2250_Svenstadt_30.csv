Blade Runner 2049," Saved by the visuals, gritty and sensual; but not enough to recommend it.
","It is hard to recommend this film. I had high hopes for this. I could sum this film up by parsing about the last 4/5th of the way through this film: it felt like the old fart Harrison Ford 'handing off' the blade runner role to a younger guy who could do more with it. In that sense it felt kinda like in Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning. 
That's not the only aspect of the story that was old and cliched. The film basically revolves around the 'humanitarian mission to save innocent life'. It is all about finding this girl who was a 'miracle child' born of both human and replicant which should not be possible. The corporate CEO who sells the replicants, played by Jared Leto, wants the child for his own purposes, while different factions argue back and forth. This is very Big Lebowski-esque in that it is a complicated back-and-forth changing storyline (which I hate), and I felt that, like Terminator: Salvation, at a certain point the plot just fell apart. 
The good of this film is that it has a very 'techno-punk' feel and gets you into a deep, dark mood. It has an almost trance-like essence in every scene. BTW, there is quite a bit of nudity and adult content, some gun violence as well as physical violence. 
I did however become a fan of Ryan Gosling after this. I could see his works again and in my mind he has a Bruce Willis / Arnold Schwarzenegger, leading-man quality to his performances.",6,3,6,10 April 2018
War Dogs," Like a less intelligent 'Lord Of War'
","Much like 'American Made' and 'Atomic Blonde,' this also mismatches the cast and turns what should be a drama into an action film with the wrong feel to it. Miles Teller looks like a boy scout. The attempt at irony and juvenile sarcasm that was present in L.O.W. in a sort of narrative style of the very dry delivery of Nick Cage was poorly copied in this turd.",2,7,9,12 December 2019
It," add 'S.H.' and you have what this movie is
","Where to begin. Every low-budget movie clichÃ© is in this movie. It is just your typical, annoying, teenager slasher movie that I hated growing up. The best part (and scariest) was at the beginning when the kid gets his arm bitten off and dragged into the storm drain by Pennywise. (BTW no indication of who Pennywise is or where he comes from in the movie, only that he is a figment of the children's fears).These teenagers make liberal use of 'f' word about as much as the Big Lebowski does.Of course there is the typical every-child's-home-life is messed up clichÃ©', and there's the town bully clichÃ©', and the tomgirl clichÃ©',and all that sappy Hallmark-style acting. There's the obsessive-compulsive Jewish friend clichÃ©', the Magical Negro clichÃ©',there's no end to it. The studious fat kid clichÃ©'.This movie is basically summed up like this: autonomous kids with no parental supervision wander around town in the style of Goonies, but only with less purpose and drive, and with some jilted dialogue to explain what they're doing. Supposedly, this clown only appears in town every 27 years (according to research the group does with newspaper archives and microfilm). Again, the movie ends with no better explanation than in the beginning. Oh, it likes the town's storm drains for some reason......At the end, through a process I refer to as Digital Judaism, aka special effects, lol, they manage to kill this thing, and if you can figure out who put in the killing blows I will give you $500, because the camera work and/or screenplay is terrible. The only thing I look forward to is more movies with that tomgirl, because she was very charming and cute and I want to see what she looks like all grown up.",3,5,10,16 September 2017
The Big Lebowski," A little far out of left field but nonetheless solid, gripping tale.
","This movie has a big personality, and I could have given it a 10, but I felt that a 9 was more appropriate. This is basically a post-modern tale that anyone growing up in the 90's will understand. Everyone should find this entertaining, especially on re-runs on all the networks. 
It requires attention span as the story is rather complicated. It also has a great number of characters to introduce. But the filmmakers do it so well that it doesn't lose any points. 
I didn't give it a 10 because it is so outlandish and over-the-top that even the most gullible will want to walk away from it at times. There is a character, played by John Turturro, who is a registered sex offender, who plays bowling alongside the three main characters in league bowling, and they felt the need to do a cut-scene to tell his story, even though he is only in one scene. Also, there is the guy who is a stage actor, who wants the Dude to go to his performance, and the dude nearly forgets - this character has nothing at all to do with this movie, so the scenes changed about every 2 minutes!!! Also, John Goodman's character getting away with threatening to shoot someone in public, and the cops show up and somehow miss him!! Way too over-the-top. It felt at times like a pornographic display of garishness.",9,0,1,10 April 2018
Fury," Strong performances and special effects pick up the slack of this schnooze-fest.
","This movie really shows how well Brad Pitt has aged as an actor over the years. He and Shia LeBeof really give great performances that add to the suspense. Brad Pitt is a laser-focused combat officer with a certain vinegar-laced personality, and Shia LeBoeuf plays a religiously inclined main gunner who is perhaps his second-best soldier. 
This story moves along too slowly for my taste. There's alot of stopping and starting in the action, and at least one scene we see in every war movie: soldiers bust in to someone's home and take advantage of their food supply and recharge their batteries. One of the crew has a romantic relationship with a German girl in the home he busts into. It might be a real experience in war but I think I've seen it one too many times. 
The one thing you WON'T get in this movie is any sort of epic tank battles such as made the theatre of the Atlantic Campaign famous. The movie starts out inside the tank after a mission, and the forward machine gunner is killed; all you see is his bloody neck stump and spine sticking out which is graphic. 
I reduced one star because this movie has moments where the action isn't that great. In a couple of scenes guys are getting blown up everywhere, and in real life there would be grunts and cries for mommy and, well, internal organs lying everywhere, but in this movie they clean it up too too much. I heard that the insides of those Sherman tanks looked like slaughterhouses at the end of a mission! There is the one crew member who gets a Panzerfaust rocket cut straight through his abdomen, but very little guts and grizzle are seen! Another guy leans into a German grenade, but again, there should be blood everywhere, but there isn't!!!!! 
There's alot of German language in this movie. As having taken four years of high school German, I can appreciate that part of it. But still, this movie's setting takes place later in the Atlantic Campaign, so there's really often times no direction in this. Very much feels like the film stops where it starts and starts where it stops. There are a few tank battles but are so brief that you tend to get bored. 
Also, the German gunners in that one scene are firing into the tanks, and miss three times in a row!!! No way that is true; I happen to know that the Germans were reknowned for their accuracy and the Sherman was an easy target.",6,1,3,24 April 2018
Fight Club," Hardly even entertaining, and a poor attempt at punk imitation.
","OK, normally I identify with punk movies, but this one just doesn't work out. It is an aimless odyssey into a void of aimless people that moves along without direction. PS - another reason to hate this film: I believe the trend towards male frontal nudity in film started with this POS. I hate this movie even more than Freddie Got Fingered, and that is hard to do. This movie was supposed to invoke some sort of anti-corporate, primal rage sort of message, but it just didn't work.",4,1,4,28 April 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Should be called Star Wars: A Dying Franchise
","Terrible. Not even worth the money. It looked like a 5 year old playing with his daddy's computer put in the digital effects. I tried to take it seriously, but then Y Tu Mama Tambien entered the scene and I couldn't take it seriously. In space no one can hear your bad accent.Felicity Jones is a joke. She is a cute face and that's all. Forest Whitaker gave something worse than his performance in Battlefield Earth. All the characters act like patients in the psych ward, they're too cartoonish. It's like they spent too much time with Angelina Jolie.I object to them using Grand Boff Tarkin's likeness in digital form. After about 10 seconds on screen, you can tell it is digitized. They put Carrie Fisher in it digitally and I think this is something they should stop doing! Seriously. A crappy end to a crappy movie. Oh in case you don't know, this movie ends exactly where A New Hope begins. Let's face it, like Terminator franchise, there are some sci-fi movies where, you must leave much to the imagination, because exploring a back story ruins everything. This is another such franchise that should have been left alone.",3,1,2,21 July 2017
Doctor Strange," I personally loved this film. And that's no small feat!
","this movie has it all. Character development, slight romance (not too heavy), action, loss and sorrow, good acting, good story, and perhaps most importantly, the potential for sequels.That is by far the thing I am looking for most of all. I knocked two stars off my rating for two reasons: anti Christian bigotry planted subtly in the movie, and because digital effects go a little too far at places.There is a scene where Mads Mikkelson's character and his two zealot henchmen are conducting an occult ritual in what is clearly a Catholic Cathedral in New York.... Whoever directed this needs a kick in the face for that scene alone! I am soooo sick of this crap!Also, the digital stuff goes a little far in places. It gets right onto the high-wire of being in bad taste, but thankfully pulls back.",8,2,2,29 July 2017
Predator," Totally overrated in retrospect.
","Looking back at this film, it is obvious now that it is just another campy sack of garabaggio!! Ok first of all, it is an '80's action movie, so of course you're gonna have Arnold, Sonny Landham, Jessie Ventura, that Sven Thurston guy who's in all Arnold movies, Chubbs Peterson - the only person missing is Rae Dawn Chong, right? Anyway, so the special effects are cheesy at best. The absolute worst thing about this movie is the music!! The music just grinds against your ears in the worst way. It isn't suspenseful, it makes you wonder when it will all end!! Another thing is that the violence is really just gratuitous and made me uncomfortable. The Predator is sufficiently menacing. The only really tying force for this movie, as in Predator 2, is the interaction of the characters and how their losses affect them. This was a particularly binding force for this movie. Another funny thing were the joke-telling scenes, where a character shares some very adult jokes to his buddy!!! The mission scene was no good, even by '80s standards!!! No Special Forces (sic) teams that I know have a guy carrying a helicopter mounted gatling gun. It would be near impossible to handle. (BTW - they weren't special 'forces', they were Special Ops, there's a huge difference in reality. Spec. Ops do really hard tactical missions like rescues and sabotage and assassinations; Special Forces were the pussies who tried to teach the ARVN to fight in Vietnam, and we all know that ended well!!!). The end fight might be the worst of all. There's no way Arnold could have taken those grenade launchers apart and used them in the arrows - they would not explode without a primer and after you tear them apart they are no good!! Also, for a guy like him, even though he IS Arnold, still could not have made such an elaborate labyrinth of traps during his last stand fight. I thought Predator 2 was about 20x better, it was much more menacing, much more dramatic. I know alot of people will disagree with me, but I like it better.",4,4,16,12 October 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Awesome effort and great fun.
","This movie is very raw and violent and is not for children. The action is solid, and it has some heart-churning moments, from John and Sarah in the car after the escape, to the ending. There are plenty of crying moments. In short, this is a complete action movie, with an ability to segue from one scene to another that hasn't been matched since then. The movie flows well, and the music matches the pace of the movie in lockstep. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because of the few mistakes, which kind of stand out: Arnold saying 'Hasta la Vista, baby,' only to say next 'We don't have much time,' was out of place; next mistake was when Arnold says, 'I need a vacation,' after killing the T-1000, when he didn't learn to say that in the movie. Another mistake, the T-1000 didn't imitate the Arnold Terminator when he walked down to the garage - he could have fooled John and killed him then and there, because he had already touched Arnold during the fight in the galleria. Another bad part was when the orderly at the mental institution licks Sarah Connor's face, this made it into an even more disturbing film! In fact, all the mental hospital scenes were disturbing! Another part I felt was getting bad was after the mental hospital escape, and they start introducing character after character after character!! Luckily, I think they put a cap on the number of characters being introduced. This movie was about 1 step away from being a little too long and too epic and too violent and too menacing. I found the death scene of the T-1000 believable, if not a bit convenient. The deleted scene, where T-1000 malfunctions after being frozen, was a good scene. It seems that nothing other than molten steel could kill that thing.",9,3,3,1 December 2019
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Good as certain things, but not for what it is marketed as.
","This movie disappoints in the respect that it was so many things to so many different people, but was marketed all wrong. This would make a new genre called 'light, romantic comedy' if such a category existed!! This is so light on real, actual humor and redeeming value. The commercialization of this movie was just terrible, such as promoting adult films starring a certain actress I found to be more of the same. The promotion was shameless. It could be considered a teen comedy, I guess... The quirky, somewhat zany acting of the different roles really kept me from giving it a lower rating. Everyone starring in this adds their own flavor and personality, and luckily they blend together on screen very well. Of course, the story is so predictable and sappy-sweet that it makes you want to vomit. I could take it or leave it. It seems to me that with the amount of era-specific comedians who star in this, this movie will lose value over time about as fast as a GM vehicle!",4,0,0,11 May 2020
Dunkirk," Overall good summer actioner that also honors those who served.
","I saw only two good summer movies this year worthy of note: Wonder Woman and this film! Very good movie.Be warned that although not gory, it is kinda scary at several points, and the 'jump' factor is pretty high at several points.I'm impressed by both Wonder Woman and this film by the way the directors were able to escape the usual remakes and what has been done before, and come up with new ways to awaken theaters. These two films truly give an uplifting message and leave a big impression on you.This movie has a way of putting you in the action and letting you live it, as opposed to narrating what you should think (ie The heros of the film aren't given the usual honors in war films, but you root for them as you're watching) I feel that this is the real way combat would be, and Nolan does a good job of giving a realistic sort of feel to the combat that people would expect I think of real combat would be like.Only criticism: it starts off kinda fast and intense, and then slowly you get more comfortable as the action becomes more and more predictable. This is actually a good thing because you can feel that tense nature of what I feel real war would be like. The adrenaline drains and you get tired just like a soldier in combat, and you can feel that. I haven't really seen that before on film. It has kind of a Quentin Tarantino style of narration, like in Pulp Fiction, it has an out-of-order sequence of events and your mind has to put it into order.If there were more films like this, people would get tired of them. I feel this standalone movie tells a powerful story and Nolan did a good job. Will this movie be forgotten? Most likely. But it does deserve kudos.",10,3,17,21 July 2017
American History X," Well done, but too preachy.
","Call me a cynic, but this is just more of the same from Hollywood. Stylistically, the film is impressive. But the conclusions drawn are all wrong!
PS- I could have done without the prison rape scene, and could have seen some more of Fairuka Balk sex scenes would have been nice!
Leftists always give you the same ad-hominem attacks... 'These are people who think that time has passed them by...', or, 'Racists do what they do because they are insecure'... bla bla bla!
I love the scene at the dinner table, where the guy who's the Jew dating the lead's mother says, 'these are people that feel alienated by the system'....
Oh please, spare me!! The only thing that matters in this world, that matters to God, is the actions that you take!! Your own internal dialogue, as this character seems to be suggesting, is something that dominates our personality in the end, and there is no free will. But since not everyone acts on those impulses, the results of our actions are the only tangible things others can see!!
That being said, this movie is entirely believable, and the main character completely justified. This film seems to take the left-wing, communist path of 'destroy the individual, by attacking his motivations and not his actions.'
Communist liberals don't really care that there are dead bodies in the streets... they care about tearing down the concept of right and wrong... Case in point? Derek, the main character, becoming overly violent on the night in question that landed him in jail on murder charges. Ask yourself: would Derek have been a hero if he had simply shot the guy who broke into his truck, to leftists? No, he would not have been!! He would have been a hero if he had left the guy go and steal his truck. Why? Because, leftist communists are hypocrites, and believe in 'one standard for those who help bring about the divide, and another for those who call for the same standards of behavior for all.' Communists can only come to power when society is divided. Then, they sneak in and steal the country while people are looking to fight each other, and not them!! Hence, the real racists are on the left!!! What does all this mean? It means, you cannot put a guy like Derek through the loss of his father, constant harassment in life, and expect him to react as a pacifist. As it is, the film only serves, in my humble opinion, to further the divide. The real statement of this movie is: There is one standard of behavior for blacks and other minorities, and an entirely other standard for whites (which is to say: bend over and take it because we have had it too good for too long!)>>.....",5,3,10,14 November 2018
American History X," Tries to find a causal string that doesn't exist!
","The one problem I have with this movie is that the theme gets pounded into your head in every single sentence of dialogue, as if race issues are all these people talk about at home. Every scene never deviates from this formulaic bummer.
Another problem I have with it is that it blames the Vinyard family (ie Ed Norton, Ed Furlong, and company) for all the problems in the movie, as if some invisible ether on their souls is invisibly causing all these social problems that they face!
Not one single white person in the movie committed a major crime- that would be all the black characters in the movie! And yet, being a mildly bad Nazi in a gang formed out of necessity, oh! Why that is bordering on unforgiveable!
How about some logic applied to these academic eggheads?? Maybe next time, make a movie about white people who live on their own, where they don't have to face the challenges of a multi-racial hell hole like Los Angeles!! You mix races and ethnicities together, and most people recognize, you're gonna have problems no matter how hard you try!!",5,1,6,30 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Better than I thought it would be - worthy sequel.
","I thought I would be in for a disappointment, but luckily was not let down. Everything about this is solid. (I did not like Avengers: Age of Ultron) This I liked. There is one scene which I did not understand - perhaps someone could help me?? The remaining Avengers must travel back in time, to collect the Infinity Stones before Thanos can get his hands on them. So they go to the headquarters where Loki is being held, but they make a mistake, and they drop the case one of them is in, and Loki grabs it, then disappears?? We never see him for the rest of the movie??? Maybe it was just me, or there is something there that I missed. Either way, it is a solid film, but keep in mind, it is a time travel film, mostly. There is very little action other than the ending. A few of your favorite characters (might be / are) lost, for good now.... They keep the recapping to a minimum, which is another thing they did right. It feels not like a rehash, but maintains its own feel, unlike sooo many time travel films which do it wrong! The story flows perfectly, unlike Age of Ultron which I disliked. This has more of a character-centered feel to it. I still say that Infinity War was better, but this has its own charms in its own right.",10,1,6,4 May 2019
Tigerland," Best war movie I've ever seen.
","This movie has all the right elements in it and strikes a sympathetic tone. Colin Farrell is the kind of hero that makes movies great; he makes you want to care about the character. Also, it is a war movie but isn't set in war but rather before the war, and the stress going into the war is often greater than the war itself, so it has a kind of ' more is less ' thing going on in that sense. This movie could be described as extremely raw in nature: the sex scene is raw and very hot, the performances are raw, the fight scene between the hero and villain, Pvt. Wilson, makes you feel like you are witnessing a real fight. You will feel the stress as the characters move into and out situations of what you think you would feel in real life. In addition to having a realistic portrayal of the attitudes of the characters at this point in the war which, having studied Vietnam, I can tell you it is consistent with actual experiences.",10,3,5,11 April 2018
Toy Story 4," Fast paced and fresh, but too fast.
","The story is solid, although there is so much going on, and so much dialogue, that you really need to be focused intently the whole way through. From what I could grasp of the basic storyline, there is plenty of cuteness the whole way through. In the end, there is a surprise. Perhaps not really a surprise, much like how Sling Blade began and it was obvious what would happen. The real problem I have with this movie is that there is alot of motion, and you have to really be able to watch this on a day when you are focused enough for your brain to process it: I mean, there is an RV road trip element to this movie, and the toys are constantly moving around, so it is important to follow what they are doing, intently. I think small children might have problems following it as well... However, the basic plot has villains, some peril, and some very relatable subject matter for children, which makes it a wholesome family film.",6,0,4,4 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," I don't understand what all the fuss is about this one.
","This was a half-decent movie. I really like the parts that have Dr. Strange in them. If there is one criticism of this movie, it is that of the decisions of the heroes and the mistakes they make during the course of the plot. It's like they're all suffering from Bipolar and can't compose themselves or take themselves seriously enough to get a grip! I mean after all, the fate of the entire UNIVERSE is at stake!!!! Yes that is literally the plot line. I will now have to do some research because I am not a comic book guy, so this peeked my interest.",7,3,8,27 May 2018
Gone Girl," Suck-tastic
","If you get bored easily with overly dramatic acting, bad crime drama, this is certainly it. Oh, and if you don't want to see Ben Afflecks dick, don't watch this. What is it with movies always flashing dicks nowadays, anyway? Everyone does it and it isn't funny! There weren't any boobies or anything, but there was Ben Affleck's endowment which was quite large. What kind of psychopath acts this way? OK, so Ben's wife is crazy, OK, but I don't know of serial killers who think that far ahead, OK. Real life serial killers are usually fringe dwellers and not so intellectual.This is another Hollywood cliché': that Hannibal Lecter is some kind of genius who fell from grace. Psychopathy is apparent by your teenage years, and if you aren't someone important by your mid-20's, you will be a loser for life.It has Doogie Howser, and he gets killed in the act with Ben's supposed missing wife. The movie basically lost me at this point it was so boring.",4,1,5,22 July 2017
Gran Torino," Another set-piece movie that is like a bad night at the theatre.
","This movie is just riddled with inaccuracies and mistakes. First of all, a Catholic priest will NEVER come to you to coerce a confession out of you! EVER!! Second, being a nostalgic older man who is behind the times is not a sin!! Neither is having an unfavorable attitude about the bad things happening in your neighborhood! Neither is being rigid and stubborn!!
That said, Clint's acting has hit a new low. His grumble whenever something annoys him is about as forced as his twin-speech on Dirty Harry.
Another error is the portrayal of Asian people in general. Asians definitely don't run around in that many gangs throughout America, and are generally not so incompetent even if they do!! The scene where they bring massive amounts of gifts to Walt's front door is stereotypical and insulting as hell!!! So is the portrayal of Asian religious beliefs!!
As is usual with the race hustlers in this country, they get almost everything wrong, including the identity of the problem!! This movie moves within about 1 square block of this tiny street with row houses, and a grumpy guy with a small lawn!! The movie is about as preachy as a high school health class video!!!
The story revolves around the stealing of this old man's prized possession, a Gran Torino car, in mint condition. A slow witted Asian with some form of autism, is coerced by his gang-member distant relatives to steal it, which he fails to do!! I mean, that scene was about as bad as it could get!!! You can't sympathize with a character who never speaks!!! This entire film is riddled with very embarrassing misnomers.
In the end, they turn this Walt Kowalski guy into the liberal conformist pushover they want him to be!! It's just entirely embarrassing and insulting to the intelligence of the audience!!! The idea that there would be gangs in this multi-ethnic city without any drug dealing is just absurd!!!
Another aspect of this that I found is that this movie is abusive towards white people!! You heard right!!! There is an old, mean Asian grandmother who, from her front porch, begins releasing a diatribe to Walt about how he should have moved out long ago!! I'm sorry, this whole line of thinking is an abusive excuse for abusing white people!!! This idea that we should have moved if we didn't want to have to deal with the crime in our area!!! This idea that it is somehow a sin to be 'behind the times'!!!",1,0,5,10 March 2020
Clash of the Titans," A good actioner for people who like buddy-hero movies with mythological elements.
","This movie does a great job. It does not try to be too much at any one time. Sam Worthington does a fantastic job, even though not much from the role is expected from him. He makes a convincing hero. If you are a fan of all things Western Civilization, then this will give you enough red meat to be satisfied. The SFX are likewise not overdone, but also not too sloppy. Perseus is the half-son of Zeus, raised by common fishermen, and the family gets killed early on.
Perseus must stop the destruction of man at the hands of the rebellious Pantheon. In case you were wondering, at the end, he confronts Medusa by using the Shield of Aegis, and seeing the reflection on the shield, closes his eyes, does a backwards spin, and beheads Medusa. He then, with eyes closed, places the head in a bag, goes to Rhodes, and then, eyes closed again, pulls the head out of the bag and shows the giant, turning the him into stone. Also great to have along the ride are Liam Neeson and other excellent supporting cast.",8,0,1,23 December 2019
Reservoir Dogs," I dare say a bit better than Pulp Fiction.
","This was actually the movie that got Tarantino on the map, not Pulp Fiction. Having seen Pulp Fiction first, watching this, I was just blown away by the acting and the suspense of this all. I think with Pulp Fiction, it was kind of like Reservoir Dogs 2.0. I think this is by far the better installment. There's much more blood and violence in this one. The story flows much better.",9,0,0,17 May 2020
Pulp Fiction," Too much of Tarantino's humor, and short on substance.
","It would be hard to call this a bad movie because it isn't. I find it to be much overrated, just on account of all the trendy, popular sentiment the film contains, which are plentiful in Tarantino movies, from his silly lines he wrote for Crimson Tide, to other things. The movie is chock full of cliches and recurrent motifs: from Marcellus Wallace always getting raped constantly, to Butch's good luck, to Vincent Vega (John Travolta) always being in the bathroom when something important happens, to Jules Winfield's (Samuel L. Jackson) moving sermons which seemingly summons supernatural deliverance for him. Even still, the pacing is uneven. The movie ends where it began, in the diner. This is effective, but I felt in watching it that they do certain things merely for the shock value. People know that naughty things sell well. It is done so well, however, that you quickly realize how good the movie was. The downside is that you are unsure whom to sympathize with. These are all very bad people, and none of them really grow into characters to either villify or root for. For example, when Vincent Vega dies, you want to laugh, since he dies on the toilet, being knocked back by the recoil of the gun. It's pretty funny when the toaster pops, then he gets blasted! But you don't know what to think or feel anywhere in this movie. This movie contains just a series of victims on an on-again, off-again roller coaster. I don't see the need to ever see this again, because it simply tells a story and doesn't elicit any sympathy at all. If anything, the person you should feel sorry for, Marcellus, isn't given enough screen time and isn't the main character. The main plot is the briefcase, which, some have said, contains Marcellus's very soul. This seems pretty silly as a plot point since this is a guy ordering hits constantly and getting raped repeatedly.
The title pretty much says it all in the beginning definition of the word: it is Pulp Fiction.",7,0,1,1 December 2019
American Made," Just another clichéd 80's biopic that is low on facts
","NONE of the history in this movie is accurate! Barry Seal started running drugs and getting in trouble with the law in the late 70's, before Reagan was even President.Cruise's performance is one-dimensional at best. I was never a fan of his acting. IYAM, he is overrated.There was also a part of this film that was never explained, and that was, why was he video taping himself? It never did explain what happened to the tapes he made, shown in the back of his car in boxes.......Yeah this movie sucks out loud. Oh yeah, he dies at the end. And then it wraps up with clips of Ronald Reagan talking about the 'Just Say No' campaign. This is intended to make him look like a hypocrite. This is on par with Sully, a Clint Eastwood snooze fest. 'Let's wrap a story around an obscure event and sell it as more exciting than it is'No wonder the box office is suffering. The Hollywood Libu-tards feel the need to lecture the young people who hadn't lived through the '80s now.",4,16,30,20 October 2017
The Wolf of Wall Street," Such a riotous piece of entertainment!
","Never has there been a better celebration of the excesses of life than this gem! I can only find fault with the brief glimpses of nudity and sex scenes, which are well spread out and numerous, but always portrayed as a tease, and never long enough to be titillating. Margot Robbie was not allowed to be the sexy girl as she should have been. She played the trophy wife, but was very unappealing and unlikeable in the role. That aside, this is a buddy movie, where you call your friend up and say, 'you won't believe what they did in this thing!' There are so many scenes that are just outrageous! This isn't meant to be strictly biographical, because it wouldn't have sold very well. The supporting actors and actresses are outstanding. This is a must-see!",9,0,1,27 December 2019
Lord of War," Good entertainment for a change with an interesting actors / characters.
","Almost everything about this movie is good. If you're a fan of political dramas, this is it for you. Jared Leto plays Nick Cage's right-hand wingman and brother. They are illegal arms dealers, and spend the movie running surplus guns after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and in the process are responsible for some of the worst wars and mass killings in 3rd world countries around the world. The only problem is, Jared Leto is the weak conscientious person, and ultimately his anxiety leads to his demise. I found it difficult to ponder why Nick Cage's character, at the point where his own brother gets shot by the guns he supplied to the warlord, even then does not develop a conscience?? That was surprising. Then you have the very annoying and one-dimensional Ethan Hawke's character, who plays the overly zealous Federal Agent who can never seem to get enough evidence to throw Nick Cage in jail. Even in the end, no one grows into anything better than what they started out as.
The reason I didn't give this a 10 or 9 is because it feels a little too long, even though it might not seem that way. Also, it does not hold up to repeated viewing, for some reason. You don't really feel redeemed by having watched this. This is an artistic work, but it lacks any sort of message in the end. Nick Cage, I guess, does a good job doing what he does (ie playing the dry wit of the movie). Therein lies another problem: Nick Cage has about 2 characters that he re-hashes: he is either Cameron Poe from Con-Air, or he is the guy from The Rock.
Ultimately, this movie is very materialist-centered, and at points it feels more like it is a rap video rather than a drama.",8,0,0,14 December 2019
The Big Short," Sort of interesting, but falls flat on its face.
","This was worth watching, but at points is rather painful to get through. I thought the actors and actresses chosen, and their portrayals, are the let down. In the style of Family Guy, there are many sub-scenes within a scene giving context. However, the scene with Margo Robbie in a hot tub explaining things seemed exploitative and forced rather than trendy, which is what they were aiming for. Of course, this is Hollywood, so they try to give you only half the explanation for what happened. I mean, as a biopic, it does OK, but not every minor detail is 100%. But in Hollywood, they try the little guy vs evil, greedy businessman routine, which got old. Steve Carell falls flat, as does Ryan Gosling. They're all kind of robotic. Brad Pitt's brief role is always welcome. The problem is, you will compare this in your mind to much better movies of a similar style. It has the feel of a grade-school video lecture. I don't understand why I'm always at odds with the critics, but that's my take. I can't quite call it a full-blown schmooze-fest movie.",6,1,3,23 February 2020
Platoon," Too formulaic for a war movie.
","This movie would have been good, if not for the scriptwriting and directing. This almost feels more like a Shakespeare play than an actual war movie. No one in Vietnam, in the heat of combat, is going to find the time to hump through the jungle to frag one of your own guys. The conflict between Willem Dafoe's character and Tom Berenger's character gets a little too cartoonish and too convenient at times. Charlie Sheen does an OK job. I have been told that pretty much every aspect of this movie is accurate. Dale Dye, an actual Vietnam soldier and advisor, acted as well to add some realism to this piece. The soundtrack is another bummer in this movie as well. There are no period-authentic pieces, like on Forest Gump with Fortunate Son. The soundtrack only further adds to the aggravation of the movie which seems to force a history lesson down your throat at times.",4,2,5,3 April 2019
Wonder Woman," Just what was needed in a sea of politically correct SFX garbage.
","Edit - something I missed during my initial review - What really struck me about the film was the really blatant feminism of this whole thing. For I think the first time in film really, you have a male lead playing the feminine role, and the female lead playing a man's role! Chris Pine can pull that off well - he's kind of a small man, very polite, sort of a damsel in distress at times. And you have Gal Gadot who has a deep, agressive voice at times, pushing on without cease til the end. Chris Pine is kind of the T-1000 character - he is an allied spy and he uses this ability several times to infiltrate, and is kind of the conscience of the film.This movie is, in short, astounding! Chris Pine is a great actor to bring into this part, although I thought that at times he seemed a bit preachy and couldn't let go of his Captain Kirk persona. The setting is World War I, but at times it seemed like an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, where the humans help the aliens navigate the culture of the day. In short: it gets old, but fortunately it didn't go too far. As an admirer of history, there were nuggets of the prevailing culture of the day that even the hero, Diana, the wonder woman, found hard to grasp. Gal Gadot's beauty carried the movie away, her every pose in the movie was beautiful. There is no such thing as a bad scene with her in it!There are lots of references to ancient Hellenic (Greek mythology) which I found endearing. The action scenes were pretty solid, although I thought there could have been more.The movie is not silly like some action movies like Independence Day 1 & 2 which is a good thing.The themes were not political in nature which is another plus. The theme seems to be: man himself is a beast who brings evil upon himself. The entire film flows very well together. I think the reason this film is popular is because it is something fresh and new and different.Gal Gadot's performance was good. However, I found that the character was a little wet-behind-the-ears. Maybe this was intentional, as she was supposed to portray a naive young woman, but I felt that in several scenes, she should have scratched her head and asked more questions and been a little more reflective and less hormonal. You get the impression that the writers / directors were missing several character development points and plot points I thought went unanswered. I wish to compare her performance to Milla Jovovich in 5th Element. At the end of that movie, MJ shows a little bit of vulnerability in her character. I wonder if Gal Gadot is capable of the same range as an actress as MJ, but this may be scriptural problem.",8,5,11,4 June 2017
The Silence of the Lambs," Overrated, intellectualized, ritualized trash heap!
","This movie is just a mess from beginning to end. First of all, actors and actresses have a tendency to overact, so writers and directors will always try to throw realism out the window so that they can indulge themselves! While the character of Dr. Lecter is not technically impossible, it is highly unlikely. Sociopaths in real life are much more likely to be low functioning, impulsive, and not very good book learners. So this movie starts off with a bad premise. I'm not a very big fan of Jodie Foster movies to begin with, and her character is very annoying to me. The best part of the entire film is the Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) scenes. The idea that Lecter would give Starling such highly intellectualized clues is improbable, but I suppose I am being overly critical here. This is still less annoying than Manhunter, but not by much!!",3,2,8,5 April 2019
