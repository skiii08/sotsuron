Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hands Down Funniest Movie Ever
","I watch a lot of movies in my time. And a lot of television. Mostly, because I have no life. This is hands down... funnier than all of them.The movie plot is simple. Borat comes to America to make a documentary, and in the process searches to marry Pamela Anderson. But Cohen is so funny. Now, I heard many, many people talking about how 'anti-semetical' this movie is- and how offensive it is to the Jewish race.I'm Jewish myself, and as offensive as it was- the offense meant NOTHING. Why? Because Sasha Cohen (Borat) is Jewish in reality. And well, you're allowed to make fun of yourself. Granted, I'm also Russian, and therefore Borat's character becomes that much more relatable. There's a naked fight scene, yes. It was funny.The funniest parts of the movie has to do with Borat as a journalist. Not only does he mess with congressmen, but in the process he exposes them for being racist.How great is that?Go see the film. If you hate it- it's okay. Only then do you have the right to not like it.",10,4,17,3 November 2006
The Fifth Element," Best sci flick of all time?
","This is my favourite sci-fi action film. Granted, I don't think I can call the 'Back to the future' series action films, but regardless its sci-fi. 5th Element, for lack of a better word, just owns. Bruce Willis does an impressive performance. And that red-headed girl (Don't remember her name at this second) is just gorgeous! At times, I found Chris Tucker to be annoying.Anyways, the movie gives you everything you've ever wanted in a sci-fi flick.'Sir, are you designated as human?' 'No, Sir, I am a meat popsicle' Great lines. =)",10,1,2,5 March 2006
Spider-Man 3," Cheesy- yet entertaining
","This movie felt like classic Sam Raimi directing, way more than the other 2 Spiderman movies. The movie had god-awful dialog and the acting was poor. Venom looked really cheesy, unless Topher Grace's head was showing. It didn't succeed in pulling 3 stories together (Harry Ozbourne, Venom and Sandman).What this movie DID have, however, is humor. And plenty of it! There is a lot of really subtle comedy in this piece and its well worth your time to go look at it. It felt a LOT like evil-dead kind of funny, where its situational and the dialog is just cheesy enough for it to feel like a classic B-Cult flick. I guess what I'm trying to say is, you shouldn't look at this film in the perspective of a Hollywood blockbuster. You should look at this flick in the perspective of a classic Sam Raimi film and just loosen up.That being said, I was very entertained by this movie. It was the first of the Spiderman- movies to actually look and feel like a comic book! It wasn't like watching a film-adaptation of a comic, it WAS the comic. The action-scenes were really well done. They were cool, for lack of a better word. Especially to see Harry on a hover-board, fighting spider-man.There was little character development, which is fine for characters like Peter and Mary Jane, because they're well established from the last two films.. but, characters like Eddy Brock suffer from it.I wish they'd make a reference to Peter's professor the future Lizardman.I don't think they should make a Fantastic 4 sequel (saw the preview in the theater).So, in conclusion: Its funny, entertaining, Bruce Cambell is the best part. Its got terrible dialog, little character development, etc. If you're a big fan of Spiderman, you'd most likely get offended. If you're a really laid back moviegoer, it might be worth your time and money. I really enjoyed this film, even though it butchers the spider-man story..",8,0,0,10 May 2007
The Fountain," One of the best films I have ever seen.
","The Fountain is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. After seeing Pi, and Reqiuem for a Dream, I had high hopes for Aranofsky's latest flick. And wow, what a film! To me, it no longer became a movie, and became a work of art I couldn't stop staring at. Also, Mansell's music = brilliant. The movie is easier understood after reading the graphic novel.But, I cant critique a movie without saying what it could've improved upon.So, what can it improve upon?The characters backgrounds seemed a little thin. Hugh Jackman was a little over-dramatic at parts, which at times made it unconvincing. Ending was a tiny bit confusing. There was none of Aranofsky's signature 'Hip-Hop' montages. (Although, not a big problem because he makes up with plenty of stunning eye candy what he lacks in montages). I wish there would have been a little more gore. Some scenes should have been done in slow-motion.Mm.. thats about it. Truthfully, this movie is perfect. And I can't stress enough how well the visuals go with the music. Very inspirational.",10,2,4,22 November 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," I'm almost as cool as Ron Burgandy..?
","Ricky Bobby is good. Not anchorman-good, but good nonetheless.The difference between this flick and Anchorman is that this film tries to be more serious. There's a lot of moral conflicts characters bust into, and a lot of philosophical jumble and several scenes were very depressing. This was very entertaining and I really hope Will Farrel will take on another similar role in the future.. Hopefully, the next movie will be funnier.Don't get me wrong! This movie is chuck-full-of-laughs! Just, not nearly as many as Anchorman.I'd definitely recommend it - just don't walk into the theatre thinking you'll be seeing a sequel to Anchorman.",7,0,3,12 August 2006
