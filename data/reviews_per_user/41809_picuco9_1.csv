Requiem for a Dream," disturbingly beautiful
","This is the most disturbing movie I have seen in years, and I loved it. I is beautifully made and wonderfully acted. Jared was excellent, his performance will open many doors. It is very graphic in the depiction in drug addiction, vices and goals. I saw the edited version and can't wait to see the uncut one. I recommend this movie to everyone, well, everyone over 16 at least. :)",9,0,0,1 June 2001
