Walk the Line," This is one amazing film with brilliant performances. I loved it.
","The story of the young Johnny Cash and his love affair with June Carter Cash come to life in Walk the Line. It stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon with the best female performance of the year-no doubt. This movie starts how Johnny Cash got to where he is at, one of the most recognizable artists in history. With his popular country music to the love of his life, June Carter. Johnny meets June at a local concert and I liked the way this movie shows us how they met. Johnny grew up listening to June's music and the way he began to look at her, he saw beauty. Johnny and his band later begin to tour with June and go out there and perform and do they're own shows. Johnny becomes one of the most famous musicians and his singles begin to rise on the billboard. But Johnny takes a wrong turn and begins to pop pills every now and then and his career and his love for June begins to fall apart. June later wouldn't look at him or talk to him. He later turns into a big mess.I really loved this movie but this movie probably wouldn't be the same if the performances weren't there. Reese Witherspoon gave the best performance in this movie and I really think she is a real hot woman. After seeing all her other movies and seeing how she acts in this movie, she is brilliant. Joaquin Phoenix also gave a really powerful performance. I saw the horror film 'Signs', in which he co-stars and it seemed like he was a different person in this film. This is one amazing film with brilliant performances. I loved it.Since the Oscar winner 'Ray' was released 2004 and this was released 2005, I may want to compare it. Although Ray was more depressing in some ways and powerful, Ray beats Johnny Cash but these two movies are both wonderful pieces of work. I am very happy that Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar for 'Best Actress'. She really deserved it.I really loved this movie and I would wanna see it again. This was one of the best movies of 2005 and it is a wonderful piece of work. Everyone should see this movie. 10/10.",10,1,2,20 June 2006
The Longest Yard," I expected it to be a lousy comedy but it wasn't. It was an entertaining comedy.
","The Longest Yard is one of the summer blockbusters. It made near 150 million. There was a lot of talk about it and how it was becoming successful at the box office. But the critics were pretty harsh on this one. Yet, I can see why there were many bad reviews, but this is something different form Adam Sandler. His movies were always the same. The Longest Yard is a little different because it deals with something else. He had two movies that dealt with football. The Waterboy and The Longest Yard. He had the same character as he always did in The Waterboy but his character was different in The Longest Yard. Most of his movie are always funny because of the idiotic things. This is a much different movie than his others.I would have thought The Longest Yard was a lousy and cheesy comedy. It isn't. It was an entertaining comedy that I enjoyed. 7.5/10",7,2,3,8 October 2005
The Notebook," It's a movie where once someone see's it, they talk. Thats why I saw it, now I'm recommending that everyone see's it
","The Notebook, based on the novel stars Rachael McAdams as Young Allie and Ryan Gosling as Yound Noah. The Notebook is a sweeping love story told by a man (Garner) reading from his faded notebook to a woman in a nursing home (Rowlands), The Notebook follows the lives of two teens from very different worlds who spend one happy summer together before they are separated by her parents. They don't see each other for several years, and then they finally reunite where Allie has to choose he first and true love or her fianc√©.I had no interest in The Notebook when it first came out. Then a lot of people were talking and talking about it. So I gave it a chance and watched it and thought it was really good. I'm recommending for everybody to watch it. It is a heartwarming tearjerker, but I had no tears, I just felt the emotion.Rachael McAdams is Hollywood's 'Next Big Thing'. I saw her in 'Mean Girls' and then 'Red Eye', now after seeing her in this, I know she can act. She's pretty hot and I know she'll be doing more movies. She's going to have a great career.I thought this film was really good. I understand what the fuss was about. I give The Notebook an 8/10.",8,0,1,26 February 2006
The Village," Shyamalan's Worst Movie.. Wait better yet, one of the worst movies of the year.
","From the director who brought you Signs, Unbreakbable, and The Sixth Sense comes a story of a small town of people who live in a village. They feel as if they were being haunted by creatures who live beyond their village that live in the woods.There are three rules they follow: Never Enter The Woods That Is Where They Wait Let The Bad Color Not Be Seen It Attracts Them Heed The Warning Bell For They Are Coming If you read all those without seeing the movie, yeah, you might think the movie will be creepy. But its not. It is not as creepy and scary like Signs and The Sixth Sense nor scary. Just a few jump scenes and thats it. I would title this movie as a 'Horror' more like a 'Drama'.I would say the first half of the movie is very boring but you have to listen. I don't know why I nominate this movie as M. Night Shyamalan's worst movie. But I did sorta like it. I liked how the twist reveals it self and I like how the twist of the story is. But The Village isn't as good as M. Night's other movies. I just feel that all his other movies were much better. But I'm not saying that I really hate this movie. No, I'm not saying that, actually I am. I just feel as if this was Shyamalan's worst movie he has directed. I'm not giving this movie a high score like the way Idid for his others. But I'm giving it a fair grade it deserves. I will understand that some people will really hate this movie and some won't. I didn't really enjoy this movie, it felt so boring and the only fine part was towards the end of the movie. I hope Shyamalan's next project isn't as terrible as this. 4/10",3,0,1,3 February 2005
She's the Man," This is the kind of comedy Amanda Bynes should be doing
","It's hard enough being the nerdy new guy on campus without also being the new girl on campus, who has fallen for the coolest guy on campus, who is totally obsessed with the most beautiful girl on campus, who is 'crushing' on the nerdy new guy on campus. That's just the beginning in this contemporary comedy inspired by Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night.' The tagline basically explains what this movie is all about. Amanda Byens stars as Viola. A girl with good looks who is indeed a tomboy, and who loves to play soccer. But when the girls team gets cut off, she decides that she wants to prove that she is good enough. After her brother, Sebastian, played by James Kirk wants to go to London and sing his music, Viola decides to move into his school pretending to be him so she could focus on soccer. So Viola dresses up like her brother and obviously pretends to be him. She later meets her 3 roommates. The three of them think he (she) is loser, but later they soon find out that he can seem pretty cool. One of his (her) roommates is played by Channing Tatum and he plays Duke, the guy who likes Viola but really wants a girl named Olivia and thinks that he can get her if only Sebastian can help him get her. So many things happen in this movie which makes it seem like a 'high school comedy' which they really aren't in high school.I think that Amanda Bynes is very good. This is the kind of comedy she should be doing. She shouldn't be doing movies like 'What A Girl Wants.' I want to see her do some movies like this because she is really good. I grew up watching the hit TV show, 'All That,' which aired on Nickelodeon and featured Amanda in it and she always did good. So I feel that she should be doing more comedic roles. She's really good at them.I felt that this was a funny movie. It may seem predictable because there are so many movies out there in which someone dresses up as the opposite sex and we all know what will happen. There is a girl who falls for a guy who is really a girl. But I liked the way this movie pulled it off. This movie is an underrated movie. I don't why some people missed out on this. It didn't do too well at the box office. A few critics bought it and liked it. I have to agree with them. This was a good movie. So this is why I am recommending it. I give it a 7.5/10.",7,1,2,18 July 2006
Collateral," One Of The Best Movies in 2004
","Collateral stars Tom Cruise (Vincent) as a villain and tells a cab driver, Max (Jamie Foxx) to take him anywhere he wants to go for a one night only kill. Max doesn't really want to but Vincent pushes him to do so. This movie was very well acted by the stars Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise. I really enjoyed this movie, it was action packed and well made from director Michael Mann. Mann made a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. You wouldn't want to leave the theater or turn off your DVD player. Your eyes will be glued to the screen. I guarantee it. You will enjoy the performance that Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx deliver. I really enjoyed this movie while watching it. I really and I mean really recommend it to people who love movies that have excellent actors in an action movie. Its one of the best movies of 2004.",9,0,1,3 February 2005
Batman Begins," I liked how Batman never changes. There were five movies of Batman, including this one. And there were four different people who played him and I liked how it doesn't change.
","Batman:Begins is the prequel to the blockbuster smash hit Batman. The last Batman movie was Batman and Robin. I thought that was a pretty well done movie. It starred George Clooney in the role of Batman. See thats the thing I like about Batman. There were 4 different people playing him in a different film. If someone else played Peter Parker in Spider Man 3, I probably wouldve never watched it. The four Batman actors were Michael Keaten,Val Kilmer, George Clooney and Christian Bale. Its like you cant tell the difference and you can't notice the character. Batman Begins explains everything in the first hour. How Bruce became what he is: Batman. I liked the way everything was explained. But everyone is talking about Katie Holmes and her love life more than the star of this movie and the movie itself. She doesn't have a big role and doesn't have a small role, but it was alright. The ending has all the action. With the big chase scenes. I thought Batman: Beigns was a pretty decent film. But it doesn't add up to last year's Spider Man 2, but it adds up to be one of the biggest movie of the summer.",7,0,1,19 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Very funny, but I just can't compare it to the first.
","Meet The Fockers is one of the biggest comedies of 2004. With huge box office results, it's on the list of the 'Highest Grossing Films of 2004.' I'll say that I laughed a lot during this film. It had it's moments. But the thing is that the first movie, Meet The Parents is an original movie. It didn't have to be very funny to be such a good movie. The first wasn't even that funny, but I still enjoyed it. It's like, when they made the sequel, they thought it needs to be more funny than the first. Meet The Fockers is a funny movie but it just isn't like the first. It tried so hard to be hilarious, which it was.There was a problem I had with this movie. The rating. This is supposed to be a PG-13 movie, but it's so close for an R rating. Of course I'm allowed to see this movie, but what about the younger viewers. The film has brief nudity and some strong sexual humor. Thats why they tried to make it so funny, by adding so many sex related jokes. The original didn't have to do that and it became one of my favorite movies. I would recommend Meet The Fockers, because it made me laugh. (7.5/10)",7,0,1,2 July 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," You get what you expect
","In what may possibly be the final X-Men movie of the X-Men trilogy, a 'cure' for mutancy threatens to alter the course of history. For the first time, mutants have a choice, keep their uniqueness, though it makes them look different or give up their powers and become human. The same cast returns for this trilogy, which won't be the same if they don't. This is the most simple X-Men movie with a simple plot. It's pretty easy to explain to someone who doesn't know about this movie. I did like the first two a lot, but this movie probably in my opinion isn't the best but it delivers a lot of action. I remember reading something a while ago. It has to do with the sexy Halle Berry and if she wanted to do this movie or not. She said her role for 'Storm' had be bigger,better and sexier. She does have the second lead role in this film and it wouldn't be the same if she wasn't in it. This film wouldn't be the same if the whole cast wasn't in it.Since this may possibly be the last X-Men movie, many wondered if they will all die. This is what I thought, and they don't die. But some of the mutants did get cured including Rouge. Some of the mutants died, including Cyclops, I had no idea that he would die because I never read the comics and I don't remember the cartoons.One of the mutants who I thought should've been in this movie is Gambit. He's well known for his cards. I thought he was going to be in this movie since it was going to be the last one of the trilogy. But I feel that he could've been in this. Another mutant who joined the cast in this movie is The Beast. What I liked about it is that he doesn't fight in the beginning of the movie or in the middle but he does in the main fight at the end of the movie. Rebecca Romijn was looking sexy in this movie even playing Mystique, but in this movie she looses her powers and goes back to normal. I really did like this movie.This movie is action packed and this could be the most fun you'll have this summer. I'd watch this movie again for the fun of it. The cast was great, the movie was off the chain. I would give it a great 8.5/10",8,0,1,12 June 2006
Saw II," One hell of a movie!
","Saw 2 is the sequel to the surprise hit 'Saw'. Something occurred to me. I recently found out that the original 'Saw' had a 1 million dollar budget. I also read that it was about to be a straight-to-video/DVD release, but it got positive reviews, so it got released to theaters. Now if the first one was only released to DVD first, then I don't think there would've been a SAW 2. The only reason there is a sequel is because of how much money it made. I actually liked the first film. I also liked the second. It's a good horror sequel and it keeps getting intense by the minute.The film is basically about the sadistic killer 'Jigsaw'. A young detective is investigating the case of serial killer Jigsaw, who continues his deadly game on a new group of unlucky victims. The group is stuck in a booby trapped house. They have to play along with Jigsaw's rules and clues for survival. They are basically playing a game to keep their life.I'm not really sure if I liked the first more than the second. But I have to say that the first one had one hell of an ending and it was very shocking. But I felt that SAW 2 was one hell of a movie. With it's sick traps and bloody deaths. ******POSSIBLE SPOILERS****** What I really liked about this movie is towards the end of the movie, Amanda & the young boy entered the room were the two victims were in the first film. They were in the same exact room, and I felt that it was so awesome and brilliant.I also feel that audiences should see the first film before they see the second. The first might get spoiled, so thats my suggestion.Let me just say hat SAW 2 is one hell of a movie. Towards the end you will be in a ride. I give this movie a 7/10.",7,0,0,11 March 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A good movie for the whole family but isn't better than the 1971 classic.
","There were so many people who wanted the role for Willy Wonka. Marylin Manson was dying for the role and if he got it, I wouldn't even want to see it in theaters. It would be a movie to wait for the DVD. But Johnny Depp got the role and I was shocked when I heard about it. After I saw this movie, I knew that Johnny Depp will win an Acadamy Award for one of his movies.Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't only a remake of the 1971 classic 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' but it is based on the book. I loved the 1971 classic. It's one of the best movies ever made, and I know that for a fact. The thing I liked about this movie is that you go deeper into the movie. It shows you what happens to the characters after the factory and it just goes way into the story.Gene Wilder was a much better Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp was acting like a woman and reminded me of Michael Jackson. But when you think about it, Depp is a really good actor. The only character who I like more in the new version then the old one was Charlie played by Freddie Highmore. I liked him more than the old one. I liked all the old characters more than the new ones. There was just something I didn't like about the old Charlie.Charlie and the Chocolate Facotry was my second movie on my list as my 'Top 10 Summer Movies' and I finally saw it. I had a good time in watching this movie, and some parts are funny and you will put a smile on your face. 7.5/10",7,0,1,26 July 2005
Saw," Gripping, intense and a surprise ending
","Obsessed with teaching his victims a lesson of life, a sadistic serial killer is abducting people and forcing them to play horrific games for their own survival. Faced with impossible choices, each victim must struggle to win back his/her life, or else die trying. This movie is called 'Saw'. I don't know why, but this isn't the right title for this movie. It stars Cary Elwes Leigh Whannell, Danny Glover and Monica Potter. The killer calls himself 'Jigsaw'. He is obsessed with playing games with his victims. Sick games. The violence and the gore in this movie is so disgusting, it's fun to watch.Saw is a pretty intense piece of work. With a very low budget, it turns out to be a surprise scare. A few scenes are bone chilling, especially the last 10 to 15 minute's of the film. Towards the end of the movie, it becomes gripping. It becomes an edge of your seat horror movie. I thought the movie may have some ups and downs, but I am recommending it. I feel that this is a good movie for a low budget. I give this movie a 7/10.",7,0,1,6 March 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Action,Comedy, Suspense..... It's everything you want in a movie. Jolie and Pitt did great working together on this film.
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith is one of the biggest movies of the summer of 2005. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were everywhere. From the news to uh... the news. Some say this was the reason Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston broke up. But guess what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna review this movie.Mr. and Mrs. Smith is a great action packed movie. It's a fun film to watch if you certainly have nothing to do. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie did great working together. I don't know if the movie was gonna be the same if Nicole Kidman was casted as Mrs. Smith. Because she was. Then when she dropped out to work on The Interpreter, Angelina came to the project. The movie probably wouldn't have been the same. There was just something about Angelina Jolie in this movie.This is a very fun movie. There's comedy,action and suspense. It basically has everything you would want in a movie. It's one of those movies when you have to watch it. (8/10)",8,1,3,27 June 2005
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds is the best movie of the summer
","The summer's biggest blockbuster is already here. I couldn't wait to see War of the Worlds. It was my number one movie to watch in the year 2005. When you have a movie that Steven Spielberg is directing, you know its going to be a terrific movie. I loved all the Jurrassic Park movies, although Spielberg didn't direct the third one, it was still good.There were no boring scenes in War of the Worlds. Everything is pure fun and it is a wild ride. If only there were more jump scenes. I thought there would be some scenes in which an alien would pop out of no where, but that doesn't matter.Signs, directed by M. Night Shyamalan, is a brilliant alien movie. It was dark and in my opinion, the scariest movie I have ever seen. If only War of the Worlds would have you scared and shaking. But a movie with disaster like this, I don't think you can expect that. There was only one scene that made me jump. I think there were two jump scenes, but only one made me.The performances were outstanding. I love Dakota Fanning. I mean, who doesn't? She's so good in all of her movies and she keeps getting better and better. She can act better than some A list female actresses. Tom Cruise also did good. But he always seems to be smiling when there's something serious going on. Maybe thats just his face.There was a problem with the ending. During the movie, Ray (Cruise) looses his teenage son. He kept thinking he will never see him again, but when the battle was over, he went to his wife's house and to know they were all safe, including his son. It should have been better if they all died and Ray and his daughter (Fanning) survived. The only ones that survived. But the ending doesn't ruin the movie. It's a must see!War of the Worlds is exciting and a wild ride that would have you on the edge of your seat. If you want a movie with great acting in it and with outstanding special effects, then you should definitely see War of the Worlds. It's one of the best movies of the year. (9/10)",9,1,4,3 July 2005
Hitch," Not 'laugh out loud comedy', but it's enjoyable. Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Keven James are great in this movie.
","Hitch, to some people might be the funniest movie of the season. Some might think it isn't. There were scenes that were kind of hilarious. Kevin James did a great job playing a secondary role. Eva Mendes is gorgeous. Will Smith is always funny in his movies, not matter what. Even if it is action. Will Smith needs to do more movies like this, romantic comedies. I thought he did a good job in 'Hitch'.In romantic comedy, Alex 'Hitch' Hitchens (Smith) is New York City 'date doctor' who has helped men to try and get the women of their dreams. While coaching Albert (James), a meek accountant who likes a celebrity (Valletta), Hitch finally meets his match in the person of the gorgeous, whip-smart Sara (Mendes), a gossip columnist who is on to him.Hitch is probably the best romantic comedy of the year. But if your expecting to be laughing you a$$ off, don't expect that. But overall, I enjoyed it. 7.5/10",7,3,3,19 June 2005
Ray," Brilliant movie with a brilliant performance
","Ray is one of the best movies of 2004 and possibly the best I have ever seen. There were so many emotional scenes that are too sad to see. The music is outstanding that is played throughout the movie. Jamie Foxx deserved to be in this movie. There probably couldn't have been another choice to play Ray Charles other than Jamie Foxx. Ray couldn't have been made without Jamie Foxx being in it. Ray is a movie that can be compared to a painting by Picasso. Ray is excellent. The music is excellent. Jamie Foxx is excellent.There might be people who might get bored from this movie because it is 2 hours and a half. But it needs to be long, so everything can be explained. The scene when Ray's brother George drowns in one scene is just bizarre. Also when his mother finds out and she bursts into tears, its just emotional. Absolutely no one should hate this movie for any reason. I don't like watching scenes like that. Scenes that can be disturbing to some viewers. Also when Ray keeps thinking back because he didn't do anything as he watched his brother drown. He feels really guilty. There's nothing more I can say about this film. It's incredible and powerful.",10,3,5,7 June 2005
Fantastic Four," Fun and Entertaining
","Fantastic 4 did a good job casting. It was better the movie had actors that not many people know about. Jessica Alba did a good job as the Invisible Woman.Of course anyone would be scared if they can light themselves on fire or they can stretch any part of their body. Also when Sue Storm (Alba) can turn invisible. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) thinks he can get himself famous because of his powers, and he seems to be comfortable with the way he is. Like 2002's Spider-Man, when Peter gets bit by a spider, the nest day he is swinging all over the city and not even scared, or he doesn't even get checked by a doctor. But in Fantastic 4, three of the characters were nervous about their symptoms.There are a bit of goofs in the movie. Like when Johnny Storm is skiing with a nurse, he then gets on fire and she doesn't even do anything about it. There were more goofs but none of them ruined my time watching it. I may have to say that Fantastic 4 has no plot, and I understand. It has no real plot, but what matters is if you aren't bored in the theater.I had a fun time watching Fantastic 4. Out of all the big summer movies in 2005, Fantasitc 4 is one of the movies you'll have the most fun in. There's a lot of action and comedy to keep you awake. This movie was getting horrible reviews by critics, but whoever listens to critics? You can agree with them but not listen. Some people don't go see a movie because it got bad reviews. Well don't listen to them. I'm saying you should go see this movie, if your a young adult and a teenager, you would like this movie and you will have fun. 8/10.",7,0,1,26 July 2005
The Island," A great action packed film
","Let me start off by saying that this is a hard movie to explain. If I want to give the summary for this movie, it could possibly spoil the movie. Therefore it's better to just see the movie,not knowing what it's about. This movie stars Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. This is also a bit confusing for me to explain what the movie is exactly about.Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) is a person living in a seemingly but weird in a contained facility in the mid-21st century. Like all the people of this carefully constructed environment, Lincoln hopes to be chosen to go to 'The Island,' reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the plant, until he makes a terrible discovery that everything about his existence is a lie. He then informs Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) the truth about 'The Island'.The thing that I don't really understand is why this movie bombed at the box office. It cost nearly 122 million to make and earned 25 million in the US. I don't understand why people missed out on this movie. It seemed like a big summer blockbuster and people missed out on it. To me, the cast was quite okay. The thing is, people probably didn't understand the story, and what it's exactly about.This movie is an intense ride and a great action packed film. I enjoyed it and you won't get bored. This movie will keep you awake and on the edge of your seat. Scarlett Johansson is really hot in this movie and I'm sure in her others. I recommend that people watch this. 7.5/10",7,0,0,2 April 2006
