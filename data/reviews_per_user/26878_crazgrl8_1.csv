Mission: Impossible III," Excellent, Edge of your seat!
","I highly recommend this movie! At first I was skeptical...after all...most '3-quals' just dive bomb and do not even compare to the first 2...however MI3 is awesome! If you can believe it, its better than the first two! Two hours of edge of your seat, heart pounding action! One minute you are calm, the next you are wanting to jump in and help, the next you are nearly in tears, then laughing, then on the edge of your seat again! Nice twist in the plot as well! A lot of murmuring and snide remarks about Tom Cruise lately but his acting is still strong and still convincing! I was impressed with all of the actors in this movie! They were all very convincing and awesome! I especially loved Keri Russell! As you may well know (since she hasn't excelled in the big screen) she doesn't have a huge part but what she is in is very convincing and very dramatic! I was impressed to see that she did such a great job in this action-packed drama! Hope to see her in more similar roles! All in all this movie is a must see!!!!",Null,0,1,8 May 2006
