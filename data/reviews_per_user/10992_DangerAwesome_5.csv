Captain Phillips," Everything I hoped for
","'Captain Phillips' is an exciting story of piracy. Its highlights include great acting by both principal actors (Hanks and Abdi), an incredibly intense showdown between two boats, and a strong ending.The scene depicted in the trailers, with the skiff boarding the freighter, is one of the best individual scenes of 2013. It ratchets the intensity to such a high degree that it is somewhat disappointing that that scene is so early in the movie. Because everything after it seems slow paced by comparison.Great exchanges between the two main actors. Tom Hanks was his typical greatness, even though this role was probably not juicy enough for an Oscar. Barkhad Abdi, despite never acting before, was also stellar. He looked and sounded the part perfectly.The film lags a bit after the pirates take the captain hostage. That section of the film could probably be trimmed by 5 or 10 minutes without losing much. When watching it I became afraid that the one great scene from before would be the only highlight. I was proved wrong by the strong ending. I don't want to give away too much, but the last 10 minutes or so are the other highlight.Pacing issues in the middle of the movie (the hostage part) is the only issue I have with Captain Phillips. It was an intense story of piracy. Every movie has a few parts that it needs to get right in order to be a good movie, and Captain Phillps gets a 10/10 for those parts. Its only issues are in the other, less significant, parts. I strongly recommend this film.",8,6,11,13 October 2013
Gravity," A+ for effort, execution, and enjoyability
","'Gravity' does things with the sound and cinematography that other movies only dream of doing. Frequently filming from the first person, the film attempts to put you in the place of an astronaut adrift in space. It succeeds in a big way. Be prepared to be on the edge of your seat for 90 minutes.The cinematography of this film is visionary. There is never an 'up' or 'down' to limit the camera. A common camera trick is to show the camera at a crooked angle to show uneasiness. Every shot in Gravity is at a crooked angle because there's never a clear up or down. That use of cinematography is brilliant in depicting the overall uneasiness of the entire movie.The use of sound is nothing short of masterful. The silence makes you lean in close, then the occasional noise makes you lean back. Watching a space station be torn to shreds without sound makes you appreciate with your eyes. Then spending so much time listening to breathing makes you focus on your own breathing. It evokes a sense in yourself that few movies ever reach.My only complaint about the movie, and I will say this is a fairly minor complaint, is that Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) basically has a 90 minute panic attack. She never calms down. I know that we are supposed to feel what she feels, and for the most part we do, but personally I doubt that adrenaline would last so long in myself.There's not much to say in words about this movie. It's visual. It's noise. It's the lack of noise. It's brilliant. Go watch it.",9,4,6,14 October 2013
Rush," Respect
","'Rush' is a formulaic piece that excels in almost every way other than its predictability. It's well acted, well filmed, and has great music to boot. If it wins an Oscar for something I'd expect it for the music first, then perhaps an acting nomination to Daniel Brühl (Niki Lauda) second.You do not need to be a formula 1 racing fan to enjoy this movie. I have never watched an F1 race in my life, nor even seen an F1 movie before this one. What makes the movie interesting is not the sport, but the main characters and their relationship with each other.It's a brilliantly acted rivalry between Niki Lauda (Brühl) and James Hunt (Hemsworth). Both turn in A+ performances. By far the best performance I've yet seen from Hemsworth. He proved to me, with this movie, that he's more than just an action star. However he is outshone by Brühl. The film succeeds in showing both the tough exterior and the still tough but different inside personality of Lauda. That's a major accomplishment for both the director and the actor.What makes Rush worth watching isn't the suspense of what is going to happen next. It's perhaps one of the most formulaic sports movies I've ever seen. It succeeds in spite of that. It's the depiction of the main characters, their rude exchanges, and their underlying respect for each other, that makes it worth the 2 hours.",7,1,2,13 October 2013
Prisoners," Good, but somewhat disappointing
","'Prisoners' is essentially a remake of Mystic River (2003). It's a good mystery that uses great imagery. And despite the massive runtime, it doesn't lag too badly.I wanted to love Hugh Jackman's performance as the father, but he basically has 2 emotions in the entire film. Angry, sad, then angry again. Not that he doesn't do those two emotions well, but it's not enough. Gyllenhaal is fine as the detective, and I was pleasantly surprised by Terrence Howard as Franklin. For a movie that seemed ideal for great acting roles, the portrayals are only decent to good.The best part of the movie are the twists and turns of the mystery and how it is revealed and comes together. The imagery of the maze is an interesting motif and is used very well. I am honestly a little upset with the movie for how neatly it is all explained by the end. There is no room for ambiguity. The movie does a good job keeping us in the dark and guessing for at least 2 hours of its 2 hour 30 minute runtime. I wish it had ended with at least a little of the mystery that made it worth watching.Had I never seen Mystic River (2003) I probably would have liked Prisoners a little more. It's a good mystery, but I was a little let down by the acting and a little let down by the ending. Good movie, I'd recommend it, but I'd actually recommend Mystic River more.",7,0,1,13 October 2013
Monsters University," Surprisingly solid comedy
","'Monsters University' has a thin plot that lends itself perfectly for comedy. It's basically 'Rudy' but with becoming a professional scarer instead of being a Notre Dame football player. Except unlike Rudy, we know from the very beginning that he's going to fail. The good news is that this is a comedy, not an inspiring feel good story of how if you work hard enough you can achieve your dream. And as a comedy Monsters University delivers consistent laughs.Most of the jokes are visual so it's tough to rehash them in a written review. 'I found a nickle! Sure wish I had pockets...' What keeps this movie going isn't witty dialogue as much as it is lots of little visual extras in the background of different shots. It's the detail that makes it good.If you don't like visual humor then Monsters University is probably not for you. It offers little else. It's not much in the way of a plot. If you think about the moral of the story, it's that no matter how hard you work you may never achieve your goals. Perhaps it teaches kids a good lesson on mediocrity and being okay with not being the best. Somehow it sounds less inspiring than the movie makes it out to be.If you enjoy other Pixar movies or enjoyed Monsters Inc. then Monsters University is definitely worth a watch. It won't go down as a classic, but it's still a very solid comedy.",7,0,0,9 October 2013
