Come and See," Extremely Impacting
","The character change seen in this film, would be exactly how I would imagine a child would be after experiencing such a time in WWII. The child in the film is once seen as excited and thrilled by the idea of war, but immediately is thrown into a sickening, confusing and horrific world where there is no other option but survival. The imagery in this film is incredible. The impact it had on me while I watched this film nearly made me sick. It was brutal to watch but I was very thankful for that, no one wants to see the war sugar coated. The soundtrack was equally as impacting as it complimented what was going on on screen perfectly. The actor playing Florya did an incredible job at growing with the story as the boy did look about 25 years older in the last scene in the film. Absolutely brilliant.",8,1,1,14 December 2010
