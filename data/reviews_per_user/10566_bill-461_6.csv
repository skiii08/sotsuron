The Blair Witch Project," I hate to generalize, but...
","BWP is the acid test. I've found that my students who liked itare generally kids who use their imaginations in writing,projects and expressing themselves. The students who didn't are generally looking for something more along thelines of Scream. Sorry to put it so bluntly, but if you didn'tfind BWP scary, you probably didn't take your friend Mr.Imagination along with you to the theatre.",8,0,1,22 August 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," Decent
","This wasn't a  total waste of time. I got through the whole thing, butmostly because I think Renee Zellweger is quirky and sometimestouching as an actress. And I think some of her scenes with HughGrant were sort of funny. The light tone kept me from wanting togag as I did the night before when I tried to watch Crazy Beautiful.At least this movie doesn't try to take itself too seriously. I can't, however--understand how Jim Broadbent won an Oscar forhis role--unless I'm remembering wrong and he won for MoulinRouge--He has been twenty times better than this in movies likeLife is Sweet. He can do stuff like this in his sleep and it's just notmuch of a role.",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Dream!
","First off, I've only sat through about 10 martial arts films in my life. Iabsolutely cannot stand them. When people talk about them, I findmyself wanting to burst their balloons and say something like,'Yeah, they remind me a lot of pro wrestling.' But if you feel the way that I do about martial arts movies---andallow that to keep you from seeing this movie, you are really losingout. I loved everything about this movie and I found nothing toquibble about. -Dimensional, well crafted characters portrayed by 'real' actorswho could mop the floor with most of Hollywood's acting talent andI'm talking about their acting ability, not flying spin kicks.-The effects were perfectly balanced with character and place andthe story never took a back seat to the wire dancing stuff. -The little actress who played Jen has more acting talent in her leftfoot than the  combined casts of Charlies Angels, Dude, Where'sMy Car and Vertical Limit. Wait and see, some brilliant Hollywooddirector will bring her to LA and cast her as the love interest inMASH 2---  Go see this. Take kids. Take your parents. It proves once again,what the best filmakers and playwrights have been trying to tell usforever. It's all about story.",10,0,0,27 December 2000
Mulholland Drive," This film makes people who need plot--really angry....
","and they start throwing around phrases like 'pretentious crap.' and 'Jackson Pollock bulls&^%' and accuse David Lynch of being the Emperor walking down the street with no clothes on. All I know is that I love a movie that is crafted in the 'well made play' mode and has easy to follow plot lines.----Sometimes. But not all the time. And thank God there are brave directors like David Lynch--Robert Altman  and a few others who know that there are many ways to tell a story and to tell it well. This is a beautiful, scary, frustrating, funny and sexy movie. I think I understand it, but who cares anyway? I kept me totally involved for two and a half hours and I kept praying for it not to end before I could decipher a little more. I give it a 9. Probably my favorite David Lynch film. I can't wait to watch it again.",9,1,2,27 May 2002
Any Given Sunday," Even the title isn't very well thought out....
","Okay, how about that one Sunday in April of '03? This is an 'Emperor's New Clothes,' type of movie. It has enough hard hitting sequences and tough gritty dialog that sometimes it's hard for people to look past the supposed 'coolness,' and say---'ummm it's just not a very good film.' All style (and pretty phony style at that) and no substance. I like the scene where Pacino almost buys the zillion dollar hooker, though. Let's face it. There has simply NEVER been a realistic or good film about football. The best story ever was North Dallas Forty (terrible football sequences) and the most realistic looking football movie--practices and game situations was probably Rudy (annoying little guy who you almost had to root against). But this one is like an episode of Dallas on steroids. Oliver Stone is really in over his head sometimes and this is one of those times.",1,5,11,5 February 2006
Am√©lie," Here's a twin bill...
","I snuck into it after watching Monsters Ball. Both terrific movies butthe strangest double bill since I saw Ordinary People and TheElephant Man. Well, the evening cost me twenty bucks so Ideserved a freebie. I am as enchanted with Audrey Tatou as I was with AudreyHepburn in Roman Holiday. You can take all the --Angela Jolie'sand Pamela Andersons you can find--line them up naked onscreen and I would trade 'em all for a smile from this youngactress any day (not to mention that she could act the thongs off ofany of them.) What a wonderful film. I haven't heard people laughing in a theatrelike that in a long, long time. And not a cum in the hair, or dog poopjoke in the entire film.  Take a hint Hollyweird.",9,0,1,22 January 2002
