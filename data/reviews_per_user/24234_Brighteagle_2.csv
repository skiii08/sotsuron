Hereditary," Film to be desired
","There is much to say about this movie but if too much is said it will give away the brilliantly clever storyline. The storyline behind the movie is excellent with plot twists along the way which did not get discovered ill they happened. Milly Shapiro is one to look out for and much praise should be given to the young actress in the making. Tori Collette again as always delivers a fantastic tear jerking performance which I would say is one of her best performances to date. Alex Wolff exceeded my expectations of his acting, and was yet another talented star in the making. Yet, the film does not receive any higher stars due to its lack of horror and with a few jumps scared here and a few jump scares there it is more of a psychology thriller then when you finish the movie makes you think about certain concepts that may relate to you own life and opinions.",7,0,2,24 June 2018
Mulan," Mulan (inspiring, brillant, fantastic)
","I was wary at first when I first started watching Mulan as back in 1998 when the film was released, there was not much positively said towards women in society so I did not have much hope that this movie would be able to pull off such a powerful women lead back in a time when women were perceived to be lower down in class compared to men. However, this movie starts out to be one of the best female lead movies that I have watched in a long time. Going by the time in which the movie was made Pam Coats did an amazing job for producing the movie and Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft brilliantly directed the movie in a way to focus on Mulan's journey from a small maiden to a warrior of the army in China and receiving praise from the emperor. This film is a fantastic movie to show the power then women can hold and the equality that should be faced towards both men and women. This film is still relevant in todays society across the globe and could easier be names as one of the best Disney movies that have been created.",8,0,0,24 June 2018
