The Hangover," A fun,cliché-free spin
","I saw the movie twice.First time,I saw it alone and found it amusing but was kinda disappointed because I expected a much funnier film and I was annoyed with the weaker parts of the plot(I found the Chinese guy trying too hard to be funny and rather fake,in particular). Still,I was entertained.I think the music in the film is well chosen and no one can denie there is a lot of originality in this movie,not all those clichés that we are forced to see in comedy films this last couple of years.Recently,I saw the movie again.This time with my friends.I didn't remember it well so I realized I hadn't seen it carefully the first time. I laughed out loud a lot which I don't do that easily.Admittedly,the atmosphere was cheerful,having friends over.We had a lot of fun. This time I didn't notice the weaker parts in the movie and I didn't look for them.The movie is funny,it doesn't have a lot of lame or already seen jokes,it has a lot of unexpected events and I liked the characters-Bradley Cooper's bitter school teacher who still knows how to have fun,Ed Helms' henpecked Stu,Zach Galifianakis's Alan,weird and uncomfortable but funny(the actor had perfect timing) and Justin Bartha's Doug,a normal guy who actually got together the other 3 completely different guys.Heather Graham's Jane is also likable.If you want to see a good comedy,and you haven't seen the Hangover,rent it,get it,see it. If you look closely,you'll get more than just a comedy. If you just want to relax,get it again .This is one of those comedies that people will see in 10 years each time it's on.The next Weekend at Bernie's,a surprising summer hit we always tune in to watch,but the Hangover is deeper and more hilarious(imo :D)So just watch it.Forget about the hype,the critics,the good and the bad reviews.The movie is original enough to give it the benefit of the doubt. Forget your expectations and prejudices and just watch it. It will be worth it.",9,2,4,6 April 2010
