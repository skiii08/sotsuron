Requiem for a Dream," on reading some negative comments.........
","after reading a couple of the comments on this film, which i saw for the second time last night, i must say some stuff.  kids, its the responsibility or art and of the artist (that includes filmmakers) to talk about EVERY aspect of life.  sometimes it doesn't always turn out nice in the end, which i think is one of the opening lines of the movie.  this is true.  i can't seem to make people understand that if the director intends to produce a feeling, and then succeeds, then the result is good.  quills is another example of this. you are SUPPOSED to feel disgusted/depressed/hopeless etc. it's only a movie.  at the same time one may argue that they go to the movies to feel good.  well, this is one guy's opinion, but i say go get a massage.  i go to the movies to be captivated. also, any movie which makes the audience think twice about going to the movies in the first place is a huge success in my book.  movies, films, thus art are not about having a good time, and then going home to forget about it.  movies can talk about the good times, but they also have to talk about the bad.  you dont like it, dont see it.  hopefully you'll see it accidently and then think twice before you pay for your next movie ticket. wonderful film.-c",Null,2,3,10 January 2001
