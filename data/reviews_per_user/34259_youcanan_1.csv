Changeling," I'm not on a mission i just want my son
","Angelinas character is brain dead in this movie. Completely unimpassioned in the face of the people who are obviously screwing her. She is weak, submissive, apologetic even, it makes you want to slap her. There's an overwhelming amount of evidence on her side and her character is completely unable to express it in a stern dominant manner. She can't stand her ground for shite.. This is not the characteristic of a loving caring mother in the face of folks keeping her away from her child. Fight bitch! It's your daym son. Get motivated, prove it with force empowerment.
