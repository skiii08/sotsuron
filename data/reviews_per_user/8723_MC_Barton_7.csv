Casablanca," 'Everybody Comes to Rick's'
","Casablanca is one of the most famous film titles, even by those who have never watched the movie. The plot is intriguing, set off of the coast of a Nazi-controlled Europe. Humphrey Bogart really nails his role as an 'American,' the man whom everybody looks up to for his capacity to seemingly solve problems (hint-hint). Where the movie really shined was in it's camera work, the shots, angles, and lighting were fantastic. My personal interest was fixated on the development of Rick himself, the transformation he undergoes is absolutely romantic in human nature. The final scene is what really did me in, in a good way, of course. His trials and tribulations teach a very interesting perspective on the human condition.",8,0,2,11 March 2015
Taxi Driver," 'There's no escape. I'm God's only man.'
","'Taxi Driver' is not considered one of the greatest movies ever made for no reason. There are so many things that bear significance within the movie for the time, and even for now. The film takes place right after the Vietnam War, when the effects of the war was still prevalent among the community. Violence is a fixated them within the film, however it isn't unwarranted. The violence that Travis engages in is oddly judicial, acting as a vigilante he contends with the gripes of a corrupted society. The film sends a subliminal message, that violence and corruption have become an issue within our country. During the time this was no shocking revelation, but an apparent one. Citizens had lost trust for the government after being lied to countless times about information regarding the countries involvement in Vietnam, so it was up to the individual to do what was right essentially. There is one interesting scene in particular, at the end where a woman hails Travis as a hero and he politely denies and exempts her payment. Showing the importance of communication between a society and its members.",9,0,2,22 April 2015
Annie Hall," 'It's all mental masturbation.'
","'Annie Hall' is one of those movies you either like or don't like. Woody Allen depicts his love for movies and his innovativeness, especially while engaging the audience by breaking the forth wall in clever segments. I have never watched a movie directed by Woody Allen, at least as far as I can remember. However I remember hearing amongst the students in my Cinema class that they either loved or hated Woody Allen. I thought 'well, it can't be that extreme,' but it sort of has a truth to it. The movie made me laugh, other times it just seemed that the humor was being forcefully pushed upon me. Some of the content is clever and thought provoking. Not to say it is a bad movie, because it definitely is not, it is an alright movie. It's charm wore down for me within the first 40 minutes or so and just felt like it was doing whatever it could to drag itself along to meet a specific standard of time most movies abide by these days.",6,0,2,27 April 2015
The Graduate," 'Have you thought about graduate school?'
","'The Graduate,' to me is a landmark movie. There are so many things that the film does correctly, not just technically but contextually. For starters, the movie seemingly connects the generation gap by a wobbly bridge over troubled waters by introducing sexual relations between a teenager entering his adult years and a fully grown woman with an established life. From this aesthetic quality arose many quarrels during the duration of the plot, which were always filled with tension, and I mean always, even at seemingly calm segments. This, I felt and became anxious as to what was to happen next. Technically, I have never seen a movie of such grace. The unique camera angles and panning techniques utilized really offered many differing perspectives which allowed me to perceive the situations in different lights. My favorite though are the cutting techniques, specifically when facial close-ups occur and then the camera pans out to reveal that the entire setting has changed, and this all happened smoothly. Also the scene where Ben propels himself out of the water onto the raft in the pool only to cut to a scene of himself landing on top of Mrs. Robinson is great.",8,0,0,22 April 2015
Singin' in the Rain," 'A triple threat'
","'Singin' in the Rain' is just that, a musical about overcoming a storm of problems and serves as a great reboot of the musical genre of films. Even if you aren't a fan of these types of movies it is still possible to gather entertainment from this quirky flick. The songs aren't particularly memorable in any sense, besides for maybe two of them, 'Good Morning' and 'Singin' in the Rain,' (of course). While it does nothing different from musicals in our generation of films, it was underrated at the time of its release and harbored an aspect that similar musicals had lacked, a plot! Oh yes, a plot to glue everything together, while collective yet overdone, it operated efficiently and did its job of keeping the audiences attention. Looking back upon this movie retrospectively, it might be labeled as a classic, but it is nothing special.",5,0,1,30 March 2015
Pulp Fiction," 'That's thirty minutes away, I'll be there in ten.'
","Tarantino delivers a masterpiece with 'Pulp Fiction.' The master of quick- witted dialog doesn't fail to deliver, there is never a moment of boredom within the film. Watching through it just once, it is impossible to understand and grasp just how many references and criticisms there are to and about pop culture. The movie is highly stylized and distinctly carries it's own identity, and I'm not going to give away any plot points because this is a must watch, so I'll be as vague as possible. The movie seemingly has no linear plot structure since it jumps around a lot, and that is an understatement. With that being said, it just is impossible to lose attention from the viewer, but it is possible to get lost in the content, which is why it is more than deserving of multiple watch- throughs.",9,0,1,27 April 2015
Psycho," 'A boy's best friend is his mother'
","'Psycho' is a masterpiece in all sense of the meaning. It has the two aspects that makes for a riveting adventure into an alternate reality of horror, both aesthetic and apparent qualities. Horror movies are a major component of societal culture and are often executed with the objective of just frightening the viewer with predictable methods such as jump scares or disgusting content. However, once in a while, comes along a psychological horror film that is able to rattle the sense of being and challenge the moral compass of an individual, and 'Psycho' is one of those films. Needless to say the real fear elicited from the film is that fact that a monster resides in such a normal, compassionate, and kind Norman Bates. Hiding his true intentions, he turns into one of the most provocative killers ever portrayed in any movie and has become a cultural icon. The shower scene in particular needs mentioning, the killing out of context doesn't really have an impact, but taking into account that the protagonist has just been killed about halfway through the movie gives a sense of vulnerability and is truly a shock that is worth noting. If you haven't seen this film, watch it.",9,1,2,30 March 2015
