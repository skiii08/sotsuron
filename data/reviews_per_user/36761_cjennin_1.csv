Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great movie tarnished by cry-babies & spoilt brats
","As a movie watcher & Star Wars fan, it upsets me that this great file has been trashed by film critics & over-opinionated cry-babies that illy call themselves Star Wars fans. I reckon most of the complainers who seen TPM are spoilt on the other Star Wars films (I have nothing against Eps 4,5 & 6) & are not ready to see things differently compared to the other films or they take SW fan-fiction to seriously, too seriously to accept Lucas's vision of Star Wars.1, Jar Jar Binks,I don't find Jar Jar annoying, he's just a piece of computer code, he's not real & I've seen more annoying people in real life. (anti-Jar Jar people for starters) He's there for comedy relief because the other comedy relief characters for the past SW films (the droids, Chowie, eg) worn't even born, didn't appear or played short roles in TPM.2, Anakin Skywalker, It's so easy to bash a child actor & I do admit that he was not what I expected but I don't mind him, I wasn't expecting Anny to be an insecure, emotionally unstable kid like Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis Evangelion.3, The Story Line, Anakin had to come from somewhere, Obiwan needed some past adventures, the Jedi order, the Sith & the Republic had to be explained without imperial censorship & Jar Jar needed a purpose... And the storyline of TPM does all that that & more, the script isn't perfect but  do keep in mind that Lucas hasn't directed a Sci-fi movie for years so do expect him to be a bit rusty. If Lucas caved in & removed Jar Jar, how would Jin & Kanobi reach the Queen, odds are they would wonder around the swamp without a clue where to go & get killed by hundreds of Trade Federation droids & Lucas has to rewrite the other films to condensed the fact that Anakin was not 'discovered'.4, So-called 'racism', So what if Jar Jar sounds like an African-American & the Trade Faderation sounds like WW2 era Asians at war with the US, Star Wars is mostly for kids so do expect stereotypical accents, anyone one knows that Lucas isn't trying to offend any ethnic groups.Star Wars is a sci-fi, not a company there you own shares in it & can tell CEO Lucas who to run it, it's Lucas's movie, not yours, if he want's to add humanoid frogs with an attitude then he can, if he want's Anakin to act to childish for his age then more power to him, I like TPM the way it is, changing it just to satisfy a minority would destroy the film!So if your a Sci-Fi fan, a Star Wars fan or there's nothing on TV, give TPM a chance, ignore those anti-Jar Jar jerks, these guy's just don't appreciate anything.",Null,1,3,5 June 2002
