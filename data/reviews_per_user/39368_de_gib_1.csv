Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Cultural Differences
","'Jagshemash!' I gave this a 9 because of the scene at the hotel. Otherwise, it's pretty funny.Sacha Baron Cohen is pretty funny as Borat, and it's easy to see why this movie is gaining a lot of controversy. However, I, along with the rest of the crowd loved his performance. My favorite scene (spoiler) is when the kids run up to the ice cream truck and get scared off by the bear (end of spoilers).I found Borat's cultural differences and jokes as somehow offensive, but still downright funny. For a movie that had the #1 spot at the box office, it deserves such a profit.So I recommend this movie, if you aren't easily offended, because odds are you will be offended by at least one scene. An easy vote for the funniest movie of the year.",9,1,7,11 November 2006
