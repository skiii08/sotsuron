Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I liked it
","Hey, man, I enjoyed this movie.  I seem to be in the minority here, but I have really no beefs with it.  After all, it IS George Lucas' story, not everyone else's.  The story is what it is.  I even found myself chuckling at Jar Jar at times.  Good special effects, established a storyline, good drama with the duel with darth maul, loved the pod races, and comic relief. Anyways, I don't have time to write a novel, so there's my 2 cents.",Null,0,1,15 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," excellent
","It was definitely different than any of the others, for certain, but still I enjoyed it very much.  Cool new creatures, battle sequences, FX, and a twisting plot kept me interested throughout.  I don't want to spoil, so I'll just say that it is very amusing from start to finish, very much keeping in line with the previous Star Wars installments...have fun with this one.",6,0,0,3 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," My favorite of the 3 movies
","I have to say that without a doubt, this movie is my personal favorite of the 3 movies in the trilogy.  Why?  I love the tension and overall sense of gloom the actors, and more noteably, the score portray for us.  Rohan seems like it would normally be a beautiful, bright, happy place, but a dark shadow has fallen over it.  Very well done in this sense.  Sometimes, it is just dreadfully quiet as the actors deliver their lines with just a hint of music in the background.  When Eomer delivers the line....'Do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands.' it still gives me goose bumps.  Same with Theoden as he conveys his sense of being alone in this fight at Helm's Deep to Aragorn...'Yes, my Lord Aragorn, we ARE alone.' Awesome....Some other awesome things I loved about this movie:-Gimli is hilarious...him and Legolas also interact well -The Uruks are just some bad mothers...I love them and hate them -The Battle of Helm's Deep is so tense and nervy...not to mention great action -Boromir flashback by Faramir was incredible, and necessary -Gollum......enough said -PO-TA-TOES!!!  I love that scene...still cracks me up. -The Nazgul on the fell beasts are scary! -The dead marshes totally creep me out...well done -The Ents attacking Isengard was one of the coolest things to watch-Even though totally fabricated...I love the warg scene -Every scene in Rohan was great, I can't say enough about the score and awesome actng by Theoden, Eomer, Aragorn, and Gandalf -LOVE the cliff hanger ending and the closing credits music -The EE adds SO MUCH to this movie...every extra scene works for me -this movie has GREAT comic relief (Eowyn's stew comes to mind, and everything out of Gimli's mouth)I think I'll watch it again tonight",10,2,3,9 January 2004
