Child 44," Despite Great Performances and Noomi Rapace, Confusing and Hard to Watch
","I was so excited to see this title because of the great cast and Noomi! More Noomi!Yet, despite all in its favor, I found this film unbelievably formulaic when it wasn't confusing. Also, it was overly violent. I don't mind violence, but the fight scenes were poorly edited and lame.Finally! the cast decided there was a serial killer and it became a procedural on TNT.But Noomi was great, so was Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman. Joel Kinnaman, who I like very much from TV and movies, had a difficult, two-dimensional role that was written badly. Ugh. I can't recommend this film.",4,1,2,9 October 2016
Don Jon," Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful
","I have loved JGL from my first view of him on Third Rock From the Sun. 'This planet both sucks and blows!' Then, I caught 'Mysterious Skin' which was amazing but I won't recommend because it's a difficult film to watch. He made the lightweight 500 Days which I enjoyed. He was in a few blockbusters and I enjoyed seeing him in every one.But then he did 50/50 which I loved. And now Don Jon which I will watch several times to witness the character development and the changes that each goes through. I can't say enough about the performances of Julianne Moore. And Brie Larson! Love her from United States of Tara. The entire cast was pitch perfect. You will enjoy it.",9,0,0,30 May 2014
Molly's Game," If you Like Jessica Chastain Please see her in Jolene
","I watched Molly's Game and found it amazing, fascinating, moving and terrifying. The screenplay and direction by Sorkin and Ms. Chastain's brilliant performance make this a smart, heartfelt movie.I am certain that the original Ms. Bloom is also brilliant. See this film!",10,3,5,15 January 2019
Alice in Wonderland," Is She the RIGHT Alice?
","Linda Woolverton and Tim Burton have taken a short, strange poem - which I love - and made it into an extravaganza of visual beauty and excitement.I love this film. Yeah, maybe it has very little to do with the original poem --- forget about all that and let yourself be taken on a joy ride through Wonderland, or Underland as the locals call it.Mia W. is fabulous as an independent creative girl who doesn't want to marry nobility. When she falls into the hole (as we all know she does) she makes her own way. Helena Bonham Carter - wonderful as always - as the Red Queen is also so much fun! Forget your expectations and ENJOY!",10,1,3,24 October 2015
La La Land," I Actually Watch Old Movies ALL THE TIME
","I heard that this movie reminded people of old movies which led to a slew of good reviews.I LOVE Emma Stone and I LOVE Ryan Gosling. I thought that they were wonderful together in Crazy Stupid Love. And I admit to liking a lot of weird and strange movies. Right now, my favorite movie is Mr. Right with Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell (See it! So fun!).I watch old movies all the time. This did not remind me of an old movie. It had a lot of singing in it. By non-singers.I tried to watch this. I did. I couldn't get past the first twenty minutes. I was BORED! Then, in hopes that it might generate some interest for me, I watched the last 45 minutes. Still, MEH. I don't care about these characters and I found that the songs distanced me from them. They didn't seem 'real' but rather, were like caricatures of real people. The last five minutes was really pretty to watch. But still - did not care!So, if you're wondering what all the hype was about and can't figure it out... you're not alone.",4,4,6,21 September 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise is having a very weird day
","Tom Cruise is having a very bad day in this movie mashup of Alien and Groundhog Day. Wearing a very fancy suit, Cruise's character takes Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, survives his first battle and meets the girl in the first ten minutes. Now he just needs to save the planet.I love this film. It's crazy and wacky and I honestly do not know how they do it, but it gets done.I love that nothing is repeated like you'd expect and nothing happens like you think it will. Enjoy!",8,0,0,1 December 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Costume Dramas and this one is GREAT!
","Sweet film about a writer, a story and a WWII story about the island of Guernsey. Well cast, well paced and beautifully written. I hope you'll check this out and enjoy the love that magically occurs when you're in the right place at the right time.Lily James is always a delight (loved her in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies) and the rest of the cast were equally wonderful. I love when the costumes and production values are as high as they were for this movie.Enjoy!",9,0,1,17 August 2018
Prometheus," Gorgeous Special Effects and Make Up
","I didn't realize this was a prequel when I saw it. I thought Scott did a great job. The special effects and make up are amazing, the plot and pacing work really well and I really want to know what happens next! Noomi is intense and wonderful, as always. I loved all her scenes.I read a review of this movie where the writer slammed this movie. I don't think that writer was paying attention. For example, David was studying ancient languages for years in order to improve his chances of communicating with an alien race. This was mentioned in the film.The 'Engineers' were amazingly beautiful. I noticed that one of the actors playing an Engineer is also playing 'The Mountain' on 'Game of Thrones.' They were so cool.",7,2,4,3 October 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," What the Heck?
","The first half hour was great. I was so impressed and could not believe that the same director had also done the sequel. After the first half hour, there's some weird dream stuff and stuff that isn't dream stuff and I went 'Huh?'.What there wasn't - all that yak, yak, yakking from the first film. I got so sick of that General Zod guy yakking.So - no yakking. Yay.Affleck was great as Bruce Wayne. And I love Cavill as superman. I liked him as Napoleon Solo, too. He's good, he's yummy. They were fine. It's just the decisions that were made for this script, this story, this whole one versus the other thing. It just got silly. Oh, and throw in the Wonder Woman intro with some crazy backstory for her. Can't forget to toss that in like this is the action movie stew of the century!Why is this director still working for DC Comics? I'm blaming all the bad decisions on him. Even if it's not his fault.",5,2,6,26 November 2016
The Truman Show," Just Watched This Again After All These Years
","Wow, what a movie! I love this movie today even more than I did the first time. It hasn't lost anything as time has passed.I recall watching Hitchcock's Vertigo with a movie audience several years ago and when Jimmy Stewart explains to Kim Novak how he wants her to dress and wear her hair he ends with this justification, 'It can't possibly matter to you!' The entire audience burst out laughing.This movie is as fresh and modern as it was in 1999 (not as old as Vertigo, I know). I love the reactions of those watching the show - how invested they are and how much they all love Truman. And Jim Carey is wonderful. Ed Harris, too, as Christoph (a reference to Christo, perhaps? There is a line about an umbrella, picked up in a windstorm, injuring someone) is brilliant, too.",9,0,1,3 May 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," One Long Chase Scene. I HATE Chase Scenes.
","This movie starred the Reavers from Joss Whedon's Firefly TV show (that show is so awesome!) and the Serenity movie (the movie is so wonderful!) and the jungle guys from Peter Jackson's King Kong (that movie is so wacky!) and they race across the desert.And they race to one end of the desert (that took one hour) and then to the other end (that took another hour).And then the movie was over! Which was awesome because I hate chase scenes, which is what this race was. AND, I hated this movie! It was STUPID. I don't have any idea why this movie has garnered such positive reviews.I will mention that Charlize Theron looked wonderful. Those eyes! Surrounded by black paint! And Tom Hardy looked pretty good, too. And Nick Hoult was in it as a slavering fool. Normally, he's adorable, like in Jack the Giant Killer or in Warm Bodies when he's a zombie who realizes something terrible has happened to him. But none of them had that many lines. They were too busy chasing and racing to talk.",1,11,25,24 January 2016
