The Legend of Bagger Vance," Embarrassing swing detracts from a sweet film
","Ok, Ok - I realize that (as the title suggests) this film is supposed to be taken as a legend or even a fantasy, and that I should suspend my disbelief and just enjoy the ride. For the most part, I was able to. The script is literate and clever, the cinematography is gorgeous, the kid who plays Hardy is wonderfully natural, Jack Lemmon's voice-over is just folksy enough, Will Smith fits his role like an old broken-in glove, and the Matt/Charlize combo works nicely.But, my God! - couldn't Robert Redford have found an actor who at least knew how to swing a club? Now I think Matt Damon is a huge talent and a terrific actor, but c'mon - he looked like someone who had never picked up a club, and was then given a crash course just for this film. Later, after seeing the film, I learned that this is just what happened. I'm especially disappointed that Redford would do this, given that he made sure he himself looked quite credible swinging a bat and throwing a ball in 'The Natural'. (Perhaps having nightmarish visions of Anthony Perkins in 'Fear Strikes Out' gave him added motivation.)This is so important in films about any popular sport, since most of the audience, from watching the pros and top amateurs on TV, can recognize the form that's needed to play at a high level. Most of today's directors know this, and modern sports films have by and large become a great deal more athletically realistic and credible than sports films of the 40's and 50's, some of which were laughable. But, every so often, one still slips through the cracks. Shame on you, Robert Redford.",Null,1,3,17 August 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This
","This is my all time favorite film. Absolutely brilliant on all counts. It's the most biting satire of the awkwardness and folly of the military that has ever been screened. You're seeing actors at the peak of their form. I would rate George C. Scott's performance here on a par with his work in Patton. His comic timing is wonderful - not to mention Sterling Hayden (how did he keep a straight face saying some of those lines), Keenan Wynn (Mr. 'Prevert'), Slim Pickens and James Earl Jones just starting out (even back then he was reciting every line like it was Shakespeare).
There are so many great moments and memorable lines, right up to the closing montage and song. And what can I say about Peter Sellers. The man was a true genius. It's a bit eerie watching him disappear into those three characters. His phone conversation with the Soviet premier is hands down the finest monologue I've ever seen on film ('I'm sorry too, Dmitri').If you've never seen this film, please do yourself a huge favor and check it out. You won't be bored. Oh.....and keep close tabs on your precious bodily fluids!",10,1,1,2 September 2002
Glory," Very Moving
","I first saw this film a few years after it was released, and every few years since. It never fails to draw me in almost immediately. I feel so connected to the characters. There is one scene, however, that always stays with me long after. I'm talking about Denzel and the single tear. It's a terrific lesson for film producers and directors on what a gut-wrenching scene really is. No explosions, no gore, no frantic cutting with one-second shots, not even any dialogue. Just one closeup and one reaction shot, yet so much power! It's not possible to watch that scene and not feel his pain.
It's also so wonderful to see a film with a great ensemble cast of actors with many, at that time, who were right on the verge of stardom.",Null,0,0,20 January 2004
Lawrence of Arabia," Just Watch His Face
","I've lost count how many times I've seen this film and do not feel it necessary to detail its brilliance. Others in this column have already done so and very well. It's an epic film in every sense, and I have a suggestion the next time you see it. Look carefully at Lawrence's face, especially his eyes, in scenes where someone is speaking to him one-on-one and he is listening (his first meeting with Allenby in Allenby's office is an excellent example). His constant inner struggle that ranges from terrible self-doubt to an almost Messiah-complex is fascinating to watch. For me, that's where the real story lies - not so much in what he did, but how he dealt with it internally.I think if you try this, you'll experience a whole new side to this film and will appreciate it even more.",Null,1,3,18 January 2003
Braveheart," Robert Bruce's struggle underscores the film
","Kudos to Mel Gibson for an epic story and a wonderfully heroic character. I found myself, however, emotionally drawn more to the Robert Bruce character. Upon reflection, I realized that, contrasted to Wallace's war with the English, Bruce's war is with himself. His struggle embodies a universal theme that everyone can identify with - namely, do I follow my heart or do I follow my head? Who hasn't, at some point in their life, wrestled with this? In Bruce's case, he must choose between giving in to his passion and joining Wallace's crusade, or being coldly pragmatic and following the 'realpolitik' advice of his father.The scenes where Angus MacFadyen shows Bruce wrestling with his conscience and letting his turmoil surface are quite powerful and provide a more compelling and deeper emotional layer to the film.",Null,0,1,28 July 2002
