The Finest Hours," Incredible action, but dragged by a boring, schmaltzy, and redundant subplot
","The action scenes in this movie have incredible cinematography and incredible thrills. They're just outstanding. However, I can't give this a higher score due to the flaws and the lack of these incredible thrills that made the movie worth watching.However, the schmaltzy drama in the first 15 minutes or so tries to add emotional resonance but is boring and adds way too little to the film. The emotional resonance fails to kick in until around the second half. It finally becomes emotionally resonant right there.If the syrupy drama in the beginning were removed and the incredible action scenes were much longer, I could give this a 9 or maybe even a 10. Yes; the action scenes wee incredible, and the film was emotionally resonant around the last 30 minutes.+ Incredible rescue scenes and thrills<ul><li>Boring beginning</li></ul><ul><li>Uninteresting drama around first half</li></ul>",Null,1,1,15 October 2016

It just felt more like Star Wars awkwardly put into a WWII film, due to the tanks shooting out what looks like a bunch of laser shots. There were other unrealistic things, but man, I don't really feel like mentioning all of them.

After a power cut happened, though around 40 minutes into the movie, I realized that I probably didn't have to watch it all. The type of humour is somewhat appealing for my taste, but it just falls totally flat at many times and is very forgettable. It just felt as if funny jokes became unfunny.

How to Train Your Dragon 2," Unlike the first film, this one is just plain boring
","IMO, this is a VERY, VERY disappointing film. The first one was very good, but the second one had many things that were lacking from the first one.Seriously...HOW could this only get 0.3 points lower in IMDb ratings than the first film?HTTYD1 was enjoyable, emotionally resonant, and engaging with a plot that made me care about the characters quite a bit. I rarely watch movies more than once, but I could possibly watch this again since I watched it when I was like 11 or so. I gave the movie a 9/10.However, HTTYD2 was a MASSIVE drop. It wasn't even worth watching. I expected a movie with a 0.3 point drop to at least be okay, considering how I thought HTTYD1 was a nice film. However, it dropped from enjoyable and very good to somewhat boring and poor.What made the movie unenjoyable was a set of problems that all boiled down to a movie I wished I never watched. I watched to the end, for I hoped it would get better.What went wrong? First, the movie was just not enjoyable. It felt kind of boring and rarely entertaining. The characters and plot were unengaging, which was a shame, because there were many interesting plot points. However, they were poorly executed, leading to a convoluted, unengaging plot that felt really forced. Even the action was uninteresting, because the sides involved were characters I couldn't care about anyway. The introduction of the mother was done really poorly. Well, basically, the whole film lacked the engagement that compelled me in the first HTTYD.It was a waste of time to watch, because even with the great visuals and a few slightly emotional moments, the film felt too unengaging and boring to watch. The drama, adventure, and action were all uninteresting. Not one of the three was particularly better or worse than the others, but that's not saying anything when nothing was that interesting at all.+ Has some decent moments+ Great visuals<ul><li>Boring and dragging</li></ul><ul><li>Pacing felt awkward</li></ul><ul><li>Lack of believability</li></ul><ul><li>Unengaging characters</li></ul><ul><li>Not emotionally resonant like the first film</li></ul><ul><li>Badly introduced characters and plot points</li></ul><ul><li>Bad pacing that made it feel awkward to watch</li></ul>Rating: 4.

It Follows," It may be original and scary, but the plot drags too much, and it lacks enjoyment
","This felt more like an overlong TV episode rather than a movie. I did appreciate the originality of the idea and the ambiance that made it scary.

It took Nothing was really answered in the movie that well. It might be consistently scary, but it lacked in enjoyment value.At least the movie is watchable.

","The start is really cool, with very enjoyable action scenes. The emperor's perception of the hero originally could be a red herring...or not?

All those plot twists were annoying.The visuals are beautiful, but that's basically the only thing I can compliment.

Ip Man," An absolute masterpiece of a martial arts movie
","This is a martial arts movie. So it's just lots of mindless action scenes, right? No! This is way more than the mundane martial arts flick.There are just so many things about this movie that allows is to transcend as a martial arts movie.The first and foremost are the martial arts scenes. I've seen other martial arts movies, and those fighting scenes were 'cool,' but only in the sense that they are fun to watch; however, they are mainly placed only for the sake of having those scenes. But what about these action scenes? They are meaningfully placed into the film. In addition, they are more than 'cool'-looking; they are outstanding with the incredible realism and the true 'wow' factor that are absent in other martial arts films.The second thing that transcends is the plot. It is not deficient in plot at all unlike other martial arts movies. Its plot is reasonably good even when pitted against other movies outside of this genre that are expected to have good plots.The final thing is that the characters are just exceptional for this genre. Rather than a boring hero, we have someone of significant depth that is absent in other martial arts movies.This movie trumps other martial arts movies in so many ways that it is just amazing. It is a masterpiece of a martial arts movie that delivers due to action, characters, and plot that way exceed expectations.This is worthy of Academy Awards. It's not those mindless martial arts movies; it's very meaningful, resonant, and fine-crafted.+ GREAT, GREAT martial arts scenes+ Thoughtful story+ Great characters+ Emotional resonanceScore: 10.

Even Fast and Furious movies have less senseless action.The script is bad. Most jokes fall completely flat and even feel bad that they shouldn't be on there.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Lacks what made the first movie great
","The first movie was great. It was exciting, packed with funny jokes, and very emotionally resonant. The plot was also good without being flaky.
However, this seriously falters when compared to the first movie. It lacks the oomph the first movie had due to its dragging pace and lack of good characters to make you feel for what happened. The jokes feel forced here rather than funny. It also lacks the emotional resonance with poor, forced melodrama (and the characters, again). Finally, the plot is uninteresting and doesn't make a lot of sense.
As always, good visuals, but there should be no reason for this movie to be rated a 7.7 when it is far inferior from the first movie.",Null,1,2,27 July 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Disappointing but not awful -- has its moments but not funny enough for the running time
","Okay, so I thought this was going to be at least good enough to watch, considering how it had lots of good reviews. The trailer meant the movie looked alright to watch due to the mood (I didn't think anything was particularly funny in the trailer, though). However, it was not that good. The characters say lots of phrases and get into lots of situations, but they frequently felt kind of rushed and forced. Most importantly, a lot of those weren't that funny, some due to falling flat, but simply due to not being funny. There WERE occasional, much funnier responses, phrases, or situations, such as when Ron says something is an optical illusion, but that may probably be the only hilarious part of the movie. There are others that were reasonably funny, but there weren't enough of them.The reason I'm not being too harsh on the review is that the movie wasn't awful. It really wasn't. It was just disappointing, and probably not worth watching, except for a few funny scenes. The occasional funny jokes, as well as the characters saved this movie from being any worse, but they didn't make it great.Pros:<ul><li>Some funny jokes</li></ul><ul><li>Good character development</li></ul><ul><li>Slightly funny for many parts</li></ul>Cons:<ul><li>Most of the jokes weren't that funny and felt really forced</li></ul><ul><li>The jokes frequently fell flat, worsening the quality of the jokes</li></ul>Overall, I rate this a 5.

But not that enjoyable.It has its moments, but for a movie with all these cameos and stars, it should be much funnier. The jokes may be consistent, but I felt they were generally very slightly funny. However, I felt that they weren't funny enough to make the movie worth watching, as they only had me grinning, and I forced myself to laugh most of the time. There were some LOL moments, though (but only 1 or 2).It had its moments, but it was overall disappointing and not worth my time. 4",Null,1,1,21 June 2015
