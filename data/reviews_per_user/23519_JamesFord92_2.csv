Howl's Moving Castle," Amazing!
","I went to Howl's Moving Castle having been a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki and was impressed. It was on par with his other movies, which are all equally great. The animation was stunning and the musical score was fantastic. Billy Crystal as the voice of the fire demon Calcifer annoyed me slightly, but other then that the the voices were great. The story could be confusing at times but was still good. The only really bad part for me was that the ending was sort of stupid. Other then that the movie was great, and had great animation. Howl's moving Castle is a good movie even compared to Miyazaki's other films such as Naussica and Spirited Away.",8,4,5,12 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the prequels
","I went to Revenge of the Sith not really knowing what to expect. Everybody I know that had seen it was giving me mixed reviews. Some thought that it was terrible, while others said it was one of the best Star Wars movies ever.It definitely was not better then the original three but it was a very entertaining movie. The special effects and fight scenes were good but the film lacked a good script. Even proved good actors such as Ewan Magregor seemed bad. Hayden Christiansen seems to have little or no acting talent. With the faults aside, Geoge Lucas has made a good film and Revenge of the Sith is a success and is worth going to the theater to see. It is also definitely better then The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.",8,0,1,24 May 2005
