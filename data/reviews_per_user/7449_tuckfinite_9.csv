The Equalizer," Since the 70's Intro of Sick Revenge Fantasies, What's Happened?
","Well the Cold War ended. Violent crime rates plummeted. But Hollywood vigislaughtergore(new word) has sky rocketed. Words like pandering and exploitation come to mind. But especially hypocrisy. I doubt that a single person who works as an instructor of firearms would endorse this film genre. Certainly not anyone in the NRA. Then I ask myself why do some people want to give Washington a pass? He's successful and rich? Huh? Feudalism 2.0 has landed. People at the top of the social pyramid are just innately better than common folk. Well the ones that have been anointed by the media that is. I suppose it really helps to work in the media. I don't live near the media centers, where should I go to grovel? Is just paying for this crapola sufficient tribute?",1,2,8,19 July 2018
Hot Fuzz," Michael Scarne vs Golden Face Was Better
","Somehow the 20 min epic featured within an episode of The Office, was a funnier action movie parody than the 2hr Hot Fuzz. On the other hand the Torrente series, even the later ones, were funnier. 20 min or 10 hrs? Perhaps it isn't really that hard to make fun of Hollywood unless you're pandering and being self indulgent in you're attempt to make fun of pandering and self indulgence. Angel unlike Torrente is the straight arrow and just about everyone else is corrupt and weird. Pegg is playing primarily a straight man. And he's onscreen at least 90% of the time. Does anyone see a problem? Jack Benny was the best straight man ever and he logged less screen time in To Be or Not To Be. Pegg is no Jack Benny.",1,2,11,22 July 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Domestication, Mass Production and Marketing of the Tobacco Plant
","Nicotine is a mild diverse psychoactive drug. Scientific, technological, and commercial ingenuity and innovation resulted in production of sufficient quantities of nicotine to satisfy public demand. The demand was so great because psychotropic drugs assuage fear(aka tension, stress, anxiety)and prop up ego. ALSO THE SHORT TERM SIDE EFFECTS WERE NEGLIGIBLE. Do you wonder what might be discovered if a few hundred mil develop a 2 pack a day THC habit? But the question here is why do people give a damn about cgi and comic book characters literal or virtual? No relevance to their lives. Just pretty colors and bright shiny objects? It assuages fear and supports ego. Thinly disguised mild paganism with negligible short term side effects.",1,0,8,25 July 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," So This Is What You Get for a100 mil Student Film
","Let's just look at the two leads. I assume they got the roles because they're very thin and received solid Cs at acting school. Cs due to extra credit for whining, sniveling, and looking constipated. Just the way Gable and Leigh showed emotion. Or perhaps Rebel Without a Cause would be a better comparison. With Stone in the James Dean role and Garfield with Wood's or Mineo's role might be better for Garfield. Wood might be too butch. To be fair there was a conscious effort in the writing and directing to make Goldfarb weak to fit a PC agenda. But Goshdarned is already weak. Compare him to a professional actor like Bruce Dern. Dern has way more screen presence. But even though Dern conveys certain things to an audience quite well, he is limited compared to an actor like Steve McQueen. Gumfair has no subtlety with facial communication and doesn't seem to know anything about body language and trick ticks to hold attention.",1,1,5,22 August 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Pick Fav Fallacy; Bogus Competent Authority or Causation vs Correlation
","Most of the critical reviews are by fanboys. For the most part they're right about the silly premise. If you're in the business of saving the world/galaxy/universe, you are the competent governing authority philosophically, morally, legally. By what right can the UN claim authority? They have no mandate or competence to deal with such tasks. Many of their members are illegitimate or obsolete shells. The US isn't really a country anymore than the EU is. Feudalism 2.0 has landed in the West with both feet. With geography being much less important to the wielding of power than feudalism's first go round. Then we're treated to Vision's brilliant theory that since the number of heroes has increased that's responsible for the increase in super villains and ET invasions. Now you could have had realistic premise for an internecine conflict. The Avengers stage a false flag attack to raise money for their retirement. Ironically that's what this movie is really about anyway.",1,2,5,8 July 2018
Gone Girl," Charles Sobhraj
","I'm barely watching this idiotic movie on tv while listening to music and writing this review. I assume it's better closed captioned. I thought this would be an opportune time to listen to a group called Garbage. And I sort of like their song Push It. To top it off, before the movie I watched a news story on the 'red tide' in Florida. I'm likely in danger of being framed for the kidnapping of a space alien living a double life as an agronomist in Manhattan and a magnetic north pole impersonator.",1,0,7,15 August 2018
22 Jump Street," 5 Conglomerates Control 90% US an Europe Commercial Media Results In?
","I read through quite a few reviews to see if anyone else got the joke. This movie made a couple of hundred million profit. Sequels don't have a great reputation. How good could the word of mouth have been? Instead of the audience laughing at the movie, the movie laughs at the audience. No it isn't the first time. But now they don't hide it.",1,0,3,3 April 2019
The Waterboy," 'The Waterboy' Review by mccartyandrew Shows He Got The Joke
",McBinder came close to the truth. It's a one joke movie and it's on the public. To win a bet? Prove a point? Both? But the last laugh is on Sandler and his merry band. The Waterboy is horribly dated. Completely undercut by societal devolution. Perhaps by Sandler himself. I've heard his recent efforts are atrocious.,1,1,5,29 September 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Hamlet Quixote vs Neville's Nightmare vs Colbert's Golem
","I don't like comic books, cgi, or action movies. I've watched very few movies the last quarter century or so. The Castle, Donnie Darko, and Kontroll come to mind. For financial reasons I'm something of a shut in at the moment and it's put me in an Ignatius O'reilly kind of mood. While I'm no expert on this genre, it seems obvious the dierector is attempting to out dark all opposition. That's it, period, end of story. All the rationalizing, analyzing, theorizing is superfluous. Square peg not fit round hole. It might be barely possible this is part of an overarching strategy to morph traditional comic book form into the newer dark graphic novel genre. There's a conspiracy worth 1.21 joules energy.",1,0,3,2 July 2018
