First Man," probably worth seeing
","It is a good film up to about its middle, and after that it is a mediocre film. It's like the filmmakers ran out of their inspiration halfway. I never liked Ryan Gosling, but surprisingly, his performance in this film was rather remarkable. Claire Foy, on the other hand, plays as a heartless and cold b**** (censored by IMDB) with no signs of affection toward her husband. I do not know if that was the intent, but I suppose she is just incapable of producing any other character. The film is probably worth seeing for its depiction of the dangers and perils that early astronauts were facing while making those first steps into space.",7,0,0,29 April 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Do not watch this film unless you are gay
","If you are gay, then you might like this film. Otherwise it is excruciating to watch, it is dull, boring, disgusting and bears no artistic value whatsoever. I tried twice to force myself to watch it, I could only go as far as about a middle. I could not force myself to finish it.",1,7,25,17 April 2019
