The Hangover," Seriously what was funny?
","I just watched the movie and can't see what people find as funny. The movie was crude, fine. I have no problems with crude humor, actually will roar in laughter at it. It just has to be funny. I kept waiting for the funny parts of this movie to happen. -----A guy using the toilet while a tiger keeps roaring to get his attention. Wait it is working, the guy keeps peeing while he turns to notice the tiger----- Yes that got a huge roar of laughter from the crowd. They meet up with a girl. The one guy unknowingly married her the night before. Okay the joke is coming. She says she is a dancer, then corrects herself and says she is actually a prostitute. That was the joke, hear the crowd roar. I kept waiting for her to do something funny, come on get crude I don't care, just make it funny!!! I don't know how much you can say on this site but the friends tell the guy his wife is the one who cheated on him. He said it was alright because the guy didn't for censorship reasons 'deposit DNA' inside the woman. Yes, it was filthy, didn't offend me but didn't' make me laugh either. I just hope that we don't get into a wave of films just making a rude comment to get a laugh without it actually having to be funny.",2,9,19,27 August 2009
