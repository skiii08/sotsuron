Minority Report," Not his best but definitely up there
","For my money, a lot better than AI. The cast was better at the very least. Tom Cruise was great. Sam Morton, one of our very own, was quite compelling. And Collin Farrel was good too. Not great. But good. The visual style was so confident. It seems like a cliche to compliment Speilberg but he really outdid himself here. Nine out of ten.",9,0,0,7 August 2002
Men in Black II," A poor excuse for a sequel
","Aside from the talking dog this film is not very funny and not very interesting. Some of the special effects were all right, but nothing special. It looks like the lot of them were in it for the paycheck. There will probably be a MIII. I certainly won't pay ten quid to see it. Four out of ten.",4,0,0,7 August 2002
