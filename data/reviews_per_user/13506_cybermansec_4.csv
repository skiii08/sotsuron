Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty Boring
","Pretty boring to be completely honest. The beginning of it is eerie and exciting but as soon as they get to Tatooine and meet Anakin Skywalker (Jake LLoyd) it suddenly turns boring as moon dust! The pod race was one of the moments I was waiting for, but it was a little bit of a let-down. And then when Darth maul comes on to the screen, it gets brilliant (Ray Parks is brilliant in this). The lightsaber duel is brilliant and exciting, but 'Mesa Jar Jar Binks'! Jar Jar should have died in this, they should have never had him. Although no star wars is terrible this is my worst, because it lacks excitement in scenes.Rating: 3 out of 5",6,0,2,24 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Bril movie!
",I enjoyed this movie. Johnny was really good as a pirate and he just looks the part for a pirate (Especially when he isn't in the movies). It was very funny and very good and brings pirates back into fashion. Keeps you busy and excited throughout the whole thing. It isn't right though that they'll make two other ones or sequels to it. I'll see them don't get me wrong but this end is just wow though. I enjoyed watching it. *Spoiler part* (Look away if you don't want me to ruin it) It is about a pirate who is not afraid of meeting people who disagree with him. He meets Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who is a blacksmith to save his girlfriend from another evil pirate who previously stole Johnny's ship. They set out to find her causing havoc everywhere. And in the end Johnny dies well not dead turns into a skeleton when fighting Barbossa and kills him. That's it really but if I didn't make it sound that good go see it anyway. End of review. But I'm giving it 8/10 because it's to good. S E EY A!,8,1,3,22 October 2005
Sleepy Hollow," Great!!!
",I was very pleased with this remake from the original tale by Washington Irving. Johnny Depp plays the detective Ichabod Crane who goes in search of a murderer roaming the streets of Sleepy Hollow. Named the Headless Horseman this murderer was once a brave Hessian warrior who lost his head in battle. Now he haunts Sleepy Hollow in search for a head. But Ichabod doesn't believe them because in New York they don't believe in ghouls and goblins. But he sees this murderer and finds his resting place which is a tree. Successfully sleeps three times in which he has three flashbacks. In the end he finds the head and throws it to the horseman and then now that he isn't headless he takes his 'bride' into the tree or hell on Earth. All in all a very good movie.,9,2,4,2 November 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Great!!
",I loved this movie!! When I first saw the advert for it I was like oh my god who'd want to see a piece of rubbish like that! But I went and saw and I was like wow! How can you achieve such brilliance! I'm not a huge fan of Tim Burton but I liked the nightmare before Christmas and I loved this! Go and see it!!! Brilliant!!! Two thumbs up!! I liked the way Augustus Gloop went up the pipe and I kind of laughed (not out loud) at the special effects used on Violet turning into a blueberry! And did any of you know that the squirrels that attacked Veruca are real and the Oompa Loompas are not! I was very impressed by Johnny's performance as Willy Wonka he was absolutely brilliant at it!! I am very impressed with the songs and my favourite is definitely Willy Wonka's but I loved it compared to the old one (that I wasn't so keen on) and this one (apart from putting in flashbacks and changing the end) sticks to the book! Tim has done extremely well on this movie and I'm waiting for the release of Corpse Bride which is a definite musical and I'm positive about that Tim's great on this! Brilliant!,10,0,3,8 October 2005
