Blade Runner 2049," three hours of utter tedium and brain crushing boredom
","i cannot believe these ten star comments, first the visuals were mostly flat, there was no explanation why in this time there were virtually no people around, one scene only with about thirty extras, no lights seems to be on either in the shots were he is flying over the city. more importantly you had a very thin plot that could have been told in less than an hour. nothing happens for most of the film. it is as if all concerned were on valium. the music was just noise. talk about an anti-climatic ending, the film just whimpers out. none of the very little plot made any sense. so here we have yet again critics raving about nothing. an insult to the original in every way. do not waste your time or money going to see this. i was going to list the many non-sensical things in the film but on reflection i don't think the film deserves anymore of my time",1,228,438,5 October 2017
Captain Phillips," no where near as good as i was hoping
","The first thing to say about this film is its at least 30 minutes too long. Why almost everyone now has to stretch films out to running times that do not warrant the story is beyond me. It is a simple and true tale of a man battling great odds, which i think could have been told in a better way. We never get to see how is family are coping with the situation, this would have given the film its much needed emotional kick. The thing the carries the film is Tom Hanks' obvious charisma, but even with that half way through it starts to become tedious, the lifeboat section seemed to go on and on, there was too much repetition and no movement forward just so that the film makers could get the film to over two hours. It also has a terrible ending with the Captain being shouted at by a nurse with one of the worst voices i have come across, she just does not shut up, this was supposed to be therapeutic but was very grating.",5,30,67,10 October 2013
Skyfall," this is not bond this is boring
","They have finally killed off James Bond, Skyfall has to be the worst Bond ever. No script, no pace, no energy a lifeless plodding mess. This is a typical Same Mendes film, the guy has no idea. Daniel Craig is a good actor and from what I can see in interviews a decent bloke. But his Bond is wooden, without with or charm and certainly not suave. A stupid plot about a hard done by ex agent, who is going to bring MI6 down, with a list of all its agents, which half way through the film is completely forgotten about. All we have here is a below average, action thriller, where the thrills and action pieces are not exciting at all. The saddest thing is that because of the huge success of the film this is what we are going to get in the future. Bond was created as a mythical fantasy figure, who wisecracked was good at his job taking us places we would never get to. The girls, gadgets and guns, were what made the films stand out from any other action movie, now they are gone, to be replaced by so called reality, which by the way this film does not depict in any credible way, there just would not be a public parliamentary enquiry about the secret services. As for the sheep that are today's critics yet again they have not reviewed the film but the people who made it.",1,13,29,16 November 2012
Minority Report," another over-rated spielberg film
","Yet again critics and some public go ape over a standard action movie. What starts of as something different, soon turns into just another chase movie, I guessed who the baddie was once Cruise was on the run. What is it when people rate a film not on its own merit, but by who makes it.  Same applies  to Gangs of new York.  Minority Report does not have any of the paranoia that is the trademark of Dick.  A much better adaptation of a Dick story is Impostor with Gary Sinese, this film has twists and turns right up to the last minute, and leaves you breathless, on one tenth of the budget it delivers actions and thrills.",2,1,3,21 January 2003
Gravity," i have given it 5 stars for the graphics only otherwise its a 1 star film
","Oh deary me, the sheep like critics here in the UK and the US have all gone gaga over this really inane and very stupid film, with two lead characters who would never be allowed in space. Apart from utter trivial and bad dialogue, with no depth or feeling, we do not care one iota for them. the bullock character is so bad and useless and mostly out of control, yet we have to swallow that she makes it. the death of clooney is utterly pointless, there was no reason for him to die. the science, well the science does not exist in this movie, things happen that just would not. the debris that hits them would be falling as it rotates round the earth so would not be in the same orbit second time around, they very conveniently have the Chinese station doing that but not the other floating objects. What keeps really annoying me is that critics here that write for the so called intelligent papers and media, go in and see a film like this and leave their brains at the door, i know assume that in fact they do not possess and intellect whatsoever. they write like 14 year old fan boys, if any unknown director or someone they considered a hack had made this they would have laughed at it, but because it was cuaron they lapped it up.",5,16,27,17 November 2013
Star Trek," star trek back with a bang
","it was fast at least warp 9, apart from over use of the shaky cam , this was great fun and perfectly pitched to bring the franchise back. a wonderfully chosen cast to play all our beloved characters, a smart and funny script. my only complaint was it could have had a few more quieter moments. even though some of the replacements may not have had a strong physical bearing , the spirit of the characters was most certainly there. karl urban as mccoy was spot on and anton yelchin although much younger makes a great chekov. quinto is uncanny as spock. and pine makes a more handsome kirk, which i am sure will satisfy all the ladies. keeping true with the exterior of the enterprise and spicing up the interior. i am pretty certain that all lifelong trekkies will be pleased and that the film will bring in new younger audiences, so far the film of the year",9,8,28,27 April 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," It's good to be a kid again
","It's great to see a movie made by people who remember what it was like going to saturday morning pictures, where our parents would leave us at the door and in we went with a few hundred others to let rip, and boo, hiss and cheer.  Pirates brings all that back, with the writing, action, effects and great perfomances by all bar the still not good keira, she does try but does not quite make it. she was crap in beckham, and is not the great beauty she and some others think she is.  Anyway the film was great fun and as everyone has picked up on Johnny Depp shows how good he is as an actor and what a great sense of humour he has.  Keith Richards should be proud as he is now immortalised on celluloid.",6,0,1,15 August 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," Better than the first one
","Well its been 4 years, and here it is, saw it last night, with much anticipation, because of the title i really thought that this was going to be Nolanised, and disappoint me as the two dark knight films had. silly title really as its not dark at all. the breezy humour between the characters is still there, JJ signature len's flare is still there and it rattles along at 300 miles an hour. the two hour plus running time just flew by, and no sooner had we sat down, the film had come to a brilliant, moving and satisfying end. i am not going to disclose any of the plot or who is who, just to say that they have certainly built on and taken the characters further, they have also brilliantly referenced star trek lore, bridging the past with this great new time line. the 3d once again was utterly pointless i will be hoping to see it again if i can find a big screen that will be showing it in 2d, they have got to stop this 3d nonsense, if you are going to use 3d them make the 3d count and give us scenes of things coming at you. 3D MAKES THE SCREEN AND EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING IN IT SMALLER. NOTE TO ALL FUTURE SPECTATORS TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF Occasionally AND YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE. anyway still did not ruin a great film and a great time.",9,67,140,4 May 2013
Spider-Man 2," critics have no judgment whatsover
","the critics in the US and the UK all went for this, all because the name of the director is sam raimi, now i am a great fan of mr. raimi he has made some great film, spiderman and spiderman 2 are not among them, like burton's batman films they are both boring and badly made. spidey one was really really bad, 2 fares a little bit better but not much. lets start with the script unbelievable tosh. in spidey 1 uncle ben and aunt may seem to have a nice little abode, with peter parker staying there and helping to provide. uncle ben dies in the first movie so what does parker do he moves out leaving his aunt to fend for herself, so she has to find the mortgage and he has to find rent for a sleaze dump. parker has these great powers, the powers of a spider quick thinking, fast acting, so how come when he is not spiderman he is a dork and a loser, at least clark kent pretended to be a buffoon but our dear friend here is hopeless at everything. the first 90 minutes or so (although it seemed an eternity ) was nothing but parker losing this, getting trod on and endlessly moping about MJ. and even raimi's attempt at humour fall totally flat, the cupboard scene when he delivers the pizzas is to long by far, no timing here at all. the cgi was crap and this cost $200million, and the whole plot utterly predictable. why does everyone think this movie is dark, it is about as dark as a teletubbies episode. now daredevil was a great dark and moody film, a masterpiece compared to this drivel. how bad will 3 be",2,2,7,9 August 2004
Pirate Radio," one of the worst films ever made
","how a script so bad was greenlit in the first place is a mystery, i suppose it being written by richard curtis helped. then add really bad direction, some of the worst acting ever seen by a professional and usually good cast, and a story line so stupid it is beyond moronic. i grew up listening to the pirate stations here in the UK not one of their djs was as boring and stupid as this lot. as for the flash King of djs played by rhys ifans, what a joke, what a clichÃ©. avoid this utter rubbish at all costs, quite a few people i know myself included either could not make it to the end or carried on with gritted teeth and utter disbelief at the all round crappiness of it all",1,26,55,8 November 2009
Finding Nemo," they have done it again
","There are, thank God some constants in life,things that you can rely on. Looks like Pixar are becoming one, 5 out of 5 times they have delivered perfectly formed gems, for the kids in all of us.  nemo, is witty, touching, educational, knowing (without being smug or clever)and brilliantly realised. the animation keeps getting better and better, they have wisely dropped the musical number. the choice of voices again absolutly inspired.  God i wish i had shares in them, they are about the only people who are delivering great commercial Art.",8,0,1,3 November 2003
Spider-Man 3," repeat ad nauseum
","as with superman returns which just recycled badly the first christopher reeve film, so with these dreadful spider man movies we have had the same boring story in all three, always start with a complete waste of time on the relationship with mary jane, and spidey moping around like a big kid, then onto the same villains etc, i never liked the first two and now it has taken the rest of the world to realise that they are all bad, yet like sheep everyone turns up at the first weekend, to see this trash, all my admiration for raimi has now evaporated, none of these films show any of his usual imagination, flair and good story telling, mind you the same applies for the xmen movies another bad series from one fo the most overrated directors working today bryan singer, i recommend everyone goes back and re-view daredevil, not perfect but better the spiderman.xmen and the god awful superman returns, spider 3 manages to be worse than superman a feat i did not think possible",1,8,13,11 May 2007
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," sorry nowhere near as good as the first one
","was so looking forward to this, as i thought the first one was great better than the iron man movies, but it was a let down, a very generic plot, you knew who the main baddie was from the start, could have made more of the winter soldier, action scenes were very good and them exposition scenes of utter tediousness and boredom, Redford looked like he wanted to be somewhere else, Evans and Scarlett were good as usual i just wish they had come up with a less predictable plot and some better dialogue, also could have done with a bit more humour, they have to get the captain to lighten up a bit, he and thor are always so solemn, this lacked the originality of the first film, and the inventiveness that it had.",5,9,21,3 April 2014
Life of Pi," big anticipation and a bit of a let down
","the trailer looked great the reviews were glowing, was this going to be one of the films of the year. sadly no, the structure did not work, by knowing he survives, because he is telling his story takes away any tension. the interview he gives is more like a bad voice over, and is not needed. it would have been better just to tell the story straight. as with all of Lee's films it looked great, but was empty again like most of his films. this does not have anything to say, and the terrible ending,was it true or not, spoils and takes away and potential deepness in the story. now onto to the again wasted use of 3d, when will directors learn if you are going to shoot in 3d then make it 3d not just a tiny bit, i would rather see dramatic films like this in 2d, even when there was opportunity to dazzle us in some of the action scenes, it all seemed flat.3d gives one the chance to be in the frame if used to its full extent,which very few people apart from Cameron have done.",5,1,11,8 January 2013
Interstellar," overblown/overlong/overrated
","His 4th dud in a row, a ridiculous plot, for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn, so no animals, birds or fish, even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing. Seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground. never mind lets move on, once again Nolan's characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things. anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears, she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so, the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on, the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle, the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away, just one example of quite few.the biggest plot hole is this, for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space, he becomes super intelligient, because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind, how he knows this we do not know, given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable, he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code, anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever. now to the film making, others have mentioned its look , well to me it looked shabby, endless shots of aircraft wings, no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars. during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close. in fact thank God i did not see this in imax, would have been a complete waste of time. and now the noise, with hans zimmer's worst and most bombastic score , added onto very loud sound effects, with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches. the end did not make any sense at all. but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover.",1,98,213,10 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," so so sad it has to come to this
","What a sad and tragic end. as many have said before eps 1,2,3 were not great but they kept within the star wars universe and at least had proper story lines through them. force awakens rekindled that a bit and stayed wtihin its universe, it also had a decent plot, humour and you got to know the characters, it also had humour, then came the disaster that was Last Jedi, destroying all that went before, with a nonsensical plot, magical elements, scneses just put together without coherence or neccessity, characters that did not mean anything. Rise tries to move forward from there but only succeeds in a very small way, it has to repeat from eps 4 to 6 give some sort of continuity, but that was just lazy, repeating big story moments re luke and his father now rey and her revelation, this had no where the same shock gasping impact as i am your father. i came back and watched ep IV again and just saw how great it still is , no where near the same amount of minlesss action, the pacing was way slowere and better we get characters, emotion, humour and when the action starts it does not go on for over, Rise was constnact frenectic movement action everyone talking really loudly no scnenes of actual meaning full dialogue. this is committe writing and film making, there is no vision behind it, no care or love. Lucas has stories for the last three i would love to know his version maybe its not too late to find out where he took his characters. he based the saga on classic world myths and archetypes he consulted with people like joseph campbell, which is why the apppealed and worked on a universal level. hollywood needs to find writers and film makers that have some depth that have some wisdom i bet there are fan stories that put these last episodes to shame. Solo and Rogue one had much better writing and satsfied much more that these

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," the force is back big time
","the force is back big time, a slow start may cause tripidation, but after twenty minutes we are off, the first chase with anakin and obi wan after an assassin sets the pace, which never really lets up. i am not going to go into plot details as this would ruin it for anyone who has not seen it.  but just to say there are scenes which make you leap out of your seat.  a great tag line would be 'more light sabres than you could shake a stick at@.go and see it i shall be going at least another three times.as for the usual boring critics, who never understood the films ignore them",10,0,0,16 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," a masterpiece, a work of art and great entertainment
","I am posting this comment again as it did not appear when originally written over 15 months ago.  fellowship is cinema at its absolute best. this is what the medium is about. the film is a masterpiece and a great work of art and entertainment.  both the original cinema release and the extended version on dvd, never fail to weave the most magical spell no matter how many times i watch the film.  from casting, music, action and effects, there is not a foot put wrong.  jackson was the best choice of person to make these films and he has shown, what a few of us have know for the last 12 years, what a great talent and human being he is.  i urge everyone to get and watch the extras on the dvds different stuff on both version, listening and watching how this extraordinary trilogy was brought to the screen, is a lesson in how to make films.  the obvious love and dedication gone into this is so great that it makes the endeavour as appealing as the end result",10,1,2,12 February 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," could they not see the obvious, what a let down
","i have to agree with the comments gone before, the brothers must be the only people not to have thought about the matrix within a matrix possibility. even if they had not gone for that, they could have come up with something better than this.  basically there was no more plot, i loved the first two, and it seems that they put all their energy and ideas into reloaded and had nowhere to go, revolutions feels like the middle film, there should have been two movies not three as  reloaded gave us all the philosophy,  just think, in revolutions morpheus becomes a wimp,there is no reason for what happens to trinity,  we have two redundant love stories, neo/trinity and link/zee utter waste of time, and the kid,really annoying.    one decent action scene the attack on the dock.  the nightlclub fight was pathetic, half decent last twenty minutes, but still a major letdown.  as for morpheus' last line, please.",5,0,0,4 November 2003
Man of Steel," pretty good comic movie
","Man of Steel almost matched Batman Begins as a very good origins story. it is slightly too long, and i could have done without a great deal of shaky cam, znyder ruined good dialogue/character scenes by shaking the camera too much, when are directors going to get it into their thicks heads that by shaking the camera the audience is alienated from the characters and story, all we notice is the camera moving for no reason, this does not imply reality. the 3d was again utterly pointless, please stop doing these conversions that again distract from the film. but having said that it is a very enjoyable and at quite a few times a moving film, you do feel for all the lead characters and even zod is given legitimate reasons for his action, Cavill is very good, not quite up to Christopher Reeve, but the nearest i think anyone can get to him. for once i did not find hans zimmer's music annoying and intrusive, this is by far one of his better scores, the main theme had a majestic and stirring feel to it. all in all a good re boot of a franchise that has been ignored for far too long",8,1,6,5 July 2013
Cold Mountain," joins a list of big films that are bad beyond belief
","minghella has hit a home run, along with shyamala all his films are turkeys.they are expensively mounted star studded affairs but they are all still bad. how could this get nominated for Oscars the script is dire, the acting by jude law and nicole kidman is even worse, only rene zellwegger, brendan gleason and jack white are watchable. its direction is turgid, every frame saying look at what an important film this is, which of course it is not. crap philosophying, and cod psychology. there has always been a tradition of ponderous, boring filmmakers, george stevens and otto preminger come to mind, new names to this tradition of self important and 'grand' directors include sam mendes, bertolucci, and quite a few other British and europeans. its amazing how critics get fooled by the names and really do not see whats on screen..avoid at all costs",1,8,15,26 July 2004
American Beauty," yet again the critics and the american academy get it wrong
","a film so up its own end it hurts.  after a promising start, this slides into cliche and over the top melodrama trying to be funny, all good actors, are put to no good use by a mediocre script and flat direction how the guy got an oscar for this is amazing, or maybe not the academy has not been know to vote for the best in any year, they always seem to vote politcally, so all the directors probably thought that no one esle would for mendes, but of course they did.  its funereal pace and obvious gags make it hard going to sit through and the confused and 'lets be clever' ending leaves you feeling that it really has been a waste of time",1,12,31,26 June 2002
Dunkirk," a rather pointless and flat film
","could not see the point of this film, as usual all the critics applaud a very flawed, unemotional and very banal film i was looking for the experience, the spectacle but there was nothing. the cutting between the timelines was utterly pointless and distracting, in fact everything in the film makes sure you do not get involved, you do not care for anyone or what is going on. Again Nolan puts in really bad unbelievable things, would a pretty heavy spitfire be able to glide and manouvre for some considerable time and then do a perfect landing. once again he bombardes you with an ear splitting soundtrack, zimmers pounding racket, bombs, bullets and other sound effect have the effect of distancing you from everything. in the entire film i don't think one boat or ship was seen moving even when they were supposed to. there were over 900 boats of various sizes, he shows about ten, in the air the luftwaffe were creating havoc, we see three spitfires and about six to ten German planes. all in all an insult to the men being rescued and the people who came for them.",1,16,28,10 August 2017
No Country for Old Men," sorry but the critics and the academy have yet again got it all wrong
","once again the name of the coen brothers ensures that the slavish critics will heap praise on mediocre material. this film was interesting for the first hour, then the suspicion that it is not going to go anywhere starts to dawn. after so many homily stories and not great dialogue the film starts to bore. the acting by all the leads is very good and it is that more than anything else that keeps you watching. everything in the second half is repetitious, the barden character is made out to be some sort of philosopher, ( a very bad and trite one) the coens think the dialogue is profound, its not. but the worst thing is how critics have fallen for nothing, we live in a constant state of the emperor's new clothes now, how this film ended up as the best film of the year is utterly beyond me, the two big critic's films last year were this and there will be blood, both films in my view were possibly the most boring films of the year.",3,1,7,30 June 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," boring! boring!boring!
","a long winded title for a long winded film, that thinks its characters are truly wonderful people. they are not, from jesse downwards we are dealing with thieves and murderers, and nothing more, the dialogue is trite, the endless shots of nothing, the interminable scenes that go no where. i have to say this, the majority of IMDb users seem to be people who are intent on showing of by posting comments that are as pretentious and long winded as the films they like. this story warrants a film of no more than 90 minutes long, that's how long it should have taken the makers to tell their story and make their point, which how adulation turns to bitterness and then revenge, i suppose this style owes a great deal to that other long winded film maker sergio leone, who started of well and as his popularity increased his films got longer and longer till they really started to get boring almost from the beginning, i know there is a generation of film goers that think his films are masterpieces, these are people who do not know about economy of story telling or how to keep whats in the frame interesting, clint eastwood went on to become a brilliant filmmaker by taking the good and then being able to tell a story simply, directly and with great emotion, the outlaw josey wales, is worth a thousand jesse james, and can be viewed again and again.",Null,8,15,14 July 2008
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," too long by far
","Dear Peter Jackson, after giving us perfect films in the Rings trilogy, you now have to go and spoil things. the warnings started with King Kong a very good film but a half hour too long. You then take what should have been a smallish film and you blow The Lovely Bones up and inflate it to a level that brings on tedium. And now you take a small book and slight story and again inflate it to a ridiculously long running time. What should have been one punchy maybe three hour film you decided to make into three, and by judging the first one, overlong and unnecessarily long films. The other big contention with The Hobbit is your high frame rate, most of the film especially the interiors look like TV used to look in Britain, many decades ago, TV drama used to use film for all exterior scenes and Video for interiors and you would notice the big change in the look the film sequences giving an added lustre and look with the interiors dull and flat, well that's how many shots look like in the hobbit dull and flat, there is no magic no FILM look. The 3d was basically non existent. Considering this is made 12 years after Fellowship, and should have looked way better, its pretty dismal going. Also by making the Orcs cgi quite a bit has been lost here,the fights had no real impact. its a great shame that someone who started out making small but perfect films with short running times has now become so bloated.",6,21,65,9 December 2012
Saving Private Ryan," i film i avoided for years but was finally persuaded to see
","i saw a very cheap DVD of the film going for sale so a friend persuaded me to buy it, i have avoided since it came out, i now know that i was totally right to avoid the film, it is badly written, badly directed but worst of all utterly boring. previous knowledgeable posts have stated how inaccurate in almost all ways the film is. this is a constant Spielberg trait, he never cares for accuracy or logic even within his own film universe. he will do scenes just for the sake mainly of his 'great shots', the times he has the men framed against a setting sun in silhouette just got tedious. for years spielberg has been hailed by critics and public as this master film maker and story teller but in reality he probably has made only a couple of decent films, his recent Lincoln was an utter bore,War Horse just about got by. one of his other traits is the constant intrusion of john williams' music as in his other films the music is pretty incessant there were scenes of quiet dialogue where music comes in that was utterly over the top",1,1,9,15 August 2013
Foxcatcher," one of the most boring films i have ever seen
","Again for some reason critics here in the UK and the US have raved about this utter tosh. Scenes where nothing happens that go on and on and on and on. Characters with no development or depth to them. Tatum shuffles and has just the one look of vacancy on his face, the character is presented as maybe autistic and of low intelligence. this type of wrestling is really boring to watch, and here there is no attempt to add any energy or zest to the fights. this is probably the most listless and lifeless film i have seen for a long time, it is as though everyone was given huge amounts of tranquilisers both in front of and behind the camera before each shot. Probably the best cure for insomnia going at the moment, just put this on if you cannot go to sleep and i guarantee within ten minutes you would be of.",1,20,43,7 January 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," he has no idea of TV history
","First off the film was a total bore, one hour too long, the scenes of filming the TV shows were absolute rubbish and really boring, we are supposed to see scenes being shot, yet they are cut as in a finished film, what would happend is you would shoot the scene from one camera one angle, cut and go to the next it would not be edited till the end, the violence shown in the TV shows just would not be there at that time, you would not see any blood. he shows the spaghetti westerns in 4x3 academy ration they would have all been in Scope/panavision wide screen. Next Sharon Tate has no real reason to be in the film, as in the sordid boring 'fairy Tale', the gang end up in the house net door . as for the dialogue yet again his fans are taken by really what is flat, boring not in the slightest bit witty or funny. I was hoping to like it, but there was so much wrong in the film and as many have mentioned before no plot or any character development at all. just meandering set pieces that go no where",1,116,218,1 August 2019
The Lives of Others," at last the academy are getting things right
","this is one of the best films in recent years, and fully deserving of its foreign language Oscar. virtually everything in this film is near perfect the writing, photography, music and performances. it is also a film of deep emotion and tragic events. that it is based on real events that happened in East Germany makes it all the more poignant and tragic. there are no real heroes or villains, just ordinary people caught up in a ridiculous political system which breeds mistrust and fear. the coming down of the berlin wall gives this film its very powerful ending, and an emotional lift right at the end. I recommend this film very strongly to people who are put off by subtitles, do give it a chance and see the original German version with subtitles",10,4,6,9 October 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," how could new line have cut what is now in the extended dvd
","the two towers was beyond brilliant as released in cinemas, the extra 40 odd minutes on the dvd, is even better.  there are scenes here that are so vital, so moving, and that add to the story in such a big way, i cannot believe that they were cut.  watching the film at over 3 and a half hours was an experience so involving so immersing i felt i was in middle earth. and the time just flew, it seemed like only an hour and a half went by. i cannot wait to see this in a cinema on a big screen. there is so much that makes more sense now, and the ending at helms deep is so integral to the book.",10,0,0,21 November 2003

If only more movies were as good.  two towers has such emotion in it that myself and the audiences i watched the film twice now with, were caught up so thoroughly and deeply. on top of that the greatest cgi character yet on film,  gollum, is so real and rounded as a character (where is the oscar nomination for best supporting actor).  and as one british critic wrote the two sides of gollum was so much better done than willem defoe in the dreadful spiderman.  i am writing this on the day the oscar nominations have been announced and it is a travesty that two towers has not received nominations in the main categories, jackson left out in favour of the much overrated scorcese for a not very good film.  but then the academy have always been dreadful at recognising real talent, their history shows only too often their ignorance of truly gifted people and films.",10,0,1,12 February 2003
The Elephant Man," one of the greatest films ever made
","i do not know why i have not posted a comment on this film before now. anyway better late than never.   i have seen the elephant man over a dozen times and each time i see and feel more.  john hurt and anthony hopkins are not my favourite actors, and to be honest hopkins was always brilliant till he got an oscar for one of his worst performances in the very bad silence of the lambs,  here however he is perfect, as is the rest of the cast.  the mood the music the look, all perfect. this film should be shown in schools all the time so that kids can grow up knowing what compassion, courage and true love are. we would be a much better society and it would be a much better world if we could live with even a fraction of the spirituality and love that is in this film",10,1,1,15 January 2004
I Am Legend," another remake gone bad
","so another remake, and yet again we are reminded that we live in a dumbed down age. all the complexity of the book and previous films gone, instead a two dimensional b horror movie. Heston's the omega man improved on the novel by creating 'the family', here robert neville has a worthy adversary, albeit a mad one. in legend they are super vampires who fly thru the air and growl a lot. much of the film's running time is wasted on pointless scenes that really do not add to the character or plot, the flashbacks with the family are utterly pointless, in the omega man, the end is logical and poignant, here it is meaningless, he really does not have to do what he does, (i will not say what it is, you will see when you see the movie, which by the way you should see on DVD, as its pretty much a waste of time and money to pay and see it in a theatre) by the way the screening i saw on Friday was far too loud, the film was far too loud, all noise and thunder no meat on them bones on a different note, i too have noticed the number of 10/10 votes this has gained, and judging from the fact people have voted and added a comment without seeing the film is pretty mind boggling , why is this allowed",3,12,33,10 December 2007
A Quiet Place," i know many have already stated the obvious but i just have to say dumbest movie ever
","I know i am repeating the accurate reviews that have stated how stupid this film is. peopled by charactes without an ounce of grey matter. worst of all, at no time did i care for anyone, or find any situation tense, as i was able to foresee every movement the family made, right from the start, i knew they would leave the youngest child to walk behind by some distance, what kind of parents just trundle off dont look back and let the youngest causually stroll along. there are over a dozen ways to kill the aliens, but the family are so thick they cannot thing of any. every department store has huge basements, which would be pretty much soundproofed, hole up in one of those, place speakers along the streets, blast the aliens with sound and knock them off by blowing their heads off, could not the military and government have come up with stratergies, what happened to all the helicopters, i could go on, but its all beend said, and to top it all of it was slow and boring",1,3,5,23 September 2018
The Dark Knight," a let down after batman begins
","like many other posts here, i was so looking forward to this having thought that batman begins was after the first two superman films the best comic adaptation so far. what a let down, i agree with all the folk that said the film has no plot is repetitous and without any depth. of course the critics are all going to be sheep again it has already started, wow how dark this is, this word has been so overused to describe anything thats not light and fluffy and has now lost its meaning. this film just does not engage in any emotional way whatsoever. in going for realism nolan has lost any sense of wonder and fantasy that the previous film had. that had proper comic book villains well portrayed, the joker here is one dimensional had a problem dad and now just wants to destroy batman and everything else. i think we have had quite enough of this villain, lets put him to rest. this was going to be my film of the year, but like so many others my anticipation was blown away by mediocrity, mr. nolan please take note of the negative criticisms here, these are written by true fans of you and your films so far you have delivered with your previous films but now seem to have gone astray. get your scripts tighter, the film was at least a half hour to long, and really had nothing to say or to entertain.",1,11,41,19 July 2008
La La Land," we need more people to give this a one to even up the ridiculous 10s
","there have been many posts that rightly knock this film, but i have to add mine, it seems the world has gone mad, politically, socially and culturally , if people think this is the best film of the year and some re saying the best film they have seen, then we must be in la la land. it is terrible from start to finish, bad songs, bad singing, bad dancing, bad, wait, no plot, no chemistry, no emotion. a flat, zombiefied, utterly dull film that is witless, pointless and a waste of time. along with fences and a few other 'award' films this joins the group of films that are not just overrrated but in reality go way beyond bad. it seems that the public reading all the over the top revues have gone in determined to like it, but there are a good many of us that can see through it, to these people if you have not rated it please do so now and give it a 1 rating to counter the ridiculous number of 10s",1,12,25,29 January 2017
Les Misérables," the music is the biggest let down
","For a film that is totally sung, you really need a good score, the music and lyrics in this is just plain bad. I love musicals grew up on them and all the best have songs you can hum instantly with clever and catchy lyrics. This is one big sludge through, could not remember a single tune, because all the songs were basically tuneless. the performers did their best, the sing song dialogue delivery just did not work, and took away any emotion. i cannot understand at all why certain people are breaking down crying during this emotion free slog. None of the scenes that should have brought a tear did anything of the kind. A brave attempt but because the central building block, the music, is soooo bad, all falls down.",3,3,9,18 February 2013
Thor," another wasted opportunity
","firstly the 3d conversion is utterly pointless, makes the film look very wishy washy, now to the main complaints, this is a film about a super hero, well, he is actually Thor for about 12 minutes in a two hour movie. the rest of the time is spent in utter drivel, too much time on the human characters, we see Thor fly and use his hammer in one short action sequence at the start and again another one at the end, inbetween is boring relationship stuff and not good comedy, the actors are great the look is good, but please just stick to the comics. another origins story that we do not need, i grew up loving Thor probably my favourite of the marvel heroes, and wanted to see him being Thor, for most of this movie he has lost his powers and is actually almost secondary to the story, who writes this stuff, why do we need all this backstory rubbish, Star wars showed that you could jump straight in and the audience will get it. what a waste",6,16,45,20 April 2011
The Matrix Reloaded," maybe not as good as the first but still pretty good
","I think most people miss the point, we were all nicely surprised with the matrix it was fresh mostly original and unexpected.  then there is a wait of 4 years, the hype grows, expectations are sky high, no film can live up to that.  i found reloaded great fun, brilliantly executed, there was a lack of humour, but overall from plot to action i had a great time, better than spiderman, xmen 1&2",7,0,0,2 July 2003
The Fountain," perfect combination of image, acting, music and style
","a film that divides view points, one that most critics in the US and UK and France seem to have derided, well almost all critics today are sheep anyway all agreeing on the same mindless pap most of the time. this films is rewarding on so many levels, it is classic cinema, the fusion of image and sound/music has not been bettered since 2001 A Space Odyssey that film too was derided by many public and critics, but like the fountain it truly uses cinema language to draw you in emotionally, intellectually and viscerally. not many directors today have the courage to pace a film as slow as this and yet for those who can see, draw the viewer into his incredible universe. the fountain has to be seen without prejudice, without thinking, and without distraction. give it your time and you will be amply rewarded, it is also not without humour and some wonderfully unexpected scenes, and by the end you are uplifted and indeed inspired",9,2,4,17 June 2007
The Departed," major let down
","what a let down, after all the fuss and rave reviews, the film is not a patch on the honk kong original. scorcese takes two and half hours to tell a very simple story that in the original had you tensed up all the way. here what we get is banal dialogue,(goodfellas again) implausible plot turns, (i'm trying to remember if infernal affairs plot was as ludicrous, take the fact that di caprio goes to see the police shrink, in the police building, what no ones sees him. the basic premise and point of the movie is when and how they are going to discover,each, it takes ages to get to this point, by which time i was bored silly with nicholsons way over the top performance, di caprio looked and sounded like he was about to cry any moment, but worst of all was that the film had no energy, it just sagged, this is now the third film from sorcese that looks tired, it started with gangs of new york, then aviator and now this, by this going, his next film will positively crawl to the end. overrated, overblown and forgetfull",1,62,104,19 February 2007
War of the Worlds," another overblown and ridiculous film from spielberg
","here we go again, Spielberg dishes up a half baked non-sensical film and critics and crowds go wild. there are so many major plot holes in this from start to finish that the whole film becomes a joke, for a start, by showing the events from an ordinary guy's point of view we are never in the action but always observing it from afar, our three lead characters are fairly boring and lack any charisma or sympathy. the son has to be one stupid kid to want to do the things he does, we last see him about to be blown up and lo and behold not only does he get to the grandparents house unscathed but it looks like its the only house not to have been touched by the tripods, also the mother and her parents are without a scratch. the whole film was just noise and bombast, oh and did i mention the mad tim robbins character who again has not purpose, and is rather mysteriously bumped off by cruise, why?? why indeed is the point of the film, everyone shoudl watch the excellent george pal version for real thrills and scares",2,0,1,17 November 2005
August Rush," a truly wonderful and magical film
","this is a one in a million film about love, music and faith, to all the users who have posted negative comments for this film all i can say is most of you have no idea about screen acting, the power of imagination, and what true cinema can do. firstly to those who wonder at the boys ability to play the guitar straight off or to be able to compose instantly, i will remind you of a certain W.A. Mozart who at the age of four years old went to his fathers harpsichord and started playing, he was composing by the age of seven, he like our hero here was a child prodigy, in the film they make this statement, so why is it hard to believe, there is a 7 year Japanese boy that plays guitar better than most bar band guitar players, he play a normal size guitar which is bigger than him he is on youtube, he is not alone. this film was beautifully acted brilliantly shot and with more heartfelt moments than i have experienced in many a long time. to those who hate a film like this, i say pity on you for a severe lack of imagination and emotion in your lives, to those of us that get it, august rush will always be a special film",Null,1,2,14 July 2008
Jaws," i have waited this long so that i could see the film again
","i have waited this long so that i could see the film again and see if it was as bad as i remembered it. it was far worse, one of the most boring films ever made. as with most Spielberg films the 'heroes2 or protagonist's are all pretty stupid, there were a million ways to kill of the shark, but they chose the most cumbersome and dangerous. i remember when i first saw it, first being utterly bored most of the time when nothing happens and we get scene after scene of crap dialogue and stories from not very interesting characters, then the shark appears and its so bad its like pantomime which in England is kids musical comedy with over the top and not well made props. it was so obviously not in the least bit real and even less scary. why people keep rating this film that has no scares or tension in it is beyond me. its like the Beatles myth, as the greatest band in the world it just keeps perpetuating, same as Spielberg being the greatest director of all time when in my view he is not even in the top 100",1,21,88,4 June 2010
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," most people are missing the point
","As he did with the Rings trilogy Jackson has greatly improved on the books, for those who criticise him for the big changes he has done, go back and read the hobbit again. it is not a great book, it spends more time describing places and things than it does in plot or characters, people are just mentioned in passing almost. There is no drive to it. Admittedly i think two films would have been sufficient, but at least we get to spend one last time in middle earth. yes there are flaws in this final part, and the battle is very scatty, but it also has some great action and the ending is truly moving, and of course it links very nicely to the fellowship of the ring. lets hope that Star Wars is able to fill the void for next Christmas,",9,4,10,22 December 2014
Hitch," good but predictable
","has anyone else noticed that in American romantic comedies the plot has always been the same. boy meets girl at first they spar, then start falling in love and by act three every time either one or sometimes both of them does something to the other one usually out of ignorance or a misunderstanding, they fight one tries to make up the other rejects the advance only to realise a little later that he/she was wrong and that this is it, to the inevitable happy ending. now i do not know of any romance that withing its first few days/weeks/months where the couple fall out, this starts happening after the honeymoon period be it six months or over a year. but Hollywood has used the plot development in every romantic comedy for the last ten years at least. when eva mendes publishes the cruel and untrue story about albert and hitch, it is totally out of character has no basis in fact, in fact her assumptions about hitch are not based on anything, so why should she do it. up to then i really enjoyed the film, even though i knew they were going to play the last reel in the way that they did. shame really that we no have all these set formulas for each respective genre. this is marketing not movie making. but the punters lap it up and keep lapping it up.",5,0,1,23 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," out with a whimper instead of a bang
","it is a terrible shame that Lucas could not have brought on board people who could write and a director who could direct actors. the script is worse than usual with every line a cliché, the performances vary from good Ian mcdiarmid (emperor/palpadine), Natalie portman (padme) to average McGregor (obi wan) to the bad Christensen (annakin). And there is the main problem as we are dealing with the demise of annakin and the birth of Vader, the actor needed to have gravitas and authority, poor Haydn has neither and struggles manfully to fill the body and shoes of Vader but does not succeed. i am baffled by the response by both critics and fans alike that this is the best of the new trilogy, for me it is the most emotionless. there was no sense of story or character, far too many battle scenes, the one on the wookie planet had absolutely no purpose other than to get Yoda out of the way. or maybe as someone said after the screening to capitalise on the merchandising. anyway i shall see it again to see if it gets better or not",4,19,41,10 May 2005
Inception," hopefully more people who rightly thought this was rubbish
","easily one of the worst films ever made, that some critics fell for it, just shows how bad today's professional critics have become. no doubt all the 14 to 18 year old Nolan fan boys are going to attack all of us, that have seen through this psycho babble non sense. ultimately the worst thing about the film is that it was utterly boring, from start to finish. at no time to you feel anything for any characters, the dialogue is of such a juvenile nature he must have got a 14 year old to write it. the guy has no idea of what dreams are what takes place during them, i will not go into any philosophical or psychological discussion here as the film does not warrant them, giving there is no sense in anything that is said or done. like dark knight this will have its time in the sun and in a few years the very same people who raved about it will wonder why. as for the ending with the top still spinning telling the audience that anyway it was all still a dream, totally makes the whole exercise futile. shame that a once good film maker has gone right up his proverbial",1,285,566,24 July 2010
Arrival," as bad and nonsensical as interstellar
","a supposedly sci fi film. NOT IN A MILLION YEARs, it is trying to be but fails on every level. first failure is that it is mind numblingly boring. now onto plot, aliens arrive, floating octopi, the authorities bring in a linguistic expert to try and commnicate. how does she do this, by writing her name on the board and repeatedly saying it. they reply by squirting ink that forms circles with flowery edges, this is their alphabet, in no time they can read our words, without going thru the alphabet, but by cards being help up, at one stage the physicist is walking with a card that says 'ian walks' this is how dumb it is. thats basically the sci fi part, the rest is about her daughter dying and her dealing with grief, throw in some very lame time shifting, the aliens and now our expert can see time non linearly, so she flits from past, present and future. all to do with her daughter. see slaughter house 5 to see how time travel should be done. the aliens are giving mankind a gift, i think it is supposed to be world unity, but they do not spend any time on this theme. not be any stretch of the imagination would a hugely advanced civilisation do any of the banal and ridiculous things these aliens do. most of the cast including jeremy renner as the physicist have nothing to do, amy adams mopes throughout the film saying i don't understand, and then suddenly unexplained she understand everything, the space ships the just literally disintegrate, everything goes to the past for Amy and the end. absolute rubbing that took two hours for nothing to happen",1,75,167,10 December 2016
Parasite," another way too overated film
","First off the film is half and hour too long, most of the dialogue is simplistic and repetitive. how it won best screenplay is beyond me. the film has no heart or soul, we do not care for the poor family, as they are all self serving, uninteresting and as the title says parasites. they go from bumbling incompetents to master con artists, as other have pointed out the rich family are presented as really stupid, unaware of what is happening around them. the ending was just silly and implausible, mind you most of the film was like that. like shape of water, roma and others the film seems to have hoodwinked critics and audiences alike into believing that this is some form of great social comment and insight. IT IS NOT whilst it is good that a film from Korea has won the plaudits this has, it is also very indicative of the times that everyone has read into the film, when really what they are seeing is just not there",1,38,68,11 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," At least the public knew to stay away from this
","A bunch of very good actors, all wasted in an indulgent pretentious script, and even more indulgent and pretentious directing. the pseudo arts use of a drum soundtrack, the long boring hand held tracking shot, oh look i am doing all this in one take. the absolutely stupid plot, that takes ages to go nowhere, a film where the film maker is saying very loudly and in a very boring way, look how clever i am, why this has been praised by critics is beyond me. Actually to be honest i have now long given up on what critics say and write about a film. Virtually critic on both sides of the Atlantic seem to have lost any sense of what is good or bad. The amount of critically endorsed films that i have thought to be not bad but very bad seems to be growing each year. i have been a serious movie goer for some time now. i also have noticed that after a year or so these lauded films seem to get reconsidered , where the original praise is vastly reduced.",1,775,1568,9 January 2015
Prometheus," pretty average and just a repeat
","Unlike most people i had no high expectations for the film, i am not a great fan of the first Alien movie, lots of howlers and scenes that did not make sense. The same goes here, people do stupid things to move the plot along and there are at least two maybe three completely pointless plot devices that do not add to the story or characters. Basically what you get is a great deal of walking around enormous and impressive sets and scenery, the film is a treat to look at, although Scott does nothing with the 3D potential it could have been much better. The plot is very thin with not much going on, and as for any serious philosophical theme there is none. After the first hour or so, you just want the film to finish, as really very little happens, there is an action sequence triggered off by a really bad plot device where a character assumed dead returns and is let onto the ship, by a very stupid captain. there are quite a few scenes reminiscence of Alien but not as effective. all in all a pretty underwhelming experience. Good to look at and a good music score which is why i give it a six",4,12,29,31 May 2012

Vanilla Sky," cameron crowe! join the ranks of the overratted

Vanilla Sky, is so lame and badly writtten, worse because it is a remake of a much supperior film made with ideas and talent and yet he still gets it wrong.  Never have i heard so many cliched lines delivered badly by all concerned.  The dream within a dream, could have made for great philosophical possibilites, but all we get are boring cliches, takes on love and how to get it and lose it. Scenes that go on and on and on, serving no purpose, rather they are embarrassing, almost all the scenes with Cruz are unwatchable, with trite dialogue, that thankfully is forgotten as quickly as its said.",1,1,6,29 July 2002
Iron Man," another bad start to this year's blockbusters
","beware spoilers from the very start. where do i begin to say how bad this film is, i thought that the scripts for the spider man and xmen film were bad, this makes those films look like masterpieces. the plot does not make any sense and has more holes in it than the yorkshire moors. nothing adds up or has any logic to it. our hero gets attacked and captured by taliban baddies, and is asked to construct his latest weapon for them, instead he starts constructing his firs iron man suit, right under their 24 hour surveillance cameras, with bits and pieces he makes a super nuclear powered suit that can fly, on his escape he conveniently leaves the detailed plans for the suit, he by the way, is established as a genius. he then notices that the weapons his company makes are all in the baddies camp, and wonders how they got there, once back in the USA he promptly forgets about finding out how and who is supplying his weapons to the bad guys. if they could get their hands on what stark industries make before even the company can get them out, why did they need him to build the new one. of course we then find out that his old mentor and the company guiding light is the bad guy, as if we the audience did not know that from the first second the character appears. paltrow is totally wasted in a bimbo role, the dialogue is trite and b movie standard. and worse was at the end of the show all the easily pleased audience applauded. total waste of time clichéd and predictable from start to finish",5,8,34,30 April 2008

Beowulf," dated and underwhelming cgi
","this is the year 2007 and yet the cgi in this film looks about ten years old, the character movements are stilted, the eyes have no expression in them, how come they can get it right in the kids cgi films that pixar do, and the great achievements of the Rings movies and King Kong, about more than half the cgi in here is pretty bad, if it were not for the 3d which mostly works i would have walked out halfway thru, the other major flaw in the film is the dreadful voice of ray winstone, who knows what accent he was going for at times he sounded like a bad peter o'toole and an even worse richard burton, and worst of all he did his trademark shouting every sentence, the best thing was the creation of grendel's mother the animation almost did justice to the beauty of angelina jollie and her voice was perfect, it goes without saying that the script was truly appalling even by comic book standards, all in all a pretty bad movie i cannot believe its rating is as high as it is, it should not be more than a 3",3,1,3,1 December 2007

The cast are all perfect all playing straight but also loose. I was worried when the title included the word Dark, used also for Star Trek into Darkness, but thankfully it relates literally to the Dark planet and the baddie who wants to turn the Universe from light to Dark. the humour was even better than in Avengers, and the cross referencing with the Marvel universe and characters was perfect, looking forward to seeing it again this time in 2d if i can find a cinemas that will be playing it on a large screen if not will wait for the DVD",9,35,72,29 October 2013

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," worth seeing at least a second maybe third time
","Well i waited to see it again before posting a review, and i am glad i did, after the initial concern that the plot was too close to episode 4 , on the second viewing it worked a lot better. i can see what they are trying to do, which is blending the folk lore from the original trilogy and then adding to it. i liked the fact that in the look and style they went back and gave a very realistic look in the sets and special effects, gone were the sterile and cold shinyness of the virtual sets and props from eps 1,2, 3. the humour returned and i think this sets up the next two eps very well. my only real complaint, and this is something i did not expect to want, is that it could have been longer. at both screenings the film just flew by, so its not a bad thing that we call came out wanting more, for all those that have said it is lazy and a repeat, go see it again with less expectations, i think you will get the emotion and fun that was intended",9,2,38,27 January 2016

","just seen an advance screening in the uk and read a review in empire magazine, where the writer obviously saw a different film, or just gave it 5 stars because its the Coens. this is a truly terrible, boring and pointless film, i have ticked the spoiler box, but really i don't think i or anyone else can come up with spoilers as there is nothing to spoil. i really bad central character that you could never ever have any sympathy with, not great supporting characters, with hardly any plot. this film goes in a complete circle literally ending where it started, so no sense or purpose to it whatsoever, just a total waste of everyone's time. what is so sad is to see pretentious critics go for garbage like this because of who made it. avoid at all costs",3,7,11,20 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," for all those who like this film, did you actually watch and listen carefully
","first of this is not a feel good but a very feel bad film. all the characters and i mean all of them are nasty and quite stupid. the elder brother constantly screws his younger brother and puts him in difficult and life threatening situations he stills the love of his life. the policeman, the quiz show host, the gangsters are all horrible and nasty people. everything that happens to the kid is tragic. the kid as a grown up is a gormless guy, who just wants his girl, neither he nor his brother aspire to anything, they just get by, by any means mostly foul and violent. the film is loud abrasive and the utmost in exploitation cinema. i think audiences today just go in leave their brains, if they have one, at the door and lap up what is in front of them. going along with critics, who today, have lost all critical faculties, just wait for when the DVD comes out i bet anything that critics who gave this film rave reviews will be more conservative on their appraisal, on a second views all its very many flaws and unbelievable implausibilities will come to light. a bad film in every way",1,4,7,30 January 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," without story or characterisation equals no involvement
","The first big problem with mad max is that Tom Hardy really is not a star, he has very little charisma, he is no Mel Gibson, next the character as written and portrayed is a bumbling, shuffling fool. The first 20 minutes he is a captive, so does not do anything, Mad max of old would never have been in this position. the film is one long repetitive, action chase sequence, all done quite well but by the end you are just numbed. The supporting cast especially Charlize Theron are all excellent,in fact she is more Mad Max than him, for stretches of the film Max is almost an extra or a supporting character. Hardy never conveys any emotion or depth, most of the time he looks confused, at the start when he tries to escape, its filmed like a keystone cops comedy from the silent era. A loud overloaded but not with the right contents big big disappointment . Yet again most critics have become blind fan boys.",7,34,92,13 May 2015
Alien: Covenant," utter garbage
","a very bad boring and uninventive rehash of the previous films, all the same beats, scenes and utterly stupid, boring characters, prometheus was bad this is worse, so called scientists and explorers get a distress call, and divert to a planet they did not know existed, landing there, yet again they take no precautions against any form hazard, and start to do the most ridiculously stupid things, resulting in a typical slasher movie, where they all die one by one. at least prometheus had some decent cast, here there is no one apart from Fassbender of any note, so they give you two Fassbenders to make up. as usual there have been a bunch of critics to give this rubbish good reviews, the same sheep that seem to like any old tripe that comes out of Hollywood these days, avoid this at all costs.",1,178,345,13 May 2017
