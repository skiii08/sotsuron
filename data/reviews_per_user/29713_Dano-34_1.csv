The Blair Witch Project," One of two true, unexpected masterpieces this summer
","In a summer where we have been given the sheer, ultra slick pseudo 'epic' movies 'Star Wars - Episode 1' and 'The Matrix', it needs to be truly noted the the best two movies of the summer, if not the whole year, are the low budget, inventive films 'South Park' and 'The Blair Witch Project'. Though not readily seen, 'South Park' shows the true level of hypocracy of the establishment, while 'Blair Witch' is truly a landmark of its genre, like the original 'Star Wars' or 'Pulp Fiction'. These two movies genuinely deserve all of the accolades heaped upon them, and I hope they are not passed over when the awards season comes around.",9,1,2,15 July 1999
