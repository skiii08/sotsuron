Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Itsa... howyousay.... vera bad!
","Before you think I just don't like the kind of humor presented by Sasha Baron Cohen in Borat, let me assure you that I absolutely loved his HBO series Da Ali G Show. I loved all of the characters including the Borat one. What I didn't care for was this horrible movie.It wasn't until the second half of the film that I even laughed out loud for the first time. The only scenes I found remotely funny were the ones in which he was at the religious revival and at the formal dinner in Georgia. Other than that, it was one big stinker. It is once again a classic example of the difficulty of translating a skit into a full-length film. The writing was horrible, the over-the-top attempts to be gross, and the poorly acted scenes littered between the staged skits made the film barely watchable.",5,5,11,7 January 2007
Ice Age: The Meltdown," So bad it hurts to type
","Conventional wisdom tells you to run from sequels... well, unless it is a sequel to an animated film like Toy Story. Conventional wisdom wins out with Ice Age 2. Now, before you think I am just not a fan of the franchise, let me say that I found the original Ice Age a very enjoyable film. This new one - not so much.Dave said it best when he pointed out to me that the first one had two levels of humor - the 3rd grade stuff and the adult stuff. The silliness and hijinx of the characters was visually funny as well. In IA2 The Meltdown, all of the adult stuff is gone or comes much later in the movie. (I have to admit that I quit watching after about 20 minutes... I just couldn't bear it anymore.) The kiddy humor is intact, but it is not slapstick comedy or even good jokes, it is silly faces on creatures and quite possibly the worst writing I have seen in years. The writing team of Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow are the masterminds behind that classic of comedy - Black Knight (and thats the good stuff.) These guys suck too much to be called bad.It doesn't matter how many high-profile, talented actors voice the words. When the words suck - the film sucks... and this one does.",1,6,10,20 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Not that Amazing
","Pan's Labyrinth was a total shocker. From the previews, I was expecting a fairy tale. I literally thought I was in for fairies, goblins, and all manner of fantastical creatures. Sure, there was some of that in PL... but this is no kids film.I was blown away by the sheer violence and gore. Don't get me wrong, I love a good bloodbath film, but this just seemed a bit too gratuitous. The story itself was okay, but in reality it was just a retelling of an old theme with added gore.One of the reasons I watch films is to be surprised... to not know what to expect... to have a film lead me somewhere as I follow engrossed in it all. The only thing that wasn't standard 'I know what comes next' fare were the occasional bouts of violence. I have seen both storytelling and violence handled much better.",6,3,7,19 February 2007
Cars," Cars ROCKS!!
","That's right. I have a new favorite animated/computer generated movie. Pixar's Cars is a great movie. Not only does it deliver a very fun film that people of all ages will enjoy... it does it with class and is visually stunning to boot. Just look at this animation! The CGI in the film is simply amazing. Over and over I was struck with how realistically things were rendered. The landscape was stunning, the physics of things like dirt particles/water etc. was breathtaking, and the cars were just too cool.Sure the story was simplistic and formulaic, but they used a good story and a good formula. I have never cheered a cartoon before... but I was completely caught up in the storyline and wanted desperately for the hero to prevail. There are not many films shot with real actors even that inspire that kind of emotion.My hat is off to Pixar once again for taking the bar previously set by themselves and raising it even further. That's right... my first 10 star rating of the year. In fact, it has been over a year since my last 10 star rating. (Sin City - April 2005) RATING 10 out of 10",10,0,0,24 June 2006
Munich," Don't F**K with the Jews!
","That's right - or they will hunt you down, kill you or make you sit through a looooooong film about hunting down and killing people. Seriously, that was one of the more memorable lines in Spielberg's new film Munich. And don't take this to mean that I didn't like the film or don't like Jews - its comedy people! I saw an opening and took it.I was actually surprised that it wasn't the story I expected. It wasn't about how hard life has been on the chosen people - it was actually about how hard the chosen people can be on their enemies. It took an honest look at how governments can make good people do bad things in the name of patriotism. (I am sure the timing is unintentional - right?) Spielberg delivered a strong tale about a pivotal moment in world history. He did with the honesty and he did it with fairness. Good stuff.",8,2,6,24 December 2005
