Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a good start
","Despite a truly menacing character in Darth Maul, a wonderful score by John Williams, and a terrific fight sequence among the Jedi (with the exception of how absurdly easy Darth Maul is eventually killed), this movie flops, fails, falls hard and couldn't get back up with a walker and a crane.Much of the final battle is waged between computer generated creatures that we couldn't possibly care less about, and the overall plot is weak and very thin. Plus there's Jar Jar Bings, a character so unforgivably bombastic and annoying that even the other actors seemed put off by him. Only Liam Neeson really puts his best into it, but even he was clearly uncomfortable with his decision to appear in this movie.Despite how much I loved and enjoyed the original trilogy, Lucas proves--with this film and 'Attack of the Clones' as well, if not more--that he's an overblown second-rate writer and probably the worst director there is. The only way I can explain the original trilogy is by looking at the credits, and realizing that--contrary to popular belief--Lucas actually had very little to do with the original movies. And if he's smart, he'll have very little to do with Episode III either.",Null,0,1,4 October 2004
The Notebook," Absolutely Beautiful
","I really don't understand what the critics were thinking as theywrote those reviews. The only thought that came to my mind is thatthey saw a different movie than I did. The movie I saw was to say inthe least, beautiful. Nick Cassavettes did a truly wonderful jobportraying Nicholas Spark's novel. Having read the novel, I thoughtthey did a superb job portraying it on the big screen, I couldn't thinkof a better way to do it. I don't know where this movie was filmedbut wherever it was, it was very beautiful, the visuals were justbreathtaking. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were perfect forNoah and Allie, these two will become huge stars. Some will say that the storyline is old and tired, but I definitely haveto disagree. While its been done before, its never been done thisway. With such depth and emotion, the predictable ending is nofault of the movie. You'll find yourself not caring, but only wishingthat you might come across such a beautiful love story of your own.",Null,11,18,4 October 2004
Wimbledon," Just what you'd expect, and less
","Formula all the way--and not even a slight plot twist to keep you guessing. The best thing I can say is that the tennis was realistic, and it didn't completely overpower what little plot was there. Kirsten Dunst is cute, but her character was undeveloped and she never overcame the meager story. Paul Bettany actually wasn't bad, but he was down two sets from the start with this disappointing movie.John McEnroe and Chris Evert were laughable--I've never heard such terrible, unrealistic tennis commentary from anyone (including them); we'd have been better served if they'd been played by actors (and whoever wrote their lines should be fined, if not banned from the game). I couldn't figure out if Wimbledon was a romantic comedy or a sports movie, but it fails either way. Don't waste a movie night on this one.",Null,1,3,4 October 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," 1ST CLASS PURE POPCORN ENTERTAINMENT
","Resident Evil 2 in a word... is 'good'. Compared to the recent rash of Zombie Movies out this century this is one of the best.It is better than the original RESIDENT EVIL film in terms of direction and visuals although the story was a little predictable, even if you have not played any of the games.The acting was so so, however Milla Jovovich's performance is good. I think it is about time she started acting in serious films and not JUST silly sci-fi kids films {as i recall she put in an excellent performance in Spike Lee's classic HE GOT GAME).This film does not have the intellectual punch of 28 DAYS LATER and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD nor the humour and irony of the forthcoming SHAUN OF THE DEAD. However you will find Resident Evil 2 much more entertaining than the dull remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD that came out a few months ago.This film does not try to be anything but pure entertainment...and it works. The film recognises that premise of Zombies taking over the world as being so far fetched and implausible that it is impossible to take seriously. So instead of trying to just shock you with gallons of blood and pig guts (like the Dawn Of The Dead remake} this gets a bit more shylock in its approach and gently laughs at it self and while trying to take you on an entertaining roller coaster of a ride.Resident Evil 2 is the 'HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and 13 GHOSTS of the zombie genre",Null,0,1,2 October 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME
","What a terrible movie. In every instance I could have told you two seconds before every zombie jumped out of nowhere with the director throwing in a loud crash that he was coming. Near the beginning of the movie, there were a dozen cops with tons of ammo and huge guns just mowing down zombies that are going slower than Bengie Molina after lunch, but somehow the main police character still manages to get bit; give me a break. And when that guy with glasses in the church freaked out and booked it, tell me you had no idea that he was going to get exed in about five seconds. Throwing in some senseless nudity and a few f-bombs (mostly coming from my favorite Mike Epps) to give it a more just R-rating makes it a true winner. This gets better than an F overall because it made me laugh more than any movie I've seen this year simply by being so",Null,0,2,4 October 2004
