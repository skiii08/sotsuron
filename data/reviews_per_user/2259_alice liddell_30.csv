The Blair Witch Project," A modern masterpiece: Blair's brilliance as much about filmmaking as terror. (possible spoilers)
","True story 1: When I was ten, I had a huge row with my mother, and hid out by dark in the local ramparts for six hours.  I was so traumatised, I didn't go out again for nearly a year.  True story 2: a couple of years later, out in the woods with some friends, we were shot at by the farmer on whose land we were trespassing.  They may have been fake bullets, but we didn't know that then.  True story 3: last June I was diagnosed for a cancerous tumour. It was treated successfully, but I was convinced I was going to die, and I'm only in my early twenties.  True story 4: Two days before I saw THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, I took my dogs out for a walk at midnight. I normally go with my wife, but she was tired.  I don't know the area at all, and after a few minutes I was lost.  It was foggy, with unlocatable voices everywhere, and I kept returning, with increasing panic, to the same place.  This lasted about an hour, the longest of my life.  No wonder BLAIR scared the living bejasus out of me.Why, you may ask, is a total stranger telling me all this?  Well, I've been trying to work out why a film everybody else considered boring or disappointing, truly, deeply terrified me into a dripping cold sweat, gauntly pale face, shaking, wrenching my fingernails.  A film about uncovering the past has made me reappraise my own.  Every day when I was in college, today in the streets, posters for Missing Persons, some missing for over six years.  A young neighbour of mine a couple of years ago went on holiday with some friends and mysteriously drowned.  I remember as a baby my dad would pretend to throw me off the ferry.  Richie Edwards.  I had never really given any of these events much thought.  I can't stop now.I wrote the above last night about 20 minutes after seeing the film.  I'm a lot less hysterical now.  Like Heather, I will take relative comfort in hiding behind the camera.  Because the film is as much an investigation into filmmaking as it is an exercise in terror.  It reveals the terrible fears behind the 'home' in home movie.  It uses modern critical theorisation undermining the 'objectivity' and 'realism' of documentaries, by showing subjectivity pouring into its form with a vengeance.BLAIR is obsessed with the nature of filmmaking.  Barely a scene goes by without some reference to the camera.  Some of this is rather obvious - e.g. the shots of the cameraperson in the mirror, or other camerapersons - but much of it is brilliant.  In films, even in fiction, we are used to the camera being our detached guide to everything we see - watching it fail so badly, so rigorously, helplessly under attack is terrifying, which is why I think the film affects film buffs more than others - BLAIR is nothing less than an attack on the presumptions of the medium.  The camera is as much a source of the fear as the unknown, as light reflected off the lens creates eerie, ghostly images.Even what seemed to be flaws add to the terror.  The continued attention drawn to the camera seemed contrived, but we needed it on for the film to continue.  Through the camera we become sadistically party to the threesome's pains - we dread them turning it off.  We are the watchers as much as whatever's out there.  The perfect editing beggared belief, until you begin to ask who actually edited this?  When Mike falls near the end, and Heather can be heard screaming in the distance, the camera moves again, and it's not Heather.  Who is it?  Mike said the witch models were too creative for rednecks.  Isn't the implication horrifying?  The well-documented manner of the film's creation actually increases the terror - the confusion over fixed authoriality mirrors the characters' bewilderment at who is the author in the film of the horrors.As in most horror films, there seems to be a fundamental misogyny at play. As Heather herself notes, the Blair Witch project was her project.  She is the Blair Witch.  She takes two ordinary middle class guys out of their American homes, and subjects them to the most ghastly horrors.  She controls every aspect of what they do>.  Another reason for the panic, though, is the complete absence of sex.  Only Josh refers to a partner, and he's the first to disappear. These are characters lost in the woods - that ancient metaphor for sexuality, especially female - and the subject never comes up.  Yeah right.  The camera never lies.But, most importantly, this is a basically terrifying film.  Three people, around my, and most of the audience's age, lost, without bearings, the reassuring signifiers of modern life, in a wilderness with threats both supernatural and primitive.  It's not quite as mysterious as PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK - we do know there's something out there - but for a $150m+ film to deny explanations or closure is remarkable.  The scene where Josh and Heather are suddenly awake, running after something in the distance, is probably the scariest thing I've ever seen in a movie, although the ending comes close.  The film begins with the characters leaving home and ends with them finding one.  Having been reduced to the most basic drives of humanity, parentless, lost, the pair rediscover childhood, in the form of bloody handprints.  I don't even want to think about that one right now.  Grrrgh. You probably won't want to see this movie - it's a different kind of scary.",9,1,2,27 October 1999
Vertigo," Detectives.
","No superlatives.  Detectives.  Sherlock Holmes - personally detached from crime.  Reads clues in the material world.  Navigates London, time and place can be read and contained.  Scottie Ferguson.  Obviously not detached.  He can't read material world because it doesn't exist, for two reasons: one, the world he sees has been created by someone else, a god/author figure, Gavin Elster, who like a good director gives Scottie a synopsis and a general idea of the plot, and then lets the actor (remember Hitch called them 'cattle') think he's improvising.Two, because even if the world wasn't an illusion, Scottie's vision is.  He cannot interpret what's in front of him, because he can't see it.  No more than any of us can.  Even before he begins the Madeleine/Carlotta chase, he first sees her at Ernie's, but not for what she is, a woman in a restaurant, but bathed in a strange, 'unrealistically' motivated glow.In Joyce's Ulysses, Stephen Daedelus distinguishes between Plato's  realm of 'formless' ideality, with Aristotle's more material philosophy, 'what you d--- well have to see'.  VERTIGO points up the shortsightedness of this viewpoint - Scottie sees what he sees, but it is a world of formless ideality.  But Scottie's love isn't an illusion - not only is it real and painful, but it is psychosomatic: his mental anguish is suppressed and comes out in his body, and he becomes catatonic.",10,5,7,12 April 2000
Vertigo," Self-revelation.
","VERTIGO reveals itself three times during the film - it encapusulates itself, shows us what will happen before it happens, future and past in the present - it interprets the future, but we only know once our experience (watching the film) is past.  The opening credits - lips, James Stewart; eyes, Kim Novak, into the eyes of woman, not as fleshly human being, but man-made illusion - vast, black, abyss, geometrical patterns which only repeat, visualising the labyrinth, the white pattern that looks like a shroud, the changing colours like Scottie's dream.The opening sequence.  Scottie chases criminal over San Francisco rooftops at night.  Scottie follows, criminal escapes, 'innocent' falls to death. Scottie, even when most in control, following someone else, being driven by himself.  Scottie follows Maddie the night after he rescues her, through the same old San Francisco streets, baffled.  She leads him to his own house, to himself.  Scottie, after he has made up Judy into Maddie, the circular kiss, the anxiety, the stable.",10,3,5,12 April 2000
Vertigo," Judy.
","No superlatives.  VERTIGO turns in one itself.  Yes it's 'about' cinema, about the male spectator especially, about the self-destructive passivity of active desire.  Like 'The Great Gatsby', its corresponding text in literature, VERTIGO  is about illusory lives, dreams, and the unattainable girl.  But VERTIGO complicates this.  VERTIGO is not told only from the point of view of Scottie, or the omniscient 'narrator'/director who subtly undermines him.  VERTIGO, unlike 'Gatsby', or 'Lolita', gives its heroine a voice.  We are allowed to see what she sees and thinks.  Scenes are coloured by her emotion, just as they are for Scottie.  See how they both visualise Ernie's, for example: Scottie's expansive, enquiring, free point of view and Judy's broken, Sirkian, experience, foregounding intruding decor and different levels, like shattered fragments.VERTIGO is Judy's tragedy - Scottie is actually offered a woman who will love him early, who will humiliate, negate, even kill herself for him; Judy loves someone who doesn't even know she exists.  But her Scottie doesn't exist either - like Heathcliff awaiting his Cathy, he is in another realm. Her cramped ordinary room for her is a suitcase, a wardrobe, a wallet, photos; for Scottie it is a magical, fairy-tale, substance-less cave, where once again time collapses, and talk of 'three years' is irrelevant.",10,3,5,12 April 2000
Vertigo," Prismatic (possible spoiler)
","No superlatives.  Bernard Herrman's score, Wagnerian, Liebestod, love in death, in love with death - Hitchcock called the film a story about a necrophiliac.  Yet lushly romantic too, as it totters, surges, jars and circles.Flowers - beautiful, but already dead, plucked, dressed in bouquets, withering, dead, like the yellow flowers at the graveyard.Images, almost mocking, throughout, of vertigo, the pans descending pans in Midge's kitchenette, the nocturnal shot of San Francisco that seems as if it has collapsed into the ground.VERTIGO is not one movie, but an endless series of diffuse narratives - for example, you could watch the film by just looking at all the paintings.
Midge, brassiere, suspension bridge, 'don't be so motherly' - sexuality, San Francisco and mother complex (grace a Luke Gibbons).The city as mind, compartmentalising of space, the inability to believe even what the 'normal' characters (Midge) say.  The Waugh-like inferno of Mozart.The use of religious iconography (the crucifix-avenues Scottie staggers away from after Maddie's fall; Scottie's chivalric quest coming to an end at Judy's hotel - twelfth (k)night, eve of the Epiphany, when Jesus revealed himself to the Wise Men - Scottie never makes it to the morning.The film's most rapturous scene, as Scottie and Judy walk by BRIGADOON-like glades and fountains and ruins, unremarked by either.  No superlatives. This film is the prism through which I view my life.",10,3,6,12 April 2000
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Weirdly dated, but still fun.
","There is very little, I find, more distressing than going back to films you loved as a child, and finding they weren't all that great after all.  For instance, obviously THE PHANTOM MENACE was an insulting atrocity, but I watched the revered trilogy beforehand, and found it - dare I say it? - a trifle monotonous.RAIDERS isn't that bad - Spielberg is a director, whereas Lucas quite clearly isn't - but it has insuperable flaws I didn't think possible from such a master storyteller.  It sets itself up as a non-stop rollercoaster in the vein of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but, unlike that masterpiece, it has very tedious longueurs, and lacks that film's use of plot as character study. The film's racism is also more of a problem than it might have been when I was five, although Nazi caricatures will never cease to amuse.  The period detail is virtually non-existent.  And the storytelling and direction seems very jerky at times.  It certainly lacks the depth and power of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS or E.T.This doesn't stop the film being a pinnacle of entertainment, offering a multitude of pleasures.  It is a very canny film, as if Spielberg had read a book on Hollywood narrative conventions, and decided to joyously stretch them to parody.  For example, when we first hear of Indy's old teacher and the woman he left with, we expect a classic Oedipal conflict, but minutes later we find out he's dead.  The hero/villain doubling is blatantly alluded to, as if to save us the bother.  The typical Hollywood reining in of an independent, resourceful woman is textbook.The usual course of the hero, with its obstacles and goals, is royally exaggerated: we can see Spielberg, a la Hitch, sadistically piling on the opponents  and life-endangering situations with a trowel, really putting Indy through it.  Each new difficulty is more dangerous, more complex, more ludicrous than the last, and yet Spielberg never lets down on the tension, never patronises his audience, as if he knows what we like, and knows that we know that he knows it, and are clever enough to know better, but craving escape enough to want it.The film has a complexity enough if we want to look for it.  Indy's archaelogical plundering is mirrored by Spielberg's cinematic parasitism: the film is loaded with references to the aforementioned Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Leone, Huston, Welles, Hammer Horror and many others.  There is, despite the racism, an implicit critique of Indy's activities, and the outstanding closing shot, a very brave, dispiriting ending for a Hollywood film, is as much an admission of Hollywood's conventionalising of magic.The Mcguffin of the Ark is brilliantly worked out, despite its patent silliness, and unlike Roger O. Thornhill in NORTHWEST, Indy does not mature, does not realise that human companionship is preferable to childish, egocentric abandoning of responsibility in favour of idiotic ideals that are none of his business.So what are we left with?  Set-pieces to treasure, even though we know them inside out.  A lovely, spunky heroine in Karen Allen (whatever happened to her?), that will be sorely missed in the rest of the series.  Terrific visual gags and witty dialogue.  That wonderful theme tune that seems to ironise rather than lionise its hero.  An amazing Harrison Ford performance, gruff, comic, romantic, yet fundamentally insular and unyielding.  The film's superb patterning, e.g. the fire motif, or the connection between the tarantulas on Indy's back at the beginning, and the Nazis on the back of his truck near the end.  A Gilbert and Sullivan loving Arab sidekick.  Worth revisiting than: I just found it a little dated.",9,1,2,30 September 1999
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Still one of the funniest films of all time.
","It's impossible for me to be objective about this film.  I know every scene and line by heart.  Not because I'm one of those ghastly Python nerds, whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did, and actually misses the joke, which is on them; they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon.  No.  I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often, it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity, which, as in so much Python did, is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of (i.e. surprise).Also, nostalgia value.  MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes, before I even reached double figures.  I gobbled up every programme, film and record in a space of a couple of short years, so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful, so I go all misty-eyed when I see it.  Bizarrely, we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher, who felt it was very insightful about Roman society.But no-one watches PYTHON anymore, except that dorkish clique.  My brother, only a couple of years my junior, is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then.  But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself, accessible to anyone who found the very male, elitist, academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating?How can I implore you to watch this?  It's got a straight narrative, with some of the greatest set-pieces and dialogue of any film ever.  It's not a great FILM comedy - Terry Jones is no Gilliam - but the style suits the humour perfectly, allowing it to breathe, and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot, such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus' sermon, and squabbling about petty things like big noses, and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland, with a massive Roman statue being wheeled, and a set of crucifixes being planted: a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history.This is the film's true triumph - it's a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion.  By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man, Python reclaim history from symbol and myth.  It brings the body back into history.  Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak, ironic conclusion (listen to 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' carefully, and in context: it's NOT comforting) - the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly.The intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing - the film is a learned commentary on power, totalitarianism, repression, language, gender, the writing of history, the politics of subversion, the complicity of the repressed.  Myth is thrown to the wind - the film succeeds where Reg and his revolutionaries fail, by revealing a whole series of repressive apparatum (sic?).  No-one is spared - the film is unashamedly destructive, but the film's satire is not arid or narrow; there are many rich parallels with our own time, as the extraordinary reaction from the religious on the film's release showed.But BRIAN is not just an attack on religion, but on all who would seek to write selective histories for their own interests, suppressing others' voices.  The silliest jokes are also the most profound - in one scene, the kidnappers enter Pilate's palace through a tiled floor.  They emerge through a modesty-concealing leaf painted on this floor.  This is snickering schoolboy humour, and very very funny, but is also a comment on the phallocentricity of imperialism.  Jokes like these are why BRIAN will always remain vital - it turns you into a ludicrous, ill-informed amateur historian.The acting is an astonishing feat of multiple performances, but Graham Chapman, always my favorite Python, holds the chaos together, ironically as the Kafkaesque hero who races towards the abyss, an anti-Jesus to love and identify with.  If I've made the film sound like hard work, than I'm an idiot.  The seriousness is only there if you want it.  Like Alice in Wonderland, or Buster Keaton, PYTHON seem to be full of metaphors that encapsulate the pains of life, but are also damnably entertaining.  It's strange that men as supposedly 'surreal' and 'out there' as the Pythons should speak such good sense.  Only BRINGING UP BABY, THE PALM BEACH STORY, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, are funnier than this.  Treasure it.",10,185,266,13 October 1999
Erin Brockovich," That mighty Soderbergh feeling.
","A sensible female detective film that is solidly based on plausibility (well, slightly, I'm sure most abandoned mothers would agree).  Plot perfunctory but fun, acting, especially Julia Roberts, a surprising joy. Main reason the film is a must, of course, is Steven Soderbergh, catching up on Tim Burton as America's greatest director, here enjoying flexing his considerable creative muscles in a populist woman's picture - his 'cubist' editing; his sense of the wide American outdoors and minutae of domestic life (in a hilariously Hollywood version of the working class); his sardonic visual jokery (those skyscraper shots); his continued interest in parents and children (see THE LIMEY, THE GREEN ROOM); his refusal to patronise his heroine.",7,0,2,26 April 2000
Fight Club," A film that might talk the talk, but stumbles when it tries to walk.
","Cowering under the shadow of Kubrick, this film is terrified of its own implications, and so emasculates them by a ludicrous twist; an act of creative vandalism as serious as the framing device in THE CABINET OF CALIGARI.  Investigation of social malaise reduced to whinging male angst - like we need more of THAT.  Brave initial incoherence and fragmentation jettisoned for plot and convention.  Fear of women the real problem - anti-capitalism a childish, major-studio-sponsored joke.  Brilliantly funny, though - works best as harmless black comedy.",6,1,4,8 December 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Swearing makes the world go round.
","Whether it's something to be worried about or not, I don't know, but American live-action films rarely emulate the wit, invention and versatility of their animated counterparts.  Even so-called lesser efforts like HERCULES are magesterial compared to bloated Hollywood extravaganzas and enervating indies.  The best of the modern live-action films, such as RUSHMORE, owe much to the freewheeling ethic of cartoons such as THE SIMPSONS.All of which is to say that SOUTH PARK is easily one of the best films of the year.  Again, I don't know whether this is a good thing.  One truth is self-evident: it shows up the bow-legged unfunniness of most 'comedies'.  I was a bit worried going in because the second series of the TV show showed signs of desperation and flagging ideas, but this was a hoot.  I nearly choked on my sweets, and twice spat my drank on the person in front.Its pleasures are many, but most satisfying of all is its consistent adaptation of a young boy's world-view.  The satire of THE SIMPSONS would be way over Bart's head, but everything here is exactly how a Cartman would see the world.  Everything is flat and two-dimensional; noise and immediate sensation predominate; cartoon (!) violence and swearing are joyous pleasures; the efflatus of modern life is only half-gasped (homosexuality, oncoming puberty, Sadaam Hussein is the devil's lackey etc.); and, most importantly, mothers are the cause of all the trouble in the world, their domestic tyranny transposed to a global scale.  And yet this focus does not limit the film's blistering, savage satire, anymore that Lemuel's point-of-view softens Gulliver's Travels.The moral of the film is perversely reassuring.  Swearing makes the world go round.  This isn't just a facile rubbing of conservative noses (although the thought of this is very pleasing) - the idea that the socialisation of children only leads to emotional damage and social chaos is one with a long and noble history.  The annoying thing about this film is its pompous arrogance - if you agree with the film-makers, cool; if you don't, you're a reactionary lunatic.  The great thing about the film is that it belongs to no-one.  Everyone is offended, crucially: though censorship is ridiculed, viewers are shown to be influenced by what they watch; though army racism is attacked, one of the black characters still talks like an extra from GONE WITH THE WIND.  No-one is ever allowed to feel comfortable - conservatism and political correctness are shown to be cosy bedfellows.And yet, the truth is that, despite exposure to 'offensive' material, and potentially traumatic experience, the children remain blissfully innocent. The film's achievement is to show that a set of signifiers (e.g. swearing, obscure female body parts) are of little effect unless they are accompanied by the knowledge to use them practically.  Cartman and co. get fun from swearing because they know it annoys their elders, not because they're offering conscious transgression.Formally, the film is much more graceful than you might expect.  The big screen is perfect - the prodigious detail of SOUTH PARK  is often lost on TV.  The colours and 'simplistic' animation are a constant delight, both comically and aesthetically.  The musical numbers are hilarious and clever in themselves, but also brilliantly choreographed - this is the best Hollywood musical since CABARET.  There is a stunningly conceived and very frightening vision of hell (beware Hitler!  George Burns!  Gandhi!  Jar Jar Binks!), which is immediately sent up.  The climactic battle is a model of crowd composition and meaningful imagery.  The pace, while it never matches the stunning opening and Terrence and Phillip film sequence, rarely flags.What SOUTH PARK will be remembered for, though, is its sidesplitting, offensive, how-the-hell-did-they-get-away-with-that sequences of genius (and it's really tiresome hearing blase bores saying 'What's shocking about it?' Name one film in your local multiplex one tenth as daring): Terrence and Phillip's sublime 'Uncle' song; the Satan and Sadaam relationship; Kyle on the Net; Cartman's V-chip; Mr. Mackay's rehab group; Big Gay Al's show for the boys - they just keep on coming, we can't stop laughing.  One quibble - for all its gratuitous swearing, there is one epithet that even Parker and Stone can't seem to handle.  I wonder why.",9,4,4,7 September 1999
Chicken Run," So-so.
","Good things about 'Chicken Run': genuinely feminist; even more genuinely socialist (in an Old Labour, let's-all-help-each-other-out kind of way).  It magnificently mocks hollow American bluster, and its animated style is refreshingly different, if stilted, in a world of Hollywood conformity.Less good things: formulaic plot.  Dearth of interesting characters. Insularity of vision.  Average, rarely hilarious dialogue.  Gleeful luddism. Island mentality, unironically referred to as reward.  Hackneyed aping of Alan Bennett sans humour or pathos.  Very British.",6,0,2,14 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Not the best film from the greatest director we have, but still towers above everything else.(possible spoiler)
","Richer than it appears on a surface level, this is still a bit disappointing from the director who gave us the greatest film of the last 20 years.  It is not immediately apparent what is lacking.  Burton's visual style is as ravishing as ever, if not as expansive - sometimes it feels as if he is working on a smaller budget than usual.  Part of the joy of Tim Burton is that, like you, he has seen the wonderful imaginative possibilities of Roger Corman and Hammer Horror foundered by a lack of money to see them through, and is determined to rectify this.The muted Gothic of the dusks, the forests, the late-eighteenth century mansions and towns, the austere churches, the horses, the villagers, the public rites, are astonishingly evocative, much more so that the rather perfunctory special effects.  Even better are the stunning dream sequences - a mixture of gleaming white, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS-like pastel and emotion, snatches of lurid red, dream and violence - that are among the best things Burton has done.The actors have been criticised for favouring caricature over character, but people forget that what made the figure of Edward Scissorhands, say, so moving was not Johnny Depp's performance, which, if taken in isolation, was rather stiff and unyielding, but Burton's visualisation of Edward's emotional subjectivity, like a great melodramatic director, though colour, composition, set design, and camera movement.  The failure is not Depp's performance, which is often amusing, but Burton's inability to anchor it expressively.SLEEPY HOLLOW is quite brilliant at undermining its surface narrative. Washington Irving's tale, and the book it derived from - 'The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon' - is often seen as the starting point of American literature, and cultural ideas about the notion of America, as it struggles to free itself from the dead weight of Europe.  Burton's film, 200 years on, has the opposite vantage point, at the end of these notions: he knows how they have developed, and what they have led to.  He has also open to him tools never available to Irving: e.g. Freud, Lacan, Derrida etc.So, on one level, the film deconstructs the creation of American history, dramatising a prosperous, seemingly self-made, professional nation at the mercy of both the returning repressed, and the unbreakable codes of Europe. This is seen most clearly in its treatment of women, in the obscene gap between Ideality and reality.  The only unadulteratedly positive female in the film is a murdered dream figure.  Crane is quick to demonise Katrina as a witch whenever he can't rationalise a problem; ditto Lady Van Tassel, whose grievances are just, and whose oppression is firmly rooted in European feudalism.This demonising can be seen as the fruit of Crane's movement from scientific rationalist into a supposedly religious society riddled with pagan superstition and fear.  The move to America from Europe has only resulted in the transplanting of the old Ideas - the murders concern either land or sex. And yet, paradoxically, it is the conservative entity of the family that suffers most, representing the conventional society Lady Van Tassel wreaks merry havoc on.One of the film's dominant metaphors is that of seeing, perception.  Crane is a scientific detective (a lovely joke: the man who earns his living using his head investigating the Headless Horseman), arrives in Sleepy Hollow with new-fangled, self-created tools which include elaborate machines for improving what he sees.  This allows for greater accuracy in studying the dead, the past, but as the legends of Sleepy Hollow begin to prey on his mind, allied with the demons of his own past, Crane becomes less able to see with scientific detachment.With all the scenes of Crane in bed, and the attendant implications of dreaming and madness, as well as an increased hysteria in the action, the status of what we see - is it truth, or just Crane's colouring of reality - is called into question, making even more ambiguous Irving's rather facile ironies.  Burton makes sure not to show us the murderer at the beginning: it doesn't materialise until Crane has heard the legend.This ambiguity is largely achieved by completely changing the character of Ichabod Crane, a teacher in the tale, not a detective; someone who passes on tradition and learning rather than uncovering it; someone so susceptible to the supernatural that he actively seeks it out, both by studying it, and by listening to old wives' tales.  Irving's Crane is far from a hero: physically grotesque, cruel, sadistic, greedy, cowardly.  Depp's Crane is more fastidious than a wuss.  By using the figure whose role is to find, see and interpret, Burton is better able to undermine him.What confirms the doubtfulness of what we see is Crane's Oedipal confusions, his idealisation of a mother, who was killed by a brute, bible-bashing husband; and Katrina, who is constantly linked to her - he rejects her when she refuses to be as passive and ideal as he would like, becoming an artist and director with her Evil Eye.  The two women murdered have maternal association - the widow murdered with child, and the midwife: examples of fertility and corporeality that threaten the ideal.For Crane is a virgin, and is terrified of real, sexual women - the profusion of blood squirted on him; the visual play of red and white; his only illusory ability to cage the bird (traditional emblem of female captivity), compounded by its red setting.  Lady Von Tessel only becomes the villain after Crane sees her having illicit sex, her maiming herself both a Hester Prynne-like mark of her sexual sin, but also proof of her own sado-masochistic control of her body and sexuality.This so offends Crane, and the new America he represents, that he must cast her out, link her to death and castration (the Headless Horseman), to perversion of nature (the extraordinary Tree of the Dead, Munch-like in its harrowing grief).  As with all his great films - BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD, MARS ATTACKS! - Burton uses the perceived detritus of its popular culture to express profound disillusion with the nature of America.  A brilliant, honorable failure.",6,0,1,12 January 2000
The Beach," I don't think so.
","The IMDb guidelines ask users, quite rightly, to refrain from gratuitously nasty comments.  I have to admit that, mildly speaking, I did not enjoy THE BEACH.  Suffice to say, the film's eagerness to adopt the DELIVERANCE/APOCALYPSE NOW/TAXI DRIVER mantle was compromised by its anti-septic, travel-brochure prettiness; that its megastar centrality resulted in play acting psychosis, rather than a disturbing embodiment (compare with Martin Sheen in APOCALYPSE NOW, for example); and that the film's fetishisation of youth's golden surface dazzles its professed aim of exploring its sinister undercurrents.  Boyle-MacDonald-Hodge once made TRAINSPOTTING; I hope they may do so again.",1,1,4,22 March 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," Better than Shakespeare (possible spoiler)
","This is a wonderful, funny, romantic teen comedy that may not be as laugh-out-loud uproarious as AMERICAN PIE, but whose drifts into seriousness and sentimentality are far more plausible and acceptable.The film is at least the second modernisation of Shakespeare's The Taming Of The Shrew, but is much less objectionable than the Bard to its title character.  Surely it will soon become a commonplace that Shakespearean makeovers are more successful than actual dramatisations.  The advantages for the scriptwriter are legion - characters with a ready-made set of characteristics; forward moving plots etc.  But the exercise never feels contrived here - characters may be named Stratford or Verona; one goth-hippy worships Will; the wired Bruno Kirby-a-like may spout the odd Bardic tag - but the rich inevitabliity of the plot allows for many themes to be touched on.An adherence to this plot allows for some narrative surprise - for instance, Shakespeare, unlike most mainstream films, rarely begins his plays with his heroes, so it's a surprise when nearly ten minutes are spent introducing a character in the conventional Hollywood manner (past history; explanatory friend; introduction to him of other characters etc.), that it comes as a pleasant surprise to discover that he's only a subsidiary character after all.This non-claustrophobic opening out applies to the film as a whole - although the relationship between Catherine and Patrick is clearly central, there is an even-handed treatment of secondary characters, not just plot enablers, but with problems and plot crises of their own, that makes the film seem so rich and alive.Shakespeare's big theme is the mask, the roles we are forced to play in life, how we are fixed by how others see us, how this can lead to emptiness and perversion in our own nature.  10 THINGS is a brilliant essay on this, the adolescent battleground of reputation being the perfect place to test it.  The theme is stated right from the start with Cameron, whose army-background means that he is starting at a new school for the ninth time.  This accumulation of continually inchoate selves, the sense of the itinerary and the unfinished, plants seeds of ambiguity and doubt into a mechanically constructed plot of elegant closure, undermining the outcome not only of Cameron's subplot, but Catherine and Patrick's too (although not the pleasure we derive from such outcomes).The main issue of reputation centres on Catherine and Patrick.  The former is a very hostile, intelligent young woman, exasperated with her jock contemporaries and the fetishisation of shallow values.  It may seem misogynistic to suggest that these very valid objections are just a smokescreen for the usual fear of sex, but it's not neccessarily sex per se Catherine rejects, but the egotistical male-gratifying power games that seek to put her in a very inferior place.This is a marked improvement even on Shakespeare, and the resolution of her plot is not a climb down, but actually enabling, couched in terms of possible creativity and independence, as Patrick gives her a guitar to form a band, something she earlier said would annoy her dad.  This is a uniquely open ending - she has already ruptured family ties by accepting a college place on the East Coast - what if she actually does form a band?  If she doesn't, will Patrick follow her to Saint Laurence?  Will she outgrow him?Remarkable in a Hollywood movie, the male lead exists mainly to  reflect and extract elements of the female lead's character, to push her plot.  And yet it is his plot that distills the conflict between what you are taken for, and what you do.  We aren't told until near the film's end over the 'truth' of Patrick's life (after all, we only have his word); up until then, we are forced to hold in tension the seeming connection between his actions (going out with a girl to make money) and his negative reputation, and its opposition to his likeable personality and evident desire.  This ambiguity casts further doubt on the ending.The rest of the cast brilliantly mirror this theme, from the staid careers officer who writes erotica, to the hipster teacher who loves Shakespeare. The film's very existence is called into ethical question by the discussions on the exclusionary literary canon.Because it parallels a second interesting tension in the film, one of class. As in AMERICAN PIE, every character is fantastically rich, with huge houses and their own cars, all except Patrick, whose reputation is rooted in a criminal underclass.  There is a tacit contrast between haves and haves not, conspicuous consumption and the disturbingly unknown that is quite surprising in such a good-natured comedy.And it is scrupulously good-natured and fair.  All the secondary characters are given depths and insecurities, even the silliest (Joey), while the blossoming of Bianca from a trivial beauty into a very complex, self-aware young woman is one of the film's great achievements.  The fairy-tale school setting adds to the 'unreal' flavour of the plot, as do the snatches of Surrealism (playing golf into an American football sportsground; the scene with the marvellous Stratford dad doing his exercises).The humour is remarkably clever and verbal, easily co-existing with the expected slapstick fun.  The Shakespearean use of ritual spaces (eg Prom Nights) for the playing out of social anxieties is compelling, as is the wonderfully uncontrived gender reversal in the expected fight.  The invasion by an army of  drunken students of a huge upper-middle-class home has the right degree of terror and exhiliration.  A real treat.",8,0,0,22 March 2000
American Pie," Sweet? Inoffensive? Sentimental?! What IS happening to the gross-out movie?
","I'm sorry.  I go to gross-out movies to see a mounting series of disgusting, childish mishaps befall relatively pleasant characters.  I want to see scenes that should probably never have been allowed.  I want humiliation, body failure, slapstick and the obligatory liquid scene.  This AMERICAN PIE provides in mild-mannered spades.  What I don't want is maturity and Prince Hal.It could be argued that THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, last year's Hollywood masterpiece, leavened its gross-out with generous portions of ick, but a love quest was built into that film from the beginning, the success or failure of which was going to have an emotional effect.  Also, the characters were significantly older than the kids of AMERICAN PIE, so the pay-off was more believable, and because the characters were so sweet, more satisfying.AMERICAN PIE is about a quartet of hormonal boys who want to get laid before they go to college.  As 49% of the population experience this agony at some time in their lives, the film has to be pretty accurate in its details to succeed, and it largely is.  The guys are very likeable and believable, their mishaps ring very true.  Their worldview shapes the film, and is rarely betrayed.  The film, which everyone compares to PORKY'S, is miles above that infantile gag in its relatively even-handed treatment of women, who are not the inscrutable, unattainable, type, but a varied, complex lot. Even the set-piece with Nadja, which begins as sheer exploitation, ends up with the male lead deeply humiliated.  The universal implications of the title are a wild misnomer: it should have been called Upper-Middle-Class American Pie.  Every character lives in a big house, with no real dysfunction, so that they can afford to spend all their time fretting about sex (I'd forgotten how much EFFORT goes into this, though).  Every character is going to college; every main character is white.  An AMERICAN PIE from the projects would be a very different film.For a comedy to be lastingly funny, there has to be trauma.  That's why the mature angst of one couple strikes me as false.  The growing relationship of another is lovely, but unlikely: it's like gross-out films lack the bottle to go all the way - the repulsiveness has to sweetened.  The Farellys tried with KINGPIN, but were accused of misogyny, even misanthropy.  Only SOUTH PARK dared to go all the way, cynically parodying feel-good redemption, But, hey, that was only a cartoon, right?  And yet, even the maturity is a lie.  The characters learn that a selfish obsession with having sex is not the most important thing in life, and yet they do anyway.But I don't know why I'm carping.  AMERICAN PIE is a side-splitting hoot from start to finish.  LIke all the best comedy, the humiliation is linked to character, and Jim's experiences especially are among the funniest things I've seen in years - the practicing; the understanding talks given by his father; his immortal strip-tease; the pie!  Priceless.  Shame he looks like a cross between Ross Geller and Adam Sandler.A more satisfying melancholy concerns the allusions to Hal and Falstaff. Like the former, the characters have big careers in front of them, and must reject the exuberant licentiousness of their youth.  There is a real sense of loss at the end, of a time having certainly past, which is perversely moving.  Most adult figures condone, even encourage, the teenage hi-jinx: they know it's as good as it's going to get.None of the misfortunes really spring from malice, so there is rarely a bad taste left in one's mouth (except Stifler's).  Director Weitz could become a great comedy director - he knows how to cut scenes short for maximum effect: more experienced comedians drag on and on.  My only complaint would be the relatively short space allocated to Finch - he is a wonderful character, filled with a strange, devious self-confidence behind his apparent geekiness: you've got to like a guy who can wisecrack in Latin.",8,0,0,13 October 1999
American Psycho," Pretty much as you'd expect.
","If you were to make a satire of the American 80s, that infamous, hollow, bombastic, ultra-materialist, cruel decade, how would you do it?  Would you have a male hero, in this decade of Rambo, Arnie and Gordon Gekko, where even women wanted to be men?  Would you fetishise minimalism - elaborately tiny meals; shiny apartments with hardly any furniture etc. - to emphasise the spiritual emptiness of the decade?  Would you foreground the most ghastly, soulless, manufactured music to demonstrate the assembly-line reduction of emotions?  Would you mock the obsession with restaurants, big suits, vanity products, the mimicking of a 20s aristocracy sieved of all Gatsbyesque romance; where new, utility products don't make life easier, but serve to alienate you further from you 'loved' ones, your peers, your surroundings?  Would you show how, beneath the civilised sheen, the most barbaric ritual rites retain (and I'm not just talking about the serial killing)?  Would your hero be so obsessed with appearance, image (lots of mirrors and reflections), fitting in, that he would cease to be himself, that he would be alienated from himself, that he would become a literal double of himself with nothing inside?  Would you show the abuse of marginal figures such as the homeless?  Would you compare all this to the obscenities of the Reagan era?Sounds easy, doesn't it?  And that, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, is the problem with AMERICAN PSYCHO - it goes for the easy option every time.  It is no excuse to argue that the film is thin and superficial, that its satire is far too broad, because so was the decade.  By making this American psycho so ridiculous, so harmlessly, buffoonishly camp; by making the kind of emasculated satirical swipes a Republican might enjoy; only evades the true moral decadence of the era.The device of suggesting that everything that Bateman does is a mere projection of his fantasies, in the way the whole decade was a paralysing projection of materialist fantasies, goes back at least as far as LAURA, but whereas that classic tried to deconstruct the image of the police detective, and the very real authority invested in him, Bateman is just a dork, as everyone says.  He is too silly to be scary, his social position isn't adequately delineated to make him powerful.This in itself is satirical - what DOES Bateman do to make so much money? Is he really daddy's boy, or just another wannabe vice-president among dozens?  Why does he pick his particular victims?  In Paul Allen's case it's clear enough, immature envy.  But why prostitutes and the homeless (echoes of Bunuel, Kubrick, Ferrera)?  Because they refuse to conform to the glorious 80s ethic, they don't want to fit in like he does, they give the lie to his era's self-confidence?  Because they exist on the margin, as he would truly like to?  But he is as 'unproductive' and marginal as they are. Donald Kimball is set up as some kind of doppelganger (the film seems very indebted to Poe; or is this a nod to 80s academic theory?), but this kind of disintegrates as the plot breaks down, presumably to mirror its protagonists increasing madness.The style is as anonymous as its subject - again, correspondence between form and content isn't really enough; CLAIRE DOLAN has shown how the evocation of a soulless environment can be made critically meaningful. The lack of budget deadens the impact of the action hero climax.  If the film has a saving grace, it is the performance of Christian Bale, effecting, for some reason, an excellent impression of Jim Carrey, doing what he can to wring laughs from the predictable material (the BEN-HUR-like threesome is hilarious).  I watched DRILLER KILLER after this, a real American psycho whose trauma is rooted in an emotional crisis Bateman can never have because he is, as he says, a cipher.",3,2,6,7 June 2000
American Beauty," I'm afraid not.
","Can I please say, without contravening the IMDb guidelines, that this was a big, big disappointment, especially as the emotional response the film had generated had promised great things.  For about two thirds of its length it works well enough as a rather obvious comedy, but the complacency of the acting, the caricaturing of its female characters, the diffident direction that never masters the hardly original script all disappoint.  This sort of thing has been done with far more perceptively, and with far less pretension by the likes of Hitchcock, Sirk, Lynch or Burton (never mind the extraordinary RUSHMORE).  The next time you've got an astonishing, life-affirming (that's a laugh!  Facing up to adult problems too difficult?!), once in a lifetime film, make sure you do.",Null,1,2,17 February 2000
Being John Malkovich," 'Shall we to the boudoir' cracks me up every time - two-thirds masterpiece (possible spoiler)
","To call this film 'Bunuellian' is to flatter its political engagement, because this is literally the product of a culture that has turned in on itself (to speak politely), but you can see the point: Craig is a heterosexual monster with 'artistic' (bourgeois?) trimmings, whose hairy slovenliness signifies the retreat into bestiality of his zoo/home, where he locks his wife in a cage, and 'rapes' his/her loved one by pretending to be someone else (twice over). This is dangerous, dark stuff, and the film's punishment of Craig - he is forever trapped in the body of a child, doomed to watch the happiness of the two women in his life - lets us off the hook in a way Bunuel never would, and it might seem a bit hard to take a happy ending celebrating a world where men aren't necessary from two (very successful) men; but the film is terrific fun, civilised in its mind-bending misanthropy/optimism, even if, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, it kind of loses it in the last third,",8,1,3,5 April 2000
Duck You Sucker," Leone's most moving love story.(possible spoiler in last paragraph)
","Leone's most audacious exercise in parody is also his most sincere.  Never has his treatment of subject matter been so apparently flippant - two larger than larger than life heroes, one sounding like a rump-scratching Hispanic Clouseau, the other offering a splendid take-off on Welles' more hesitant blarney; ludicrous extensions of narratively marginal scenes; jokey effects undermining solemnity (especially when Sean becomes Juan's ministering angel, a day-glo celestial banner above his head); Morricone's most daringly inappropriate score, jaunty 'Sean Sean!' theme, plenty of silly, bathetic, intrusive noises, a gloriously disrespectful impromptu variation on EineKleineNachtMusik in the middle of a heist.As ever with Leone, though, the key to his film's soul is Morricone's music, and amidst the sarcastic invention and absurd kitsch, there beats a reluctantly sentimental heart.  Leone's films are full of tension, contradiction and disruption, and A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE is no exception - characters who are plausible and motivated in one scene, may be allegorical, abstract or merely the butt of a visual joke in the next.  But here he has created two of his most believable and likeable characters.  This is some coup in that one is a murderer-rapist and the other is an IRA terrorist, but their burgeoning friendship and sublimated romance provides an oasis of humanity in a desert of chaos, murder, war, fascism, betrayal, rupture, dislocation.Leone's films have been called camp, and this is a flamboyantly gay film, from the fetishisation of uniform and costume (Coburn, possibly the only actor in the history of cinema completely at ease in his masculinity, is as beautiful as ever here, long, loose and lovely in white and boots, a bondage merchant in a sweaty oater, an outrageous moustache amplifying those incomparable horse-teeth when he breaks into the Coburn smile).  And while these values, in league with Leone's mocking filming, undermine the very macho generics, the insufferable authenticity of 'war' and 'revolutionary' films, the sombre love story anchors the film's humanity.The only heterosexual sex in the film is an offscreen rape, and initially Juan's earthy, diffuse fertility is contrasted with the abstract, literally destructive, steely sterility of Sean - this is visualised in the treatments of their respective pasts - Juan's is embodied in his very visual offspring; Sean's consists of heightened, dubious flashbacks.  These, bathed in lush soft-focus, seem to indicate a MICHAEL COLLINS-like disrupted love story with a lovely Irish redhead, but the blatant homoeroticism of these scenes subverts their narrative of betrayal, conflating the individual and the wider political as Leone does so brilliantly often in DYNAMITE.  The development of Juan and Sean (ironical doppelgangers?)'s friendship is marked by a lot of phallic gunplay.DYNAMITE is Leone's most persistantly undervalued film, and it is true that in comparison to his previous film, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, it is a failure, with a less compelling narrative; less controlled style; less fully worked out mythic structure; less sense of space and place; but WEST is the greatest Western ever made, and DYNAMITE is full of brilliant things too. It is often accused of being a sprawling, unfocused mess, but look at Leone's formal genius in the opening scenes. Our first shot is of Juan, a comical figure in his shifty dishevellement, walking barefoot in the parched landscape, evidently animal, comically subservient to the driver with his hidden sandwich against his sweat-drenched belly.  In the next sequence, however, this prejudice against Juan belongs to the grotesque reactionaries, and we find ourselves horrified at our dangerous superficiality.  This may not be one of Leone's most subtle scenes, but it is overwhelmingly, savagely powerful, the vicious contempt of these forces of order distorted into a dizzying montage of chewing, phlegmy mouths, spouting poisonous hate, ignorance, suppressed sexual-desire, and crumbs until they become the indistinguishable bestial mass they condemn.But just as we side with the patronised peasant, he becomes the ruthless leader of a straggling group of bandits (including his trigger-happy pre-pubescent sons), unafraid to casually murder and rape.  DYNAMITE is full of patternings like this, savaging our expectations and assumptions. These scenes also begin the analysis of the conflict between the individual and the mass/community that is one of the film's main themes, the ethics of revolution, their potential similarity to to capitalist, murderous anarchy, and the rights or duties of the individual to abstain or take part.  The film's trajectory is ironic - Juan moves from an opportunistic chicken thief who dreams of nothing but robbing banks to unwitting hero of the revolution, but at the wrenching expense of his family and best friend.If DYNAMITE deals specifically with the Mexican Revolution, it compresses all the violent struggles of the last vile century.  Some of the nocturnal battle scenes recall World War I trench warfare, while the uniforms of the fascists, the street executions, the collaborators, the Holocaust-like slaughter of Juan's family, the move from the bright outdoors to murky interiors, all recall the Second World War.  Sean himself is escaping revolution and imperial tyranny, while the invocation of America as a promised land can only sound hollow at the height of the Vietnam War, and especially in the Latin American context.  While Leone's left-wing sympathies are never in doubt, he was criticised at the time for the vagueness of his approach, but time has borne out his scepticism, his despairing hope, his refusal of propaganda, his anger.DYNAMITE wouldn't be a Leone film if it wasn't also a commentary on film-making, and it is his most significantly self-reflexive movie, with repeated shots of men looking, especially through widescreen gaps.  Juan himself looks uncommonly like Leone, while Coburn's cigar-chomping calm as he ruminates over his next composition, makes him an obvious director figure.  In one brilliant, hilarious, scary shot, anticipating the Saatchis by a quarter of a century, has Juan gazing through the ripped eyes of the dictator's poster image.  Many US directors are invoked and examined, from Hawks, where the redemption of the transgressor is pointlessly, egotistically nihilistic, to Peckinpah, then the major innovator in Westerns (and whose THE WILD BUNCH was set around the same period as DYNAMITE), whose montage shooting of violence is alluded to in the early carriage hijack scene.This is a film packed with with memorable sequences, some exhilirating, some harrowing - the blowing up of the bridge, the train collision, the nightime rainswept executions.  It is clear to see Leone's influence on the movie brats, from the tank shaped like Darth Vader's head, to the filming of action .  But there are two scenes that stand out for me, ranking with the best of Leone: the first is Sean watching the Doctor betray revolutionaries; he flashbacks to his own betrayal by his best friend - his circular retaliation immediately cuts to the fascist's executing, disturbingly linking revolutionary and reactionary, past and present, myth and reality (in the betrayal scene, Sean views everything in a mirror, his masculine wholeness shattered).Secondly, in the middle of a raging, very physical and real battle, Sean is shot; Juan's horror is expressed in a complete suspension of time and place, as oppressive quiet and darkness shrouds his helplessness.  It is a beautiful moment in a wonderful film.",9,3,9,30 June 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Canny Woo.
","What could have been another tiresome superhero-foils-the-villains film becomes subversive deconstruction in the hands of John Woo.  By shooting in an audacious, fragmentary, ironic style; by alluding to a number of directors - Leone, Melville, Kubrick etc. - whose metier has been to undermine the ideal of the conventional action hero; by once again (after FACE/OFF) invoking Franju, inserting his famous white birds signifying madness at the precise moment  when Ethan 'Colin' Hunt is preparing to save the day; by associating the central triangle with earth, wind and fire, and leaving out water (Robert Towne, remember?), without which we would all die, Woo undermines the film's retrogressive assumptions, giving us a seriously compromised hero.  The colours are to die for.  Genius.",7,1,3,27 July 2000
The Insider," Much of this is excellent, and yet...
","I hope I can say this under IMDb guidelines, but THE INSIDER is a little disappointing after the mighty HEAT.  It's not that it's a bad film  - on the contrary, it's a rare Hollywood film that treats its subject with seriousness, irony and complexity.  Unfortunately, it shares the classical epic's delusion that somehow length confers greater worthiness, and so we get a lot of dragged out scenes of people just staring, which perhaps gives a truer sense of what it must be like for ordinary people in such circumstacnes - the sheer tedious dread - but dissipates, in contradiction of the closing credits, the film's 'dramatic effect'.In many ways similar to ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (as has been pointed out) - an investigation into 'respectable' corruption (in this case the Columbia-like addiction-mongering of tobacco companies) - it is also that film's complete opposite.  Whatever its flaws, Pakula's film was shaped as a thriller, had the exciting momentum of a thriller, the driving sense of two detective figures bringing enlightenment to a depressingly murky situation.
There was always a large element of wish-fulfilment about this.  For a start, the case had already been won, the film felt like retreading old victories.  But most seriously, the shadowy Establishment network that allowed Watergate to happen was never punctured - Nixon was a scapegoat, things were allowed to get back to normal.  This is half-suggested in Pakula's tireless determination to make a conspiracy thriller out of everything, but the essential American faith in right and truth outing was generally asserted.Michael Mann is too good a director to settle for this.  His film does follow a feel-good arc - revelation of corruption, suppression of revelation, eventual revelation of revelation - which suggests that men of truth and honour can defeat proto-fascist corporate power.  And there is, like THREE KINGS, a sense that audiences wouldn't be able to handle a more realistic ending.But Mann ironises this arc at every turn.  His hero is Lowell Bergman, a CBS news producer with a reputation for securing great stories in some of the world's most dangerous hot-spots.  He is played by Al Pacino, an actor in the grandstanding manner, who, despite many villainous roles, carries with him a dogged, Spencer Tracy-like integrity.  In following his point-of-view, we get to see the development of the plot and the workings of corporate power.In the opening sequecne, as Bergman is being driven through Iran, we see what he sees - when he looks in a particular direction, the camera follows. The thing is, he doesn't see anything, he is blindfolded - the traditional treatment to the Hollywood hero has been brilliantly subverted, and undermines Bergman as a hero thorughout the film.For instance, when Bergman, trying to persuade Wigand to talk, suggest, idealistically, information is power at a Japanese restaurant.  Mann frames the two men sitting in the traditional Japanese manner, almost legless, not looking very powerful at all.So in a film where there is an awful  lot of talk adn exposition, it is crucial that Mann's irony gives us, the audience, the real view, as in that first sequence.  A recurrent motif is Bergman standing godlike from a balcony looking out over a huge city - he does not survey all he sees; it's an impenetrable blank to him.  Just as the plot slips away from him, he talks to Wigand on the phone on a beach- Mann cuts to him wading in the water like King Canute.  This subtle ironising makes it all the more credible when this blustering hero, totally in control, driving the plot with ariculate confidence, is suddenly shown to have very little real power at all.Wigand isn't ironised in quite the same way - he is in a more passive position, defending his family, repository of information.  BUt his introduction also shows how removed he is from the real world.  WE see him first in his office which looks onto a staff canteen - the realms are only separated by a glass wall, but they could be two different worlds - his dark, lonely,furtive, suffocating, sinister (we don't know what he's doing, but it looks very secretive), dislocatingly cut with the friendly, communal, human babble of the canteen.  WHen he goes to leave the building, the camera slows down, the sound is blocked out, the light brightens, adn Wigand looks like he's entering a dream or fairytale world.THis ironising is crucial, because the film takes on a feel-good turn.  At first it suggest taht truth can be recorded, delivered to the public, despite the flexing of corporate muscle.  When this threatens , there are alternative means of diffusion.  BUt look  at thow Wigand's testimony is recorded.  We see the testimony split into different screens, teh 'real' Wigand and his screen image.  Lter we see Bergman editing the piece, rearranging the truth to achieve it more powerfully.  There is no such thing as an unmediated 'pure' truth, and although this might seem rather obvious, it sours the heric sense of the truth finally getting out to the public. Also disturbing is the possiblity, that never actually occured to me until the smear attacks, that Wigand might be lying.  WE are given no evidence adn are expected to take this man's word.  THE idea of anyone's 'word' being simply enough is so rejected by the film that itt further undermines the optimistic intentions, and this is never resolved withing the film.  Is there somehow an abstract 'truth' thast can be extracted from the deeply compromised eople that utter it?All this is great - and there are some interesting insights about families (although not, as ever with MANN, women) adn imiplications about the wider sphere of political and media corruptoin - but the film is too subversive for its own good.  It undermines its heroes, its themes, its genre, its mode of representation, its setting.  THis is all necessary adn brilliant, but it doesn't leave much for a film, certainly at this lentgh.  Unlike ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN - a film about actively seeking a well-defined truth - THE INSIDER is about defending a compromised truth - and this passivity means that it can never work as a thriller - you keep waiting for something to happen adn it doesn't.  It can't.",5,8,12,15 March 2000
Toy Story 2," John Lasseter is the new Hitchcock: smuggling disturbing ideas into mass-market movies.
","Sometimes you beg for an epiphany and it doesn't quite come.  TOY STORY 2 is easily the best film of the year so far, funnier, richer, more inventive, frightening and emotional than anything else, because animation can do everything live action can do, and so much more.  Even the songs this time round are enjoyable (except, maybe, Jessie's lachrymose lament).  It deals with unbearably complex dilemmas with a maturity untapped by the likes of AMERICAN BEAUTY.  This should surely be enough - maybe I expect too much.It's been peculiar in reviews to see critics' astonishment that a mere cartoon could actually carry so much weighty baggage.  They mustn't watch too many cartoons, because films from PINOCCHIO to THE THREE CABALLEROS to THE LION KING offer a similar assortment of riches.  Maybe they're secretly afraid that their precious actors will be made redundant.2 works on many different levels.  Most immediately satisfying is the Hawksian romantic-comedy action movie, in which we watch men in action , at work, facing dark realities, positing loyalty and friendship as shores against the ruins.  This strand has a sublime emotional ambiguity, as on one level Buzz and friends repeatedly risk their lives to save a friend (Buzz is the Hawksian hero who must redeem himself after the first movie), while Woody (who also must redeem himself) at last finds a family, somewhere to belong just as he seemed outmoded and unloved.This difficult choice between friendship proven in action and mere family ties is brilliantly, painfully revealed, and there are no easy answers. For the benefit of resolution, the family is not a love interest, which could have made things more awkward, and one member is made villainous for convenience, but the questions raised are still valid.The film also works as an essay in making strange and unreliable the domestic and conservative.  On the one hand, there is something satisfyingly Surrealist about a house in which objects have more life than its human inhabitants - the different strands of reality set up by Buzz's opening adventures suggest that this may be the dream of an over-imaginative boy. There is a lack of fixity and control in having objects, bought by you to do your bidding, acting independently; it makes the solidity of the home unstable and unpredictable.Yet, on the other hand, this alternative community is itself ordered in its seeming chaos, with almost military precision, and even before its terrifying adventures, its threats ARE the domestic, the fickleness of a child, the thoughtlessness of a mother, the vulnerability that privileges menacing villains.2's great brilliance, though, lies in its expressing an awareness of its status as a sequal with the existential crises of its two heroes.  Woody starts the film with a lost hat (traditional emblem of masculine wholeness, virility, sexual prowess etc); he damages, then loses an arm; is abandoned and has a sublimely terrifying nightmare where the solidity of his existence crumbles, and he imagines the abyss of death.Already shaken in identity, he is kidnapped, wrenched from familiar bearings, while performing a heroic act, and finds out that he is not a single, whole Woody, but part of a vast Woody legend, connected (as is this film) to a venerable tradition, repeated and reproduced ad nauseum, through merchandise.  His sense of wholeness destroyed, he accepts his fate, his destiny away from the world of life that is Andy's bedroom, to the sterile immortality of the museum.In TOY STORY, Buzz already came to an awareness of his own limited masculinity.  But, in the film's most astonishing conceit, he faces a catacomb of Buzz Lightyears, and is forced to confront not only his lack of uniqueness, and not only the deluded image of his former past, but a new improved model; like Woody, Buzz becomes aware of the transience of life. The film opens with Buzz as intrepid action hero, only to be shockingly destroyed and shown to be a puppet in a computer game.The image of two Buzzes and their evil father point to an awareness of the ambiguity of being a sequel (as a son is to a father), but also the powerlessness of anything in a postmodern world; there is no such thing as the film as unit - it is splintered outwards through merchandise, sequels, promotion etc.Of course, 2 is most cherishable for being an incredible work of animation. So we're a bit jaded after STORY, but the CITIZEN KANE-like depth of field, the unheard of cinematic fluidity (which is not just trickery, but emotionally charged), the vibrant suburban colours, the ingenious characterisation (love Newman as, well, Newman), the awesome set-pieces (my favourite?  Either Woody's dream or Buzz and friends crossing the road) and exciting action, the musical-like freedom and audacity, the ingenious compositions, the very tangibility of the characters unavailable to live action, are all breathtaking.  In the end, I think I prefer the classical simplicity of STORY to this film's more varied daring, but who cares?

A Clockwork Orange," Astonishing, but is there something missing?
","This film, withheld for 30 years in Britain, and banned in Ireland, is finally rereleased, and five things are immediately apparent:* That this is, as always with Kubrick, a stunningly beautiful film, with the stylised, futuristic, predominantly white set design clashing crucially with the very real, grim, abandoned 70s Britain, looking more post-apocalyptic than anything Kubrick could imagine;* That the film is absolutely hilarious, for childish reasons, as caricature, as alarmingly prescient satire in this era of New Labour;* That the film's 'ethical' difficulties arise from a Hitchcockian engagement with point-of-view, which points the blame on passive viewing (and, by extension our (non)engagement with society);* That the film is gleefully homoerotic - check out the sly imagery in the warehouse fight scene between the two rival gangs;* And that A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, for all its thrilling rush, and for all its showing up of our cowardly generations' cinema, is not a Kubrick masterpiece: whether the ironies are too broad, or the structure is too schematic, I don't know, but, unlike THE SHINING or BARRY LYNDON, Kubrick's major achievements, it just doesn't breathe.

Eyes Wide Shut," Stanley Kubrick was the one director to have only directed masterpieces: the more you think about this deceptive film, the more this might be still true.
","For the first half of this film I was reeling in disbelieving dismay.  What had happened to the great Stanley Kubrick, along with Peckinpah and Burton the great American director of the last forty years?  The old style now lacked any life, lapsing into cod-Felliniisms (sic?); the story was without any real interest; and where the hell was Nicole Kidman when we needed her?Then I realised how wrong I had been.  Many critics have noted, in surprise, how faithful the film is to Schnitzler's trite novella.  This is, I believe, where they were misled.  Only on a superficial level can it truly be called a faithful adaptation.   EYES WIDE SHUT can only be properly appreciated as a Kubrick film.  It's not really an examination of marriage or psychoanalysis, as is the book.  Like LOLITA, 2001, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, BARRY LYNDON and THE SHINING - it concerns the gradual disintegration of a hero who began the movie whole, confident and self-satisfied.In this way, the most helpful references might not be to Freud, but Nabokov and, perhaps bizarrely, Eric Rohmer.  Like Nabokov, especially in Lolita, the assured faith in witness of the hero is constantly undermined.  Unlike the novel, in which Fridolin's peregrinations are unambiguously dreamlike (its title translates as Dream Story), Kubrick takes care to establish the superficial reality of Bill's adventures.  As these go on, though, coincidences, correspondances, nagging implausibilities and absurdities begin to undermine this reality.  The film, like Lolita, is impossibly symmetrical - the first two important scenes (Bill with his family; Bill in a crisis moment with Zeigler)exactly match the last two scenes (except for Bill's power in them); and there is an elegant patterning and repetition throughout.  The ludicrous, Victorian, 'motivation' of a novel called Dream Story is completely weeded out, and characters are reduced to ciphers, as is appropriate to a dream.This is where Rohmer comes in.  His films, on a superficial level, concern bright young things talking talking talking about sex and philosophy, but his use of colour, framing and allusion (paintings, books, films, songs etc.) tell a completely different story.  Similarly here.  The crucial sequence is the opening party at Ziegler's.  Everything in Bill's 'dream' that follows springs from this.  For instance, the models that invite Bill for a menage-a-trois promise him a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow: in his plot, the costume shop he visits is called Rainbow.Most important is the scene with Ziegler in the bathroom.  For a start, the room is covered in mirrors.  On one level is a naked, possibly dead, girl on an armchair; on another is a painting of a sprawling naked woman (I thought it was by Matisse, but I couldn't find it when I looked it up later). Already slightly drunk, and aroused after the models, can you imagine the effect of these two naked women multiply reflected in all those mirrors must have on Bill?  This mixture of profuse nudity, and fear of death, ring throughout his 'dream'.Secondly, the rich red of the painting echoes throughout Bill's adventures, colouring everything unrealistically, especially the orgy scene, and Ziegler's billiards room, completely undermining the latter's 'explanation'. This is a wonderful scene, completely misunderstood by Kubrick devotee Michael Dwyer.The film operates as an Oedipal story in reverse.  In (simplistic) Freudian terms, to enter into society, a man must symbolically kill his father and marry a mother substitute.  This Bill utterly fails to do.  Ziegler is the father figure here, and Bill at the opening is forced to confront his father, having just completed the primal scene.  His subsequent attempts throughout the film, to 'marry' this 'mother' result only in her death, and Ziegler's increased superiority.  As a son grows older, he is supposed to see flaws in his father, see that he doesn't have the answers to everything. But in the billiards room scene, Ziegler CAN answer everything, he is total control, like a father correcting an errant child.Bill ends the film reduced to the childlike level of his daughter, in tears, totally dependent on, and at the mercy of, his wife ('mother').  If this is optimistic, as everyone has been claiming, than I'm Stanley Kubrick. Obviously not everything here fits - one would hope not, and I have only seen the film once, so give me a break.  The emphasis on the hero at the expense of the heroine might seem misogynistic, but that would be to miss the point of the film's deconstruction.One of the film's structural motifs is storytelling.  Foucault once linked epistomology and sex, and here almost every character  has a story to tell, a way of controlling and shaping experience.  Everyone except Bill, who must find his own story (linked to his having sex).  However he keeps being waylaid by others' (especially his wife's), and his own 'conclusion' (Ziegler's explanation) does the opposite of what he had hoped: it emasculates and infantilises him.On a simply entertainment level, EYES WIDE SHUT is a joy.  As I've said elsewhere, it's been an atrocious year for cinema, so it's enrapturing to see a genuine master in mature, if not absolutely outstanding, form. Kubrick's famous tracking shots, besides being so aesthetically breathtaking in themselves, create a real sense of the steady ground moving from under the characters' feet, slowly slipping away.  The film is very VERY funny, especially in its use of doomladen piano music in the orgy scene and after in Bill's head whenever a crisis point occurs (the orgy should not be taken as literal and 'daring', but as a centring of the signifiers and anxieties whirring in Bill's head), as well as the mocking insertion of old favorites such as 'Strangers In The Night'.  Shostakovitch's glorious Waltz from Jazz Suite No. 2, the film's musical motif, is gorgeously evocative, as well as being, appropriately, a parodic pastiche (and impossible to get out of your head).The scenes between Kidman and Cruise are remarkable and painful;  one never had Kubrick down as such a perceptive artist of domestic comedy (although THE SHINING should have been a clue).  Nicole Kidman is truly brilliant in a difficult role, but Tom Cruise is strangely perfect, his smug persona wonderfully sent up (see especially the scene where he gives the prosititute/student 'compensation'), his eventual reduction after his confession to a little boy truly convincing.  Since A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick films have invariably received initially unfavorable reviews, only for subsequent viewings to reveal them as astonishing masterworks (BARRY LYNDON and THE SHINING are the pinnacles of modern cinema).  I would not be remotely surprised if the same thing happened with this film.",8,1,3,13 September 1999
Scream 2," Oedipus not the king.
","Still fun: it was never going to live up to the original, but its remarkable how shoddy this sequel is.  The comedy is minimised in favour of excessive violence, which, because the script avoids building up character, has, ironically, less impact than the original.  The early dispatch of Sarah Michelle Gellar without giving her anything to do is criminal, while Neve Campbell's inexpressivity is almost Franjuesque.  The amusingly pretentious references to Greek theatre add to the spirit of play and do give force to the film's best scene, when Gail watches Dewey (as Oedipus) being attacked.",6,0,1,31 March 2000
The Sixth Sense," Gently devastating, angry, Surrealist wonder.
","Genuinely Surrealist artefact, in which a film whose structure is pervaded with death and dream has exploded into the mainstream.  Best image: long shot of Malcolm and Anna caressing after his honouring by the city; the silver inscription tilted ominously sideways. Appropriately about the disruption of the domestic, but also the crimes and injustices of history returning to haunt the present, and especially the innocent.  As such, its Surrealsim is political.  Twist obviously crucial: but if we don't get it we must ask why we didn't find certain scenes strange.  Do we find lack of communication normal?  Acceptable?",Null,0,0,8 December 1999
Rear Window," Even Homer nods. (possible spoiler)
","Hitchcock's most perfect movie, so perfect that it ALMOST seems unsatisfying.  Compared to VERTIGO, where every loose end and ambiguity only leads one into an interpretive labyrinth, each piece of REAR WINDOW's puzzle seems to fit; there is little room for doubt.  Interpretations are variations on two themes - a critique of voyeurism; and an investigation into heterosexual relationships (critics have been quick to pounce on the paralells between the Thorwalds and Jeffries and Lisa, their names all begin with 'L'), and the film is probably the best we have on both these subjects.But, like Peter Wollen, I see Hitchcock as primarily a Surrealist, and read this way, we can return to the film all the ambiguity and doubt proper to Hitch's artistry.  The film is about playing God.  Two gods, the director and the lead character.  It is important to note the difference, and Hitchcock does very clearly, because it is the disparity between the two that calls into question the very reality of the film itself.
Although the film we are about to watch concerns assault, murder, loneliness, attempted rape, and modern alienation, it opens with a score of uncommon jauntiness.  Three blinds go up one by one, not by human hand, revealing the view from the rear window, the field of the film's play.  The camera then travels through this field, introducing us briefly to the secondary characters and environs before finally bringing us to our hero, LB Jeffries, asleep on his chair.This opening sequence is crucial in two ways.  Firstly, the majority of the film's action arises from motivation inspired by Jeff's point of view.  He sees a certain action, he interprets it, and the other characters act accordingly.  He is a godlike character, in classic Hollywood close-up, while the little people he watches are boxed in their little lives like TV sets.  He can even create people; before we even meet Lisa, he has provided us with a detailed picture of her, that she seems to conform to pretty well. He sees all, like God, and no-one can see him.Except, of course, he doesn't.  This opening sequence has already shown us things he hasn't seen.  He is frequently missing important plot elements, through sleep, or watching someone else, or being bothered by Lisa.  The sleep thing is important.  Notice how many scenes begin with Jeff waking up, or how the climactic events, which fulfil his every prediction, takes place at night.  Notice the repetition and circularity in the film, how certain scenes, patterns, motifs, colours return (eg. Lisa turning on the three lights), like signposts in a dream.  Look at how a man in a cast, powerless, impotent (unable to even uncork a wine bottle) grows in power, turns two sensible independent women into his pawns.Notice how Thorwald is his doppelganger, not an evil Other, how when he looks at Thorwald he sees himself, how Thorwald's window reflects on his lens, how the final struggle is less between good and evil, than an existential conflict of the self.  Note the pattern of Jeff's viewing, especially the correlation between Miss Torso and the Thorwalds, he always turns from one to the other.  Miss Torso represents sex, Jeff's lust; the Thorwalds death - the two are inseperable in his mind, especially when you consider Lisa compared Miss Torso's loneliness to her own.
Watch how the views across the street are less those of independent characters, than projections of Jeff's desire or anxiety - watch how each one seem to match his state of mind.  Is it far-fetched to suggest that the whole film is Jeff's dream?Even if you reject this extreme interpretation, Hitchcock's ironies are masterly.  Jeff is a man whose career is to travel the world, who is a war hero, and yet is not only confined to a cast, but is forced to confront the notion of home, of melodrama, of the lives of 'ordinary' people who have to stay put and do the same thing day in day out.  When you think about it, most of what happens across the street is the stuff of cheap novelette - Jeff obviously doesn't read very much (or else he wouldn't be spying) - haven't we all imagined scenarios for people we see on buses etc.
What about Jeff's fear of sex, his pleasure in onanism (figured in his continuous need to scratch)?  Or, one of the most beautiful scenes in all Hitchcock (i.e. cinema), the kiss, where the film slows down, and the story becomes a momentary fairy tale, operating on a different temporal level, out of time - Jeff's problem is that he has too much time, too much of the same time.  Hitchcock never features in the group of great 1950s melodramatists, but surely his subversion of the crime genre, and masculinity, is every bit as melodramatic as Minnelli or Ray.The film, as well as sensing, years before Antonioni, urban alienation, also reveals the fears of men with no more wars to fight or Wests to win, and must stay at home, like women have always had to.  Jeff's real pain is that Lisa is independent, mobile, earning as much, if not more, than him, and refuses to kowtow.  Far from being a misogynist, as is his reputation, Hitchcock always shows how silly men are.(Oh yeah, I forgot.  It's a brilliant thriller too - I've seen the film a dozen times, and still get breathless and sweaty when Lisa goes into Thorwald's apartment.  And the scene, where the dead dog is discovered (the only time until the climax any of the groundlings get more than a long shot) has the best editing since THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS).",10,2,4,29 March 2000
Tarzan," Maddening, but brilliant (possible spoiler)
","A mediocre film in Disney's history, but absolutely brilliant in the context of 1999.  Gleefully violent and filled with shocking innuendo, the plot makes up for neglible plotting with the almost BAMBIesque creation of a believable anthropomorphic universe.  The animated movement is sublime, and makes almost all live action films look clunky; the colour and characterisation is a pleasure - the death of Clayton is one of the best things ever in Disney.  There are the usual complaints - hair-pulling score, neo-fascist bildungsroman narrative; the muddled conservatism that confuses distrust of patriarchy and celebration of matriarchy with dollops of Social Darwinism.  Worst of all is the idea of a Disney film railing against cultural exploitation.  This mixture of squirm-inducing ideology and breathless aesthetic joy makes for a very disturbing viewing experience.",8,1,2,8 December 1999
Braveheart," The worst film ever made.
","Imagine David Thomson's John Ford really existed - he'd have made BRAVEHEART.  The IMDb guidelines ask us to refrain from being nasty, but surely I can say that this is a deeply fascist work, one that offers only one point of view, reduces to caricatures anything that opposes it, and is filmed in a bludgeoning, wearing style.  The treatment of the English is appropriate and probably accurate, but the response is brutal, ugly and reprehensible.  The homophobia is horrific, and the film's bigotries and allegiances seem aimed at football hooligans, republicans and thugs.  Worse than any of this, though, is that it is a very dull film, which is badly made when it isn't reiterating cliches, and its cod-Celtic, very fascist sentimentality is nauseating.",1,17,43,17 November 1999
Gladiator," All hail Maximus Acronyms - Romans Unite Before Bullying Insurgent Spanish Heman! (possible spoiler in final paragraph)
","There is a lovely film in here about a spoilt brat teenager who unfortunately has tyrannical rule over the Roman Empire.  So whereas most sulky boys kick tables and storm off to their room, Commodus Caesar gets to throw those who annoy and humiliate him to digitally enhanced cats. Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance, camp in the best swords and sandals tradition, throwing childish fits when he doesn't get his way, sporting marvellously gothic eyeliner (Romans vs Goths, you see), scheming elaborate punishments for his big sister, which, for him, unlike the rest of us, who get our hair pulled, can actually, horribly, be realised.It's also nice to see that the hackneyed tide of postmodernism has been stemmed Canute-like, and a complex period in Roman history, with its plagues, revolts, tyrannies and back-room intrigues and murders can be 'crystallised' in a young boy's feeling unloved by his father.  Haven't we all felt this melancholy burden at one time or another, the failure to do what is right, honourable and Stoic, when ambition and privilege seem much more immediately rewarding?Add to this the accursed, tragic flaws of incest and worse (the difference between mad tyrant and noble hero must always be expressed in terms of neurotic sexuality and fertility-turned-ascetic renunciation), and you have a truly harassed, 'modern' hero, well supported by a ripe mixture of theatrical greats (Derek Jacobi) and former 60s icons (Oliver Reed, David Hemmings - is this Scott's THE LIMEY?).  He gets to watch some champion gladiating too.Of course, a film of this stature, size and scope must inevitably have its longueurs, here an elaborate sub-plot involving Russell Crowe, an inexorable melange of MAD MAX/BRAVEHEART (noble hero turned insane revenger after wife and family slaughtered; the bleak landscapes witnessing vastly scaled pub brawls; the lengthy, dimly lit, self-agonising indoor scenes, as a 'man' debates within himself his 'man'liness and duty; the loaded dichotomy between caricatured, vicious Imperials and unswervingly decent warrior; buddy-buddy development; Godardian, alienating, swelling score) and SPARTACUS (the violent gladiator scenes; the chinned sincerity; the captive peasant taking on the might of the Roman Empire; the structural homophobia).Crowe is a revelation - and reveals a hitherto unmined talent for comedy and parody.  Of course, this works because, like Leslie Nielsen, he marshalls a tautly disciplined straight face, but his clenched surliness, his Heston-like intergrity, his attempt to absorb the Stoic precepts of Marcus Aurelius (his scenes with Richard Harris are worthy of that masterpiece oof classical epics, CARRY ON CLEO), his reciting dialogue Abrahams-Zucker-Abrahams would have been proud to have written, are so funny (the scene where he rises off the ground of the auditorium to 'meet' his family is pure comic genius), so expertly pomposity-bursting, so winding up the pretensions of an entire genre, I emerged from the film with great respect for this stunningly versatile, deceptive actor.He couldn't have done it, though, without the help of Ridley Scott, essaying another mass culture in decline, who has bravely exorcised the complexities, ambiguities and enigmas of BLADE RUNNER to create an admirably simplistic epic, to abandon the weight of historical validity in favour of Boys' Own fantasy.  It would have been easy with this budget to create a teeming, living, authentic Rome, but Scott the postmodernist recognises the impossibility of this project, and, in an act of avant-garde innovation, hangs his drama on a handful of geometric signifiers, with little relation to any reality beyond the drawing board.There has been an extraordinary , and for me higly promising, strain in modern Hollywood filmmaking (eg TITANIC, THE PHANTOM MENACE), in which the new digital technology is not used to create novel, vast, convincing, strange worlds, but to elucidate the principles of Brechtian epic theatre, to foreground artificiality, implausibility, soullessness, encouraging the audience out of the narrative, to stand back and reflect on issues such as the construction of history, mass spectacle etc.  The dreams of the New Wave may finally have come to fruition.Like most films of this type, GLADIATOR is about a hero who is too good for his society, who cannot live in it.  But is he?  The absence of historical verity in the story set me thinking to about what Scott was trying to say. Because the film is a story about a man who lets his family die, who isn't there for them.  This is a curious hero to celebrate, though appropriate in an age where fathers often abandon their families, even to the extent of not paying alimony.  After Maximus (Scott must have been a Monty Python fan) sees the charred crucified bodies, the film goes momentarily into dream mode.  But does it ever come out of it?  This is a story that is full of doubles, strange correspondances, mirror scenes; it thoroughly interrogates the nature of family, and finally reaches a ritual climax in which both sides of the same coin (sons) wipe each other out, like Gothic doppelgangers.  Is the whole film Maximus's guilty dream, about guilt, emasculation, eternal torture over failure, the descent into bestiality? Is it a theme of America's guilt over slavery and subsequent race traumas, or a renunciation of them (both whites and blacks are slaves here).  Whatever. This is the first great comedy of the millennium.",1,12,30,16 May 2000
