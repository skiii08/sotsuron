National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Really Good popcorn flick
","I'm not going to give away any secrets here. I'll just talk in generalities. I thought it was pretty faithful to the original movie both in plot and charm. The first 5 minutes or so, I was thinking to myself, gosh this is starting out like Ghost busters II!. Then, it started to roll and roll it did. If you are a fan of the Indiana Jones series, it was similar to the 2nd of that franchise. It's really hard for a sequel to make the same impact as the first one, and this movie fell a little short in that all of the things that were likable in the first one were present in the second, but it wasn't new anymore. Ed Harris gives his usual solid performance, and all of the principal characters of the first movie are there in the 2nd with one or two pleasant additions. I dare to hope for National Treasure 3!!. If they do it right, it will make a nice box set.",8,1,3,31 December 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I thought it was just OK
","Sorry to disagree with so many people. I really thought it was just OK. I think that they had the makings of a very funny, and witty film with some good social commentary, but denigrated the whole thing with a bunch of really sick-nasty low brow humor. It's really somewhat depressing that people think that a comedy can only be successful if it includes all sorts of deviant sexual behavior and junior high school locker room gross out stuff. The critics call all of this crap 'ground breaking' and 'edgy' and 'pushing the envelope'. I just call it a cheap substitute for intelligent humor. Can't think of another really good Joke?? Throw in some gay-anal stuff instead. Oh well. I'd give it 1 thumb up you know where.",6,0,3,9 April 2007
Nacho Libre," Hit waaass Goooood. Ah Lacked it A Lottttt
","OK. I passed this movie up 100 times at Hollywood Video because it looked mind numbingly dumb. A friend of mine said it was actually pretty funny so we gave it a try. I really liked it! The soundtrack was awesome! and the cinematography was very good, and I really liked the acting. All of the characters were played to a T in my mind. As for the commentator that said this was a Christian feel good movie..whatever dude... I really got drawn in by this. The guy that played Escueleto was hysterical! And of course sister Encarnacion would make most guys have uncomfortable feelings towards a nun. I liked Jack Black in it. He's usually not my cup of tea, but did a really good job in this. When he was doing his stretching exercises in the park with the Sister there..it was hilarious. The whole training thing with launched melons and beehives was surreal!. I bought in to the whole movie in that it was about a subject I had no interest in (luchadores) and an Actor that I'm lukewarm about (Jack Black) and it all came together for me into a wonderful entertainment experience. Good job all!",7,0,0,15 July 2008
28 Weeks Later," REALLY COOL! Silly plot etc, but Great Zombie movie!
","What can I say. I saw 28 days later on video and was pleasantly surprised and thought it was a really tight, entertaining horror flick. Rather than sit and compile a list of holes in the plot etc., I just sat back and enjoyed it for what it was. I really had low expectations for the 2nd one because so many sequels turn up lame. This was also a pleasant surprise. It was a different set of characters under a different set of circumstances but I thought it was about as much fun to watch and overall a good horror flick as the first! I don't want to spoil anything, but I did get into the characters, and felt sad for those that met their demise. Again, if you don't expect the greatest movie ever made, the most intelligent plot etc., but are willing to just take it for what it is, It was a lot of fun to watch, and I would probably be inclined to see the next one if it were to become a trilogy.",8,0,1,30 November 2007
District 9," Good but disappointing
","I had read many of the critics reviews prior to seeing this. My expectations were set very high based on that. I was expecting a blade runner, the thing, pick a sci-fi classic, and it was supposed to rank with those. Unfortunately, this didn't quite make it in my mind. It was a good movie. The lead actor did a very good job. The CGI and special effects were excellent, and the story line was overall good. But for some reason, the one thing that the movie failed to do was to get me emotionally involved. I don't know why. It could have been the format of the film which had a lot of news clip type coverage. Heck, Starship Troopers had that but it was very good in a quirky way. I'm just having a hard time putting my finger on it. I also had trouble suspending disbelief at times and thought that parts of the movie were too implausible to buy into. I know a lot of people have raved about it. This may just be a case of some people not liking vanilla ice cream. I wouldn't discourage someone from seeing it. I just think it was a bit of a letdown.",7,6,12,17 August 2009
2012," Great Special Effects, Giant Holes in plot and script!
","The special effects were the saving grace of this movie period. I really don't know how to put a finger on it. There was just something that kept the movie from coming together and gelling into something greater than the sum of it's parts. When I saw that Danny (Hugo Chavez Loving) Glover was in the oval office, it was a big turnoff for me, but maybe a little bit of an ironic casting choice when you think about it. It also irked me somewhat that China plays a major roll in the attempted salvation of mankind. That was another odd choice if you think about their record on human rights. Also, the science, or lack thereof behind the cataclysm was pretty thin, and I had trouble suspending my disbelief. There are probably a bunch of other things I could slap this movie around on, but I must say that the special effects were AWESOME! I had a little trouble getting emotionally attached to the characters like I did in Armageddon or Independence day. It's too bad because 6 of the 7 I'm giving this are for the special effects. The remaining 1 0f 7 is the sum of all the other things I liked about the movie.",7,0,0,16 November 2009
Ghost Rider," Somewhat Cheesy, somewhat mind numbingly dumb, but fun to watch
","OK..I put this up there with a few other Marvel based movies that were beyond dumb but entertaining. This is sort of like daredevil which was a lame, but entertaining movie but Ghost Rider has a really cool hog. I'm not going to do any spoilers because there really isn't any major plot element to spoil. It's just your basic good vs evil, love story, action movie. I really thought that Raquel Alessi was quite fetching in this!! Might I say this again, I thought Raquel Alessi was really quite fetching in this!!. They had pretty good special effects and it was fun to watch overall, but not what I would call memorable. I don't know how much mr. Cage made from this, but if it was more than a mill or two, it was probably too much.",6,0,1,28 December 2007
Dumb and Dumber," Brilliantly stupid
","I like really smart, or brilliantly stoopid. I think brilliantly stupid is harder to pull of and they did it! The potty humor, snow ball fight, mini bike, etc, etc, etc were just awesome! I almost needed to wear a diaper I laughed so hard while watching this.Although I don't like all Jim Carry movies, I think he is enormously talented, and Jeff Daniels was the perfect match for him in this inept comedy! I watched Dumb and Dummerer for about 5 minutes and couldn't continue. It was too painful, and I felt really bad for the actors who tried to fill the shoes of Jim and Jeff in the first installment. There are no two that could have pulled it off. Just as Jacky Mason or anyone could ever replace Rodney in Caddyshack.",9,5,8,23 March 2009
National Treasure," Really not half bad! A very entertaining action, adventure, romance
","My expectations were a little bit low for this. I was pleasantly surprised. At first blush, it seemed like the Studio Bigwigs were trying to piggy back on the success of DaVinci Code. That made me skeptical. Although I still believe that was the intent, they actually pulled it off! While the ancient Secret Society, buried treasure, and Intellectual treasure hunt theme was preserved, it was executed with surprising freshness and watch-ability. Nick Cage has been hit an miss in many of his movies, but I think he did a very good job in this one, pulling off the Partly Nerdish, yet secretly Swashbuckling adventurer to a tee. I would watch this one again. I would even look forward to some sort of equally well done sequel, but based on the outcome of this one, don't really see how they could script that without making it seem really forced.",7,1,1,12 September 2005
War of the Worlds," Caution..World invaded by SCIENTOLOGISTS!
","What can I say..The only thing that saved this movie was Dakota Fanning and excellent special effects! Tom Cruise's portrayal was forced. It seemed like he was having trouble making his ego fit on the screen. The plot was rather thin. And how did that minivan make it where all surrounding life didn't!! Is it watchable? Yeah. Is it memorable? Not really. Could I watch it again? Yeah..when it comes out on DVD. Will I buy the DVD? Nah.So, in conclusion, I don't believe this was a total resounding dud bomb stinker like Alexander, but it could have been better. It had a lot of elements that could have made this a great movie, but somewhere, I feel it missed the mark and I've relegated it to the 'Movie Chow' folder. Nothing special..but It will keep movie watchers alive",5,0,0,12 September 2005
There Will Be Blood," Great acting, plodding and pedantic movie
","As usual, I thought Daniel Day Lewis was intense and on top of his game. Unfortunately, I think the movie itself was just OK. I guess it was a shoe in with the academy because it portrayed an evil greedy oil baron and a false preacher who both more or less renounce the existence of God. Sort of parable where Dick Cheney meets some fallen televangelist. Hollywood loves stuff which portrays all corporate titans as greedy, heartless monsters, and all 'people of faith' as phony swindlers in a world without God. On a brighter note, it was very well acted and was a fairly well crafted movie. To this day, I believe Daniel Day Lewis is a superb actor. Without his intensity and talent, it would have been a much lesser movie. It's a good movie and worth seeing, and well acted. I just think the storyline and plot came up a bit short and it is a bit overrated.",7,0,1,10 February 2009
The Waterboy," Oh Come ON!! This was not meant to be high art..just great fun
","All of the characters were well developed and entertaining. This movie never pretended to be anything more than it was..a fun, wacky comedy with a bizarre plot. Anyone who beats this up for being dumb should be taken out back and paddled. It is obvious THEY are too dumb to realize that this was DESIGNED to be dumb. Anyway..there are too many scenes that I STILL laugh at today, even though I have seen this 1/2 dozen times. So, if you are looking for the greatest film ever made on all levels..give this a pass..if you can relate to the humor, it's a wonderful hoot! I am not a die hard Adam Sandler fan, but I think he scored a 10 in this one for likability and laughs.",9,35,47,26 August 2005
Gangs of New York," Daniel Day Lewis was incredible. The movie itself was good
","I think that the character that Daniel Day Lewis portrayed was a masterful piece of acting, and perhaps one of the best dramatic performances I have ever see on the big screen. How versatile is this guy anyway? He can play an Indian, a Brit, and an 19th century scoundrel, as well as a handicapped person. I thought the movie itself was very good from a cinematic standpoint but a little slow at times. Unlike some of the reviews, I thought Cameron Diaz did a really good job in this. I was very underwhelmed by Leo DiCaprio's performance. It came off kind of stiff and uninspired. So..to summarize, I think DDL should have gotten at least a best actor recommended for this. The movie overall was good to very good, Cameron was very good and Leo was a little flat.",7,0,1,17 January 2008
The Pursuit of Happyness," If this movie didn't make you feel something..you need professional help!
","I really didn't have any expectations one way or another about this movie. All the critics raved..the marketing machine hyped it, etc..so I really wasn't expecting much. We put it on at home and the movie captured me very early on, and didn't let me go until the very end. It was a simple movie really, one about a father's unwaivering love for his son, and absolute refusal to give up. It was also all about not blaming others for your misfortune, but doing something about it and improving your own life through your own efforts for the sake of your family and yourself. This was by far my favorite performance from Will Smith. It was a radical departure from his usual smart-alec tough guy role, and was very deep and human. Being a father of 4, and having struggled at many points in my life, I found it deeply touching and could relate to it on an extraordinary number of levels. Well done Mr. Smith. Truly a wonderful movie.",8,0,1,30 January 2008
