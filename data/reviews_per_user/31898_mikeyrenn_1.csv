Walk the Line," Peanut Promise
","This movie made me cry 3 times. I walked out of there crying. I did not cry watching RAY even once. What's good is what gets to you. I can't believe no one has spoken of the best scene in the movie- the peanut teaser- I laughed so hard- it was so warm and real- like really being there in the bed with them watching a private moment. Joaquin did it so exquisitely funny... I laughed my head off while June/Reese screamed, 'John! You're so mean!' I wanna watch the movie again just to see that peanut scene. I can just see John and June telling the script writers about that peanut incident! The only sad thing about the future is, we are never going to get to see Joaquin and Reese sing like that again. If there really is a God we will get to hear Joaquin sing again somewhere sometime somehow. Joaquin will go down in history as the only actor that ever lived that could get you with just one tear. I'm a 60 year old grandmother and I tell you the man is HOT!",Null,1,3,7 December 2005
