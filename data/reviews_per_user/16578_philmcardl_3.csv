The Rock," Rock bottom
","This is a pretty grim piece of effluent. A monument to everything I hate in Hollywood blockbuster trash. Noisy incomprehensible and some of the laziest acting by Sean Connery I've ever seen. The villain (Ed Harris Â– a great actor completely wasted) is a highly-decorated (aren't they all in these sort of movies) US general who has taken over Alcatraz and is threatening to blow up San Francisco Bay area (pity that couldn't have been the Michael Bay area) unless $100 million is paid in ransom, as restitution to families of soldiers who died in secret operations. This is taking our compensation culture too far methinks. But that's Okay then as far as the plot is concerned as at least he's not doing out of any selfish motive and you cannot have a depiction of a really psychotically evil military man these days otherwise you might have the Right Wing reaching for their assault rifles. Of course the only man who can stop him is a geriatric prisoner (arise Sir Sean) a former Alcatraz escapee and you've guessed the rest. This movie is offensives on just about every level. The nadir of this film, which incidentally gave me the biggest snigger, was the line from Connery when he talks about his anxieties about making it sexually unmolested from the prison showers everyday. The idea that any prisoner no matter how perverted would be interested in Connerys flaccid old ass had me hooting. Is Connery now so old and senile as to not see how dumb and funny that line is. Or is it symptomatic of the hubris of elderly superstars that nobody tells you the obvious. Which is sad because Sean Connery always struck me as a pretty grounded individual with few airs (not to mention hairs) and graces?Rent the Sean Connery classic The Hill (1965) to see what a fine actor he can be and get this dire rubbish out of your system.",1,2,17,29 June 2005
2001: A Space Odyssey," Misunderstood masterpiece
","The more I read the often very funny derisory comments on this masterpiece the more I began to realise that most great movies are just generational events that only those alive at the time can truly appreciate the context of their creation.I was 10 when 2001 came out and for some reason the film was classified as an A which at that time meant dragging an adult with me. They didn't 'get it' because it wasn't a character driven drama. Neither did I immediately because of the odd structure of the piece and its mysterious ending. However so overwhelmed was I by the look of the film in those long lost pre-digital effects age, that the obscure finale which initially antagonised me, made me think through the entire film. The 'plotty' bits I liked but when I realised the film, at a second viewing was about the evolution of all of us, as a species, what happened before and what may come after Man the whole non-verbal experience (Kubrick's phrase) had a profound and lasting affect. The speculation of our relative standing against other life forms in the universe (pretty low if the film is to believed) came as a shock. I came out of the cinema reeling with those images of planetary alignments, Ape men discovering the first weapons, revolving balletic space stations the enigmatic star child and the beauty, awesome emptiness, and silence ( George Lucas please note) of space, forever imprinted on my mind to this very day. It fed my conscious and unconscious mind but like now sparked a furious critical onslaught. Those that hated it demanded clarity where there can only ever be conjecture. You never see the aliens that planted the monoliths and that is just as it should be for that element of mystery to remain. 2010 tried to explain everything and killed the effect stone dead. The elegant pacing and use of classical music irritates the hell out of the Michael Bay / MTV generation of who become fidgety if a shot lasts over a second. Witnessing a fuzzy black and white picture on television shortly afterwards that didn't alter for 30 minutes held me spellbound. That was a TV picture of the leg of the lunar module awaiting Neil Armstrong's one small step on the moon. We were used to waiting then, as long as the payoff justified it. This event like the film gave one time to think.And there's the rub, my parent's generation didn't get it and neither does the current one but for widely differing reasons. You really had to be around in 1968 to realise what a quantum leap 2001 represented in film, special effects and story telling techniques. Like all Kubrick films it doesn't date.For me it was a happy accident of time and place, and very grateful I was to be around.",10,29,64,26 June 2005
Titanic," Elephantine disaster
","What is it about James Cameron and women characters in his movies? I've come to the conclusion that they are really all men in skirts. Look at the female characters in Terminator or Aliens they are so butch and testosterone fuelled they aught to have beards and scratch their hairy testicles while chewing tobacco. I mean look what he did to our lovely English rose Kate Winslit in this ship wreck of a movie. He has this alleged Edwardian Lady stick her middle finger up at David Warner at one point and then slugs unconscious some burly crewman who was getting in her way. To top it all she has sex with a total stranger from steerage. Please!! With his tin ear for dialogue he should have stuck to doing thick ear action movies rather than this overly ripe disaster movie. There's an amateurish attempt to demonstrate the stupidity of Ruth's mother having her dismiss some sketches of Picasso (How did they get on board) with the words that he would never amount to anything. Subtle this is not. It looks far better than it sounds which is a great pity as some of the visuals are rather good. One unexpected laugh happened when Cameron picked up his Oscar he screams a line from the film 'I'm the king of the world'. Of course it fell completely flat on the assembled audience, who had never seen this dire movie or had forgotten the execrable script. The poor man must have thought his doggerel was memorable in some way, If this wasn't all bad enough we had to endure Celine Dion terrible song going 'on and on'. The iceberg was the best thing in the movie and should have appeared far earlier than it did.",1,45,180,1 July 2005
