Vertigo," Deep theme
","I have met this movie for the first time. To be honest, I expected this film was kind of horror at the opening, because the screen was so dark, and the sound was terrible. However, in fact, this film shows much deeper thing! I think one of major theme of this film is feminism. I was so surprised to have put a foreshadowing of phallus: stick and the Coit tower. Also Scottie made Judy like Madeline. This description shows power or freedom of men. I intend that 'Vertigo' has accelerated feminism movement later. Then still now, we should have a think about states of women with comparison to men. Actually, I couldn't bring myself to this movie. Because the climax rapidly developed and I couldn't understand this film perfectly. Certainly Judy cheated Scottie and she committed serious crime, but she regretted her sin and she looked to be self -examination. So I was so shocked at the end.",6,0,3,31 July 2017
Room," Based on a true incident
","This film is based on a true incident in 2008. Jack, five years old, long hair lives in 'room' with her mother. They live to cook, clean the room and do physical exercises from day to day. Things in the room are all the world for Jack. Jack thinks what happens on the TV is fancy. Sometimes a strange man comes into the room and leaves some foods. One day his mother, Joy tells Jack the truth. There is a real world outside this room. Jack gets confused, but Joy attempts to escape from the room I think that the real thrill of this film starts since Jack and Joy has get away from the room. How can they accept outside world? How can they get used to live outside world? This theme is so big, principal and deep in this film.",7,0,3,10 August 2017
Psycho," Terrible love
","I have met this movie for the first time. I felt that this movie was the kind of horror all the time, because in a play the multiple murder were repeated and the fact of matter wasn't shown at the end. Moreover, the sound track gave us the feeling of impatience and tension.I think that 'Psycho' and 'Vertigo' have something in common with women. In 'Vertigo' Scottie tried to appropriate Madeline for his personal use by making ideal woman. Whereas in 'Psycho' there is the description comparing women to stuffed birds from Norman's lines. I felt that these express the men's will wanting to make women their own. I wonder if women are passive compared with men is really the case.Also, this film shows strange relationship of gender, because Norman and his mother have the reference of incest in Norman's brain. Of course mother and son are not lover but family by thinking about blood relationship from commonsense. So the love of between parent and child is 'abnormal'. That unusual love invaded Norman's spirit and ate in his heart. That sounds like so terrible.",7,0,0,31 July 2017
The Birds," Consistency of Hitchcock's film
","At first, this film didn't give me any shock, because characters merely talked each other and their speaking and subtitles speed was so fast that I couldn't understand substance in places.  However, the scene suddenly began to change from halfway.  A large number and many kinds of birds attacked on people. I think this film is a little different from other horror films, because even if some ghosts often appear, we might guess their mind by their background.  However, in this film, the birds don't speak anything so we don't be able to find the reason why the birds attack people to the end.  (But possibly, it'll be revenge on human or demand of releasing lovebird.)  So this point is weirdness and frightens us. One of the theme of this film is change of relationship between Melanie and Lydia.  Lydia felt suspicion about Melanie, because Lydia had strange feeling for his son.  In this point incest like 'Psycho' was described in 'The Birds'.  I think there's consistency of theme of women in Hitchcock's film.",7,0,2,2 August 2017
