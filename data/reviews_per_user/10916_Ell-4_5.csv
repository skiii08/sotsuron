The Blair Witch Project," Apologies to Peter Weir
","Several months ago, I critiqued on 'Picnic at Hanging Rock', one of the early films directed by Peter Weir. At that time, though I had not seen it, I had the feeling that that 'The Blair Witch Project' perhaps was somewhat of an imitation of that movie. After just watching Blair Witch Project, I wish to apologize to director Weir for even trying to make a comparison. The only commonality was the permanent disappearance of the actors in both films. The truly splendid 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' was a small sensuous masterpiece with scenery and musical score that brought chills of emotion. 'Blair Witch' was a non-masterpiece of hype. Tell everyone how frightening it is, so they will have to feel frightened. Tell everyone it is as scary as 'The Exorcist' and they will feel guilty if they are not as scared. Tell everyone that this movie was made in only eight days, so they will think--'How incredible' Enough said on that subject. As for hand held cameras, the producers and directors need to take a lesson from some of the Danish film producers who produced 'Mifune' and are dedicated to the use of hand held cameras with a flair and verve that this film could never have. The suspense was so great that, my husband, fell asleep and our ten year old grand daughter said-- 'What a bore'.",1,1,3,27 May 2000
Catch Me If You Can," Nice Change of Pace for Mr. Spielberg
","Don't have a lot to comment about. It certainly was an interesting film considering that it was based on a true story. Also it was good to get away from all the electronic devices used by Mr. Spielberg in his last two films.
Actually my motivation for writing this comment is one of the scenes in the film. I am really wondering whether it hit anyone else as it did me.It took place during the dinner scene in which Leonardo DiCaprio is extolling his virtues to Martin Sheen, the father of his fiancee, who is quite skeptical and gives him a line if questioning. Immediately came to mind a similar scene, at the dinner table,  from the 1972 film 'The Heartbreak Kid'. Charles Grodin is extolling his virtues and line of goods to Eddie Albert, father of Sybil Shephard. Mr. Albert tells our hero afterwards exactly what he thinks of him and from there, of course, the similarity ends.  Would recommend this film, good story and great acting. Tom Hanks is always superior and Christopher Walken should probably  be up for supporting actor. His facial expressions alone were heart rending",7,0,0,30 December 2002
Insomnia," Don't Understand!
","A brief review, not even, as I do not want to compete with the wonderful other 'Users Comments' both positive and negative. They  have all been marvelous. The acting was superb, how can it not be with those magnificent actors? However, the make up artists also deserve a special plaudit for their job on Pacino's insomnia looking countenance. (Or is he just starting to look his age?) So very many movie buffs have been non-plussed by the film and agreed that it was convoluted and disappointing. Why then in 'Rotten Tomatoes' did it get about 109 reviews from the pros????----104 being fresh, and about 6 being smashed. Who's right, the audience or the critics---Again are we dealing with 'The Emperors New Clothes' syndrome.",5,0,0,4 June 2002
Being John Malkovich," Too much hype. Disappointed
","I really wanted to like this movie after reading such wonderful reviews from professional reviewers I covet dearly. Clever, yes, creative yes but a little bit of this and a little bit of that is what I think I saw. The wonderful film 'Cocoon', '2001', 'Alice in Wonderland' all seemed to come together somewhere along with John Malkovich. Where is all this supposed orginality coming from? As I watched the film, I kept being reminded of other films I'd seen. It seems a little like 'The Emporers New Clothes' Due to it's being a different kind of picture, everyone has to say or think, it's different, so it's wonderful. Also,  too bad the genuinely creative puppeteer, had to end up as the 'Heavy'.Despite my disappointment, I must give credit to the actors. They all did a super job.",5,1,2,13 November 1999
Man on the Moon," Touching,insightful film
","At any level; intelligent, brilliantly made, artistic, sensitive and worthy of plaudits for its deeply touching qualities, a must see for movie buffs and those seeking depth of understanding. To me personally, a vital search into my own visual and auditory memories. The question remains, how true are we to ourselves? Is life an existential joke? I left the movie theatre and saw beauty, nostalgia and sadness in the people and the settings that surrounded me. Written by husband of Ell-4 with her loving approval.",10,0,0,23 December 1999
