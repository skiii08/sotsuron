The King's Speech," Visually stunning, beautifully written, fantastically acted; 2nd best film of the year
","Despite all of its lavish production values, The King's Speech greatest asset and strongest suit is its fantastic script, written by David Seidler. In the spirit of his contemporary, Peter Morgan (writer of The Queen, Frost/Nixon and other great films), and also The Social Network, Seidler takes what would seemingly be a very trivial anecdote – King George VI of England's speech therapy sessions – and manages to create a genuinely compelling and fascinating drama out of it. Like Aaron Sorkin's script for The Social Network, Seidler manages to take this unconventional premise and find the classic dramatic arc within it. Structurally, The King's Speech is one of the best screenplays in recent memory. The king is faced with a number of obstacles that he needs to overcome in order to achieve his goal, and as the film goes along and he gets help from the people around him, he learns how to change and eventually moves on. I think that recently, many writers have forgotten about the basic elements of storytelling required to create something truly engaging. Many directors these days rely purely on visuals to tell their stories. But film is just as much a written medium as it is a visual one.However, that isn't to say that The King's Speech doesn't deliver on the visual level as well. Directed with signature flair by up-and-comer Tom Hooper, the film is one of the most visually stunning I have seen all year. Hooper, who has only directed one feature prior to this but enjoyed a very prolific television career, having directed the Elizabeth I mini-series with Helen Mirren as well as the monumental John Adams mini-series for HBO, has, in a relatively short amount of time, managed to develop a very distinct and strikingly beautiful visual style. In this film, he goes all-out with his camera placement and movement: Wide-angle lenses, lengthy steadicam shots, off-center compositions, beautiful settings, gorgeous, naturalistic side-lighting all of these elements come together to create a rich, beautiful, almost Kubrickian visual style. It is exactly the type of visual style I personally enjoy, and it is a thrill to see a director (and cinematographer) take such a loose and dynamic approach to material that otherwise could have come across as very stiff. Of course, the beautiful locations and fantastic and lavish production design and costume design only further compliment the cinematography. Another important element that enriches the dynamics of the film is Alexandre Desplat's beautiful, understated score, which combines his own compositions with fantastic pieces of classical music that really work well to enhance the emotions of the story.In costume dramas, the acting is often just as if not more prominent than the cinematography, costume and set design, and The King's Speech is no exception. At the center of the film are two monumental performances from two of the greatest actors working today: Colin Firth, whom I still believe deserved the Oscar last year for his sublime turn in Tom Ford's A Single Man, and whom I believe deserves the Oscar this year for his equally sublime performance as King George VI. Firth not only embodies and captures the monarch in terms of his stammer and other mannerisms, but also really breathes life and emotion into a man facing a heavy burden, caught in conflict, having to overcome a large number of obstacles including his debilitating stutter but also being belittled by his older brother and father, not having the faith of his people, and needing to win back that faith with the one thing he can't do: public speaking. Complimenting and almost completing his performance is an equally fantastic turn from Geoffrey Rush, who delivers one of his best performances yet as the king's speech therapist. The dynamic between the two of them is one of the best I have seen between two characters in any film this year; they riff and play off one another in just the perfect way, and their initial animosity turned bonding is simply wonderful to watch unfold. Rounding out the supporting cast are wonderful performances from Helena Bonham-Carter as the king's loving wife (and future Queen Mother), and Guy Pearce as King George's snooty, outrageous brother who is more obsessed with his married American socialite girlfriend than with actually doing a good job as monarch. It is a wonderful ensemble that works fantastically well together, and results in some of the best performances of the year.Although I would rank it up there with the likes of The Remains of the Day and Atonement, The King's Speech is also set apart from those movies for one important reason: It is funny, and certainly much funnier than I expected it to be. Some scenes had me in stitches on the floor: the cursing scene will go down as one of the best I have seen in any film this year. Whereas many costume dramas are heavy-handed and feature dreary, down endings, The King's Speech is quite optimistic: characters overcome their obstacles and we are genuinely happy to see them succeed. It almost seems like an oxymoron: A British costume drama crowd-pleaser. But The King's Speech is just that: A wildly enjoyable piece of entertainment, with a heart, a fantastic story and script, and beautiful production values, music and cinematography easily make this one of the best films of the year.",8,6,11,18 December 2010
Changeling," An exquisitely accomplished drama
","As with many of Eastwood's other films, Changeling doesn't hold anything back, emotionally or thematically. Eastwood really bares his teeth here, and delivers as disturbing, frustrating, and aggravating a movie as any of his others. The story on display here, from an original screenplay by TV scribe J. Michael Straczynski, is shocking, infuriating and emotionally draining, and the fact that it's based on a true story lends it even more weight. As I mentioned already, Eastwood really doesn't hold anything back and the first half of the film, during which the protagonist undergoes a series of grueling, torturous events that she is powerless to fight against or to resist, including a stubborn and useless police force, lack of support from any authority figure (at least at first), and her eventual involuntary commitment into an insane asylum even though she is perfectly sane  and if anyone has read anything about insane asylums in the 1920's, they'll know that it wasn't a pretty sight.Uncharacteristically of Eastwood's films, which for the most part are inescapably bleak and offer no form of solace, with the second half of Changeling Eastwood offers us a beacon of hope that well-deserved justice has been served. I won't say that in the end the film is a 'feel-good' movie, because everything leading up to its final act is, in accordance with Eastwood's previous body of work, inescapably bleak and depressing, but Eastwood does provide us with a form of dramatic closure that is rare in his recent body of work.Like all of Eastwood's films, in particular his recent ones, the film looks absolutely stunning; Eastwood shoots in the broad 2.35:1 aspect ratio, not often used in these dramas, and takes full advantage of the breadth it offers him. His cinematography is stark and striking, often utilizing one strong source of light and creating a very chiaroscuro, high-contrast look that really looks absolutely great. Production value is also top notch, and Eastwood captures every little detail of 1920's Los Angeles period with utmost care and attention. The film is also accompanied by a repetitive but very effective score by Eastwood himself that emphasizes the compliments the story and the drama with perfection.Unlike previous films like Unforgiven, Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby, Changeling's cast is for the most part composed of unknowns or character actors. Its only really has two big 'name' actors, but both of them deliver such strong work that it really makes up for it. John Malkovich has a medium-sized supporting role and is as good as ever, perhaps angrier than usual but overall more strong work from the legend. But at the center of the film is the main performance: Angelina Jolie portrays the protagonist who is on screen throughout pretty much the entire movie, and delivers a performance so incredible, so powerful, so commanding and yet so subdued, so with such presence but also with such restraint and submission, that it really amazes me that there are still people out there that doubt her skills and abilities as an actress. Sure, she won the Oscar for her supporting role in Girl, Interrupted, but that was mostly for show; last year she delivered a far more accomplished and absolutely stunning performance in A Mighty Heart that was for the most part unjustly overlooked; hopefully she'll get her due this year for her amazing, incredible performance in Changeling. It's the best performance of her career, and one of the strongest leading female performances of the year.Overall, Changeling is an exquisitely accomplished drama: It tells a fascinating true story that is compelling to follow, and yet, Eastwood treats it far less like a mystery thriller as one would expect and far more as an in-depth character drama. Eastwood holds no emotion back and lets us feel a wide variety of emotions, from anger to frustration to hopelessness to sympathy, and Angelina Jolie, in the best show of her career, delivers a truly amazing, incredibly well-acted performance, playing her small character with such introverted restraint that it just emphasizes her presence in the film even more. I fail to understand how so many critics were emotionally detached from this film, as I felt it very hard to remain aloof in front of the film's deep emotions. Its mixed critical reaction renders it, in my opinion, as one of the more underrated movies of the year. In the end, Eastwood and co. deliver a fascinating, emotional melodrama while managing to skip over the melodrama and elevate the film to subtler, more naturalistic place.",8,6,9,11 January 2009
Frost_Nixon," Excellent, entertaining, engrossing - the story speaks for itself
","The subject matter of the film pretty much carries itself. The filmmakers have selected an historic event so effortlessly fascinating that a subtle, restrained docudrama approach works very effectively. I haven't seen the original stage play on which the film is based, but I can only assume that it focuses more on the stage-friendly interviews sequence and less on the depiction of the whirlwind events leading up to the interviews, which occur over extended periods of time and in many locations which the film jumps from very rapidly. In order to bring order to the chaos, screenwriter Peter Morgan, also the playwright of the original stage version, employs a very effective technique of splicing within the film interviews with the characters in the film, taking place some time after the Frost/Nixon interviews but, unlike those ones, are not based on real interviews which occurred in real life but rather are the fruit of Morgan's imagination. It's certainly far more original and interesting a way to portray characters' inner thoughts, to deliver important information quickly and to arrange all the events in the audience members' heads than to use voice-over narration, for example. The film's structure altogether allows for an almost constant drama; the second half focuses on the actual interviews, which are of course naturally dramatic, but the first half depicts the equally interesting behind-the-scenes events, providing us with fantastic character development of both David Frost and Richard Nixon and also with the inherent dramas of Frost's being ridiculed, claims he wouldn't be up to the challenge, his difficulty in securing funds and his descent into an obsession with the interviews while still managing to keep his cool and never lose his focus or stability.Howard and Brian Grazer's production value is second to none; all the elements in this film come together wonderfully, including excellent cinematography from Howard regular (since Cinderella Man) Salvatore Totino and an extremely effective musical score by Hans Zimmer. But it's undeniable, perhaps because of its roots on the stage, that the centerpiece of the film is the acting. Aided by a stellar supporting cast including familiar faces such as Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, Toby Jones and Rebecca Hall, the two pillars of acting, the tent poles of the film, are Michael Sheen and Frank Langella, each of whom delivers an outstanding, truly striking performance, with one ever-so-slightly overshadowing the other. Frank Langella absolutely dominates the role as Richard Nixon. I haven't seen many other films depicting the former president, the most famous of which is probably Oliver Stone's Nixon which features Anthony Hopkins in an interesting, heart-felt and yet slightly off performance, and yet I say with confidence that Langella's performance is the greatest and most convincing cinematic depiction of 'Tricky Dick' yet. Langella nails two very important aspects of depicting a real-life, public individual: the first is perfecting his mannerisms, physical look and voice, which he does outstandingly well. But what differentiates between an imitation and a performance is when you take those mannerisms and that accent and apply them to any dramatic setting. Langella does this so expertly that it's simply a treat just to watch him getting angry and emotional as Nixon. And yet, Langella, Morgan and Howard take special care not to portray Nixon as a total monster; they manage, very carefully, to craft a very full-bodied, rounded character with immense depth and personal drama; the storm brewing behind Langella's eyes, the inner turmoil of Nixon, is utterly spellbinding.Delivering an equally solid performance but perhaps overshadowed by Langella's towering turn is Michael Sheen as David Frost. Like Langella, Sheen is in the position of portraying a real-life public figure, speaking with an accent, perfecting mannerisms and applying the imitation to drama, but perhaps because Nixon is such a more instantly recognizable and even legendary figure to audiences than David Frost is, Langella seems to be taking all the critics' attention away from the equally deserving Sheen. This is the second time in as many years that Sheen has delivered an excellent performance portraying a real-life figure in a film only to be overshadowed by the other lead role: In 2006's The Queen, incidentally also written by Peter Morgan, Sheen played an expertly rounded, deep, fascinating version of Tony Blair only to be completely overshadowed by Helen Mirren's towering performance as Queen Elizabeth II come awards season. Even though it may not win any Oscars or even be nominated for one, I only hope that Sheen will take solace in knowing that his work is appreciated by many, and his performance in Frost/Nixon in particular is a great achievement.Frost/Nixon is an excellent, entertaining, engrossing film that works on so many levels and features so many facets that all come together in an excellent example of film-making. Howard, Morgan and crew managed to take a subject that many would consider heavy-handed or irrelevant, and still make it irresistibly entertaining and fascinating to watch. The dramas of the behind-the-scenes build-up to the interviews is as dramatic and captivating as the interviews themselves, and Howard manages to avoid his previous pitfall off an overly melodramatic finale by ending the film on a subtler, more realistic but still powerful conclusion. Morgan and actors Langella and Sheen manage to take two very public figures and craft multi-faceted, deep, three-dimensional characters with very well developed personalities and qualities, with Sheen and especially Langella delivering absolutely riveting performances. And throughout it all is director Ron Howard, conducting the orchestra, stepping back and letting every element of the film  the talented technical crew, absorbing story and interesting characters  speak for itself.",8,2,4,12 December 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Average; the beginning of the inevitable decline of the superhero genre
","If the most commonly remembered generalization of the film output of the 1980's is teen comedies with synthesized soundtracks, the 2000's will be most remembered and generalized as the decade of the comic book movies. I have no specific qualms with the genre, quite the contrary: I think there are a handful of superhero films that are conversely at the top of their game and major recent plus points for the action-adventure genre, and this Summer also brought us the genre's greatest output, The Dark Knight. Great films like Batman Begins, X2 and Spider-Man 2 were countered by pretty lousy adaptations like Elektra and Fantastic Four, but it is The Incredible Hulk, I think, that signifies the beginning of the end for the genre.The movie itself isn't really bad by any means at all, certainly not like Fantastic Four. Much effort has been put into both production value and telling a quality story while avoiding camp and cheesiness. Special effects are top-notch and there are plenty of grand, crowd-pleasing set pieces and action sequences that really keep the ball rolling. On the other hand, an effort has been made to attempt to keep the movie in a semi-realistic setting: sure, there are fantastical elements such as gene-altering radiation, superhuman creatures like Hulk and Abomination, far-fetched and fantastical military technology and other such things, but like Spider-Man 2 these factors are regulated to a realistic setting, avoiding the camp and altogether silliness that abound films such as Joel Schumacher's Batman films or Elektra. Marvel's taking over of their film properties and self-producing the blockbusters seems to indicate an increase in the quality of the productions, as the Marvel producers take pride in their creations, treat them with respect and take them very seriously.As with this summer's Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk has also managed to attract to itself a major star who is not usually associated with this type of work and who takes it seriously. Edward Norton brings a little something else to the table, and it is evident that he tries his best to do the most with the Bruce Banner character and make him as believable and accessible as possible, without much success as the script basically requires him to sleepwalk through the Banner scenes as preludes to the centerpiece Hulk sequences. The rest of the supporting cast are strong as well, with such heavyweights as William Hurt and Tim Roth rounding it all out and bringing in their own signature styles and commanding presences.Hollywood has already attempted to bring Marvel's Hulk character to the big screen once before, resulting in one of the most polarizing comic book movies ever made. Some people can't stand a minute of Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk movie, while others praise it and see its merit through the flaws. I belong in the second group, and furthermore feel like the two Hulk movies really complete one another. While Ang Lee's film was indefinitely flawed, both in its special effects work and in its ridiculously over-the-top set pieces that really took away from the experience, from a Hulk poodle attack to the terrible final showdown with Nick Nolte's villain. But on the other hand, the characterization and character development in the film was among the strongest of any superhero movie yet. Banner was made out as someone out of a Shakespearian tragedy  wrongfully accused, misunderstood, thrust into a situation against his will. He is not exhilarated from his powers but rather afraid, mortified of them. We are also treated to the revelation that Bruce and Betty Ross' relationship revolves around their both having fathers they couldn't count on, although both of their fathers are featured in the film and are shown as caring and compassionate as well as monstrous and abusive.On the other hand, Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk serves as an anti-thesis to Lee's film. While Lee's film was weak on the action scenes, Leterrier's film excels in them, portraying them as realistic, gritty and thrilling, and avoiding camp altogether. Unfortunately, this seems to come at the expense of character development, even though Edward Norton really tries his best to up the ante.Now, I would like to bring this back to my initial point, and explain why The Incredible Hulk marks the beginning of the inevitable decline of the superhero comic book adaptation genre. While Iron Man benefited from a sense of fun and Robert Downey, Jr.'s irresistible charm, and The Dark Knight was something in a completely different league, The Incredible Hulk, which was released in theatres right between the two other comic book juggernauts, comes across as frightfully run-of-the-mill: good, well-made, but bringing absolutely nothing new to the table. With Marvel studios lining up feature films for Thor, Captain America, Ant-Man and Nick Fury, as well as one massive The Avengers film bringing together all their independently produced film characters, it can very easily be seen that unless each film takes a completely unique standpoint and brings something really special and new to the table, they will all start feeling redundant really fast and really soon. Also, what after The Avengers? There aren't nearly enough comic book superheroes to bankroll endless comic book adaptation films, and there can only be so many sequels  both the X-Men and Spider-Man franchises crashed-and-burned whatever quality they had by film 3, Superman is already washed up, Christopher Nolan probably won't make any more than one more Batman film, and who knows how successful Marvel's upcoming, lesser-known superhero movies will fare. The Incredible Hulk, featuring a fairly universally known hero, didn't fare too well at the box office, which leaves the future of the genre, at least in my opinion, pretty clear.",6,1,4,18 October 2008
3:10 to Yuma," A brilliant character study; an old-fashioned Western with a modern twist
","As beloved as it is, it cannot be denied that the Western is a dead genre, and for justified reasons. The same all-American clear-as-crystal stark morality of good versus evil that attracted us to the comic book superheroes of the second World War period also drew us to the heroic endeavors of the old American frontiersmen who explored and developed the far west. Ethics in the classic Westerns were simple: The good, honest men wore white and always defeated the bad, criminal men who wore black in a showdown. One could almost say that the old Westerns glorified the post-Civil War western frontier, which truly was a dark, difficult, and dangerous life for those who chose to live it. But this kind of morality quickly wore off, and when America turned to more complex super-heroes so the stark good-versus-evil morals of the Western genre began to outstay its welcome. Since then, Westerns saw only one other renaissance in the form of the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60's, whose morals were present but somewhat twisted. Since the 60's the Western genre saw few resurgences, the last one in the turn-of-the-90's with Kevin Costner's epic Dances with Wolves and Clint Eastwood's opus, Unforgiven. And now, we have another resurfacing of the genre with 2005's The Proposition and 2007's 3:10 To Yuma and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.What is so good about these modern-day Westerns is that they are just that; old-fashioned stark morality is replaced by modern-day foggy-lined morals; 3:10 To Yuma provides an exquisite example of these plays on morality. Here is a hero that just wants to scrape by his simple farm life and performs heroic acts for selfish reasons only  erasure of debts, monetary reward, and his family's well being. Here is a villain who is obviously superiorly intelligent than his crew of cutthroats and who seems more preoccupied with bible verses and drawing sketches of nature than a life of crime. It's every man for himself, just like it was in the actual frontier.I must admit, I haven't seen the 1957 original, but James Mangold does an exquisite job in his re-make/re-imagination. Although the film is overall old-fashioned, it still features many modern film-making techniques aside from the blurry morality of the brilliant screenplay and the down-and-dirty depiction of Wild Western life. Hand-held cameras and very modern-styled action photography are wonderfully employed, and in general the cinematography is a wonder to behold; naturalistic while managing to be stimulatingly beautiful. Mangold also directs like a modern director, allowing his brilliant actors to explore their characters and deliver powerhouse performances full of nuance and subtlety.Indeed the entire ensemble cast can be mentioned in good light, especially supporting actors Peter Fonda as the scarred, craggy old bounty hunter who is one of the best examples of blurry morality in the film; in this chapter of his life he is under contract for the 'good guys', but we learn that he has had no problem in the past murdering women and children; and Ben Foster, who delivers a truly scenery-chewing and brilliant performance as outlaw Ben Wade's clearly deranged right-hand man. But the true wonder lies in the film's two top-billed actors, among the best of their generation: Christian Bale and Russell Crowe.The two plays off one another to absolute, pitch-perfect brilliance, and both manage to find the niches of both of their characters. It's wonderfully fascinating to watch how Crowe plays Wade as enjoying his playful-but-deadly manipulations of the party accompanying him to the train that will take him to Yuma prison to be tried and hanged. Only Bale's Dan Evans can provide the proper contrast to this, as his straight-man routine is coupled with obvious intelligence. He seems out of place in this landscape and we learn that he was originally from Massachusetts but was forced to move to the dry weather of the western frontier due to his young son's illness. For someone with so much to lose, we the audience  and even the characters in the film, including Evans himself  don't know exactly why he is so stubborn in delivering Wade to the train. Is all the trouble really worth the $200 reward? Or is Evans simply trying to prove something to his wayward eldest son who doesn't have faith in his father, who is embarrassed to tell him the tragically un-heroic way he lost his leg in the Civil War. The 'battle of wits' reaches a climax as the two sit in a hotel room near the end of the film, waiting patiently for the train to arrive. The little conversation they have is rather banal, but we learn so much from the characters just by seeing how Evans is willing to open himself up to the outlaw, and how Wade listens intently to his story.Like the greatest intelligent movies, 3:10 To Yuma is a character study of the kind that the characters don't have one simple trait that identifies them but rather are three-dimensional, fleshed out human beings who fascinate us with their unclear intentions, fears, regrets, mistakes and quirks. The film is incredibly well acted from its ensemble cast in general and its two stars in particular, and Mangold truly delivers the goods on the directing plane with his old-fashioned film-making with a modern twist in terms of the cinematography and action directing. This is a fascinating, realistic and brutally honest portrayal both of the 19th century Western frontier and of the morality of men, and is an extremely satisfying, entertaining and well-made film in general.",8,2,4,6 December 2007
I'm Not There," A fascinating pastiche of mixed feelings, emotions and identities
","Just as Julie Taymor's musical Across the Universe attempted (and for the most part succeeded) in existing as an embodiment, a spiritual extension of the Beatles songs it features, I'm Not There exists as a startling and beautiful combination of two artists, two artistic branches. The film serves as a spiritual embodiment of the folksy, traditional sound combined with the new-wave, idealistic, poetic, psychedelic lyrics of Dylan's music. Combining the bizarre with the poetic with the beautiful with the traditional, the film manages to paint a portrait of Dylan beyond a simple depiction of his life and the various events that fill it, although the film does an incredibly well and imaginative job of doing that as well.In another move channeling the spirit of Bob Dylan, Haynes splits up his subject into six characters, each embodying a different aspect of the singer-songwriter or, in some cases, a different period in Dylan's career. It is a wonderfully imaginative gimmick previously employed by none other than Todd Solondz in his film Palindromes, that works outstandingly well to serve Haynes' purpose.Uncharacteristic of pure independent film (a movement to which I'm Not There undeniably belongs, having not been produced by a studio specialty division such as Focus Features or Paramount Vantage but rather truly independently produced), Hanyes is blessed with an all-star cast, so much so that some of them seem underused, such as Julianne Moore. Christian Bale delivers a startling restrained performance as a closed, reclusive version of Dylan, expertly done and surprising considering his knack for showmanship in most of his previous roles. Richard Gere delivers a similarly restrained, laid-back performance. Newcomer Marcus Carl Franklin does a surprisingly poignant, life-filled and energetic job as the young blues player with wisdom far beyond his years. But the film's two centerpiece performances are also its most prominently featured. Cate Blanchett does an absolutely, indescribably phenomenal job and delivers what is by far the best performance of the film. The incredible bravery and novelty of a female actress playing a male character in a non-comedic film aside, Blanchett does an uncanny job reminiscent of her Oscar-winning role as Katherine Hepburn, by effortlessly combining imitation with deep, resonant, revealing characterization. Blanchett doesn't miss a quirk, capturing Dylan's look, mannerisms and speech spot-on, while also managing to allow the true inner soul of her character seep out  the emptiness, the loneliness, the hopelessness. Heath Ledger delivers a similarly affecting, masterful performance as a Dylan strident in is values and weighed down by his fame at one end and family life at the other. It is a role that further increases the tragedy of Ledger's recent death, directly continuing his momentous tendency of increasingly complex, challenging and ultimately fulfilling and skillful performances since his amazing turn in Brokeback Mountain. It is so sad for the life of such a promising young actor whose talent was only just starting to bloom to be cut off so suddenly and under such tragic circumstances. His passing was quite a shame.In the spirit of true independent film, Haynes conducts a fascinating experiment with I'm Not There, creating a pastiche of mixed feelings, emotions and identities. Creating a unique musician biography picture by splitting his subject into 6 separate characters and not mentioning his name once, Haynes goes even further and has his film feature a wondrous combination of art forms, coexisting with Dylan's work and functioning as a truly imaginative amalgamation of music and film. Sometimes it may seem that Haynes' experimenting goes a little too far, and it is easy for me to see how the film would confuse the average moviegoer not familiar with Dylan's life and work. Featuring everything from sped-up psychedelic binges to feral dreams and visions to wild animals literally walking the streets, it is an undeniably bizarre piece of work, with some of its events and twists entirely devoid of a logical explanation whatsoever  although perhaps this is yet another aspect of Dylan integrated into the film. Vividly stylized and beautifully shot, the all-star cast also works to the film's advantage and provides it with yet another layer of interest. And of course, what's a musical bio-pic without the music; accompanied by a wide array of Bob Dylan's songs, from all his different periods and performed by various artists including prominently, and naturally, Dylan himself, the music provides the final element of the film's ultimate goal to embody, personify, and channel the spirit of Bob Dylan. While it may not always work, for the most it is a wonderfully imaginative, strikingly visual, unique and surprisingly epic piece of independent film, sealing Hayne's place as a truly visionary directorial force whose work should be reckoned with.",8,2,3,30 January 2008
Star Trek," Big, fun, entertaining - has it all and more
","I think that the major reason the film is so good, enjoyable and successful, is because it manages to achieve something that few summer blockbusters manage to achieve, except for the few occasional exceptions, such as Iron Man last summer and Transformers the summer before that: Abrams' Star Trek is not afraid of comedy. Sure, it delivers in all the other facets that summer blockbusters are expected to deliver in – top-notch special effects, breathtaking set pieces and thrilling, heart-pounding action scenes – but where Star Trek succeeds where few other summer blockbusters do is that for every tense, high-octane action set piece, there is also a loose, relaxed and absolutely laugh-out-loud hilarious scene to go with it. I don't think it's coincidental that this film was written by the same screen writing duo that wrote Transformers a couple of years back, as they injected that film with a lot of intentional comedy as well. And yet, just as the likes of Shia LaBeouf, Anthony Anderson and John Turturro carried and delivered much of the comedy in Transformers, I believe that much of the comedic success of Star Trek lies on the cast.And a truly wonderful cast it is – and an eclectic one at that. Looking over the cast list, one might wonder what all these actors have to do with one another – I mean who thought he'd ever see Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Eric Bana, Winona Ryder and Leonard Nemoy in the same movie together? And yet, it works, and be it a testament to J.J. Abrams' directorial chops or the actors' own skills, the cast members all have truly great chemistry with one another. The film will undoubtedly make stars of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, both of whom prove quite impressive skills in the film. The dynamic between their characters is crucial to the film and really builds its emotional backbone, and it could have easily been a hit-and-miss thing had Abrams made the wrong casting choices. Luckily, he took two genuine talents, both of which play their well-defined characters quite well, nailing all of their personality quirks and mannerisms and truly embodying their characters. That said, the most entertaining performances derive from the supporting characters, and a few actors in particular totally steal the show from the otherwise first-rate cast. First up is Eric Bana, who delivers a particularly juicy, scenery-chewing performance as Nero, the film's villain. Next we have young Anton Yelchin, who delivers what is probably the second funniest and most enjoyable performance of the whole lot, truly nailing the quirky mannerisms of his character. But the scene-stealing crown belongs undeniably to Simon Pegg, who is an inherently funny guy as it is, but with a thick Scottish drawl, manages to be even more so than usual.One cannot discuss a major science fiction-action epic such as this without mentioning its technical aspects, specifically its special effects. Based on this movie and also the apparent quality of the special effects work as seen in the trailers for some other upcoming summer blockbusters, namely Terminator Salvation, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, it seems like 20 years after The Abyss, CGI imagery has finally reached its peak. The quality of these effects has been quite varied these past few years – for every Transformers and Harry Potter there's a Spiderman or a Star Wars prequel – but with Star Trek at least, nothing can really be said about the CGI other than that ILM and Digital Domain did a fantastic job and that the effects look 100% real and convincing. The spaceships are sleek and shiny, environment extensions are completely seamless, and the adrenaline-pumping space battles are dynamic and exciting – all CGI. Luckily, though, Abrams did not follow in many of his mentors' footsteps, and still managed to show an appreciation of real, practical sets, instead of setting his film in entirely CGI environments. Also worth mentioning is the simply fantastic sound design and editing by Ben Burtt, who was robbed of a pair of Oscars in the sound categories at the Academy Awards last year for his unparalleled work in WALL-E, but who hopefully will get his due this year come the Oscars.I wanted a no-holds-barred, hits-the-ground-running, pure and untainted summer blockbuster entertainment, and an entertainment I did receive. J.J. Abrams has this uncanny ability of knowing just what his audience wants to see, and delivering something even better. Although not really a re-boot as it retains much from its original source material both in terms of the content and characters but also because the plot actually manages to integrate it into the continuity of the show, this Star Trek movie still does deviate greatly from its campy roots, and is very much a completely and utterly modern, up-to-date work of science fiction. The action is bigger and better, the effects work is remarkable, the design, look and feel of this well-established world is all updated to meet the most current standards, and the characters and film itself all have a certain manner and attitude that wholly defines our era. Big explosions, impressive visuals, space battles, thrills, excitement, edge-of-your seat tension – Abrams' latest summer blockbuster has it all and more, and all that, added together with some really hilarious (and frequent) comic relief and some great performances and character dynamics and chemistry, serves to deliver a great summer entertainment, just a genuinely fun time at the movies and an early candidate for the title of best film of the summer",8,2,12,9 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino remains a force to be reckoned with
","Inglourious Basterds still features that unique Tarantino voice that rings out from the dialogue, the non-linear storyline (in this case division into chapters, much like Kill Bill), the virtuoso camera work and, of course, the prominent soundtrack. And yet, it is a film that also incorporates a lot of firsts for the director. First and most prominently, it is Tarantino's first period-set film. Which is surprising, considering how his movies all feature throwbacks to genres and styles associated with past decades. Despite this, Tarantino's scripts are always very heavy on pop culture references, and so it was definitely interesting to see him take his exceedingly modern and contemporary writing style and apply it to a period film. The results are a fantastic and fascinating mix of old and new; there are no direct anachronisms per se, but the characters in the film do speak in a very 'hip' and modern style that nobody in the 40's would possibly speak in. In fact, the dialogue is great and unique because nobody would speak it today either – it carries that certain Tarantino quality to it that's hard to put a finger on but that provides his greatest and most unique stamp. And yet, despite its utter disconnection from anything remotely realistic, Tarantino does make one conscious decision that lends the film more realism than most others in its genre: he chooses to have foreign characters speak their dialogue in their native language, which results in a vast majority of it spoken in French or German with subtitles. It's actually quite reassuring to see a mostly-subtitled film such as this one still be very successful at the box office, since many pundits (and Hollywood producers for that matter) seem to think that subtitled films don't sell.It's not just the dialogues that are succulent and well-written in the film, but it's the scenes themselves. The film is actually very uniquely structured, featuring very few scenes overall, but long ones that take their time building up. The scene in the basement pub stands out in particular as a simply brilliantly constructed scene lasting over 20 minutes, starting out slow and establishing the dialogue and characters, and slowly building up to a brilliant climax which I will not go into detail about here, but suffice it to say that it ends in a set-up that Tarantino has used before. Without going into too much detail, the set-up is tied in with the style of the film in general. Despite it being a WWII-set war film, the film is constructed and stylized much more like a Western, from the parallel plot lines building up to a single climax to the soundtrack composed almost entirely by Ennio Morricone arrangements (another potential first for Tarantino – Morricone was originally supposed to provide Tarantino with his first original score, but eventually he ended up using old cues from past scores by the legendary composer). This all serves to create a fascinating, genre-bending script that straddles Nazisploitation, Spaghetti Western and Tarantino's own unique style.Ultimately, the most fascinating aspect about this film is just how audacious it turns out to be. Without going into too much detail, by the end of the film Tarantino completely changes and disregards history as we know it, to a point that the film itself becomes this big, epic fantasy. Its reception in Israeli was consequently uneven. Many critics derided it for taking an insensitive attitude towards what is probably the most serious and atrocious event in modern history, the Holocaust, and for reducing it to a schlocky Jewish revenge fantasy. Despite the critics, the film has gone on to become one of the most popular and successful films currently playing in Israeli cinemas, and the public reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. I think that stylistically and story-wise, the film isn't quite up there with Pulp Fiction and perhaps not even with Kill Bill, but in terms of Tarantino's ambition and where he ends up taking it, the film becomes one of his most fascinating ventures. It's thrilling, well-made, impeccably shot (by Robert Richardson, a Tarantino veteran and one of the best cinematographers working today), fantastically acted, irresistibly entertaining, absolutely hilarious, and in all it's just a big, epic, audacious and unique piece of entertainment that reminds us, in case we have forgotten, that Tarantino is a force to be reckoned with.",9,2,12,15 October 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Great sense of humour and charm elevate this above the average rom-com
","Judd Apatow has done the impossible. He has crafted, over the past few years, a series of movies that have sealed his name as a franchise; just as the name Quentin Tarantino attached to a crime movie means something to the movie going crowd, as such has Judd Apatow's name attached to a comedy become to mean something similar. Whether he's directing or just producing, Apatow and his troupe of actors, many of which appeared on his early, short-lived and underrated television program 'Freaks and Geeks' bring a certain something more to the otherwise average romantic comedy genre.Indeed, like most of the previous movies attached to his name, Forgetting Sarah Marshall features a fairly simple, typical set-up and storyline for a romantic screwball comedy: A man is dumped by his girlfriend and he decides to take a vacation at the same resort his girlfriend and her new man are vacationing at, all the while falling in love with another girl who is clearly far more perfect for him. But Apatow, or in this case, his faithful troupe of actors, give the film a little something more that elevates it above other average comedies. That certain something is a sense of down-to-earthiness, crafting real, fleshed-out characters that most of us can fairly easily identify with  because they are essentially playing themselves, which is more than often famous, older versions of us  funny, awkward, movie-loving geeks.In continuing with his trend of giving lead starring roles to the actors who appeared on Freaks and Geeks and in small but hilarious supporting roles in his films  last year the breakthrough leading role was given to Seth Rogen  Forgetting Sarah Marshall stars Jason Segel, who finally gets a chance to showcase his true talent, and he certainly impresses. Besides delivering a hilarious, poignant performance in the film, Segel wrote not only the film's screenplay but also the numerous original songs that appear throughout it, including the musical numbers to the Dracula puppet musical. I can only hope that Segel will enjoy a slightly more mainstream success just like Seth Rogen has been since the release of Knocked Up last summer.But the real show-stealers are the various members of the supporting cast. First off, the Apatow regulars Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd and Bill Hader who are funny as ever with their quick-witted, probably mostly improvised comedic performances and who provide the flair and the extra punch with their supporting turns. Next up are the totally different, very British comedic styles of Russell Brand. Anyone who has seen The Big Fat Quiz of the Year will know that his performance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall is just a taste of his comedic brilliance. And then there is Mila Kunis, who takes a sharp 90-degree turn from the annoying loudmouth character of Jackie Burkhart as seen on That 70's Show and who personifies absolutely the sweetest most lovable girl possible. Kristen Bell is okay but probably the most uninspired casting in the film.In all, a very particular and absolutely hilarious sense of humour, along with a level of charm and believability elevate this film above the average romantic comedy.",7,2,8,15 June 2008
Spider-Man 2," A superb improvement on the first film
","This movie excels both as a comic book movie, and a sequel. It's definitely one of the best comic book movies of all time (although I don't think anything will be able to beat X2 and the first two Batman movies). Not only is it an excellent sequel (which isn't that common to begin with), it's also one of those rare sequels that is actually better than the first film (other examples are Aliens, Terminator 2 and X2).Almost everything in this film is better than in the original Spider-Man. I'll start with the most significant example: the characters. The character development in this movie is absolutely fantastic, easily comparable to the X-Men movies. It's never been easier to identify with Peter Parker. I've always wondered how super-heroes managed to balance their real lives and their super-hero lives like it seems that they do. Spider-Man 2 shows us that it's not as simple as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Clark Kent/Superman make it seem. In fact, Peter Parker struggles so hard to maintain both his real life and his crime fighting life, eventually he gives in and realizes that he has to choose one path or the other (he realizes this with the help of a wonderful speech from Aunt May (Rosemary Harris)). Mary Jane's character is also much deeper than it was in the first film. While it may seem that she's given up on Peter and found love somewhere else, the truth is far from that. Not only is she not sure if she still loves Peter or not, it's also apparent that she still hasn't forgotten that one kiss she shared with Spider-Man in the first film. Alfred Molina's character, Doctor Octavius (or Doc Ock), is one of the most believable villains in any movie. His character is completely three-dimensional, something relatively rare for an on-screen villain. We can see exactly where he's coming from, why he does the things he does. He's not the usual two-dimensional villain, who is just there to oppose the hero. The only other villain as three-dimensional as Doctor Octopus, off the top of my head, is Bill in Kill Bill (although there are no doubt many others like this).The action and CGI has improved tremendously since the first film. While the CGI in the original Spider-Man was always a bit iffy in my eyes, they've clearly done a much better job. The combination of real footage and CGI is almost unnoticeable, and it's virtually impossible to tell the difference between the CGI Spider-Man and the real Spider-Man costume (except that the CGI Spider-Man does things that Tobey Maguire would never be able to do). Doc Ock's tentacles definitely stand out as an amazing CGI achievement in this film. They look excellent. The action is stunning. While, for an action film, the action is relatively scarce, when it kicks in, it does it magnificently. Spider-Man's fight with Doctor Octopus on the train is one of the most exciting and amazingly executed action scenes I've seen (not comparable to the action in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or in The Matrix Reloaded, but it's close).Sam Raimi, director, does an absolutely brilliant job. His intentionally corny approach is what really stands out in this film  it never really takes itself too seriously. He also uses some low budget b-movie trademarks, such as quick zooms and corny one-liners. While some people don't like this approach, I thought it was brilliant. Raimi returns to his roots (in a way) with his directing style. His style of shooting is very reminiscent to his earlier films in the Evil Dead series. One of the most significant examples of this is the scene with Dr. Octopus in the hospital room, which was absolutely brilliant. The camera angles, and some of the elements (such as the nurse scraping the floor with her fingernails), are pure Evil Dead.There were all sorts of little bits and details, really tiny ones, that made the particular scene they were in worthwhile. For instance, the lady playing the violin in the street is singing the theme song to the original Spider-Man cartoon from the '60s. Another great reference was in the hospital room scene. While the entire sequence is reminiscent of The Evil Dead, the shot of the hand on the floor still holding the chainsaw is an obvious reference to an identical shot in The Evil Dead II. Brilliant.To sum it all up, this movie is a superb improvement on the first film (which was excellent, don't get me wrong). Sam Raimi clearly focused more on the story and the characters this time, which was wonderful. Unfortunately, some things could have still been worked on. For instance, the general structure of the film is very reminiscent of the sequels to other comic book movies, namely Superman II and Batman Returns (the whole 'abandoning the hero role' thing). And still, while it's also an extremely entertaining flick, Spider-Man 2 has much more behind it than just crowd-pleasing. It's definitely one of the best movies of the year so far, but we have yet to see what the second half of 2004 has in store for us. Recommended for anyone, even people who aren't into the whole comic book movie scene.",8,1,2,27 October 2005
127 Hours," Danny Boyle's best film
","There are two main elements that make this story seem like it would never work as a narrative film. Firstly, everyone knows the ending. The film is based on a very widely reported true story that almost everyone seems to know about or at least heard about in passing. And so, must people go into the film knowing how it is going to end. Boyle and company faced a very major obstacle they needed to get over: how will they keep their audience interested in a story they already know the outcome of? In addition, there is the entire notion of dramatic structure. And when you have a story that takes place almost entirely with one character who has his hand stuck under a rock, your dramatic options seem relatively limited. Aside from the one major conflict that is set up very early on, there doesn't seem to be any room for development, further conflict, complications, additional obstacles, or any kind of change whatsoever. The character is quite literally and physically stuck. How do you make this compelling?Firstly, Boyle's visual style does a pretty good job at keeping us interested. Continuing his streak with Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle, along with cinematographers Anthony Dodd Mantle and Enrique Chediak create an absolutely beautiful and rich visual palette, with dynamic camera movements and angles, beautiful framing and use of color, use of different kinds of cameras for different visual styles – consumer-grade digital cameras to get that extreme depth of field and to have objects literally pressed right up against the lens in crisp focus; wide-angle lenses, fascinating point-of-view shots and other elements that all serve to create this incredibly intense and visceral cinematic experience. The vibrant editing also does its job, with very quick, rapid-fire cuts and some of the best and most unique use of split-screen imagery I've ever seen further adding to the film's unique visual style.So how does Boyle create dramatic tension in a movie about a man who spends the entire time with his hand stuck under a rock in an isolated canyon? Easy – he takes us out of the canyon. After the accident, which occurs fairly early on in the story, the film's linear reality begins to fragment, and we begin to see what Aron begins to see. Fascinatingly enough, the film never quite makes it clear what we are seeing are flashbacks, visions and premonitions hallucinated by Aron in his desperate situation, or a combination of the two. The fact that the film blurs these lines makes the experience all the more visceral and puts us even further and deeper into Aron's head. The dynamic style of the film as well as the extremely subjective point of view it puts us in helps to create this inescapable feeling of intensity and dread as the film progresses – it is quite simple one of the most intense and nerve-racking films I have ever experienced. Our connection with the character is so strong and the style so inescapable that even events that we know will happen make us feel nervous and uncomfortable. You really start thinking: there is just absolutely no other way out of this situation, and as this truth becomes more and more obvious to Aron, the feeling of dread only intensifies and intensifies leading up to the horrifically graphic climax. When I first heard about this project, I didn't know if there was anything that could be done. And yet, Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy found an absolutely brilliant way to get around these problems, and ended up creating one of the most compelling films I have had the pleasure to see this year. By removing us from the canyon, the film ceases to be about a character with his hand stuck under a rock, and becomes a film about the character himself. What makes Aron tick? What happened to him to get him in this situation to begin with, and what does he have inside him that drives him to commit this insanely desperate and courageous act he commits at the end, one which my friends and I deliberated for hours whether or not we would be capable of doing, only to reach the conclusion that there is no way in the world we would be able to do what Aron did if we found ourselves in a similar situation. We see Aron interacting with other people, and pushing them away. We see him leisurely ignoring his friendly boss as he leaves the store he works at before he leaves for his hiking trip. We see him ignoring his mother's phone calls. We see him encounter and have fun with the two hiking girls, only to leave them as abruptly and as nonchalantly as he encountered them. In flashbacks, we see a past relationship Aron shared with a beautiful blonde girl when he was younger, a relationship that ended sourly after Aron wouldn't let her in. Even when we flash back to Aron's youth, we see that his relationship with his family was one of silence. Aron lives in his own world and doesn't let anyone in, and it is this rejection of other people that got him in this situation in the first place. However, it is the change he undergoes in the canyon under the rock as he begins to realize the mistakes he has made and yearn again for the human connection he has lacked all these years that gives him the strength to do what he did. And the shots of large crowds of people that bookend the film lend further poignancy to this notion of human connection that is so beautifully depicted in this amazing and inspirational true story of perseverance and survival.",8,4,11,10 November 2010
"I Love You, Man"," A genuinely funny 'bromantic comedy': Paul Rudd is the man
","It's official: Paul Rudd is the funniest actor working in movies today. He carries with him such a unique screen presence and charisma that it's simply incomparable to any performer today. In recent years, he has become a veteran of the Apatow-style R-rated comedy films, and often manages to steal scenes from the likes of Will Farrell, Steve Carell, Seth Rogen and others. It was only recently, though, that he 'graduated' from scene-stealing supporting roles to leads, and the results are simply fantastic. Interestingly, his two latest leading roles were in films that were Apatowian in spirit but technically not produced by him, and it is in these films – Role Models and the more recent I Love You, Man, that he really shines.After introducing Paul Rudd, I want to take this opportunity to introduce another term that has come to prominence recently: 'bromance' or more accurately, the 'bromantic comedy'. This is essentially a film about two guys bonding in which the female characters support from the side and the platonic relationship between the male protagonists is central. In discussions of this sub-genre, many pundits go back and try to label classic films as 'bromances', from the 'buddy cop' films of the 80's and 90's and through to Apatow's earlier productions. I think that this discussion is quite ridiculous, because while many of these films may feature 'bromances', i.e. bonding relationships between two male characters, I Love You, Man is unique in that it is literally a 'bromantic comedy': the characters meet, have a rocky start, hit it off, enjoy each-other until they become overbearing, have their third-act slump, say that they 'think they should stop seeing each other' and, of course, end up resolving everything and making up (at a wedding, no less). It's the classic romantic comedy formula, except it depicts the platonic friendship between two male characters, and it does so wonderfully.Paul Rudd gets (and deserves) all the praise in the world for his turn in the film, but one mustn't neglect the other actors, especially his co-star Jason Seel, who was also a background performer in various Apatow films until he rose to prominence thanks to his lead role in last year's Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Paul Rudd had a brilliant supporting role in that film as well, and I think it's interesting to note the role reversal these two actors pull off this time around. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Segel played a neurotic, shy, awkward wreck of a man while Rudd played a laid-back, pot-smoking surfer dude; this time around, Rudd is the neurotic, shy awkward wreck while Segel is the laid-back, easy-going 'living life' dude. I think it's a testament to these actors' talents that they can do both, and it's perfect proof that they aren't one-note as they are often accused of being.Eventually, as it is with other recent similarly-styled films such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Knocked Up, the plot is quite irrelevant and what is important are the characters, and even more so, the comedy. And this film doesn't disappoint in that department; the banter between the characters is absolutely hilarious, their often ad-libbed gags are brilliant, and I don't think I've ever seen anyone play awkward quite as well as Rudd in this film.",7,0,0,15 October 2009
Troy," Remarkable production value but very flawed
","For a movie loosely based on a poem written thousands of years ago, the director and screenwriter have done an excellent job in re-creating the epic story and the ancient world on the screen, which was probably quite a difficult task. The production is fantastic, visual effects are great, and yet my opinion on Troy is divided in two: The movie is built in such a way that we, the viewers, aren't entirely sure who are the bad guys. Brad Pitt's Achilles is displayed as the star, the hero, and yet he fights for the Greeks, who are displayed as brutal warriors under the rule of a greedy tyrant, Agamemnon. In fact, the entire Trojan War was started only because of the greed of the king of Sparta, Menelaus. Paris, the prince of Troy (son of Priam, the king) took Helen, Menelaus' wife, back to Troy with him after a peace meeting in Sparta. This enraged Menelaus and so Agamemnon, his brother, rounded up the entire Greek army to attack Troy and retrieve his wife. On the other hand, the Trojans are sort of shown as the 'good guys'. Just because of one mistake that Paris made, the Trojans now have to hold back an attack of 50,000 Greeks, while loosing thousands of husbands, sons and cousins in the process. Hector is displayed as a family man: He doesn't want to go to war, he'd rather stay home with his wife and newborn child, but he is loyal to Troy and must fight for her. This is slightly different than the way the Trojan War had always been conveyed to me: Helen did not run off with Paris, but Paris seduced her and practically kidnapped her with him back to Troy. Hector was a big, brutal warrior who had absolutely no problem with killing as many people as he possibly could. I really liked the way the movie showed the Trojans as the good guys and the Greeks as the evil, greedy tyrants. It's definitely a fresh and original approach to the story.Production-wise the movie is stunning. The costumes, the sets, and the weapons everything is top-notch, with excellent attention to details. The visuals are also stunning. The shot of Brad Pitt standing on the deck of a ship with the camera slowly zooming out, eventually revealing the entire Greek navy consisting of 1,000 ships is really a treat to the eye. The computer graphics are excellent. It's really hard to tell in the huge battle scenes which soldiers are computer graphics and which are extras, although you know that some of them must be CG because there are so many. The long shots of the city of Troy are also great eye candy. In all, the one thing this movie is especially excellent at is entertaining, and it is definitely a visually satisfying movie.The acting is also pretty good. Brian Cox definitely stands out as the power-hungry Agamemnon. His acting is top-notch. Peter O'Toole is also good as Priam, the king of Troy. Eric Bana was great as Hector, although I don't think he physically matches the part. Brad Pitt wasn't as bad as I was worried he would be. In fact, his acting was quite good. Which brings me to my second opinion: While Brad Pitt's acting was quite good, I just don't think he fits the character of Achilles. It seems as if Brad Pitt wasn't entirely comfortable with Achilles' character, so he took it and dressed it over his own personality, which changed the character a bit. Physically, though, he looks perfect for the part. Eric Bana, on the other hand, is just the opposite. He truly captured the essence of the Hector character, and his acting is great, but I don't think that he physically matches the part. He's just kind of small and scrawny, while Hector is supposed to be taller and more muscular than Achilles, which is not how it seemed in the movie. It also seemed that his character was a bit too weak. He's supposed to be the greatest fighter on Earth, matched only by Achilles, and yet he struggled a bit just to kill Achilles' cousin, who had never even been in a battle before. When you look at how easily Achilles killed the giant soldier in the very beginning of the movie, it kind of makes Hector look far weaker than he's supposed to be. Also, while Agamemnon was supposed to be power-hungry and greedy, he was not hasty, and was considered to be one of the wisest kings. And yet, in the movie he makes very hasty and stupid decisions, which kind of lower his character to a stupid power-hungry oaf, while he was really quite smart. One character that I'm really happy about is Odysseus, played by Sean Bean. His character's essence was truly and perfectly captured: He's cunning, a good warrior and extremely smart. He constantly gives Achilles advice on how to approach Agamemnon, and is conveyed perfectly as Achilles' close friend. Odysseus also suggests various war strategies to Agamemnon, who is reluctant to listen. Now as much as I dislike Orlando Bloom, he actually pulls off the Paris character quite well, and fits the part of the weak, cowardly, naive pretty-boy prince perfectly.All in all, Troy is definitely an entertaining movie, and the production is remarkable, but a few major historical inaccuracies, strange casting choices and a particularly cliché Hollywood ending lower my appreciation for the film.",6,148,288,27 October 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Touching, honest, tragic, beautiful
","I find it hard to express in words just how this movie made me feel. Take this as less of a review and more of an expression of my impressions and feelings regarding the film.It is touching, and extremely emotional. It is raw, pure, and honest. Tragic, heart breaking. Beautiful. These are all words that describe this movie. I won't explain any of them, all I will say is, if you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about.This isn't a film for everyone. People whose favorite film from last year was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, or King Kong (as good as they may be) will probably not like Brokeback Mountain. But people who can appreciate an honest, beautiful and tragic drama, which is slow and subtle but at the same time very complex, should go see this amazing triumph of film-making.My theory is that, besides the normal division into genres, films can also be divided into the following three categories: Plot-driven films, character-driven films and mood-driven films. Plot-driven films are those in which much happens, and the plots are intricate and complex. Most American movies fall into this category. Character-driven films are more rare, and are usually win lots of awards. Recent films such as The Hours, Sideways, 21 Grams, and others are intricate character studies, although plot-wise, nothing much happens in them. Nor is the plot at all important. The third category, mood films, can be found mostly in European or Far Eastern cinema. Ang Lee, whose roots are in Hong-Kong-based cinema, brings this Eastern subtlety and ability to create a very specific and strong feeling or mood in films and transfers it to his American films.Ang Lee is a director of subtlety. Sure, he has directed some bigger films, such as Hulk, but his masterpieces (Sense and Sensibility, The Ice Storm, Eat Drink Man Woman, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) are pieces of subtlety. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has its action scenes, but the movie expresses far more in the scenes in which nobody speaks than it does in the action scenes. Even the action scenes, while impressively choreographed, still express a sort of subtle, quiet, tranquil beauty, and are not bombastic or overbearing.Almost every aspect of Brokeback Mountain is very subtle, but all these aspects together create an elaborate and very powerful mood. The cinematography is very simplistic. The camera rarely ever moves, and there are no pompous or intricate shots. The shots take there time, too, but the vistas of the Wyoming mountains and lakes are just so beautiful, and the cinematography emphasizes these vistas with stunning and unsparing long shots. The musical score, played basically on a single guitar, is minimalist, but beautiful, and fits the mood of the film perfectly. The acting, too, is subtle, but flawless and quite amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway give strong performances, but the two real stunners of the film are Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, who plays his wife. Ledger's character is so intensely complex, and yet, he acts him with such subtlety. He flawlessly slips right into the part. It's a really, really powerful performance, and it coming from Heath Ledger, whose previous movies include mediocre 'teenage' films such as 'A Knight's Tale' and '10 Things I Hate About You', only adds more to its value. Michelle Williams gives yet another strong performance, expressing her characters emotions through her facial expressions alone, and not through talking or actions. The scene in which she snaps is haunting and tragic.The script, too, is very minimalist. As in Ang Lee's previous films, the true shining moments of Brokeback Mountain are those in which none of the characters speak. There really isn't that much dialogue in the film (although this is partly because of the nature of Heath Ledger's introvert, reclusive and mainly quiet character), which allows the film to express itself through the characters' emotions and feelings, and not through their actions or dialogue.To my dismay, this film is receiving some severe backlash due to its gay themes  themes that aren't even present in the movie. The film is not a 'gay cowboy' movie  it even emphasizes the fact that both characters are heterosexuals. The movie, as its tag-line says, describes love as a 'force of nature'  it is an emotion so strong that once it grabs hold of you, it will never let you go. Although the film focuses on two very specific characters, its themes couldn't be more universal. Its message and themes could apply to any case of forbidden love  homosexual, inter-cultural, religious, and more.I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that Brokeback Mountain is a cinematic landmark. I think it is the best movie of 2005, and I will be very happy if it wins some major awards. It has already won quite a few  all of them very well deserved. I recommend this beautiful, flawless film to anyone and everyone  although viewers who are not used to slow-paced dramas probably won't benefit from the ultimate effect of this touching, emotional and tragic movie.",9,28,33,25 January 2006
500 Days of Summer," A film that stays with you; charming, funny and beautiful
","First and foremost it should be mentioned that the film is extremely well-made, despite its crew being composed mostly of first-timers. Marc Webb, the first-time director, has years of music video and commercial experience behind him, which explains how well-made and good looking the film is. But the fact that he managed to craft such a taught and fluid feature-length film is nonetheless quite impressive and almost surprising. In any case, I expect great things from him in the future. Fact is, this is an entirely indie film but without an indie feel; it's very well shot and professionally made, and I think that just adds to its genuineness. The film also features many elements that distinguish it from just an average film telling the same story: split-screen, frequent breaking of the fourth wall, a spontaneous song-and-dance number, animation, and of course the non-linear storytelling (with a number on screen indicating the position of the scene portrayed out of the titular 500 days to boot) are just a few of said elements that lend this film much of its uniqueness.But ultimately, what makes this movie as special as it is are its characters. I have always said that a film begins and ends with its characters, and as far as I'm concerned, a good, plot-less character study will always be more interesting than a great story with uninteresting characters. And in a film like this, which eventually tells a pretty simple, straightforward and mundane story that we've all seen and heard before, the characters are key to distinguish it, to make it stand out. And this film succeeds more than most others in defining and presenting real, grounded, three-dimensional and identifiable characters. First-time screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber do a fantastic job at defining these characters, but the credit lies with the actors for embodying them and breathing the life into them that radiates from the screen. I have been a long-time fan of both of the leads, especially of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who over the years, be it in Mysterious Skin or in Brick, has carved himself a niche as one of the most interesting and consistent young actors of his generation. Zooey Deschanel has always been wonderful, from her small supporting roles in older films such as Almost Famous to her more recent status as a leading lady, but this is the first movie of hers I've seen that really gives her a chance to shine and portray a fascinating and full-fledged character. Both performers really stand out in the film, and the supporting cast does a great job as well.With films like this, it is easy to appreciate the technical accomplishments, from the spot-on cinematography to the fantastic performances. But a true, emotional connection with the audience is something rare, and very personal. This film connected with me. I just felt a very strong affinity to its characters, and to the situations it put them in. What I love about movies of its type is that it portrays circumstances that are all-too-familiar, drawn from real life, and totally identifiable if one goes through similar experiences in one's own life. I think that anyone who has had experience with sour relationships or with unrequited love can identify very easily with this film and its characters. Or perhaps some people will identify with Summer; people who have found themselves in relationships, basically, in which their feelings weren't as strong as their partner's. Some moments in this film are right out of life – the moment shared by Summer and Tom outside the bar, when she's just standing there waiting for him to kiss her but he hesitates and they end up parting ways. And the film flawlessly portrays the characters' feelings as they go through these motions and find themselves in these true-to-life situations.This is an indie film, but it doesn't feel like one. It's whimsical, but never precious. It's stylized but never unrealistic. It's very small-scale but it never feels cheap. Eventually, what makes it work so well as a film is the fact that it takes a very simple story and situation, drawn from real life, and portrays it in a way that is cinematic enough to keep our interest, but realistic enough to resonate and stay true to life. It's a film that doesn't reach for the stars, doesn't feature a meaningful plot or story and doesn't convey some big message; rather, it's a film built on moments, beautiful and wonderful moments that make it so special: the narration, the song-and-dance number, Summer's glances at Tom and her reactions to his behavior, the dialogue, the two lead performances, the genuinely hilarious moments and jokes (I neglected to mention that the film is also really funny!) the music, the Belle and Sebastian and Smiths references, the non-linear chronology, the split-screen sequence showing Tom's 'expectations' on one side and the 'reality' as it actually unfolds on the other, the moments that just totally capture exactly what the real life situations they depict feel like, such as the aforementioned bar exterior, or the encounter on the train. It's one of those films that stays with you, that you want to go see again and again, to take that journey with the characters one more time, to get to know them even more, and to look into their lives and see so much of your own.",7,0,1,15 October 2009
Juno," Charming, funny, sweet, and irresistibly entertaining
","Like most films in the genre, including most recently last year's Little Miss Sunshine, the actual story of Juno is surprisingly simple. Just as Little Miss Sunshine could best be described as a 'dysfunctional family's road trip', Juno is about 'a teenage girl who gets pregnant and decides to keep the baby.' By keeping it simple and not assailing us with multiple story lines and side-tracking subplots, first-time writer Cody achieves something that many other major motion pictures fail to achieve, and that is creating a movie that is about its characters, and not about its story. And what wonderful characters they are. Cody provides us with an immensely attractive packaging, providing her characters with an ultra-quirky form of 'new-wave' speech and having them, especially Juno and her best friend, speak in a manner that I think is safe to say nobody speaks in the real world we live in. Juno is starkly characterized as a very unique individual: sarcastic, frightfully open about her feelings, cynical, tom-boyish, impulsive, and many other such characterizations that make her truly a fantastic character to behold. All the other characters are similarly exaggeratedly characterized: Michael Cera's Paulie Bleeker's unprecedented naivety and sweetly geeky devotion; Jennifer Garner's Vanessa's crazed obsession; Jason Bateman's Mark's exceptional laid-back attitude; and more. But what Cody does that is truly remarkable is providing her characters with true, realistic, real-world emotions despite their over-the-top facades. As the film progresses, for instance, we go from simply admiring Juno's unique outward manner of behavior to truly and deeply caring for her; the same goes for the other characters as well. And I absolutely love how Cody shatters the teen film cliché of overbearing parents, and provides Juno with probably the most wonderfully compassionate and understanding parents in any teen movie, for example her father, J.K. Simmons' Mac, who instead of shunning her for her mistake instead immediately offer her their help and advice. I especially love how Allison Janney completely breaks the overbearing she-demon formula of stepmother characters and provides Bren with a truly kindly character who cares only for her stepdaughter's well-being, as seen in the brilliantly wonderful scene in the ultrasound clinic when she snaps at the technician for passing judgment on her stepdaughter's pregnancy.Despite the immensely talented supporting cast, perhaps not quite reaching the bravura cast of Reitman's first feature film, Thank You For Smoking, but impressive all the same, there's no doubt in my mind that the true stunner, the brightest shining star is young Ellen Page. Her role as master manipulator in last year's Hard Candy was simply a prelude to her truly outstandingly immense talent as a multi-layered actress, which she showcases in full force as Juno MacGuff. It is a virtuoso performance to behold; Page manages to deliver Cody's undeniably complex and difficult dialogues with such pitch perfection, while still managing to retain the proper realism of a true, real-world teenage girl. Page allows all of Juno's compassion to show right through her showy, unique façade, and manages to create an incredibly fascinating film character while delivering one of the best performances of the year. And at just 20 years old, it is clear that Page has only good places to go from here, and hopefully this as her first major starring role will propel her career in the direction it deserves. I cannot wait to see what more she has to offer, because if she has this much talent at a young age, just imagine what can happen if she goes down the path of the likes of Kate Winslet or Jodie Foster, who both delivered fine performances at a young age and only got better from there.But Cody and Page are not the only ones deserving of consummate admiration for their work in creating these characters and letting the true, real emotion and drama seep through the entertaining, quirky façade. It is, after all, the director who brings everything together and Jason Reitman seems the perfect choice. He's certainly building up a name for himself, what with two undeniably fantastic works of big-cast indie comedies now under his belt. In both works he does an admirable job of not taking center stage; his two films are as much his casts' and his writers' as they are his. No showy cinematography, no in-your-face direction, no gimmicks; Reitman manages the ever-so-difficult task in independent film of letting go of control and of ego and simply letting the wonderful source material exist and be portrayed in the absolutely best way possible.It is a great and difficult task that pays off wonderfully when a film manages to emotionally and dramatically engage the viewer. It is even more admirable when a film manages to do this while at the same time be fantastically accessible; charming, funny, sweet, and irresistibly entertaining. Juno manages it all so wonderfully that it's an unprecedented pleasure of a film to watch: funny, engaging, quirky, interesting, but at the same time resonant, honest, compassionate, and truly, insightfully dramatic. Cody takes a simple real-world situation, puts it in a quirky indie-film fantasy world, but populates it with wonderfully true and sympathetic characters. Ultimately the film is about them; it's about Juno perhaps using her unusual, quirky façade to hide her true feelings; it's about Paulie's sweet, naïve devotion; it's about Vanessa's initially funny desperate obsession which we eventually understand is a beautiful desire to bring life to another person in the world; it's about Mark's wild, too-cool-to-conform attitude that eventually turns out to be an unfortunately juvenile lack of maturity; and it's about how all of these characters come together in a world of youth, impulse, beauty, love, hamburger phones and track runners.",8,2,8,30 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Great fun but the script is a travesty
","These movies are silly. It's not a criticism, just a fact. They are silly and goofy and light. They utilize juvenile humour, harebrained gags and far-fetched scenarios and ideas. And the films are completely dripping with clichés and kitsch, especially the third installment. But all these elements  which I would consider glaring flaws in any other film  are forgiven simply because I wouldn't expect anything different from this genre. The key is that the trilogy never takes itself seriously. It basically announced, right off the top from the first film, that it would be a silly, light, wacky, action-packed action-adventure-comedy. So you're actually looking for the silliness, the lame gags, the juvenile humour. This is not a movie I would expect deep character development from, or even basic movie logic. I expect to have a swashbuckling, action-packed, light, entertaining and just plain fun and enjoyable time at the cinema when I see this  nothing more, nothing less.In most fields, At World's End delivers unquestionably. It contains action scenes and set pieces that completely dwarf those in the first two installments. The final showdown is worth the admission price alone. Because of the film's nature and edifice, which may be the loosest and broadest of any film, the creative team can essentially do whatever comes to their tremendously creative minds  in all the fields. Indeed just thinking of and constructing these set pieces requires an immense sense of creativity and a complete disregard of logic or physics.In actuality, the Pirates of the Caribbean films are a dream come true for the creative fields of film-making. Production designers and costume designers essentially have total and utter freedom; because the film is set in a pseudo-fantasy period setting, they basically can design whatever wacky ideas come to mind. Indeed the production and costume design in this film is second to none, completely incomparable and totally unconventional, but looks absolutely fantastic and is wildly creative. The designs of the Singapore city and especially of the Shipwreck Cove construct  entirely made of wrecked ships all stacked and piled up into these massive towers  are astonishing and dazzling. The same can be said of the costume design, which is just fantastic and incredibly imaginative.The film is also a complete masterwork in the technical fields, especially in the special effects sphere. The filmmakers spared no expense and hired the best effects team Industrial Light & Magic had to offer  and the result is more than obvious on screen. The practical and model effects are almost as impressive as the mind-blowing, completely unbelievable CGI work, which just looks completely realistic, absolutely convincing and is integrated perfectly into the actual footage more so than any other movie of this type in recent years. Even Spider-Man 3 had some dodgy and unconvincing CGI work  Sony's mistake was insisting on creating their own effects instead of hiring an external (and more experienced and professional) company to deliver the high-expectation goods. Well, At World's End more than delivers in this department, so much so that the effects that were so mind-blowing in the second installment, Dead Man's Chest (namely the fish-pirates and Davey Jones himself) are almost taken for granted in this film. If you think about it, these creations are nothing short of astonishing, but they're just so convincing and realistic, you don't even think about it. And that is the biggest and primary sign of good CGI work.That said, the film has one glaring flaw that really hampers the entire experience: the script. This is the usual result of starting to shoot a movie without a finished script, but the story just feels and unfolds as if it were made up as they went along, instead of actually planned ahead of time  even more so than Dead Man's Chest, which also suffered from this problem. But At World's End is so confusing and awkward, it makes the plot in Dead Man's Chest seem actually quite logical and clear. The film essentially has one basic story element: the pirates of the world are facing extinction and band together for one final showdown against the armada of the East India Trading Company. The problem is that everything leading up to this showdown is so unbelievably confusing; it's surprising to learn that only two screenwriters worked on the script. I didn't even bother trying to follow after a while, but I'm sure that if I had I would notice glaringly wide plot holes, and that most of the characters' motives have absolutely no continuity whatsoever. For instance  considering the new information we discover about Tia Dalma in At World's End, one begins to wonder why, at the end of Dead Man's Chest, she volunteered to help the gang rescue Jack Sparrow in the first place? Indeed this is a major problem in the film, not only because it's absolutely impossible to follow or understand just what is going on at any given moment, but also because it is so unbelievably easy to create a story that makes sense. They managed to do so in the first film, and I think that a little more ironing on the creases in this screenplay and they could have reached something truly excellent. Because the general concept is great; it's just everything in-between that makes no sense whatsoever.Despite this, the film does have some moments where it truly shines, and one scene in particular involving a certain cameo everyone had been talking about since the first film is worth all the confusion that is the film's plot and the frustration in trying to understand it and organize it in your head. Combine these immaculate scenes with the great set pieces, action sequences and amazing technical and creative work, and one is almost ready to forgive the total travesty that is the script.

Spider-Man 3," Disappointing - overdone, underdeveloped and just plain lazy
","Everything that was good in Spider-Man 2 was completely undone in this installment, although its biggest flaws lie in its screenplay. As I had feared from the moment the first plot details were released, the film is way too cluttered. We jump from storyline to storyline, character to character; each so condensed in order to fit into the runtime that none are nearly as developed as they should have been. The biggest problem is that most of them seem entirely unnecessary. Harry's story, for instance, feels like it was included because the makers set up his villain for the third film at the end of the second and had no choice, and from there was just made up as they went along. Harry ends up dying way too many times and then unexplainably returning; his amnesia is utterly pointless since he ends up remembering everything, and couldn't Bernard have told him about his father's fate earlier and saved him all the grief? Gwen Stacy is almost entirely unused and is even less developed. I'm trying to remember if she had any important part in the film at all except for being part of various action sequences and nothing comes up. I honestly can barely see how the film would have changed had her character been removed completely, and she appears for so little time that we barely even know who her character is. The Flint Marko/Sandman character is also disappointingly underdeveloped. Instead of crafting a totally rounded, character-driven villain like Doc Ock in the second film, Raimi creates a totally flat and uninteresting villain who pretty much has just this one little banal reason as his motive for evil and has nothing else going for him. There are also various plot elements that just seem way too hackneyed and ridiculous you wonder if Raimi has learned any lessons from the failed comic book movies of the past. And when Harry joins forces with Spider-Man and the two literally hold hands and fight evil, I was reminded of how the introduction of the Robin character was clearly the straw that broke the camel that is the Batman franchise's back.In terms of drama and setting, Raimi effectively chucks into the rubbish bin everything he built so well in Spider-Man 2 in terms of characters, dynamics, drama and realism and replaces them with banal, clichéd and corny material that is so over-done it comes across as worse than a daytime soap. Pretty much every character in the film cries more than once, and for the most ridiculous reasons. I was seriously right about ready to leave the theatre, go into the bathroom, return with a box of tissues and chuck it at the screen. And after having seen Spider-Man 2, I thought that Raimi knew that drama doesn't mean you need to have everyone sobbing about everything.The film is also strangely disappointing even in the action department, and although the film is saturated with action scenes, none of them are nearly well thought out or executed well enough to have left any lasting impression at all. This is in contradiction to the action scenes in Spider-Man 2, which are some of the most memorable, well-executed and just plain fantastic in the entire genre - in particular, the train fight with Doc Ock but also others.But the film doesn't disappoint in every aspect; there are some fields in which Raimi and his crew really hith the nail on the head. I actually liked what he did with Mary Jane's character, it's just too bad that he botched up Peter Parker's character so much that the dynamics between the two don't work at all. Also, Bruce Campbell's cameo in the film is by far his best in the trilogy and possibly the funniest part of all three films. But the single best element of the entire film was the character of Eddie Brock/Venom. Topher Grace is easily the best newcomer to the cast and may be the best cast villain of all three films. He has impeccable comic timing and makes Eddie Brock immediately likable and believable. And the character of Venom is, to begin with, a fascinating villain. But once again Raimi makes a crucial mistake and reduces Venom's part to miniscule proportions  the villain is only first introduced in the final act of the film, instead of being built up beforehand.Ultimately, Spider-Man 3 has turned out to be a major disappointment. I can easily point at two primary reasons why the film failed to deliver. The first is laziness  Raimi and crew were simply too lazy to craft anything nearly as good or interesting as the previous installments, especially Spider-Man 2. The film is under whelming in nearly every aspect  character development and drama become flat, banal, clichéd and soapy; the action and visual style are uninspired and unimpressive; and the film's finale is probably the most unimaginative and uninteresting of all three films. On top of that, the second reason the film disappointed was that Raimi attempted to cram every plot line and character he possibly could into the film. This creates a jumbled, lazy mess that is really all over the place. The structure makes no sense, characters are painfully underdeveloped and don't get nearly enough screen time, and the whole thing just explodes in a shower of incoherency and detachment. Had the film focused exclusively on Venom, excluding both the Harry and especially the Sandman characters, perhaps it would have worked; that way, Raimi would have had more time to develop Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy, and we would have been able to see more of Venom, who was surprisingly absent for the majority of the film and is removed from the picture just barely after he first shows up. And the high hopes I had from Raimi and the crew after the outstanding achievement that was Spider-Man 2 make the debacle all the more disappointing.",4,13,27,5 May 2007
Zodiac," A taught thriller, fantastic story and brilliantly crafted by Fincher
","After a 5-year hiatus during which he returned to his television roots directing commercials, David Fincher is back and it looks like his past few years of experimentation with digital photography have paid off  with Zodiac, Fincher delivers what is easily his most satisfying work since Fight Club, and what is definitely one of the finest and most unique films of his career.In Zodiac, Fincher does something that he hasn't yet achieved in any of his other works: he engages himself in the story. And what a fantastic story it is. Viewing this, one has no problem seeing where Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker drew from to make Se7en. But the clear and present difference between the two films is that, as sleek, engaging and entertaining as Se7en is, it's nothing more than entertainment. We all know that in the real world a criminal investigation never lasts for such a short period of time as a week. Se7en also engages itself in your usual run-of-the-mill Hollywood storytelling techniques  young rookie detective teams up with old, edge-of-retirement detective for one last case and the whole story ends in a dramatic showdown. Quite on the contrary, Zodiac takes the far more realistic angle. One could even say that it is the quintessential crime investigation film  an epic story spanning over 3 decades and still not meeting a completely final resolution. There is no dramatic peak. The move constantly jumps weeks, months and even years forward in time. The justice system is a slow, bureaucratic process. Not everyone gets to do what he or she wants and how he or she wants to do it. And within all the facts and suspects and leads and investigations, Fincher even has time to find the root and heart of his main characters. He chooses wisely not to indulge in any exposition for the characters  we learn about them, about their lives, their mannerisms and their clockwork as the movie progresses.The acting is absolutely superb all around. Jake Gyllenhaal, who has already sealed his place as one of the most promising young actors with Brokeback Mountain and Jarhead, delivers a restrained and un-showy performance. The same goes for Mark Ruffalo, Chloe Sevigny and many of the other principal cast members. They all achieve what is most difficult for an actor to achieve: they disappear into their characters, just as Fincher disappears into the film's plot and story. The one real standout, as usual, is Robert Downey, Jr. His role in this film is added to a series of recent film roles of his that just further and further fuel my adoration towards him. He is quick, witty, hilarious and irresistible to watch, while also managing to take these characteristics so easily identifiable with him and applying them to his character. It's no wonder he's one of my favourite actors.In terms of style, although Fincher directs this with restraint that's not to say that the film completely lacks it. Fincher and cinematographer Harris Savides utilize natural but highly stylized lighting. Fincher's camera still manages to capture beautiful shots, and the use of digital video allows the night sequences to show up better and crisper than they possibly could on film, considering the use of natural lighting and deep focus Fincher employs. But the real achievement in the film is Fincher's restraint; his ability to give the film a stylish and sleek look without ever letting the cinematography to become so showy that it just completely takes over.In all the film has very high production value on all the technical planes. Fincher utilizes the very best set and costume design work to accurately recreate the time periods, and his perfectionist nature makes sure to see to every last detail. A soundtrack of pop songs is also utilized fantastically to recreate the periods, and in all Fincher's relentless attention to detail pays off well. Of course his direction is greater than ever and perhaps more dominant here than in any of his films  the recreations of the Zodiac murders are ominous and chilling to the bone while Fincher avoids using any cheap tricks.I have thought about it extensively and I just can't see why this film performed so poorly at the box office. Perhaps it was the bad choice of a release date  in a time slot usually reserved for the studios' shameful failures and holdovers from the previous year's Oscar hopefuls, perhaps the movie going audience wasn't ready for an unprecedented movie such as this one. Taking notes directly from Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men, Fincher manages to create with Zodiac a long and epic film based extensively on exposition, dialogue and phone conversations, featuring a murder case so puzzling it still leaves you asking questions and trying to follow leads after the movie is over, that despite all that remains relentlessly entertaining. A taught thriller, a fantastic story and script and brilliant execution from Fincher, this is the best work he has brought us in a long time, and so far probably the best movie of the first half of the year",10,0,0,3 August 2007
The Prestige," Twists and turns don't always work, but still a fascinating study of obsession
","On surface level, the film is a gorgeous treat. It is beautifully designed and crafted, with lush and never too eye-popping cinematography while still remaining quietly beautiful. All the set and costume design perfectly emulates the Victorian time period without ever seeming like it's trying to hard. On the contrary  as a historic presentation, it is a very fascinating portrayal of a form of entertainment that reached indescribable peaks of popularity during this particular time period. From a technical standpoint, the film is a sleek and stylish success.It also uses an interesting storytelling technique of a mixed-up chronology in order to further add to the initial confusion, although everything comes together in the end. It's not quite on par with the mixed chronology of 21 Grams, but it's an interesting sort of 'return to form' for director Christopher Nolan after Memento.The acting is also fantastic from everyone involved, although nobody stands out in particular. Bale and Jackman lead the pack and both provide excellent turns, while the supporting players Caine, Johansson, Bowie and even Andy Serkis' small but memorably supporting role all provide satisfying performances with much expertise.But it is when we get to the story itself that the film somewhat trips over itself. Fact of the matter is, the twist (or rather, twists) at the end of the film were, at least as I found, painfully predictable. Let's not mention the Angier twist which became apparent the moment the surprise success of Tesla's machine is revealed: But even the Borden twist, which was slightly more surprising if you ask me, was easily foreseen  the way Nolan presented the character of Borden's mentor/secret keeper came across as extremely suspicious from frame one, and it soon became apparent that the solution to Borden's trick lay within this character. On the other hand, one element of the story that could have gone wrong but instead throws the movie in its most interesting direction is the somewhat science fiction/fantasy element of Tesla's machine  more on this later. I found the end in which everything is revealed to be more under whelming than what Nolan may have been aiming for, but luckily, Nolan doesn't fail to deliver.Had the film been left in the hands of another filmmaker, the twists at the end may have been portrayed as the point of the film. And the repetition of Cutter's opening lines may throw the audience off guard and in the direction of the twist being of the most importance. But it is not so. The true meaning of the film lies in the line 'No one cares about the man in the box.' Allow me to explain.While slightly failing in the storytelling department, as a tale of morality and the human spirit, the film is incredibly successful and amazingly poignant. It seems that Nolan's auteur as a director is beginning to take form, as very specific themes can be found in all of his features. First and foremost, all of his features deal with the human mind one way or another. Memento and Insomnia both portray a mental condition. Batman Begins certainly portrays how Bruce Wayne was scarred for life by a traumatic event (the death of his parents) that drives all of his actions in the film. And now The Prestige also portrays a similar scarring, of how a traumatic event can lead to dangerous obsession. Which brings me to a further and more specific theme Nolan has in all of his features: Obsession. In Memento, Leonard is so obsessed with finding his wife's killer, he simply refuses to accept that he has already been found, since obsession is all that drives him through life. In Insomnia, Dormer's character forms a very unhealthy obsession with the murder involving Walter. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne's obsession with revenge against his parents' death drives him to extreme measures. And now in The Prestige, we find Angier, who is clearly obsessed with proving his worth against Borden, throwing all moral boundaries out in order to achieve his goal. Imagine the moral implementations of killing yourself again and again and again but always coming back. It's mind-blowing just to think of how obsessed you must be to do such a thing to yourself.Ultimately, while the twists of the film don't necessarily work, it is a lavish and beautifully produced product while managing to both entertain and portray a haunting depiction of human morality, obsession and the human mind's shocking ways of dealing with such things. In this sense, the film is an utter success, and a harrowingly difficult one to process at that.",9,2,3,25 January 2007
Once," What bitter sweetness this film stirs
","What bitter sweetness this film stirs within the deepest bowels of any viewer! And how startling it is that such a small, miniscule piece of work that stirs such emotions, that big, bloated epics many times fail to stir? Production value is low but the almost documentary-style film-making only adds to the realism. The movie was shot mostly on video and with many extended, uncut long takes quite unlike the complex, operatic set-ups we've seen in the films of Martin Scorsese and more recently in Alfonso Cuaron's Children of Men, but rather simple, static shots simple depicting our two characters interacting. Most of the film is just that  the two characters interacting  but such incredible depth of emotion derives from these interactions that it is truly inspirational. The filmmakers' and actors' capturing of total and utter realism is so convincing, that the film might as well be a documentary feature about two music lovers, following them from their chance encounter and throughout the course of a whirlwind, impulsive week of music-making. But what's truly remarkable is the emotional rainbow this documentation provides.The key word in this film is simplicity. The plot is as simple as it gets  a chance meeting and a week of music making. Production value is almost non-existent and the cinematography is obviously simplistic and minimalist  except for one set-up involving a crane, which seemed a little out of place for my taste. The acting is extremely minimalist and realistic; we sort of get the feeling that our two stars are very much like the characters they play in real life, much like the same feelings evoked from Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise/Before Sunset, in which we know Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy donate so much of themselves into their characters.Many people have labeled this film as a modern-day musical. Well, at first I resented this statement, as all of the music in the movie is performed on-screen within the context of the film. We don't see any breaking out into song-and-dance in this film; it is all the real, actual music these two people are making on-screen and in real time. But later on I thought about it a bit, and eventually reached a conclusion that may explain why people describe the movie so. In the classic movie musicals, the songs all deal with advancing and portraying the plot. In Once, though, there is a twist: Since there isn't actually much of a plot to talk about (although the characters DO have a well-rounded arc), the songs all deal with advancing and portraying the characters' emotional states. Listen to the broken-ness of Hansard's earlier songs written about his girlfriend in London. Or to the sad longing of the lyrics Irglová writes to Hansard's as-yet-unwritten melody that he leaves her on a CD player.If the songs pack a big emotional punch, the rest of the movie packs a much more subtle emotional resonance. I think this may just be one of the saddest, truest and most beautiful cinematic depictions of platonic and entirely unrequited love. Many people have said that they left this film with feelings of elation and levity. I myself found the ending extremely melancholy. It's great that both of our characters at least try to get back together with there long lost loves, but it is sad that they don't get to see each-other for one last time. It is sad to think that even if the Guy goes back to London, he may not be able to mend the wounds with his girlfriend. It is sad to think that if the Girl couldn't get along with her husband the first time, chances are that the same troubles will arise the second time around. It is sad to think that if Hansard isn't himself a stadium-filling musician in real life, his character in the movie probably also won't be one. And it is great, of course, that the film ends where it does, in their parting, and doesn't linger on what happens after the Guy arrives in London and submits his demo tape, for example. The film begins and ends in the relationship between the two people and leaves it at that. But how sad it is that when the Guy asks the girl if she loves her husband, she replies in Czech so that he won't understand 'no, I love you.' And it is saddest to think that all the beautiful, happy and good things that happen in the film can happen only once in a lifetime. As the film's tagline says: How often do you find the right person? The answer lies in the film's title: Once. Many other questions can be asked: How often do you get a chance to go from being a Dublin busker to recording a professional demo tape? How often do you get a loan from a bank teller that just happens to have a passion for what you're trying to get a loan for? How often do you get to secretly rip off your father's beloved motorcycle for the day? The answer to all the questions: Once.Shot on a shoestring budget, it's films like these that promise a very promising future indeed for independent foreign film. Devoid of the weights carried by Hollywood productions and the need to contradict those weights fulfilled by American independent film, the independent cinema of the world is free to draw inspiration from whatever source it requires, be it the human psyche, random surrealism or Irish folk music. Once in particular succeeds so admirably in all its fields not only because of the stunningly beautiful music it features, but also because of the simplicity and the anonymity of its characters and events. Can this happen to anyone? Yes. How many times can it happen? Once.",8,12,13,3 November 2007
Knocked Up," The funniest comedy troupe working in film deliver another winner
","Judd Apatow and friends consistently prove that they are the funniest comedy troupe working today. Forget Ben Stiller, forget Adam Sandler. Please forget Dane Cook, and a seemingly endless troupe of un-funny comedians trying to make their way on the big screen. There have only ever been so few personalities that are just naturally and automatically funny. Charlie Chaplin. Buster Keaton. The Marx Brothers. Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. Woody Allen. Seth Rogen. Paul Rudd.What was so impressive about The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not only the entire cast's unique ability to be naturally funny no matter what they do, but also it's heart and sincerity. While taking a sort of high-concept, gimmicky idea in order to set up the situation comedy, 40-Year-Old Virgin does succeed admirably in featuring honest, convincing and just totally real characters that you always believe in. With Knocked Up, Apatow and crew go even one step further by creating a movie so unbelievably rooted in reality, it may has well just have been a documentary about a bunch of naturally funny people and how they deal with a simple, small-scale domestic occurrence: A one night stand-turned-pregnancy.The film is surprisingly poignant and intelligent, featuring a fantastically real-world story of learning to grow up and accept responsibility. 'Life doesn't care about your own life plans,' the movie says, and within this lies the crux of just why Knocked Up is as sweet and poignant as it is. Rogen's Ben, while essentially being a personification of Rogen himself, does learn valuable life lessons and it is simply fantastic to see with what skill Apatow integrates this fictional character arc onto a non-fictional character (in a way).That said, it is also, of course, total comic brilliance. Seth Rogen has really made a name for himself for one of the most naturally funniest performers working today - nothing he does ever feels forced, and judging by his character Ben's characteristics and history, one can easily see that Rogen is pretty much just playing himself in the movie. And he's got great taste too - t-shirts and movie discussions aside, the man has an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind poster hanging in the baby room. Brilliant! Paul Rudd also proves once again that he is comic genius.In all, Knocked Up, along with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, just prove that there are some people in the word that are almost unfairly naturally funny. You see a 'comedy' like Dude Where's My Car?, and you can just crystal-clearly see the massive difference between the forced, un-funny, cheap-shot comedy in the latter film as opposed to the real, intelligent and natural comedy of Apatow's ventures. I hope to see much more from these performers and filmmakers in the future. Because while Apatow's productions are funny enough (Anchorman, Talladega Nights, etc), it is his in his directorial ventures where he truly showcases an unprecedented knack of naturalistic, intelligent comedy. And it works fantastically well.",7,0,2,1 September 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A perfect marriage of cinematic creative team and source material
","The film is one of the greatest recent examples of a perfect marriage of cinematic creative team and source material. It is only fitting that Stephen Sondheim's dark, macabre, horrific musical be adapted to the screen by none other than Tim Burton, who if anything excels at the dark and the macabre. Although Burton's greatest cinematic preamble to Sweeney Todd is his equally dark and nearly equally gory Sleepy Hollow, incidentally also starring Johnny Depp, with its de-saturated colour palette and gloomy, shadowy, other-worldly atmosphere; the fact is that most of Burton's work belongs to a more childish, fantastical type of macabre. Most of his movies are rated PG, and although claiming to be a stranger to the genre, it's important to notice that some of these films also contain musical numbers. Although not directed by him, The Nightmare Before Christmas was a full-fledged musical, and the same goes for the similarly stop-animated Corpse Bride, this time directed by Burton himself. Even his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory contained a few musical numbers in the form of the Oompa Loompa songs, but one can truly look at Sweeney Todd as a confluence of many of Burton's previous themes and subjects, coming out in full force with guns blazing.At the center of the film is Stephen Sondheim's musical work, which is so intensely complex and fantastically intricate it's even more of a wonder that it all works so well. Indeed, considering the immense complexity along with the dark, serious nature of the story and the ultimate tragedy of the tale, one can liken Sondheim's work far less to the classic Broadway musical revue and more to a full-fledged modern opera. With songs featuring multiple characters singing and overlapping one another only to occasionally synchronize to incredibly complicated note transitions, recurring themes, lines and elements throughout the entire work, recurring and winding sets of rhymes and rhythms, it is indeed an epic, complicated, majestically elaborate work that deserves credit on its own. And while Sondheim's full, 3-hour musical is more than worth a viewing (or at least a listen) in order to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the entire work, Burton's film adaptation adequately and delicately condenses the musical to make it work more as a film and less as a stage show and retains the complexity and beauty of the original musical work.But this is also a Tim Burton film, and that also carries a series of characteristics and complexities unique to the director. Burton is indeed a wonder, a perfect example of a modern-day director who didn't break onto the scene through independent film but rather through the traditional studio system with which he has always managed to work with and prosper in. Burton's signature dark, macabre style comes in full force in the film in which sunlight is rarely glimpsed and the scenes are almost always drenched in a gray, de-saturated, colour-less palette  except when doused with the occasional blood splatter. Also in step with his previous works, the film retains an unreal, fantastical, otherworldly feeling to it. It is a highly stylized, darker, fantastical twist on our real-world reality, as much of Burton's films are. Frequent Burton collaborator and costume designer Colleen Atwood, along with extremely talented production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski do their utmost best to evoke the dark, macabre atmosphere the film revels in. The fantasy genre is almost cheating when it comes to costume and production design, because quite literally everything goes, but I'm sure those who work in the field get the most pleasure out of projects like Sweeney Todd in which their creative minds can truly go wild and create wondrous works evoking fantastical emotions. What's for sure is that like Wes Anderson, Tim Burton's films are unmistakable and instantly recognizable based on his unique visual style alone.It is a wondrous and fulfilling experience to have your expectations met, and even exceeded. Everything was going for this film and it certainly didn't disappoint. A more than fitting addition to the Tim Burton canon, it is, on its own, a beautiful and exciting film; dramatically rewarding with its overtures of false imprisonment, evil, revenge and tragedy; its amazingly complex, operatic musical score and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim; top-notch performances from Burton's major players and a superb visual style and production value. Fans of the musical genre will rejoice to see such serious, dark, menacing subject matter getting the revue treatment  though the film knows just when to pepper itself with sly, appropriately black humour  and while those who dislike the genre may find the film's almost entirely-sung dialogue difficult to ignore, they may still find more than enough to enjoy in what is one of the most satisfying events of the year.",7,1,2,14 February 2008
Shutter Island," Much more than just an atmospheric psychological thriller
","Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors to have ever emerged in the history of film, and it is a joyous miracle that such a legend is still working today. Not only that, but these last few years Scorsese has really reached the peak of his career: he finally won an Oscar and his last few movies have been the most financially successful of his entire career. As a direct result of his legendary status and lengthy career, Scorsese has definitely earned the right to make whatever movies he wants to – If he shot excrement for an hour-and-a-half I would probably watch it. Luckily for us, though, his advanced years and many films, some of which are masterpieces of modern cinema, have not hampered or decreased the quality of his film-making in any way – in fact, his last few films were made with uncharacteristic energy and vitality for a director nearing his 70th birthday. His latest film, Shutter Island – his first narrative feature since his Oscar win for The Departed four years ago – is perhaps a bit of a departure from his usual fare and style. But it is still undeniably a Scorsese picture, as it transcends its genre and features many of the characteristics that identify his previous films. It's just a little harder to find them this time.Before delving into the more debatable aspects of the film, I first want to mention its undeniably successful aspects, which are mainly cosmetic but are most prominent indeed. Scorsese's visual language has always been highly stylized, but this movie puts even Goodfellas and The Aviator to the test, and serves to be one of Scorsese's most hyper-stylized films yet. And with the aid of one of the greatest and most unique cinematographers working today, Robert Richardson, it also becomes what is ultimately probably Scorsese's best-looking film. Richardson's trademark style of direct-from-above spot-lighting, diffusion lenses and overexposure work overtime on this film as we drift between reality and dreams with a wink of an eye. But it's not just the cinematography that's at work here: we are treated to fedoras and trench-coats, characters puffing on cigarettes every chance they get, dripping sewers, rusty iron gates, flickering lights, creaking wood: This is Scorsese's ode to the old film-noir mystery thrillers from the 40's and 50's that he probably meticulously studied and analyzed at film school and that no doubt influenced his film-making from the beginning. Accompanied by an impressive collection of creepy and ominous musical selections, the whole thing plays out like a grand old-fashioned, highly stylized detective movie. But that's too simple for Scorsese, and the film quickly reveals itself to be far more than just that.Another greatly impressionable element of the film is its acting, specifically the lead performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Leo was always talented – there's no need to look any further than one of his earliest film roles in What's Eating Gilbert Grape for a testament to his abilities – but he has truly blossomed as an actor under Martin Scorsese's wing. His performance in Gangs of New York was a little uneven, but no less than two years after that film came out he delivered the finest performance of his career, in The Aviator. This is his fourth collaboration with Scorsese and in it he delivers one of the finest performances of his career: it is a ferocious, bombastic and intense performance that despite its grandiose is still filled with subtlety and finesse: DiCaprio has a complex character to play and he nails every gesture and every motion. Like his other recent films, Shutter Island is blessed with an incredible ensemble cast filled to the brim with famous names as well as lesser-known but immensely talented character actors who really bring an extra quality when Scorsese lets them go all-out. In terms of the major supporting performances, both Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley do a fantastic job at playing simple but crucial characters whom we learn know more than we may have thought, and who keep that knowledge subtly under wraps all throughout. There are also a number of character actors who only have one appearance but who really stand out and totally steal their individual scenes, including Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson and Elias Koteas.At first glance, Shutter Island seems like an excuse for Scorsese to demonstrate that he is also capable of delivering highly stylized genre cinema: A good, old-fashioned, moody, atmospheric psychological thriller in which the fedora-and-trench coat-wearing detective finds himself caught up in a massive conspiracy. But fairly early on, when the World War II flashbacks begin to kick in, we already start to feel that there is something more at work. At first I was a little turned off by the film's finale, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it served a greater purpose. Scorsese is too good to have his film revolve around a 'twist' ending: rather, it becomes a direct continuation of and sheds important light on the nature of the main character. So ultimately, what starts out as a particularly thrilling and stylish piece of genre fiction, eventually reveals itself to be a fascinating and resonant character study. I knew I could count on Scorsese to deliver something more profound than just another exercise in style. And while not quite on the level of his most powerful films, it's still good, and definitely better than any other director could have done with the source material.",8,1,4,27 February 2010
Ocean's Thirteen," A solid entertainment that doesn't quite reach the heights of the first
","This is a good entertainment. The first film in the trilogy was a great entertainment. When Ocean's Eleven came along, I remember myself being totally surprised  I had no idea there could be so much 'cool' in one movie. The all-star cast, which we almost take for granted by this third installment, was unprecedented when it came out. And Soderbergh, who had a solid, fluid, complex script to start with, took all the pieces and mixed them all together to create a fantastically smooth, slick, fast-paced, funny and just plain enjoyable entertainment.But with Ocean's Twelve the gang sort of stumbled. The film suffered from two major flaws. The first was that it gave off the impression of a 'guy's night out' and not an actual structured movie, with a solid plot or characters. And deriving from this, it just seemed like nobody really cared about what was actually going on. Soderbergh went completely wild with his experimental film style; meanwhile the scriptwriters sloppily glued a plot together that started out from Benedict trying to get revenge on the Eleven and eventually became some sort of competition between thieves that required a lot of suspension of disbelief. Couple that with the actors basically just having their ball throughout and the movie basically being one big private joke, and you had a serious problem unless you were George, Matt, Brad, Steven or any of the other guys involved. The entire movie emulated this sort of feeling that the people on the screen knew something that we, the audience, didn't.Luckily, everyone got their act together for the third installment, starting from the scriptwriters. The gang invited a new screen writing team on board replacing the original writers, and in turn the script returned to a more 'back to basics' style. This time around no time was wasted and no unnecessary plot threads left astray like the all-over-the-place Ocean's Twelve. Once again, the film returned to the simple, straightforward style of the first: A gang of well-characterized thieves takes revenge on an evil Las Vegas megalomaniac by robbing his casino. The motive that sets things in motion this time around are a little more otherworldly than in the first film, in which Danny Ocean, unbeknownst to his criminal colleagues, set up the Benedict job in order to get back his wife Tess. In Thirteen the motive doesn't work all that well, but it doesn't matter because most of the film, like in the first one, chronicles the set-up and eventually the execution of the job, and it's just a blast to watch. In addition, I must take my hat off to the writers for actually being able to conceive such an amazingly and unbelievably elaborate heist as is featured in this film. It is unfathomably complex and yet, as it all unfolds in the third act, every little thing falls exactly into place. It's simply a thrill to watch.The whole cast is back with the notable omission of a strong female actress. I mean, with all due respect to Ellen Barkin, she isn't exactly Julia Roberts, and in his quest to assemble the most shining all-star cast possible, Soderbergh had a winner with Roberts on board. That said, Al Pacino is quite the addition to the cast. Although we're all more than familiar with his shtick, it was absolutely wonderful to see him in this piece. I rather understandably skipped his last few forays (Two for the Money, 88 Minutes) so essentially the last time I saw him on in a film was in The Merchant of Venice back in 2004. I do hope Pacino does choose to take more higher quality projects such as this one, because it's really sad to see his career in the dump  and worse, he himself admits that the worse the script the bigger the paycheck. The rest of the cast, obviously, do a fantastic job, but the real treat is to see each cast member in his own moment acting opposite the legendary Pacino.In an attempt to create the most unbelievably luxurious hotel man could possibly imagine, production designer Philip Messina went above and beyond to create a treasure cove of amazingly gorgeous sets that are the interior of the Bank hotel. And of course, Soderbergh, who also serves as the film's cinematographer under the code name Peter Andrews, delivers some interesting material, especially in terms of lighting and colouration but also some totally wild composition and an unprecedented use of the zoom lens.In all, Ocean's Thirteen is a fantastic, light-hearted, fast-paced, fun and funny entertainment that contains a taut, focused screenplay that is elaborate and complex while never crossing over the line into confusing. And although it doesn't completely recreate the fresh-faced magic of the first film in the trilogy, Ocean's Eleven, it certainly emulates a similar sensation. It is safe to say that Ocean's Thirteen is the best and most satisfying of this summer's entire onslaught of threequels. Just one thing left me scratching my head: with the omission of Tess, I just don't understand who is the 13th member of the team as appears in the title?",7,2,5,9 June 2007
Corpse Bride," An inspired, beautiful tale of melancholy romance
","Acclaimed director Tim Burton's latest venture into the world of stop-motion animation, a world with which he has long been acquainted with, is an inspired, beautiful tale of melancholy romance. Don't let the creepy title of this macabre musical throw you off. Granted, this kind of film may not be for all tastes, but if you can get past the ghoulish appearance of the film and are game for a wondrous, haunting world of fantasy and love, then this is the movie for you.Although deriving from a relatively simple screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler and Caroline Thompson, Corpse Bride showcases characters that are well etched and constructed, and that are able to form a very strong, emotional bond with the audience. We truly feel for Emily, the Corpse Bride, whose heart was broken once before and is threatened to be broken again, by Victor, who wants to leave the World of the Dead and return to his love, Victoria. We sympathize with Victoria who, while waiting for her true love Victor to return, is being forced to wed another man by her desperate parents. And we feel for Victor, of course, for having to face this awful dilemma and choose one of the two brides. While I won't give away the conclusion, I will mention that the film's finale is one of the most beautiful scenes I've seen in an animated film. The final shot is a wondrous, memorable end, reminiscent of the melancholy ends of some of Disney's greatest films.The animation is, of course, top notch. It is virtually seamless, fluent and full of motion and energy. The characters and figures move as in real life. The animators have clearly put a lot of effort into even the tiniest of details, such as the billowing of the Corpse Bride's dress, or the way her and Victor's hair move when they walk or swing their heads. The characters themselves are beautifully designed, every character having distinct traits that truly define it. Much detail has gone even into the tiniest background character. It is certainly a giant leap from the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials of the 1960s, or Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion monsters, which influenced Burton to begin work with stop-motion animation in the first place. It is even a technical leap from The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton's previous feature-length stop-motion masterpiece, from 1993. What's for sure, Corpse Bride is a beautiful rebuke to the current trend of 3D computer animation, started by Pixar in 1995 with Toy Story.The voice work is also excellent. Johnny Depp (Victor) tones down his usual eccentric acting and delivers a simple, quiet, innocent performance in a perfect British accent. Helena Bonham Carter (The Corpse Bride), Burton's fiancé for four years now, also delivers a wonderful performance, and proves her singing talents as she sings her heart out in one of the musical numbers. The other cast members, including Emily Watson (Victoria), Albert Finney (Finnis Everglot, Victoria's father), Tracey Ullman (Nell Van Dort, Victor's mother) and Christopher Lee (Pastor Galswells) to name a few, are quite effective at bringing their characters to life.As with The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton and his art and set design team paint two distinctly different worlds in the film, both an amazing visual achievement and absolutely gorgeously designed. In The Nightmare Before Christmas, these two worlds are Halloween Town and Christmas Town. In Corpse Bride they are the World of the Living and the World of the Dead. Ironically, it is the World of the Dead that is colorful and lively, while the World of the Living is painted in austere, lifeless mutes of gray. With the World of the Living, Burton paints a Victorian Nightmare, a pale, lifeless, Gothic wonderland with muted colors bordering on gray-scale and large, somber, cold yet beautifully dark set pieces. Such design is by now considered a trademark of Burton, and is expected of him after appearing in his previous films such as Edward Scissorhands, the two Batman films, and Sleepy Hollow. The other world, the World of the Dead, is livelier, the sets full of color and crammed with detail and character. In the World of the Dead, the design team create a colorful world of decaying flesh, decomposition, and a wonderful, merry good time of singing and dancing. The decaying yet colorful characters, figures and streets are absolutely brilliantly designed.The music is yet another element of this film to praise. Danny Elfman, longtime collaborator of Tim Burton's (he scored all of Burton's films from his first and up until this one, except for Ed Wood), continues his trend of writing and performing songs for Burton's movies (he has previously done so for The Nightmare Before Christmas and, recently, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). His nifty little songs are really quite enjoyable, the highlight of them being a song titled 'Remains of the Day', a pure, jazzy number Elfman clearly enjoyed composing  he even sang the song himself. As expected, the musical score of the film, aside from the songs, is powerfully atmospheric and reaches peaks of true composing brilliance at times. To sum it all up, Corpse Bride is whimsical but eerie, funny but melancholy. If The Nightmare Before Christmas was a Christmas-tainted pop number, Corpse Bride is a waltz  an elegant, romantic, melancholy tale, an ode to love and sacrifice. This film doesn't only have everything I look for in an animated film, but also everything that I look for from a Tim Burton film. I'm convinced that, with time, this film will become a classic like The Nightmare Before Christmas. It's an instant classic in my book, a surefire contender for being crowned the Best Animated film of the year, and a film like nothing else at the movies these days.",8,2,4,27 October 2005
Gone Baby Gone," Powerful performances; succeeds in capturing the Boston atmosphere and a powerful morality tale
","Another in this year's continuous selection of morality tales, Gone Baby Gone raises a lot of questions; deep, resonant moral questions of course, but also some external questions that haven't to do with the film content but rather the talent behind the camera, questions also raised back in 1998. Questions like 'how is this guy, who has an unusual tendency to pick bad movie roles and the wrong people to date, so good at film-making?', and 'why hasn't he done this stuff before?', and 'why hasn't he done any more of this?' Indeed Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's debut-and-only screenplay, Good Will Hunting, is one of the greatest examples of debut screen writing and is intriguing not only because it is so good as a stand-alone work, but also intriguing because the two haven't written a screenplay since. That is until now, when Affleck wrote and also chose to direct his second (mainstream) screenplay, and did such a fantastic job that it's incredibly that he didn't use his Hollywood clout to land a directing job before this one.Affleck utilizes his intimate knowledge and personal experience of the streets of Boston and employs this experience to create one of the best portrayals of rural city atmosphere in recent years. Affleck paints the seedy underbelly of Boston with immense skill, clearly making use of the sights, sounds, backgrounds and people he grew up with and even putting many of them in the film. Indeed one of the greatest elements working to the film's advantage is Affleck's spot-on brilliant ability to capture the very spirit and atmosphere of the underbelly of Boston, an ability that should leave many directors envious.Another element working to the film's advantage is the acting. Affleck directs his extremely talented actors to absolutely pitch-perfect performances, and manages to turn his younger brother into a bona-fide leading man. This role, along with his supporting turn in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, are sure to propel his star in Hollywood immensely. Affleck simply commands the film and proves that he is more than capable of carrying not only a complex, intricate mystery plot but also a very heavy moral dilemma and message. Michelle Monaghan is passable but doesn't really have much acting to do, but the rest of the cast deliver stellar performances, in particular Ed Harris as the hard-boiled detective who helps Affleck's Patrick character, and even more so in Broadway veteran Amy Ryan who delivers a frightening, visceral, raw and brilliantly vicious performance as the broken, manic drug-addicted mother whose young daughter's abduction puts the plot's gears in motion. It is a fantastic star-making performance for her as well and this will hopefully be the launching point for a wonderful film career for her as well as for Casey Affleck.As I previously mentioned, Gone Baby Gone serves as one of many morality-themed films released in 2007, which study and sometimes judge the motives that cause people to do the things they do and make the decisions they choose to make. In the film, based on the novel by Dennis Lehane who is no stranger to dark, Boston-set morality tales, the main character Patrick must choose between understanding the motives behind a heinous crime and perhaps even reaching the conclusion that they were good-natured motives, and between making the decision he thinks is right but may not be. Any film which openly raises these questions and actively engages its audience in the moral dilemma, in effect asking the viewers what they think is right, automatically gets some high points in my book, especially if it is done as effectively as in this film.That said, the movie suffers from one major drawback in that in the final act it allows the shocking mystery revelations to take over in place of the heavy moral dilemmas and the brilliantly detailed depiction of the Boston underbelly that characterize the first two thirds of the film and make them so brilliant. These revelations aren't all on the brightest side and the whole conspiracy theory is old and rather daft, but the film skims over these parts rather quickly and hastily returns to its previous high levels of quality, characterized by powerfully brilliant and spot-on performances and wonderful, location-based direction from Ben Affleck. As a debut directorial effort the film is even more impressive, and even without Affleck's name on the poster it still works as an effective, engaging morally themed crime-mystery.",7,1,4,24 December 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," The best action-thriller franchise since the 60's and 70's
","It is fairly simple to put a finger on just what makes this movie in particular and the Bourne trilogy as a whole such superior action films. Just compare The Bourne Ultimatum to another summer action-vigilante extravaganza, Live Free or Die Hard. While the filmmakers clearly had a blast making the latter film, it must be taken with a grain of salt and requires quite a lot of suspension of disbelief. And indeed, most of the stunts, action scenes, concepts and characters in that film are so incredibly unbelievable they are borderline parody. But the Bourne movies have this relentless knack of keeping it real  real-world settings, great attention to detail and protocol, on-set action and car chases, and just an overall realistic and totally believable feel to them. Indeed, it is this ultra-realistic, totally believable aspect and tone that makes me appreciate the Bourne series far more than other spy franchises such as Mission: Impossible, Jack Ryan, and, dare I say it  James Bond.But that's not all that makes the Bourne films unique and sets them apart from most of the other movies in its genre. In most action-adventure films, the sides are very clear and present: The main character is the hero and operates solely for the side of good, while the villains are also clearly outlined. But in the Bourne films, these relations are far less black-and-white. Jason Bourne himself is clearly the protagonist, but obviously doesn't operate for the 'greater good'. He's on a personal crusade, seeking revenge and information, and on the way, breaks all sorts of laws and rules and kills whoever stands in his path. On the other hand, all the various CIA operatives working to catch him, it could be said, are just doing their job. We don't have any super villain masterminds; we just have a bunch of men and women doing their job trying to catch someone who clearly is dangerous and a threat. It is these ambivalent and conflicting motives of the films' characters that make them such a treat to watch.Specifically on Ultimatum, Paul Greengrass and all the technical crew do a stellar job of creating the Bourne world and relaying the realism and believability of the story. Greengrass again utilizes his hyper-realistic documentary style of film-making that featured in all his previous films, most recently United 93. It's disorienting and confusing, but the style serves the film's purposes perfectly. It is also absolutely wonderful to see an action-thriller movie that prominently features on-set, practical stunts and effects, as opposed to using lots of CGI to tweak up the action and to make things easier. And what action sequences this film has! From the first scene Bourne grabs you, and we the audience literally run through the movie right along with him. It's just fascinating to see how Bourne's mind works; how he thinks on the spot, always sees the broader picture, and of course does his fair share of close hand-to-hand combat  those scenes in particular are breathtakingly well choreographed. It is also worth mentioning the insane chase sequences, both on foot and in vehicle, and I'm particularly glad that the film's advertising didn't give too much away of the film's grand finale car chase, which is one of the most thrilling and outstanding action sequences I've seen lately.One can't review this film without mentioning the cast. In all of its installments the Bourne series was blessed with some fantastic supporting character talent  in the first film we had Chris Cooper and Brian Cox both deliver outstanding work. The Bourne Supremacy added the unexpected but more-than-welcome casting of Joan Allen, one of the most underrated actresses working today. And in this film, we are introduced to characters played by David Strathairn and Albert Finney, with Strathairn in particular delivering absolutely stellar work. But the true star and the one who ties it all together is, of course, Matt Damon. Damon is an actor I have grown to appreciate more and more in recent years, and especially in light of last year's release of The Departed, I am very surprised that Damon only has one acting Oscar nomination. His work on the Bourne films is far subtler as his character does a lot more running and fighting than he does talking. But Damon succeeds in doing what most A-list actors fail to do: He disappears into the character. During most of the film, I forgot that I was watching Matt Damon because I was so engrossed in the action and into his character. This level of disappearance is one that actors such as Tom Cruise are simply unable to do. And for that, I commemorate Damon all the more. Julia Stiles, on the other hand, doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but one would think that a more established or talented actress would be able to do much more with the character than she does. Still, she's not a burden nor a distraction like Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, so her casting is more than forgivable.Director Greengrass, his crew, Damon and the rest of the cast do an absolutely magnificent job on this film: The story is delivered outstandingly, the action is directed to perfection, and just the whole overall tone and energy of the film is pitch-perfect. Also worth mentioning is composer John Powell, whose percussion-based score more than enhances the pace and adrenaline of the film. In the end, everything comes together to create a brilliant, well-executed and just pitch-perfect action-thriller spy film, and the success and quality of this third installment in the Bourne series undoubtedly seals the trilogy's fate as one of the strongest, unfailing film trilogies in recent years, and probably the best action-thriller movies since the 60's and 70's films like The French Connection or Bullitt.",8,3,7,18 August 2007
Burn After Reading," Not what I expected: dark, over-the-top, hilarious but surprisingly poignant
","The Coen Brothers are an interesting pair, there's no doubt about that. Just as they did back in the 1980's with their debut and sophomore films, the Coens chose to follow up their most heavy-handed and serious film since Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, with a nutty, over-the-top screwball black comedy. But unlike their second film, Raising Arizona, the Coens deliver Burn After Reading with a kind of newfound cynicism attached to it; it's funny, but it's also surprisingly dark and sad, and even poignant to some extent.Based on the Coen's first wholly original screenplay since 2001's The Man Who Wasn't There, Burn After Reading features a plethora of classic Coen staples: repetitive (and brilliant) dialogue employing a strange and almost poetic use of curse words, a multifaceted plot featuring slightly dim-witted characters in way over their heads, blacker-than-the-night comedy, over-the-top performances from a pool of actors featuring recurring collaborators and newcomers to the Coen clan alike, and to tie it all off, a lesson-learning conclusion in which nothing ends up being learned at all. It's wonderful how the Coens complicate the plot so much only to round it all off perfectly in the end. Like all of their films, Burn After Reading is a carefully calculated dance in which every pause, every stutter and every camera move is planned in advance.What I loved most about the movie is trying to get into the Coen's heads and see what they think is funny. What's for sure is that the brothers have the most unique sense of humour in Hollywood; superficially, it seems as if most of the film's comedy derives from over-the-top slapstick/screwball antics and bleak, black comedic situations and visual gags, but in reality Burn After Reading's comedy is a lot subtler than that. As I already mentioned, this is a film in which every twitch and stutter is calculated; fittingly, this is the real source of the film's hilarity, in the actors' facial expressions, subtleties, and delivery of the lines. It's great to think, for instance, that the Coens probably thought that applying a booming, ominous drum-dominated 'epic'-type musical score to the movie in the style of a Tony Scott action-thriller would be absolutely hilarious, and that's just one example of the many jokes in the movie that just soar right over your head. In addition, I think that the Coen Brothers are probably the most talented employers of curse words in Hollywood. Many directors are familiar with the colourful phrases, some more than others, but only the Coens know how to make various S- and F- words utterly sidesplitting.Blessed with one of the more impressive ensemble casts of any film this year, Burn After Reading inevitably features a plethora of good acting. Surprisingly good acting, actually, proving I suppose that the Coen's didn't really mean for this to be a total farce but do reach out for a little something more. Frances McDormand, George Clooney and John Malkovich all deliver fantastically colourful, over-the-top performances, but each of their characters also has an added level of sadness and poignancy to them that adds a little something more than physical comedy to the actors' performances: McDormand with her almost tragic loneliness and obsession with cosmetic surgery, along with her equally tragic ignorance of those around her that do appreciate her for what she is; Clooney with an equal amount of loneliness and desperation, and an undeniable air of incompetence abound him, suggesting that his mediocre job is probably the best he can get; and Malkovich, with his alcoholism and acute superiority complex. Tilda Swinton and the ever-great Richard Jenkins are a lot subtler than their higher-billed co-stars, and Brad Pitt delivers the only truly one-hundred percent cartoon performance in the film; thought despite its emptiness it's also the most enjoyable and completely hilarious.J.K. Simmons I reserve for last; he only appears in two scenes in the film, but they are undoubtedly and by far the funniest and most successful scenes of the film. Props to him for admirably succeeding in carrying the Coen's hilarity to another level of deadpan comedy.The Coen Brothers have an interesting sense of humour, and it is present up front and center in their latest film. Just the concept of following up a serious drama-thriller like No Country for Old Men with an over-the-top screwball black comedy probably seemed hilarious to them. Featuring great, uproarious performances from a stellar ensemble cast, the Coens really give it their all with their offbeat, so-subtle-half-the-jokes-soar-over-your-head comedy. And yet, the film occasionally does manage to reach out a little further from its apparent genre limitations and provides us with something more poignant and truthfully sad. It's even somewhat startling just how dark the movie gets and how cruel the Coens are to their characters. It wasn't quite what I expected, but then again, that's the Coen Brothers for you.",8,24,40,18 October 2008
Watchmen," Entertaining and well-made, but some major issues with the plot
","It's impossible to write a review about a movie like this without mentioning its visual aspect, so we'll get to that now. Like his films or not, it's hard to deny that Zack Snyder knows how to direct a movie and especially make it visually appealing; there's no doubt that he's a rising star in contemporary cinema. If there's one thing that even detractors of Watchmen have to admit, it's that this film looks GOOD! And by good I mean absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. The production/set and costume design both exquisitely capture the comic book feel of the movie, but keep it dark and gritty, like it's supposed to be. It's highly stylized, but this is more like the evil twin brother version of Dick Tracy rather than like Dick Tracy itself. The special effects are, for the most part, top-notch, and Dr. Manhattan in particular serves as yet another example in the ever-improving motion capture technology, used so well in The Lord of the Rings but with mixed results since. With an exquisitely expert ability to know exactly where to place the camera and how to move it, light the scene and utilize special effects, Snyder is definitely turning out to be one of the most visually talented directors of his generation. Although his work so far has been as glossy and commercial as it gets, it's impossible to say that the man isn't creative, or that his films aren't works of art.While I immensely enjoyed and appreciated the film's thoroughly in-depth development and portrayal of its fascinating characters, rich back story and the whole Watchmen mythology in general, I still had some fundamental aspects with the actual plot, specifically with the third act. Without giving too much away, I will humbly ask how many times have we seen the 'twist'/character revelation that initiates the finale/confrontation at the end of the film? It's an old, tired plot technique that we've seen countless times before, and almost takes away from the wonderfully high quality of the first two thirds of the film. Speaking of the ending, I think it would be appropriate to address the major issue amongst fans of the graphic novel regarding the finale. Again, without giving too much away, I have been informed about the nature of the finale as it appears in the original comic by friends of mine who HAVE read it, and although there seemed to be a pretty big controversy amongst die-hard fans irrationally demanding precise and total accuracy and adherence to the source material, in my opinion, Zack Snyder made a very wise decision in changing the ending. In essence It's the same and serves the same purpose, but although the film had its fair share of supernatural and fantastical elements, mainly in the Dr. Manhattan character, all of them worked and made sense in the context of the film, and I feel that had Snyder gone with the original ending, it would have thrown the film into an entirely different direction in terms of its supernatural elements and would have been totally out of place. In general, there were a few aspects of the film that really polarized me. I thought that the best scene was actually the opening credits sequence, featuring an incredibly well-made and gorgeous looking collage of still and moving images depicting the historical setting and history of the Watchmen/Minutemen and of some of the characters, all combined in different layers with the camera sweeping through them, while Bob Dylan croons 'Oh the times they are a-changin'' on the soundtrack. On the other hand, I absolutely hated the scenes with Richard Nixon, and felt that his make-up was ridiculously over-the-top and completely out of place. I know that Snyder was just trying to capture the essence of the exaggerated, caricature-version of Nixon as he appears in the comic book, but it was just so preposterous that it completely took me out of the film.Big, event, blockbuster movies have never been the same since we entered the internet age. Unlike the blockbusters of the past  Star Wars, E.T., Batman, Jurassic Park  which we knew nothing about prior to their release except what the posters and trailers showed us, now audiences seem to know every little detail about a movie's content and production months before it is even released. The internet is not only an incredible advertising tool, what with hype and anticipation for movies increased tenfold with the help of internet message board chatter and word-of-mouth, but is also an unlimitedly powerful source of pressure, pressure on filmmakers, directors, producers and everyone involved in these projects to meet fan expectations and stick to the beloved source material, whatever it may be. Many projects recently seem to attempt to stay closer and closer to the source material, usually comic books in this case, with mixed results. Watchmen seems to fit somewhere in between the two camps of The Incredible Hulk and The Dark Knight. On the one hand, it benefits from sticking to its source material, Snyder having chosen not to skim over any of the details and aspects of the incredibly rich mythology present in the graphic novel. On the other hand, by sticking so closely to the original comic, Watchmen suffers slightly because a graphic novel, or a novel in general, will always be far richer and contain far more details, sub-plots, and in-depth character development than a movie would ever be able to fully encompass, and so I feel that Snyder may have slightly overreached in order to be faithful to the comic keep the fans of the graphic novel, which include himself, happy. Still, it's an immensely entertaining movie, incredibly well-made, fascinating and in-depth, and although I had some major issues with the plot, I still quite enjoyed it.",4,1,3,16 March 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Doesn't live up to the first Matrix
","The third and hopefully final installment in The Matrix franchise, The Matrix Revolutions has been receiving more hype than any other movie this year, starting with the worldwide release stunt, which was quite odd yet effective (The movie grossed $44 million worldwide on the first day).The plot is basically this: The freed humans are working as hard as they can to protect Zion from the upcoming machine attack. We witness about half an hour of non-stop fighting, as the humans attempt to fend off the hundreds of thousands of Sentinels the machines sent to destroy Zion. In the meantime, we jump back to the events in The Matrix Reloaded, when two hover-crafts are sent to rescue the Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of Reloaded we learned that the Nebuchadnezzar was destroyed, and it's The Hammer rescued crew. In Revolutions the Hammer sets out to rescue the Logos, captained by Niobe. After again consulting The Oracle, Neo finally realizes what he must do. He must reach the machine city in order to stop the war. Neo and Trinity take the Logos to the machine city, while the rest remain on the Hammer and attempt to return to Zion before the machine army gets there. Agent Smith has a much bigger part in this movie than in Reloaded, as he replaces the machines as the main villain. In an attempt to prevent Smith from destroying the real world, the machines aid Neo in a final showdown between him and Smith.Here's my theory. There are three things that make a Matrix movie:1) Meaning behind the words, philosophical discussions, witty dialog, elements that make you think. The first movie was full of this stuff, which is one of the things that made it great. I think that Reloaded tried TOO hard to add philosophical meaning, which is what made it less great than the first. Also, Reloaded attempted to include too much witty dialog, which in some cases (such as the Merovingian's speech about causality) is completely irrelevant to the story. Revolutions, though, had no meaning at all. It just continued what Reloaded said about the war between freedom of choice and fate, but Revolutions didn't add anything new to the philosophy of the Matrix, which is one aspect that made it weak.2) Plot, character development, etc. Once again, the first Matrix gets top marks here. While Reloaded had a storyline, it was neither as extensive nor as interesting as the original Matrix. One of the strong points in Reloaded though is the addition of many new characters. Revolutions has even less of a storyline then Reloaded had, which again, made it a weaker movie.3) Insane action sequences. The shootout in the building in the first Matrix, or the first time we are introduced to bullet time, are sequences that will never be forgotten. They added a whole new aspect to the definition of 'action'. And because that the action takes place in The Matrix, the people can do impossible things, which makes it all the more interesting to watch. Now I must say, in this factor Reloaded almost passes the original Matrix. The Burly Brawl (battle against 100 Agent Smiths) is an unforgettable scene, and the car chase on the freeway might be the greatest car chase in any movie. In Revolutions though, the only taste of Matrix action we get is a tiny sequence in the beginning, when Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph duke it out against some of the Merovingian's goons. The only other time we witness Matrix action in Revolutions is the final showdown between Neo and Smith, which I personally thought, compared to the first two movies, was weak, slow and didn't leave enough of an impact. The other major action sequence in Revolutions is the battle in Zion. My problem with this is that it just wasn't... Matrix style. When I go to see a Matrix movie, I expect to see some insane impossible stunts and intense bung-fu scenes, not just another sci-fi war scene. The action was okay, but it just didn't live up to my standards of 'Matrix action'.Watching Revolutions gave me an entire new level of appreciation towards Reloaded. I'm not sure why, but it did. Now I'm not saying that it was that bad a movie - I just personally felt that it didn't live up to the first Matrix. I, personally, was quite disappointed by The Matrix Revolutions. See it if you like the series, but lower your expectations first.",3,0,0,27 October 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," delivers in the most charmingly sweet, pure, honest, and innocent way
","It would be unfair to limit the film to one adjective. But charming is the first one that comes to mind. I really don't know how they did it, but the screenwriter Michael Arndt and directing team Dayton/Faris (Jonathan and Valerie, that is) have managed to create a movie in which we are simply so connected to the characters it's frightening. This is a very quirky bunch, and while their traits can be found in everyone we know, they are certainly extremely weird and I certainly don't know any families who are quite as odd as the Hoovers. And yet, we forge such a strong bond with each and every one of them, right from the opening pre-title introduction sequence  probably the best character introduction sequence I've seen since Magnolia. These people are just so real! It's unbelievable just how three-dimensional these characters are. They remind me of The Squid and the Whale  another recent movie that comes to mind when I think of this type of character development  these are just normal, regular people, and the filmmakers developed them as such in the most in-depth, well thought-out and just ingenious way possible.That brings me to the second adjective: Realism. If you've seen the film you know that some pretty wacky things go on in it, but in the end, these people are just plain real. They are real human beings  at least we the viewing audience come to believe. If they weren't so incredibly well thought out and detailed and rounded, we wouldn't forge such a strong bond with them. But fact of the matter is, the Hoovers have quickly become one of the most memorable cinematic families. Their traits. Their flaws. Their dreams and ambitions. Their dynamics, mannerisms, nuances. Every tiny little detail about these people is just so incredibly portrayed.Obviously, it would be unfair to say that a comedy isn't funny. When Little Miss Sunshine gets funny, it's hilarious  we're talking pitch-black dark and very quirky comedy, but it works admirably, reaching sort of a peak in the infamous, hilarious and totally wacky traffic cop scene.The acting is. Simply put, amazing. You won't see any Oscar moments here, no characters that have some particular traits that require various forms of 'method acting' to perform. This is simply actors playing a bunch of people who they are clearly quite unlike, but playing them as if they are. The shining star is young Abigail Breslin, who out-acts pretty much all of her older cast-mates. How she can embody a completely other character at such a young age is completely beyond me  and she's been doing it since age 6! Dakota Fanning, watch out! Paul Dano, the other young actor, also delivers an amazing performance. Myself being fresh out of that period of my life, I can say that his portrayal of a frustrated teenager  specifically in the scene where he just explodes (those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about) is just so true and realistic. Arkin is brilliant as the old grandfather, who is at once quite annoying and vulgar and at once the most human of all the characters. The three adult leads also deliver wonderful, nuanced performances  Toni Colette, who has quite a streak of wonderful performances in various films, particularly impressed me.But what makes the film so special is its message  and even more so, how it delivers it. Basically, the film's message can be summed up in one brilliant line delivered by Arkin's character, Grandpa Edwin: 'A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try.' This is a family who see tragedy after failure after disappointment, and it's just so, so sad to see them so down, because we love them all and we know that they don't deserve it, despite all their flaws. Seriously, this movie is absolutely brutal to its characters. But ultimately, it's absolutely inspiring. Because despite disappointment after tragedy after blow to the stomach, this family just keeps their head up and say 'so what; we'll find another way'. Their determination and devotion despite all the obstacles in their way, and their ultimate removal from their anxieties and un-winding is simply and absolutely inspirational, and extremely heartwarming.The flaw of many independent films that carry a message is that they insist upon themselves. Sometimes it works admirably  a recent example I can recall is The Fountain; it's undeniably pretentious, but by fulfilling its own expectations it works as a message film. Little Miss Sunshine delivers its message in simply the most incredibly, charmingly sweet, pure, honest, and innocent way you could ever imagine. It's just so pure. And that's really the single most engaging and appealing aspect of what is already an amazing piece of work.",8,186,254,2 December 2006
Wanted," Doesn't have much of a brain but delivers sheer, pure entertainment
","At its peak in the late 1980's and early to mid 1990's, the action movie genre provided cinema-goers, perhaps for the first time since the Golden Age of cinema, with a broad, encompassing entertainment package that was impossible to resist: big-name movie stars, laughs, thrills, and excitement all wrapped up in an easily digestible package that doesn't require too much work to unwrap. Not that easy accessibility is a bad thing, especially during those times, when despite the audience's readiness to consume, filmmakers would still give it their all and each film was a labour of love.In recent years, though, with the novelty of the superhero movie increasing tenfold in popularity, the movie-going audience was provided with a new, easily consumable source for their excitement and entertainment which promised fantasy and science-fiction along with majestic action set-pieces, and the traditional action-thriller genre was reduced to shallow, bland fare such as xXx, Mission: Impossible III or Bad Company, with a few beacons of light such as The Bourne trilogy serving as anomalous but much-welcomed exceptions. Now, with Wanted, we finally get a clear-cut action-thriller that truly, sincerely, straightforwardly delivers everything we, the viewing audience, expect and call for to be entertained.The plot itself is really quite ridiculous, but naturally, it doesn't really matter. The thing is, Wanted grabs you right from the get-go and doesn't really let loose, right through the end credits. The action scenes  and they are plentiful  are so incredibly well-conceived, well-executed, and well-choreographed that one tends to easily ignore the rather silly plot devices employed to set up said action scenes. Car chases, hand-to-hand combat, intense gun fights: the film has it all, and every scene employs incredibly skillful craftwork in terms of choreography, stunt work, cinematography, editing and visual effects, of which there are many and which are impressively seamlessly integrated into the scenes, action-oriented or otherwise. The haywire cinematography and heavily rock-oriented soundtrack also contribute to the nonstop adrenaline rush of the movie.The strong cast also undeniably contributes to the film working so well. Angelina Jolie is majestic and ascendant as the mentor, and proves once again that she's quite a sufficient action star, combining grace and ferocity in her performance. Morgan Freeman is regal as the wise overseer, but also gets to prove that he has a tougher, rougher side. But the most impressive turn is provided by James McAvoy who, between The Last King of Scotland, Atonement and now Wanted, has proved that he is a truly talented leading man. And it's not just his spot-on American accent: McAvoy supplies another one of the major reasons why the film works: he provides us with a believable, down-to-earth character we can totally identify with. So just as he is in awe being pulled in to this new, intense, high-octane new world of conspiracies, car chases and lots of killing, we the audience are right along side with him.Ultimately, the great action-thrillers of years past, like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon, worked so well primarily based on that strong human connection with the lead characters. The action movies of recent years, besides being quite generic and bland in terms of their plot and execution, featuring by-the-numbers cinematography and the same stunts and action scenes we've already seen, are sub-par primarily because they lack truly down-to-earth characters we can genuinely identify with. Also, the film is so relentless in its over-the-top intensity, wild cinematography and haywire action scenes, I was so engaged in it that I didn't even feel the need to use my brain even once. So sure, Wanted doesn't have much of a brain nor much of a heart, but it delivers sheer, pure entertainment in its most absolute, heart-pumping, seat-grabbing, eye-popping form.",7,1,4,12 July 2008
The White Ribbon," Difficult to watch, but totally rewarding
","This is not an easy film to watch, and not only because some of its themes and ideas get so far under one's skin that it becomes quite an uncomfortable viewing. It's a long, dreary, slow-paced film that places almost no emphasis on plot and instead focuses almost exclusively on characters and how they go about their lives and react to certain events that unfold over a relatively extended period of time, for a film at least. It is also in a foreign language that, no matter what, does tend to create even the slightest bit of alienation from non-native-speaking audiences. What I think is interesting is how Haneke exploits this alienation from the audience and takes it a step forward in order to further emphasize his point. The film is shot in stark black-and-white, which automatically alienates the audience because it makes us aware that we are watching a film – after all, the real world we live in is in color. In addition, Haneke has the film accompanied by a dreary, deadpan voice-over narration that, although spoken by a character in the film that experienced them firsthand, is alarmingly detached from the events depicted in the film. All of these elements serve to create an alienated and sterile environment, which serves as the launching point for Haneke's deeper themes.There have been numerous films made about the dark underbelly of a seemingly perfect and pastoral American life: films like Blue Velvet, The Ice Storm and American Beauty portray settings that seem to embody the perfect example of the American Dream and the pursuit of happiness, but these settings are revealed to have dark secrets and nothing is as pure and wonderful as it seems. Similarly, Haneke sets his film in a seemingly perfect environment: a picturesque small village in rural Germany, in which all the townsfolk are good Christians who do their jobs, go to Church and whom all know one another. And yet, as the film progresses, this village is struck by a series of tragedies, events that expose the darkness within all the town's characters. The good doctor who had an unfortunate accident with his horse turns out to not be a very good doctor at all – he verbally abuses his mistress and sexually molests his teenage daughter. The baron is a victim of numerous crimes, against his crops, his barn and eventually his son – but could he have deserved it? He seems to rule the entire town – everyone works for him and he controls everyone's fates with a wave of the hand, and if that's not the perfect embodiment of daunting totalitarianism, than what is? Even the good priest is seen to go to alarmingly extreme measures to educate and discipline his children. What is most notable about the film is that, unlike the film's American counterparts, Haneke's The White Ribbon is completely uninterested in plot. By the end of it, we never know for sure who committed the crimes that the townspeople find themselves subjected to. We hear multiple theories, but none of them are ever verified. Haneke places far more emphasis and importance on the characters and how they face these troubles; the fact that someone committed them is not as important as the fact that they transpired in the first place.Although it is a heavily allegorical and character-driven piece, another very important element that must be mentioned when discussing this film is a technical one: the cinematography. Some people were surprised this little-seen foreign film managed to nab a much-coveted Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography – but it whole-heartedly deserves it. The cinematography is nothing short of divine. Every frame is fastidiously staged, down to a T: the lighting, camera movement, composition and dynamics are pitch-perfect, and if there is one thing that must be said about the film is that it is absolutely stunningly beautiful to look at. The stark black-and-white photography lends it an air of otherworldliness; the lighting and delicate camera moves become almost ghost-like. It is certainly one of the most beautiful-looking films of 2009.As I mentioned earlier, it is not easy getting through this film. It progresses at a snail's pace, takes its time with every scene, is intentionally emotionally distant and requires a substantial intellectual investment from the viewer; but it also a tremendously rewarding film for those who do choose to make that investment. Haneke paints a harrowing portrait of a small and simple village that loses its innocence, so to speak, in the face of a rapidly changing Europe in the early 20th century. Secrets are revealed, dark secrets, and moral values are shaken to their foundations never to be the same again. But the worst part is that we witness the decline of the young generation, who represent the future – and it's not accidental that the film ends on the devastating news of the outbreak of World War I.",8,0,4,27 February 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The least cartoon-like of the three films
","Finally, an installment in the Harry Potter series that has a serious amount of intelligence. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is probably the most film-like of the three movies, and definitely the least cartoon-like. It looks like Warner Brothers made a smart move by replacing the director with a professional: Alfonso Cuaron (the new director) sure gives the impression that he knows what he's doing, unlike Chris Columbus' clumsy work on the first two Harry Potter movies. Then again, Cuaron directed some great films, such as 'A Little Princess' and 'Y tu mama tambien', while Chris Colombus' major credits are Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. It is quite understandable (and obvious) that Cuaron is the more professional of the two.One of the things that annoyed me the most about the first two films is how pastoral the world looked, especially the Hogwarts grounds. I always thought that the Quiddich sequences in the first two films looked abnormally fake, and they were my least favorite parts of both films. I'm not sure why I thought they looked so fake, but it was probably a combination of the shiny, spotless witness stands, the smooth, bright green grass and the perfect blue sky, and a very 'fake' filming style. Cuaron changes all this. His most obvious addition to the series is just how dark he managed to make the Harry Potter world. Quiddich never looked so real. Then again, in Prisoner of Azkaban you never really see the Quiddich field, as it's raining cats and dogs (not literally). The filming style of the Quiddich came, though, is so much better than that of the Quiddich games in the first two films. Also, the Hogwarts grounds are no longer so green and perfect: they are now very muddy, with ugly, pale weeds growing all over the place, and the entire place is littered with gray rocks and boulders. It just looks so much more real than the flawless, bright green grass in the first two films. Also, there is almost never a blue sky: it's always cloudy and very murky. This was a great touch, and it was a great decision to change the pastoral look of Hogwarts to a gloomier appearance.Another thing I must praise Cuaron for is the acting he managed to squeeze out of his actors: Daniel Radcliffe's (Harry) performance in the first two films always annoyed me, but Cuaron really managed to turn him into a pretty good actor. He does a great job in expressing Harry's emotions in this film, which was very important since this is when they really start getting turbulent. Rupert Grint (Ron) doesn't really have much to do except whine and look terrified, and Emma Watson's (Hermione) acting never really bothered me. But, as usual, the actors that really shine are the adults. Alan Rickman, as usual, is stunning in his role as Snape: he truly was the perfect choice. The three newcomers were also great. David Thewlis was good as Lupin, although I always imagined Lupin's character as a much more sympathetic one, but then again his condition probably really agitates him, so his attitude in some scenes is probably appropriate for his character. Gary Oldman, as usual, is excellent in his role as Sirius Black. While we're supposed to sympathize his character, at the end of the film he still looks ruddy, dirty and slightly crazy. And last but not least, Emma Thomson was excellent in her somewhat small role as Professor Trelawney: the filmmakers made her exactly how I imagined her to be.The main problem with the film is some bad storytelling at some points. For someone who read the books, watching the movie is really no problem, because they can fill in the gaps themselves according to what was in the book and not featured in the movie, but for people who haven't read the book, the movie looked to me as very difficult to understand. There were quite a few points that something wasn't explained on screen that made somewhat of a difference in the scene, and some cases in which I wouldn't have been able to understand what was going on unless I'd have read the book (which, as I mentioned before, I did). Bottom line is, it might be a bit difficult to see this film unless you know what's going on.To sum it all up, Alfonso Cuaron, the new director, certainly proved himself as someone who knows what he's doing. He's managed to improve this film from the first two in almost every aspect: acting, mood, production design, cinematography, visual effects, and of course, direction. It's really too bad that Cuaron's not directing the fourth film, Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire (this is due to the fact that filming on Goblet of Fire began while Prisoner of Azkaban was still in post-production), and I really hope that the new director will take a few leafs out of Alfonso Cuaron's book. The great thing about this film is that he's so much of a professional, movie buffs (like me, for instance) who enjoy watching 'artsy' movies, will probably like this one as well, for its artistic merits (check out some great use of time as an artistic tool near the end of the movie, mostly usage of the giant clock installed in the school in some shots I described before). But, a few things that bugged me about this movie lower its value a bit. Also, the fact that I just don't like J.K. Rowling lowered its value a bit. Final evaluation: definitely worth seeing, but it might be too complex (and quite scary, at times) for the younger ones.",8,1,2,27 October 2005
Ratatouille," Pixar's best, most subtle and most beautifully animated yet
","Firstly, in almost all of the Pixar films before it, the creators had to create and establish a very specific world: in A Bug's Life it is the world of the anthill, in Monsters Inc it is the alternate monster universe, in The Incredibles it is the sort of retro 1950's-throwback-style world populated by superheroes, and the same can be applied to their other works as well. Ratatouille, on the other hand, takes place within the real-life, contemporary 'human' world, and thus does not need to establish the physics and dynamics of its own alternate universe  much humour is usually derived from the parallels between it and our real world and from the absurdity of the mechanics of these universes.Another major difference is how Bird treats his themes. Major, educational themes have been the center of most animated movies since the oldest days of Disney and right up through the contemporary Pixar age. But what can more than certainly be said about pretty much all the rest of the Pixar movies is that they never try to hide their messages  in fact, I thought that the over-obviousness and simplicity of the message that appeared in Cars was what made it slightly less-appreciated among other Pixar projects. In Ratatouille, not only is the film absolutely brimming with overlaying themes and messages, but Bird at the same time never lets them take the wheel, and always keeps them looming overhead the actual plot and storyline. Themes such as friendship, loyalty, teamwork, and accepting the different and the unexpected can all be found in the film, but never once does Bird force-feed us his message, and for that I appreciate him all the more.The story itself is of course fantastically executed and an absolute wonder to behold. It's touching, original, extremely clever and just plain fun. It's crazy but never enters the territory of absurd, and we always believe in it. The dynamics between Remy and Linguini are also brilliantly carried out, and they work together so incredibly well. But ultimately, the key to the film's success is the utter believability and realism of its characters. We totally believe in the dynamics between the two and in their own particular character traits and quirks. It's just so well done; and I must also mention that the character of Remy was designed in the most absolutely and utterly adorable, eat-you-up way possible! He just puts a smile on your face every time he wiggles his little nose.The animation in the film is nothing short of revolutionary. It is easily the most incredibly well done and the best looking computer animated film made yet, in every aspect. Images that were once flat back in Toy Story become so realistically alive, it's quite mind-boggling to tell you the truth. The use of focus in the animation is so incredibly spot-on perfect and works so realistically in comparison to how it would actually work in real life, its almost hard to believe that this isn't done in real cameras. Add to that absolutely stunning lighting, colouration and textures, and you get some elements of the film that almost seem completely real  just look for example at the piece of bread near the beginning of the film, or the water in the river or the texture of the cobblestones on the street. It's unbelievable! I usually don't refer to the voice acting in a movie because I feel its redundant, and I'm also not a fan of using big celebrity voices just for the sake of having them, unless they are actually used dynamically in the animated character itself or if they are seamlessly integrated, as they are in Ratatouille. But I must bring up one particular vocal performance in this film that just had me grinning every time his character came on screen and his voice started booming: Casting Peter O'Toole as the voice of food critic Anton Ego was a stroke of genius quite unlike any other voice casting decision in ANY other animated film ever  or at least since the casting of Robin Williams as the voice of the Genie in Aladdin. His voice, instantly recognizable, fits the character of Ego so incredibly well, it's almost eerie. And he of course gives a brilliant performance, creating one of the most humorous characters in the entire film.Ratatouille is another five-star success added to Pixar's already high-standard repertoire. It is just as touching, human, real, convincing and emotional as any other Pixar film, although to its credit Bird makes sure that its major themes and messages aren't too obviously or prominently featured, keeping everything subtle and putting the plot and characters first  which are all equally brilliantly done. The animation is the most vivid, perfect and absolutely beautiful in any animated movie yet, and it all fits in together perfectly with the very sly and unique Pixar sense of humour. I of course expected nothing less from the studio, and am now even more brimming with confidence about their next project, Wall-E, after the slight stumble that was last year's Cars. Easily the best movie yet this summer.",9,5,8,21 July 2007
Tropic Thunder," Above your average ridiculously stupid comedy
","A question of comparison almost as common as 'Pepsi or Coca Cola?' that often arises asks to choose the favourite between Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller. Both have very different comedic styles that cater to different kinds of audiences: Sandler is more exaggerated and crude, while Stiller seems to be more sophisticated and gravitates more towards parody than grossing out, although in my opinion he is the less funny of the two. So while Zoolander was a very clever send-up of the male fashion world, it just wasn't that funny besides the uncanny number of celebrity cameos. Luckily for Stiller, in his most recent directorial effort, Tropic Thunder, which parodies every possible aspect and angle of Hollywood Â– actors, producers, directors, screenwriters, agents, genres, award shows, trailers, and everything in between Â– he brings along a crew of hilarious comic talents to help him deliver the laughs.The film is, first and foremost, a rather clever parody of everything Hollywood, featuring washed-up action stars, prestigious Oscar-winning Australian method actors, overweight, drug-addicted comedic actors who appear in multiple roles in crude humour movies, rappers making the transition into film, actors who play mentally disabled characters for awards attention, crazed producers, British theatre directors making their film debuts, novelists who are exposed as frauds, crazed agents, and many more. The film-within-a-film, the Vietnam war epic Tropic Thunder, which appears prominently in the first few scenes of the film, is also a clever and more subtle prod at war epics, featuring over-the-top gore, exaggerated pyrotechnics and every clichÃ© in the book. These elements are no doubt the contribution of Justin Theroux to the screenplay. Theroux hasn't actually written any screenplays before, but as an actor he often plays these kind of slyly, subtly comic characters, and it seems to fit his style. Then again, the film also contains a scene in which a character wrestles with a panda bear, eventually kills it and wears its skin, so the movie's styles and levels of humour are evidently varied.Most of the flat-out jokes in the film aren't quite as funny as they could be, but the film benefits from an exquisite collective of comic genius at its core. Stiller himself, although playing the main character, plays him as the straightest arrow in the group and in the least exaggerated manner, and thus puts himself really aside the comic limelight and lets his co-stars take centre stage. Each one has his shining moment, including Jay Baruchel and Nick Nolte, and Jack Black in particular has two or three scenes that he just lets loose and gives it his all. But there's no doubt about it that this is Robert Downey, Jr.'s show.Downey, Jr. has, in the last couple of years of his comeback, shown superb acting virtuosity in both comedic (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly) and dramatic (Fur, Zodiac) roles in small indie films, but 2008 will certainly go down in history as the defining year for him, the year where at long last the talented but troubled actor has hit A-list status and has become a bona-fide movie star, bringing in the crowd. Showcasing lighter fare in Iron Man and comic genius in Tropic Thunder, one can only wonder how he will fare dramatically in Joe Wright's The Soloist, out later this year. I have my fingers crossed for Downey, especially since he absolutely carried Tropic Thunder and delivered the funniest lead performance in a very bold feat of portraying a black man that worked off perfectly.But with all due respect to Downey, Jr., even he is out-acted by the extended cameo role that totally steals the show. It took me quoting lines from Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia to my friends for them to realize that the actor portraying the hairy, bald, overweight film producer Les Grossman is none other than Tom Cruise. Off-screen persona aside, there's no denying Cruise's abilities in this movie. He is still one of the most talented, screen presence-commanding actors working today, and his show-stealing, profanity-laden performance in Tropic Thunder just further proves his ability at carrying a movie and stealing the show, even when he's only in it for a few scenes. Downey, Jr. carried the film, but Cruise was the highlight of the experience for me.There's no tiptoeing around the fact that Tropic Thunder is a ridiculously stupid movie. But the fact that it's so over-the-top shows that, naturally, it doesn't take itself seriously. Combining clever lampooning of everything that signifies modern Hollywood with brilliant, all-cylinders-pumping comedic performances from the likes of Jack Black and Robert Downey, Jr., Tropic Thunder places itself above your average ridiculously stupid comedy.",7,0,0,18 October 2008
No Country for Old Men," A masterpiece if I've ever seen one; the Coens are back in form, their best film yet
","The film represents a downright uncanny application of cinematic craft on the Coen's part. They deliver storytelling in its most flawless, raw, visceral form, and indeed the film has quite the incredible story to tell, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy (which I have intentionally put off reading in order to enjoy the film to the fullest, although I fully intend to seek it out now  by the way, if anybody hasn't read McCarthy's Pulitzer-Prize winning novel 'The Road', do so now). But the Coens have long before transcended telling a mere plot. The film provides its best storytelling when there is no dialogue. Notice with what utter grace and absolute perfection the Coens create tension and drama. From the first moment he appears on screen, we are scared petrified of the Anton Chigurh character, and the Coens have calculated the introduction of his appearance and mannerisms so that every time he merely walks onto the screen, we get chills down our spine. Behold probably the most amazingly directed sequence of any film this year, which involves Llewelyn Moss sitting in his motel room and hearing what are clearly Chigurh's footsteps coming down the hall, until his shadow appears under the crack of the door. But if only that were all  Chigurh continues to turn off the light, drenching the scene in pitch-darkness. No other scene in any other film this year has more effortlessly created tension and true, primal fear within me as a viewer. And the scene continues, as Llewelyn apprehends a vehicle, immediately after which the windshield begins to shatter from Chigurh's shots that are being fired from who knows where, which further elevates the pressure. One of the scariest scenes in any film this year cannot be found in The Mist, or in 1408, or in any of the shock-horror pictures put out, but rather can be found right near the beginning of No Country, as the Chigurh character enters a small gas station shop and manages, without doing much at all besides playing an almost-too-calm word game with the teller, to obstinately petrify and terrorize us. I don't think a screen character has ever been depicted as more nervous than that of the store clerk in the scene in question. It is precisely these characters, such as that of the store clerk or the overweight landlady at the trailer park, that make this film so unmistakably Coen. Their mannerisms and way of talking, while not meant to be comic, are presented in an almost comic fashion. It is that unique Coen sense of humour, in which they turn the nerve-racking edginess and anxiety in the gas station scene with Chigurh into a comic moment. The Coens have an uncanny ability to create comedy simply out of the absurdity of the situation. Not a word is wasted, and every strand of dialogue, every line and passage, is absolutely and entirely pitch-perfect; it is an incredible, extraordinary screenplay.The Coens had previously reached a creative peak with Fargo, but No Country for Old Men serves as a new high for the directorial duo, and if Michelangelo can have both the Sistine Chapel and his statue of David, then surely the Coens are entitled to their two masterpieces; the classic Fargo and the modern No Country. The pieces can be further viewed as companions due to their striking similarities in terms of themes, setting and visuals; both featuring stark, horizon-reaching landscapes, regular-guy characters who get mixed up with the very wrong people, and police officers as the moral cores of the film and ultimately the central subject matter. But if Fargo delivered a more uplifting moral closure with the story of Marge Gunderson, No Country for Old Men is far more pessimistic, delivering a scathing life lesson in the depressing closure to Ed Tom Bell's tale. As in all of their films, No Country also features that very specifically Coen brothers sense of humour, which can turn even a dark and menacing dramatic thriller into a comedy by playing off the ridiculousness of the characters and the situations they get themselves into. The film also serves as a stunning, remarkable application of cinematic craft, featuring absolutely stupefying direction, cinematography, editing, production value and everything in between. Working from an utterly brilliant screenplay from the Coens, the actors deliver unnerving, compelling, show-stealing performances, in particular Tommy Lee Jones as the scarred old timer for whom this violent country is certainly no place; Josh Brolin in a brilliant lead-role debut as the naive average Joe who gets mixed in way over his head with unstoppable forces of nature; and Javier Bardem, as the ruthless, terrifying, primeval villain and embodiment of pure evil. It is a striking, epic, complex, many-leveled work of seething bleakness and stunning desolation, delivering an all-around depressing moral and human outcome. It is a movie that lives and breathes through its fascinating characters, its visceral settings, its striking visuals. It is the best film of the year, and an astounding, incredible cinematic achievement on all possible planes. The Coens have truly outdone themselves and have finally sealed their spot as one of if not the most important modern-day cinematic auteurs. May we see only work like this from them in the future  a masterpiece if I've ever seen one.",10,4,8,4 January 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," An epic, sprawling splendor of cinema
","The Assassination of Jesse James is an epic, sprawling splendor of cinema, right from its title and through its near-three-hour running time. Dominik and everyone else involved have taken a huge chance with this, as it is a creation that could so easily go wrong, lose its focus, wander off and leave the audience apathetic and bored. Luckily for Dominik, he has the best the cinematic craft has to offer in order to help him along. Starting from perhaps some of the best use of voice-over narration since American Beauty, Dominik manages to capture us and draw us into the whirlwind that is the life and times of Jesse James. Like in Terrence Malick's films, the plot takes backseat to atmosphere, character, and beauty. The film is not about the last robbery of the James brothers, nor is it about the course of their lives after the train robbery that opens the film. Thinking back, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to even recollect any major plot points in the film; certainly not enough to fill its entirety. What interests Dominik are his characters, namely those of Jesse James and Robert Ford but also many others surrounding them, and their ever-changing relationship and dynamics leading up to James' inevitable, title-featured assassination. The film portrays an atmosphere, feelings, musings and character far more than it presents a tangible, developing plot.Extraordinarily for a sophomore film project, especially that of a foreign director, Dominik surrounds himself with the finest cinematic craftsmen Hollywood has to offer. In true Malickian form, Dominik allows these technical, visual aspects to occasionally take center stage and further accentuate the feelings, character emotions, and the atmosphere he is trying to evoke. What particularly stands out is the absolutely stunning cinematography by now-legend Roger Deakins, easily one of the greatest cinematographers working in Hollywood today and second only to Emmanuel Lubezki and Janusz Kaminski in my opinion. Like Malick's two Western masterpieces, Badlands and Days of Heaven, but also featured prominently in his two more recent subsequent features, Dominik embellishes his film with extended shots of the beautiful, wide-open vistas of the rolling fields and wide-open spaces of the 19th century American frontier.Dominik did not only luck out on his technical team, but also with his wonderfully talented acting troupe. His two leading men, one a long-time Hollywood A-lister and the other surely a shoo-in for the same list in the very near future, deliver exquisite, powerful work that is a peak for both of their careers. Brad Pitt, the veteran, observed in a recent interview that he seems to be getting better with each subsequent film role and finds his older work incomparable to his more recent efforts. I have to admit, the man has a point. Although stellar in Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club, Pitt also excelled at delivering bland, single-note performances in films such as Seven Years in Tibet or Meet Joe Black. Recently he has been truly out-doing himself and if his subdued, grayed turn in last year's Babel was the best performance he had delivered up until that point, he manages to even exceed that with his incredible, powerful, dominant role as Jesse James. Pitt nails every little quirk in James; his mannerisms, his ticks, his glances and smirks. His performance is so powerful it dominates the entire film even during extended sequences without his character. But the true stunner is Casey Affleck, who has appeared in smaller background roles in his brother's previous movies but has had two chances this year to truly shine. If Gone Baby Gone seals his abilities as a strong leading man, The Assassination of Jesse James, while not a lead role, certainly seals his undeniable talent as an actor. It is one of those performances that is so exhilarating and entrancing to watch, one can't wait for the character to return to the screen and relishes every moment with him. Another powerful characterization, Affleck absolutely nails the kind of naïve, wide-eyed wonder of Robert Ford, and his interactions with Jesse James; his sheepish grins, his feeble attempts to impress, his embarrassment. It is an incredible, powerful performance that were it not for Javier Bardem would surely be a lead contender for the best supporting performance of the year. Also worth a mention is the criminally underrated Sam Rockwell, who in movie after movie is able to deliver wonderful, fascinating turns. How his leading turn in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind didn't transform him into one of the most reliable leading men on the scene is way beyond me, and I look forward to all of his work. He manages to inject just enough of himself in all of his roles while still remaining loyal to the source material. I hope his big break is on the way.This year saw a revival and an abundant resurgence in two old-Hollywood film genres; the musical and the Western. Between this, 3:10 to Yuma, and the less traditional There Will Be Blood and No Country for Old Men, one could very easily attribute this year as the year of the Western renaissance. It's no coincidence that these four titles are also among the best of the year. I have not seen his previous effort, Chopper, but The Assassination of Jesse James is enough for me to certify Andrew Dominik as a directorial force to be reckoned with. The film truly stands out in a year abundant in excellent sophomore films (for example, Juno and Atonement, just to name a couple), and although not quite the masterpiece it wants to be, it certainly comes as close to it as possible.",9,0,1,14 February 2008
Batman Begins," One of the best comic book movies ever
","Tim Burton's 'Batman' is the best movie of the Batman series, but Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' isn't too far behind. As a stand-alone movie, though, it sure does deliver, and etches itself a very high place in the 'superhero movie' genre.Christopher Nolan, who directed 'Memento', one of the most engaging and brilliant films of the past decade, decides to take a turn for the more mainstream and straightforward with 'Batman Begins'. But his great director's flair is still present, and he delivers one excellent movie. Unlike previous installations of 'Batman', including Tim Burton's, Nolan's Batman is completely real. Most comic-book movies, including the first Batman movies, tend to have that 'comic book' feel to them. They are colorful, visually exciting, entertaining, but ultimately unbelievable. Everything in the 'Batman Begins' world is completely realistic and plausible, and it's this plausibility that draws you right into the world, and helps you identify ever so much with the characters and the situations they are in. The movies in the X-Men series, especially X2, benefit from this same element, as does Spider-Man 2 to some extent, but most comic book movies don't have this type of realism (Hulk, Daredevil, etc). Characters' vulnerability, emotions and concerns seem ever so real, which adds so much to the film experience.While Tim Burton successfully managed to craft an extremely three-dimensional Batman/Bruce Wayne, and also managed to flesh out his relations with his enemies, Christopher Nolan also succeeds  but in a different way. The Batman/Bruce Wayne character in 'Batman Begins' is so real that it's very easy to identify with his situation, and his struggle. The movie also cleverly and successfully manages to express Batman's motives, his reason for doing what he does, for fighting his fight. It's so rare to see a clever script in a summer blockbuster movie lately, but Batman's script, story-wise and thematically, is exceptionally good. Nolan also manages to create and flesh out great villains. It seemed to me that the quality of the villains in the Batman movies was steadily declining, to a point that in the 4th movie, the villains are Freeze, Poison Ivy and Bane, possibly the most ridiculous villains in any comic book movie. 'Batman Begins' creates two excellent and realistic villains  no silly costumes, no weird deformations, and extremely three-dimensional. The first, 'Scarecrow', is EXTREMELY creepy, and was executed in an excellent way. In the comics he was a bit lame, but the movie really makes him cool. And the second villain 'Ra's Al Ghul' well, you'll have to see the movie for yourself, I wouldn't want to ruin it.The acting is superb. Never since Michael Keaton has Batman/Bruce Wayne been played so well. Christian Bale plays him, and the contrast between the Bruce Wayne persona and the Batman character is cleverly emphasized by change in style of dialog, attitude, and even tone of speech. Of course, this is all in order to emphasize the change Bruce Wayne has to go through, personality-wise, to become Batman, who is essentially someone whom his nature shouldn't allow to exist. Nolan has also managed to collect himself an excellent supporting cast. Michael Caine plays Alfred the butler, in a different way from the Alfred who accompanied all four of the previous installments, but also, in my opinion, in a more realistic way. Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox, the man behind Batman's equipment and gadgets. Liam Neeson plays Ducard, Ra's Al Ghul's assistant, and the man who trains Bruce Wayne. Tom Wilkinson plays Carmine Falcone, a bad guy but not a villain, with a strong, mock-American gangster accent, which gives him character and charm. Cillian Murphy plays Dr. Jonathan Crane aka Scarecrow with such creepiness and malice. Even without the Scarecrow getup, Dr. Crane is one creepy character. And when he's in the Scarecrow getup spooky. Gary Oldman plays Jim Gordon, whose role has never been bigger and whose character has never been more fleshed out. And finally, Katie Holmes plays the love interest, Rachel Dawes. She acts fine, she just doesn't stand out among the rest of the cast.The film is also made exceptionally well. Surprising enough, it's a summer blockbuster that isn't based on CGI effects. In fact, aside from some bats, I'm pretty sure that everything else appears as it was filmed, directly on-camera with no tampering. This is quite impressive, but obviously comes from Nolan's lack of blockbuster movie-making experience. Gotham City looks much different than it did in the previous installments. I still think that Burton's slightly over-the-top but extremely Gothic Gotham City is the best, but it gets really out of hand and over the top in Batman 3 and 4, so 'Batman Begins' is a nice change. There's absolutely nothing over-the-top about Gotham City in 'Batman Begins', which I suppose is a welcome change seeing as the movie is aspiring to realism. The action scenes are also EXTREMELY well crafted and photographed. And don't think that this movie is all about characters and drama. 'Batman Begins' isn't short on action scenes at all. They are plentiful, exciting and they deliver.Despite all these good things, 'Batman Begins' also stumbles here and there. Some of the dialog isn't that good, some lines and elements are repeated too much, and some of the events are kind of cliché. But, these problems are minor, and can only be expected from a summer blockbuster made first and foremost to please the masses.All in all, 'Batman Begins' is a great movie, which is hugely successful on almost every level, including of course entertainment value. If you want to have a good time in the cinema AND see a great movie, 'Batman Begins' is the film for you. I rank it as one of the best comic book movies ever, up there with the first two Batman films, X2 and Spider-Man 2.",8,1,1,27 October 2005
Revolutionary Road," A visually stunning, expertly acted, good-looking and well-made drama
","If one thing can be said about Mendes, it's that his career has been very eclectic: although all three of his previous movies have depicted distinctly American themes, each was in an entirely different genre and setting. With Revolutionary Road, Mendes comes full circle with his first film, American Beauty, and explores similar themes but with far more subtlety. It is this subtlety that I felt was eventually the film's biggest flaw, but we'll get to that later. Let's start with what was good, in the film, and that gives us a lot of ground to cover. As with his previous films, the production value is truly second to none. With the costume and set design, Mendes has managed to flawlessly capture Eisenhower-era American suburbia of the 1950's down to every little detail of the period. And second-time-collaborator Roger Deakins provides a startling, subtle-but-beautiful visual look for the film, perfectly capturing both the period and the contrast between its diffused, sunlit posterior to the stormy, tremulous interior of the lives of the protagonists.The story itself is simple but allows for the profound, in-depth exploration of themes. While Mendes' previous films have appeared broad, well-known ensemble casts, with this film he goes a little subtler, and aside from his two main players the cast are mostly unknowns. That said, he was blessed with his two leads, who are two of the best actors working today and also two of my favourites: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who worked together for the first time over 10 years ago on Titanic, have proved that they have grown up significantly since the cruise liner disaster movie. Their performances are simply riveting, and they truly bring the fairly simple story of the film to life. While DiCaprio, an actor who has really been rising recently in terms of the quality of his projects and the range of his acting, delivers a striking, dramatic, visceral performance; and yet, distinction can be made that, in my opinion, Winslet out-acts DiCaprio: I haven't read the original novel but from the movie I got the impression that it was more about her than about him. So with Winslet taking center stage, she really delivers on a tremendous level. She nails everything from body language to subtle character quirks to the large, bombastic, dramatic fight scenes, and delivers a performance so poignant and resonant that one can't help but admire her. The thing with Winslet is that she does this with pretty much every role, which is why she is such a good actress in my opinion.So what's the movie really about? Well, I saw it as an examination, a breakdown of the American Dream. The classic meaning of that term is divided into three major categories: liberty, prosperity and the pursuit of happiness. The film seems to shoot this very mythological idea of the American Dream down, and depicts a situation in which one category comes in stead of the other: in order to be free, we must release ourselves from the obligations of financial success. In order to be rich and prosperous, we must give up our freedoms and liberties in life. And happiness? I felt that the film dealt most with happiness, as both freedom and prosperity seem to contain a little bit each of that third category, but in both cases true, complete happiness seems to be a compromise in both cases. What is the meaning of happiness? Shouldn't two beautiful children, a large, cozy home and financial security also ensure happiness? Or must me always seek more from life? Both characters in the film are adulterous, but they also both find out that infidelity is not an effective escape from their unhappiness. One gets the impression, that even if the characters would end up moving to Paris, they would be unhappy there as well, and what fuels their temporary happiness seems to be the fantasy of getting away, and not the actual act.With Revolutionary Road, his fourth film, Sam Mendes has crafted yet another visually stunning, expertly acted, good-looking and well-made drama; the performances by DiCaprio and Winslet are simply phenomenal, and while the plot seems simple, it contains complex characters and explores deep, rich themes. Here within lies Revolutionary Road's biggest flaw: Mendes has explored these themes of the meaning of the American Dream before, in his debut film and the utter masterpiece American Beauty, and I felt that the former film explored these themes and delivered that message far more effectively than this latest one. Where Revolutionary Road was restrained and subtle, American Beauty went all-out and held nothing back. And it is this very repetition that restricted this film to being good but not the masterpiece I was hoping it to be.",9,1,3,11 January 2009
Across the Universe," Unoriginal and uneven but dazzlingly beautiful and unique
","'Is there anybody going to listen to my story all about the girl who came to stay?' Julie Taymor's ambitious Beatles musical opens with her main character crooning this classic Beatles tune in a sad, melancholy tone longing for his love, quite reminiscent of Ewan McGregor's crooning David Bowie's 'Nature Boy' longing for his love. The similarities are hard to miss, and this one song alone effectively sums up my whole opinion on the film, which is a series of parallel conflicts and contradictions that somehow all work in the end.On the one hand, Taymor's movie has many flaws. It is very simplistic and although it deals with large political and universal themes of the time it portrays, it doesn't really bring anything new to the table. We've seen the whole hippy-getting-drafted-to-Vietnam tale in Hair, and we've seen the all-you-need-is-love theme in Moulin Rouge, which Taymor's picture reminded me of greatly. The story at its core is one of utmost simplicity: boy meets girl on the background of 1960's America political upset. The characters themselves are paper thin, each having about one or two identifying characteristics and one very straightforward character arc, and nothing more.But Taymor's work also delivers such immense beauty and brilliance in other fields that the two natures of the film overlap each other. As simple as it is, the epic boy-meets-girl tale outstandingly works on both an entertainment and on an emotional level. Once we reach the film's finale, we do feel for the characters and we are moved by their final gestures of ultimate love, despite their being thin and underdeveloped.But the film's true beauty lies in its visual and musical styles. Visually, the film is an accomplishment of unreachable levels. I haven't the slightest idea where Taymor drew her visual style from, as it is indescribably, remarkably beautiful and utterly original and never been seen before. Her film contains such downright amazing imagery, such as ocean waves clashing juxtaposed with protesting citizens clashing into walls of police forces, an incredible underwater sequence, a New York loft apartment becoming the sky, soldiers carrying the Statue of Liberty through a miniature Vietnam jungle (singing 'She's So Heavy' while doing so, no less), and five Salma Hayek army field nurses. The film is, no doubt about it, a sight to behold. But it's not just the sights that make this film such a unique beauty. It's also the sounds.For the Beatles' song adaptations, I truly and honestly salute Taymor and her crew. In this film she has created some absolutely exceptional productions. Naturally, the film's most beautiful, touching, poignant and best scenes are the ones involving the musical numbers. It's not just the songs, it's the entire scenes Taymor crafts around them that don't just feature the song  they embody the song. And being a die-hard fan of The Beatles' music, it was just these parts featuring their tunes that were the most special for me. There are 33 Beatles numbers throughout the whole film, but a few truly stood out for me. 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', which was consummately transformed from an innocent song about young love to a sad, melancholy tune of unrequited love without changing the lyrics whatsoever; 'Get By with a Little Help from my Friends', which features the Ivy League gang and Jude ransacking and running wild around Princeton; 'I've Just Seen A Face', as Jude sees Lucy for the first time; 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)', featuring Max arriving to the drafting office and striking imagery of soldiers trudging through a miniature Vietnam jungle carrying the weight of the Statue of Liberty on their backs; 'Strawberry Fields Forever', as Jude spirals down into frustration while bleeding strawberries are pinned to his wall; 'Happiness is a Warm Gun', 'Hey Jude', 'Because', and of course 'All You Need is Love' are my favourites.After I first saw the film, I wasn't entirely sure what to think, as my thoughts were so conflicting and contradicting. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it is a lot more complex than just a simple love story. It is in the simplicity that lies the key. The film isn't just a film that draws inspiration from and features The Beatles' songs. It breathes them; the songs literally embody the film. They are one and the same, drawing from one another. Have The Beatles' songs ever featured in-depth and intricate characters, or have they always been about simple, universal, undisputed love, especially their old works? Also, notice how the film begins with their older songs  'Girl', 'I Want To Hold your Hand', 'Hold Me Tight', 'All My Loving', 'I've Just Seen a Face'; in the middle are the psychedelic songs  'I am the Walrus', 'The Benefit of Mr. Kite'; and in the end their later works  'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', 'Hey Jude', 'All You Need is Love'. The film forms an arc similar to The Beatles' discography, and I don't think it is by chance.Ultimately, with Across the Universe, Julie Taymor creates a piece of film-making that simultaneously draws from many other sources before it such as Hair and Moulin Rouge, but also exists as a totally original and unique piece of art. Although Taymor's characters can be described as rather flat, we still do feel for them and by the film's finale are entirely emotionally engaged with them. The musical adaptations are downright incredible, absolutely beautiful and truly a revelation, and Taymor's cast of unknowns delivers incredibly well. The film doesn't always work. Whenever Taymor trails off and loses focus from her main plot line, the film can become rather tedious; the scenes with Bono and Eddie Izzard are particularly irritating. But on a whole, this is an ambitious, beautiful achievement in the movie musical genre with its ups, downs and contradictions but that ultimately works.",7,0,2,2 November 2007
I Am Legend," Exceeded my expectations; well-made and well-acted entertainment with some flaws
","Shots of the film's main character (and, for the most part, the only character), Dr. Robert Neville, going through his daily routine in an abandoned Manhattan in a sequence looking like the opening scenes in 28 Days Later tenfold featured in the trailer and seemed quite nice, but later shots of Neville's encounters with the 'Dark Seekers', the film's half-vampire half-zombie creatures made me think that most of the movie would depict his action-filled fight against them. I was most pleasantly surprised to find that most of the film is devoted to depicting precisely the former: a day-in-the-life portrayal of Neville's routine. What is surprising in these sequences is the immense amount of detail director Francis Lawrence and his team go into in order to make the experience as believable and real as possible. The portrayal of the mundane routines Neville goes through every day being pretty much the last man on earth, such as keeping a daily video diary, or his daily radio broadcast announcing his existence to any other survivors in the world.So how does Lawrence keep the audience interested enough to invest in a film that for the most part depicts the daily routine of the last man on earth? With three simple steps. The first being total immersion of the audience in the reality of the world. We are captured by the film's opening shots of an abandoned Manhattan, which put the opening sequence of Vanilly Sky to shame. Lawrence has us totally convinced to the authenticity of this situation, which makes us able to invest into even the smallest commotions. Second, he fills Neville's life with such small, local dramas that, due to the urgency of his existence and the harsh reality of the world, create a strong emotional impact with us: Neville's developing relationship with his dog, for example, or his occasional forays into the realm of the Dark Seekers, in particular one specific sequence which Lawrence directs with a surprisingly effective sense of dread and true, sincere tension and terror. One can easily compare these dramatic tools to those featured in Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away, another film that features one character carrying almost the entire film on his shoulders alone. In that film, we are quickly accustomed to Chuck's sudden and urgent change in reality, and the smallest occurrences in the mundane, routine-based life he has accustomed for himself become big and dramatically significant events, things such as his discovering fire, a piece of scrap metal washing on shore, and his developing relationship with a volleyball, which to the film's credit is a little more difficult to serve as an emotional investment than a dog is, although I Am Legend handles the field nicely as well. Finally, Lawrence injects these sequences with occasional flashbacks to a time immediately before the outbreak of the disaster alluding to the events pertaining to Neville's own personal family, his wife and daughter, and the fate in store for them. These sequences unfold as their own dramatic arc, which keeps us invested, but is not enough to finish off the story.The film also has one major element working to its advantage that keeps it going, and that is the immensely talented Will Smith who, similar to Tom Hanks in Cast Away, carries almost the whole movie entirely on his own. Smith delivers a very fine performance with far more depth and intensity than one would expect from the genre, and manages not only to carry the film on his shoulders but also manages to keep the audience emotionally invested in his ventures. Smith's portrayal of Neville is not one of the brave, devoted soul persistent in saving the world, although at first it may seem so. No, it is the portrayal of a broken and deeply scarred individual who has conversations with mannequins in order to fill his life with at least a symbolic dose of human relation; an individual who has lost all possible hope for salvation; an individual who determinedly continues his life's work from before the apocalyptic event not in order to save humanity but in order to give himself a reason to keep on living. Three major events that occur around the end of the second act and the beginning of the third act carry an immense emotional weight on Smith's character, who is used to routine and enters a state of manic shock triggered any external events, and Smith plays these scenes to utmost tragic perfection.Lawrence, having no other choice, introduces a very major turn of events occurring in the final third of the film that is not only necessary for the dramatic development and closure of the film but is also handled surprisingly well. Naturally I will avoid going into details, but I will say that although I had anticipated the eventual inclusion of such an event, I was most pleasantly surprised at the way Lawrence chose to handle it. That said, the film backs itself into a corner in the final ten minutes or so, and rushes into a rather disappointing ending which, naturally, I will not divulge here and which brings inevitable closure to the dramatic arc, though I would have much preferred an ending more on par with the film's previous levels of poignancy. Also, while the CGI-induced creation of a post-apocalyptic New York City devoid of any other human life is a spectacle to behold, I must admit that the CGI-created zombie creatures are somewhat of a disappointment, and don't always sell perfect believability to the audience. Still, I admit that the film exceeded my expectations, was a lot smarter and better handled than I thought it would be, and of course serves as a solid piece of entertainment, well acted and well made.",7,0,2,3 January 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The best film of 2008; an instant classic!
","Visually, the film is absolutely breathtaking. Fincher is no stranger to strong visuals and all of his movies feature absolutely stunning cinematography. As on his previous works, on Benjamin Button, Fincher works with a cinematographer mostly known for his work in music videos and commercials. Claudio Miranda, who also worked as a gaffer on almost all of Fincher's previous films but who hasn't worked very much as cinematographer on feature films, delivers absolutely breathtaking work on this film  it is definitely the best-looking and most gorgeously shot movie of the year, and a definite shoo-in for any cinematography awards, including the Oscar. With Fincher, you know that every single element of the visual language is carefully planned; from lenses to variations in aperture to depth of field to wonderful compositions to the best and most stunningly beautiful and amazing use of lighting in any film this year, using a combination of lighting temperatures, from hot and warm to cold and somber; creating sharp contrasts on the one hand and soft, lush glows on the other; sometimes bathed in light and sometimes dark and gloomy, from various sources including both superficial and natural, in-frame light. Visually, the film is nothing less than a work of art, and is one of the best looking films I've seen recently. And the fact that it was all shot digitally on the new Thompson VIPER camera, the same one Fincher used on Zodiac, makes it even more impressive, because it's easily the best-looking digital photography I've seen yet.But there's so much more! While the film is undeniably rich in every way possible, much of its vibrancy derives not only from its visual prowess but also mainly from its impeccable story. The basic premise itself is so wondrously simple it can almost too easily slip into being taken for granted: A man is born at the age of 80 and ages backwards. It's a mind-bending concept that, in the film, is treated not much as a shocking anomaly but is almost taken for granted, and generally seems widely accepted. This basic idea is the foundation of the film, but it is also one of the only things the movie has in common with the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story it is based on. The bulk of the film's content comes from the brilliant, exceptional mind of Eric Roth, who is by far one of the best screenwriters working today and who has delivered deep, fascinating, incredible work on multiple occasions in the past. The most prominent of these earlier screenplays is his Oscar-winning Forrest Gump, and his Benjamin Button script has much in common with the former screenplay. Both feature whimsical characters with a unique condition, a condition that dictates their perception and experience of events as they make their way forward through time and history. Also, both feature a love story that lasts throughout the ages, over the years and years of the story. Finally, both films seem to feature a similar kind of attitude and nature to them: a quirky, wonderful combination of humour on the one hand, deep and profound drama and romance on the other, and intricate character development on the third. Its brilliant, unique, imaginative and wonderful fantasy-element concept of a man aging backwards; grand, encompassing scale and broad themes of undying love and life are what make it a good screenplay; but what makes it a great screenplay is Roth's impeccable attention to detail. He provides us with wonderfully well-developed main characters and lays out the foundations of their strange but wonderful romance, but every one of the supporting characters in the film also has a unique, terrifically well-developed personality: from Mr. Gateau, to Queenie and Tizzy, to Captain Mike to Elizabeth Abbott, Roth provides every single one of the characters that Benjamin encounters along his journey with a distinctive personality, and it is that very element that makes the film so worthwhile.The phrase 'instant classic' gets thrown around a lot, but in any given year I can only think of a handful of films that fit that description. Earlier this year, I would have thought that all was lost, and except for the two beacons of light from the summer, The Dark Knight and WALL-E, it seemed like 2008 wouldn't be remembered for anything else. Although the last few months have produced a slew of good films, the one that will be most remembered in years to come, and looked back upon as a classic, will be The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This movie has it all: humour and drama, strong and deep emotions, harsh sequences and delightful ones, a sweeping, epic romance, quirky characters, thrilling scenes and tranquil ones; the acting is top notch, the directing is flawless, the production value and cinematography are second to none, and the story is one of the best, most unique and delightful of any film this year, delivering a powerful and heartfelt message about the meaning of love and life. David Fincher has long been considered one of the best directors working today, and with Benjamin Button he delivers us the most dramatically and emotionally accomplished film of his career. Brad Pitt, another illustrious individual, also delivers the best work of his remarkable career. All in all, Benjamin Button is the perfect example of an outstanding entertainment, and while I still have a few more films on my list to see, overall I think it's safe for me to say that in my opinion, Benjamin Button is the best film of 2008.",9,2,7,11 January 2009
Transformers," Best entertainment of the summer: Light on the brain, but all in good fun
","Is anything in this movie 'more than meets the eye'? Certainly not. If there's one thing Bay is good at it is delivering the goods up, front-and-center, with no subtleties but also no restraints. Is this necessarily a good thing? Not when he's trying to direct something that is supposed to have any sense of seriousness, such as Pearl Harbour. But on a movie like this, anything goes: I mean, it's about giant alien robots from outer space who have come to do battle on Earth. That pretty much opens almost endless array of doors to Bay's disposal, and of course doesn't leave much room for subtleties. This film's characters are flat but believable; the plot is implausible but not ridiculous. Somehow it all comes together and works in the long run.I give credit to Spielberg, though, for setting the overall tone of the film and ultimately restraining Bay. Quite unlike his previous 'epics' such as Armageddon and The Island, Transformers unfolds with an always-vigorous sense of light-hearted fun and adventure. The film has many cheesy moments, but never does it get preachy nor kitschy, and for Bay to have avoided such obvious opportunities to sneak in that kind of nonsense, I salute the picture and the producers involved that prevented a moment such as Bruce Willis' sacrifice at the climax of Armageddon. This never-serious tone comes across also in the sly and razor-sharp sense of humour, which I thought was absolutely hilarious and worked wonderfully.The acting, quite surprisingly, also worked. Sure, actors like John Turturro and Jon Voight pretty much play caricatures, but the true shocker is Shia LaBeouf, the young up-and-rising star who was too annoying in I Robot and Constantine but who delivers a sharp, witty and very human and believable performance as the young protagonist. His turn in this film quite reassures me of his potential in the upcoming fourth Indiana Jones movie. I expect good things.But this movie has one main central purpose, and I salute it for never once trying to hide it: to entertain and deliver mind-blowing visuals. And it more than exceeds in both of these fields. From the earliest, relentlessly thrilling car chases and all through the final showdown in downtown L.A., this film is a wild, wild ride that grabs you by the collar and never lets you go once. Its speed and pace is impeccable and relentless, and it always keeps you engaged with even more bombastic, even grander, even more insane set pieces and action sequences as it progresses. Bay has of course by now perfected the art of the high-octane action sequence, and with such a broad palette of flashy cars, giant robots, unlimited advanced weapons and the broad, sprawling wide spaces of the American West, Bay, quite unlike some of his counterparts and, dare I say, imitators, knows exactly when to film with intense chaos and when to treat us with a wide, slow-motion long-shot to let us take it all in. In terms of the cinematography and visual style, every shot is flawlessly constructed and gorgeously stylized in terms of lighting, composition, angles and movement. The computer graphic work by ILM is utterly stupefying and probably more convincing than most any other CGI work I've seen lately, as is the excellent sound design by Eric Aadahl, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film nabs an Oscar or two in these categories. And with imagery like a fighter jet flying at full speed only to transform into Starscream in mid-air, grab onto the bottom of a bridge and flip around, landing on his feet on top of it, or a slow-motion shot of Optimus Prime and Megatron literally flying through a high-rise office building, one cant help but sit back and grin.While watching this film, one also can't help but sit back and wonder: what would it be like had Steven Spielberg done more than produce, and perhaps filled in the director's chair as well. What's for sure is that his mark is more than felt on the movie with Bay at the helm: the whole bond between Sam and Bumblebee is strongly present, and scenes such as the one where Sam goes to his house to fetch the glasses while the Autobots wait impatiently in his backyard are pure Spielberg. Would the film necessarily be better? Perhaps, although perhaps Bay was the perfect man for this project with his loud, over-produced and over-the-top approach. But what's for sure is that it would have been very different. I can imagine the family aspect, especially Sam's relationship with his father, far more emphasized, as well as his friendship with Bumblebee, who as the silent visitor from outer space who forms a bond with the protagonist, is an extremely Spielberg-esquire character as it is. Perhaps the military aspect would have also been far less emphasized. It is definitely an interesting thought, but maybe considering the already-ridiculous nature of the plot to begin with, Bay's easy-on-the-brain-feast-for-the-eyes approach is exactly what it needed.It's loud, it's over-done, it's exaggerated and populated with caricatures and flat characters. It lacks any value in plot and characters. But it is irresistibly entertaining and undeniably well-made, far more so than the other big event films prior to it this summer. And its overall light, all-in-the-fun tone really allows one to just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a thrilling, relentless and fantastic ride it is. Ultimately, Spielberg's production along with Bay's visuals match perfectly to create the ultimate brainless summer entertainment.",7,1,3,19 July 2007
Children of Men," A new peak in the cinematic craft
","Children of Men is a new peak in the cinematic craft. I honestly don't know where to begin to describe just how staggeringly, remarkably mind-blowing this film is.First, allow me to express my emotional response to the film. Depression. Elation. Shock. Levity. There are so many emotions I can't even begin to think of how to express in words that I experienced during the film. I was bawling throughout a majority of the length  which makes Children of Men the latest addition to the VERY limited list of films that made me cry. After the film, I sat in my car and just cried my eyes out for 20 minutes before I could even start the engine. It is one of the most emotionally incredible films I've ever seen. I cried from horror, hopelessness, disgust, depression hope, levity, exhilaration, beauty. All these emotions are experienced in their utmost extremes during the film.While they seem so trivial considering just what an emotional impact the boarder picture has, it would still be a crime not to mention the technical wonders of the film. First, the conceptual ones. Nothing can even begin to compare to the level of detail, credibility, logic, and altogether brilliance of the dystopian future portrayed in Children of Men. While it is a popular theory that the human race will eventually be wiped out during an all-out nuclear war, Children of Men portrays an alternate, equally logic and brilliantly ironic end to the human race  we will die out simply from natural causes. The growth in human population has just become such a burden on nature, or God, or whatever forces you wish, and through a mysterious natural phenomenon, the entire human race becomes infertile. But the movie takes this concept and pushes it to such a depressingly horrible extreme, one can't help but admire and marvel the logic while realize the fearful truth  that we're already well on the way to this tragic future the film portrays. In an attempt to find a scapegoat, the gates of Western countries are closed and an ambitious but terrible, horrible governmental campaign sets out to rid these countries of any external influences  foreigners and immigrants are round up, put in refugee camps and eventually deported  if they're lucky. Naturally, subversive resistance groups form and use the only logical tool with which to fight governments  terrorism. It's a bleak vision but one that is far from implausible. The film's crew also meticulously creates all the little details, such as leisure activities, what the outside and the street would look like 20 years in the future, clothes, cars, trinkets, little items, newsreels, mundane routines, and just about anything else you can imagine would look like, be like and work like. It's truly nothing short of remarkable.Another thing that is remarkable is the mind-blowing perfection of the cinematographic craft that materializes in the film. Cuaron creates a combination of down-to-earth hyper-realistic documentary-style film-making, utilizing completely hand-held cameras and long takes in order to simply allow all the details of the world and the setting exist without having to be emphasized; with an extremely self-aware use of colour tone (mainly pale blues and lots of greys) and absolutely gorgeous naturalistic lighting.The actors and director Alfonso Cuaron did a flawless, amazing effort. Clive Owen is intense and absolutely incredible as the protagonist. As with pretty much all of his roles, it is not a showy performances and doesn't feature any of the theatrics many famous lead roles feature  it's a very minimalist ad extremely naturalistic performance, but that's not to say that it isn't intense or emotional  it is abundant in both. With this film, Owen really seals his authority as one of the most credible actors working today.In all, Children of Men is a spectacle to behold. As an entity that exists within the cinematic craft, it's totally incomparable, with some of the best film-making I've seen in any movie, coupled with extremely remarkable direction and an even more remarkable depiction and portrayal of its setting. As a science fiction thriller, it delivers on an indescribable scale: Its concept and the mechanics of its futuristic setting are amazingly well thought-out, and their portrayal is bleak, depressing, shocking and one hundred percent credible and believable. When the film gets tense  and it is extremely tense throughout most of its runtime  it really keeps you right on the edge of your seat, clutching the handle tightly, and has you holding your breath. In the much broader sense, the film is a bleak mirror, or perhaps continuation of the already downward-spiraling current reality in the world today. Parallels between the dynamics of the world throughout its history and the setting of the film are dire and prominent. But all this is just the ribbon that ties the real package  an emotional core, a punch in the stomach so powerful; it is extremely difficult to remain oblivious.",10,10,19,20 October 2006
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Star Wars fandom is dead.
","I saw The Empire Strikes Back for the first time when I was four years old. I barely remember it, only vague images of Yoda hobbling around in a fire-lit hut, talking with a funny voice. In the subsequent years, I discovered that Empire was a sequel, and saw A New Hope and Return of the Jedi as soon as I possibly could. From that moment on, I was hooked. I inhaled Star Wars. I lived it. I had every Hasbro toy, every action figure. I read every expanded universe book, from the Young Jedi Knights books (yes, all of them) all the way through to the epic Heir to the Empire/Thrawn trilogy. I collected the CCG. I had every vehicle, creature and weapons guide book. I played every video game. Star Wars was my life.And what I loved about it was something very specific: It wasn't the legacy of the Skywalker family, it wasn't the minute and specific details about how the force works, it wasn't the mechanics of whatever form of physics exists in the Star Wars universe. It was the universe itself: its people, its imagery, its boundless creativity. Its ability to whisk you away to a world which you could only imagine; taking that world and making it real. THAT is the magic of Star Wars - always has been, and always will be. And I always felt - naively, it seems - that the Star Wars fandom at large loved the property for the same reasons I did.Which brings us to 2017, a year in which a faction of the Star Wars fandom - the same fandom I have so proudly belonged to for so many years, that I built my life around - has decided that a film that DARES to show them something slightly different, marginally unexpected, ever so slightly challenge the status quo of what the universe has been up until this point, is some sort of personal affront, and have made it their mission to destroy it.The negative responses to this film - the level of anger, of vitriol, of pure and vicious hatred - make me sick to my stomach. Look, film criticism is a subjective opinion - if you didn't enjoy something, you didn't enjoy something, and that's fine. If you thought that this film had plot issues, character inconsistencies, bad dialogue, leaps of logic - again, that's totally your prerogative (though I suggest you take a long, hard look back at the original trilogy before you criticize a Star Wars movie of having plot issues, character inconsistencies, bad dialogue, and leaps of logic.)But to think that a film is bad JUST because it defies your expectations? Because it dares to show you something unexpected? Because it commits the horrendous offense of ADDING to the Star Wars lore instead of just re-packaging what already existed and selling it back to you as something new? Because it features strong female characters? Minorities? These opinions range from pathetically short-sighted to outright sexist, racist, and vile.And I've had enough. Because this movie had lightsabers. It had epic space battles. It had beloved original trilogy characters actually growing beyond what they were originally, and opening a door to a new chapter in the saga, while closing the door on their own chapter on the way out. It has engaging and likable new characters. It takes us to new places and shows us sides of the Star Wars universe we have never seen before. And more than anything, more than The Force Awakens and Rogue One that preceded it... it re-captures that feeling of watching the original trilogy, of seeing something totally new and unexpected, of being whisked away to a magical and fantastical place a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.And if that isn't enough for you ungrateful, spiteful, hateful ingrates... I simply don't understand what is. The Star Wars fandom is dead. Because it's just not fun to be a Star Wars fan anymore, if all you get is hate and vitriol and sexism and temper tantrums, and arguments about inane and unimportant minutia, while entirely missing the bigger picture. So, congratulations. You killed the fandom. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.",9,1,5,27 December 2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Visually stunning and brilliantly made
","Oh, what fun it is to see a film that is so delightful in every possible way imaginable. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the new film by Tim Burton, starring Johnny Depp, is the most fun I've had at the cinema this year (so far).I've been a fan of Tim Burton for quite some time now, and he is my favorite film director. I grew up on some of his films, and have seen the rest of them numerous times. With 'Charlie and the Chocolate Facotry', Tim Burton basically combines all of his styles into one film. On the one hand, it contains some really twisted (but ultimately funny) aspects: Willy Wonka's character is hysterically weird. The four other children that enter the factory, excluding Charlie, are completely twisted and vile. Visually, though, it is far more reminiscent to the colorful majesty of Big Fish. And thematically, it is reminiscent of the magical pureness of Edward Scissorhands, while still combining deep and meaningful themes like in Big Fish. Since it combines all of his styles, does this mean that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is Tim Burton's best film? Nearly. I think that Big Fish is better  but only by a little bit.Tim Burton's influence on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of the most prominent aspects of it. The sets are absolutely gorgeous. They are wild, twisted and extremely Burtonesque (Tim Burton is probably the only director alive who has an adjective named after him). From the lopsided set of the Buckets' house, which is very reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands' house, to the wacky, colorful, but twisted set of the Chocolate river room, which is reminiscent of set designs from The Nightmare Before Christmas in terms of color and style, Tim Burton's trademark visual style is at its full force in the film. The movie is so visually rich, that it's a treat just to look at it.Another main attraction of the movie is Johnny Depp, who manages to completely steal the show. Depp has a history of portraying weird and quirky characters, especially in Burton's films (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Ichabod Crane, etcetera), but Willy Wonka drives all of those into the ground in terms of weirdness. Depp has total control of his character, and portrays him brilliantly. Of course, this comes as no surprise  Depp is one of the most versatile and talented actors alive. Johnny Depp has played such a wide variety of characters; I'm convinced that he can play any character he wants. From the crazy, quirky pirate Jack Sparrow to the subtle, human pureness of J. M. Barrie, Johnny Depp is extremely versatile. While it's tempting to say this, Willy Wonka is not based on Michael Jackson. In fact, aside from the fact that they're both pale, I don't see the connection. As Johnny Depp said himself in interviews, Michael Jackson likes children, while Willy Wonka hates them and couldn't care less about them. He said that he based Willy Wonka on a combination of Howard Hughes, Captain Kangaroo, Mister Rogers and various game show hosts from the '60s. Of course, his performance is brilliant.Another star of the film is Danny Elfman, who produces yet another absolutely brilliant musical score. The opening credits theme is sort of a combination of his Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man scores, and is completely brilliant. It totally puts you in the mood of the film, and gives you this little taste of what's to come. But aside from doing the musical score, Danny Elfman also performed the Oompa Loompa songs  including the singing. He sang all of the Oompa Loompa voices, which were later all spliced together. The last time I remember Danny Elfman singing in a movie was in Nightmare Before Christmas  he sang the voice of Jack Skellington. It's good to see (I mean, hear) that he can still do the musical singing.All in all, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a thoroughly entertaining, extremely funny and delightfully magical movie. It is visually stunning and brilliantly made, but it also includes a deep, meaningful message and great character development. Johnny Depp shines in his role, and the directing is top-notch. In my opinion, this film is about as close to perfection as movies get (but it is not perfect), and is the best movie of 2005 so far. Go see this with your parents, grandparents, cousins, movie-buff friends, nephews and nieces everyone can and will enjoy this film.",4,1,2,27 October 2005
Black Snake Moan," Atmosphere, mythology, redemption, blues and a unique vision
","Black Snake Moan is uproarious. It is over-flowingly rich, fantastically orchestrated, strange and cumbersome, unique and visionary. In continuation of Hustle & Flow, Brewer paints his portrait of the American South almost as a mythological land one would expect to see in a Fantasy or Ancient Greece epic. And yet as far high above us his movies hover, they are still rooted; rooted in the deepest, darkest soil there is.As in traditional fairy-tales, Brewer paints his portrait in Black Snake Moan using extremes and exaggerations. Sharp and stark character traits, when coupled with such extreme acts as chaining a half-naked white girl to a radiator in an attempt to redeem her of her sins, exaggerate and emphasize the metaphor the same way such extreme visual techniques such as some characters having colour in Pleasantville strengthened the metaphor in that fairy tale film. But Brewer doesn't begin his film with 'once upon a time'; in this film and also in Hustle & Flow, Brewer presents us with a different fairy tale; a dark, Gothic fable of sex, prostitution, and ultimately, redemption. These themes run through the film's veins like blood and resonate and bloom in its dark, brooding setting.But despite these harsh extremes, Brewer treats his characters like humans, and creates extremely well-executed, three-dimensional characterizations in Lazarus and Rae, particularly emphasized with their relationships with Lazerus' friend at the pharmacy, Angela, and Rae's mother.The acting is, all-around, quite perfect. One gets the feeling that both Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson were born to play these roles. Their characterizations are so intense and so severe; it's even more of a challenge for the actors to keep their heads on and craft realistic characters. And they succeed admirably. Samuel L. Jackson in particular utterly disappears into his character, which serves as a polar opposite to most of the character's he's played before. With films like Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Shaft, and others, he has crafted for himself a typecast of the 'ultimate bad-ass'. In Black Snake Moan Jackson plays an old, broken, defeated and earthy character quite unlike anything he's done before. And frankly, it's just fantastic. What comes as quite a surprise, though, is the casting of Justin Timberlake, and more specifically, the fact that he comes across as quite tolerable. Sure he doesn't have much screen time, but like what Brewer did with Ludicrous in Hustle & Flow, he actually gets Timberlake to act and do what he is meant to do, and not come across as totally unconvincing and irritating.But what is really so incredibly great about the movie is the atmosphere Brewer creates. The rural Southern locations work to his advantage in creating a dark, dirty, grimy, crusty, rugged kind of texture to the entire film, which more than fits in with the film's thematic and metaphorical aspects. And by utilizing all sorts of elements such as the rising sound of cicadas when Rae gets her itch, or a raging thunderstorm that increases and intensifies as Lazarus plays his 'Black Snake Moan' blues number for Rae, Brewer truly manages to create almost a fantasy world, an undermined mythology to the rural Southern setting. And it works so utterly fantastically to craft Brewer's unique vision.And one can't talk about a Craig Brewer film without mentioning the music. In Hustle & Flow, he utilized a soundtrack of down-and-dirty, street-wise hip-hop music to emphasize the atmosphere and the vision. In this film, the music works even better at polishing off and fully representing the unique atmosphere. It is a rural blues soundtrack, but it's the dirtiest, rawest, grittiest blues you've ever heard. And it sounds just absolutely fantastic.In all, it can be said that had this movie been a simple tale of an old, broken, lonely, god-fearing black blues singer redeeming a young white woman who was sexually abused as a child and now suffers from nymphomania, there may have not been very much to write home about. But this film is not about the plot, and not even about the characters, as well as they are crafted in the film regardless. No, this film is about the vision  and what a unique vision it is! It is about the atmosphere, the mythology, the setting. It is about anger, fear, redemption, and most importantly, the blues. And it's all wrapped up in a unique, entertaining, stylized and impeccable ribbon. Brewer has guaranteed himself a spot on the most promising up-and-coming directors list, and with such a solid follow-up to a great debut film, Hustle & Flow, he will definitely be on my radar for future projects.It also must be mentioned that the film has one of the most fantastic and unique titles I've heard yet.",8,2,5,19 July 2007
The Dark Knight," The best superhero movie of all time, but so much more than that
","It's hard for me to refer to this movie in the context of the comic-book superhero movie genre, although it is clearly and by far the single greatest film in it  fact of the matter is, The Dark Knight transcends the genre. Most superhero films contain an inevitable fantasy element  even the other great superhero movies such as Spider-Man 2 or X2 feature a certain fantasy or sci-fi element in them. But with his take on the Batman franchise, director Christopher Nolan and the entire creative team have taken a cognitive and ingenious decision not only to make as realistic a film as possible, but also to actually root their films in the realism of our modern world. In these films there are no superpowers, freak occurrences, unexplained phenomena or fantasy elements of any kind, and any such concept that appeared in fantasy form in previous incarnations of Batman are explained by real-life vindications and abilities in Nolan's Batman films. If anything, the whole realistic setting doesn't make things easier for Nolan but rather harder, because he has to take special care to make sure that nothing bleeds over into the realm of camp. That it works so incredibly well is yet another testament to his talent.From a technical standpoint the film is practically flawless. The cinematography by long-time Nolan collaborator Wally Pfister is absolutely brilliant  camera movements and set-ups are excellent and his use of natural lighting, especially in the many nighttime scenes, gives the film a very stylish feel while remaining completely true to the feeling of realism the film emulates. The action scenes are also incredible  well shot, conceived, and choreographed, it is truly a relief to see the film rely almost entirely on practical effects and stunts and not on CGI. In fact, as far as I could tell the film features barely any CGI, and even the elements that could have only possibly been created by a computer, such as the look of Two-Face, are completely unnoticeably integrated into the film. But what really caught me off guard isn't the technical prowess of the film, but rather that The Dark Knight is fare more than a thick plot, powerful acting, great set pieces, fight scenes, and car chases  it transcends the label of simple entertainment by also serving as, of all things, an allegory.The acting in the film also deserves to be mentioned. Like Batman Begins, Nolan has collected an extremely impressive cast for The Dark Knight, losing wonderful assets such as Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe but gaining equally talented talents in Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal. The crossovers from Batman Begins are excellent as always  both Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, who are undeniably talented actors and who pretty much consistently deliver good performances in their films, seem to have warmed up to their supporting roles, and Christian Bale is excellent and powerful as always in the title role, even if he isn't the main attraction this time around. Gary Oldman, who also appeared in Batman Begins, has a substantially meatier role this time around and is brilliant as always, completely disappearing behind the accent and playing a genuinely, purely good character, quite unlike the antagonistic characters he has played many times before. Aaron Eckhart, one of the most underrated actors who was absolutely brilliant in movies like Erin Brockovich, Conversations with Other Women and Thank You For Smoking (but not so much in The Core and Paycheck), delivers some of his best work yet with the perhaps-too-devoted Harvey Dent, whose obsession with doing the right thing ends up costing him quite a lot. It's a subtle, skillful performance that gets a little showier in the third act but which remains down to earth for the most part. And then, there's Heath Ledger, whose performance is just so incredible, so effective, so unbelievably superior it deserves to be separated from the others. His portrayal of The Joker surpasses everything he's ever done  he is engulfed, swallowed by the raw, animalistic nature of The Joker, allowing it to consume him and his performance.It's easy, and entirely true, to say that The Dark Knight is the best superhero comic-book adaptation movie of all time, but really it's so much more than that. Rooted in reality, the film is more like a really, really good, epic crime-drama that just happens to feature a main character who wears a bat suit and a villain who dresses up like a clown. The movie transcends the comic-book feel and mentality and enters a higher realm. It's technical virtuoso, incredibly well crafted action set pieces, exquisite direction and impeccable acting work well enough, but are elevated when integrated with the film's fascinating, deep, resonant message about human nature and morals. Laden with symbolism and allegorical messages, The Dark Knight is far more than just a superhero movie, and is the best movie of 2008 so far and definitely the best of the summer.",9,2,6,25 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A bit rushed in the third act but still great entertainment
","The Harry Potter series has always excelled at compiling the most exquisite array of high-profile English actors any other film has since Robert Altman's Gosford Park. Indeed many of them appear for so little, the full effect of it all can be felt only when viewing the closing credits. Seeing all those names one after the other made me grin. Indeed the actors that get the biggest chance to shine are Gary Oldman, whose character finally comes in full-fledged force and reaches his dramatic and development peak in this installment. Other actors that get similar opportunities but to a lesser extent are Alan Rickman, who has been in the series since the beginning; and newcomer Imelda Staunton. This role is such a polar opposite to the pure good that was her Oscar-nominated turn in Vera Drake; it certainly shows what superb range the woman has. It must also be said that the three stars, in particular Daniel Radcliffe, have grown and evolved immensely as actors: both in Goblet of Fire and now in Order of the Phoenix the three actors show a wonderful emotional range and knack for drama; they have done what most actors aim to do and that is completely embody their characters. Other very talented cast members that appeared so briefly it was quite a pity were Brendan Gleeson, Emma Thompson, and newcomer Helena Bonham Carter  fans of Marla don't fret; she has a substantially larger role in the 6th installment (unless it is cut in the adaptation, which I certainly hope not). But the biggest misfire is definitely Ralph Fiennes. His appearance in Goblet of Fire was nothing short of a novelty; I was blown away by how he (and the director) managed to take a rather poorly crafted character on Rowling's part and make him into something far more frightening than the embodiment of all evil: They made him human. Fiennes absolutely glowed in Goblet of Fire, but his appearance in this installment was so brief he never quite got his chance to shine and equal his dominance in the fourth film. Hopefully much more will be waiting for him in the seventh book/movie, we'll have to wait until then to see.Which brings me to the film's single, major flaw, the flaw that makes it ever so slightly lesser than the previous two installments. I felt that the ending was unnecessarily and confusingly rushed. I usually hate making book-to-film comparisons as I like to view both as strictly separate entities, but when the film is outbalanced as much as it was in this, I must make the connection. In the book, the sequence in the Department of Mysteries is substantially longer, and rightfully so. As the movie's dramatic peak, one would expect it not to feel so rushed and for the film to take its time, building the tension, so that when the final showdown does arrive, it's impact is far more felt. In the film, it seemed like Dumbledore was duking it out with Voldemort so suddenly, the only thing more sudden was how abruptly it was all over. Looking at the runtime of the film (2 hours and 20 minutes), I really don't see why the filmmakers couldn't have taken the liberty of drawing out the final sequence by about 20 more minutes, to increase the suspense and the drama, and to not have it feel so rushed and just plain under whelming.But there are so many other fields in which to praise the film, one is almost willing to forgive its pacing problems in the third act. If anything can be said about these fantasy franchises it's that they are a designer's dream, and indeed, both the costume and especially the production design in this film have reached a new peak: the production and set design in particular are outstanding and definitely the best in the series, with such absolutely brilliant and gorgeous sets such as the Department of Mysteries or the Ministry of Magic atrium. Like in Goblet of Fire, he special effects and CGI imagery blend seamlessly into the action and drama in the foreground, and creations that would have been considered novelties when the first films came out (such as the cave troll in the first film or Dobby the house elf in the second) are interweaved and integrated wonderfully without ever serving as a distraction and always remaining convincing. Another creator who deserves much praise is composer Nicholas Hooper. While it was sad to see John Williams leave the franchise, it is refreshing to see a composer bring something new to the table: aside from the theme that appears in the beginning and end of the film, the score is an entirely new entity and sound quite unlike anything that has been heard before in the series  this is in total contrast to Patrick Doyle who, in Goblet of Fire, seemingly attempted (and quite feebly so) to imitate John Williams' original score.This is in all a solid film and an excellent entertainment. The Harry Potter series has already elevated itself above the level of simple novelty and entered the territory of full-fledged and strongly rooted mythology, that lets the characters and the actors roam free in its realm. Yates does a solid job directing and everything  from the acting to the score to the production design to the visual effects and CGI  all fits together quite nicely, although the film does acquire somewhat of a hasty limp in its third act, nothing that can't be ironed over in Yates' second jab at the series directing The Half-Blood Prince, slated for release November of next year. Still good, but not quite as good as Prisoner of Azkaban or Goblet of Fire.",7,0,0,20 July 2007
Into the Wild," A long, difficult but satisfying and captivating journey
","I don't like judging actors and filmmakers by their personality. Tom Cruise may be completely insane and his constant pushing of his Scientology agenda can be excruciating, but that doesn't mean that he isn't a fantastic actor and that I won't watch and enjoy hi s movies. So Sean Penn may be sociopathic, and he may push his political agendas too strong, but he's also one of this generation's most intense and talented actors. I haven't seen The Crossing Guard, but Into the Wild certainly proves that Penn is an almost equally talented filmmaker as well.Surprisingly, Penn employs many unorthodox filming techniques and gimmicks characteristic of the much younger post-modern film-making generation of today. From shaky zooms to really creative use of camera angles and positions to jump- and flash-cuts to text scrawling across the screen. Notice how effectively Penn uses cheap-looking video footage to portray Christopher's brief fantasy sequence involving him reuniting with his parents, or Penn's shocking and very risky use of breaking the fourth wall. It is a kind of wild, loose and visceral style of film-making that is used skillfully to portray that kind of no-strings-attached wilderness that the film portrays in the first place.Penn smartly chooses to employ these elements, as they are exactly what his sprawling, epic, lengthy creation needs for variety and to keep his audience captivated. He certainly provides us with a lot to work with  his film is even divided into chapters, like a novel and less like a short and to-the-point story. The story of Christopher McCandless is one of epic proportions: encompassing two I'd imagine very eventful years, even after selecting a common theme to focus on Penn ends up with a movie scraping at a two-and-a-half hour runtime. But while the crux and initiative of the film is the true story of McCandless' fascinating and unbelievable ascent (or descent?) into spiritual freedom by ridding himself of his money and possessions and eventually launching himself into the wild to live completely off of the land, Penn instead chooses to keep the focus on very particular aspects of Christopher's journey, specifically his relations with other people.Indeed the only chapter depicting Christopher completely alone is the final part of his journey on the 'Magic Bus' in the Alaskan wilderness, which Penn splices and intercuts with the chronological series of events that unfolds. The rest of the chapters depict Christopher's encounters with various people and characters along his journey, and although the chapters are named aptly emphasizing the change Christopher undergoes with these encounters, the main feeling we get is just how much Christopher leaves his mark on these people, and not the other way around. He helps mend the hippie couple's love life, he finds a new friend in Wayne, and finally he gives both the optimistically young Tracy and the near-the-end old Ron Franz something to hope for. Even Christopher's parents are drawn closer together by his leaving them behind. What's wonderful is that while Christopher's hokey material-free philosophy may seem immature, naïve and perhaps a bit self-destructive, it is in these scenes where he encounters the various characters along the way that we can see his true selflessness, and it is awe-inspiring. The fact that Christopher's epiphany in his dying moments is that 'happiness isn't real unless shared' just further goes to prove just what a lasting impression these encounters and relationships with various other people are what kept him going.On a more superficial plane, Penn, perhaps employing the immense clout he has around Tinseltown, has assembled an impressive ensemble cast to fill these small supporting roles of the characters Christopher encounters along his journey. From absolutely devastating performances by Oscar winners Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt as Christopher's worried but suffocating parents to intelligent turns from the likes of Vince Vaughn and Catherine Keener, who plays a surprisingly sweet and happy-go-lucky character similar to the one she portrayed in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and which serves as a total opposite to the kind of manipulative femme fatales she usually plays, like her Oscar-nominated turn in Being John Malkovich. Kristen Stewart plays young, naïve and desperate to its fullest extent, and Hal Holbrook gives the opus performance near the end of the film, providing it with a very important emotional axis. But the centerpiece performance is that of Emile Hirsch; embodying McCandless, he manages to perfectly capture his youthful wonder and perhaps even naivety and delivers a performance of immense power and intensity, including startling and gutsy physical transformations surprising for an actor so young. Indeed it seems like just yesterday that Hirsch was underage and starring in teen comedies like The Girl Next Door: I think it's safe to say that not only is Into the Wild Hirsch's unofficial transition to acting maturity, but also that it proves he is one incredibly talented performer.In all, Into the Wild is a long, difficult but ultimately very satisfying and captivating journey. Penn takes us down a long road and populates it with interesting characters and unique, unorthodox film-making techniques. And it's all accompanied by a great soundtrack including wonderful songs by Eddie Vedder that perfectly capture the spirit of the film. It is a unique film that takes many risks, and it all pays off wonderfully. Penn has more than proved his directorial worth.",8,2,5,12 March 2008
Avatar," Predictable story and stock characters do not hamper this unique cinematic experience
","With this film, Cameron has truly pushed the envelope in terms of computer-generated imagery, in ways that special effect companies could only dream of when the first motion-captured computer-generated character, Gollum, hit our screens back in 2002. Avatar features a 40%-60% divide in which a majority of scenes in the film take place in entirely CG-created environments, and I have to say that, objectively, it is absolutely impossible to tell the difference. Whereas so many movies are still struggling with convincing, realistic CGI – computer-generated creatures, animals or other imagery are always painfully obvious to me – it is absolutely stunning to see a film in which the CG-generated imagery is so photo-realistic, laypeople could easily mistake the 12-foot-tall blue aliens featured at the center of the film as really good make-up jobs. The effects team behind the movie has managed to include an unprecedented amount of detail into the CG-created environment and characters that every frame of the film has something fascinating to notice, be it the wrinkles and imperfections in the Na'vi skin to background movements in the deepest reaches of the CG jungle. And the fact that Cameron blocks these scenes just as he would in live-action, utilizing the same camera movements and a surprising amount of 'handheld' photography, makes the effects work even more impressive and convincing. The greatest achievement of the film, though, is definitely the motion capture work. Throughout film history I have only ever encountered two entirely CG-created characters that convinced me so much with their emotions and evoked such a strong emotive connection that I had completely forgotten they were computer-generated: Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the aliens from this year's District 9, specifically Christopher Johnson, Wikus' sidekick. But with Avatar, Cameron has managed to create an entire population of CG-created characters that, with the help of the latest motion capture technology, move, behave and most importantly, convey emotions and facial expressions in an almost eerily realistic way, leagues ahead of the expressionless faces in other motion-capture films. If anything will be said about this film down the line, it will be that it was no less than a groundbreaking technical achievement.What's so great about Avatar, though, is that it isn't just a technical achievement. Anyone could find a way to showcase the latest special effects technology without investing in anything else besides the technology. But Cameron is a storyteller, and he sets out to use these new, groundbreaking techniques to bring the mass audience something they have never seen before. Cameron is no stranger to pushing the envelope in this way: The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Titanic were all groundbreaking films that pushed computer-generated imagery to higher and higher levels; but what made all those films work was the fact that they showed us things we had never seen before. The scale of the Titanic. The mechanics of the Terminators. The expansive underwater world. In Avatar, Cameron and his design crew set out to create a world we have never seen before. I have read a few articles criticizing the art design on the film, from the creatures who are all pretty much weirder counterparts of Earthbound fauna, to the ecosystem which is basically just a larger-scale Earth jungle. While all of this may be true, I still think that the world is so rich, from the Na'vi culture to the look and feel of the alien plants and creatures, to the fascinating secret the planet and the Na'Vi keep which is revealed to be a strikingly clever and interesting concept, that it is absolutely impossible to dismiss it as anything less than breathtaking. And the envelope-pushing special effects and 3-D photography only help to immerse the audience into every detail of this new and incredible world Cameron and crew have created.All this admiration is not to say that the film is not without its flaws. Cameron is very open about the fact that he makes movies catered for mass-audience consumption. What he won't mention and what is also probably his biggest flaw is that he totally underestimates said audience, and writes a script using an over-simplified version of a very familiar premise, stock characters, cheesy dialogue and shameless kitsch thinking that these are the only ways to sell a story to the general public. I think that the box office success of films such as The Dark Knight prove that the mass audience is hungry for meaty, intelligent, deep blockbusters, but Cameron is a romantic and a classicist at heart, and he goes with what's familiar and what he knows will work. The plot of the film, after all, is really just another version of the Dances with Wolves/Pocahontas story but set on an alien world and in the future – ignorant white man is sent out to spy on indigenous culture by infiltrating their numbers, only to fall in love with the values they represent and lead them into battle against his previous comrades. Every plot development is entirely predictable; every element introduced in the first act is so conveniently brought back in the third to help the protagonists. Cameron can't resist including a romantic sub-plot, inspirational speeches, or cheesy and totally kitschy exchanges. He also can't resist making his antagonists so inhumanly evil that they become nothing more than exaggerated caricatures of evil. But I can't deny that I wasn't nonetheless swept away in the epic adventure, and the films visuals are just so rich and so new and so unique and beautiful and mesmerizing and inspiring, and its technical achievements so weighty and grand and important, and the set pieces so effectively put together, so thrilling and sweeping and action-packed, and the performances and motion capture work so pitch-perfect (except for Sam Worthington, who for some reason still just annoys me), that it's impossible not to treat this film like the groundbreaking cinematic event that it is.",8,0,3,26 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," A clever throwback: A good, old-fashioned time at the movies
","Over the past decade, I couldn't help but notice that Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson have been following very similar career paths. Both started out directing zero-budget, hilariously schlocky and highly stylized horror films, eventually upgrading and by the turn of the century directing big-budget studio-produced fantasy films. Jackson lent his unique vision and style to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, while Raimi's Spider-Man films featured a fascinating combination of low-budget horror sentiments and stylistic choices with enormous-budget production values. Now, after he finished his original Spidey trilogy (and before moving on to the upcoming sequels), Raimi went back to his roots and delivered a good, old-fashioned schlocky horror entertainment. And boy does he deliver.Unlike the two Evil Dead sequels, this film isn't a straight-up horror comedy, although it is quite hilarious. It's not a parody, though, and doesn't feature visual gags or jokes or anything like that. But rather, it just features scenes and concepts that are so over-the-top, one can't help but to laugh. In fact, this film can be seen as the exact opposite of 'modern' horror movies: those films push the gritty realism of the situations they depict (even if they are usually nothing more than cheap torture and gore), while in this film, Raimi makes a point to emphasize the mythical, fantasy element and how over-the-top it is. By not taking itself seriously, the film leaves itself room to basically do whatever it wants, and stylistically, it really feels like a throwback to a more old-fashioned style of horror entertainment. It's not even that intense a film – it's rated PG-13, features no nudity or gore (but it does feature a lot of gross-out scenes featuring various insects and liquids) and most of its scares come from its sound design and editing.Speaking of the sound design and editing, the film is a technical wonder. Because it's so stylistically over-the-top, Raimi has the freedom to do what he wants with his camera, and the film features some really well-shot and well-crafted scenes and sequences that greatly intensify its sense of style. Probably the most inspired technical element of the film is its sound, from the brilliant sound design and effects to its pounding musical score which is also one of its biggest throwbacks to an older-fashioned style of film. The performances are also top-notch; good casting choices led to actors who don't phone in their performances but rather invest a lot of effort, both physical and emotional, into their roles, and the results are most noticeable. Alison Lohman particularly stands out, and she's also an underrated favourite of mine so it's great to see her get meaty leading roles like this one. Justin Long can be absolutely hilarious when he wants to so it's still strange for me to see him in completely straight-guy roles such as in Live Free or Die Hard, but it actually works in this film.Ultimately, what makes this film work so well is that it never takes itself seriously. Raimi uses the best stylistic flourishes at his disposal to lend it an atmosphere and feeling of an older and more classic type of horror film, a film that isn't really scary at all (except for a few jump-out-of-your-seat scenes which are just part of the throwback) but one that works on a purely entertaining level as an old-fashioned good time at the movies.",7,2,5,15 October 2009
Invictus," Good and effective, great performances, but generally run-of-the-mill
","For the past decade or so, Clint Eastwood has had one of the most consistently high-quality outputs out of any director working today – and aside from Robert Altman and maybe one or two more earlier in the decade, he is also the oldest one of the bunch. It was an absolute treat to see a director reach the twilight of his career and bloom with the vitality and energy of a young director just getting his big break. Eastwood's films this past decade have been big, potent epics of emotion, from the Shakespearian characters in Mystic River to the down-and-dirty determinists in Million Dollar Baby to the subtle honor of the stars of Letters from Iwo Jima. Eastwood was always so careful in selecting his powerful, dramatic subjects over the past few years – which is why the vanilla-coated glossiness of Invictus seems completely out of place in his oeuvre.The strongest aspect of this film is without a doubt the cast. To Eastwood's credit, subject matter like this – big, epic historical biopics – do usually tend to ham it up when it comes to acting and very often enter the level of theatrics and over-performing. Luckily, Eastwood is at least too smart to fall into that trap, and both lead actors in the film – Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, who actually plays more of a supporting character, but no matter – deliver quite subtle and yet totally effective performances, despite the fact that they are playing larger-than-life characters with real-world counterparts. This renders the performances less bombastic and showy than what has come to be expected from these types of roles – I especially expected Freeman to turn this into one of those 'roles of a lifetime' things – but they are still emotionally powerful and admirably subtle turns from two of our greatest actors, especially Damon who is most effective and one of the most underrated performers working today.As to the film itself, it's not that it's bad in any way; it's a really good and effective drama that depicts an important event in world history and covers a lot of emotional and political ground in a very simple and concise premise. There are some truly powerful scenes – such as the first time Freeman's Nelson Mandela steps onto the Rugby field and is met with a pretty noticeably equal mix of cheers and boos from the crowd. My one real problem with the film is that it takes a very important and complicated political atmosphere – post-Apartheid South Africa and the reconciliation efforts on the part of Nelson Mandela to bring the blacks and the whites together and to unify his country – and just blatantly over-simplifies it and sugarcoats it. And I think that the screenplay is to blame: its lack of harmony and emotional balance is really noticeable. I felt that scenes depicting the racial tension suffered from the 'Crash' effect: put the problems so dead center – and solved them so easily and without too much suffering – that they never really got the heart of it. I also felt that something was a little off in the rugby scenes: Eastwood has shown a newfound energy and vitality in his recent films, but the scenes depicting the rugby games in the film just felt stiff, and lacked the immediacy of better-edited sequences in the likes of Friday Night Lights. To sum it up, I think that when a science fiction film manages to deal far more seriously and deeply with the same themes as an important historical drama such as this one, something is definitely lacking.",7,2,3,26 December 2009
Up," Another masterpiece from Pixar
","Looking back, I can't help but to immediately notice a very interesting pattern in my past movie reviews. This is the third Pixar movie I have written a review for, and this will also be the third consecutive time that I will open the review with the following sentence: Pixar have done it again. Once again, they have proved that no animation studio – and no live action studio either, for that matter – can come anywhere near the sheer and utter quality of their entertainment, purely and simply put. Pixar have proved once again that they can take a concept and premise that doesn't sound particularly attractive at first, and turn it into a masterwork of cinema. They have proved that unlike their animation studio contemporaries, Pixar don't need celebrity voices and characters specifically designed to be packaged and ready for delivery to toy store shelves, and they certainly don't feel the need to patronize their young audience members by injecting into their films jokes that only parents can understand. And they have proved once again that unlike most live-action studio output, it is still possible to create compelling, dramatic and irresistibly entertaining cinema from original screenplays without falling into formulas, clichés or any other kind of compromise for the sake of the audience. In short, Pixar have once again proved that they are the best film studio working today, period.So what makes a Pixar movie tick? What makes this studio's output so consistently better than that of pretty much all the other film studios today, animated or otherwise? I think the answer can be summed up in one simple but crucial word: characters. For Pixar, as for all the great screenwriters both past and present, a film begins and ends with its characters; create compelling and identifiable characters and you can pretty safely bet that an equally compelling story will come along with them. Within the first ten minutes of this film, you know you're in for something different as you see Doctor portray in a completely dialogue-less montage an entire life-long relationship, from the shy childhood beginnings of our protagonist Carl and his soon-to-be-wife Ellie and through their ups and downs, hardships living a complete life together, and finally her eventual death, all the while their childhood dream hovering above them but never quite coming to fruition. It is a heartbreakingly beautiful and poignant sequence, probably the best ten-minute block Pixar have ever created, and while the film does take a slightly different direction from there, it doesn't cease from still bringing up very poignant topics throughout, including hardships of old age, unhealthy obsession, divorce, a child's rejection by his father, and other such resonant, real-life experiences that one wouldn't expect to see in a children's film. Here within lies Pixar's secret, which is additionally exemplified in the story and the humor in their films as well: they don't patronize their young audience members by providing two planes of existence in the film – jokes and plot points for the kids and another set for the adults – but rather, Pixar manage to find the subjects, plot points, visual gags and jokes that both children AND their parents can relate to. For example, I'm nowhere near being a parent yet, but I can imagine this film serving as a very good starting-off point for important parent-child discussions, such as divorce, deteriorating old age of grandparents, and where babies come from.The bottom line is that there is simply no studio quite like Pixar. Only they could represent more genuine human emotion and feelings in a silent, 6-minute short film than any major Hollywood production of the past 10 years (the short preceding the film, 'Partly Cloudy', is one of Pixar's all-time best in my opinion, in terms of hilarity but also in terms of poignant emotional resonance). Only they could take a premise of a man tying helium balloons to his house and flying it to South America and turn it into one of the most dramatic, compelling and irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. Only they could take a film whose protagonists are a grumpy, sour 80-year-old widower and a chubby, 8-year-old obnoxious Asian child and turn it into one of the most massive box office successes of the year. And for that, they deserve all the praise in the world, and them some.",9,2,5,21 August 2009
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The best in the series so far
","The Harry Potter series just gets better and better. The first two movies weren't particularly to my liking, but at least the second one tried to include some darker, more interesting ideas. The third movie was absolutely excellent. The new director truly managed to capture the dark, slightly comic feel I've always expected from the Harry Potter books, but the third movie had some disappointing factors, including a confusing plot, loose ends and plot lines opened by the movie but left open, and weak performances from the kids in what were meant to be very dramatic scenes. The fourth installment, featuring yet another new director (Mike Newell, of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Donnie Brasco' fame,) improves on the disappointing factors that affected the third movie, and is a winner from the start.It seems to me that director Mike Newell has added immensely to the success of the movie. He was able to go under the special effects and grandiose of the movie, and really focus on acting, drama and characters. The acting from the three kids (Daniel Radcliffe  Harry, Emma Watson  Hermione, and Rupert Grint  Ron) has immensely improved since the third movie.Radcliffe, who had some dramatic scenes in 'Azkaban' but who didn't quite manage to nail them, seems to have gained control over drama, and proves in this movie that he indeed can act. Watson, if melodramatic at times, does show great skill in the Yule Ball scenes, combining a sort of pre-teen squishiness and excitement with dark, teenage frustration and overreaction. Grint, though, truly shines among the three, as he gets a chance to show his drama chops, instead of being reduced to merely a source of comic relief (although he does have his share  the scene in which Professor McGonagall teaches the students  especially Ron  how to dance, is priceless. Ron's character has also developed nicely, and I like how they showed his jealousy of Harry in the movie. It was one of the aspects of the book that I particularly liked.Brendan Gleeson brilliantly portrays Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, with such menacing coarseness and brutality; he's practically scarier than Lord Voldemort. Gleeson dominates in the movie.Another newcomer to the series is the brilliant actor Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes' interpretation of Voldemort is nothing short of brilliant. Like the change in Dumbledore's character, the change of Voldemort's character is an aspect of the movie I was very impressed with. The book makes Voldemort out to be the embodiment of all that is evil on Earth, but the movie takes his character to a different level. Fiennes portrays a chilling and dangerous character, but much emphasis is put on the fact that Voldemort is, after all, human. Albeit a bit deformed, he is still human. This humanity that Fiennes and Newell added to Voldemort takes his character to a whole new level, and makes him far more interesting. Instead of just being a dark lord, he has so many more layers beneath him, similar to Darth Vader's complexity and depth. If they continue in this direction in the next movies in the series, it could prove to be very interesting indeed.Many people were complaining that the opening of the movie was 'rushed' and that many of the sub-plots in the book were removed, such as Dobby and Winky, Madame Maxime being a half-giant, and Hagrid's lessons. Well, first of all, I thought that enough sub-plots were removed to keep the movie flowing while still keeping with the spirit of the book, and keeping the focus of the movie on what is truly important in the book. And regarding the opening I actually really liked it. The unbearably fast pace of the first few minutes of the movie takes you totally by surprise and really throws you in to the world of the movie. You get this feeling of 'wait how did we get HERE so quickly?' I didn't think it felt rushed at all. Moreover, I think that enough emphasis was put on what was important in the first 100-or-so pages of the book, and enough was taken out so that it doesn't feel totally jumbled up and hasty. Another one of the major changes, the maze task, didn't bother me at all. I felt it was an interesting alternate adaptation of that task. The maze is so huge; you really lose yourself in it, with feelings of frustration, claustrophobia, and confusion. It's more like a psychological task than a physical one.All in all, with better acting, more character depth and showcasing great emotion and fear in the characters, while still keeping up with the dark realism look featured in 'Azkaban', 'Goblet of Fire' is the best in the Harry Potter series so far, with many memorable scenes and an irresistible human side not seen before in the series. I can only hope that the fifth movie will be good, but so far, things aren't looking too good. But, one must remain optimistic.",8,0,0,3 December 2005
The Fountain," A unique film experience - Incomparable to any other film you've seen
","As I am writing this review I really don't know where to begin. It reminds me of the feeling I had as I left the theatre after the closing credits rolled on the film  absolutely bewildered. I can't even begin to describe the feelings I left the theatre with, but I can safely say that no movie has affected me quite like The Fountain has since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind two years ago (and which is known as my all-time favourite movie). All summaries and attempts to present the plot are futile, because it's truly indescribable. Any summaries you may have read about the plot are null and void  truly, don't judge the film by what it sounds like it will be like. It's a movie you must experience for yourself. And what an experience it is.I find it much simpler to focus on the technical aspects of the film, which are, as expected from director Darren Aronofsky, absolutely incredible. His use of camera angles and movements that repeat themselves throughout the film, such as shots from directly above the action, and extensive use of zoom/dolly outs (an important emulation of the film's message, at least what I perceive it is). The entire colour tone of the film is absolutely gorgeous to observe  a beautiful combination of gold and black colours. Much of the lighting is sharp but in a soft gold colour, which creates a really specific atmosphere. Many scenes in the film take place in a hospital-type setting  the setting you'd normally see in filmed mediums lit with very bright white lighting. Aronofsky lights these scenes with very specific soft golden lights, which place most of the setting in blackness and create an eerie, melancholy atmosphere.Both Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are absolutely phenomenal in their roles, with Weisz particularly standing out, playing her character with what I can only describe as held-back intensity. It's a performance both of subtlety and of passion at the same time. Extra kudos must be given to Ellen Burstyn who delivers an extremely heartwarming and absolutely brilliant supporting performance.The musical score by Clint Mansell is absolutely, completely and utterly gorgeous. It's minimalist (serves as quite a polar opposite to the profoundness of the film itself) but extremely intense. It is a score that perfectly emulates the feeling, emotions and mood of the film. It's the perfect type of score, and the melody itself is extremely appealing to the ear, with extensive and almost exclusive use of string instruments.And of course, the special effects (and when they appear, they are quite prominent) are nothing short of amazing. Just amazing. I have nothing more to add, just see it for yourself and be impressed.But really, one finds it difficult to remove ones mind from the spectacle that is the film. The Fountain is, quite simply, unlike ANY other film I have ever seen. The only movie it even only slightly resembles in terms of vagueness and atmosphere is 2001: A Space Odyssey, although The Fountain is only ever so slightly more down to earth. This isn't to say that it's an imitation of Space Odyssey nor that it has similar things to say, but you do get that feeling while watching The Fountain that you are experiencing something incredibly profound. And profound it is. I never stopped thinking about the film since I saw it last Saturday, and I still don't think that I fully understand everything the film has to offer. But it is absolutely loaded with substance ripe for interpretation. I have recently developed a theory regarding SOME of the themes of the film, but there is still much to decipher. What is important to say is that it is the type of film in which every single shot. Every single editing decision, every single is thought out right down to the last little detail, because it is all these little details that combine to create the broader picture, the profound meaning.The Fountain isn't 'this year's Eternal Sunshine'. It isn't the 'next Space Odyssey', although I can assure you, if you enjoyed either of these two films (and preferably both), you should find much The Fountain that will appeal to you. It's a movie that many people will not like, perhaps even hate. But I was profoundly affected by it. See it. Decide for yourself. It's definitely one incredible film experience.",9,672,899,20 October 2006
The Departed," The man has done it again
","The man has done it again. If there is any director who is the undisputed master of the crime genre, it is Martin Scorsese hands down. Not because his films are campy examples of the genre, and not because they take and break the rules. What makes Scorsese's crime movies, and The Departed as a particular standout example, is how incredibly matter-of-fact they are. Frank Costello isn't a caricature. Jack Nicholson plays him with much intensity, but he never, ever treads Vito Corleone or Marcellus Wallace territory. Costello is just a man who happens to be a foul-mouthed gangster  no more, no less. Costigan is just a young man who is extremely confused about loyalty. Sullivan is just a young man who stands by his loyalty but gets dragged down by his weaknesses. Dignam is a man who compensates for his lacking physical stature with fierce determination. Queenan is a wise father figure. The point of this breakdown is to emphasize that all of these are characters. They never become caricatures, exaggerations, and depictions. They all exist in all three dimensions, round as a billiard ball. As with his previous films, Scorsese never needs to emphasize the setting. Sure, since it is a contemporary film he doesn't need to indulge in period details. But the whole Boston setting is extremely well executed in that Scorsese never emphasizes it. It simply is. It is in this sense that Scorsese is so successful in his film-making. Because he doesn't indulge himself in excessive details. His focus is entirely on his storytelling. And this focus pays off greatly.The plot is thick as a brick. The initial concept of a police mole in the mob and a mob mole in the police department, both of which pretty much need to find themselves, is fascinating and brilliant. But there is so much more than the simple premise. The film is rich with paradoxical details and mind-bending deadlocks. The dynamics, parallels, and general unfolding of events are as rich as they are fascinating. And as the film reaches its unforeseeable climax, we see what all the anticipation was for.From a technical standpoint, Scorsese utilizes a style reminiscent of Taxi Driver. It isn't exactly minimalist, but it is certainly gritty and down to earth. There is no fancy lighting, no elaborate sets or costumes. Everything is extremely realistic and down to earth. Scorsese also expertly uses music in the film, both pop songs and Howard Shore's original score, NEVER to emphasize or warp the audience but simply as a setting. If there are two technical aspects that must be emphasized, it is the cinematography and the editing. Scorsese has always been known as a master of the camera, and what makes him such a master isn't being a show-off, but in his restraint. The camera angles and movements are brilliant and dazzling, without taking front stage. It all serves the story. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, longtime Scorsese collaborator, is definitely the most amazing technical aspect of the film. It blew my mind. I seriously can't think of any director that can better string together a series of shots in a more meaningful and expert way. The editing in this film should win awards. It's just incredible.But utilizing the film medium is just part of Scorsese's brilliance. He is also a notoriously good director of actors. And with an all-star cast most other directors would kill to get, Scorsese already has a great starting point from which his actors can take the dive and start bouncing. And bounce they do. Every performance builds on and off the other performances. Nobody ever overplays anyone else, it's an extremely expert use of an ensemble. This movie further supports the claim that that the Academy should desperately include a 'best ensemble cast performance' category in the Oscars. Nicholson dominates the film; Sheen and Baldwin, the other veterans, expertly deliver fantastic supporting performances. But the real stunners are the younger cast members. DiCaprio was incredible and came across as extremely convincing and very intense as a gritty street character. Then again, Scorsese definitely knows how to direct the man - I still think his performance in The Aviator deserved the Oscar. Mark Wahlberg, a very hit-and-miss actor, is definitely in the hit territory - his aggressive police lieutenant character is expertly, expertly played. But the real standout is Matt Damon. I knew this guy could act - just see Good Will Hunting or The Talented Mr. Ripley for proof. But at THIS caliber? I had no idea he had it in him. The intensity, the drama, the accent - Damon nails it all. He deserves more recognition as a talent and less as a crowd-drawing name as he does today.I resent calling this a 'return to form' for Scorsese, because I personally found his last film, The Aviator, to be just as brilliant as Scorsese's other masterpieces. But this is definitely another entry in one of the most masterful filmographies of any director working today. It's great to see that Scorsese, like fellow director Steven Spielberg and quite unlike fellow directors Brian DePalma and George Lucas, remains a strong and consistent directorial force, and hasn't at all lost his touch. He's still a master of his craft, and does his thing better than anyone else.",9,0,0,28 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Entertaining but dragged down by heavy flaws
","I'll start with the pros: There's no denying it – the movie is irresistibly entertaining. Michael Bay has received much criticism throughout his career, but one thing that must be said is that the man knows how to shoot an action scene. And how to shoot a movie in general – his over-the-top, hyper-stylized style, featuring smooth camera moves, slow motion and lots of sunset photography is among the best and most satisfying in the action genre. The action set pieces featured are wildly entertaining and quite imaginative, and are shot and present exceptionally well, really highlighting and emphasize everything that is purely and totally cool about them. I mean, the film sets out to depict giant robots fighting other giant robots, large-scale action scenes, explosions, destruction and high octane, no-holds-barred action sequences – and it delivers completely on these promises. Many scenes in the film, especially the action-oriented ones, left me sitting with a huge, childish, gleeful grin across my face, and were just as exciting and thrilling and heart-pounding as I could have asked for and then some.Another element of the film that I really liked was the cast. Another example of a film personality getting perhaps more criticism than I think he deserves is Shia LaBeouf; I praised his performance in the first film a couple of years ago, applauding his irresistible and inherently natural charisma, screen presence and ability to superbly combine great comedic chops with more action-oriented feats and even likening him to a young Tom Hanks in terms of his fast-talking, highly energized, hilariously neurotic performance. Well this time around, LaBeouf matches and even surpasses his performance, augmenting the comedic elements with uproarious results while still managing to perfectly deliver the average-guy-turned-action-hero persona. Megan Fox hits her marks and plays her role as eye candy with expert professionalism, and the supporting cast members including John Turturro, Kevin Dunn and Julie White round out the comedic elements to mostly satisfying and quite funny results – although the movie would definitely have benefited greatly had Jonah Hill accepted the role of LaBeouf's college roommate/sidekick.And yet, the film is not without its flaws, and this time around, they are plentiful. After it ended, I realized what that familiar sensation I felt throughout the screening was – the film suffers from the same fundamental flaws as another high-profile sequel from a few years back, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. And it's no wonder when one notices that both films were written by similar screen writing duos. My assessment of the flaws of that 2006 release, especially in relation to its immensely entertaining and hugely satisfying predecessor, are effortlessly applicable to this sequel as well. It all starts with an inexplicable urge to multiply almost every conceivable element from the first film, without realizing that quantity is never preferable to quality. Wanting to outdo and improve upon the previous film in a series is an understandable and agreeable aspiration, but scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman must realize that this does not have to be achieved by bombarding audiences with burgeoned elements from the first film. So sure, some of these multiplications are acceptable: more robots, bigger action scenes, and longer runtime are by no means bad for the film in this case. But what suffers most from the 'quantity over quality' mindset is the plot. Both the first Transformers and to a slightly lesser degree the first Pirates of the Caribbean films benefited from ambitious but relatively straightforward plots, while both sequels suffer from heavily saturated, over-detailed and totally convoluted multiple plot lines that, quite frankly, feel like they were made up as the filmmakers went along. Couple that with some truly dismal lines, some of which derive from the unnecessarily labyrinthine complexity of the plot (such as John Turturro's character exclaiming to himself as he climbs the pyramid, 'That machine will destroy the sun if they turn it on. Not on my watch!' just because by this point audiences are so lost in the plot that they've forgotten what the machine is even there for and why everyone wants to get to it) and some distractingly glaring geographical and continuity errors (the pyramids at Giza and the palace façade at Petra, Jordan are actually hundreds of miles apart, and not adjacent as presented in the movie) and you get a script that ultimately drags the film very heavily down. And the dues ex machine near the end would drive screenplay gurus to suicide.The first Transformers movie was extraordinary stupid: and yet, it so completely succeeded in its admitted aspiration to be a purely, completely enjoyable spectacle and entertainment that delivers everything it promises in terms of robot action and fantastic set pieces while never taking itself seriously, that its ridiculous plot and silly, campy elements were easily ignored and perhaps even complemented it. The plot of Revenge of the Fallen is beyond stupid, but the difference is that while in the first film the brainless plot is ignorable, in the sequel it's actually quite distracting. All these elements are easily comparable to the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and similarly, both franchises took something of a fall in their second films. Like Dead Man's Chest, I felt that Revenge of the Fallen suffered from an overly dense and extremely convoluted plot which not only damaged the quality of the film, but more importantly, failed to retain the novelty, the magical sense of wonder and discovery that the first films in these franchises benefited from so wonderfully. So while this sequel was still immensely and unquestionably entertaining, I still feel that much of what made the first film so utterly enjoyable was lost. And considering the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise's track record, I'm not particularly optimistic about the inevitable third Transformers film to come.",5,1,5,2 July 2009
War of the Worlds," Works on so many levels, highly recommended
","Oh my goodness. This movie took me completely by surprise. I'd seen the trailers, I'm a fan of Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, and yet, I had no idea what I was in for. This is no E.T. This is no Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Here, the aliens aren't lovable, or fascinating, or peaceful. Here they're terrifying, and their goal is very clear: Extermination. Never since Jurassic Park has Steven Spielberg made a movie full of such horror and despair. And compared to War of the Worlds, Jurassic Park is like Finding Neverland.I don't remember the last time a movie had affected me the way War of the Worlds affected me. Ten minutes into the movie I was already tightly grasping the seat handles. Throughout the entire movie, my eyes were wide open, never leaving the screen no matter what. My heart was beating twice as fast as it should. This movie grabbed me and pulled me right in, never letting loose its grip.This is the definition of a 'horror' movie. It doesn't scare you using cheap technical tricks, like having things jump out at you. What happens on the screen in War of the Worlds is just so utterly terrifying that you can't help being scared. This is why I say it's a true 'horror' movie, because you are horrified as you watch the events unfold before you. The film throws its characters into such utter hopelessness and fear; even the viewers can't escape these feelings. While watching the movie, I felt such utter and pure fear; this was a movie-going experience I won't forget that easily. War of the Worlds is probably one of the scariest films I've ever seen.As a 'disaster' film, War of the Worlds works in so many ways that others have failed. First of all, it puts the characters and what they're going through in the center, as opposed to the special effects being the center of the movie, and having everything else built around them. In fact, the camera turns away from the special effects in the movie instead of towards them, to emphasize that the purpose of the movie is for you to identify with what the main characters are going through. The special effects work like supporting effects that are necessary and add to the plot, instead of drawing the attention away from it. Also, the choice of characters is interesting and unique for a disaster film. The main character (portrayed by Tom Cruise) isn't a smart scientist who knows how to save the world from the aliens, nor is he a big hero. In fact, he's quite the opposite. Tom Cruise's character is a loser. He's divorced and his family is in shambles. He can barely take care of his own house, much less his kids, who don't have strong feelings towards him in the first place. His character is one that is trying to be a good father, but just doesn't succeed. The movie throws him and his kids into the terror that's going on around them, and emphasizes what they're going through emotionally, on a personal level, as opposed to emphasizing the grander scale of events (what most disaster movies do). The movie sticks with him and his kids the entire time, and doesn't ever show the larger figures (military leaders, the President of the United States, and other disaster movie clichés). War of the Worlds also avoids the disaster movie cliché of showing world landmarks getting destroyed, which, honestly, is never important to the plot of a disaster movie. It's just cool to watch.The development of the characters is also interesting. Tom Cruise and his kids just have to pull themselves together, and fix their relationship while running away from the alien tripods. As expected from Mr. Spielberg, these dramatic tensions and the character development is done extremely well.Many people were disappointed with the ending. I won't go into details of course, but I will just say that while it did feel a little rushed, the ending really didn't bother me at all, not even the slightest bit. Once the movie slowed down and reached it's final destination, I was still totally exhausted from everything I experienced before. I was about as exhausted as I would be if I were Tom Cruise in the movie, constantly running away from the aliens. This feeling of exhaustion stayed with me well after the movie ended. Only a truly successful movie would affect the viewer like that.The movie, as always expected with Spielberg, is also an amazing technical achievement. The special visual effects are flawless. John Williams' music is haunting. But what truly stood out was the sound. Some of the sound effects used in the movie are just as frightening as the visuals themselves. In one scene, there is complete blackness on the screen, and all you hear are these gut wrenching and extremely loud noises. You can't see, nor do you know what's making them, which makes them even creepier. Another sound effect that stood out was this deep, extremely loud baseline noise that the tripods make, which is absolutely chilling, and just keeps up the terrifying feeling the movie emits.All in all, while it does have flaws, they are minor, and inferior to the total success of everything else in the movie. War of the Worlds works on so many levels: as a summer blockbuster, as a story about the relationships in a broken family, and as a downright terrifying-to-the-bones horror movie. I highly recommend it for anybody who enjoys a good cinematic experience, for whatever reasons. War of the Worlds contains enough elements to entertain any type of moviegoer.",8,1,3,27 October 2005
There Will Be Blood," The best film of 2007; an outright masterpiece, it shook me to the bone
","Before delivering this new opus, Paul Thomas Anderson was already, in my book at least, one of the greatest contemporary filmmakers and certainly one of the best to grow and flourish out of the independent film scene and Sundance Film Festival. His films were unique in their style and scope even though Anderson didn't even try to hide his cinematic references; he openly discussed influences from Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese, and these influences were more than prominent in his films, especially his two oeuvres, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, both of whom characterized with an ensnaring sense of visual style with dizzying, ever-flowing camera-work and featuring broad, multi-character palettes. Punch-Drunk Love was a deviation from his previous films in that its scope was notably smaller, but Anderson's visual style and 'indie' film quirkiness were prominently front-and-center. It seems that the 4-year break since his last film have changed the director, who returns in There Will Be Blood with what is his most mature, epic and self-fulfilling work to date. Stripping himself of his Altman and Scorsese influences, this time around Anderson provides us not with a sprawling mesh of multiple characters or quirky dramas, but rather a singular, monolith character study perhaps most easily comparable to Citizen Kane; There Will Be Blood is, first and foremost, an utterly full and complete dissection of its main character, Daniel Plainview.After viewing the film I tried to imagine another actor portraying the main role, but came out empty handed. Half of what makes the character of Plainview is Daniel Day-Lewis' proficient, spellbinding, grand performance. His turn in this film has prompted me to go back and seek out all of Day-Lewis' previous films in an attempt to take in all of his film roles, and as I see more and more of him it is becoming my opinion that he is the single greatest actor working today, and perhaps who has ever worked. His ability to completely and utterly disappear into his roles; the wide variety of roles he has played  going from a gentle aristocrat in The Age of Innocence to an insane and viciously violent gang boss in Gangs of New York to a real-life quadriplegic artist in My Left Foot. The man is a truly a mystery; reclusive, managing to be perhaps the only actor working today who is selective about his film roles and seemingly refuses to act in something 'just for the money' as many of the great actors have had to do over the years  it's no coincidence that he has done only 12 movies in 20 years; 4 of them in the last 10 years. After Gangs of New York he swore to never act again, instead focusing on his hobby of shoe-making  but I can't seem to express my thankfulness that first his director-wife Rebecca Miller and now Paul Thomas Anderson have managed to coax him back into the profession. His recluse is a curse for movie-lovers, and it is simply unfair to us movie-lovers, not to mention unfortunate, that perhaps the most talented actor of all time denies us his genius. His climactic performance in There Will Be Blood is not only a career best, but is also, in my humble opinion, a top contender for the single greatest film performance of all time.Again deriving from his usual style, Anderson has stripped himself of his extensive troupe of famous regulars and populates his film mostly with unknowns and non-actors, although he does provide us with one more familiar face in the cast, the young Paul Dano. Although the young actor has previously had small, supporting roles in television and some lowbrow movies, last year he wowed us with his poignant turn in Little Miss Sunshine. If that increase in quality projects was any indication, his gripping, powerful turn in There Will Be Blood assures that his career is heading in the right direction. It is an incredibly skillful performance, least of all just because of its impressive ability to riff off of and play against the freight train that is Daniel Day-Lewis. It is a performance that deserves a lot more praise than it gets  people no doubt distracted by Day-Lewis' dominating role, but I'll have Dano know that I'm rooting for him, if that's any consolation.Paul Thomas Anderson never ceases to amaze me. Two of his previous four movies are, in my opinion, unprecedented masterpieces, both have garnered 10/10 ratings from me, and both are very high up on my top 100 movies list. I thought that contemporary cinema couldn't get much better than Boogie Nights and Magnolia. But Anderson has succeeded in proving his true worth by delivering something that is at once entirely different from his previous two masterpieces but also an unparalleled modern masterpiece of its own. I feel torn because after viewing this year's other neo-Western masterpiece, No Country for Old Men, I was sure that this was the Coen Brothers' year, but after being absolutely blown away by Anderson's opus, my initial opinion is challenged. Masterpiece doesn't even seem fitting enough a word for this unbelievable, indescribable work. Anderson creates such thrilling scenes that my heart was frantically pounding throughout most of the film, reaching a peak in one of the most absolutely, downright incredible scenes in recent motion picture history, the now infamous bowling alley scene. This movie literally blew me away; it shook me to the bone. With There Will Be Blood, Anderson has crafted a technical, directorial and thematic masterwork, reinforced by an inexpressibly remarkable performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, and delivers the best movie of 2007 and one of the single greatest modern classics of contemporary cinema.",10,3,14,17 February 2008
American Gangster," A morality tale epic battle of wits between two titans
","One of the oldest film genres, the gangster film used to be populated with small, minute-scaled personal stories of redemption or personal achievement. But in the 1970's this genre quickly evolved, in particular with the help of directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, into a genre identified with broad, sprawling epic depictions of loyalty, family, and rise-and-fall tales: the gangster epic. Directly continuing this grand cinematic tradition, Ridley Scott delivers a fantastic work or extensive, grand proportions in all the possible aspects of film-making technique, cinematographic craft, and historical precision.Steven Zaillian, the man who penned Schindler's List and Gangs of New York, delivers a broad, sprawling and wonderful screenplay more than fitting of the word 'epic'. Zaillian provides us with a cornucopia of details concerning everything from Frank Lucas' rise to power, his work methods and his relations both with his family and with other gangsters; and on the other end of the spectrum, Richie Roberts' work ethics, relations with co-workers, eventual assignment to take down the drug kingpins, and all this coupled with his own personal problems and family life. We see the rise, the stay at the top, the fall, the aftermath, and everything in-between, and are spared no historical or fascinating detail whatsoever. That said, the script does have one major weakness: I feel Zaillian could have summarized the aftermath a little more than it ended up taking. But while the script certainly is meant to serve as a giant, broad magnifying glass to this particular period in American crime history  and certainly more than delivers on this historical plane  it's very hard to miss what Zaillian was truly aiming at here, and that is the facing off of two titanic forces of nature.What is most fascinating about how Zaillian chooses to portray his two main subjects is not only how negated they are, but also the nature of these negatives. Frank Lucas, the drug kingpin who kills at will and who is single-handedly responsible for the cheap distribution of illegal and highly deadly drugs on the streets, is shown as a charming, relentless family man whose first and foremost order of business is providing his mother and brothers with a large estate to make sure they are set for life; he arranges meetings for his talented nephew with heads of baseball teams, he is faithful to his wife, he goes to church every Sunday with his mother, and he generally works his hardest at constantly keeping his cool. Detective Richie Roberts, on the other hand, is an undeniable good soul; a recurrently mentioned point in his career is that he found $1 million in untraceable dollars in the trunk of a car and turned it in. He is the laughing stock of the entire police force for being straight as an arrow and entirely honest, and his devotion in the taking down of first Lucas and eventually the crooked NYC police force is truly inspirational. But Richie is divorced, he skips out on the sparse meetings he has with his kid, he is a womanizer and we know that he cheated on his wife and engages in casual sex; he is a lonely recluse who takes night courses and always seems to be preoccupied with something else. Judging by their characters, you'd think that Lucas would be the one to root for, and indeed this negation, this battle of the wits, is the centerpiece of the epic drama.And who better to play two opposing titan forces than two of the undeniably most titanic actors of our generation, Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington. Crowe's performance is pitch-perfect and he effortlessly embodies Richie's every trait, from his indecisiveness and preoccupied nature to his blind devotion and honesty to his flawless accent. And yet, he is indisputably overshadowed by Denzel Washington's powerhouse performance as the charming, murderous family-man drug kingpin Lucas, who he plays with an almost animal ferocity that comes so incredibly naturally to him. The supporting cast also features some familiar faces that deserve a little more time in the spotlight than they currently have, namely Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Lucas' brother who gets a little too caught up in the luxurious life Lucas provides him and who continues to deliver fantastic roles in the movies he acts in, both as a supporting and as a lead player; and Josh Brolin, who plays the corrupt cop with such dirty sleaze-bagginess that he can truly be viewed as the film's one true villain and who must have been in more high-profile movies in 2007 alone more than he has been in during the rest of his entire career beforehand.I have noticed that many movies in 2007 are morality tales: the good guys have their many flaws and weaknesses emphasized while the bad guys are portrayed as likable, admirable persons despite their actions. Ridley Scott, undeniably one of our greatest working directors, delivers a fantastic entry into the crime epic genre that works both as a stunning and brilliant cinematic achievement, as a historic depiction of crime history, as a rise-and-fall story, and as a morality tale epic battle of wits between two titans. One is only left to regret the fact that Ridley Scott didn't shoot this epic in all of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio glory his films are usually identified with.",8,0,2,7 December 2007
The Reader," Subtle and restrained, holding a little too much back; amazing performance from Winslet
","There's no doubt about it  where American drama film-making is often very in your face, obvious and insistent, British film-making is far closer to the European faction in its elegant, delicate subtlety. The Reader is one such example of this impeccable English film-making, and benefits from the best England has to offer: Director Stephen Daldry, who was a long-time theatre director before moving to motion pictures recently, and who has previously directed two excellent films  the under-appreciated underdog story Billy Elliot, and the even more underrated cinematic masterpiece that is The Hours; screenwriter Sir David Hare, also a long-time theatre professional, in this case a playwright; Roger Deakins, who is one of if not the best cinematographer working today; and at least two of the best acting talents Britain has to offer, Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes. Literally nothing in the film is blunt: ideas and themes in David Hare's screenplay are very subdued and under-the-radar, the acting is not bombastic and melodramatic but rather restrained and calculated, the cinematography serves its purpose but for the most part doesn't particularly stand out (Deakins, who won an Oscar nomination for his work on the film, should have been nominated for either of the other two films he shot this year, Revolutionary Road or Doubt), and in all, I actually felt that it was this subtlety and restraint that really held the source material back from true greatness.That said, the film does contain many elements that come together marvelously, starting out from the screenplay. Like another excellent script from 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Reader's almost extreme and radical subtlety dictates that none of its rich, resonant, powerful themes burst out of its seams, but rather remain bubbling right under the surface. Many critical viewers unfortunately interpret this gentle, restrained subtlety and nuance as 'lack of content' and 'emotional coldness', but I actually felt that this was one of the film's greatest assets. From a distance, it may seem to the simple-minded that the film is about the Holocaust and the horrors that occurred in it, but that couldn't be further from the point. As evident in a very short and easy-to-miss scene near the beginning of the film, the true underlying message of the movie is about the dark nature of secrets, and the fact that sometimes, in order to keep secret something that we are ashamed of, we end up doing far more atrocious things than those that we are trying to hide. This message can easily be applicable to the Holocaust, in that because of the German people's shame that they let an atrocity of this magnitude happen on their watch, they didn't do anything to stop it in time. Then again, the message could also be applied on a personal, human level as well, and it is this universality that lends it even more weight and relevance.In addition to the inherently rich screenplay, the film is also carried and elevated by its performances. At the center, and also rightfully attracting the most attention, is Kate Winslet's simply riveting, intricate and quietly heartbreaking performance. It's one of the finest acting moments of her undeniably illustrious career  Winslet is my favourite actress of all time and I don't think she has ever delivered a bad or even a mediocre performance; that said, this is definitely one of her shining moments, and aside from sporting an excellent German accent, Winslet demonstrates an incredible ability to embody her character, who is so caught up in her own shame, both for things she had no say in but also for atrocities that she participated in by choice that she has become a closed shell, hiding all of her feelings behind a pale sheet of glass, although she lets just enough of them seep through her eyes to give us a hint of what's bottled up inside. It is easily one of the best performances of the year. Also worth mentioning are the two actors portraying the young and old versions of the protagonist Michael Berg, David Kross (young) and Ralph Fiennes (old), both of who deliver stellar performances for entirely different reasons. Kross is wonderful in showing the transition from the youthful, lively, passionate Kross to the jaded, introverted and emotionally distant Kross, emotionally damaged by his unrequited love for Winslet's character, Hannah Schmitz, who one day just disappeared after their whirlwind affair one Summer. And Ralph Fiennes is remarkable in his portrayal of the older version of Berg, by now completely world-weary, isolated from everyone around him and emotionally cold and dysfunctional. It is another one of Fiennes' immaculately subtle performances that, although thoroughly excellent goes completely unnoticed by awards circles.The Reader is a good film, but not a great one. It's subtlety and restraint both in its screenplay and in its performances is terrific, but ultimately I felt that the film may have held too much back, keeping us not quite riveted by the plot or characters, as intricate as they are, but rather more objectively but distantly interested. Although a definite beneficiary from excellent performances, in particular Kate Winslet's enthralling, haunting portrayal, The Reader is also somewhat lacking in its more technical aspects, and while a good, entertaining and interesting film, I can think of at least five other films from 2008 more worthy of the coveted Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards than The Reader.",7,1,1,24 January 2009
The Wrestler," Aronofsky's most mature and complete work yet; tragic and harrowing
","It's about as stripped-down a you can get with movies: Unlike his previous three films, Aronofsky forfeits his unique visual abilities and tells his story with an extremely subtle, very realistic and naturalistic visual style, featuring hand-held cinematography, on-location photography, natural lighting, and beautiful hand-held tracking shots following his protagonist around, utilizing some brilliant jump-cut editing to keep the pace flowing along. Clint Mansell, who composed two of my all-time favourite film scores, for Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain, both of which were very distinctly dramatic, also takes it down a notch and delivers in The Wrestler a beautiful, subtle but haunting accompanying score.The plot of the film is also a notch down from Aronofsky's previously much broader strokes. Unlike the ensemble experiences in Requiem for a Dream or the epic, time-bending undying love story of The Fountain, The Wrestler tells a very simple story about one central character. But in this case, we have a very prominent example of quality over quantity, and although the story focuses on just one character and not much really happens in it, it is still one of the most powerful, dramatic, resonant and deep and profound stories told in any film this year. I think (and hope) that The Wrestler will go down as one of the great cinematic character studies; the original screenplay by Robert D. Siegel is by far one of the best, most resonant and powerful screenplays of the year, in which he delivers to us an encompassing, comprehensive, in-depth portrayal of one of the most tragic cinematic figures ever to grace the screen.The Wrestler shows us a character, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, who has burned every bridge in his life, and even though he eventually realizes that his life has been a long streak of mistakes, it's already too late to actually take control of things and make a profound change. Randy was a pro-wrestler in the 1980's, but after going past his prime and washing up, the inevitable result of his chosen profession, Robinson realizes that he actually has nothing else going for him in his life. It's sad to see this man, once at the top of his game, locked out of his trailer because he can't pay his rent, work at a deli counter at the supermarket; selling cheap memorabilia, old video cassettes of his fights and signatures in empty civic halls and high school gymnasiums, every once in a while signing an autograph or taking a Polaroid but most of the time sitting behind his fold-out table and looking around at the other wash-ups and has-beens; and participating in tiny, underground, independent wrestling competitions in front of crowds of no more than a few dozen people. Robinson tries to mend his broken relationship with his daughter and fails; he tries to create a meaningful relationship with his favourite stripper and fails; he tries to rehabilitate himself, retire from wrestling and take on a normal job, but eventually he comes to the realization that he has nothing left but his small legion of followers who, like him, can't let go of the past. It's a bleak, bleak story and it is sad and unavoidably tragic and depressing to watch Robinson's unstoppable downward spiral, but it is this very bar-none, no-restraint approach that makes the movie so incredibly good and worthwhile.At the center of this Shakespearian tragedy is one central performance, the pillar of life in the film and its one aspect that has been garnering the most attention. Mickey Rourke has been receiving a seemingly endless slew of accolades and mentions for his performance in the film, and I must say that it is all justified. I find it hard to categorize this as Rourke's best performance, mainly because the man has never really had the most illustrious of film careers: sure, he was entertaining in various fun supporting roles in all sorts of movies over the years, but Rourke has never received and probably will never receive again a roll of such profundity and depth. Rourke's performance truly is phenomenal: like the method greats, he draws from his past experiences of being a washed-up professional boxer, and really pours every drop of visceral emotion into his performance: It's a stunning, amazing, impressive spectacle, and a performance for the ages.With The Wrestler, Darren Aronofsky, easily one of the most interesting, talented and brilliant directors young directors working today, has delivered his most mature and complete work yet. A film with irresistible subtlety, in The Wrestler Aronofsky tones everything down, letting the profound, visceral drama speak for itself. It's a bleak, depressing tragedy, and this is certainly not a happy movie; a comprehensive character study of the largest scale, showing us a tragic, broken figure portrayed by Mickey Rourke in one of the most compelling acting achievements this year.",9,1,3,11 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An impressive and glorious end
","George Lucas has finally proved himself worthy of the legacy of 'Star Wars'. With Revenge of the Sith, Mr. Lucas has proved that he can actually direct a great movie. Revenge of the Sith manages to successfully and satisfyingly close the Star Wars circle. The saga is finally complete.Many Star Wars fans (myself included) were disappointed with George Lucas when he made the first two prequels, Episode I: The Phantom Menace and Episode II: Attack of the Clones. We felt that he ruined the charm and the magic of the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, and VI; A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi respectively). While nobody really goes to Star Wars to see great acting, the acting in the prequels (especially by those who played Anakin: Jake Lloyd in Phantom Menace and Hayden Christensen in Attack of the Clones, and also by Natalie Portman, who played Padme) was below any real level of tolerance. The fact that Natalie Portman is normally a good actress proves that the problem with the prequels was the director, and not the actors. The script was uneven, and George's pathetic attempt at writing romantic scenes in Attack of the Clones was so pathetic it was embarrassing. George also ruined some favorite Star Wars lore: The Force became a scientific matter (Medichlorians), and R2-D2 and C-3P0 became the sources of comic relief, thus completely ruining their characters. C-3P0's one-liners in Attack of the Clones were so bad it hurt. We all asked ourselves, 'What was George thinking?' Well, with Revenge of the Sith, we understand that George asked himself the exact same thing.Revenge of the Sith is so much better than the previous two prequels it's amazing. Everything in it is better. I'll start with the least important: the special effects. The opening shot of the movie totally blew me away. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Many people complained about the way the CGI Yoda looked in Attack of the Clones, and I also thought that he wasn't a really amazing achievement in CGI. In Revenge of the Sith, the animators have clearly taken some more classes, and Yoda looks perfect. Who would have thought that a 2-foot-high green CGI character could look so believable? And he really does. The character of General Grievous is brilliantly executed. If you're a special effects fan, prepare to be completely blown away. What's so overwhelming about this, though, is that while the movie is built with the special effects, it doesn't rely on them, it's not built around them. They are used as tools to create the visuals of the Star Wars universe. They are second to the plot, and to the drama. And that's one of the reasons that Revenge of the Sith is so successful.The acting has improved by far. Natalie Portman finally proves to all Star Wars fans that she can, in fact, act. And she acts wonderfully in this movie. The true shining star, though, is Ian McDiarmid, who plays Palpatine powerfully, with ruthless supremacy bordering insanity.The film's single, biggest flaw is the casting of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker. Episode II was too flawed to really notice Hayden's bad acting, but in Episode III it stands out, and really drags the film down. This is especially unfortunate because of the intensity of the film and his character  intensity that is brought down because of his acting.The true crowning achievement of Revenge of the Sith, though, is the drama. It sounds strange saying this, but Revenge of the Sith is actually emotional. I was totally engaged in the drama. It's not all drama, though, there's plenty of action, but the scenes with the Jedi, especially with Palpatine or Anakin and Obi-Wan are really tense and powerful. The emotion in this film is something that hasn't been seen in Star Wars since the dramatic scenes between Luke and Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. Their intensity can definitely be compared to those very scenes. Anakin's decline towards the dark side is portrayed so brilliantly and dramatically, that you really feel for him, feel his and his loved ones' pain. Star Wars once again becomes a true cinematic experience, and not just a bunch of special effects.And despite the drama, there still is some of that good old Star Wars fun. The difference is, that with this movie George isn't (painfully) trying to create 'cool' things on the screen. Yoda fighting Count Dooku in Attack of the Clones wasn't really important (after all, the fight ended quickly, and unresolved). It was put in just because George knew that people would think that seeing Yoda fighting would be 'cool'. The same goes for R2-D2 flying with the jets on his legs. In Revenge of the Sith, George doesn't show any of these things only because of their entertainment value. Yoda fights because he's fighting for his life. R2-D2 uses his jet packs as a tool, not as a way to show off his 'coolness'. It seems that George's attitude towards the film has completely changed from his attitude towards the other two prequels.Any Star Wars fan (and hopefully, that's all of you) will be delighted while (and after) watching the film, because of all the reasons mentioned above, but also because it's such a thrill watching as all the loose ends are tied, and all the pieces of the puzzle fit in perfectly with the beginning of the original trilogy, starting from Episode IV.All in all, Star Wars Episode III is a total success from George Lucas, who managed to end the saga with an impressive and glorious bang. And if you manage to look over the feeble dialog and the wooden acting, you'll see that it's actually a really good movie.",4,4,7,27 October 2005
WALL·E," A crowning cinematic achievement
","First off, the animation itself is absolutely stunning. Pixar have perfected the craft of recreating realistic live-action photography in animation. Depth of field, out of focus objects, zooms  the look is spot-on. The animators also employ a wonderful colour palette, with enough variety and richness to keep things colourful and lively but also remaining very much rooted in reality. But really, the animators won me over right off the bat when, looking closely, I noticed tiny specs of dust floating around in the air during the opening scenes set around the garbage skyscrapers. With such a devoted attention to detail to make everything as realistic as possible, it's no surprise that Pixar are the leading studio for computer-animated films.But the truly incredible feat the film achieves in its animation is character design and animation. Going back to the traditions of Disney, the animators faced a tough challenge, which was giving characters emotion using as little gestures as possible. In this case, our protagonist is a box-shaped robot with treads and binoculars for eyes. But the amount of emotion and character this little box emanates is an astonishing testament to the animators: he's not just a cute-looking little robot, but a cute-looking little robot with a personality. Right from the opening shots of the film we are won over by WALL·E's cuteness and irresistible charm. He brings a little lunchbox with him to work in which he collects all sorts of trinkets and treasures from the endless sea of garbage covering our planet. He treads indifferently past a graveyard of hundreds of long-deactivated WALL·E units  the last of his kind. At home, it's his little pastimes that keep him happy: adding today's lunchbox content to the revolving shelves containing all his treasures, spending time with his little cockroach friend, watching his favourite movie, 'Hello, Dolly!', on his iPod  after 700 years, imagine how many times he must have seen it.The film's true emotional punch, though, arrives along with its second main character, the heavenly robot EVE, who looks pretty much like something Apple would design 700 years in the future. On paper, two robots falling in love is a concept that shouldn't possibly work. It's quite mind-boggling then, and an incredible testament to director Andrew Stanton and the entire creative team really, that it works so exceptionally well in the film. It is difficult to use terms like this when it comes to robot characters, but the amount of human emotion displayed in this film is astonishing. If WALL·E wasn't cute enough based solely on his trinket-collecting antics, his robotic perfectionism and his film appreciation, then his shaky, nervous falling-in-love with EVE is absolutely heart melting. He's neurotic and shy and at first EVE doesn't seem to notice him, but eventually he wins her over and magic begins. I was nearing tears in the scene where WALL·E takes EVE home and excitedly shows her all of the things he's collected, climaxing with his rendition of a musical dance scene from 'Hello, Dolly!' using a garbage can lid as a top hat  I just couldn't handle it, it was beguilingly adorable. Indeed, the risks and sacrifices these characters are willing to make for one another in the name of love are on such an epic scale, this film may go down in history as one of the great Romantic films.Then, there is the film's sci-fi aspect, underneath which hides a very strong cautionary message. The sci-fi concept of the formation of one giant corporation, which tailors to all of mankind's needs and services, eventually getting all of mankind on a perpetual vacation in a massive interstellar cruise ship while at the same time continuing the environmental destruction of our planet to the point where return to Earth is impossible, is very original and quite fascinating on its own. It certainly serves as an interesting contrast and a fresh approach to the usual dystopian, post-apocalyptic depiction of Earth we've been used to seeing lately. I loved how the movie didn't shove its environmental message down the audience's throats, but rather simply displayed a possible outcome of this path we are slowly going down without directly portraying that our current environmental conduct is what led to it.For many reasons, WALL·E is a crowning cinematic achievement and the peak of Pixar's output so far. It's entertaining, thrilling, tense and of course absolutely hilarious. It is a technological wonder and a landmark achievement in animation. It provides us with both food for the mind, with its powerful environmental, future of mankind message; and food for the heart, with its touching, charming, wondrous, beautiful story of two very different robots falling in love. The emotion, the characters, the drama, the humour, the technical execution  WALL·E excels in every possible field. And that it is animated, a genre in which producing shallow, simple material is extremely easy, makes it all the more special.",9,2,4,13 July 2008
The Queen," An expert work of aesthetic and subtlety
","Stephen Frears is an interesting director. His work is about as varied as it gets  grand period dramas set in England (Dangerous Liaisons), romantic comedies set in Chicago (High Fidelity), and everything in between. The Queen is another interesting addition to his directorial resume, a resume filled with films that all have one thing in common: subtlety.The Queen isn't a subtle film per se, as its core conflict - the conflict of interests between Tony Blair, connected to the people, and Queen Elizabeth II, standing firmly by the royal protocol as expected of her  is prominent and obvious. The Queen's minor transformation is featured prominently and not hidden; it is not a film wallowing in secrecy and uncertainty. But it is a film that is directed with subtlety. Frears' camera is gentle, keeping still and always with his characters. Its movements are smooth and delicate, and nothing in the movie is ever sharp, angular or askew in any way. It is all very straight and formal and clean  and what better subject matter to fit such aesthetics but the workings of the Royal family itself.Similar to Capote last year, The Queen is a good but not extremely special film whose main performance elevates it to a great film with something unique to offer. Again, this isn't to say that The Queen is a bad film, or even an uninteresting one  But it doesn't really have much to say aside from being a portrayal of the events in question. It also doesn't have much of a story exactly, but is rather an exact and in depth portrayal of events. The unfolding of events is interesting, but not particularly engaging as it is all very matter of fact. Luckily for the audience Michael Sheen portrays Tony Blair  shy grin and casual nature  in an extremely sympathetic way so the audience connects to him as our guide through this unfolding of events. But truly, it is Helen Mirren's performance that stands out above all other aspects of this film. And what a performance it is.The first and foremost characteristic of The Queen is her restraint; she guards her emotions behind a stone-hard face, is always polite and gentle, speaks in always homely but never revealing tones, and in all is just a façade of graciousness and good manners. That Mirren emulates these aspects of the Queen's character even in the more intimate, behind-the-scenes events involving her family and close associates is impressive enough; but what makes her performance truly stand out are her reactions to these devastating events. Mirren lets just enough emotion slip through her Queen's stoic face to let the audience know how she feels, but while still exercising the restraint the character, the real Queen, would exercise. It's a performance that is never showy but always dominant, and one worth every admiration possible to give.What is further interesting about the performance is how the film seemingly assembles itself around it. Frears' restrained, quiet, delicate direction is no coincidence  it's a further extension of the Queen's own manners and behaviour. In the best scene in the entire film, we the audience are treated with an intimated moment with the Queen  it is the only scene in which she is alone, only the audience with her. She begins to sob: there are no other sounds, no other distractions, and even further than that  Frears has her with her back to the camera. What humbleness and modesty the Queen portrays at all moments  even hiding her feelings and intimacy when she is alone.",8,0,0,25 January 2007
Iron Man," Features signs of greatness that make X2 and Batman Begins as good as they are
","Between the winter and summer a little switch goes off in my head, and I move between two schools of film-making and film appreciation. Six months ago, I couldn't be less interested in big-budget glory fests. I judged the movies I saw in theatres  movies like No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and Atonement  with the sharpest of critical eyes; the slightest detail out of place would have thrown me off completely. But now, in the upcoming summer months and eagerly awaiting releases such as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and The Dark Knight, my eye is different. I see a movie like Iron Man and don't care that it is almost entirely disconnected from anything remotely realistic. I don't care that it portrays Afghani terrorists as caricatures operating in backwater, undeveloped, ridiculously improbable cave networks. I don't care that there is a character named Pepper Potts. In the upcoming months, all I want is to sit back and enjoy the ride. And if these films have a little something more to offer, then all the better.As I previously mentioned, Iron Man does slightly dab into moments of elated poignancy. Some aspects of it do serve as a very contemporary reminder of the current status of world politics, especially in terms of weapons distribution and military support in foreign countries, coming back at us like a boomerang. In this sense, Iron Man is almost like a comic book version of Charlie Wilson's War. In addition, the filmmakers and the extraordinary Robert Downey, Jr. do a fantastic job in creating an interesting, well-rounded and satisfyingly flawed protagonist. But for the most part, it's just, plain and simple, a really good show. Visual effects are top-notch and seamless; the action scenes are thrilling; the theatre's surround sound system was working overtime, and in all I have to admit that the two-hour runtime felt like a lot less.Jon Favreau, famed actor, has had slight experience in directing but nothing nearly as large-scale as this so as to indicate that he was even capable of pulling it off. Well, he does indeed manage to pull it off, and quite will at that. The film looks stunning, the scenes are directed and choreographed exquisitely well, and in all Favreau manages to create a very strong balance between big-budget action comic book movie sentiments along with more smaller-scale techniques more in vain with Favreau's breakthrough role in Swingers. And most of this is thanks to the one, the only Robert Downey, Jr.Downey, Jr. is the kind of actor who can almost sleepwalk through a role. Like the greats such as Daniel Day-Lewis or Al Pacino, acting and charisma seems to be an utterly and totally natural thing for him. With roles as varied as a book editor, a crazed drug addict, Charlie Chaplin and now a multi-billionaire playboy turned super hero, Downey Jr. still manages to apply his unique and personal fast-talking, rapid-fire, neurotic, cynical acting style in everything he does. I guess he's just lucky to always get to work with directors who let him cut loose and do his thing. This film is no exception  many scenes involving Downey, Jr. with rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue seem like straight out of a Robert Altman movie and totally improvised. What is so great about the performance is that Downey, Jr. combines this trademark acting style with a really impressive sensibility and connection to the more comic book action-movie-oriented aspects of the role. Every single frame he is in becomes all the more worthwhile and entertaining; it's just a fun, great, funny, well-rounded performance that proves once and for all  if roles in other smaller recent films such as Good Night and Good Luck, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly and Zodiac didn't quite break it to the mainstream sentiment  that Robert Downey, Jr. is back.The cream of the crop of super hero movies are the ones not only featuring strong, rounded, interesting characters from the original comics but are also films in which the filmmakers take special care to place action in a familiar, as-realistic-as-possible setting, providing not only interesting characters but also believable settings for us to identify with them in. The single best comic book adaptation movie of all time is for me a three-way tie between Spider-Man 2, X2: X-Men United and Batman Begins. Other impressive efforts include the first Spider-Man and X-Men films as well as Tim Burton's non-realistic but uniquely stylized versions of Batman, and also Richard Donner's old Superman movie. And the more lousy, effort-less super hero movies come out  such as Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Ghost Rider and many others  the more the quality of the good ones is emphasized. Iron Man contains bits and pieces of what makes a movie like Batman Begins so good, but also many bits of guilty pleasure over-the-top fantasy that are entertaining but quite silly and unbelievable. That said, Favreau and crew are definitely on the right track, and while Iron Man was a good introduction, I'm hoping that the sequel will take everything that was good about this first film and amplify and further develop these points. A darker, more flawed exploration of Tony Stark's character is always welcome, and with Robert Downey Jr. on board, it's almost a guarantee to up the ante, similar to the X-Men and Spider-Man sequels. Here's hoping for the best.",8,1,2,9 May 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Disappointingly daft and clichéd but features a rich, fascinating performance from Blanchett
","'The Virgin Queen', Queen Elizabeth I, arguably the greatest monarchial leader England has ever seen, has received the royal treatment when it comes to the cinema. She has been played by an abundantly wide plethora of actresses, both old and young, and has garnered more than a few awards and nominations for those actresses. Arguably the greatest incarnation of the queen, though, and also probably the best film about the monarch, is 1998's Elizabeth, which was unfairly overshadowed by the vastly inferior and overrated Shakespeare in Love due to both films being set in the same time period and featuring a virtually identical cast of actors. But while Shakespeare in Love was light, fluffy, and almost irritatingly cutesy, Elizabeth was a far darker, grander, broodier incarnation of 16th century England, and featured a performance that should have gotten Cate Blanchett her first Academy Award were it not for Miramax's relentless promotion of Shakespeare In Love and the eventual (and undeserved) victory Gwyneth Paltrow of that very film scored in the category. With The Golden Age, the cast and crew were given a rare chance: A chance to re-tread the brilliant ground without the pressures of an all-too-similar parallel film. And unfortunately, for the most part, they missed that chance.While the first Elizabeth film served as a wondrous combination between dramatization of a fascinating period in England's history, deliciously lavish production design, and an intense, amazingly dedicated character study on Cate Blanchett's part as she dubiously explores every possible nook and cranny of the mysterious Virgin Queen. The sequel gains much by retaining high quality in the latter two categories, but suffers miserably from severe drawbacks in the first and arguably most important category.The film easily confuses epic and heroics with clichés, and is weighed down by an overwrought script not much above cheap daytime television melodrama in terms of the plot events. All would be forgiven had these elements been even remotely rooted in historical fact, but in reality the filmmakers took uncanny liberties and unabashedly replaced historical fact with melodramatic romance and epic fantasy action. Is she with child without royal consent? Would Sir Walter Raleigh have ever possibly swing heroically from ropes off of burning ships, dramatically brandishing his sword? Did Queen Elizabeth really ride horseback out to give her army a pep talk, even though we don't even see any of these soldiers in action when the day is done? Does it even matter than in 1585, when the film is set, Elizabeth was over 50 while Raleigh was barely 30, thus rendering their imaginary romance conceived especially for this film quite unrealistic? Indeed probably the biggest drawback to the film's replacing fact with melodramatic fantasy-fiction is that in most of the cases, it is totally unnecessary and barely felt. The film shifts gear from lavish costume drama to epic sea battle action for probably no more than five minutes before hastily returning to form. The Armada battle is over so quickly one barely even has time to notice Raleigh's exaggerated swashbuckling heroics.That said, the film does have two slightly more successful fields, first and foremost its lavish look. Costume dramas traditionally exceed in the production, set and costume design fields, but the costumes Queen Elizabeth wears alone are sure to win awards. Such meticulous detail is put into designing every last frill and tapestry, that the film is undeniably a true work of design mastery, much like the first film. The cinematography is also more than complementary of the look and direction the film obviously was aiming at, drenching almost every scene with very dim but harsh glows, leaving many blacks and shadows, perhaps in order to emulate Elizabeth's state of mind. The country is prospering, but the Queen is forever torn inside.And indeed the film more than excels in that final category, regarding the character study of Queen Elizabeth. And for that I give most of the credit to Miss Blanchett. It's impossible to deny it: Cate Blanchett is indisputably one of today's very best and most prominent leading actresses, and in recent years in particular she has more than excelled in delivering fascinatingly multi-layered and expertly acted roles in every genre possible. Blanchett is no stranger to playing real-life people: Aside from already playing Queen Elizabeth I in the 1998 film, she has also channeled Veronica Guerin, Katharine Hepburn, and Bob Dylan. But with Queen Elizabeth, Blanchett gets to do something very special: Since the character comes from a time before the media era, there is essentially nothing for Blanchett to imitate and to base her performance on. Thus, she is forced to (and succeeds admirably in) finding the character within Queen Elizabeth on her own. She plays her with a wonderfully entertaining combination of authoritarian matriarch and playful, mischievous teenager. Cate delivers a truly powerhouse performance in the film, and her performance is easily the best aspect of it. Just watch how broken she is as she mourns the treachery of her own sister, Mary Queen of Scots, expertly played by Samantha Morton and also the only of the film's plot points that was actually remotely interesting to watch unfold.I was greatly looking forward to this film; the historical costume drama is a consistently reliable genre, and the concept of the combination of epic swashbuckling action-adventure with the dramatic depiction of Elizabeth's reign, as well as the notion of Blanchett returning to arguably her greatest film role, got me perhaps a little over-excited for this release, which made the poor reviews and subsequent box office performance even more disappointing than I would have expected. The film indeed suffered from some inconsolable plot weaknesses, but does feature exquisitely lavish production design and an expertly poignant, rounded and fantastically intense performance from the always great Cate Blanchett, and that's enough to make it even somewhat worth a look.",6,3,4,23 December 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The greatest epic ever made
","The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is, hands down, among the most spectacular and magnificent films of all time.A short run-down of the plot: After the battle of Helm's Deep and Saruman's imprisonment in his tower Orthanc, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf re-group with Merry and Pippin in Isengard. There they learn that the army of Sauron is planning a full-scale attack on the largest city of men - Minas Tirith in Gondor. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to warn Denethor, the steward of Gondor, of the threat from Mordor. Defenses are built up as the army of Sauron marches across the Pelennor Fields towards Minas Tirith. A distress call is sent to Rohan, still recovering from Helm's Deep. Rohan manage to muster a large army, and set out for Minas Tirith, but the battle has already begun. In the meantime, we continue with Sam and Frodo on their quest to destroy the One Ring.A major achievement of this epic film is the character development. Gollum becomes more cunning and sneaky than ever, and manages to turn Frodo against Sam, who is desperately trying his best to get his old Frodo back. Merry and Pippin are no longer just a source of comic relief, both of them prove themselves worthy as they are split up for the final battle. We learn about the true bravery and potential of hobbits as Merry helps cut down the Witch King. Eowyn also proves herself in the film, as she defies her uncle and sets out to Pelennor fields with the other Rohirrim, and eventually destroys the Witch King, and makes a very feminist remark while doing so. We learn to loathe Denethor because of his hatred of his last remaining son, Faramir, who really hasn't done anything wrong. The peak of our hatred for Denethor is reached in the scene where he tells Faramir that he would have preferred it if he had died instead of Boromir, his brother. And then, right after that, Denethor sends Faramir into certain suicide, and Faramir immediately accepts the mission he is appointed to, in a final attempt to please his father. And of course, Aragorn learns to accept his fate as the true king of men.In fact, the character development is so powerful that we actually participate in the character's feelings. We FEEL Frodo's exhaustion and agony as he literally drags himself across Mordor. We feel Sam's pain as Frodo is turned against him. And, just briefly, we participate in Gollum's triumph as he finally gets the One Ring. We are actually happy for Gollum and just for a brief moment, Frodo becomes the bad guy as he tries to take the ring back. All in all, Return of the King contains the most moving, emotional and touching scenes in the entire trilogy, and some of the best acting, especially from Sean Astin (Sam), Elijah Wood (Frodo), Ian McKellen (Gandalf), John Noble (Denethor, he is very successful in adding depth to his character), Miranda Otto (Eowyn), and of course, Andy Serkis (Smeagol, and top-notch at it, just like in The Two Towers).The battle of Pelennor fields may be THE most spectacular and epic sequence in film history. Unlike Helm's Deep, Pelennor Fields shows the true cleverness of Sauron's army. Orcs are not the only participants; trolls are heavily used in the battle, as warriors and as beasts of burden. The nazgul are very significant in the battle, and while the Witch King didn't actually lead the battle as he did in the book, the nine ringwraiths and their fell beasts still play a key part and do lots of damage in the battle. We see just how powerful the nazgul really are. And of course, the men from the south and their massive oliphaunts play a significant part. While in Helm's Deep we felt triumphant, in Pelennor fields we only feel the triumph briefly, as the Rohirrim make their charge into the horde of orcs and trolls. The triumph in Pelennor Fields almost immediately dissolves, as the Rohirrim are trampled down by the oliphaunts. The battle is won, but we're not happy, we're grieved for all the destruction, all the losses. It's a totally different feeling than Helm's Deep, and makes this battle all the more superior.Return of the King features the most magnificent visuals in the entire trilogy. Whether they are of Minas Tirith, Pelennor Fields and Osgiliath, Mordor and the slopes of Mt. Doom or the climb to Shelob's cave near Minas Morgul, Peter Jackson really shows us the true impact of these landscapes and images.Many people may complain about the changes in the movie, especially the significant cut of Saruman from the end, but you must realize that if they would have featured the whole part with Saruman the movie would have continued another hour and a half. Don't fret; Peter Jackson said the scenes will all appear in the extended version of the film. The ending is long enough as it is, and the film continues at least another half an hour after the Ring is no more. The hobbits return to the shire, and Sam marries Rosie. Aragorn meets his fate and is crowned king, and is finally reunited with Arwen. And of course, one of the most moving scenes in the movie, in which Frodo gets on the last ship to the Undying lands with Bilbo, Gandalf, and the last of the elves (Galadriel and Elrond to name a few), and must part with his three hobbit friends for good.All in all, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is one the most fine-tuned, cinematically perfect films ever made, it's absolutely flawless in every aspect. The Lord of the Rings trilogy as a whole is a spectacular achievement in film making history, and all three movies are together, without a doubt, the greatest epic ever made.",10,65,86,27 October 2005
300," Visually breathtaking if glaringly flawed
","At a first, objective glance, I find it incredibly easy to dismiss this film. It suffers from everything from genre clichés  so yeah, the wailing woman soundtrack worked well on Gladiator but that doesn't mean it has to be used in every historical epic made  to a screenplay emptier than the dark pit into which the Spartans cast their enemies; and with such an excessive use of slow-motion photography, one wonders just how short the film would actually be had the entire thing been played at normal speed. Despite this, at the same time, I found 300 to be nothing short of a groundbreaking achievement. And if one looks a little further outside of the box at this film, one will see that there is much more than meets the eye. Despite its obviously out-of-the-box nature, I can't convince myself to ignore some glaringly problematic flaws the film suffers from. While its action scenes keep the blood pumping and the adrenaline flowing, I must admit that during most of the scenes in which killing of some kind was not depicted, I found myself indifferent and bored. The filmmakers attempted to interweave a subliminal political/social message into the film  some dribble about glory and freedom  which came across as forced, ridiculous and underplayed. Also, I found the utter lack of any characterization to be an irritating distraction. The previous Frank Miller adaptation, Sin City, was populated by caricatures. This time around, 300 is populated by nothing less than cardboard cut-outs; characters so utterly devoid of any traits or characteristics or anything interesting whatsoever about them that it's beyond the level of stereotypes. The acting too was mostly problematic, with Gerard Butler delivering a borderline-irritating performance, shouting and screaming for dramatic effect alone without even an ounce of conviction or sincerity in his words. The rest of the actors seem to be practically sleepwalking through the entire show. The film almost  but not quite  makes up for these glaring flaws with its incredible achievements in other fields, but I really feel that these problems drag it down and could have easily been fixed to create a truly compelling work. But alas, no film is perfect.Unsurprisingly, probably one of the most noticeable aspects of the film's screenplay is its exaggerated, unbelievable, outrageous and sometimes downright ridiculous over-the-top nature. But since Snyder and Miller so cleverly book ended the film with a subjective storyteller, effectively they give themselves total freedom to spin the tale what which way they please. If you think about it, this really gives them the artistic license to include the over-exaggerations, the glorifying, and the outrageousness: monstrous creature-men, terrifying mutants, giant god-kings, over-sized elephants and other creatures, and so on. Actually, I quite liked this aspect, as it added a totally original spin to the classic, historic tale. Indeed, had 300 been a regular sword-and-sandals historical epic, I doubt it would really have anything new or interesting to add to the genre. By in actual fact crafting what can most easily be described as a fantasy film, Snyder and Miller portray the genre in a fresh, new, imaginative way as never has been seen before.I am not a big supporter of the digital revolution. I think that movies like George Lucas' Star Wars prequels and to a lesser extent most any other significant action film from the past few years overuse and abuse the CGI tool to the point of excessiveness, and it all just comes across as terribly, unimpressive laziness. The two major flaws of over-using CGI is that it isn't well developed enough to carry an entire movie realistically and convincingly, and the other is that it really comes across as lazy and negligent  Lucas' Star Wars prequels in particular are living proof of everything that is bad about CGI. But in 2005, Robert Rodriguez treaded new ground in the CGI territory, and with 300 now Zack Snyder takes the CGI tool to entirely revolutionary levels. Instead of using CGI to replace reality, Snyder uses it to create imagery that is otherwise utterly impossible to create in a practical manner. By doing this, I can truly and honestly say that Snyder has crafted a groundbreaking film that uses CGI not as a tool but as an art form.And I don't say this lightly whatsoever. Indeed, this total freedom Snyder has given himself by filming on blue screen sets allows him to craft what may be one of the most visually creative, unique and utterly astoundingly beautiful films of all time. I'm not exaggerating when I say that every single shot of this film is a heart stopping, breathtakingly gorgeous work of art; a renaissance masterpiece of the modern age. The sepia tones, the golden gleam, the striking dark shadows, the contrasts, the vibrancy this film is simply put, visually astounding.In all, notwithstanding the ridiculous plot and story elements, painfully flat characters and boring, pointless talky scenes, 300 is a totally unique, brilliantly creative and an arrestingly visual masterpiece: With the most creative and breathtakingly artistic use of CGI imagery in any movie, 300 may just pave the path to a new, entirely visually liberated style of film-making. And if one views the film as a fantasy piece as opposed to a historical epic, one realizes that it's all in fun and just an entertaining, wildly crazy ride. Still, some flaws are too glaring to forgive, and had the film sharpened itself in terms of characters and story, it would have been far better than it actually is.",7,1,3,27 April 2007
Sin City," One awesome cinematic experience.
","It's ultra-violent, it's sexist, it's bloody, it's vicious, and it's not Tarantino. Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino's best friend (they sometimes refer to each-other as 'brothers'), brings us the latest Tarantino-fest. It's called Sin City.I never considered Robert Rodriguez to be a genius, nor a good filmmaker. His repertoire includes such masterpieces as 'From Dusk 'Till Dawn', 'The Faculty', the 'Spy Kids' trilogy, 'Once Upon A Time In Mexico', and more. Just to make it perfectly clear, that last sentence was completely sarcastic. Sin City is, hands down, his best movie, and also the only one of his movies that's actually any good. And yet, the next project he chose for himself is titled 'The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D'. That should explain it all. It always amazed me that the same director that directed From Dusk 'Till Dawn (one of the most violent and gory movies I've seen) also directed Spy Kids. And yet, somehow, he does it.With Sin City, Robert Rodriguez brings us his next violence-fest, and also (somehow) one great movie. And violent is an understatement. Sin City is VIOLENT. It is not for the weak stomached, nor for the weak-hearted. Anyone who can get past that part, though, and stomach the ultra-violence, will have a blast.Sin City is based on the comic book series written by Frank Miller. Miller was very hesitant when he was approached regarding the making of the movie. He had a bad experience when something he wrote was completely butchered by Hollywood, and changed into an ultimately horrible movie (Robocop 2). Rodriguez managed to convince Miller, though, by telling him that Sin City wouldn't be an adaptation of the comic book, it would BE the comic book. Rodriguez committed to making his adaptation of the comics as accurate as possible. And thus he did. Sin City is literally identical to the comics. There isn't even a screen writing credit, because no screenplay was written. The plot and all the dialogs are lifted directly from the pages of the comic books. And that's not all: Rodriguez used the comics as storyboards for the film. The shots and overall look of the film is EXACTLY how it is in the comics. Rodriguez even gave Frank Miller credit as director, even though he didn't direct a minute of the movie. Rodriguez claimed that Miller's comics were such an important part of the overall look of the movie that he had to give him credit.Sin City isn't only unique in that sense. It is also unique in its technical aspect. The actors were filmed in front of a blue-screen, and everything else was added to the film later. And I mean everything. Not a single set was built for the movie, all the imagery aside from the actors (including cars and other objects in the foreground, not only the backgrounds) is computer generated, and added in after the principal shooting of the actors. Also, it was filmed on High Definition Digital film, which makes Sin City the first fully, 100% digital motion picture.Sin City also showcases an outstanding visual language. The entire film is in high contrast black and white, like the old film-noir movies, save for a few objects in the frame. An example of this can be seen in the following image: Even if you're not into the plot, or the characters, the film is simply gorgeous, and a treat to look at.I won't say that the acting is top notch, because it isn't amazing, but it isn't bad, either. No performances really stood out, but they were all quite fine. What I can say, though, is that the cast is absolutely sensational. The cast includes: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King, Brittany Murphy, Michael Clarke Duncan, Alexis Bledel, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, and more.Plot-wise, the film is based on the first three stories in the Sin City comic book series. These three stories are intertwined within one another, Pulp Fiction-style. The plot of every one of them is fairly simple, and I won't write it here because there really isn't any point. The characters are also unavoidably shallow. None of them have much depth, and they're very black-and-white, in the sense that it's perfectly clear who the good guys are, and who the bad guys are. The main characters (three of them) are the only ones who have even the slightest bit of depth, but this depth is composed of one, single motive that keeps them going, and nothing more deep and complex than that. I was actually surprised how good I felt after seeing the movie. Usually, I only like meaningful movies. And when I say meaningful, I don't necessarily mean movies with a profound social message, or deep philosophies or metaphors. I mean movies that have even the slightest bit of depth in them. This could even mean a very simple movie that simply has ultra-deep and multi-layered characters. Sin City has none of these, and yet, I really enjoyed it, and thought it was great. Just goes to show that sometimes, movies don't have to be profoundly deep to be good.All in all, Sin City is a great movie, and one awesome cinematic experience. It's definitely not for kids, though. And kids, don't try to convince your parents to take you. They'll never forgive themselves if they agree. But if you can get past the ultra-violence, you'll have a great and enjoyable cinematic experience.",8,0,1,27 October 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Unique and beautiful; more dark and gritty than 'feel-good'
","Boyle's previous films are all fast-paced and energetic, and Slumdog Millionaire is an incredibly, frantically energetic film. From its opening interrogation scene, the film grabs a hold and never lets go. The exceptionally potent screenplay by Simon Beaufoy creates profuse quantities of tension and excitement, combining three parallel story lines  the interrogation following the game show, all of the events in the protagonist's life leading up to the game show, and the game show itself  and bounding between them frequently, constructing a fragmented chronology that only steps up the tension. Combine that with the natural tension of a trivia game show such as 'Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?', and we end up with an irresistible brisk, energetic film.Boyle goes all-out with his cinematography; Anthony Dod Mantle combines a wondrous, exciting amalgamation of angles, focal lengths, camera movements (mainly hand-held), wide lenses and lighting set-ups to showcase and emphasize the natural energy and liveliness of the Mumbai slums where the film takes place. In fact, all of the technical elements of the film come together to create an astonishing palette of life and atmosphere, from the naturalistic costume and set design to the delightfully eclectic musical score by A.R. Rahman featuring a modernistic combination of pop songs, electronica and traditional Indian music. Getting all of these elements to come together and complement one another is a difficult enough task; but with the on-location shoot in the slums of Mumbai and other Indian shooting locations, Boyle's task is made even more difficult. It is an incredible directorial feat to undertake, and that's before counting in the local, non-actor, child cast members who deliver their lines in Hindu, when Boyle himself is English and doesn't speak English. The language barrier is broken and Boyle coaxes out of his cast members, both local and internationally known, wonderful and subtle performances that further reinforces his directorial achievement.Many people have been hailing it as 'this year's Little Miss Sunshine and Juno', the 'little, feel-good indie film that could', but Slumdog Millionaire reminded me mostly of the 2002 Fernando Meirelles-directed Brazilian film, City of God. Both films are substantially darker and grittier than any American feel-good indie comedic-drama, and both create a gloomy, coarse portrait of the hardships of local life in the slums, City of God portraying the slums of Rio de Janiero, and Slumdog Millionaire focusing on the slums of Mumbai. It's a daily struggle to survive, and people live in the harshest of conditions; but while the exoticness and apparent difficulty of these lifestyles may throw the average viewer off, the incredible thing is that the people who live in these places aren't only used to them, but seem to embrace them and find the good in situations that seem to the average viewer impossible to live in. Going further, both City of God and Slumdog Millionaire feature two characters whose maturity develops in parallel, with one going down the straight path while the other gets desperately involved in a life of crime, the only outlet for many in the slums. In the former film, these are two childhood friends; in the latter, brothers.That said, there is one significant point in which the films differ: While Slumdog Millionaire frames its story and characters with a melodramatic plot of hopelessly epic romantic love that transcends the ages, City of God portrays its characters and story with a far more realistic approach. The love story on display in Slumdog Millionaire is romantic and feel-good, but it lacks that realistic, naturalistic punch that City of God carries with it, and ends up preventing the film from reaching the true greatness of its Brazilian counterpart.Many have been hailing Slumdog Millionaire as the 'feel-good film of the year'. But in fact, it is far from it: While its final message may be heartwarming and uplifting, most of the film shows us a dark, gritty portrayal of people in our modern world living in the most difficult of circumstances. The exotic depiction of the 'real India' as it is referred to in the film is unique and beautiful; frightening and magical; energetic and lively while at the same time shocking and mesmerizing. Boyle gives this depiction an unprecedentedly skillful portrayal, featuring energetic cinematography and featuring wonderful performances from a very diverse cast, many of whom are local non-actors delivering lines in Hindu. And screenwriter Simon Beaufoy has framed this depiction with a wonderful story of a young slumdog winning the grand prize while playing on the 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' television game show program, his knowledge of the answers to the questions deriving from his various, colourful experiences as a young man growing up in the harshest circumstances Mumbai has to offer.",8,3,5,9 January 2009
The Social Network," A timeless story of friendship, loyalty, greed and betrayal
","I just want to get this out there right away and put the cards on the table so to speak: When I first heard about it, I had very little faith in this project. I was stupefied, confused by the thought of what attracted all this talent to this seemingly trivial story to begin with? Why would David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin possibly be interested in the story of the founding of Facebook? Surely they could have found something more important, more meaningful to apply their efforts to. After seeing the film, though, I realized that, of course, Fincher and Sorkin knew what they were doing all along. And furthermore that labeling this as 'The Facebook movie' is really an insult to what Sorkin and Fincher were trying to and have succeeded in achieving with this film.First and foremost, I have to take a step back and admire this film as a technical achievement. Despite seeming to be a departure for Fincher in terms of content and subject matter – which it is and then again isn't – the film is very clearly and undeniably a Fincher film. Re-teaming with his Fight Club director of photography Jeff Cronenweth, Fincher manages to create and capture that really unique look all of his films have. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous – once again, Fincher proves that he is probably getting the best results in digital photography out of any other director working in that medium, and this film, shot on the RED One camera, looks absolutely beautiful, from the framing to the camera movement to the lighting and on to the look and the feel of the depth of field the RED captures.Sorkin's script is also an impeccable achievement and showcases, once again just what a genius this man really is. From a structural standpoint it employs a very effective use of a framing device – the Zuckerberg lawsuit depositions, which introduce the various characters and lead into 'flashbacks' of the events being discussed. It really lends the film a Rashomon air and intensifies the mystery behind the Zuckerberg character and what exactly transpired in the creation of this phenomenon, Facebook. Sorkin also demonstrates an acute awareness of character construction, and manages to create a loathsome protagonist we hate and are frustrated by but yet we still end up sympathizing with. Most of all, though, it's a showcase of Sorkin's impeccable writing style and knack for writing dialogue with a very unique sound and rhythm. I saw Fincher refer to it as 'Sorkinese' in an interview, and this is a really good description – it is certainly very unique to Sorkin and the scripts he has written, and it is also certainly a completely unique language – one which normal people in our real world do not speak, but that just sounds great on screen. The rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue remains one of the highlights of the film for me, and the script is certainly a shoo-in for Oscar consideration.The film is also a rare showcase of pure acting prowess, and features a very interesting and eclectic cast of young actors stepping out of their comfort zones and delivering some truly phenomenal work. The casting of the film is quite a departure for Fincher, who has enough clout to gather the biggest names working in the business. Instead, he opted to go for a cast of relative unknowns or up-and-comers, and really make stars out of them. First and foremost to be mentioned is Jesse Eisenberg, an actor I have personally been a fan of since The Squid and the Whale in 2005 and one whose work I have continued to enjoy since then. However, no matter how good he was in those previous films, none of his previous performances compare to his amazing achievement on this film. Stripping away his signature goofiness and neurosis, Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a cold, calculated and determined genius who knows what he wants, is very confident and forward-looking and will stop at nothing to get it. His counter in the film is Saverin, played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield, a name we will be hearing a lot more of of in the next few years: Saverin is a far more sympathetic character, more warm and inviting – these traits only increase the impact of the tragedy of Zuckerberg's betrayal of their friendship.Many pundits and commentators have designated this to be the 'film that defines our generation', and truly a 'product of its time' in the most literal sense of the word. However, I'm not sure I like this designation, especially since once you watch the film, you very quickly realize that this isn't a story about the founding of Facebook; it's really a story of friendship, ambition and betrayal, a character study of this fascinating individual whose actions in the film happen to depict the invention of an online social networking site that gets out of hand and puts all of his relationships, especially that with his best friend and business partner, in jeopardy. All of the themes mentioned above are universal and can be applied to a number of fantastic films and works of fiction over the centuries, and that, I think, is the greatest achievement of the film.",10,416,683,28 September 2010
Cinderella Man," A truly wonderful film, unfairly overlooked
","Ron Howard is an interesting director, because that there's nothing interesting about him at all. He doesn't wear all black and make spooky Gothic movies; he doesn't wear thick-rimmed glasses, talk nervously and make movies about himself; he doesn't have three names. He is just a regular person who makes totally regular movies. The thing is, he makes GOOD regular movies. They don't have anything particularly special or unique about them, but they're just good all around. It was true with 'Willow', it was true with 'Apollo 13', and it was true with 'A Beautiful Mind'. Now, it's true with 'Cinderella Man'. And this isn't a bad thing at all  on the contrary.Jim Braddock's character is masterfully constructed. Not in a very long time has anybody played such a downright nice man as Jim Braddock. Despite the poverty, the hopelessness, and his losing fights during the Great Depression, Braddock always remains levelheaded, sweet-tempered and concerned about his family above all. I can't recall one boxing movie in which the boxer wasn't a mean, grumpy man (Raging Bull) or single and tough ('Rocky'). This is the only boxing movie I know in which the boxer is a sweet, loving family man, married and with children nonetheless.The acting is superb all around, and I couldn't expect less of the performers involved. Russell Crowe ('Gladiator', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Master & Commander'), while unpredictable and hard to control, is still, I believe, one of the most talented actors working today. His performance in this film is beyond sensational. It's not just in the dramatic moments: it's also the little nuances he includes in his performance, such as in the scene in which he returns to his old boxing bosses and asks them for money to help him pay the electric bill. The look of humiliation and humbleness in his eyes when he walks into that room is priceless. Renee Zelwegger ('Bridget Jones's Diary', 'Chicago', 'Cold Mountain'), another one of my favorite working actresses, also delivers a strong and brilliant performance. She plays Braddock's wife, Mae. Paul Giamatti truly stands out, though, as Joe Gould, Braddock's manager. I believe that Giamatti, a rising lead actor in recent films 'American Splendor' and 'Sideways', is one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood today. His acting is esteemed by critics, but is shunned by his peers in Hollywood. Perhaps his performance in Cinderella Man will finally get him the Oscar nomination he deserved for American Splendor and Sideways.The editing is outstanding. The fights are particularly well edited. The pace is fast, but the editing isn't quick, or rushed. It really pulls you right into the fight, though, and totally engages you. The cinematography, too, is impressive, especially during the boxing scenes. The inter-cutting of point-of-view shots with subjective shots of the two boxers is executed excellently. The cuts occur at just the right times, and the overall effect really lets you feel the adrenaline of the fight.Like most boxing movies (Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby, at least), Cinderella Man isn't even about the boxing. In fact, for most of the middle part of the movie there is no boxing at all: instead, the film portrays how Braddock, his wife, Mae, and their three kids, struggle to survive in the poverty of the Great Depression. The story of a family in the midst of the Great Depression is as compelling as the boxing story. Braddock portrays a much-needed role model, devoted first and foremost to his family. The historical and socio-economic background was powerfully shown and greatly added to the audience's involvement and is particularly relevant to today.But the audience's involvement reaches a peak during the boxing scenes. A combination of identification with Braddock's sympathetic character, masterful directing and flawless editing and cinematography make the boxing scenes, especially the final one, heart pounding, compelling and totally gripping. My heart jumped with every swing, and my grip on the seat handle tightened with every punch. When the audience becomes SO involved with what occurs on the screen, that's the single most prominent sign of good film-making.Of course, the more minor technical aspects of the film are perfect. You couldn't expect less of a period film, really, but it's still an aspect to note: The costumes, sets, production design, lighting, even the props are all top-notch.The film tries its best to avoid clichés, but in some instances, it's hard to do so. It's a regular riches-to rags-to riches story, and the boxing scenes also don't have anything ground-breaking and different about them, but you have to remember that this is a biographical film, and the events that occur in it are all true. Sure, the riches-to rags-to riches story in the film does seem a little far-fetched, but this was the true story of Jim Braddock, and so all clichés in the film are forgiven.Unfortunately and disappointingly, Cinderella Man was not a success in North America, even though it has all the signs to be a real winning and successful movie. Although the movie received very good reviews from critics and audiences, it faired relatively poorly at the box office. Perhaps it was the timing, as these 'Oscar' movies are usually released in November and December, and not in June, when Cinderella Man was released in North America. Moviegoers look for summer blockbusters in June, and not dramas such as this one. Or perhaps Russell Crowe's hotel phone-throwing fiasco turned audiences off. Whatever the reason, I hope the movie's DVD release will incite a new interest in it, just in time for the Oscars.This is a truly wonderful film, unfairly overlooked, and I hope will impress some Oscar voters. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.",8,2,4,27 October 2005
The Fighter," Conventional script elevated by great direction and fantastic performances
","After Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella man, and many others, one begins to wonder how many more boxing movies we really need in the world, and what a new one can bring to the table. Indeed, watching The Fighter, one can't help but wonder what the film can do to renew the genre and bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, the answer is 'nothing much'. The script is a pretty conventional rags-to-riches story, whose most interesting element is the relationship between Micky Ward and his brother, Dickie Eklund. Luckily, Russell and company recognized that this was the strongest aspect of what is otherwise a good but ordinary and somewhat flawed script, with some problems with flat characterizations and unnatural-sounding dialogue. However, everyone involved in the film tries their best to transcend the script, and for the most part, they succeed.Russell's direction is absolutely fantastic. His use of the camera – which still has that indie looseness, free-moving and hand-held and gritty quality to it, which really adds to the atmosphere and energy the film tries to capture. His staging of scenes is fantastic and he usually just lets his actors riff off of one another, sometimes sticking to the script but sometimes talking over one another, interrupting, and creating a very dynamic back-and- forth that further lends to the realistic quality of the film and its setting. A fantastic rock- oriented soundtrack only adds to this energy and atmosphere. In terms of bringing something new to the table of boxing movies, Russell employs a very interesting technique of filming the boxing scenes as they were shown on HBO pay-per-view TV in the 90's; cheap video quality, multi-camera set-ups, the whole package. The boxing scenes were all shot over 3 days, which left the crew just enough time to run through one boxing match at a time and just shooting it as if it were an actual match, the cameras capturing everything, including mistakes and mess-ups and spontaneous, uncontrolled occurrences which yet again add to the very loose and realistic style the film attempts to capture. It is a very interesting and unique technique I have not seen used before, and I thought it was a fresh approach to boxing scenes, which have become very conventional ever since Raging Bull.Ultimately, though, this is a movie about two brothers and their overcoming demons and obstacles in order to succeed and reach their mutual goal, together. Being a character-based film, the success of the acting is a key to the success of the film, and luckily, it is in this field that the film succeeds the most. Mark Wahlberg is adequate in the lead role of Micky Ward. I have never thought much of him as an actor and think that he did an 'okay' job on this film; not bad but not particularly noteworthy. However, his supporting cast all shine, and his chemistry with them, especially with Christian Bale, is really what sells the movie for me. Bale's achievement is nothing short of revolutionary. He completely steals the show as Micky's crack-addicted older brother and trainer, a former boxer himself, and a shadow of his old self, except he can still throw one hell of a punch and knows just what Micky needs to do in order to succeed. Bale completely embodies the role and really gives it his all – both in his appearance (hollow cheeks, bulgy eyes, balding) but also in his bravura performance. It is an incredible feat of acting, one of the best I have seen all year; Bale's best work as an actor yet, and totally deserving of all the accolades it will inevitably receive. Also worth mentioning though are the two main female supporting roles, namely Amy Adams as the tough and sassy but supportive girlfriend, and Melissa Leo as the overbearing mother. Both actresses are very much out of their comfort zone, which is just what makes their performances so good. Adams, who has never really shown her tough side like she does in this film, does a spectacular job, and really creates someone human and relatable out of what is otherwise an underwritten character. The same goes for Melissa Leo: her character could have gone the completely one-dimensional villainous way, but Leo adds a certain humanity to the character which just makes her seem more sad than vicious.Ultimately, The Fighter tells a pretty conventional story in an interesting and not necessarily conventional way. It is a film that could have been over-dramatized and heavy-handed had it been put in another director's hands (see Cinderella Man for an example of over- dramatization), but Russell and his cast reign it in and set out to create a very specific atmosphere and set a particular mood that lends the film a sense of realism and a very unique dynamic energy that, with the help of the fantastic performances from the cast, help carry it above and beyond its conventional script.",8,156,212,18 December 2010
Up in the Air," A fascinating character study and so much more; the best film of 2009
","A major part of what makes this film so successful and effective is its simplicity – and watching it, one is surprised at just how incredible simple it really is. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Reitman does not employ fancy cinematography, visual flair, eccentric music, gimmicky storytelling, or any particularly noteworthy or conspicuous elements to tell his story. It is a very simple and straightforward film – what makes it remarkable is the extraordinary depth and richness that simplicity conceals. First and foremost, the film serves as a resonant and fascinating character study. In the vein of the greatest character studies, Reitman portrays and explores every nook and cranny of the man that is Ryan Bingham: and he is quite a fascinating character indeed. We are introduced to him as a man who lives what can be described as a life of complete freedom: he calls no place home except the skies; he finds such purely joyous pleasure in the details of hotel rooms, car rental services, airport security procedures, efficient packing and travel, membership cards and loyal customer clubs and frequent flier miles. We glimpse his closet at one point and see that he has at most three or four shirts. His apartment, which he spends less than a few days at a time in, is completely bare. Most importantly though, Ryan has no major human connection in his life: not with a romantic partner, not with his co-workers, and not even with his own family. But while most of us would look at such a life as quite miserable, Ryan couldn't be happier or more content with his choice.But Ryan is thrown off balance when technological advances threaten to ground him for life, and when he meets two women who enter his life: the first is a young, fresh-out-of-college employee who is partnered with him on the road so that he can 'show her the ropes'; the second is a free-wheeling woman whom he meets on the road and sees as his counterpart: free from responsibility, reveling in her success and her 'exclusivity' in the form of various membership cards which the two excitedly compare. Most importantly, though, she seems interested in only the most fleeting and casual of human connections, but as their relationship develops, Ryan seems more and more interested in something serious and seems to think that their relationship is headed in that direction. If Reitman treats Ryan's character and the events in his life with utmost maturity and profundity, he manages to find an even more reflective and meaningful resolution: he avoids simple and one-dimensional solutions and provides us with one that is far more thought-provoking and multi-faceted, in which some aspects of Ryan's life and his relationship with his friends and family change, while others end up being too late to change. It is a fascinating, resonant and really significant study of the human condition, what is important in our lives, what abstract terms such as relationships, family, love, freedom, and all these other ideas mean to us as individuals, and so much more.With Up in the Air, Reitman proves that a truly great movie can be made with nothing more than great performances and good writing. Reitman does not employ visual gimmicks, untraditional storytelling techniques, or any other such prominent elements that make some of the best movies ever made as good as they are. Watching Up in the Air, I didn't get the feeling that I was watching something really groundbreaking like I did when watching There Will Be Blood two years ago, which shook me to the core. Up in the Air didn't feel like something revolutionary or important as I was watching it; the cinematography is good but not particularly showy, as is the editing. The design and look of the movie are all pretty standard, rooted in reality and not flashy. The musical score is effective as are the song choices; but again, the soundtrack doesn't particularly stand out – which is why the fact that this movie is so resonant and deep and meaningful is all the more impressive. Three elements in the film do particularly stand out, though. The first is the performances which, like I mentioned, are career highs for all involved, and just totally full-fledged and fascinating and incredible pieces of work. The second is the screenplay that, while fairly straightforward, conceals so much multi-layered depth and significance and is written so well, the dialogue simply jumping off the screen with such vitality and exuberance. It is a film that works on so many levels; it is at once hilarious and genuinely funny and intelligent while at the same time genuinely and poignantly emotional and dramatic. It is at once a multi-faceted character study and an important testament to the current economic climate of our world. It is enjoyable, charming, funny, touching, thought-provoking, poignant, moving and all in all just one of the most full-fledged and genuine cinematic experiences of the year. The third is what brings it all together, what takes a fairly simple premise that could be so easily underplayed by any other director but that brings out everything that makes the movie as good as it is, and that is the director, Jason Reitman. Building up a strong reputation with his past two films, in his third effort, Reitman brings everything together, and directs the film with such focus and maturity and confidence, completely devoid of irony or preciousness and serves to create what is, in my opinion, the best film of the year.",9,0,4,12 January 2010
Atonement," So close to utter and absolute cinematic perfection
","I must admit that I haven't read the novel this film is based on but got a pretty good impression as to its quality judging by the film alone. Simply put, the film tells an absolutely fantastic story that keeps us engaged, enthralled and entranced from the first clicks of Briony's typewriter. Ian McEwan's ambitious tale begins with a whirlwind, joyous and beautiful depiction of young romance, which is so unbelievably dreadfully thrust into a continuous downward spiral of tragedy and disaster. And if this hurricane of tragedy, unrequited emotions and heavy guilt isn't enough, the story is topped off with quite possibly the most tragic, heart wrenching plot point in recent years, as the old version of the Briony character, played by Vanessa Redgrave, comes clean with a shocking revelation. In all, the storytelling structure of the film is fascinating and absolutely thrilling to witness. The same events are shown from multiple reverse angles; mid-way through the story relentlessly jumps forward to a time after what we know were years of pain and agony for our protagonists; and finally, the footnote at the end of the film, the gut-wrenching revelation which throws everything into question and shines a stark, illuminating light on the true nature of the film's emotional tragedy.Wright, this being his second directorial work after Pride and Prejudice, manages to most exceptionally capture the very balance of the work: the balance between broad themes of love, betrayal, tragedy and atonement and between the fine simplicities and nuances such as how his characters talk, act and interact. The film features a stunning balance on Wright's part between sequences of a thrilling, epic nature and scenes of beautiful nuance and subtlety. The entire film has a kind of driving energy behind it propelling the scenes forward in a relentless pace; Wright manages to turn Briony's pressing, triumphant dash through the long hallways of her home in order to show off her newly finished play into a fantastically thrilling scene of excitement and urgency, utilizing all of the cinematic tools available to him. Utilizing all these elements, Wright displays an uncanny technical and cinematic virtuosity, incarnated in all of the cinematic elements the film has to offer.Wright further guarantees his status as a directorial force to be reckoned with in the star-making performances by his young cast. Kiera Knightley had already proved her acting talent in her Oscar-nominated performance in Pride and Prejudice, incidentally also directed by Joe Wright, but it is in Atonement that she delivers her most wonderful, mature and best performance of her career so far. She carries with her an air of maturity, elegance and grace and of course perpetual beauty and snaps out her high class lines with such incredible crass and rapidity, one can simply see the young, adventurous lust just waiting to burst out from underneath. James McAvoy, whose star has been on the constant rise since his starring role in last year's The Last King of Scotland, is sure to get a well-deserved kick into leading man recognition, and his incredibly intense and wonderfully romantic turn in this film is also a career best. Both these actors essentially deliver two roles: the first half depicts their beautiful adolescent, blooming romance and they play the characters so charmingly, we can't help but feel that nobody in the world deserves more to be together than they to. But in the second half of the film, after the tragedy, both portray different versions of their younger selves: Obviously older and more mature, but also skeptic, heartbroken, and desperately, obsessively holding on to the smallest thread of hope they both have of reuniting. The real stunner in the show, though, is young Saoirse Ronan, who plays the 13-year-old version of Briony with such precise, calculated intelligence that the girl is truly frightful. Her prepubescent impatience, immaturity, anger and jealousy seem dangerously harmless at first, but we soon learn that she carries within her an immense destructive power, the reciprocations of which show on both the 18-year-old version and the older version of herself.Impressive as it is, it is nothing new for a director's sophomore cinematic venture to be so skillful. Pulp Fiction, Rushmore, Boogie Nights, and Requiem for a Dream are merely a few examples of director's sophomore frames. But what makes Atonement truly extraordinary as a director's second feature is that it is not the work of a very talented and devoted film geek; but rather, a seminal, beautiful piece of work striking in its resonant thematic prominence, its maturity and also its wondrous display of cinematic aptitude. Joe Wright has directed not one but two period works (Atonement and Pride and Prejudice) one would come to expect from an older generation of filmmakers such as James Ivory, Michael Apted, or Shekhar Kapur  and Wright is only 35 years old. He is without a doubt the youngest director who has managed to capture the precise restraint and calculated technical proficiency to create a good period picture, and with Atonement manages to create much more than that. Suffice it to say that Wright is a director to watch, and if Pride and Prejudice had me interested in his upcoming projects, after Atonement I now eagerly anticipate them. I hope for more of the best from him, and from all of the film's cast and crew, who should all get well-deserved career boosts due to the film's critical success.",9,7,12,25 December 2007
