Howl's Moving Castle," An enjoyable film
","In an alternate world where magic is taken granted, a young woman named Sophie Hatter, lives a quiet life. While her sister gets all the attention in the world, Sophie has accepted a far less visible role as a silent woman who works in the back room of her family shop. Then one day, by a misunderstanding, Sophie angers a powerful Witch of the Waste, who transforms Sophie to an old woman. Sophie starts to look for a possible cure for the spell and ends up working in a moving castle, run by Howl, a young sorcerer with a questionable reputation. How will a headstrong young/old woman who has finally started to come out of her shell manage with a vain and self-centered sorcerer, who might be her only hope?'Howl's Moving Castle' (Hauru no ugoku shiro, 2004) is loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones' novel of the same name. Those who have read the book, especially if they loved it, should prepare themselves that although settings and the characters are mostly the same, the movie does not follow book from word to word, but makes its own version of the same situation. There are some rather notable changes; like that Howl's young student is much younger in the film than he was in the book. However, the themes of the book are present in the film, as well as characters have retained their personalities mostly. Wynne Jones herself gave the film her blessing and enjoyed it, so I guess there is no harm done.Technically the film is once again a delight from maestro Hayao Miyazaki, though it doesn't reach the heights of his previous works. The many details of the alternative, very European looking, world and the moving castle itself (which gives the feeling that it will fall to pieces any given moment) are amazing to watch. Joe Hisaishi also delivers once again a beautiful score to the film, also very European sounding. From the voice acting department I can only comment on the great original Japanese ones, though I've heard that the English dub is not too bad either. Biggest difference would probably be that in Japanese audio Sophie only has one voice actress, whereas in English dub her young and old self are voiced by two different women.After such amazing masterpieces as 'Princess Mononoke' and 'Spirited Away', 'Howl's Moving Castle' is a slight step back in Miyazaki's career. However, it certainly is not a bad film and easily outshines majority of western animations of the past five years. A recommendable film.",8,0,1,13 October 2008
My Neighbor Totoro," A warm and delightful animation that can be enjoyed many times.
","In 1988, Studio Ghibli took quite a financial risk in making two films at the same time. One was 'Grave of the Fireflies', Isao Takahata's undeniable masterpiece. The other one is this, Hayao Miyazaki's final break through as an internationally known director, 'My Neighbour Totoro' (Tonari no Totoro, 1988). Although the difference between the two films is like a day and night, they have both earned their places amongst great animations. If 'Grave of the Fireflies' made you cry, 'Totoro' will quickly put a smile back to your face.The story centers around two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who move to country with their father, while their mother is recovering in a hospital from an unspecified illness. While the girls try to cope with their mother's situation and their new environment, they also meet a strange spirit named Totoro who lives in the nearby forest.There really is nothing more to tell about the plot without giving away too much. 'Totoro' is a very simple film and works that way. It's absolutely positive film, one that makes you smile, no matter if you're a child of not. This may be the most 'suitable for children film' Miyazaki has made, but it is certainly suitable for more mature viewers also. I am nearly 20 year old guy and I think this is a fantastic film. It's such a perfect family movie in many ways. For one there are the fantasy elements with Totoro (who looks so utterly incredible that it's no wonder it made to Ghibli's logo) and the various incredible things the girls experience with it. But there are also suitable amount of realism (with the mother and her illness) that the film stays nicely close to earth.I really have difficult time explaining what makes this film so unique. Like most Ghibli films you just have to experience them. The various scenes in this film are at the same time so simple and yet so imaginative you wouldn't believe it (my favorite is the scene where Satsuki and Totoro both wait a buss in the rain). 'Totoro' simply has that magic of animation that makes you love it. Technically the film is yet another sample of Miyazaki's talents, and with this film I believe he finally reached his own style that has followed to his later films. Joe Hisaishi once again creates the most magical music that a film like this deserves. I haven't heard either of the two English dubs so I can't tell about them, but Japanese audio is once again done with professional talent. The older sister Satsuki is voiced by Noriko Hidaka, whom anime fans know as Akane in 'Ranma 1/2', Jean in 'Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water', Kikyo in 'Inuyasha' and Near in 'Death Note'. In a minor role as the mother of the girls, is Sumi Shimamoto, who voiced the title character in early Ghibli movie 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'.I really would want to recommend this film more and tell about how fantastic and adorable it is, but I simply can't find words for it. I happily recommend this film, no matter if you watch it alone or with a whole family. It made me smile like a ten year old, and that doesn't happen very often. This film lasts through many views.",9,0,1,5 September 2008
Spirited Away," One of the most amazing films ever made!
","A 10 year old girl Chihiro and her parents are moving to a new town, when they get lost on the way. They arrive to what seems to be an empty amusement park in where they find tables filled with delicious food, even when there seems to be not a soul around. Greed possesses both mom and dad and they start to eat from the tables. Sadly, it turns out that the amusement park is actually a gateway to another dimension, and the food was meant for many Gods and spirits who dwell there. A powerful witch Yubaba transforms Chihiro's parents to pigs. To save herself and her parents, Chihiro starts to work in Yubaba's bathhouse. There she meets a young dragon-boy Haku, a big sister like Lin and a strange spirit called No-Face who starts to stalk Chihiro.After the success of his masterpiece 'Princess Mononoke', Hayao Miyazaki planned to retire from animation business. Thank God, some quality time with family persuaded Miyazaki to return to Studio Ghibli and make this, his second masterpiece, and in my opinion his best film. 'Spirited Away' (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, 2001) is the most visually amazing, imaginative and heart warming animation I have ever seen (and should definitely have a place in Top 10 Best Fantasy films ever- list). Not only is this, again in my opinion, best Miyazaki film, it is also best Ghibli film and, if not the best, one of the best animations ever made. This film shows more imaginative story telling and detailed characters than all the Star Wars films together. Miyazaki's regular composer, Joe Hisaishi, also deserves special mentioning. Although his music has always been perfect for Miyazaki's earlier films, I really think that he too reached completely new levels here. From the simplest piano notes to the full orchestra symphony, Hisaishi creates some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard inwell, anywhere really.Not only visually fantastic, the movie also manages to keep a very clear plot together and create actually characters viewer truly cares about. Chihiro, despite her rather fantastic surroundings, appears as a very realistic little girl. She is incredibly clumsy at times (I am amazed she didn't break any of her bones during the film) and at times can't take anymore of her new situation and just wants to curl up and cry. Despite that she does finds the energy and determination to strive forward. You just can't help but love her. Also her first-love romance with Haku is really touching.'Spirited Away' is Hayao Miyazaki's own kind of version of 'Alice in Wonderland' and also the most fantastic movie he has made. The film deserved to be awarded with the best animation Oscar in 2001. If Miyazaki ever creates a movie that can surpass this one, as both visually and emotionally fantastic, then he is not a man but a God. One of the most amazing films ever to come across.",10,0,0,11 October 2008
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," 24 years old and outshines many modern animations
","'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind' (Kaze no tani no Naushika, 1984) is often credited as Studio Ghibli's first major film, though technically Ghibli didn't exist at the time film was made, but was founded with the money the film made. However, since the people behind 'Nausicaä' became the leading forces of Ghibli (Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki plus the films music is composed by Joe Hisaishi) it is often marked as Ghibli's first film.The story is set thousand years into the future, where majority of the world has been destroyed in wars and the planet is covered by constantly spreading jungle, that is poisonous to humans but not to gigantic insects living in them. The jungle and insects may seem like the primary concern for the last living human cities, but truthfully the danger is brought by humans themselves, who still haven't learn from past mistakes. A small Valley of the Wind is caught between a war of two bigger nations that are set to destroy the jungle and insects. The Princess of the Valley, Nausicaä, however knows that destroying the jungle would only bring more suffering and determines to stop the war before it is too late.After 24 years of its release, Hayao Miyazaki's second film (first is 'Lupin III: Castle of Cagliostro' from 1979) has survived to this day remarkably well. The traditional animation is far more pleasant to eyes than the nowadays computer-animated-CGI-3D-whatever films that Disney and Pixar give us. 'Nausicaä' combines all the great elements Miyazaki would use in his later film: interesting characters, multi-layered plot, Joe Hisaishi's beautiful music and of course the great animation. One of the important animators in the film was Hideaki Anno, who later directed anime series 'Nadia: the Secret of Blue Water' and 'Neon Genesis Evangelion'. The plot of the film deals with wars, protecting the nature and flying, all things that usually repeat themselves in Miyazaki's works.In voice acting department, Sumi Shimamoto (who had voiced Lady Clarisse in Miyazaki's 'Castle of Cagliostro') could not be more perfect to voice Nausicaä. Her voice truly becomes part of the animated character we see, and Alison Lohman really doesn't stand a chance against her in English dup. Neither can Uma Thurman beat the original Yoshiko Sakakibara (who usually voices tough women like Shinobu Nagumo in 'Patlabor' and Integra Hellsing in 'Hellsing') in the role of Kushana, who commands one of the nations in the film. Patrick Stewart on the other hand does come close to the level of original Goro Naya in the role of Yupa. Still I'd recommend the original Japanese audio more.All in all, 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind' is a film that will keep both adults and children interested and is definitely worth of watching. The film may be just a little bit longer than it should, but with a great story, music and animation it doesn't bother so much. Disney and Pixar should remind themselves that this is how great animation is made.",8,0,1,1 September 2008
Grave of the Fireflies," Takahata's Masterpiece
","Most of the famous war films ever made, like 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Cross of Iron', usually try to show the film and the war from the point of view of soldiers, those who fought in there. It is rare to see a film from the point of view of the innocent victims of the war. Probably the most famous film of victims is Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List'. Even rarer is an animated film of victims of war. Animations in western countries are usually labeled as children's stuff, so it is no wonder Disney has refused to distribute this film, one of the Studio Ghibli's greatest works.'September 21, 1945 that was the night I died'With those words starts director Isao Takahata's most famous film, 'Grave of the Fireflies' (Hotaru no haka, 1988). Unlike his long time friend and colleague Hayao Miyazaki, Takahata prefers to leave fantasy elements in his films to minimum. This is the way how Takahata amazes viewers. If Miyazaki's fantastic visions make our jaws drop to floor with amazement, Takahata's close to reality stories touch us deeply by hitting our emotions. And 'Grave of the Fireflies' certainly does that masterly, being the only film that has ever managed to move me to the point of tears (and I am *not* a teary guy).The film, based on a novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, tells the story of a young boy named Seita, who with his little sister Setsuko, lives in the 1940's Japan, during the World War II. After loosing their mother during a bombing, Seita does everything in his power to create an illusion for Setsuko that things are fine and there is nothing to worry about. The film has been often blamed of being too depressing and having a sad end, but I think it's the opposite. Of course this certainly is not the kind of film to make you smile, but it is already revealed in the beginning that both brother and sister will die. So when we reach the end of the movie, with an image of them as spirits, sitting on a bench looking happy and healthy, with a modern day city around them, this is actually a happy ending after all the suffering they went through.It's very hard to say exactly why this film should deserve full stars from me. It just does. It's full of little beautiful scenes that instantly have an effect on you, accompanied by Michio Mamiya's peaceful music. Maybe the fact that it can make me wonder why it is so good is the proof enough to make it a masterpiece. And that is what 'Grave of the Fireflies' is; a masterpiece. One of the most amazing films from Studio Ghibli and Isao Takahata's most famous film. And definitely the ultimate proof that animations can be used for other than children's stories.",10,8,9,4 September 2008
Castle in the Sky," Action filled adventure to the whole family
","Two years after the success of 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind', the makers released their second film, officially Studio Ghibli's first motion picture. 'Laputa- Castle in the Sky' (Tenku no shiro Rapyuta, 1986) is one of maestro Hayao Miyazaki's most action filled adventure films, where his imaginative visions and never aging animation is once again combined with Joe Hisaishi's beautiful music.This time story is set in an alternative world that has futuristic flying aircrafts but seems otherwise still be in the early 20'Th century. Film's protagonist Pazu is a young boy working in mines, and who dreams of one day finding Laputa, the legendary castle in the sky that his late father claimed to have seen, but whom nobody believed. Pazu's chance to prove his father was right comes unexpectedly when a girl literally falls from the sky to his arms. The girl is Sheeta and she carries with her the key to find Laputa. Since Laputa is claimed to have limitless riches and unforeseen science, Sheeta is chased by air-pirate Dola and her gang, as well as Muska, a power hungry man working for the government. Pazu helps Sheeta and together they try to find Laputa before others.I can imagine how a nowadays Hollywood would probably use a plot like this as an excuse to create a movie with lots of special effects and very little contents. Miyazaki on the other hand over 20 years ago then gave us a film that is both entertaining action film for the whole family and that has interesting and believable characters (interestingly though, this is Miyazaki's only film that has a truly evil villain character, unlike in his later films). As 'Nausicaä' this film's animation has not suffered much during the last decades and is still far more pleasant to watch, than most of the nowadays western animations. Miyazaki's love for flying and aircrafts shows throughout the whole film and everything is crowned with Joe Hisaishi's wonderful score music.I can't comment the original English dub since I've never heard it, but I can compare the original Japanese audio to Disney's 2003 English audio. The new dub has divided opinions a lot since it has altered the original score and added much more lines to the film. The extra lines may be more helpful to the youngest of the family, but really unnecessary for others. Since Joe Hisaishi himself conducted the altered score for the new dub, there really isn't anything bad to say about this and since dub has even more music, it just might be better. Fans of the original Japanese audio though may be puzzled by the changes in the original score. Voice actors differ. Both Mayumi Tanaka and Keiko Yokozawa are believable as kids, Pazu and Sheeta, but neither James Van Der Beek nor Anna Paquin convinces in the dub, having too mature voices. Kotoe Hatsui and Cloris Leachman are both on the same level as pirate Dola, both making the character witty, funny and sarcastic. On the other hand, Mark Hamill completely surpasses Minori Terada in the role of villainous Muska, Hamill's voice being more menacing and evil (10 years of voicing Joker probably helped). So, Disney's dub has more music and Mark Hamill, but otherwise I recommend original Japanese audio. But to each their own taste.Miyazaki's style is not quite there on the top still in this film, but the story telling takes you completely from the very start that you can't but love this film. It is also suitable for all ages, though has moments that mature audience appreciates more. Another classic from Ghibli.",9,0,0,2 September 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, not Bram Stoker's.
","Francis Ford Coppola's film version of Bram Stoker's classic novel is the first Dracula film I ever saw. I don't remember much of my first reactions to it, but it did leave an impression, for since I have been a dedicated fan of Dracula. For a long time I remember thinking very highly of this film, until I started watching other Dracula film adaptations and, more importantly, read the book. Afterwards the film has proved to be quite a disappointing in many aspects, even when I would never really say it's a bad film.In the 15'Th century Transylvania, Prince Vlad Draculea (Gary Oldman) looses his beloved wife because of a treachery. Feeling that he is unjustly rewarded after all of his good deeds, he curses God and sells his soul to devil, thus becoming a powerful vampire. Four centuries later he goes by the name of Count Dracula and prepares to take over the entire world, starting in London. However, there he meets Mina (Winona Ryder) who is an exact image of his long lost wife. While Dracula aims to seduce Mina to his side, his other actions don't go unnoticed by Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), and soon vampire hunters are after the Count.The film goes under the title of 'BRAM STOKER'S Dracula' and Coppola advertised it as the most faithful film version of the book. True, there are many things in this movie from the book that other versions have left out, for example for the first time every major character from the book appears here. However, calling it the most faithful version is a downright lie. That title goes to the 1977 BBC film, starring Louis Jourdan. Coppola could have made this one of the most faithful versions, if he had cut the whole subplot of Dracula and Mina's romance out of the movie (the idea of Dracula looking for a lost love is not even original but was already used in 1973 TV film by Dan Curtis). The most infuriating thing here especially is how out of character Dracula sometimes appears. There is a scene in the film, where Dracula is ready to make Mina a vampire but tries to resist, saying that he loves her too much to condemn her. I found this to bee amazing rubbish. If Dracula would truly find a woman he'd want he would let nothing get to his way. Dracula is both obsessive and possessive. This version makes it seem like he would prefer to have walks with her in a pretty park. Mr. Coppola, you got your Phantom of the Opera and Dracula mixed up.However, as said this is not a bad movie either. Visually the movie is rich and amazing to watch. Garret Lewis' sets are properly Victorian like and Michael Ballhaus' cinematography is flying and imaginative. One of the most memorable aspects of the film is Wojciech Kilar's beautiful music. Although little influenced by John William's 1979 score, Kilar's music can change from powerful apocalyptic atmosphere to a tender, loving sweetness.From the actor department the film has some very good choices and some very, surprisingly, bad ones. Gary Oldman, whenever he is not a sweet 'I won't bite' mood, does a good job with Dracula. He manages to capture the powerful side of Dracula, the war lord in him still yearning for his days of power and glory. However, I am disappointed that he was made to wear weird wolf-like and bat-like suits in the film. I think an actor like Gary Oldman could have been scary without them. Winona Ryder does a decent job as a very Snow-white like Mina. In minor roles both Richard E. Grant and Cary Elwes pass as the young suitors and Tom Waits has a delightful little role as the insane Renfield. Keanu Reeves is the weakest link here as Mina's fiancé Jonathan, completely unable to bring any life to his role. Anthony Hopkins turns out to be a surprising disappointment as Van Helsing. He plays his role so theatrically over the board, making Van Helsing appear as little insane, that I personally would feel safer with Dracula than him.Although I really wouldn't want to say anything bad about this film I have to admit that it has many flaws also. The greatest one is Coppola's trap of making viewer think he'll see a faithful movie version of Bram Stoker's book and is given something else. Still, a decent movie that passes through couple times to be watched.",5,1,2,8 July 2008
Casino Royale," I know it's been said, but this reboot is awesome
","It seems a bit silly to review this film as I'm sure everything has already been said about it. 'Casino Royale' (2006) is either 21st film in the official Bond movie series, or first one in a new rebooted series. It is based on the first Ian Fleming book, which hadn't been filmed in official series before, though there had been a little known live TV film made in the 1950's and a forgettable spoof made in the 60's. The movie starts with a chilling black and white intro where British Secret Service agent James Bond earns his 00 license by killing an agent who had been selling information and his contact. We then see how Bond literally blows up an operation of catching a bomb maker, much to M's displeasure. Bond does however also get a lead of plan to destroy an airplane and stops it. This becomes highly inconvenient to Le Chiffre, a banker of world's terrorists. In order to replace the money he lost he intends to win it back by playing cards in Casino Royale. Bond and Vesper Lynd, agent of HM Treasury, are sent to make sure he doesn't win. The film is directed by Martin Campbell, the same man who updated Bond into a post cold war world in form of Pierce Brosnan in 'GoldenEye'. That was already a great Bond movie, but 'Casino Royale' goes even beyond that. Campbell and the writers reboot the franchise perfectly, updating the 1950's secret agent to the 21st century. The modernization also doesn't really change the story so much. While the movie takes its time before getting to the point where Fleming's book begins, once there it follows the book surprisingly faithfully. The action in the movie is breathtaking. It's back to more realistic stunts than in previous movie, but so intense it puts you on the edge of your seat. Bond is played for the first time by Daniel Craig. When he was announced as new Bond many people were initially against him, as he didn't look right to the part. True, but many people, I among them, were also against Heath Ledger playing Joker in 'The Dark Knight'. Lesson of the story: we really should just wait to see the movie before making judgments. Craig is fantastic in the part, really portraying Bond as a blunt instrument who is both proud and conflicted of his work. This is the truest performance of Fleming's Bond since Timothy Dalton and most impressive one since, dare I say it, Sean Connery.Eva Green plays Vesper Lynd, the first Bond girl from the books. Honestly, I like her portrayal more than how Fleming wrote the character. She is witty and sharp but also more than eye candy and gets through Bond's defenses, which makes her on pair with Diana Rigg for the title of best Bond girl. Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre, the villain of the movie. Not the most memorable Bond villain but Mikkelsen's cold attitude is appropriately creepy, and reminds me of many early Bond villains from Connery era. Good support is provided by Giancarlo Giannini as Rene Mathis and Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter, as well as Judi Dench continuing as M. Not sure why she wasn't replaced but I'm not complaining either, because she's awesome in the part. The long story short, 'Casino Royale' does what it sets out to do: reboots Bond franchise, brings the character back to his roots without out-dating him and is an awesome movie at the same time. This is a full points Bond film.",Null,0,3,2 June 2011
Princess Mononoke," Miyazaki's first true masterpiece
","In an ancient Japan, at a time when Gods and demons walked the earth, a young prince Ashitaka defends his village from a furious demon. Ashitaka slays the beast, but is cursed to suffer an early death. His only hope is to travel to a forest where the Great Spirit is said to dwell. As Ashitaka approaches his destination, he gets in the middle of a war. On the other side is an iron town, lead by Lady Eboshi, who wants to expand their town and live in peace of the beasts. On the other side are the Gods and animals of the forest, who also want to protect their homes. In the forest lives also San, a young girl raised by wolves, who fights for the forest and is after Lady Eboshi. While trying to find a cure for himself, Ashitaka also tries to put a stop to war that will have no winners. But how does a cunning monk Jiko fit in this picture? 'Princess Mononoke' (Mononoke-hime, 1997) is maestro Hayao Miyazaki's first true masterpiece. I'm not saying his previous movies would be bad; on the contrary, you can read my reviews of them and know I love them. However, 'Princess Mononoke', as well as Miyazaki's later film 'Spirited Away', reaches a whole new heights. In this film, Miyazaki returns back to his anti-war and protect the nature themes that he already had in 'Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind'. Especially the mindlessness of the war is well shown in this film. Miyazaki has avoided the cliché situation that on the other side are good guys and on the other bad guys. Both sides have their reasons to get rid of the other one. Both are good guys because they protect their homes and communities, but both are also bad guys: iron town wants to destroy the forest and the beasts want to kill humans. By making Ashitaka, an outsider, the main character we are able to see the war also as an outsider's point of view. We understand the reasons behind both sides, but we can also see that this war will not bring a happy ending to either of the sides.The first time I saw this film I was truly awed. Still at the time being relatively unfamiliar to Miyazaki's works there was nothing that could have prepared me for this. Visually this film is so much more powerful than anything I have seen from Disney or in any other western animation (or in most of Japanese animations for that matter!). The only animations to come to same level with such detailed designs and visual awesomeness are Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away' and Katsuhiro Otomo's 'Akira' (both also from Japan). And what would Miyazaki movie be without the music of Joe Hisaishi. From the epic opening score to the beautiful theme song, Hisaishi offers only the best.It should also be mentioned that 'Princess Mononoke' has a surprisingly good English dub. I usually prefer original Japanese audios, often finding dubs either lacking or going over board. Only few times do I find dub to be as great as the original audio (anime series 'Fullmetal Alchemist' is one of these cases). In 'Mononoke' the English lines are written by Neil Gaiman, author of the books 'Stardust' and 'Neverwhere'. This might explain why 'Mononoke' is the only case when I found the dub even better than the original audio. This has never happened before or later to me. Japanese audio is by no means bad, but talented dubbing cast (including Claire Danes, Minnie Driver and Billy Bob-Thornton) seem to bring just a little bit more life to it.'Princess Mononoke' is an awesome movie, both visually and as a story telling. It has great characters, meaningful story, beautiful score and sequences that make your jaw drop. To me only 'Spirited Away' tops this as the best Hayao Miyazaki film.NOTICE: unlike other Miyazaki films, this can not be recommended to the smallest of the family. Some scenes during the battles are rather graphic.",9,0,1,2 October 2008
