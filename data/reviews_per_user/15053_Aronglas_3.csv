It," Before Seeing, I already knew IT
","Finally I can say what I have been thinking over the past 10years. McDonalds has defeated Burger King once again, you could better change your name to Burger Lose. Before you know it, It delivers it's best perforce. It drags you in it from the start and It basically never let's you go. I could talk about It for a long time but I will keep it short. It is a fantastic film and the only feedback I would give it for a sequel is lose the clown. Besides him the film is great, no clown and It would have gotten it's first 10 on my rating. It is IT's best try and It delivers it's best kids movie to it's date.",9,2,3,26 September 2017
Baby Driver," One of the misfits of the Year
","Baby Driver, a cool music designed film that starts of with a bang. But after a while the film seems to get into a slip of the casual ''hollywood'' same old, same old. Comparing this to a film like ''Overdriver'' or ''Transformers'' Baby Driver just doesn't keep up. It was a good try from Edgar Wright but hopefully he can get his game right with the next instalment.",2,35,72,5 September 2017
American Made," Cruise is Cruising
","Cruise is back in this America made film. ''American Made'' The film starts of with some great sequences but falls quickly for the same old, same old. Comparing this to a film like ''Ron Goossens, Low budget stuntman'' there seems to be that the American film industry can still learn a lot for the industry across the ocean. Cruise is back yes but he is cruising a bit to much for my likeness.",2,20,45,5 September 2017
