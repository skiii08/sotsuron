Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049
","Let's begin positive. Blade Runner 2049 is a lot more ambitious than the original movie from 1982, with a boring Harrison Ford in the leading role. In the new sequel Ryan Gosling plays a new version of a replicant (called K) and it's very descent compared with Ford 35 years ago. Gosling is at his best in the scenes he plays together with Ana de Armas, who is a virtual lust object/ housewife (Joi) in the film. That part about Ana made me really thing about the 2013 movie 'Her', and was one of the better parts of the movie I think. Also the visuals (less then i expected), landscapes, city's and especially the score were bigger, and sometimes HUGE. All those things were the perfect elements to make a movie you totally get sucked in with. Unfortunately Denis Villeneuve didn't manage to stick all these parts together, what results is a movie what wants to be gigantic but ends up disappointing. By 'ends up disappointing' I don't mean the end of the story, but the whole movie in general. The plot of the sci-fi movie, and how it is told, is not that good I think. The first part of the movie (until K thinks he is the son) is much too long and exhausting. It's a build up to a twist that everybody already saw coming after watching 20 minutes of the movie. But that's not really the case. The case is that 20/30 minutes after this twist there is another twist that makes the whole first tiresome 90 minutes totally irrelevant. Only the 'more human than human' part lives one. I think this part can be okay and is interesting. Sadly also this theme fails to come forward in the plot. Jared Leto? I have really nothing to say about him. I loved the kind of sex scene between K and Joi. The scene between Gosling and Ford in the casino/music hall was also something special. The shots from above the city were stunning. Harrison Ford was okay, the character Luv was not very extended but played well. And again the score is enormous. Enough necessities to just go and see this movie in cinema. One tip: don't be wearily if you see this movie.",6,3,5,9 October 2017
Justice League," Justice League
","The problem with this kind of movies and with almost every superhero flick is simply that there's nobody with a bit of creativity in this genre. I agree there are some scenes what give you fun and a little smile on your face, but most of the time this is a smile of awkwardness. First of all; WTF?! stupid way to begin a movie with a shot through an iPhone. The introduction of the three new characters is not noteworthy. Cyborg is the most boring persona ever. Aquaman was okay in the fighting scene's. At least The Flash was sometimes funny, especially together with Wonder Woman. His slow motion parts were enjoyable, but c'mon guys: why again the 'funny' not serious Deadpool type of guy? The villain, uh i don't know his name anymore.... oh Steppenwolf it is.. STUPID NAME. I think Ben Affleck (Batman)and Henry Cavill (Superman) both don't have the strength to carry a mediocre film like this. Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) has this power but couldn't show it in this film, which jumped from scene to scene. After the Wonder Woman movie I had a bit of hope they were going to the right direction. Unfortunately, it's just another below average film. And with the return of Jesse Eisenberg (Lex Luthor) in the upcoming movie, I'm anything but thrilled.",4,1,3,22 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi 'like a catchy pop group'
","It's now or never. They said it more than ones, this was also on the makers there minds. If you don't love Star Wars after this entertaining episode, you never will. The balance between humor and serious Star Wars stuff was perfect. The jokes were placed at the right moments. And the most important thing they did with the jokes is they mock themselves. This worked so well through the entire movie. After 7 episodes, 1 sidequel and more coming up this was the right thing to do.This was like a catchy pop group coming together, unfortunately Kylo Ren gone mental and went solo. But hope they will reunite in IX, he and Rey are meant to be for performing 'Paradise by the dashboard light' and shooting the videoclip in the Red Snoke room.Get your freakin act together Ben!",8,1,1,14 December 2017
Mother!," mother!
","Mother! is that kind of movie that wants to say so much, your brain can't handle it anymore. The setup of the 'i want to be different movie' is a kind of bad nightmare what you have when you're having a fever. Sometimes it's also feeling that way, but it's in a bad sort of way. Mother! or mother! wants to make so much statements, about how the humanity treats each other, and the dis respect against mother nature nowadays, that the whole point of the movie fades away. Thereby you don't care about the character 'mother', because it's not realistic anymore. And i haven't spoke about the whole religious part of the movie yet. The film is like a big wave coming towards you. At first sight it looks thrilling, when it hits you it stays in a freaky kind of way nice. But when you notice you can't get yourself to the surface, and the water keeps running, you want it to be over as soon as possible. The marketing concerning this movie was also strange. it seemed like is was promoted as the next big horror movie, instead it is an experimental psychological art-house movie. Despite all of this, in potential it wasn't a bad movie. Darren Aronofsky can get the best out of his cast and crew members again. Especially in the first bit of the movie the cinematography and natural lighting were sometimes stunning.",5,1,2,20 September 2017
