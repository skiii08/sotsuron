The Devil's Advocate," film ruined by loud music, loud sound effects, and screaming
","I would have given this film a much higher rating, had it not been for the fact that the screaming, music, and sfx were incredibly LOUD, in effect sabotaging the movie and profoundly affecting adversely my enjoyment of it - and my wife's. I had to continually adjust the sound level and, in several passages, I turned the sound completely off. Even so, my eardrums were ringing and literally hurt.The story is fascinating, DeNiro plays a compelling role - but no need to YELL so much. This is a role that needs understatement, not shouting.The title reveals the main thrust of the film, unfortunately, and no one, surely, will be taken by surprise when they find out what is really going on, who's who.This study of high-power attorney brokering, morals, pressures, their activities & romances is truly exciting and suspenseful, a real tour-de-force.The sets are dark, trying to attain a film-noire effect, I assume. I'd have preferred more lighting or a wider lens opening. Of course, the flick itself is 'dark' and clearly the director was striving for atmosphere; I don't feel this was necessary as the story itself unfolds well and provides its own aura. More frightening in broad daylight than in shadows or unlit corners! Certainly recommended, but keep your remote handy for the sound!",5,1,5,19 June 2005
