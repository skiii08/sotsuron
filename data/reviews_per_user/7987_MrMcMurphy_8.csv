Ford v Ferrari," Talk about edge of your seat (I was sweating!)
","ZERO woke. Just pure beautiful entertainment.Not even a racing fan, but I am a movie fan, and I've never seen such incredible racing scenes.Highly recommend seeing it in IMAX/Dolby. Hits you like a ton of bricks.So freakin good! üò≠üëçüëçüëçüëç",10,3,5,16 November 2019
First Man," Tried to split it up just to finish
","Soooooooo boring!I like Gosling, and find substantive movies like 'Schindler's List' engrossing, but this had absolutely NOTHING.I don't understand how someone makes it through this. FRUSTRATINGLY boring.Very sad this has a '7.3' on here. 7.3 usually means something on here.",1,0,3,24 July 2019
The Irishman," Joe Pesci's performance...
","Amazing.The film can be a little slow, but we'll worth it for fans of 'cinema.'Every bit the quality you'd expect from Scorsese.Very cool.",9,4,10,27 November 2019
Match Point," Jeeze, did that get better (slow start!)
","Was gonna turn it off half way through. Was getting mad at Woody for the obviously male written female dialogue, and what I thought was a cheap and predictable 'call back' for a cliche ending. Thought the Allen fans overrated another Allen movie...I was pleasantly surprised, which says a lot. So much painfully boring and predictable garbage out there. This, on the other hand, was worth the time invested.",8,3,3,15 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," For movie fans, period. I hate boring, and this was not that.
","You don't need to care about the '60's or boring slow movies to like this. If you like good dialogue and interesting scenes, YOU WILL BE ENTERTAINED.It would help to one piece of history:Charles Manson got some gullible kids to brutally kill famous director Roman Polanski's pregnant woman, Sharon Tate, and her friends by shooting and stabbing them to death. Horrific and extremely sad.",9,2,3,22 November 2019
Million Dollar Baby," Oscar Winning IDEOLOGY
","The movie didn't win the Oscar, the mercy-killing did.I am a proponent of assisted suicide, but I wouldn't give a movie the Best Picture award because of that.This is a great example of Hollywood putting politics first. It's sad that the very people trusted with designating the most prestigious award in film, one of the most treasured medians, can be so flagrantly bias in doing so. If not for the bias, more people would have seen the film for what it really was: one big, uneventful, depressing, clich√©.After finishing this movie with my dad, we looked at each other like, 'Wow, we will never get those two hours back.'",1,3,6,14 August 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Now THIS is an Action Movie
","With more matured tastes than I use to have, I need more than just action and explosions. I need an ENGROSSING, well acted, well told story.This had everything, and more.'More'? Unpredictability!As the title indicates, it 'Repeats,' but it is NOT repetitive.The director was like a surgeon with the precision he used to tell such an intricate story in such a seamless, fun-to-follow, way.It's an entirely new and original take on 'Repeat' that kept this fan on the 'Edge' of his seat the entire time.10/10",10,1,4,16 October 2014
Am√©lie," Couldn't make it past 48 min, painfully boring
","Art film.Nothing of substance.Endless narration.Don't tell, SHOW.",1,6,13,17 November 2019
