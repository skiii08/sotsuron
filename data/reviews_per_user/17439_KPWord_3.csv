Despicable Me 2," Flows well but the ending is a bit of a disappointment
","This was a great film to watch, with several minion scenes that made me laugh (especially the underground minion party!). But the ending was a bit of a letdown for me.DESPICABLE ME 2 focuses very heavily on further developing the characters from the first film, to the point where I felt the actual plot took a back seat. At the end of the film all the minions had been transformed into invulnerable, ravenous, mindless creatures of destruction... and they are cured within a few minutes of their mass reveal. Furthermore, it wasn't really explain why the serum made minions aggressive and mindless whereas El Macho apparently retained his reasoning faculties.This issue aside, it was a good movie to watch and I enjoyed it. I certainly am looking forward to a Minions movie.",7,0,0,2 July 2013
Knowing," Inaccurate classification
","This movie should have been rated at least one level higher than it was.I saw this movie a few hours ago, expecting it to be the new, epic science-fiction movie with depth that I read about in the reviews here, as well as the parental guide.I was prepared for the various scenes, but what I was not prepared for was the thriller aspect of it.The classification reads that some scenes may frighten children. Well, I am 20 years old and this movie seriously unnerved me. In my books, that is not a good thing.I left the movie about halfway through, and I have no intention of seeing it again.Classification boards, a note: Some of us don't like movies that border on horror/thriller themes.",1,5,12,26 March 2009
Cube," Potential... but deaths senseless
","Okay, I'm assuming that you know the premise of this movie, so I won't repeat others in that regard. But I must ask.Why all the deaths at the end? The student and architect put their heads together at the end and left behind the bad cop. (Which begs the question - how did he become a member of the police force, anyway?) And they are waiting for the exit to appear when the student gasps and... bad cop is back! Now, all throughout the movies the doors make a very loud sliding sound, yet this final door opened without a whisper.Very convenient.But the student dies. The architect dies. And bad cop dies. The only person left alive at the end is the autistic guy, and we don't even know what happened to him.This move really sucked simply because in the end, nobody won. The bad guys died. The good guys died. And since we don't know what happened to the autistic guy he didn't really win either.",2,3,8,27 May 2007
