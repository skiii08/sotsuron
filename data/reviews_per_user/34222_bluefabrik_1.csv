Marie Antoinette," Don't expect a Hollywood movie!
","I loved to see the movie but hated the audience. As the movie goes away from any known Hollywood format, the deceived audience of the theater I went found the slightly funny jokes of the movie tremendously hilarious and decided that the movie was a comedy and they were supposed to laugh out loud. My advice, if you want to see a Hollywood movie don't go for this one and if you want to enjoy a rare masterpiece don't go on a weekend night or don't go to a big theater. While watching this precious artwork, Stalker (Tarkovski's) came to my mind. There is something in the use of time that makes me compare them. This is definitely a successful fusion of American perspective's with European technique.",9,1,4,29 October 2006
