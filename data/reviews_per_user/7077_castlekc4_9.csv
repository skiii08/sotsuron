First Man," Too long
",They could've cut 45 minutes out of this story ..... otherwise a good show about a heartbroken man desperate to escape his sadness . I had no idea .....,6,2,4,6 March 2019
Memento," Not in my memento drawer...
","I just pushed through this film , waiting for the brilliant twist .... this film is ridiculously overrated . That stupid car was the main character ... it was in practically every scene , and if I heard that car alarm ' chirp' one one time , I was gonna scream .",3,4,10,12 May 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Nope
","Such a slow start ...... forced myself thru the first 30 minutes..... the makeup for 'Freddie' was terrible , omg those teeth . And why did they keep the actors blue eyes? The last 15 minutes was good..... a nice tribute to Mercury's incredible voice . But a disappointment overall",4,2,4,3 March 2019

Les Mis√©rables," I'm in the minority
","I don't like musicals .... but this is such a magnificent story , I thought I could fast forward through the songs . Little did I know that ever word was sung . Ugggggg . Such a shame . The version with Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush puts this rendition to shame .",4,2,7,29 March 2019
The Big Short," Sad, but not for the reason depicted
","Banks are business . Business does not worry about people's feelings or well being . What's pathetic here, is that millions of people took on loans that they clearly could not afford to repay . I was offered one of these loans back in my house hunting days .....it's not rocket science . If you bring home $1000 a month, you can't afford to pay a $1000 a month payment . I don't care how hard the bank tries to sell you their product , you have to take some responsibility. Mind boggling .",8,0,0,16 May 2020
Signs," Unique thriller that pulls at your heart strings
",Wonderful family tale .... with sci fi thrown in . Abigail Breslin is a scene stealer .... she is beyond captivating...... forget the cheesy aliens ... thats not what this story is about .,9,0,1,27 April 2019
