The Blair Witch Project," If this doesn't scare you, no film will
","Few films manage to capture the starkly shattering fear of encountering that which is beyond human ken.  Of realising that once you step beyond the glow of the self-congratulatory campfire called human civilisation, you find yourself a shivering hominid a million years in the past confronting the Outer Dark, and all bets are off.The impressively negative popular reaction to what, ironically, was an extremely popular film, says something about how comfortable, cynical, and amazingly unimaginative First-World humans really are nowadays.  We live in the age where a gun isn't scary until it's pointed directly at you, if even then...so asking people to remember how to use their imaginations is probably a lost cause.But that's unfortunate, because _The Blair Witch Project_ is in a class by itself in the Horror genre, and deserves to scare people paranoid.  It's a work that translates the 'diary found in a cabin' idea popular among writers like H.P. Lovecraft, to film.  It demonstrates amply, despite all the jaded critique, how quickly the human mind breaks down outside of reassuring frames of reference.  And it looks real.This film cost me sleep, had me looking over my shoulder, distrusting curtains, groups of trees, and open dark doorways for days.  It scared me silly, and it still does.  Even writing this review scares me.  It's one of those films, like John Carpenter's _The Thing_, or Kubrick's _The Shining_, that gets scarier the more often one perceives it, and the more thought one puts into the dilemma.  If you're at all empathic, and if modern life hasn't dulled your sensitivity to the Unknown completely, you'll probably find this film disturbingly effective.",10,1,2,20 March 2000
Alien 3," A masterpiece of subtext, audience manipulation, and the perfect continuation of the Saga
","This is the film that tips the Alien Saga into the shadow of the valley of death - _Alien Resurrection_ chronicles climbing free of this valley; neither are easy films, compared to the first two.  Good that Fox didn't take the easy way out and instead sought novelty with each installment.As Sigourney Weaver hirself commented at the time, _Alien3_ subtextually addresses AIDS.  There are many clues to this, and figuring out the puzzle can add to one's enjoyment of the film (just as figuring out A4's puzzles can do likewise).  It's almost like a psychic game being played on the audience: it's difficult to 'progress' emotionally into a liking of the film until one spends the requisite effort.(SPOILERS?)Clues to the AIDS subtext include the prisoners' noted celibacy, the needle imagery, the excessive bloodiness (the creature is a blood monster), that the creature emerged from a dog that had brutal oral sex with an Alien, the large body count; and especially one scene in which two prisoners run into each other in the tunnels, whereupon one chastises the other for holding a pair of scissors point-out ('You could kill somebody you moron') - this scene makes no sense ordinarily, seeming like a comic overreaction, but becomes intelligible when realised to be symbolic of needlestick accidents.This is a film about sickness, and it did its level best to make the audience, and especially Alien fans, feel that sickness with their very being.  Favourite characters killed off immediately, this endless cycle of hopelessness, a melodramatic joke or poignant coda of an ending (hinging on one's interpretation)...as James Cameron said:  'Alien3 s**t on the audience'.  Exactly.  A morbidly effective film, as was _Alien Resurrection_.  Not surprising that so many gung-ho action freaks disliked it: it's a film about disease and rape and loss, where we learn there are no happy endings.  Yikes!Amusing also that many people open-minded enough to appreciate _Alien3_ repugn _Alien Resurrection_.  Give 'em a few more years I suppose.  All four films in the Saga are brilliant in their difference as much as their continuity, and I only look forward to a fifth entry.",10,1,6,10 February 2000
Alien: Resurrection," A lovely joke on Hollywood - viva Jeunet!
","Every time I perceive this marvelously disgusting, erotic, hilarious, and pretty film I enjoy it more than before.  Yet its undeniably different character from the first three films in the series begs addressing.  After my ninth screening, I propose that _Alien Resurrection_ is actually Situationist-influenced cinema.The essence of the 1950s-60s French-based Situationist movement is 'constructing situations' , a constructed situation defined as:'A moment of life, concretely and deliberately constructed by the collective organization of unitary environment and the free play of events.' --From the journal /Internationale Situationniste/ #1, June 1958
Of course that might describe every film ever made; the distinguishing factor methinks lies in both the character of the individual scenes, and their attitude toward the narrative.  The idea of 'constructing situations' includes the notion of free play of events in a carefully arranged environment.  As far as I can tell, the purpose is to break out of the Spectacular trance by appreciating life in an immediate, sensual way confounding to the intent of cultural or ideological scripts.  An example of Situationist-influenced daily life would be anarchists rearranging billboard messages to expose the advertiser's evil intent,  going out for a walk and intentionally getting lost, etc. In _Alien Resurrection_ , the scenes were the thing.  The scenes often seemed directionless, haphazard, the acting even a bit fake, as if a troupe of really good improvisation actors had been given a particular situation, setting, music, costumes, and roles, and were told to work out what would happen, stretching it out to fill a particular time.  The cinematography lends a glow to the surroundings, like an aura of meaningfulness, that prettifies everything.  The score undulates unpredictably, imbuing piecemeal *deja vu.   In other words, it's as if they have, in a Situationist sense, constructed various situations out of which beauty unfolds, and the actors themselves experience this necessarily.  Indeed, from the various actors' commentaries, describing, for instance, the vaunted underwater scene, or the thrill of working with famous actors in a celebrated film series, it seems as though it was as much if not more fun and interesting to actually act in it as it is to perceive it on the screen.  The final product proceeded without flowing, scenes appeared interchangeable, the plot primarily an excuse for generating a series of well-done Situations.  In doing so, it's natural the work dismantles the 'ideology' as it were of the first three films, and rearranges the elements to its own liking, for its own ends, in the service of situations.In this light, the disjointedness of the film becomes a focussing device, a hint of where not to look.  The joys of the film, as both apologists and reluctantly won over fans in varying degrees realise, flow from appreciating the various impressive situations, not from an elaborately engaging plot. Contrast with the intense, simple plot of A1, the well-rounded helping of plot and character in A2, and the muddling of both qualities for the sake of a well-stirred mood in A3.  Perhaps this degrades A4, or perhaps not.  If my proposition is correct, this not only paints the Alien Saga in a more subversive colour than hitherto appreciated, but also plays one of the largest jokes in cinematic history on the film studio that made it.  If _Alien3_ was a fifty-five million dollar art film, _Alien Resurrection_ must be nothing less than an eighty million dollar Situationist film. (!)  As such, of course, the title gains another significance...that of 'resurrecting' Situationist ideas into the popular imagination, nested within the heart of the spectacle itself.  If it's true that, in keeping with rumour, Jean-Pierre Jeunet will never make another Hollywood film, it's certainly no wonder why not!",10,3,7,5 April 2000
Cube," A smart, fun sci-fi gem, meriting repeat viewings.
","(MILD SPOILERS)It's Kafka gone high-tech, with a post-/Hellraiser/ sensibility to remind us that it means business.  Symbolically, it's easy to see that, in some way, the film is portraying us, the world, the technocracy that humans have unwittingly created for themselves.  The entire film takes place inside an artificial environment, out of control and functioning with mathematical precision.  No other film in the 1990's - the decade which saw science fiction become respectable - gives us such a simple yet colourful snapshot of contemporary technocratic life and fears.  Budget-wise it's in the same league as _The Blair Witch Project_ (i.e. under $2 million), made on a shoestring, with donated special effects and a home grown cast, snagging a Sundance award, and grossing relatively scads of money.  There aren't any explosions in it, or bullets; the pathos works, it's respectful of blood, and it looks pretty.  It feels like a sci-fi version of those 'Canadian Heritage' shorts in between tv commercials.  '...and first built in 1997, it's been running ever since.  The C.U.B.E.: A part of our heritage'. Enjoy the attractive characters, the surprises, and imagine your own chances inside the Cube.",10,0,1,19 February 2000
