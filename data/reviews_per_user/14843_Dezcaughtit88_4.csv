Casablanca," Casablanca Review
","Casablanca was one of the most beautifully filmed and acted and deserves to be considered one of the best movies of its era. The use of light in this film in showing the seriousness of the characters was very prevalent. It showed the uncertainty of the characters. As the story progresses we learn more and more about the characters pasts and after a while you start to think you know a character but, their motivations and intentions turn out to be different then originally thought. I enjoyed that aspect because it kept me on my toes. The acting was very very well done especially by Humphrey Bogart, his take on Rick Blaine was seemingly tough and hard to crack but as the movie continues we see his more emotional side and who he is as a person. Overall the film was very beautiful in its camera-work, acting, lighting, and even the sets and costumes. Definitely one of the best films of its time and also one of the best films in the history of American cinema.",9,0,2,9 March 2016
Annie Hall," Annie Hall Review
","This film is a landmark in film and is a classic that goes deep into the nature of relationships. Alvy and Annie are a odd and mismatched couple that butt heads at times but ultimately cared about each other very deeply. While this is well and good we begin to see the characters change and see how the relationship they have have affected them emotionally. We see them losing ambition, settling, getting comfortable, and unwilling to change even if it's for the best. This is true for many relationships today so this makes the story very relatable and funny. The chopped up story telling play a huge role on how we perceive the characters. We see one scene while they are together or another scene when they are broken up and this helps to show how the relationship has affected certain aspects of their lives so it's interesting to see how much love can affect who we are. Every aspect of this film from the camera work to the sound,and even some brief wacky moments thrown in make this a classic. It applies to the time it was filmed (1977) to today. This is a funny and brilliant way of expressing modern relationships and the idea of love and how it affects us on deep emotional levels.",9,0,0,4 May 2016
The Graduate," The Graduate Review
","This film is a fantastic piece of art that not only tugs on your heartstrings but also speaks volumes about the divide between the older generations and the younger generations. Many people of that time and even today can agree that older generations have a hard time understanding younger people and their interests. This theme is very apparent in the film and it makes one think about social progress and the role that younger people have played in it. In terms of the film itself Nichols does some very clever and beautiful things with the camera. He allows the viewer to not only observe the scenarios but also what the characters are thinking and struggling with. The acting by Hoffman is truly spectacular. He comes off as very awkward but this makes Ben come off as more relatable and funny. The soundtrack could've included more songs but the music that was in it worked very well. It made the movie very serious or very light hearted which made the scenes more emotionally captivating. All in all this film is a classic down to its core. It is a pure work of art that is beautifully filmed, scripted, and acted that deems this film as iconic.",10,1,1,3 May 2016
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction Review
","Words cannot describe the cleverness and artistry that is this film. Unconventional story telling, superb acting with in depth characters, over the top violence, and iconic interactions make this film a classic. The choppiness and disorder of the story can come off as confusing but once you begin to patch the scenes together you begin to truly understand the story. The dialogue is amazing, each interaction is beautifully written and acted and is also extremely thought provoking. While the movie is violent in nature their are many themes of religion and good vs. evil that make the story even more captivating. The clever use of close ups makes the characters more interesting and the dialogue more powerful. The acting by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, and Uma Thurman is all award worthy and elevates it from a movie to an experience. This is one of the most unique and artistic films ever created and each component from the camera work to the sounds and actions is beautifully executed.",10,0,1,3 May 2016
