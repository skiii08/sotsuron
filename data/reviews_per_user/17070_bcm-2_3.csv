The Blair Witch Project," Horror before move, but then disappointed. Why?
","Funny how a hype works. The less information I had about this movie, the eager I was.First I read the Dossier, second I listened to the CD, third I saw the movie.I´m a little disappointed about the 'kick' I had expected. It never come so boldly as the expectation due to the Dossier and the soundtrack.To be honest: the horror of the movie didn´t get me - the horror of the thoughts BEFORE the move did it.",Null,0,0,9 November 1999
The Fifth Element," ... but a cool kabuki of a hell of a story and scenes
","I really enjoyed this movie.No, it doesn´t help You in any questions concerning how to run Your life, You can´t draw any real sense off it and of cause You must not see this movie.But if You leave all that behind and want a real entertaining space opera, give it a try.I was sceptical at first... ... but it blew my mind. 5th element handles it´s story easy as You slice cheese - it´s simply run through it.It´s joyful, cheerish, ironically, entertaining. But also a bit romantic, uneven, playful futuristic and emotional.In the end You have to decide  for yourself: if You don´t expect a meaningful and serious movie but a cool kabuki of a hell of a story and scenes You must see it.",Null,0,1,19 February 2000
Event Horizon," Watch this movie around midnight and enjoy the thrills
","(I have watched the german and the english version of Event Horizon.)This movie is incredible and gave my thrills like no other movie before.In style it's more like 'Haunted House to the Stars' - but the whole concept fits perfectly (the movie has some errors, though, but I remember some cult movies [Blade Runner, I like Icarus, etc.] with errors -  so I leave these fauxes behind).The story and characters are well build, placed in the matching environment and developing the scary mood of this motion picture. The ever so unlikely space ships 'Lewis and Clark' and the 'Event Horizon' providing the different sets, one comfortable and cozy, the other harsh and dark. In fact the abandoned 'Event Horizon' design shows church elements and don't deny it's inquistive destiny...If you like scary movies with a science fiction touch watch this movie around midnight alone in a deserted room, better house. Enjoy your thrills.",Null,1,2,24 November 2001
