10 Cloverfield Lane," Excellent addition
","For me Cloverfield is an amazing movie (it's in my top 100 movies) so this had a lot to live up to,This is the second time watching 10 Cloverfield Lane, the first time I watched it at the cinema enjoying every second of a 'Misery - 1990 movie' type story unfolded,by the end of the film I had mixed emotions, one being 'wow that was great' and two thinking 'what has that got to do with the first movie' as I was expecting a massive monster, but still left the cinema thinking it was a great movie but I had lots of questions,Watching this the second time and having some of the questions answered I sat back and enjoyed the great story and the awesome acting from Winstead, she absolutely nailed her character as did Goodman.Well worth a watch",7,0,0,7 October 2019
It," Sorry for no Curry but we all float down here
","Watching this for the second time made me appreciate how good it actually is and love it even more, Bill Skarsg√°rd absolutely nails it as Pennywise, He sent a chill on the back of my neck every time he appears,The young lads do an amazing job giving us this 'Stand by Me' chemistry,From start to finish I watched this with a big smile on my face.A must watch.",8,1,1,7 October 2019
A Quiet Place," Loud and proud
","Think I've just found my new Cloverfield, what a great movie, I've just left the cinema buzzing, this was excellent.For a movie that doesn't have hardly any dialogue the actors smashed it, amazing performance from all of them, if they didn't have bad luck they wouldn't have any.I absolutely loved this, it's more intense then a camping holiday I was literally on the edge of my seat watching it, excellent story with some of the best Badass creepy alien/creature type things I've seen since Alien and Cloverfield.The whole time watching this not one person talked or made a sound which is very rare now days, I left the cinema with a massive smile on my face and can't wait to see it again.",8,1,3,7 October 2019
Saw," Set the mold
","Two strangers, who awaken in a room with no recollection of how they got there, soon discover they're pawns in a deadly game perpetrated by a notorious serial killer.There is a reason this is one of my all time favorite horrors, everything about it is spot on, it's an absolute masterpiece,I've lost count how many times I've seen it now but every time I watch it I'm left with a massive smile on my face and despite knowing how it ends I'm still left shocked,I remember watching it for the first time and knowing it was a breath of fresh air the the horror genre, I love the pace of it and how all these mad crazy stories lead to one amazingly clever story, the gore and sick traps went beyond anything we was used to and set a bench make for horror as we know it.",9,0,3,7 October 2019
