Antz," enough action for the mind of kids and adults
","This is typical Woody New Yorker Allen.  If you don't like the other movies by the jazz player, you can be assured this movie puts him at his best for choosing a great score to go along with his analysis. As a matter of fact I think the score saves the  movie from falling into a Saturday morning cartoon special or the old Woody Allen squabblings with his analyst or Diane Keaton. The characters voices were lost to my cotton plugged ears (I saw in one of these maxi-somethings.) It would be acceptable for biology 6 (elementary school for normal children's curriculum).Thus I rated ot 6.A.C. Gonzalez",5,0,1,11 October 1998
Shakespeare in Love," Even Elizabeth I and A.L. Rouse would love this one!
","Shakespeare, the terror of High School students, turns into Shakespeare the man. Instead of the 'balding bard,' we meet the dashing actor with wife and mistresses. Instead of equivocating about the nebulous Dark Lady of the Sonnets, we get to meet her 'in the flesh' (well, almost in the flesh.) .We hear the stage, get to visit with Queen E., have a bar-visit with Christopher Marloe, and, lots of fun with Willy Shakespeare and the boys. Not to mention hearing beautiful recitations of our beloved poetry, excellent acting, and the music! Ah the music that comes free with this beautiful play. (We even get to know Elizabezan mice! Never expected it!)This is a fantasy in good taste and done with unusual imagination: poetic scholarship at is best.",10,0,0,10 January 1999
Saving Private Ryan," what else is new about war?
","Yes, I am a veteran also, of a less glorifies war. I also found Saving Private Ryan not very interesting.  The movie moved at Wagnerian pace. Many times I thought of walking out, mostly out of sheer boredom. I kept dreaming of scissors! Oh! how I wished they cut the balcony scene between the French parents-girl-and soldiers; it wasn't even in good taste. ('Let's walk out now!' I told my family---'but wait you'll be dragging a loss of nearly $20.00, let's stay, we'll cut it to pieces during supper!')  And the dialogue: how many war movies did they cut-and-paste to come up with such witticisms as 'I don;t give a blankety blank about this blankety war...I want to go . home...'And my  most favorite quotation: ' all these men dead for one man!'  In summary I've seen dozens of more interesting and truly more representative war movies.My summary of the movie, is 'what else is new.!' You don't have to go digging into the annals of history for carnage. Reserve your seat at your local hospital emergency room on any Saturday night!I didn't learn much from this movie, perhaps nothing at all. And goodness, how long it was!",6,0,0,7 September 1998
