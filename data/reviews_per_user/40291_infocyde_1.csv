The New World," Very Slow
","This movie has two things going for it. The costumes were pretty cool, and the breath taking panoramic views of the landscapes were nice. Thus I gave it 2 stars for each of those, plus I'll toss in another star because it has a lot of decent actors in the movie. Other than that, I watched most of the movie on 2x or 4x to speed it along, and it still evolved to slow for me. You could condense the whole movie into about a 45 minutes. This is a shame, because there was potential here. There were many talented actors here who just stood around looking at the sky or wondering around, which was a waste of their talents. The movie did pick up towards the end a little bit, but getting there was a little bit painful. Honestly, unless you have a real affinity for the production staff, an actor in the movie, or the time period, I would pass this one by.",5,0,4,27 June 2006
