The Monuments Men," Good night and no luck
","George Clooney's latest film tells a long-forgotten story: In the last phase 0of World War II, a group of art experts set up by the U.S. Army went on search for stolen and hidden art in order to rescue them from destruction or being transported to the Soviet Union. Clooney himself plays Frank Stokes, leader of these 'Monuments Men', the cast includes the likes of Matt Damon, Caste Blanchett as well as, for the comic relief, Bill Murray and John Goodman. The film is strong when it comes to capturing the look of the times, whether it be occupied Paris or the battle fields of France, Belgium and Germany. This is where its strengths end. Driven by an unbearably obtrusive score, The Monuments Men is pure Hollywood at its very worst. The dialogue is bland and clichéd, the screenplay as if from a construction kit with all the dramatic turns, humorous interludes and romantic anecdotes a blockbuster needs, the photography completely unimaginative, the acting reduced to the purely routine. While the story is one that needs to be told, Clooney chooses the most unsatisfying way of telling it that could be imagined, making the film so slick and uninteresting it should not even do well at the box office. http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",2,11,16,20 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Life in a nutshell
","There are some who say that the most important part of a film is its ending. Examples of films which have been all but destroyed by the way they end are legion. Much rarer are the cases of films that really come into their own at the very end. Luckily, Captain Phillips, based on the much publicized case of the 2009 hijacking of an American cargo ship off the Somalian coast, is part of the latter, considerably smaller group. After his rescue, Phillips (Tom Hanks in his strongest performance in years) is taken in by highly efficient and well-trained Navy personnel who perform routine checks, ask routine questions, follow routine protocol. Phillips, however, who we have just watched for two hours working like a well-oiled survival machine, a master at adapting to any change of situation, a great tactician and relentless fighter, has turned into a zombie-like shell: words fail him, simple movements and motions become impossibly complicated. The puzzled bewilderment, the gaping hole the instinct to survive has left, contrast drastically with the self-congratulatory air of everyone else to who this has just been a successful operation. To Phillips, this is his life.And so the ever-moving hand-held camera, efficiently industrious, full of unchecked energy clashes with the image of a soul that has come to a brutal halt, a personal world that has stopped turning, a heart that has skipped a beat. And all of a sudden, the same look that has just been supportive and empathic is now voyeuristic, indecent, intrusive. For the well-made thriller has revealed something existential, something essential to human nature. A primal fear and helplessness that we are so good at covering up. This ending, this emptying face will remain when everything else about this film has disappeared. And there is quite a lot to this. For the previous two hours Captain Phillips has been a gripping thriller, a claustrophobic clash of human desires and fears and needs whose space grows ever tighter: from two separate locations to a ship, a bridge, a cellar-like engine room to a tiny closed lifeboat that looks grotesquely pathetic compared to the war machinery the Navy has brought.Yet inside, all of human drama takes place: there's power and powerlessness, brutality and fear, despair and hope, the first world and the third, all enclosed in literally, a nutshell. And pretty evenly distributed among the hijackers and the victims, the guilty and the innocent. There is no black or white, only the gray, the pale, ghost- like hue of the indifferent sea and sky, a vast unthinking universe in which life is merely an afterthought. They have to deal with each other: the confident, experience, smart Phillips and the aggressive, skinny, helpless Muse (Barkhad Abdi in a haunting, memorable performance). Two lost souls whose final bewilderment in the face of deadly efficiency reveals them as inhabitants of the same planet without unduly shifting guilt. Yes, the highjacker turned kidnapper is guilty, yes he is a criminal deserving of punishment, but first and foremost, he is human, just like his prisoner. There are no monsters in this battle of wills in which both are pawns as well as actors, swept around by the tides while taking responsibility and making decisions.The camera is always close, hardly ever still, reflecting the hectic twists and turns of this duel, this frantic battle to survive. Captain Phillips thrives on Paul Greengrass' excellent direction, his impeccable timing, the documentary-like camera work, the hypnotic rhythm and gripping editing, the clear, pale, matter-of-factly imagery. Yes, it is a thriller and a highly efficient one. But it is one that moves from outward suspense to inner drama, just as the space narrows the inner battles come to the forefront. No matter if captain or crew or kidnappers: in the end, they all want to survive, their own worst enemy is fear. Which is ultimately the film's chief protagonist: Captain Phillips is a film about fear, about what it does to people, no matter on what side of the processes that create the fear they appear to be. Its destructive force as well as its ability to bring out a strength hitherto unsuspected, have never been more visible, its angels and devils never clearer, the key role it plays in all of human existence, never been more obvious. And its power to be at its strongest when it seems to have been overcome. It may be paralyzing, shutting down all normal processes, putting existence on stand-by. Yet it will reboot, Phillips will go to sea again, Muse will find a way to survive, to continue. And so will we. Not less fearful, but, maybe, just a tiny little bit wiser.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",9,1,3,19 March 2014
Gravity," The human quest
","The blue planet: At the beginning of Gravity, the earth moves slowly into view, inhabiting a dark, silent universe. The silence is broken by faint radio communication that gradually grows louder as a space shuttle appears, first as a dot, then slowly growing larger. It is a long, slow, quiet opening sequence that sets the stage for Alfonso Cuarón's latest film. Three astronauts are doing some repair work on the Hubble telescope, the focus is on seasoned commander Matthew Kowalsky (George Clooney) and scientist Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). The atmosphere is loose: Kowalsky tells funny stories and plays country music, Stone is focused on her work, when suddenly a Russian missile meant to destroy a disused satellite caused a chain reaction: debris from countless satellites and other objects turns into missiles destroying the shuttle and sending Kowalsky and stone on a lone quest to survive - alone in space. A nightmarish scenario and yet not one entirely implausible. Debris is more and more clogging then earth's orbit, attempts at getting rid of things in space manifold and often short-sighted. This is one theme of the film, coupled with the human hubris of controlling nature – or, in this case, the entire universe. On the other hand, Gravity is a tale of human perseverance, of the strength the will to live can instill, and also of the power of human sacrifice.Little of this is new, yet the way Cuarón tells his story is entirely his own, even though he quotes extensively from science fiction classics such as Andrey Tarkovsky's Solaris (Clooney also starred in Stephen Soderbergh's remake) or Stanley Kubrick's 2001 – a Space Odyssey. The sense of aimless drifting, of losing control is there, as is the feeling of loneliness in a hostile infinity. As in Kubrick's masterpiece, technology is friend and foe alike, rescue and damnation employ the same instruments. It is Gravity's strength that there is no overt criticism in man's often blind belief in the value of technology, his hubris to be the master of the universe he knows. Yet it is all there: in the hypnotic imagery, the startled faces, the toy-like fragility of these technological masterpieces we have sent spinning around our planet. In all this, the human is as vulnerable as ever. When Stone reaches the assumed safe haven of the International Space Station (ISS), we see her floating in a fetal position in front of the circular airlock. This is, of course, a nod to 2001 (as is the opening sequence), but it is also a powerful image of human vulnerability. Stripped of all technological support, the human being is naked and helpless.But it is also a rebirth: Stone, relying on training and countless gadgets, is entirely at a loss when unexpected disaster strikes. She has to battle her fears and face her demons before she can believe in a chance to survive. Sandra Bullock is impressive in her portrayal of this broken, hurt, desperate yet stubborn woman, who is, as we all are, groping along alone in eternal darkness. Her character is given her power by Kowalsky who shows her what humans are capable of doing for each other. Only then does she start believing in herself. Gravity takes much of its power from this combination of survivor story and meditatively philosophical science fiction tale. Man's hubris fails, but the will to survive remains. This is the key difference to Solaris and 2001: Cuarón chooses to believe in the human strength, in humanity's ability to change – one self and one's course on earth and within our universe.Gravity has its very own pace, the pace of zero gravity, of floating in a vast, infinite and ultimately hostile space. A space in which the elaborate constructions humanity has built seem ridiculous, like badly made toys, which cannot protect but surely have the ability to destroy. The camera is floating along with the objects and protagonists, it moves in and out, often films the faces though their visors, then suddenly moves inside the helmet. Space is vast and unintelligible, yet for those lost in it it is a narrow, claustrophobic room as they are caught in the prison of human ambition. When – in accordance with physics – a space station explodes without a sound, this is a powerful reminder of our place in the universe.The elementary fear and despair is always present: in the darkness of space, the cold emptiness of the technological contraptions, the clean, anti-septic images, whose polished surface reveals an unfeeling, indifferent universe – the real one as the man-made one – in which being human is impossibly hard. That it affirms the validity of trying despite the odds, is one of the film's strongest points, as is the repeated, yet never obvious reminder of what it is we have to fight for: earth's beauty is shown as vulnerable, fragile, fleeting, yet overwhelming. While the musical score is at times superfluous, the story-lines occasionally to well-composed, the ending a little far-fetched, Gravity is a powerful reminder of the possibilities and limits of human aspiration, critical of human hubris and affirmation of humanity's strength. A hypnotic, mesmerizing and ultimately hopeful film that will prove hard to forget.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",9,14,22,25 February 2014
The Hunger Games," Bread and Games
","As a series of novels, The Hunger Games is a phenomenon. Its premise could hardly be more violent, more brutal, more cynical more inhumane: As a punishment for a long forgotten rebellion against a totalitarian state that has long replaced the United States as we know them today, but more importantly as entertainment for the rich, privileged and bored, 24 children and teenagers between the ages of 12 and 18 are forced to slaughter each other until only one remains. Yet the series has become a huge success among younger readers, rivalling that of the Harry Potter or the Twilight books. And it is threatening to do the same on the big screen: Even measured against the giant expectations, the first film has been a huge success. And all this without holding anything back, with a bleak, unforgiving, completely anti-escapist view of the world. The Hunger Games is a frighteningly honest defense of humanity that is heavy on its destructive, merciless, selfish side as well as a stinging indictment of today's media culture. For the 'Hunger Games' are nothing other than excellent 'Reality TV' brought to its logical conclusion.The film centers around Katniss, a tough teenage girl acting as the surrogate mother for her little sister and takes her place when the latter is picked in the lottery that determines the 'games'' participants. Jennifer Lawrence has proved in Winter's Bone that she can carry her film with her strength, her truthfulness, her complete and utter believability and she does so again here. Her Katniss is a young girl grown before her time, stubborn, angry, harsh. She has built a protective shell around her which hides her vulnerability and fears. She is forced to be brave, she has no choice but she is only human and she remains so.One of the film's aspect is a carefully told coming of age story as Katniss finds her inner strength without losing her compassion and the fear that makes her human. Accepting no advice at first she learns to trust others, to forge alliances, to play the game. First and foremost, she learns how to survive: from her fellow combatant Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is much faster on the uptake and sheds his pride more easily to do what needs to be done or from her jaded, hard-drinking but ultimately decent mentor (Woody Harrelson). As the 'games' advance she understand she needs to become part of the game and walk the thin line between accepting the necessary and staying true to herself. Peeta is more easily willing to give up his pride but he never loses side of his primary goal: Even if he must die, he wants to remain himself even in death. Play the game if you must but remain the player not just the pawn the others see in you. On the other side are those competitors who have been trained for years to do this, who don't know anything else than kill. They have been stripped of their souls, turned into sad figures for whom death is delivery from a life they lost long ago.For a film targeted at a younger audience, The Hunger Games paints a surprisingly honest picture of the mechanisms of totalitarianism. It is not just the cruel spectacle itself, it is the discrepancy between the comic-like splendour of the ruling 'Capitol' and the oppressed, starving 12 district, the use of spectacle to build a fake community, to distract as well as scare, to keep the people from thinking from themselves. Donald Sutherland gives a chilling performance as the perfectly Machiavellian president. It is the trusted Roman concept of 'panem et circenses', bread and games with a good measure of fear thrown in. The most important task is to keep people to think for themselves. Distracting them, making them focus on feeding their families, keeping them afraid of what will happen if they step out of line are mechanisms employed by dictators all over the world and throughout history and they are used and shown here.In addition, The Hunger Games is also a biting and disturbing satirical unmasking of the workings of television and other means to manipulate the masses. What might seem harmless enough in our society can only too easily be made to serve any purpose at all. The 'games' are first and foremost brilliant entertainment, gripping, full of suspense and nail- biting intensity, a perfectly produced TV show personified in Stanley Tucci's unsettlingly excellent showmaster. More than once the audience find themselves the the role of the spectator, drawn into voyeurist mode, enjoying this a little too much. It is the basic principle of the ancient gladiator battles as well as today's 'Reality TV'. Others' suffering is our entertainment, their humiliation or triumph. There is something thoroughly totalitarian in this and the film does a great job at showing this, giving the viewer an uneasy feeling about being entertained.There is much more to be said: about the skillful use of the hand-held camera to convey the fear, the the horror, the stark reality behind the entertainment, the fact that people are paying the ultimate price for others to have fun; the frightening realism which never make one feel this to be a distant future; the brilliant cast that fills these characters with more life than we can handle. The Hunger Games may cater to the same market as Twilight and the like, but it does not play in the same league, it does not even play the same game. Director Gary Ross has turned Suzanne Collins' novel into a gripping film which makes no compromises and does not spare the audience. And they still love it. Maybe Hollywood has underestimated their audience in the past? It can only be hoped the message is not lost.",9,0,5,29 March 2012
Argo," No Heroes
","The plot of Argo is so crazy and unbelievable that it must be true. In order to get six US diplomats hiding in the Canadian ambassador's residence out of Teheran, the CIA set up a fake film company, publicize the production of a fake film and send an agent into Iran who tries to smuggle the six out under the pretense of being a location scout team. Ben Affleck directed the film and he plays Tony Mendez, the real CIA man behind this ultimately successful operation. Argo is not a tale of heroism, it is a tale of professionals doing their job. His Tony is a serious, realistic man who knows the risks but is also aware that this is their best chance, as crazy as the idea sounds. Argo allows the viewer deep insights into the bureaucracy, the envy and power games, the lack of reality, a power apparatus like the CIA brings with it. Yet, it never condemns or exaggerates. This is, after all, a bureaucratic organization and within that framework, these people are trying to do what is best. The scenes within the CIA are one highlight of the film, those inside the ambassador's residence in which Mendez and the six refugees struggle with themselves and each other about whether they can and should take the risk, are the other.Argo is a film about people under pressure, humans in a state of emergency trying to figure out and do what is right. These scenes as well as the one in which the fake location scouts visit a Teheran bazar are of an almost unbearable intensity, driven by a painfully close, increasingly unsettling camera which captures and mirrors the threat of people unravelling, fearing for their lives. In these moments, Affleck gives the film an almost documentary feel, plunging the viewer right into the scene as it happens. But Argo is also a very cleverly constructed thriller in which the suspense rises almost imperceptibly until the audience are suddenly right on the edges of their seats, hardly knowing how they got there. Affleck does a great job letting the story breathe, never artificially heightening the tension, allowing it to organically grow from the existential threat under which these people live. Adding a wonderful subtle little Hollywood satire, perfectly enacted by the fake filmmakers Alan Arkin and John Goodman, Argo is a memorably film about normal people surviving under pressure, in which good and bad are still a little too easy to differentiate.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com",8,0,3,21 March 2013
Midnight in Paris," The golden age might be right now
","Film is a strange medium. No matter how hard it tries to pretend to be part of our present or conform with our sense of time – at the end of the day, film is always a thing of the past. Whatever we see on the screen has already happened and is gone. The filmic presence is a pretended one, it is the presence of what is no longer there. A similar thing happens with time: Time on film is a very fluid thing. It can slow down and speed up, jump back and forth, be linear or run in circles. And sometimes it even defies all our attempts at grasping it, becoming an ever-changing floating entity that is never what it seems. Yet the physical presence of the moving images gives that elusive thing, time, a presence no other art can claim. Time is a toy for film to play with. In this sense (and in many others), Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a film about time in film, or rather about time, exploring it in a way only film can.Gil Pender is a man of the past. Not that he has the best behind him but for everything he does his inspiration lies in the past. He dreams of a golden age which for him were the 1920, especially the Paris of the 1920. The contrast between this dreamer and the world of the here and now is clear right from the start. The lost glance, the wide eyes, the constant sense of him not really being there – Owen Wilson does not need much, a glance here, a delayed movement there, to convey the sense of someone fallen out of time. He the hectic yet meandering totally Allenesque style of speaking, those words constantly chasing themselves, with an almost trancelike perception, an elliptic interaction with the world. This 'real world'is chiefly represented by his fiancé played almost painfully ordinarily by Rachel McAdams. The mundane, the pseudo- intellectual, the snobistic and utilitarian is overdone a little, yet she still serves as a good foil to Wilson's denial of what is widely regarded as real.Yet it is the real and unreal, the present and the past which come to unravel, swap places and becoming all part of a larger reality which is that of film. Suddenly Gil who dreams of his personal golden age, finds himself in the middle of it. When he gets lost in Paris and midnight strikes he gets a lift from a party in an old 1920s cars and suddenly he is right in that period. He meets Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Man Ray, Picasso, Cole Porter, has his novel read by Gertrud Stein, his relationship analysed by Hemingway and suggests film ideas to Bunuel. And, of course he falls in love. With Picasso's lover who used to be with Modigliani and Braque and , finding out that Gil is engaged, runs off with Hemingway to Africa. Marion Cotillard plays her with fragile purity for she is a dreamer, too. Her golden age is the Paris of the belle époque and when they end up there, she decides to stay.Gil, however, returns and Allen allows him (and us) a hint he might have found a soul mate right in the present. For despite all the nostalgia, it's here we must live, as Woody Allen well knows. But nonetheless, the past, the real as well as the imagined, can be as much a part of our present as dreams can roll into our reality. Maybe, our lives can be a little fuller if we allow them to be a little more than film and accept that time can be more than one thing, past and present, linear and circular, constant and ever-changing. A fairy tale that only Allen can get away with and a film about the power of the imagination and the possibility that our golden age might be just now. If only we could see it.",Null,0,1,24 October 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The thinking man's Bond
","Welcome to the Circus! There are no acrobats here, no clowns, no happy children. Just a bunch of dreary and boring bureaucrats juggling nothing less than the fate of the earth. It probably takes a film like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to understand how much our view of the world – and the work – of intelligence services has been contaminated by the glamorous universe of James Bond or his modern, more disillusioned but even more heroic, counterpart Jason Bourne. So we've come to expect a world of action and heroism, of right versus wrong, of shady backroom dealings and deadly plots which are opposed by a few brave and righteous men. The are backrooms and intrigue, there is plenty of violence and a few righteous men here, too. But there is no glamour, no heroism, no glory. This is not a game, this is dead serious and reminds us how, just a few years ago – and in many ways still today – this was where the frontline ran in a relentless though largely invisible war, a war fought in the place of a 'real' one which nobody wanted to fight because it could not be won. This was never about heroics, this was all about survival.Director Tomas Alfredson creates – or recreates – a world paralysed by fear, a world which might explode at any moment, in which laughable chess players clumsily try to avoid what seems inevitable. The film takes place in the 1960s, at a time when common sense had it that this earth was doomed, that there would be a nuclear war which would extinguish the world we have come to know. This pale, grey, claustrophobic world seems already dead, almost devoid of color, covered in a sickly greenish grey that has sucked all life from it.This world's James Bond is called George Smiley, but smile he hardly ever does. He is a grey-haired, stone-faced middle-aged man whose life is over, having lost his top job at MI6 as well as his wife. He is yesterday's man, a relic from a time in which integrity counted for something. Now it is all a game, a struggle for power in which the frontlines are hardly visible and ever shifting. Gary Oldman is Smiley and he gives one of the most memorable performances of his career. There is hardly any discernible movement in his stern face, reading it is like reading between lines and yet all the film happens right there, in those minuscule movements, the slight clouding and unclouding of those unforgiving features. A hard man in hard times for which he is much better equipped than the arrogant narcissists which regard themselves as modern.Smiley was forcefully retired but is brought back to lead a secret operation aimed at discovering a mole at the highest level of the 'Circus'. Instead of embarking on an action-filled hunt, Smiley hides in a seedy hotel room, studying mountains of documents. This is a bureaucrats' war and it can only be won by a master bureaucrat. And it is won by talking, investigating, thinking, drawing conclusions – and, most importantly, by listening and observing. There is very little movement in this film which mostly takes place in narrow, suffocating rooms, whether it is Smiley's dusty makeshift headquarters, the dreary grey corridors of the 'Circus' or the antiseptic chilliness of the board room. The film opens with an operation going horribly wrong in Budapest but this war is fought in backrooms. So it is fitting that it's final, completely nonviolent and mostly silent showdown takes place in a dark empty house.This is the ultimate Anti-Bond: serious, honest, unglamorous, unheroic. For this war is very real and it is not glamorous at all. The methods employed by the two sides are the same and vary only in their level of professionalism. But there is more: Incredulously, Smiley tells the story of once meeting the Soviet Union's top spy who chose to return home expecting to be executing in Stalin's reign of terror rather than defect to the West. Smiley cannot understand this ideological fanaticism which he regards as the Russian's only weakness. He is a pragmatist, for him it is not about ideology but sheer survival. There is no room for grand ideas when you're balancing the edge of an abyss. It takes no hero not to fall, it takes a bureaucrat.Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a masterpiece of a spy thriller, full of suspense in which the violence is always dirty, never heroic or glorified. It is a claustrophobic, bloodless world it depicts which has no place for heroism, a world in which no games are played and where right and wrong are no moral categories, although it does not deny the value of decency. The political field on which these shadow armies move is no colorful background, it is deadly reality. In the very end, there is a slight smile on Smiley's face, a brief sign of triumph which cannot hide the fact that nothing is over because it never is. Time to go to work.",9,0,0,23 March 2012
Life of Pi," With Eyes Wide Open
","Taiwanese-born Ang Lee is one of the world's most most celebrated filmmakers – and one of its most innovative and influential ones. He is also the creator of an oeuvre as various and multi-faceted as that of no other filmmaker alive. Lee revolutionized martial arts film with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, he pushed the doors wide open for gay topics in Hollywood with Brokeback Mountain, he did blockbuster action cinema (Hulk) and atmospherically dense family drama (The Ice Storm). Lee is a filmmaker who can create imagery that sticks with everyone who has seen and experienced it. He creates worlds as unique as they are credible and true. If cinema is a place for the imagination to roam, Lee is the master guide. Who else could take on the seemingly hopeless task of turning Yann Martel's world bestseller Life of Pi, about an Indian boy who survives a shipwreck in a lifeboat with a tiger, into a film? Ang Lee could and he did and again he created something that will have a lasting effect on film.Life of Pi was shot in state-of-the art 3D technology but even for those who view it in 2D, it will open their eyes, showing things never seen before. Life of Pi is a miracle, a film in which the majority of its story happens on a drifting boat in the middle of the ocean with only a teenage boy and a Bengal tiger present. The film is at its heart a very intimate story confined to the narrowest of settings. Yet again Ang Lee proves to be a master of story-telling who narrates in the language he speaks best: that of film. Lee speaks of joy and grief, of hope and desperation and, not unimportantly, of the search for a truth larger than the individual.This Pi is a seeker of spiritual truths. As a child, he is a Hindu, a Christian and a Muslim, all at the same time. When the storm hits the ship he is travelling on, he embraces it as a message from God. He will again and again call God and keep believing that there is a higher power watching him. For him, it might well have been this power that sent him a tiger as travelling companion, the tiger he will credit with saving his life for if he did not have to be constantly alert he might never have made it. His God, no doubt, moves in mysterious ways and isn't this what wise men say about life?19-year-old first-time actor Suraj Sharma plays Pi and he does so with a truly unforgettable mixture of wide-eyed wonder, relentless will of survival and this questioning look in his eyes that wants to know what make this world continue. His is a hopeful story of one who has lost everything but his sense of wonder at this world.And yet, there is so much more to this visually stunning masterpiece. Because Pi, hungry for life and knowledge, is no match for the viewer who cannot keep their eyes off for even a second, who stare wide-eyed at this world which they never have seen this way. At times the limits between sky and sea seem to disappear, the boat to float on thin air, water, land, sea all become one. we look at the sky from under water or see the sunken ship and all the ocean looking in. When Pi, diving, watches the brightly lighted ship sink, he seems suspended in a vacuum- like state, time stops, past, present, future become one.It is a sense of time we know from fairy-tales – and from dreams. And after all, aren't we all dreaming, isn't Pi? For what is real? The tiger in the boat next to his makeshift raft? The fluorescent whale who almost turns the boat over? The carnivorous floating island full of meerkats? Like Alice in Wonderland we follow Pi from one miracle to the next, floating along as if in a dream. Suspending belief and time and logic.Life of Pi is so many things at once: a growing-up story and a tale of perseverance, a survivor's story with an unlikely hero whose will to live paired with a natural resourcefulness of the imagination makes him continue. And it is the story of the unlikeliest of friendships which, of course, is nothing more (or less) than the bond of two creatures understanding that they need the other for survival. It is a quest for truth, a truth which resides in the human heart as well as in his brain, which requires reason and the ability to believe. But Life of Pi is also a film about the power of images – to educate, to amaze, to scare but also to question. For what is real, what is a dream and is there even a difference?And perhaps above all, it is about the power of story-telling. In the end, we will be asked to doubt what we have been told and seen and be left with the option to just believe. When we are young, we first encounter the world and its ways through fairy-tales, incredible stories which we believe and don't believe at the same time but which make us grow and learn and wonder. Life of Pi is such a story and, at the same time, it shows us how such stories work. It is, in one word, nothing but a miracle.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",10,0,2,20 January 2013
American Hustle," Empire of greed
","New York City, 1978: Irving (Christian Bale) is a con man: cunning, smart enough and aware of how far he can go. In Sydney (Amy Adams) he has found a partner who can take his efficiency to the next level. Until FBI agent Richard (Bradley Cooper) turns up and threatens to bust their lucrative fraud business. So they agree to help him catch bigger fish so he can let them go. And off goes a ride that will see politicians busted, the mafia getting involved, relationships and marriages shattered, dreams destroyed and others transformed. In David O. Russell's film, everyone cons everyone else, he unleashes such a whirlwind of greed and hubris and treachery and sheer survival instinct that not only the viewer's head starts spinning but with it the entire film. The film is set in a grotesque 1970s universe that is absurdly exaggerated as it is atmospherically true. American Hustle is human comedy and Greek tragedy, brightly colored comic strip and panoramic tableau of an era, absurd caricature and warmly colored character tale. Everything is way over the top and down to earth, wildly ridiculous and stunningly realistic at the same time, a wild and colorful feast of a film that has the addictive power – and look – of an excellent narcotic, the embarrassingly inescapable pull of an orgy that goes way too far but which one cannot stop. Christian Bale is breath-taking as Irving, overweight, full of swagger and even fuller of fear, Cooper turns the ambitious out-of-control cop into a truly scary figure, Adams walks the thin line between deep vulnerability and excessive self-confidence. But the film's true miracle is Jennifer Lawrence as Irving' wife: desperate, hysterical, full of fear and a vague longing that explodes into one of the most screwed up characters in film history. American Hustle shows – and makes the audience feel – what happens when greed, personal desires and inferiority complexes react. It is like a weird psychedelic trip that leaves you confused. And happy.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",10,1,7,20 February 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Damaged Goods
","No, this man clearly isn't fine. He's not OK or alright or anything. He's a time bomb certain to explode. He doesn't look, he glares. The face is a tightly fitted mask that hardly manages to hold in check what' trying to come out. The words about being positive and getting his life back together are well-learned phrases which clash violently with the language of his face. He's learned all the self-help lingo and he's well-versed in the speech of pharmaceuticals. And that's all that's needed to declare him fit enough to go back into the real world – at least with a little persuasion from his mother. Silver Linings Playbook is a remarkably open as well as funny portrayal of a misfit, a man diagnosed bipolar after almost killing the man his wife cheated him with. And it is a warm-hearted comedy about broken people and society's way of dealing with them, containing several jibes at America's obsession with both the self-help hype as well as psychotropic drugs. For among other things, this is also a satire on America's belief that there are easy answers for ever problem. Give an obsessive and angry man a few drugs and a positive life motto, and all will be well. but it isn't, as Bradley Cooper's tight face tells us right away.Silver Lining Playbook also deals with the need for people to function. Society's biggest problem with Pat Solitano is that he isn't properly functioning, that he doesn't respond to crises in the expected way, that he cannot or will not control himself. The same is true for Tiffany (Jennfer Lawrence) who Pat meets at dinner at a friend's house. She responded to the death of her husband by sleeping with every man at her company. Again she was outcast, diagnosed as depressive, not functional. There is a wonderful scene when Pat and Tiffany discus various psycho drugs and their side effects. All these easy solutions they are nothing but a joke. A sad one though because it can destroy people's lives.Of course, nothing is simple. Pat is not cured and despite a restriction order is convinced he will get back together with his wife. Things do not go smoothly and the time bomb goes off repeatedly as demonstrated when his psychiatrist plays his wedding song which he associates with his wife's cheating and all that followed. It does not take a second to unleashed a Hulk-like anger in Pat. All this therapy, all those drugs have not deactivated the time bomb, quite to the contrary. They have giving him a disguise in which to wrap himself up and disguise his true nature, pretending he has learned how to function again.Instead, the film celebrates the dysfunctional. There is Pat's father (Robert De Niro), an illegal bookkeeper and football fan who has been banned from the stadium for violent behavior. There is Pat's best friend who dreams of breaking out of his marriage. There is fellow-patient Danny, a hair-obsessed volatile bundle of joy. And there is Tiffany, brutally honest just like Pat, who falls for him quickly and tries to break his shell and tear him away from his obsession with his wife.This is where the film works: How the distant and rejecting Pat allows Tiffany into his life, if only as a useful tool to communicate with his wife. How Tiffany craves to find someone to be near her, someone to understand her, someone not only a sex partner. Their slowly developing relationship with its many ups and downs, with funny twists and turns and unsettling breakdowns is what turns the film into one of the better ones this year. Russell gives them time, allows them long periods without word, where looks and their avoidance, where his rigid posture and her uncertain walk speak louder than any dialogue could. These are 'damaged goods' slowly moving into a mutual comfort zone in which they are not judged on the basis of whether thy function or not but from which they can be ejected – or from which they can eject themselves – at any time.So far so good but unfortunately, Silver Linings Playbook, later falls into the trap of becoming itself what it set out criticizing. For Russell finds an easy and painfully simple answer: With the help of a dance competition, Pat ends up falling in love with Tiffany and in the end all is well and everybody is happy. All problems are solved by love and understanding and so the film ends in the most disappointing of happy endings, turning into a shallow romantic comedy and throwing everything over board that made the film interesting in the first place. So instead of drugs and self-help strategies, the film's happy ending suggests love as a cure for all. The drugs don't work so let#s get another one. To state that the film's resolution was disappointing would be an understatement.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/2013/01/26/damaged-goods/",7,0,1,26 January 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Riding the bull
","The contrast could hardly be any greater: In the opening of Dallas Buyers Club, the viewer enters the rough macho world of American bull riding, a world inhabited unashamedly by people from the lower social strata of the 'lone-star state'. Next we are in a hospital: friendly, white, anti-septic, efficient. Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey) belongs to the former universe: a bull riding (although we only get to see him at that at the very end), womanizing, gambling homophobic redneck of the worst kind. Thrown into the latter environment and confronted with an HIV diagnosis, he has to try and cope with a world he doesn't know – that of the peak of the AIDS scare in 1985 – one in which he finds himself weak, facing his own death, in which he's ostracized by his former buddies and shares his fate with those he despises, such as the transsexual Rayon (Jared Leto in a rare return to what the 30 Seconds to Mars front man still does best: acting). After initial denial, Woodruff stubbornly sets out to defy the doctors' prognosis that he only has 30 days left to live. He goes to Mexico, finds alternative drugs and – back in gambling and money-making mode – starts a business selling those drugs which have not been approved by U.S. authorities yet, fighting the systems and reluctantly having to question his own beliefs.Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's film. Not only did he lose over 20 kg to play the emaciated Woodruff, he becomes his character in the best possible sense. McConaughey starts out as an entirely unsympathetic and rather despicable homophobic and misogynistic man in dirty jeans and T shirt and he follows his character's development into a conscientious campaigner, savvy businessman and caring friend without entirely turning him inside out. The redneck is still there in the end, the macho, too, the swagger having become perhaps even greater. McConaughey and director Jean-Marc Vallée avoid any Saul to Paul cliché, they show a man who does what he needs to survive a little longer, whose selfishness results in helping others and ultimately something resembling compassion, whose gigantic ego enables him to fight against the odds and become a completely unlikely hero. Who has nothing heroic about him: McConaughey does not idolize Woodruff, he does not explain him – he is there, plain and simple, in all his ugliness, meanness, and prejudice. He is no saint but a fully fleshed-out human: very flawed but with an almost obscene will to live. The subtlety with which McConaughey depicts his character, the uncompromising way with which he inhabits him, carry the film and make it a convincing plea for humaneness and compassion with the conviction that it can be found anywhere and in any place. Dallas Buyers Club reminds the viewer that it is not the 'good people' alone who affect change, that progress can start with anyone.Vallée's best move was to give the film entirely to McConaughey, aided by a cast headed by Leto whose portrayal of Rayon between self-assured pride and broken despair should earn him more than the Oscar nomination he already has (as does McConaughey). Vallée focuses on Woodruff, gives him a carefully designed environment of mid-1980s shabbiness, dynamic photography that reflects the unsteadiness of this driven man, and pale washed-out colors placing him clearly in a world and time when fear brought out the worst in otherwise seemingly civilized people. The discriminatory atmosphere of U.S. society at the time is hinted at, as is the questionable role the authorities played when it came to dealing with the AIDS epidemic. If you took McConaughey out of the film, Dallas Buyers Club would at best be a very conventional and highly average drama – with him, however, this is an outstanding and memorable film about how hard and how easy it is to be human. At the end of the film, Ron finally rides a bull. In a way, he hasn't done anything else.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",8,1,1,20 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A human journey
","And so the journey continues. With The Desolation of Smaug, Peter Jackson has now presented the middle part of his trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. A difficult task as it has to serve as a bridge between the beginning and the end of the story but also be capable of standing on its own. In his Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jackson decided to narrow the view, focus on key episodes and thus offer a contrast from the panoramic vision of parts one and three. Still, The Two Towers was arguably the weakest installment of the series. This time, Jackson again departs from the style and focus of the first part: Whereas there he adopted a much slower pace, allowed scenes to play out for as long as they could and chose a much more comical as well as fairy-tale like tone, he now gets down to business. The Desolation of Smaug is faster, narratively tighter and way more serious than An Unexpected Journey. Thus, it is much closer to The Lord of the Rings.As it is meant to be. Much more so than I the first part, Jackson adds characters and story lines not in the book that serve one purpose mostly: embed the adventure tale in a darker, larger one, an approaching battle of good and evil. So the film basically tells two stories: that of the company of dwarfs and a hobbit to reclaim the old dwarf kingdom from a dragon and the buildup to the events of the earlier trilogy. For much of the film the two strands run parallel to each other, but Jackson succeeds, as it goes on, to atmospherically intertwine them, lifting the adventure tale to a battle in a much bigger war. This does not go without some arm twisting and results in a not entirely consistent film but it works better and better as it progresses, suddenly infusing the smaller story with an importance it might not have had before.As the tale gets more serious, so do the characters, first and foremost hobbit Bilbo, played by Martin Freeman. His is a true coming-of-age story (despite his advanced age), enfolding like a Bildungsroman. It is fascinating to watch Freeman subtly add muscle and courage to his character, augment the comfort-loving Bilbo with a maturity he did not have in the first firm. For this is still a story of the most unlikely of heroes, a – literally – little man rising to the stature he needs to make himself and those in his charge survive. The darker the surroundings, the brighter his light shines and the more he can inspire those around him. Jackson's strength lies in creating three-dimensional characters in just a few sketches – and Freeman is the perfect actor to achieve this.Sure, not everything works out. Such as the addition of the elvish woman Tauriel and her love story with dwarf Kili. This adds little to an otherwise very tightly-knit narrative, threatening to derail it occasionally. On the other hand, Jackson's obvious love for the powers of the current generation of CGI is less pervasive here. The visual effects are mind-boggling again, but they serve the story. Easily Jackson moves from place to place, episode to episode without any sense of the fragmentary. There is a wholeness to this that the first part lacked, everything belongs together, woven delicately into a rich and fascinating texture. Far from being a stretch, embedding the tale into what is basically the eternal struggle of life, to live and make sense of it, makes the film stronger and the individual journey at its hard even stronger. For this is what the film is: a tale of human perseverance, far from naïve but not without optimism. This way, The Hobbit becomes a parable of human life. And a convincing one, too.http://www.stagescreen.de",8,3,6,4 January 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A Long-awaited Journey
","With all due respect: The title is somewhat misleading. This journey was far from unexpected. In fact, there are many in all corners of the globe who have been waiting for this journey to begin ever since Peter Jackson groundbreaking trilogy adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series to the big screen ended in 2003. Now it finally has arrived, after some trouble along the way. Peter Jackson is back at the helm and what was once to be a single film has now turned into yet another trilogy. An interesting choice, considering the fact that not only is The Hobbit only one book compared to the three of The Lord of the Rings, it is even shorter than the shortest of the latter's volumes. A cheap ploy to earn three times instead of once or a chance to do some intricate and detailed story-telling? If the first part is anything to go by, Jackson's choice might turn out to have been a good one.For if the earlier trilogy had any fault, it was that it did feel a bit rushed at times, that characters were not fully developed, that every now and then the story took a far too sudden and slightly arbitrary turn. It had its narrative holes that could not entirely be filled with stunning scenery, overwhelming special effects and action sequences never seen before. Having said that, The Lord of the Rings did write film history and reaffirmed what used to be a consensus, once upon a time: that the cinema was a place were stories were told that could take the viewer and listener to different worlds and fantastic places, made them see things they had not seen before. Film's power to create its own universe was once thought to be its one great power and The Lord of the Rings brought this back to our time as no film (or three for that matter) had done before.Peter Jackson is aware of this and of the expectations this entails. And so he throws a long flashback sequence at us that not only tells about the origins of the story to be told but is clearly meant to overwhelm. It takes the audience into a long lost underground kingdom of endless halls, uncounted inhabitants and unimaginable treasures. However, it becomes a little to clear what Jackson tries to do here: first, he wants to outplay the earlier films, show how much more computer animation can do now, that he can still surprise and render the viewer speechless. Secondly, an abundance of elaborate (and fully computer-generated) tracking shots are designed for one thing only: to make the most of the high-end 3D technology the film was made with. It is an uneasy start. Too much surface, too little substance.And it has another weakness: The charm of The Hobbit has a lot to do with that which makes it different from The Lord of the Rings. It is a much lighter, simpler tale, an old-fashioned adventure story, far removed, from the vast world vision of the trilogy, with its philosophical and metaphysical undercurrent, its many interweaving stories, countless characters and the ultimate war between good and evil. The Hobbit, in contrast is basically a treasure hunt that does not have much more in common with the later novels than its setting and personnel. Jackson, however, seems to distrust its ability to hold its own. So he stresses the connection with the heavier tale and inserts quite a few that weren't in the book. It is no coincidence that it starts on the same day as the trilogy did, that he takes every opportunity to insert characters from it that aren't part of the Hobbit's story, like Frodo, Saruman or Lady Galadriel. He also includes various and increasingly annoying hints and dark insinuations that not all is as simple as it seems that there is something darker and more meaningful and more dangerous working in the background. This is no simple fairytale, Jackson keeps telling us, as if that were a bad thing.Thankfully, we soon find out that it is not by any means. Because the longer the film lasts, the more its maker seems to trust Tolkien's imagination and does what he does best: translate it into a unique cinematographic language that can suck the viewer right into this strange world full of odd yet mostly lovable characters. And this is where he uses the chance he has given himself by dividing the film into three: he takes the time to tell stories, detailed, elaborate, full of fascinating colours. The sequence in which the dwarfs raid the title character's house and eat up all he has, is a masterpiece of warm- hearted, three-dimensional (in more than one way) and highly comical story-telling. Once Jackson accepts that he is telling a fairytale, the film works its magic. The characters are much more worked out than in the earlier trilogy and Martin Freeman is an ideal Bilbo Baggins: no hero whatsoever but a pompous, nervous, selfish and fearful little everyman, a hero against his will, a perfect fairytale hero.For The Hobbit is a tale about an ordinary, totally unremarkable person who is able to do great things, not out of heroism but just because he has to. The more Freeman takes over the more The Hobbit separates itself from The Lord of the Rings, shakes off its burden. And suddenly, we find ourself in a fascinating universe that is even more colourful and considerably more alive than that of the trilogy. So much so that in the end, The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey though not quite being the masterpiece Peter Jackson might have hoped for, is at least one thing for certain: a great promise.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",7,0,4,27 December 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Welcome to the dream factory
","Film is often compared to dreams, after all Hollywood us called the 'dream factory', leading us into strange lands that often only exist as long as the lights are low and the projector is running. So it is only fitting that the world's largest film festival would open with an elaborate and visually overwhelming dream. Such is Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel, telling the story of Zero, a lobby boy at a luxury hotel in a pre-war fantasy state who is mentored by the legendary concierge Monsieur Gustave and plunges into an epic adventure with him. The film is a brightly colored tour de force, hilariously funny, a crazy comic book world full of strange and enchanting creatures. A passing, temporary world in which one can, for a short time, live or at least imagine a dream life. Like a hotel. The visuals are astounding, the story-telling, fast-paced, inventive, always surprising, the characters quirky, grotesque, lovable. The Grand Budapest Hotel is a gigantic and excessively sweet candy floss kind of a movie full of a stellar cast on the edge of quirkiness, a wildly entertaining ride that fully exploits film's ability to create fantasy worlds that still manage to lay bare hints of the world we know. For despite all the colorfulness, the film also tells the story of a world threatened by war and violence, a dream long turned into nightmare. The Grand Budapest Hotel has its redundancies (such as the present day framing story) but it is a beautiful homage to the past we have lost but are encouraged to re- create and create anew with the greatest gift we have: imagination. And ultimately, it is a tribute to that wonderful dream machine we call cinema filled with hints and associations for those who want to find them (down to such a detail as the aspect ratio) – albeit one that doesn't take itself too seriously. Which might be its most charming and enchanting quality.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",8,15,39,20 February 2014
The Theory of Everything," A Dream Called Life
","Blurred shapes in golden light. Round and round it goes, a figure, it slowly emerges, in a wheelchair, effortlessly transforming to a spinning bicycle wheel in soft blue light. This begins James Marsh's film about Stephen Hawking, the best-known science of our time, struck with a degenerating disease at 21 years of age, who has lived more than 50 years after being given no more than two by doctor. An unlikely story, a miracle, one might once have said, but first and foremost a story of perseverance and love. Love to knowledge and love between two humans, rolled all in one. The film centers on the relationship between Hawking and his first wife Jane who stuck with him through it all, stubbornly refused to turn off life support when doctors gave up and who eventually had to find a new life without him.Marsh and his director of photography, Benoît Delhomme, paint the story in soft pastel-like colors interspersed with grainy interludes of wordless happiness, and infuse it with the rhythm of a flowing ballad, a never-ending song, giving the film a dream-like quality. The story's harder edges – the fear, the overwhelming demands of a disabled husband, the eventual parting of ways – are not denied but they are not delivered as dramatic highlights or turning points, but rather as matter-of-fact stages in a life story unfolding in a time which is both linear as it is stagnate or, to return to the folk's opening, circular. There are no outbreaks, just a series of acceptances that life might do many things – but it never goes according to plan. But even in the most painful moments, there is a warmth to the characters that seems almost unreal. The Theory of Everything has the enchanted nature of a dream – and just like a dream it is as real as human experience gets.The film touches on and sketches the various stages of Hawking's scientific development but it doesn't focus on his theories. Instead, it embeds them in a larger narrative of human should looking for meaning: in science, love, religion or even themselves. At the center of all this is Eddie Redmayne who delivers an earth-shattering performance as Hawking. He starts out as a somewhat clumsy geekish youth who as the disease begins to encapsulate his body is more and more reduced to tiny, but telling movements of eyes and mouth. Redmayne never shows off, his acting is subtle, accentuating the stages of decay while at no moment allowing us to forget that his character's brain and soul are exempt from the implosion of his physical powers. If it's true that the greatest actors only need the slightest wink or twitch to convey a world of emotions, Eddie Redmayne belongs to the very best. Yes, The Theory of Everything at times appears to simple, to easily flowing, as in the triangle between Stephen, Jane and her eventual second husband Jonathan. But then again, it is not a naturalistic painting but an impressionistic sketch merged with a romantic landscape. A dream called life. Nothing less.www.stategescreen.de",9,1,2,30 January 2015
Selma," A Portrait of the Hero as a Human
","No, this doesn't seem right: words of doubt are the first we hear in this film centering on the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader if the United States civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s Martin Luther King. Dies it refer to his Nobel acceptance speech, the festive tie, or his public role? Selma starts long after King talked about his dream on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on the night of King's greatest honor, the Oslo Nobel ceremony. A global hero, an admired fighter for justice and equality, a deeply hated figure amongst those who feared and opposed change. The film accompanies King through the battle for voting rights in the Alabama town of Selma right to President Johnson announcing the Voting Rights Act in 1965.Selma focuses on the events of those months and on the people at their center, first and foremost King himself. British actor David Oyelowo plays King as a determined leader, a charismatic speaker and a doubting and quite flawed human. As the hero King moves to the shadows, the man emerges.It is Selma's great strength that it eschews all the temptations of the biopic genre, that it avoids the spectacular but is content with shedding a glimpse of a pivotal moment in recent American history. It moves into back rooms, kitchens, King's home, churches turned into makeshift meeting rooms. The public stance – the standoff in front of the Selma courthouse, the three marches to Montgomery, King's speeches – provide the narrative frame and are filmed in a haunting way, especially the first march's violent suppression that director Ava DuVernay and cinematographer Bradford Young depict in slow motion, accentuating the brutality as well the suffering of the brave marchers while giving the whole scene the nightmarish quality of an event that defies understanding. It is in scenes like this that the viewer realizes why these men and women do what they do, why they really have no choice. The doubts come in the more intimate moments: King's conversations with his wife, the seemingly endless debates with other leaders, an attempt as resignation diverted in a long and calmly narrated car ride.Here, King is a man full of fear and doubt, who calls singer Mahalia Jackson in the middle of the night to hear her soothing voice, who often wonders if the price isn't too high, if he isn't hurting his family too much, if his public struggle might not do more harm than good. A man, too, who likes a laugh and who has not been entirely faithful to his wife, a man not completely immune to fame and admiration. But also a stubborn fighter who stands up to President Johnson, played memorably by another British actor, Tom Wilkinson. It is true that Johnson's portrayal is a little more negative than history warrants but the film needs him as a well-enough meaning but pragmatic antagonist far removed from the plain racism of people like Alabama governor George Wallace. Another troubled man, beset by various pressures, trying to do the right thing but more than once lost in a tangle he can hardly see through. In the end, Johnson comes around and King triumphs but it is a triumph that is only the beginning of new fights – for both men.Young's camera often moves King off center, slightly to the left or right, symbolizing a man far less certain than his public persona. A golden light drenches most scenes, not romanticizing, suggesting a different time, the treacherous marshlands of memory, while the camera brings these people close to us with their struggle that is far from over today. a struggle fought as much in dark rooms and conflicting, doubtful minds as on the street. What Selma most succeeds in is to take the events of 1965 out of the history books and return them to the people behind them. It depicts the legends as humans, struggling with all kinds of everyday human conditions, fear, doubt, indecisiveness, anger. It depots King and his allies as humans fighting a human fight that is heroic entirely in it being completely ordinary, at least for those involved. Change starts with the 'ordinary' who come to a point when they feel like they have no choice but to act. When, in the end, Selma uses original footage of the third march, Ferguson (which is alluded to in the film's Oscar-winning flagship song 'Glory') seems closer than ever. Selma could not be any more contemporary than it is.www.stagescreen.de",8,0,0,4 March 2015
The Artist," When Silence Talks
","It is not uncommon in times of crises, to look for solutions in the past which, as a rule, had always been better than the dreary past. And so it is not much of a surprise that, in an America tortured by economic crisis and its decreasing importance in the world, the most celebrated film of the year, the one Hollywood throws every accolade on it has to offer, is a black and white silent movie looking back at Hollywood's golden age. Alas, it was made by a Frenchman and its star is French as well. Even Hollywood, it seems, can be made better abroad. In a year that has seen remarkable films dealing with a society's identity crisis, the many awards may appear as a sign of escapism. Or maybe The Artist is just this good?The film tells the story of Hollywood's biggest silent movie star, George Valentine whose career is cut short when he refuses to join the new talking movie era. He goes through a major identity crisis, almost commits suicide but survives through the help of those who love him and even gains new success by finding a language of his own which allows him to cut out a place in the new film era – or to put it shortly: by reinventing himself. Maybe there is a message for our uncertain times.Be this as it may, The Artist works on so many other levels. In the beginning it is hard to remember that this is not a film from the 1920s, so spot on does it capture the esthetic of storytelling, imagery and editing – and, of course, the expressive acting style required by silent movies and brilliantly mastered by the films cast, especially Jean Dujardin, a movie star somewhere between Rudolph Valentino and Groucho Marx, and Bérénice Bejo, whose starlet Peppy Miller is a fascinating mixture of dumb blonde (although she isn't even blond) of adoring lover. Both seem to come straight from the silent movie era, Dujardin's George Valentin certainly would have made it there. And so would George's dog who is there in the comedy and the tragedy, an animal clown and a loving friend – and the secret star of this film. Nothing here is ever only one thing.The Artist is, of course, first and foremost an homage to the silent move to a time where actors did not need dialogue because they had faces as a character in Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard once put it. The film is full of reminiscences, styles and scenes taken straight out of the era's greatest films. The fascination, the wonder that early audiences must have felt, it is captured here, as the viewer also must learn to deal with the absence of the familiar. When, at the start, we witness a film premiere which culminates in thundering and yet completely silent applause, the modern viewer may, for the first time, learn that silence can be heard and that it can be painfully loud as in that scene towards the end when George and Peppy, who represent the old and the new, finally come together, without a sound, not even music.Director Michel Hazanavicius manages a perfect balance between the comic and the serious, moves effortlessly from slapstick to tragedy and back into romantic comedy. It is a mix of genres in which everything from the world of silent movies finds its place and still it is more than a series of quotations. There are memorable scenes such as when Peppy helps George's empty coat to engage in a sensual embrace or when, in a nightmare, everything begins to make a sound yet George remains silent. The whole film keeps coming back to the language-silence topic: From the opening scene, in which – as part of a film – Russian spies try to torture George's character into speaking but he remains silent. Repeatedly, speaking appears as frightening, threatening, unbalancing.And yet, at the very end, George says a word, in a thick French accent, which may explain his refusal to speak on film. So maybe it wasn't his pride, his insistence on being an artist rather than a puppet, after all? Who know? All we do know is that this is a fascinating eye- and ear-opener which works as an homage to an art form long lost, as a parable on the necessity of change, a declaration of love to love and friendship and, I'm sure, on many other levels. Maybe, at least once in a while, seeing things in black and white is not such a bad thing after all.",9,3,5,29 January 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," One Woman's Mission
","The distinction between good and bad is blurred from the outset in Zero Dark Thirty. Maya, a young CIA operative, fresh from headquarters, arrives in Iraq and the first thing she sees is the interrogation of a suspected terrorist against whom waterboarding and other torture techniques are used.Initially clearly uncomfortable with the situation, Maya will soon adapt to the methods and culture employed here to deal with suspects. This, she concludes, is no place and time for scruples. Like her, the film does not condemn any of the tactics and methods used in George W. Bush's so-called War on Terror, it simply shows them and their consequences. For it must be part of an honest debate to also acknowledge that, at least when it comes to the search for Bin Laden, these highly problematic activities did yield some results. In this world, in this permanent state of emergency, the viewer learns, good and bad are really hard to keep apart, there is no black or white and sometimes, the grey turns awfully dark. Zero Dark Thirty leads to many questions as to how far a free and democratic society is allowed to go for the greater good as they say but it provides no easy answers. These are questions we all must answer for ourselves. Too unsettling a thought for the Academy?First and foremost, however, Zero Dark Thirty is the story of one woman's mission, of her crusade to show the world and everybody else that she is right. And this Maya, no less than those she hunts, is a fanatic, an extremist, uncompromising, relentless, deaf to all reasoning. A woman who writes the number of days wasted every morning on her boss' glass door, who gives herself up to her task, who signs a pact with her very personal devil to complete a mission whose sole meaning seems to lie in its fulfilment. Bigelow does well to refrain from building artificial tension, from working the register of suspense. Watching Jessica Chastain freeze, tighten, unravel, observing her body getting ever more tense when all of her nears the breaking point, is quite enough. There is a documentary feel to how the camera follows Chastain's Maya and it completely takes over when we leave her at last and join the team that invades Bin Laden's final hiding place and ends up killing him. There is nothing heroic about this, just people doing their jobs, not asking whether what they're doing is right, in the conventional sense.There is no triumph, relief yes, but also a sense of loss when Maya, having completed her mission, finally breaks down. Her mission is over but what has been gained? For her? For us? Zero Dark Thirty is a film that asks questions but provides no answers, questions which we might not want to answer because we might not like what we could find. There are no easy exists here, no comfortable paths, just a look into the heart of darkness – ours, society's, the human soul's. At times we might be tempted to avert our eyes, but maybe it is a good thing that we don't. No, not maybe, it most certainly is.",9,8,15,21 March 2013
12 Years a Slave," One man's life
","12 Years a Slave, the new film by British director Steve McQueen is the latest in a series of filmic treatment of slavery, one of the darkest chapters in US history. After Quentin Tarantino's revenge tale Django Unchained and Lincoln, Steven Spielberg's political drama about slavery's official abolition, it leads us into the heart of human degradation and cruelty, and to the core of an American trauma that has not been properly dealt with in the past, that still lingers in all the unsolved issues plaguing US society today. Perhaps now the time is right. For the first time in history, a black man is holding the highest office in the land, living proof how far the country has come. A look at America today, however, shoes the long distance still ahead and maybe a film like 12 Years a Slave can serve as a reminder that the wounds that the system of treating humans as things, extending the principle of property to living souls, has created have not healed.The film opens with a series of seemingly disconnected images: a group of slaves standing motionless in a field; a man and a woman turning towards each other in the night, a man in shackles. Not a word is spoken, past and present indistinguishable, a human life reduced to brief glimpses. 12 Years a Slave tells the true story of Solomon Northup, a father of two and skilled violinist, a respected member of the community of Saratoga Springs in upstate New York. He gets lured to Washington, DC, under a pretense, is kidnapped and sold as a slave to Louisiana. He first works for a relatively humane slaver before he, following a confrontation with his chief carpenter, is sold to a brutal and sadistic new 'master'. Only after twelve years he can, with much luck and help from his home community, regain his freedom. A rare exception that allows him to tell a story he shares with many but which most never lived to tell.In other directors' hands, 12 Years a Slave might have turned into a sentimental, pathos drenched melodrama, drowning in a heavy musical score, driven by high drama and overblown emotions. Steve McQueen, a rising star among Hollywood directors, however, tells the story in an equally poetic as well as serious, unsentimental, unsparing way, accompanied by a surprisingly unassuming score by Hans Zimmer, that remains close to the protagonist throughout, that sets out to tell his unique story and to reach the universal strictly through the individual. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Solomon a man robbed of his life, his identity, his name, even his right to call himself human. His acting is subtle, as he moves from defiance through pragmatic survival to all the deformations this de-humanization enforces on body and soul. He is no hero but a man who wants to live, one who tries to stay low, who even allows to become an instrument of suppression only not to be its target.McQueen rolls past and present into one, juxtaposes strikingly beautiful images of the Southern countryside with extreme and very graphic cruelty, continues a cynical racist song into the next scene when the seemingly kind master preaches from the bible, contrasts the everyday with the inhumane as in a long scene in which Solomon, following an interrupted hanging remains for hours dangling from the rope, his feet just touching the ground and groping to keep the body up, while in the background children play. In this world, normal life and the loss of all basic principles of humaneness are one, as are beauty and the turning of humans into objects, an upside down world in which time has stopped, an eternity of suffering in which past and present are the same because there is no future. But as much as these people are forced to play their roles, they cannot help but remain humans with their very own hopes and fears and characters and personalities. An involuntary defiance that is almost harder to bear for the oppressors as outright rebellion would be. Michael Fassbender is Ejiofor's counterpart, a sadistic slaveholder with no hint of true human feelings, yet a soul even more deformed by this unnatural economy that those of his victims. The agent of terror is no free man either, tortured by demons stronger than any whip. But there is no excuse, as haunted as he is, he remains culpable without limitation.McQueen describes without excusing. No-one gets out of this unharmed, the coming home scene in which Solomon apologizes to his wife for his appearance is starkly shocking. The film's great strength is the combination of complex and poetic storytelling and relentless honesty, making it a poem of human suffering as well as a stark and relentless portrait of what man can do to man. And he does so by telling one man's story, the tale of an individual body and soul, a flawed human being who stands for himself – and through that for millions of others.Admittedly, the film has its faults. Brad Pitt as the only good white man is unbearably bland, occasionally the film cannot avoid the trap of drifting into tear jerking territory, and even a little patronizing is not absent – after all, Solomon's freeing is the work of white men – but these are very minor flaws in what is otherwise a deeply disturbing, uncompromisingly honest depiction of humanity at its cruelest. When the academy Awards are handed out in late February, 13 Years a Slave is widely expected to be named 'Best Picture'. There hasn't been a more deserving winner in years.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",9,1,5,26 January 2014
Whiplash," Blood, sweat and music
","No, this will not be fun and games. This much is clear as the camera moves slowly through a dark corridor towards a similarly dark and bare room with a sole drum kid behind which a young man is sweating. Relentlessly – against his instrument and himself – he is repeating the same patterns and rhythms, again and again. The distant view of him becomes intimate and then dissolves – into partial glimpses of his face, hands, drumsticks. There will be much sweat, tears, blood, the drumsticks will become instruments of torture inflicted by the young man to himself. If love for music was the initial motivation to take up this strenuous activity, he has moved far beyond it at the film's outset. Miles Teller plays Andrew, an ambitious young musical student moving into the dark realm of obsession, willing to throw away family, friendship, love in pursuit of that elusive dream and nightmare of being someone special, being remembered, not fading into oblivion when his tombstone is erected. His face will harden and shut and distort itself as he will learn to play the game.A game whose master is Terence Fletcher (JK Simmons) a legendary musician turned sadistic teacher who will do anything to achieve perfection, leaving plenty of corpses along the wayside. Soon Fletcher discovers Andrew and recruits him to his elite band in which survival of the fittest is the norm. Andrew, starting out in friendly naivety quickly learns the game, accepts the power struggle, lashes out against his competitors and ultimately overestimates his power. What starts out as a coming of age film about a boy pursuing his dream turns into a thriller in which strong wills battle and only one can survive. If Andrew wants to be the one he has to turn into the other, become Fletcher, lose all scruples, become unashamedly brutal and cruel. Against himself and against others. As in all good thrillers there are various twists and turns and, when all seems to be over, an epic showdown that leaves the viewer shaking. By that time, the lines between good and bad have long been blurred, the distinction become irrelevant, the price to be payed for the dream's pursuit unpayable and at the same time unquestioningly accepted.Whiplash is an unforgiving powerhouse of a film, an uncompromising tale about what trying to be the best entails, how much it can strip you of your humaneness, and about the choices one must make in life. Andrew makes his, has them taken away and restored and, given a second chance, returns to the path that already almost destroyed him once – or maybe it already did. But it's his choice, he is victim and culprit all in one. Teller plays his role with brutal honestly and he has a frighteningly impressive counterpart in a Mephistophelic Simmons whose Faust ultimately threatens to supplant him. The film never goes for simple morality, it asks questions that we seem to be able to answer easily. But then we see this utterly likable boy find his own answers which are very different from ours and we start wondering whether all this might not be a little more complicated than we though.Director Damien Chazelle tells this story in the frantic rhythm of the jazz that is instrument and fate and abyss of those that fight in this arena, armed with drumsticks that are as deadly a weapon as swords. The images move with the pulse of this throbbing, unrelenting music, fragmenting into long shots and extreme close-ups, a dance of mosaic pieces that becomes its own song. Camera, editing, sound merge into a never-ending beat that accelerates and slows down, frantically races to its climax before it comes to a standstill only to restart itself into a powerful back and forth as the opponents who are also accomplices engage in one last battle. Light and color are part of the package, too: the slightly nostalgic glow of romantic dreams becomes the pale grey of disillusion before turning into the golden light of competition. Who has won and what would be the criteria for winning, what its price. Whiplash sings its own song of life, a life that isn't black or white, a life in which winning might be fatal and the greatest triumph the worst defeat. It has a million equation but no answers. All it offers is blood, sweat, tears. And music.",9,1,5,27 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," The heart of brightness
","Trust and integrity: These are the values a TV commercial proclaims with which The Wolf of Wall Street opens, presenting a brokerage firm as a hard-working, serious, honest service provider for those who want to invest their money in an efficient and successful way. Once the commercial ends, we get a glimpse into the company as it is: the scene opens to a raucous office hosting an orgiastic party complete with dwarf tossing, sex, alcohol and more than enough drugs to last a lifetime. Based on the true story of fraudulent stock broker Jordan Belfort, the film dives deeply into the heart of what is wrong with an economy that has embraced greed as a key component of the way it works. Where J.C. Chandon's Margin Call was a cool analysis of the workings of a system that is based on no substance whatsoever and Oliver Stone's second incarnation of Wall Street is a thriller depicting the workings of personal greed, Martin Scorsese presents the economy of greed as an orgiastic and never-ending feast that devours everything else, in which money is the drug of drugs and is equivalent with success, sex, life. A parallel world following its own rules and totally disconnected with the outside world it so drastically affects.As in his classic gangster tales, Scorsese chooses the inside perspective. And so we watch Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio in an earth- shattering performance) as he rises from small Wall street apprentice, mentored by a slick and yet charming veteran broker (perfect cliché and compelling personality: Matthew McConaughey), to the master of stock fraud, committed entirely to his firm's – and his own – prosperity, which he achieves mostly by duping investors into deals that can only have one winner: Belfort and his posse. The film's most disturbing aspect is how it commits itself to following the special logic on which this world is turning. Drawn into the vortex of success and admiring the brilliant strategy Belfort follows, the viewer only gradually understands that there is world outside, full of defrauded clients who lose their mortgages, their children's college money, their homes, their livelihoods, They never appear, yet the longer the film continues, the more their presents is felt, the more they weigh on the glamorous world of eternal success.A world that Scorsese paints in the brightest colors: The Wolf of Wall Street is an orgiastic film portraying an orgiastic universe in which money is everything. Whether it is wild partying, boundless sex, limitless drug use or the everyday work at the office: this is a life on speed, fast-paced, constantly seeking out extreme, a permanent high which cannot afford a coming down. All is one, whether the brokers frantically call their 'clients', whether they have a totally out of control orgy on a plane, discuss 'dwarf tossing' in the most cynical way imaginable or turn the serious business of how to get their money abroad into a sex-filled extravaganza: sex, money, 'love', drugs are all part of the same permanent rush that allows for no other reality than the one they have created themselves. Apart from DiCaprio who delivers the performance of his life, Jonah Hill impresses as Belfort's even more out of control sidekick, a virtuoso of everything extreme. There are no morals in this world and there cannot be any, only one easy answer: money is everything.Scorsese spares no details, the film is graphic and at the same time way over the top. The story-telling as well as the visuals occasionally have a comic book touch. Realism isn't Scorsese's goal, what he tries to achieve is to convey how it must feel to live inside this bubble. This includes the danger of making it feel desirable: a trap Scorsese skillfully plays with and avoids. The more the spiral spins, the more grotesque this world becomes, the more that initial fascination is replaced with unease and ultimately disgust. The turning point is a long scene in which DiCaprio and Hill, looking for the ultimate high, descend into a hell of crawling, mumbling and completely spinning out of any remnants of self-control, a long scene lasting several minutes that will enter film history as the most uncompromising as well as imaginative and equally comical as well as devastating depiction of a drug-induced state of mind ever.From here, it's downhill but Scorsese is smart enough not to gives us a happy or even moral ending. Despite going to jail for a few years, his Belfort is on top of the world again as a highly successful author and motivational speakers, once again pulling his old tricks. The film ends with Belfort's apparent nemesis, FBI agent Denham (Kyle Chandler) riding a New York City subway train, a dreary and totally unglamorous scene with no sense of triumph or satisfaction. The order has been restored, the gamblers rule and justice is little more than a drop in the ocean, with no effect or long-term consequence. The Wolf of Wall Street is a crazily funny comedy that ends on a quiet and bitter note, a wildly colorful yet deeply honest film that beneath the craze and behind the parallel universe it depicts conceals a stark reality that presents itself even more strongly in its absence. Yet again, Martin Scorsese has come to the core of what makes the world work and delivers yet another masterpiece.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",10,3,10,30 January 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Miracle on 44th Street
","The drum is beating relentlessly as the camera moves down narrow and shabby corridors, pauses in an actor's backstage dressing room, both of them seeming to have their best days long behind them, the movement, the claustrophobic space and the drumming intensifying to a foreboding, threatening atmosphere that turns this dirty underbelly of Broadway glamour into the darkness of a tortured man's soul. Michael Keaton who was Batman plays Riggan Thomson who was Birdman. A former movie star way past his prime trying to resurrect his career by turning to the stage, establishing himself as a serious actor and battling more himself, his diminished self-worth, his shortcomings as a husband and father than any outside pressure. His demons are with him – literally, in a move that quotes Keaton's Batman days. Keaton, a seemingly washed-up has-been plays a seemingly washed-up has-been – and he does so with a force, an honesty, a self-effacing radical relentlessness that would guarantee his an Academy Award almost any year (though perhaps not this one due to Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking). A man struggling between outside appearance and a growing inability to escape the inner voice, Keaton's performance is one for the ages.Alejandro González Iñárritu has the camera follow his protagonist with intricate and never- ending tracking shots as we accompany him through the labyrinth that is a theatre's hidden undergrowth and the maze of a trouble soul. The rhythm of the camera, the nervous pounding of the drum, the tortured dishevelment of Keaton's face all convey the sense of a human soul and mind becoming unhinged and struggling to recover any sanity he can muster. The existential fight of an individual navigating the shaky line between the personal and the public. González Iñárritu effortlessly moves from the naturalistic to the delusional and the dream-like fantastic as reality ans imagination become harder and harder to tell apart. He bridges that fragile frontier as well as time gaps in single, apparent unedited shots, time and space become fluid and as unstable as the protagonist's mind. Keaton is surrounded by a staler cast led by Edward Norton playing a sociopathic actor whose search for truth has turned him into an extremist in life and work. He is Keaton's nemesis, foil, catalyst to unleash his power. Then there are Emma Stone as Riggan's troubled and ever angry daughter, Zach Galifianakis as loyal friend and choleric manager, Naomi Watt's as a self-conscious actress impatient to make it and Andrea Riseborough as Riggan's lover torn between cynicism and a longing for closeness.As good as the cast is, the miracle this film is lies in its ingenious story-telling. How Alejandro González Iñárritu weaves camera, editing sound and Keaton's acting together, the way he combines drama, fantasy, comedy and satire (his portrait of the New York theatre industry is quite poignant), how he infuses it with New York's manic heartbeat and has it all mirror in Michael Keaton's face has not been seen in film before. In an Oscar year in which Richard Linklater redefined film making by stretching time beyond the hitherto feasible, González Iñárritu reimagines the possibilities of filmic story-telling. Birdman is one of those films where the critic's pen must fail. It needs to be more than seen, it has to be experienced as the complex and ridiculous symphony of light and dark, of the universal and the trivial, of the human condition and poignantly funny comedy that it is.www.stagescreen.de",10,3,11,3 February 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Missing in Action
","There are moments when art and reality clash in such a brutal and inescapable way that art seems to lose its (presumed) innocence, perhaps even its freedom and is forever tarnished by something that it cannot control and is not responsible for. When a 24-year-old man walked in to a Colorado movie theater and murdered twelve people who were watching the final chapter in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, such a horrible, catastrophic moment occurred. Far from bearing any responsibility for the killings, The Dark Knight Rises will forever be connected to what happened in that Aurora theater. Even more so as the random meaninglessness of the atrocity might appear to mirror the recurring central plot element of the films: the intended annihilation of an entire city's population for the community's alleged sins, an attempted mass murder as random and meaningless as the very real horror that occurred on the film's opening night. The film and its makers will have to live with this and with the fact that inside many viewers another film takes place while they are watching this one.The Dark Knight Rises closes Nolan's revival of the Batman franchise which returned to it its standalone position in the superhero universe. Unlike many of his 'colleagues' Batman has never been the untarnished brightly shining hero of the Superman variety but a dark, complex, multi-faceted character always hovering on the edges of good and evil. The Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher tetralogy from the 1990s had turned the darkness into colorful popcorn cinema, Nolan restored the color black as its key characteristic. The first two instalments, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were stark and unrelenting ruminations on the dark side of the human soul, on the destructive power of fear and the fragility of hope, on human weakness and the evil that lurks within it. At times almost suffocating in its relentless examinations of humankind's pain points, they were inhabited by characters that were never just one thing, neither just good nor just evil, never clearly identifiable, there was always something to them that would not fit. First and foremost Batman himself who Christian Bale so much reduced to the symbol which he is that he almost disappeared at times and left the show to others, most memorably Heath Ledger as the Joker, a charismatic as well as deeply haunted villain who was so much more human than the masked hero. The philosophy, the dialectic of this Batman universe – it lies right here.The Dark Knight Rises proves to be the weakest instalment of the series, mainly because it never approaches this two-faced complexity of the earlier parts. This is even more disappointing as its story would prepare it to be the darkest Batman film yet. The Gotham City of this film (which no longer even tries to conceal the fact that it's really New York City) is a crippled world, a city screaming in pain. Batman is a battered middle-aged man who can hardly walk and later has his back broken, police commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) is incapacitated after being shot and Bane, the chief villain (Tom Hardy) is full of scars and wears a mask without which he cannot breathe without excruciating pain. This is a world in pain, badly wounded and maybe with no hope of being healed. The financial crisis is hinted at when Bane robs the stock exchange, later he will spark a fake revolution which some have seen as a comment on and even condemnation of the Occupy movement and even society's greatest benefactors are not what they appear to be. Everything is lost and even Batman is beyond hope.Unfortunately, the film never really takes off. Bane might be an imposing chief terrorist, however, he remains too one-dimensional without the edges, the ambiguousness of his predecessors, the explanations for his evil to simple and bloodless, he never comes to life nor do any of the other characters. The inseparable connection of good and evil which characterized the earlier films, it is only hinted at in Gordon's opportunism or the use of Batman's gadgets by the villains. the character, however, have a comic-like flatness and lack any charisma or fascination which makes them seem awkward in this three- dimensional and easily recognizable world in a very real crisis. Is this a defense of law and order against presumed anarchy, a call to arms for unselfishness and solidarity or even a statement of futility? Many threads are laid down, too many, and more are picked up from the earlier parts. However, this results in an almost chaotic mix of many topics and story lines none of which get enough attention to bloom. So the story meanders along, goes back and forth or moves around in circles and soon loses track of where it wants to head. Just as the characters, it remains little more than a sketch.And so what could have been the darkest ever Batman falls apart failing to even create some distinctive atmosphere. It opens like a James Bond thriller, its dark apocalyptic existentialism so often gives way to standard fare Hollywood action that one almost expects Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis to turn up any moment. In the end it remains unclear whether The Dark Knight Rises wants too much or does not even know what it wants. What remains are excellent action scenes and hints at the visual and atmospheric power of the earlier films that make its failure even more painful and disappointing. But perhaps there could not be any other but an imperfect ending to this dark tale of humanity's failings.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com",5,1,5,28 July 2012
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Between hope and fear
","The Hunger Games, the first installment of a series of film adaptations of Suzanne Collins' novel trilogy, was one of the surprises of the film year 2012. The Gary Ross directed film combined blockbuster appeal with sharp and uncompromising social analysis painting a clear picture of the mechanisms of totalitarianism, combined with sharp media criticism. In the story of the young girl participating in a cynical game in which children and teenagers slaughter each other until only one survives, the film envisioned a dystopia that combined insights into totalitarian systems with popular forms of media entertainment such as reality TV and casting shows that served to show how closely the perverted lust of seeing people exposed and the collective cruelty of a suppressive state are aligned. The majority, that concept on which democratic society is built, here appeared in all the dark side it also possesses. It is the individual, the thinking, feeling and conscientious human who is the only source of hope, the individual who in turn can be the root of a new, hopefully better majority.The series' second installment, entitled Catching Fire picks up where part one ended. In an act of defiance, the film's hero, Katniss tricked the system into allowing herself as well as her friend Peeta to win the games together, Torn between feelings of guilt about having killed, the pressure of society and the demands of a rising rebellious spirit, Katniss must continue to find her way while she still has not finished growing up. Catching Fire, directed by Francis Lawrence, remains close to the visual style and story-telling technique of its predecessor. The focus remains on Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Close-ups of her, moving from face to hands to fragments of her body, representing a more and more fragmented soul, still provide the key visual technique of the film. Lawrence is an actress who can condense complex inner struggles, difficult decision making processes and battles between hope and fear, defiance and desperation into a single look, into minimal changes of expression, into tiny movements, the clenching of a fist, a sudden rigidity in her body. The film makes ample use of this as it focuses on the inner fight of the protagonist.For Catching Fire moves its perspective much more inside the individual than the first part did. The mechanisms that allow a totalitarian system to work and also the deformations it causes are concentrated in the individual self. This is true for the first part in which Katniss tries to come to terms with who she is expected to be and the choices she has to conform to the demands of one side or the other. But it remains true later on when again she is sent into the arena to fight for her life, a fight that ends in a much different twist as the revolution finally begins. Here Catching Fire is as adept at fulfilling all demands on action-packed entertainment while never losing its focus. As close as the camera remains on her and her comrades, as close remains the perspective on the specific human cost of totalitarianism.The biting media satire is as sharp as in the first film, the contrasts between a decadent ruling class and the suppressed majority are depicted even more sharply and relentlessly. While the amount of killing scenes is reduced, there is no softening of the uncompromising starkness with which human suffering is being presented. The film's only weakness might be that the price of focusing on the protagonists is that the characterization of the characters further to the fringe is somewhat sketchier. This however is compensated by an even more stellar cast including memorable performances by Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer and the scarily indecipherable Philip Seymour Hoffman as the new head game maker. Jennifer Lawrence once again proves to be a rare talent, Woody Harrelson as her mentor impresses once more and Josh Hutcherson really come into his own as the dignified, honest and relentlessly fighting Peeta, Katniss' reasonable counterpart.More than its predecessor, Catching Fire is conceived as part of a series. It reduces the explanation of what happened before to a minimum and ends with a true cliffhanger. This, however, does not take anything away from the film's quality. Catching Fire marries blockbuster spectacle with intelligent soul searching, biting satire with psychological drama, entertainment with a serious message. As the first installment, it proves that giving an audience what they want and getting them to think and reflect are not mutually exclusive. The third book will be split into two films, again directed by Lawrence. It is to be hoped that they will share all that made the first two films such compelling and outstanding film making.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",8,1,18,5 December 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Don Quixote with a guitar
","No doubt: Llewyn Davis is a loser. First, his career as a folk singer  is going badly: his duet partner committed suicide, his record isn't  selling, he makes so little that he cannot afford his own apartment but  has to move from friend to friend, or rather from acquaintance to  acquaintance. Secondly, as far as human relationships are concerned, he  is a total failure. His ex girlfriend despises him, one of her  predecessors faked an abortion to have him out of her  and the mutual  child's life  people who are sympathetic to him, get a rather rude  treatment on a daily basis. After A Serious Man, the Coen brothers have  again chosen to depict a man on the wrong side of luck. Only this time,  one might say he deserves it.  Or maybe not, for he has one redeeming feature. The film opens with a  long scene in which Davis (Oscar Isaac) performs a sad old folk song.  The camera gently hovers around him, catches the hushed, intensely  attentive atmosphere of the smoky basement club, while he sucks his  audience  us  into the dark, sorrowful world he creates in his song,  hinting at a depth he so often will not show in 'real life'. It is this  contrast, the dialogue between the sadly funny tale of a modern Don  Quixote and that other, older, tenderer story, the music tells. For as  much as this is Llewyn's story, it also is that of the redeeming power  of music. For even if Davis is the same at the end as the story comes  full circle and returns to its opening, as he once again gets beaten up  and is succeeded on stage by a young, cocky folk singer with a nasal  voice who will soon change music  and not just folk music  forever,  there is just the tiniest hint that this Llewyn Davis might have some  sort of promise after all, maybe not as a successful singer, but as a  human being.  Inside Llewyn Davis is inspired loosely by the story of Dave van Ronk,  a star of the Greenwich Village folk scene around the time of Bob  Dylan's arrival there in 1961. Dylan learned a lot from van Ronk and  stole some of his most promising songs, but that is a story to be told  another day. This one is about a man lost in a world that hasn't been  waiting for him, who has a mission that is entirely his own. The  lengths to which he goes to show the world he doesn't care are  astounding. And yet he craves love. Oscar Isaac is a miracle: even in  his most repelling state, in his most rejecting attitude, there is a  flicker of sad longing in his face, his eyes, a face the Coens show us  much of. It is one you need to dive into, closed to the casual observer  but hiding so much pain and uncertainty and desire to live one  sometimes thinks it must explode. The Coens' cinema is one of subtlety,  of nuanced, of shades of grey between the black and white. In Isaac,  they have found their perfect actor, heading a stellar cast including  Carey Mulligan, John Goodman and Justin Timberlake.  As so often, the Coen brothers are masters at creating an atmosphere, a  universe of its own, unique as well as absolutely consistent. It is a  world of the night, in which grey shades reign, days are pale and dust  is everywhere. Even in the open there is a sense of narrowness, of  tight spaces, lightless basements that are cage and protective space in  one. It is the tiny holes that provide the only rooms for creativity,  for the soul to speak. And so it is that the dark world of the  underground gradually regains some warmth and coziness, the dark  becomes a zone of comfort, while everything else becomes cold and  distant.  Having said all this, Inside Llewyn Davis is first and foremost a  comedy in the Coenesque sense of the term. It is a Quixotic tale full  of quirky characters at time bordering on the fairy-tale like   especially true for the sequence around Goodman's character, a  trodden-down mixture of villain and clown that calls up associations of  the expressionist nightmare world of their earlier film Barton Fink.  The other foot of the film is firmly on the ground, in the existential  struggle of a man the world won't welcome. But there is still that  third element: music, that timeless realm of love and pain and  suffering and hope. It is here the film is anchored, it is here this  Don Quixote conquers his windmills, armed solely with his guitar. It is  here it all comes together. Tragedy, comedy, fairy tale, social drama,  held together by the softest of touches. Another Coen brothers  masterpiece. What else could be expected?",10,129,172,17 December 2013
Her," Life and life only
","A kind, faintly smiling, somewhat dreamy face in close-up tenderly speaking words of love, desire, longing. Thus opens Her, Spike Jonze's latest film, that won him his first Academy Award, for 'Best Original Screenplay'. Theodore Twombly earns his money writing 'personal handwritten letters' for others, letters directed at loved ones. They are poetic writings full of warm emotion – and they are fake. For he, freshly separated from his one and only love, has no-one to write them to. Shutting himself off in his stylish but empty apartment he tries out a new personalized computer operating system based on artificial intelligence – and falls in love with 'Samantha'. Her follows the budding and developing relationship between the desperate loner and the bodiless voice. As they help each other finding or rediscovering their identities, as they ease each other into understanding and accepting who they are, they build a closeness, an intimacy which might not last but which definitely is as real as it gets.The most surprising thing about Her is how my traps it avoids that it could easily have fallen into. It could have become a science-fiction film carried away by its exciting premise, a farcical comedy indulging in the ridiculousness of its preposterous plot, a sentimental melodrama about loneliness and the impossibility of love, a theatrical showpiece for the acting skills of Joaquin Phoenix or a biting critique of the loneliness inherent in a world in which everyone is connected and separated alike by modern technology. Her incorporates all these aspects, it comments on the despair of a man who has all the world open to him but cannot become a part of it, it is wonderfully funny and ironical, does not shy away from big emotions and paints a compelling picture of a future that might be just around the corner. But the film is more than that: just like Hoyte van Hoytema's camera that combines close-ups with a soft, sweeping motion including slow tracking shots and carefully used hand-held camera-work, the film remains locked tightly to its protagonist.Phoenix plays Twombly with delicate understatement, almost bordering on shyness, an insecure, complex-ridden man refusing closeness whose only connection with life are his memories, which Jonze inserts as short and somewhat random series of fragmentary images, and other people's love stories acted out in the letters he writes. The way he slowly and tenderly starts opening up, as his pale features are beginning to breathe life, is as remarkable as it is entirely natural and unspectacular. Such is the unassuming way Jonze characterizes Samantha: Just like Twombly she finds herself through second-hand emotions, as she goes through emails and websites and images she patches together a personality from what technology provides her with. Finding one's way through the daily media overkill and forming a sense of self through it is a key element of her and one that Jonze just throws out there without any preaching or teaching tone.Instead, he allows Her an entirely organic growth, takes his time to tell the story which he lets unfold in a poetic flow of images drenched in pale but subtly warming colors, accentuated by the equally unassuming and highly emotive original score by the outstanding Canadian band Arcade Fire. Her is not a satire, a critical pamphlet, a colorful comedy or a tear-jerking drama but a tender and despite its closeness and intimacy never intrusive portrait of a man seeking himself and the other, a touching meditation about the possibility of love. It poses questions it does not answer, but the chance remains open that answers might be found. Ultimately, the film comes full circle as it echoes and soaks up the poetry encapsulated in its opening letters, freeing it from paper, bringing it to life. In a career already marked by exceptional films (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), Her is Spike Jonze's most outstanding effort to date.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/",10,1,4,28 April 2014
