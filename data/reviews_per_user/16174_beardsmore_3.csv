First Man," Beautifully shot with some stellar performances, the only thing that lets 'First Man' down is a few pacing issues
","Silence is the first thing that sticks out at me when thinking about 'First Man'. The emotion silence conveys whether during the space scenes or the interactions on Earth, is felt every second. The performances from Gosling and Foy add to this, the sense of dread and the risks associated with the launching of Apollo 11 and it's predecessors is made clear. Although we know they are eventually successful, we still hold our breath in suspense throughout. Gosling's portrayal of Neil Armstrong as a man desperate to succeed despite his personal tragedies resonates, it gives a much deeper look into an aspect of his life that the general audience would have no idea about. It is however, the passage of time that lets this film down slightly. As the 8 or so year period is covered, there are times when certain scenes are much longer than they need to be, as a result the film seems to drag in places. Then at the other end of the spectrum, there are some events and relationships which are brushed over, I would have liked to have seen the family dynamic explored further, as well as the character of Buzz Aldrin. Overall though, 'First Man' boasts exceptional cinematography and packs an emotional punch, succeeding in shining a new light on the life of a hero.",7,0,1,22 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Captivating from start to finish, Bradley Cooper's directorial debut is a modern-day masterpiece
","The film opens with Bradley Cooper's character, veteran Jackson Maine, walking onto stage, the camera close up behind as if we are following him. He is clearly distressed, his dark personal life looming over his career as a performer. It is here we are introduced to the first of many amazing songs in this film, Bradley Cooper easily holds his own in songs with Lady Gaga, and you would have no idea this is her first major acting role, her performance as she rises through the ranks of stardom is fantastic. The chemistry between the two feels raw and real, the acting, music and cinematography is superb. The final result of this tried and true formula is one of the most emotional, engaging and thought-provoking films of the past few years, this along with a perfect original soundtrack means you won't be forgetting about this one any time soon.",10,27,57,14 October 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A swing and a stick for Sony, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is everything a Spider-Man fan could wish for.
","Sony's handling of certain Marvel properties over the last few years has certainly been questionable, but 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is everything it needed to be and so much more. A thrilling blend of action, humour and emotion, wrapped in an awe-inspiring animation style, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is one of the standout movies of 2018, and arguably the best iteration of the web-slinger. Marvel's animated projects are usually overlooked due to the figurehead that is the MCU, but this is a leap in the right direction. The premise of multiple characters with a great power and great responsibility, all of whom feel isolated in their respective universes, adds an interesting layer. After realising they are not alone, they seek solace in one another, working together in an attempt to find a way back to their respective worlds, each leaving understanding the importance they hold in the universe. Miles in particular finds himself along the way, overcoming family issues and the hardships of teenage life, all whilst coming to terms with his recently acquired superpowers. I'm sure we'd all like to be a spider-person, but we learn that we don't need to be the biggest or the strongest to be a superhero - because in our own way, we already are. But hey, you never know when you might get bit by a radioactive spider, right?",10,3,8,19 January 2019
