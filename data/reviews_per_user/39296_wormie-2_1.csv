Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why, George, why?
","Ok, this is a good movie worth seeing, but it surely is not original. Obviously, Lucas wanted to play it safe and satisfy the fans by giving them modified versions of scenes they already knew and love, but this is, of course, not what we want. Some examples:*A big space station is destroyed by a single fighter who enters it and shoots the main generator - destruction of the death stars*A shy race is talked into attacking a superior army  - ewok battle in ROTJ (and this new race was even more annoying than the ewoks)*Very fast pod racers drive through a canyon - speeder bike scene in ROTJA little more creativity for the next movie please, Mr Lucas. But the worst thing about the movie was the explanation of the force (this stupid blood test). It ruins the whole force story. I only hope Lucas will recognize this mistake and correct it in Episode 2.Ok, so what is left are good special effects, excellent light saber fighting, really good scenes with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan and, of course, the wonderful Darth Maul. That's not too much, but it justifies viewing this movie.Oh, by the way: Jar Jar must die! Soon!",7,0,1,18 August 1999
