Hereditary," Disturbing in a good way.
","Its atmosphere is reminiscent to the classic horror, and with plenty of impressive plot twists, solid scares and Toni Collette's terrific lead performance, it's a modern horror classic that will leave audiences thinking about its haunting ending for a long time.",8,0,2,13 June 2020
The Irishman," Great !!
",This film simply could not fail with such an incredible cast but it move at the pace of their leading men and it feels like it could have been 30 mins shorter. There are exceptional moments which tie everything together and the death scenes are incredibly well acted and shot. It is so close to being a class but it is hard to ignore the CGI especially when you can see the Arthritic movements of De Niro during a fight scene. Could it have been better no could it have been shorter yes,8,0,0,13 June 2020
The Conjuring 2," An effective, awesome, horror sequel that doesn't really rely on scares.
",This movie is one of my favorite horror films. The fact that both conjuring films are real makes it feel like you in the movie. It seems like nothing in the movie is CGI everything feels real. The nun amazing and terrifying and the fact that we all thought bill was the person haunting the place is awesome.,8,0,0,13 June 2020
