The Devil's Advocate," interesting movie
","It kept me glued to the sofa. Interesting confluence of ideas, the main one being the juxtaposition of the judeo-christian satan and the satan of the modern corporate world--the Big Law Firm, complete with gilded offices and views of central park. The commentor who said this was an interesting movie wrapped in a turkey is correct in a way: it could have been better. Keanu's accent of course is a major flaw.  And Pacino went over the top--less could have been more.  In a way the movie had too much style, not enough substance....",Null,1,1,11 December 2002
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Cliched and derivative, and yet...it works well!
","This one is derivative of _The_Natural_, with its strong undercurrents of magical realism, sports as mythical vehicle, and over-sentimentality, but it somehow works anyway. This film also indulges in touches of many American pop culture cliches, such as zen, meditation, etc. Good acting from Damon and the boy. Smith does a good job, too. THe actors who play Jones and Hagen also do fine jobs. THe actor who plays Jones, in particular, carries more than his share of the load, even though his lines are few.Great production values!",Null,1,3,3 July 2004
The Ring," Perhaps the best horror movie of all time
","Well, maybe not the very very best, but it has to be very close to it. Excellent pacing, visually hypnotic, tight tight plot, surreal atmosphere. It's right up there with Psycho and exorcist.OK, maybe it does have a some weaknesses. Maybe it depends a bit too much on built-in Hollywood horror mythology. It doesn't explain a lot, or offer any kind of substantive framework for how this happens. I mean this is all in the mind, in the realm of ghosts and psychic stuff. I mean, it works, and very well, but it could never happen.Really, horror movies like Psycho are better, because that could have actually happened.This movie is just way out there in ghostland.But the visual effect is simply tour de force stuff. A beautiful movie. Not all THAT original, like I said--in a way it depends on a huge framework of Hollywood horror clich√©s. But the visual world is alluring. Sort of reminds me of Jacob's Ladder, what with the way it slips from a totally realistic workaday world into surreal otherworld.",9,0,1,7 June 2005
The Big Lebowski," The Dude Abides....
","....Well, I don't about you, but I take comfort in that. insider jokesFor those who have not seen it, this movie is comfort food for the soul. See it ASAP.",10,0,1,10 December 2002
Rocky V," Not that bad a movie
","A lot of IMDb posters are kinda trashing this movie, and Rocky V ain't exactly The Deer Hunter or THe Seventh Seal, or anything like that, but this movie is better than the IMDb readers have rated it (4.0). It should be rated at least a 5.5 to 6.0.This movie has some stuff going for it: it has a good little storyline, with lots of local Philly flavor in it. Nice plot complications, if a little predictable. THe climax is also a bit predictable, but well done. Great production values and good music.THe Rocky movies in general have taken a lot of abuse, but Rocky V does not deserve the abuse it has gotten here. And it deserves better than a 4.0!",5,4,5,23 October 2004
Drive," a vacuous film for vacuous, empty-headed youth
","this movie caters to youth, callow youth, empty-headed youth...youngsters love to be flattered and be catered to...and that is what this movie does...so self-indulgent...oh, young people are so so so special...this movie drapes itself and its characters with so much indulgence...what is there? Nothing...",3,0,6,17 May 2017
A Quiet Place," 8/10 rating is bogus--fake reviews?
",This movie is stilted and boring...all atmosphere...and not much else...got about 15 minutes into it and gave up...but it has a 8/10 rating here...which tells me that there are a bunch of fake reviews...and that imdb is probably in on the game...,3,14,28,26 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The fake-Leftist Establishment Strikes Back with more anti-white-male propaganda
","This is a propaganda war, my fellow whites..the establishment empire wants to cram a billion or more nonwhite immigrants into america...and they are using propaganda to generate white guilt in order to get their way...and this movie is another propaganda effort from the establishment...never ever give a cent to hollywood...if you want to watch a movie use a streaming site",1,3,5,27 December 2017
The Godfather: Part III," Most movies are overrated in IMDb, but this one is underrated
","This movie is Rated a 7.2 here by IMDb voters; I feel it should be rated higher. Perhaps a 7.9, which might move it into the top 250 of all, and perhaps it deserves that.The ending of this movie is sterling, of the highest quality. Pacino really lets rip.The other actors? Sofia Coppola is, as others have pointed out, not all that great. Talia Shire? She was never that good, and she does an 'OK' job here. Both of those actresses got into movies via their relative, Francis Ford Coppola, who directed this film. Nepotism....it shows. How Talia Shire ever got as much work as she has, I will never know....Keaton is held back a bit in this movie, perhaps so as not to overshadow Pacino. Not one of her best performances.Andy Garcia? I am not all that big a fan. I think his performance here is overrated a little bit. He is a ham. And Pacino is, too. But he has something Garcia will never have.But many other rather good roles for a lot of great character actors, who perform well. Those character actors, along with Pacino, are the heart of this movie. That, and a very good script and production values and direction. Seamless direction!A high quality film. Almost as good a script as parts 1 and 2.I give it a 7.9.",10,157,297,13 December 2004
Enemy at the Gates," top notch war movie
","Absolutely top rate production values.Pacing is very good. Characters are pretty good.A mix of Hollywood techniques and European film-making. This gives it a slightly different feel than most Hollywood movies.Sets the scene/background fairly well.And as another reviewer pointed out, although the film take the point of view of the Russians, the movie goes out of its way to denigrate communism sufficiently to please the American neoliberal regime. Heavens knows what would happen these days to a film that actually portrayed socialism from a favorable perspective! I recommend it.",8,2,5,17 January 2005
Any Given Sunday," This movie will not disappoint!
","Another great movie from Oliver Stone.  Just one of many.
Complex and ambiguous characters living in a standard plot line but with many interesting details and twists.Great music! Nothing really to complain about.",10,1,2,1 September 2003
Trainspotting," so what's it all about, Alfie?
","Very good movie, and underrated here on imdb.But a movie this good has to be about something.  It has several themes, but maybe they are a bit hard to nail down.The writer of the novel upon which the movie is based was a man who dabbled in real estate, even before he 'made it.'  I think one of the themes is about 'making it.'  Also, one of the themes is the inevitablity of death, and why not make the most of it before death, which means getting the most pleasure from your body possible--and heroin is pleasurable, indeed (or so I hear...).And another theme is how immediate gratification is a dead end.",Null,0,1,5 October 2002
The Truman Show," really doesn't have much to do with reality shows
","Some IMDB reviewers of the Truman Show has suggested that this is a satire of reality shows.I disagree. It is much more a satire directed to Hollywood pretentiousness and egos.More importantly, it is mainly concerned with how we are programmed to accept societal perspectives and ideas without question.These are forced upon us, and they form a wall around our reality.  Breaking through that wall is what the Truman Show is all about.",10,2,4,15 March 2003
Braveheart," good movie, but it panders to Scots-Irish socio-politics of America
","This movie is a well made and rousing movie. It is a gritty movie.And it taps deeply into the Scots-Irish socio-political background of America. And I would know--I am an American of mostly Scots-Irish descent.The Scots-Irish socio-politics is maybe the biggest single problem with America, and the biggest problem with the world, at least right now.There is a massive reservoir of cultural stupidity in the Scots-Irish culture. You can see it ALL OVER this movie. It is central to this movie. What it is, is the idea that fighting and dying for this ephemeral concept, freedom, is a Good Thing. What a sad sad idea that really is. Better to live and sabotage and fight a low profile cultural fight, rather than fight and die as they did in this movie.Unfortunately, the Scots Irish has bought into this fantasy time and time again. But throughout history, it has never been the brave warrior-patriot-citizen who has exhorted the Scots-Irish and the American people to war for fight for 'freedom.' No, indeedy. Instead, it has been the rich, the powerful, and the corporations who have used this subterfuge in order to persuade the SCots Irish to fight and die. Corporate profits and more riches and estates for the wealthy have almost always been disguised as 'freedom.' Those Scots Irish wound up immigrating to America, and now they form the base of the Republican party. And now we have yet another faux warrior-patriot-citizen in George Bush, exhorting the Scots Irish to die for freedom. And once again, they are falling for the manipulation. Well, at least most of them. But not this old Scots-Irish....",7,6,13,1 February 2005
Donnie Darko," What a fantastic movie
","Well, as I write this, there are over 1200 comments already below mine regarding this movie. And not surprisingly,either. This one is a good one, and quite unique. A couple of distinguishing characteristics of this movie, briefly:1. Atmosphere: masterful, a tour de force display of creating atmosphere. This kid ought to be hired to make a movie from every Stephen King novel there is. What Stephen King does for atmosphere in his books, Kelly has done in Darko.2. Excellent realism with an ensemble cast. He manages to humanize secondary characters in a very short time. In fact, some of the secondary characters seem almost to be there only to create a sort of verisimilitude with respect to a human environment.  The movie feels more lifelike because there are secondary characters whose function seems mostly unrelated to the plot, yet who are rather well drawn and fleshed out, nonetheless. Or rather, many of the secondary characters are fleshed out in ways that have nothing to do with the plot. This movie is quite Australian, in that regard: it has a large ensemnble cast where many of the characters seem to actually live lives of their own, independent of the central plotline.",10,1,2,19 August 2004
