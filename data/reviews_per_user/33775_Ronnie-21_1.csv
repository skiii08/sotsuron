Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This movie rocked bigtime!
","Although I am a huge movie fan, I did not expect to be blown away by this movie so much so, that I went and saw it a second time, and I want to see it a third.  This movie was one great movie.  I can't understand why the acting was criticized.  It was the best ensemble I've seen in such a long time. Casting seven/eight year old Jake Lloyd was simply brilliance on the casting directors part.  He conveyed 'the chosen one' very well and sent little chills up my spine knowing that he would soon, in later episodes, turn into Darth Vader.  Ewan McGregor was great and so was Natalie Portman.  Her as Queen Amidala was wonderful.  So was Jar Jar Binks.  For those of you who walked out before the credits ended, you missed out on something wonderful. After the last scene of credits rolled, before the fade out you can hear Darth Vader breathing.  What a wonderful way to end it!!!",Null,0,0,18 June 1999
