The Expendables 2," Everybody can have a guilty pleasure? Right?
","Yes, I know this film is stupid, dumb and I can easily see why some people hate this movie. However, it's just so damn fun & likable that I just can't resist it. I'm just a sucker for old school action films and to get so many of the great badasses in the film and put them in a genuinely gripping story, well there's just nothing wrong with that. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Statham, Crewes, and everyone else are back and they are all better. The fight scenes in this film kick ass, it's not as over the top as the previous film and that makes it more engaging. There are great cameos by the likes of Willis as well as new appearances by legends like Chuck Norris and Liam Hemsworth. Jean Claude Van Damme plays the villain & you can tell he is loving every minute of it. The only problems I have with the film are, I would have liked to have seen more of the villains being badass and doing badass things. Also, I would have liked to have seen more badasses, get Liam Neeson in there, get Michael Jai White, get Tony Ja. Overall. The Expendables 2 is really stupid but it's more fun than it is stupid.",7,0,0,31 March 2015
Skyfall," Its, been called the best Bond film of all time? ... Ummm
","Let me describe this film in one word...Boaring, I have given this film so many chances but every time I watch this film I just end up falling a sleep, this is by far one of the dullest films I have ever sat through.First of all, I am not a Daniel Craig fan. I'm sure he's a nice man and I think its wonderful how much he does for charity, but as an actor, he dosen't do a thing for me at all, he's a modern day Chuck Norris. And here he is no different, when I think of James Bond, I think of James Bond I think of a smart, charismatic and witty. Craig just stands there and says vague stuff.The film is also way too long, but I guess we live in a world where directors feel like they have to make action films 3 hours long. None of the characters were interesting, in fact, I barley remember what their names or objectives were.The only remotely interesting thing I remember was Javier Bardem as the villain. He was just a typical over the top bad guy, and he was just fun to watch. He was cool but he could'nt save the film, and his plot was really forgettable.Some fight scenes were cool, but I will be honest, not only is this film overrated, it's pretty bad.",3,6,12,28 April 2015
Training Day," King Kong ain't got sh*t on this movie !!!
","One thing I will say about this film is that it has some of the best one liners ever put on film. I would say that you would have to watch this film for the one liners that Alonzo (Played by Denzel Washington) spills.The film as itself is a lot of fun but it still has some flaws. Overall praise has to go to Denzel Washington, who is loving every minute of his performance as the villain. He does all the villain clichés, smiling, laughing and ranting, things you just love to see villains do. However, they don't just make him bad, the brilliant writing also makes him a complex character, giving a twisted morale compass. You actually question his sanity because, despite all the evil things he does, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, its performances like this that remind me why Denzel Washington is my favorite actor and can do almost no wrong.The film also does well at setting atmosphere, you really get a sense of these places in fact I even read that they had filmed in areas such as Compton. The appearances by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were awesome and well place and I loved the Latino gangsters that Hoyte has to face at the end of the film, one of them played by Cliff Cirtus who I believe can play any ethnic group.However, I do have one issue with the film and that is its secondary character, Hoyte, played by Ethan Hawke. Don't get me wrong, I will take nothing away from Hawke's performance but they made the character of Hoyte so bland and predictable, the goody goody, always does right and I know thats what they were going for but they could have made him more interesting, maybe he is tempted by Alonzo and almost turns to the dark side or at the end of the film, something to make him more complex, particularly after all he has gone through.Overall, if you like cop/crime thrillers then you will definitely enjoy this, if you want something with a lot of depth this may not be for you but hey, watch and make your own conclusion.",7,3,4,15 April 2015
Finding Nemo," Do I even need to talk about why this movie rocks ?
","Well, apart from possibly, say, the Toy Story films, Finding Nemo has taken the world by storm as Pixar's biggest hit. And to be honest, it deserves that credit.First of all, this is up there with 'Basil' as one of the mist f***ed up openings for a kids film. I mean, you open up with a mother all but one of her offspring being eaten by a vicious predator. I like kids films that can do that, not always trying to be family friendly. Apart from that, the film is really awesome.The strength from the film comes from its characters, there are too many to count and normally that would hurt a film but here, there are all so different and memorable. Albert Brooks is great as Merlin, who, in my opinion, is one of the great film dads. You really end up feeling for this guy and yeah he can be annoying in how introverted and protected he is but its all coming from a place of legitimate pain that the audience is introduced to early on, thus you are put on his journey. Dory is freaking hilarious. You'd think the memory loss story line would get old but it is cleverly worked in so that it is fresh in every situation. The other characters are all so fun and none of them were annoying, you enjoyed watching all of them. The additional voice talents of Willem Dafoe, Geoffry Rush, Eric Bana and many others help the cause as well. My favorite characters where the turtles, that is just how I have always envisioned turtles speaking.The film is set in modern day Australia, again using modern day settings (and a unique one at that) and there is no feeling of manipulations. You never feel that the film is trying to be 'cool' no need for catch phrases or pop cultural references, just a new setting that allows for some nice shots. The film still has a timeless feel.If I had one issue with the film, its that the climax feels a little forced. Without giving away too much, there is an incident that happens at the end where a character tries to prove themselves and it just didn't feel needed.Overall, Finding Nemo is one of my favorite animated films ever and is fit for kids, teens, adults, hell its just fit for the whole family.",9,2,3,15 April 2015
Don Jon," Pleasant Surprises are always nice
","This is one of those films where you have a really stupid story line, but end up with a surprisingly well written, touching and enjoyable film! Firstly, I loved the script and the story. On a personal level, I've never been great at relationships and used to be self conscious about it, and to see the journey our protagonist goes on to the morale where you realize that true love is not just all about sex, and its not about being overly romantic either but, love in relationships is about a genuine understanding between two people, and I feel that is a moral we can all agree with and relate to. Also, the film was also surprisingly funny in certain areas, funny because some of the situations are fairly reliable and also because the actors in the film (none of whom you'd particularly associate with comedy) just have brilliant comedic timing. The star of the film was without doubt, Scarlet Johansson; not only is she hot beyond belief but she is just so manipulative, and a down right bitch that I actually, don't like her anymore, it's just such a contrast to the way she normally plays her characters. The way the film is edited is also clever as you do not see to much graphic elements from the porn but you still know what he is watching.However, there were a few elements that I did not see the point to. For example, Brie Larsson's character did not need to be in the film, at all. She makes numerous appearances in the film but only has one speaking point at the end and by this point, the point she is making is well established. In fact, it would have been more effective if the main character, Jon, had made the statement as it involves his story, but having a character in the film for the sake of making one point is not effective. Also, there were aspects that were not very clear, for example when he picks playing basketball with strangers over going to the gym, scenes like that that could have been cut as it was not clear what they were meant to represent. Its aspects like that that cause the film that stop me from really loving this film but DON JON still a solid film and I would recommend it as it gives a very effective view on modern day relationships. If this is Levitt's first directorial film, I hope it is the first of many.",7,0,1,10 April 2015
American Sniper," Controversy aside, Is this a good film, YES !!!
","Putting aside the controversy that surrounds this film, I would defend it as one of the best films of 2015.My hat of to Bradley Cooper, who just gets better with every film he is in. Respect to his gym gains, to go from the tall and slender man we all know to the bulky bad ass can't have been easy and is one of the best actor transformations I have ever seen. He gets the character down perfectly, in fact, there were times I did'nt even think I was watching Bradley Cooper, I felt as thou I was watching the real Chris Kyle.The film's atmosphere was great. This probably the most intense war film I have seen since Glory (1989). There are scenes where the stakes are so high, you feel like you could faint at any moment. The film wasn't trying to make you feel anything, it just showed you what happened in the war for what it was.OK, I know the film didn't touch on certain aspects of Kyle's character but in some ways I don't feel its relevant. In my opinion, I don't feel that this man is portrayed as a hero, he is a man who felt he was doing his duty but eventually it got the best of him. Not in a sympathetic way, but in a realistic way.Overall, this is not a history lesson. Its a film, and a damn good one.",8,37,69,20 April 2015
Ratatouille," Rats ! In the Kitchen !
","As you read in the summary, (for those of you who haven't seen this film) that is pretty much the tagline for this film, and it works, for the most part, the film definitely has a few flaws.My biggest problem with the film, is that its too long and there is way to much going on. You have all these characters being squeezed in (like all the chefs and the rat characters) and I will be the first to say, that without giving too much away, there are certain plot lines that are just not needed, particularly one about certain characters being related and it did not amount to anything in the end, which pretty much proves that it was pointless.That is a fairly big flaw as I kept checking my phone to check how long the film had left. Also, surprisingly, I felt that, because there are so may different story lines, I felt like I never got to see that much of the characters, I liked Remy and I wanted to see more of him, it is his story. I would have liked to have seen more of Linguini and I feel that the romance he has with Colette was a bit rushed and could have been more developed.However, the film's saving grace is the animation and the atmosphere. The animation is incredible, some of the best I've ever seen. All the scenes that involve a view of the city at night all look like something out of a beautiful painting, I mean I could have stared at it forever. The characters (despite being underdeveloped) are still a lot of fun, the villain is freaking gold and Colette also gets some funny lines in. Remy is a great character and I loved the scenes where he is experimenting with food.I will not dare give away the ending, one of the best endings in film if you ask me, I didn't expect it and it was heart warming. The inner thoughts of the critic (Peter O'Toole) at the end was one of the best movie monologues ever. It was touching, and thought provoking when it comes to judging art or even people.Overall the film has a few problems but the stuff thats good is really good and outways the bad stuff my a long shot. I've seen this film many times in the past and will see it many times in the future.",7,0,0,28 April 2015
Selma," A film that tells you how to feel.
","Yeah, this film is the very definition of the term 'average.' I will not take anything away from David Oyelowo's performance. I didn't see an actor playing a role, I saw Dr. King. The supporting cast did well enough and I did enjoy the song by Common and John Legend.However, where the film fell a little flat for me was that, though this depicts true events, is that it followed so many of the Hollywood clichés such as slowing down a shot during a violent scene, telling the audience what to feel and when to feel it and that annoys me, particularly in a historical film because it is so unnecessary. I don't dislike the film, its a well put together film, I was just a little underwhelmed. It's absolutely worth watching but anyone expecting to see something as good as say '12 years a slave' will be disappointed.As for the Oscar snub, well, based on the film I've seen, it really didn't deserve that much attention from the Academy, regardless of the topic it deals with. Films should receive Oscars for quality not subject matter.Overall, a good film, not a great one.",6,3,6,11 April 2015
The Lion King," Gets better with age !
","The highest grossing 2D animated film of all time, one of the most critically acclaimed movies ever, a smash hit. And it deserves every bit of praise. The Lion King not only stands the test of time but it actually gets better as time goes on. One of the film's (many) strong points is its characters. Simba is very likable, as a cub he's wide eyed, curious, can be cocky but it all comes from a good place. As an adult he is fun loving but conflicted by the pain of his past. Scar is one of the greatest film villains of all time. He's cunning & manipulative but is also cowardly and somewhat petulant (as shown when he takes over). He is also one of the few Disney villains to kill off one of the main characters. The side characters are also great, I know everyone talks about Timon & Pumba but I think the hyenas are the funniest part of the film. James Earl Jones is great as Mufasa, who in my opinion is one of the greatest movie dads of all time. The songs, who hasn't heard them? They're all great, catchy & memorable. If I had to not pick it would be elements such as, why does the rain come back when Simba wins, but that's just Disney logic. The Lion King is the greatest animated film of all time and only gets better with age.",10,1,2,30 March 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," My Faivorate Movie Ever
","Without doubt, this is my favorite film of all time.Every time I watch this film I feel like its the first time. Its just fantastic.The heart of the film is the performances; Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both terrific in their roles and the chemistry between them is so genuine it wouldn't surprise me if they were friends before making the film. It also has the best use of Morgan Freeman's narration voice, I almost felt like someone was in there telling the story to me. Bob Gunton was great as well as the rest of the supporting cast.Overall, I'm just in love with the story, I love films that involve someone being faced with a bad situation and are able to turn their life around. In my opinion, this is the best use of that method of film making.Shawshank Redemption is a great film, my favorite in fact and I would recommend it to anyone.",10,0,0,27 March 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Yes, Yes, Yes
","This film was awesome. I'm always skeptical of films that win Best Picture, but this one totally deserved it.It's a unique idea and it's really well acted, I mean, really, really well acted. Michael Keaton was AMAZING as Riggan. You can tell he put his absolute all into his performance. You really, sympathize with this character, this guy who really just wants another shot at his career, another shot at life. He sees this play as his second chance and he's determined not to let anything get in the way of making it and making it good. You also get really involved in the other characters. Edward Norton was amazing as this method actor, God he is a penis !!!! He was so obnoxious, the actor who just thinks he knows best, and God, I have met a whole bunch of people who are just like that. Emma Stone...how could you go wrong with her ? The writing of the film is really well written. The idea of the voice inside the head was awesome. That just continues this emphasis that this guy is really loosing his grip on reality after the birdman character (who was a huge part of this mans life) was taken out of his life.If I had any problem with the film, and it would be a minor one. It's that I don't get the ending, and I know it's meant to be open for interpretation but I just didn't get it and I'm going to need an art film fan...guy to explain it to me. But thats more of a nit pick.Overall, this is one of the best films I've seen in the last couple of years.",9,2,6,21 April 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Never judge a book by its cover.
","I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking 'wow that looks stupid' but as the film got more & more positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. And, it was better than I could have ever expected. The films strongest point is it's comedy. The film takes every opportunity to make the audience laugh and all the jokes are spot on. The cast were superb, Taron Egerton as the lead was great and I hope to see more of him in the future. The rest of the cast were awesome (Firth, Caine etc) and Samuel L. Jackson plays one of the funniest villains ever put on film, at first I thought it was going to be annoying to give him a lisp but no, it had me rolling on the floor. If I had any issues with the film, I'd only say that the fight scenes can be a little too over the top & that can be a little distracting at times. Overall, Kingsman is a great film and I'd even go as far as to say it's one of the best comedies in the last 10 years. Its clearly satirizing the James Bond films but this is how satirical films should be done. Humour, a good story and a lot of heart and memorable characters. There are talks of a sequel and I'm all for that.",8,2,8,6 April 2015
Goodfellas," How do you define a classic? You watch this film !
","I remember that this is one of the first films that I've ever seen that deserved to be called a 'classic.' I was absolutely mind blown, I was even shocked that the film is two and a half hours long but had just been sucked in for so long.This film has some of the best acting you will ever see in your life. Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci (who deserved his Oscar), Robert De Nero, Lorraine Bracco. Everybody was fantastic ! Everyone just deserved an Oscar. Ray Liotta and and Lorraine both gave effective and entertaining voice over narration and even the smaller roles from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson where entertaining.The music was incredible, there is no score, its more of a combination of famous songs from the 50's 60's and 70's (matching the decades in which the film is set) and they all work, none of the songs feel shoe-horned, and they all pleasant to listen to.This is Scorsese's best work, which is a big claim, and well earned. The shots were all great, including the tracking shot that has now become world famous and is taught in film schools all over the world. The use of lighting, the atmosphere were all at a level of perfection that only Scorsese can.This is one of my favorite films of all time.",10,1,1,28 April 2015
Furious 7," A good send off to Paul Walker, but was it a good movie ?
","Man, I got to tell you, I was pleasantly surprised by the last two Fast and the Furious films and when I went to see this one, I was really excited, when I saw it....eh? I mean, yeah, the film is decent. I guess my biggest problem with the film is the lack of story. There is so much story that is substituted for needless chase and explosions, and I know that is kind of the point of the Fast and Furious franchise but in the last two films, what worked was the development of the characters as well as the introduction and development of new characters and villains such as Hobbs or Shaw.Here, you are promised prominent Hollywood bad asses, Jason Statham, Tony Jaa and Djmion Honsou (one of my favorite actors) and they get no development and are all shoehorned into several different plot lines that add up to nothing more than a few fight scenes that you honestly don't care about. Also, the film really exploits how much it can get away with in terms of action, they did it before but here it gets somewhat distracting. I hear Denzel Washington turned down Kurt Russell's role and with the way he is written, I can see why. He was REALLY ANNOYING.The film's one saving grace is its ending. I won't give it away but it is a very heart warming send off to Paul Walker, and you can feel it was coming from the hearts of his co-stars. They also dealt with the CGI of Paul Walker's face very well.Overall, Fast 7 is a fun film, a popcorn film and you probably won't want to watch it again.",5,4,21,20 April 2015
