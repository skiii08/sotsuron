The Ring," A great package of scares--and some lifted shots from Hitchcock classics
","Contains Spoilers I have to admit that 'The Ring' scared me.  Plot holes and all it was very well shot with great directing, excellent camera shots, a disturbing mood, and above-average acting.  Without discussing the plot in any detail I must say that I am surprised that of the reviews I read of this movie, not a single person noticed the several camera shots lifted from other movies, especially Hitchcock films.  First, the scene where the boy's mother scans the neighboring apartment complex observing the various lives of her neighbors she visually moves from window to window observing the scenes inside several different apartments.  This scene was directly taken from 'Rear Window' and as a humorous nod to Hitchcock, one of the neighbors even had a broken leg and is confined to wheelchair, just like Jimmy Stewart was in 'Rear Window.'  However in 'The Ring' we see him from another neighbor's vantage point.  Two other shots were clear references to 'Vertigo.'  The sudden and unexpected suicide jump of Kim Novak into the San Francisco Bay is copied as the girl's mother suddenly, and unexpectedly jumps from the cliff in 'The Ring.'  Also, when the video expert is in his room and the female lead decides to forgo the elevator and race up the stairs, the shot is also right out of 'Vertigo' as Jimmy Stewart races up the stairs of the bell tower.  The stairs wind around in a dizzying spiral and the camera is even positioned in the same spot for both shots.  Another shot taken from Hitch was when the female lead is showering and her dirt is washing down the drain.  The camera zooms in on the drain following the rinsed-off dirt as it disappears, exactly as Hitchcock did in 'Psycho' during Janet Leigh's shower scene.  Another shot lifted from 'Psycho' was when the female lead approaches the video expert's chair from behind calling out his name towards the end of the movie.  She touches his chair and it slowly turns around to reveal his face--exactly as it does at the end of 'Psycho' when Vera Miles learns the truth about Norman's 'mother.'  That many shots from Hitchcock movies does take away a bit from the originality of 'The Ring', but a good shot is a good shot even if used more than once.  Additionally, the scene where the fingernail is found in the walls of the well could not have been more clearly lifted from 'Silence of the Lambs.'  While each movie had their own plot and reasons for each shot, it is interesting to note how blatantly some shots were stolen from the masters.  Otherwise, I greatly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any who are tired of ridiculous attempts at horror such as 'Scream,' 'I Know What You Did Last Summer,' and '13 Ghosts.'",Null,0,0,28 October 2002
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," I am stunned into absolute silence!
","Prior to attending a showing of 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' I consulted the IMDb as I always do to see what other viewers thought of the movie. I was pleased to see it received 7 our of 10 stars. Now after seeing this piece of trash I will be forever skeptical of the rankings viewers give movies on this site. I never thought I would cry in this movie but I did. I cried when I realized I wasted $8 on this piece of crap. There were plenty of jokes and a lot of gags but none of them worked. NONE of them made me laugh. In fact the entire theater of about 80 customers sat in silence throughout this movie. Generally ANY movie will have one or two morons that laugh at every profanity or every drug reference, but this movie never elicited a single audible laugh from ANYONE in the theater. I cannot believe that one reviewer even compared it to 'This is Spinal Tap'--a movie I consider one of the funniest and most innovative of the past thirty years. This was definitely NO 'Spinal Tap'!!! The site gags were not funny, the set ups for most jokes were ridiculous, and the pay-offs simply didn't work. I could tell that on paper these jokes must have appeared hilarious but on the big screen they simply fell flat. Granted, there were a couple of catchy tunes, but if that is all you are looking for, simply buy the soundtrack and save yourself the ordeal of sitting through two hours of torture. I gave this movie 1 star only because IMDb didn't allow me to actually give it MINUS points--which it deserved. AVOID at all costs.",1,20,48,27 December 2007
It Follows," A Great Idea But Disappointing
","(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS)I am baffled at the gushing reviews given for this movie. Granted the IDEA is superb, I loved the idea behind the plot but the movie overall was a disappointment for me. The camera work, which at first was brilliant, soon lost credibility with so many shots that added NOTHING to the plot and were distracting and misleading. Generally a camera shot should contribute to the plot by offering clues, establishing location, mood, or suspense, but multiple camera shots led NOWHERE and became a distraction. After three or four camera shots led to zero payoff, the director lost credibility. Also, the plot established that those following the victims of the curse would always be walking, but then we see one of those shown earlier as walking, suddenly now shows up on a bike. Also the reason why certain people were 'followers' is never fleshed out in the plot, with some being dressed, some naked, or partially naked, some just stood (as the man on the house) and NEVER walked at all which we were previously told was a clue as to the nefarious intent of the follower. This plot needs to tie together those that are the followers with those that are followed. In one scene a male 'follower' enters a house but the murder is carried out by a female. I WILL admit it is an idea that stays with you after you leave the theater and I DID find myself paying attention to people walking towards my direction outside the theater, but overall I was disappointed with many aspects of this film.Sorry.",6,3,44,27 March 2015
JFK," History for the poorly read and the easily duped
","This comment is really TWO comments: One of Oliver Stone's movie itself and a second one on the premise of the film.First: The film is excellent in telling the story of the various theories surrounding the assassination. Recreated scenes are interwoven with archival film footage so seamlessly that only historical scholars can detect where Dallas ends and Hollywood begins. But for the well read scholar that line is very clear. I enjoy the movie itself. It is a bit long and would bore those without a fairly elaborate background with the details of the assassination and the various plots that have been hatched.Second: Concerning the historical accuracy of the film. There is none. The only accurate facts are that Kennedy was assassinated, Oswald was shot, and the nation mourned. Everything else is suspect. There is not time here to dissect the film to the degree I would like, besides several websites have already done that much better than I could. The premise of several different gunmen firing up to six or more shots it totally unsubstantiated with ANY credible evidence. The allegations that Kennedy planned to pull out of Vietnam are not accepted by ANY respected historian in the United States. The theory that Oswald and Ruby were involved together is laughable since no evidence exists to support this fanciful theory.In short, the movie should have been named, 'Dallas in Wonderland', but Oliver's twist is fun to rip apart.",5,5,20,2 April 2007
