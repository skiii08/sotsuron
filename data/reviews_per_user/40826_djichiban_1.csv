Hereditary," The most outstanding, insane horror movie i've ever watched
","Let me tell you something, i watch many horror films, i get scared often, but its fun. Watching horror movies is often fun to most people watching them, laughing after they were scared because the atmosphere softens up after that for some time. But Hereditary is not fun to watch at all. It makes you feel really uncomfortable and shocks you, though jumpscares are just used a few times. If you are sensitive to horror, jumpscares and are terrifyied easily, dont watch it! Its really stressing. I remember me and my friend not talking to each other for a few minutes after we finished watching it. It is a really good, and innovative movie, dont get me wrong. The acting is on point, the DP did a great job and the story is told really good. ( i am really just curios how the writers got the idea for this insane plot)
You need to ask yourself whether you want to do this to you, like i said for the average person it is not fun to watch.",10,3,6,2 August 2019
