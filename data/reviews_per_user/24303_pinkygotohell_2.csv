It," This movie can take IMDB 7.4 points... Do you give high scores just because it is a well-known novel adaptation?
","You will also float... What bad publicity text? Very scary? No! What is this useless monster? Is this the story of The Powerpuff Girls playing monsters? Stupid to be incredible! Is it because it is a super famous novel adaptation, so everyone will give it a high score? IMDB 7.4 ?????Ok, it's true that the children's acting is good.",2,0,4,28 July 2019
Us," Playing with mystery, satire, just to show off the depth of self-righteousness
","It's fun to put a bunch of metaphors, but regardless of the rationality and logic of the story, people are very vomiting. But the director thinks it is deep. In the end, only a bunch of incomprehensible and contradictory questions are left, which are unrelated to the end. Please! Don't stop metaphoring again? Super hate this Easter egg culture!",3,1,4,28 July 2019
