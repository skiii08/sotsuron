Hereditary," A movie about worshipping Pokemon
","As well as irritatingly dragged pace (even when playing it at 1.5 speed), it seem that main characters instructed to annoy you as hell with their cliches. But that's not unexpected, all main characters in today's american movies usually are a$$holes.Only in this movie you can watched a young adult continuosly whining and crying like a baby. It seemed fake of course, because it was over-dramatically fake.And turned out in the end, all they wanted is just to worship The Great Pokemon, what the fudge?",1,4,8,11 September 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Movie title was mistakenly swapped with Marvel's
","More properly titled as Suicide Squad, whereas the Marvel's should be called as Rogue Ones, nobody really got hurt in the Marvel's movie.
It's pretty good action movie with somewhat (not much) believable characters you could concerned at, about 7.5/10 if I would rate it.
But I don't like depressed ending with all those characters are dead, or as my kid said: 'a sad happy ending'. It sucks.",8,0,0,1 January 2018
Justice League," There you go again, DC.
","Beware, this is a DC movie. And like *nearly* all of them (movies + TV series) they're supposed to be dim-witted or just plain stupid. We don't mind to bend a bit common sense for outstanding action like in Marvel's (for example: acrobat fightings rather than just disabled the bad guy), but in DC's they're simply stupid cliches I can't even believe they'd passed it through.Especially if you're a DC comics lover/nerd, you'll be severely dissapointed. Like Superboy in DC's TV series, he is not a nice scout-boy, but a mentally weak super-jerk, angry psycho who doesn't hesitate sacrificing the whole world to make his sweet-hart smile (what a romantic guy isn't he?). That kind of logic is versatile in all DC movies, so I didn't have too much confident as well in this movie (Justice League 2017).And indeed my expectation sure prevails. If not because of Gal Gadot, maybe this movie deserved a negative rating.And Lois Lane. Though this time is not utterly annoying like Reeve's Superman, why are they always cast an ugly and stupid Lois Lane?",6,2,3,19 February 2018
Batman Begins," Pretentious and stupid
","Like all DC movies/TV shows, this one also as stupid as the other.Here's my advice: Get Asian guy to write about eastern culture. Western people tried to describe East-wisdom will always ended being _cringy_ stupid, just like all pretentious David Carradine movies/TV shows.DC *really* need to get more decent writers for their movies/TV shows.",1,0,5,16 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Betrays old Stars Wars fans, INTENTIONALLY.
","It literally said: 'It's time to let old things die'.This is a Disney's movie with Disney's movie logic.
It didn't even pretended as a continuation from old SW movies despite bearing SW name and old casts (which all eventually killed/died anyway).Seeing a freshness but shallow thought (or lack of it), the movie writers are young I guess. You might be able to depict something more powerful, but never a wiser thought than you already are.Like any other recent movies, they're also copying Game of Thrones style: killing some key characters prematurely. While it works in GOT, of course, lack of originality make it just another cliche, a cheap shock/sensation in this movie.To be fair, it's actually a good action movie for someone who has yet seen or invented on previous SW movies. But never expect the same vibe, legacy or even coherency with old SW canon, it's next to nothing.Rating: 7.5/10 if you are new generation, 3/10 if you are old SW fans.",1,1,2,26 December 2017
Black Panther," Dumb, stupid movie
","Almost all negros in this stupid movie are overacting or simply dumb and you don't even have to be smart to see it. Only the black villain acted natural, but the character he played also pretty stupid.The director and writer's IQ must be below average. The scene that naughty princess giving her finger to crown princess in front of everyone, an absurdity like that can be allowed only by lowest born people whose never have any slight decency/direction from their parents plus also stupid.",2,4,6,4 February 2019
Mother!," Pretentious. Infuriating self indulgence.
","The movie started with some pedophile likeness, pretty young girl (Jennifer Lawrence) and an old guy (Javier Barden aka. discount Nicolas Cage). How the movie seems to encourage pedophilia was make me sick, maybe there's a reson behind this, but I started to dislike it and ticked down my rating.
As usual, JL played an awkward incompetent pretty girl, oblivious absent-minded, disctracting and panting most of the time. She strangely attracted to an old guy (discount Nicolas Cage), also incompetent and doesn't really care of anything outside his dream world.
The couple didn't have any proper communication between them (make you wonder why they had even fell in love in the first place), that and some coincidents lead to a cliche misfit situation and more coincidents which dragged soo long you'd felt itches on your stomach.
If you weren' nauseating enough, then the good 'ol camera shaking (which doesn't have a slight justification for a drama like this), will make sure you to dislike this movie even more.
Turned out at the end of the movie, the guy is Merlin's descendant, distant cousin of Voldemort and graduated with highest praise from Hogwart. Yes, this movie is that silly.",4,9,16,12 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It's a big BS
","One word summary: *stupid*I came to conclusion that DC movies, including TV shows (superboy/smallville) are all stupid, or at least intended to market audience for kid under 9 years old.It's miles away behind MARVEL's productions.I guess I will never bother to watched them again in theater, just download or copy from friend should I wanted to waste my time.To be fair, wonder woman was quite watchable though, the writing is not as stupid as the other.",1,2,8,16 November 2017
