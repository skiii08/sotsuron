Come and See," Come and See this movie!
","Come and See is a movie title as well as an instruction to anyone who hasn't seen the movie!I think a lot of different opinions and ideas come out of watching such a violent and brutal film at this, many say that the movie is a true depiction of war. But regardless what you think or say, there is little chance you will be able to see this movie without interest. Whether it is sheer horror or sympathy, this is a must see!Without saying too much about the plot and story, the movie follows young man Florya and his struggle in war-time Byelorussia. Chilling depictions, beautiful photography, and horrible yet (sometimes) lovely storyline makes for an enthralling adventure for all.A caution for all: do not watch this movie if you are not ready to question life as you know it.",8,1,1,5 June 2010
