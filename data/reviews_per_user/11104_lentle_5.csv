Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates of the Long-Winded, Dull and Disappointing Caribbean
","This film started perfectly, first 30 minutes really got you into the action/adventure genre and had a few great ambitious, action sequences, and from there, possibly one of the most drawn-out films I've ever seen. I felt it was dull, rushed but drawn-out at the same time? The middle hour was SO DULL, the 'mermaids' (pathetic ones) and 'zombies' (in it for minutes) didn't add anything, and considering the first Pirates film is one of my all-time favourites, they've gotten progressively worse, and I really thought this one would bring back the terror of no.3.Such a disappointment, the trailer gave it all away too; Penelope Cruze was meh, and Johnny Depp looked like he wanted to be somewhere else.",3,1,2,29 September 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," NOT for a mainstream audience - too long, awful flowing problems and too many things going on!
","This film was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. Probably the worst film I've seen this year so far...Firstly, the acting in this was excellent in places however it couldn't grab me because the film was directed so poorly. I've never, ever seen a film skip from place to place so quickly when its audience just needs to stop for a moment and grasp what's actually happening! The amount of random scenes that are so misplaced too is extremely irritating and the constant long-pauses of speech made me think why I was watching it.The film didn't flow either, when it finished I didn't feel like the film had a beginning, middle or end, nor a climax or anything or substance that I'll remember.There was not one scene I remember from the film very well, no good quotes, no memorable twists, nothing. Don't get me wrong, the sceneries are filmed well, but that's not what this film needs - it needs the development of characters (who there are too many of who don't get enough screen time to adapt).Terrible, terrible film.",2,8,14,4 February 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A stunning, exciting and fast journey
","Coming from a huge Potter fan, this film is one of my all time favourites.For me, I felt that this film was a correction on what all of the other films partly missed, I felt there was enough drama, horror and surely, action. The film has beautiful locations and mind-blowing special effects that keep the series still yearning for more (which the second part shall reveal).I felt the acting was perfect, I wish there was more of Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman, but I'm sure they shall both shine in the latter part.I cannot hope but wish that Part 2 is bigger, better and more epic than Part 1, which is just possible.",10,1,4,30 May 2011
X-Men: First Class," X Men: First Class
","X Men: First Class is a real comeback for a franchise that could of, but didn't, loose its original 'shi-bang' as it were. This new addition to the series has brought it back to life, and back better than ever, this instalment is by far the best with fantastic acting, superb directing and mind-blowing action.Not only does this film deliver a new, untold story, but it also caters for those non-X Men fans with funny lines, character development and plays at a fast and exciting pace. This addition also ties up various loose ends that the previous films (although chronologically latter films) didn't answer, with the odd joke along the way.Not forgetting the cameo with Wolverine, that was fabulous, I doubt that was cheap.X Men: First Class has a franchise of its own, and I hope to see another soon.",7,3,8,1 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A mind-blowing and emotional finale!
","Seven films have led up to this eighth film, and every film has teased what the Battle of Hogwarts now presents to us, an all-out war between Hogwarts' students and teachers, and Voldermort and his trusty death eaters.The film begins with a break-in into the wizarding bank Gringotts, and Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix) imitates Hermione (Emma Watson) perfectly. The 3D works brilliantly as we sail thousands of feet under ground to the depths of the bank where the Lestrange vault is hidden. This is by far one of the superior action pieces of the film, including the dragon flight which shows how well 3D can work, although others, it cannot.The Battle of Hogwarts was also superb. Everyone reunited and no one is holding back, and neither does it feel like David Yates was either, it doesn't seem like they were trying to make the battle too 'kiddy', because it really does show the blood and sweat that leak out of these characters.For me, Maggie Smith really stood out for me, and her attack against Severus Snape was perfect, the effects were stunning.The epilogue too was very touching, it had emotion, class and humour and stemmed far away from being too cheesy (which the book slightly was).Overall, a brilliant finale, I shall treasure this film for a very, very long time.",10,0,3,16 July 2011
