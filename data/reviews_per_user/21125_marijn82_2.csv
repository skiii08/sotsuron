Skyfall," Jason bourne vs two face
","First of all it is a decent action movie, but that is about it. It would be even better if they removed the James Bond completely. Why call it James Bond if you remove the gadgets the cars and the girls. (prob. to get better sales..)A radio and a personal gun? Budget for Gadgets was only enough to place 4 leds on a fake gun and buy a toy radio? And then re-use an old bond car? Was there no budget to get a Aston martin one 77? The hacking stuff was boring and full of plot holes, they obvious did not have a budget for a decent evil lair (that island was fake and the room with the servers was cheap) so they used the digital terrorist as an excuse. Moneypenny was boring and way to ugly for a decent bond girl. James being an alcoholic and screwing whores, then gets her killed, nice plan there who the f is the bad guy? Almost looks like he planned this, so nobody would find out he screwed a prostitute. They go to some remote place instead of some military base, lets go to some place where the bad guys can just blow up the entire house and have a nice bbq after that. Why use Q gadgets if you can make bombs out of plastic bags and light bulbs. Who needs a Billion dollar budget for intelligence just use haunting rifles and improvised booby-traps.They at least could film someone walking with a flashlight in the distance but they obvious said to some one: 'You, go there and just go nuts with the flashlight so it is clear to the viewer. And why would you walk there with a flashlight? You could put a giant glowing sign on your head, with: 'we are here, please shoot us'.At the end he is crying like a little baby about a woman who gave an order that almost killed him. James Bond died there not M, M is just a replaceable character.Next time just call it 'MI6 the movie' and don't use James Bond.",2,150,284,3 November 2012
The Dark Knight," Overrated...
","Okey I went to the cinema for this movie with the idea it was higher rated then the godfather and pulp fiction... Well i just registered to IMDb to say I was very disappointed about this movie. Just because the flaws in the movie some. Here are some really stupid things in the movie: 1. Batman can bend a gun barrel whit his bare hands. 2. Dogs can chew true batman Armour but bullets can't. 3. The Joker can do everything: 3.1 He drives a school-bus into a bank and drive away without being noticed by anyone. And the bus had no scratch on it. 3.2 He can get into everything even on a parade with 100 of cops and the cops just ignore him there not even thinking about where there college's are. (But cops don't think in this movie they just panic when 1 guy takes a shot at the mayor) 3.3 The hospital that is guarded by lot of cops, Joker just walked in, the explosives are just there and he just walked out and blows the whole place up. He gets on a school bus and vanished into fin air. 3.4 He has tons of explosives on ferries that are heavily overcrowded. 3.5 They lock him up with a personal guard but they also lock him up in a general jail. Did he wanted room-service on his jail or was the personal guard to prevent him from getting bored? (but again cops are stupid in this movie)I had a lot of moment in the movie with:'Just shoot the Joker!!!!!'. Gotham was not Gotham but some city in the USA. Batcave was some to big ugly place under the ground with to many lights. third degree burn wounds just put a blanked on it wait some days and its all good but ugly. And god he was in pain I really noticed that... Balistic testing with some big ass gun why do you need a machine gun to fire 1 shot at a time for testing. This movie is just bad.But there some good things one is the joker was good he missed some good Joker jokes but at least is was evil. And really that the best thing I have to say about the movie. I give it a 1 against all those who gave it a 10... normally I would give it a 6/10",1,26,59,27 July 2008
