Airlift," Not so high on patriotism but not so less on entertainment.
","Airlift (2016) directed by Raja Krishna Menon starring Akshay Kumar and Nimarat Kaur in the lead is the story of when iraq invades kuwait and how 1,70,000 Indians were rescued in a most heroic way and that was the biggest evacuation in the history of the world.The best thing about this movie I liked is that it doesn't take time to built the story and the detailing of the character because there is no need of it if you are presenting a film which base on true events. You need to be more cautious about the facts and events happened during that time because some of the audience may have already done some research about the event. This film may not be so high on patriotism but it is surely an entertaining ride.Akshay Kumar in the role of Ranjit Katiyal was the best choice and I don't think that any other actor can pull up such a charisma rather than him. He was brilliant in his act and his hard work shows while he act. Nimrat Kaur in the role of Mrs Katiyal was average, I was missing the spark in her, Rest from all the supporting cast I liked Kumud Mishra the most. The direction from Raja krishna Menon was good but it could have been brilliant.At last I can only say that Airlift is a strong attempt to bring out the most historical evacuation of India in a form of entertainment.7/10 or 3/5",7,1,12,22 January 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Most lamest way of storytelling. Highly Disappointed.
","Batman vs Superman : Dawn of justice created an exceptional hype from last one year by releasing teasers, trailers, trolls on social media, doing marketing etc.I also had huge expectation with this one because I was never a fan of Superman movies (Never seen any) but a die hard fan for Batman. So before going to the movie I have done my homework by seeing Man of Steel which is directed by Zack Snyder to understand the character of Clark Kent and also the way of storytelling by the director. Man of Steel was just a normal superhero movie with no extra ordinary effort in storytelling and only with good CGI & VFX.So BVS is the most disappointing movie of 2016. There was not a single moment of excitement in the entire 2 hours 31 minutes long movie. The cinematography was so dull and dark that I had to check my 3d glasses over and over again. The are many questions emerged in my mind after watching the movie that why batman wants to kill superman, why superman was following him in a mid car chase & warns him and why batman was getting weird dreams about waking up in a mid of desert.Ben Affleck performance as Bruce Wayne was good but he sucks as Batman specially that metal bat suit. Henry Cavill role as Clark Kent didn't excites me well instead I liked Gal Gadot small but powerful role as Wonder Woman.Overall I don't understand why they have made movie like this and why there was so much fuss and hype for.1.5/5",3,0,7,26 March 2016
Spectre," It's an high time to change the face of Bond.
","Spectre (2015) Directed by Sam Mendes starring Danial Craig and Christoph Waltz in the lead supported by Léa Seydoux and Monica Bellucci.Whenever there is a new Bond movie, we expect stunning visuals, brilliant action scenes, breathtaking chasing sequences, cool gadgets and the most important better story. We always had high expectation from each and every bond movie.Few months back I had watched American Beauty (1999) for the first time and I just fell in love with the direction of Sam Mendes (of course Kevin Spacey too) and was hoping to see that magic again.Moving to spectre, the movie fails to create that charm again after Skyfall. So I am totally disappointed with the latest flick. It has some stunning visuals with brilliant cinematography. It also has 1-2 chase sequences which is good but when I talk about the overall experience it's an average flick. The movie is certainly over hyped. Daniel Craig as always is good as Bond but we need a new face of a bond now. Christoph Waltz role is the biggest disappointment, it's not his fault but the script was not demanding. Bond girl (Léa Seydoux) had nothing much to do in the film. After the first hour the films becomes boring. Go with less expectation, maybe you can enjoy more.",6,1,6,7 November 2015
