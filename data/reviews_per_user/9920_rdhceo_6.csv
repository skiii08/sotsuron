Blade Runner 2049," A Failure of EPIC proportions. A sequel SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES.
","Had very high hopes for this film - since I enjoyed the original so very much. Right off the top - making the lead character a replicant? WORST mistake they could of made. Casting Ryan Gosling as the lead - pretty much destroyed this film - he was in a word - Maybe Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't available - which would have made this mistake even worse. Not even my favorite character - Mr. Harrison Ford could save this flusher. The lead character's name is K? Really?!?!?!? Never saw Men in Black? aWhat happened to the music? Two hours and forty four minutes of my life that I can never get back.The only positive note I will add here. I'm going to assume that the people who produced, wrote, directed, scored and cast this film neglected to watch the original. This also goes for those who left all the positive reviews here.",1,2,6,26 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," In One Word - FLACCID. Tried to give Once Upon a Time an honest chance, it failed.
","For me this film has 2 strikes on it before it ever leaves the hamper; Tarantino directed/wrote it & DeCrappyowe starred in it. Never got the over exaggerated hype regarding Pulp Friction either. Be willing to bet you that if you visit Tarantino's home - the first thing you will see is every award he has ever received. The role Pitt played did not improve this mess either; perhaps the Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses from the 99 cent store were supplied to impress someone? Never going to happen. Even an appearance from Pacino couldn't save this expired tripe. The story line in this movie is non-existent; it starts somewhere and leads nowhere, yet another common Tarantino trait. If a young child in a film has to speak up to tell you 'that was the best acting I've ever seen' - you're already sagging pretty damn low. If you have the limited mental capacity of an 8 year old child - you might enjoy this film - I was NOT impressed, not by any of it. Grew up in the 60's - never found anything amusing about the activities of the Manson family - it was not something that people enjoyed or desired to dwell upon further. Yet another film that I would never visit the cinema to watch - not even close to being worth the investment in time or money. Read one review that actually compared Tarantino to Woody Allen - sorry, but they may as well have come from 2 different planets. Might as well pitch this film into the same fetid heap as the Joker. Wondering why this mess has such a high average rating - as most of the reviews are not very positive.",1,7,11,2 February 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Worst Spider Man Film Yet - no spoilers here
",Have been a comic book and comic book film fan for a very long time. This film seems geared toward 10 year old viewers - maybe that's where the good reviews here are from. The decision to put Mr. Garfield into the lead role was in a word WEAK. A film with this much resources and following with an unknown actor as the lead - who ever made that decision should be terminated immediately. Jamie Fox's part - due to the script/acting ability or both - was ludicrous. I shut this film off after 15 minutes of viewing. One of the top 10 worst films I've seen in years. As per my earlier comment - even when I was 10 - I would have walked out of the theater in this case. Something must have happened at the executive studio levels to completely ruin a film with this much capital and resources behind it. Getting rid of Tobey Maguire was a fatal error.,1,3,29,22 August 2014
Joker," STANDALONE DC VILLAIN FILM? NOT FOR ME.
","Over rated by many. Interesting attempt, I enjoy the DC films for many reasons - most of which are not included in this script. What are included are too many reality based scenarios - which I watch the DC films to Forget about. Overall, I'd say that a standalone film about a DC villain - doesn't fly.",3,7,17,20 December 2019
Blade Runner," One of the top Sci Fi films of all time.
","After watching the sequel to this film - went back to watch the original again just to wash the bad taste off of my palate. Denis Villeneuve directed the sequel as well as 'The Arrival' - which is somehow even worse than the Blade Runner sequel - it was insulting to watch. Willing to bet that many of the people who left the poor reviews for the original Blade Runner - went on to watch the sequel and say it was great. Casting Gosling to lead that film pretty much destroyed it right out of the box. The only thing that could of been worse would of been to put DiCaprio in the lead - which makes me even more nauseous. If they make another sequel - I wouldn't watch it if it was the last new movie to ever be made.Anyone who requires needs an explanation as to why this film is superior.- is beyond help. This film is not Star Wars, Avengers or Alien. It is NOT a story regarding flying about in space ships and chasing aliens and interacting with comical robots. This story is about relationships and was very well crafted.The technical aspects of this film, the music, photography, story line, acting, etc. make it a science fiction classic that will never be reproduced.",10,1,2,26 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I Enjoyed this film thoroughly (might be a spoiler or 2)
",Not sure if I watched the same movie as MANY of these reviewers did. Could be possible that they did not grow up with the Star Wars films as I did - and do not have the same admiration and appreciation for the film as a series or group. Just wondering what exactly do some of these people want? Do those who give this such bad reviews want this to be identical to 'Mr. Holmes' or 'The Theory of Everything' - which are good films - but they are not in the Star Wars genre. Maybe they've seen too many X-Men movies? It's possible that these same people prefer to watch 'Hunger Games' or the 'Twilight' movies - and frankly they can have the cinema all to themselves for those series. Sort of surprised that Lucas did not direct the film - but I understand he has become older and is maybe not up to the task. Did enjoy the role Daisy Ridley played. John Boyega I could leave or take - he was only acceptable in his level of acting ability when compared to past actors in this group. There were some glitches in the film - but overall I was extremely pleased by this film. My only semi complaint was the lack of Yoda - which I am sure will be changed in the upcoming films...,10,3,26,20 March 2016
