Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," stupidity without reason
","Coming to this movie I was prepared for stupid humor but in reality the movie is just plain stupid. Sasha Coen plays a guy from Kazakhstan but he doesn't even speak their language. Neither the village nor people themselves look like Kazakh. His behavior implies that Kazakh people are in 19th century or something which is totally untrue. Kazakstan is quite a big country with big cities, and of course people know about the current technology and etc. His behavior just doesn't make any sense; only people from an island far far away could behave like that... Also I don't understand why the movie is so antisemitic especially that Sasha is of Jewish descent himself. I've never heard that Kazakh people are antisemitic. So, now I can't really comprehend what was the purpose of the movie. Maybe somebody has a grasp?",1,13,25,13 November 2006
