Sucker Punch," Gripping and wonderful, it just doesn't get any better than this!
","This is one of he best movies, I've ever seen. It's real, and unreal at the same time, it's gripping and emotionally engaging. It's also full, of eye candy, but that only adds to the feel of some parts being unreal, and because of that they are also beautiful, while the reality is cruel and unforgiving. The cast was chosen excellently, the music and sounds were beyond perfect. Well, I guess, I am not a really good critic, but if a movie makes me register to a site, just to worship it; than that movie has accomplished something thousands of others couldn't. I strongly advise anyone to go on and watch this movie, it's a masterpiece. P.S.: If you got scared of how too artistic, or too cruel this movie is at the very beginning, than give it an other try, you wont regret it..",10,9,17,19 June 2014
