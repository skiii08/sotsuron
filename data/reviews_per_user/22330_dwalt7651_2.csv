Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Of all the Intricate Holmes Plots...
","I've kept this on my quasi-monthly list to watch. The intrigue between Moriarity and Holmes, through deceit, chess, or chemistry.
Tribute to Basil Rathbone...this works wonderfully in this day and age.",10,2,4,14 February 2018
Alien: Covenant," An Awful Predictable Kiddie Flick
","Possible Spoiler Included:You should be so lucky to have spoilers here instead of the 'spoiled' feeling you'll have when you're done with this drawn-out monstrosity.Just terrible. Completely predictable twists. There is no real story of the Engineers nor the origin of the Aliens. It's a insult to the original book that had the grip and originality that gave me nightmares back in the day. The crew neither knows nor performs protocols. When confronted with to identical beings, no one has a method of discerning the two? ...especially when one is sociopathic. No quarantine procedures? Totally amateur plot. This is a sore disappointment for Ridley (Scott) to have put anything like this to the screen.",1,23,45,27 May 2017
