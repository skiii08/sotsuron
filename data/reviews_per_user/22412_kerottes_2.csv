Requiem for a Dream," Scary!
","After seeing this movie i wanted to throw away my cigarettes, stop drinking alcohol and the slim chance of me ever trying drugs flew out the window! It scared the hell out of me!Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connely are all great in this movie. Their interpretations of drug addiction were excellent! Ellen Burstyn, however, as Leto's mother Sara, was absolutely brilliant in her part! As much as heroin and hard drugs scare me, this frantic woman on amphetamin diet pills was worse than any hard junkie alive!This woman's tragic fate should be a wake-up call for sleezy gameshow, TV assh***s who exploit this kind of people every chance they get! Seeing this poor woman throw her self into drug abuse to fit into an old dress because she's going to be on TV is heartbreaking!It starts off kind of funny. With the old woman walking about, happy as hell, she's high and shes going to be a celebrity. As the movie goes on the situation moves out of the sphere of fun and continues towards the path of tragedy. And when the Fridge sends her out on the streets you know there's no hope left!Leto's arm, all infected from the heavy drug abuse and dirty needles is probably the most discusting thing i've ever seen in a movie. You can practically smell that sh*t right through the screen.When Marion comes home after 'performing' for the horny old men, removing what respect she had left for herself, she lies down on the coach with a bag of heroin, smiling. She loves her drugs that much.All these things combined with the excellent work of the director make this movie a classic, not easily forgotten!",Null,0,1,17 April 2002
The Matrix," Great movie!!
","The Matrix provides a great thrill for whoever watches it, but it is also a wake up call to all the arrogant human beings in the world. The inevitable creation of AI is going to be the ruin of us all, and after all, why not? Isn't time to take another step in evolution? To push human kind down the food chain? The Matrix gives a worst case scenario of the future and gives us a message as well as entertaining the hell out of us all!!",9,0,1,2 April 2002
