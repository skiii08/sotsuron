Iron Man 3," Different, but it worked.
","Before watching this movie, I had heard that it was the worst one out of all of them. However, I liked it. It was always going to be different with Shane Black coming in for Jon Favreau but I thought it worked quite well. I thought the balance between the ingenious wit and at times seriousness of Tony Stark was spot on. Although some may disagree, I loved what they did with the Mandarin. It's something different, something that you don't expect. That sums up Iron Man in general. You don't see many films doing that sort of thing. Completely tearing up the comic lore and going with something completely different. I liked it and I respect them for doing that. OK, there were areas where I thought could've been better. I expected Pepper to have a more prominent role in the film as I thought that would've worked well, following on from the Avengers. It would've also been nice to see Aldrich Killian's background been explored more as this would've added to what is already a great film. It was never going to be a 'one of the best of all time' films but I really enjoyed it and felt that although it was different, it kind of worked.",7,0,1,30 July 2013
Django Unchained," Superb
","Django Unchained. This is one movie you have to see. Sure, it's a long film but that just makes it even better. It just has Quentin Tarantino written all over it. A fairly simple and straight-forward plot is brought to life with brilliant acting from Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz and some over-the-top violence thrown in there too. The soundtrack, also, as with every Tarantino film, is brilliant as well. That's part of it. Part of why it's so good. Tarantino. This film with another director is just a standard, ordinary movie. But with Tarantino, as always, it's special and it is truly superb. Definitely one of the best films I have ever seen.",9,0,2,30 July 2013
Despicable Me," Disappointing
","I watched the movie because of the huge hype about the sequel, Despicable Me 2. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about as this appeared nothing more than a little animated film that would never be heard of again two months after release. So it must be a good film, right? No. It was very dull with a shallow and predictable story. Also, I thought animated films were supposed to be funny. I found myself being forced to laugh at times despite this being (apparently) 'a funny film'. There were a couple of genuine smiles but I can count on one hand the amount of times I nearly laughed. This is just like most animated films, it has a silly story, poor voice acting (at times I thought Steve Carell sounded like Shrek) and just generally average. I don't know why it's so popular. Actually, I have a theory... Them Minions! Everyone loves them because they are cute and funny. No they're not. They're annoying and stupid. It's so blatant that they are an advertising tool to cover up for this poor movie. They are the thing that little kids remember from this movie and that's why it's so popular. It wouldn't surprise me if they had their own movie soon! To sum up then, Despicable Me is just another animated film. The reason people like it might be because of the Minions but I can find no other reason at all.",3,5,11,29 July 2013
