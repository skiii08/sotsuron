It," Best Remake Ever!!
","I was actually suprised by this movie. Unlike the Tim Curry one, this one had better acting. I didnt expect that they would show Georgie's death ONSCREEN! And then theres Pennywise. I can tell he is more scarier and bigger than Tim Curry.",10,1,1,8 October 2018
Avengers: Endgame," This was better than Infinity War
","BEFORE YOU READ- SPOILERS BELOW
Ok. So it starts out with Hawkeye's family getting dusted (and he doesn't even notice it). Then it shows Tony and Nebula stuck on the guardians ship. Tony is about to die of hunger, thirst, oxygen. Until Captain Marvel shows up and brings her to the Avengers HQ. They talk about what happened when they were fighting Thanos, making fun of Rocket because he's a raccoon. Then they all go to where Thanos is at. (It's literally some random planet). Then they find Thanos, and he tells the Avengers that he used all six stones to get rid of the stones. Then Thor literally DECAPATATES THANOS!! So then we get a time jump of five years. Tony has a daughter, Ant-Man gets out of the quantum realm, and Thor is fat and drunk as heck. Turns out, Korg, Meek, and Valkyrie survived. Ant-Man mentions to Steve that he can use the quantum realm to time travel. No one believes it at first, but Tony finds a way too. So then Black Widow goes to Japan to track down Hawkeye. He volunteers to be one of the first people to time travel in this movie. So then everyone goes back in time to get all six stones (at different times). We see the ending of Avengers 1, Tony bumps into his father in the 70's and 2014 Thanos finds out about the time travel stuff (because of Nebula's memory files) They do eventually get all the stones and snap their fingers to make half the universe come back. It happens, but 2014 Thanos attacks the Avengers. Then Captain America picks up Thor's hammer, Doctor Strange calls every dead character to fight Thanos (and his army). Tony snaps his fingers and he wipes out Thanos and his army. He eventually dies from the overpower of the stones. (There's actually something I forgot, Black Widow gives herself up in order to get the soul stone). So then we see Tony's funeral. Literally everyone is there. Captain America goes back in time to put the stones where they originally belonged, but he does that and he stayed in the past. We see him really really old. He just wanted to be with Peggy. The End. There is no post/end credits scene.",10,2,4,28 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Marvel Did It.
","Infinity War. It felt like we have been waiting for it for years (or even since it was first announced). Josh Brolin does a fantastic job voicing Thanos. The Avengers team up with the Guardians Of The Galaxy to prevent him from getting the Infinity Stones. The movie had its funny moments. Not as funny as Thor: Ragnarok's jokes, but still can be found funny. WARNING SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!
---------------
So. About the funny line: Drax makes up this joke and here how it goes: Tony, Parker, and Strange meet the GOTG, Quill says 'where is gamora?' then Tony says 'ill do you one better WHO is gamora?' then drax says 'WHY IS GAMORA!!' And about the whole preventing thanos from getting all 6 infinity stones, you would probably think: 'its marvel. the heroes always win'. But you guessed wrong because thanos ACTUALLY gets all 6 stones and he snaps his fingers. Causing half the universe to die. Here are the people who are known to die:Bucky, Black Panther, Falcon, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, Nick Fury, Maria Hill. Those are the people who die from the snap. Now finally, here are the people who DONT die from the snap: Heidmall, Loki, Vision, and Gamora. THE END",10,1,2,13 October 2018
Joker," The Darkest any superhero movie would go..
","Ok, first of all, I'm not spoiling this movie. Joker is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix is a good joker. I'd say Heath Ledger and him are even. Definitely not a kids movie.",10,0,3,15 October 2019
Jaws," best. summer. movie. ever.
","Jaws, a classic, 70s shark movie that made people not go to the beach. As it was 'terrifing' it bought potential into kids and adults for meaning this movie is for ALL ages!!",10,0,2,6 May 2018
Halloween," John Carpenter's Masterpiece
","Halloween (1978) is a classic horror slasher movie that John Carpenter created. The main antagonist, Michael Myers, wears a Captain Kirk mask painted white and darkened hair. He mainly is seen stalking the protagonist, Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Here is the full quick recap of the movie:
The Movie starts out with Micheal Myers as a young boy murdering his older sister (Judith Myers). Then he is sent to a mental asylum called Smiths Grove. About 15 years later, he breaks out of the asylum (which happens to be on Halloween). His psychiatrist, Sam Loomis is determined to look for Micheal. Then we are introduced to Laurie Strode. She is in high school and is happening to babysit this kid named Tommy Doyle. Her friends, Annie, Linda, and Nancy, are walking home from school and Laurie sees Michael. He walks behind a bush, and when her friend goes to look, he's gone. Micheal tends to stalk Laurie a lot through this movie, and every time he disapears. So let's fast forward to Halloween night, for the hell of it. Laurie is Babysitting Tommy, and her friend is babysitting this girl named Lindsey. Her friend drops off Lindsey at Laurie's, and she goes to meet her boyfriend. She doesn't because when she gets in her car, Micheal appears in the car and strangles and sliced her throat. Her OTHER friend is seen with HER boyfriend, and Micheal happens to come across them both, and he kills them both. Laurie happens to find their bodies, and she freaks the frick out. Micheal finds Laurie and starts chasing her. She manages to get a few hits on Micheal, on his eye and chest. Micheal is somehow immune to pain throughout these movies. Loomis shows up and shoots the living  outta Micheal and he falls off the house balcony. The ending of this movie is when Loomis looks down the balcony Micheal fell off, and to find out: HE'S GONE. THE END.",10,0,0,21 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the best movies ever made
",Everybody knows Star Wars. With the lightsabers and the 'force'. Its a great movie. WATCH IT,10,0,0,16 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Better Than Ep 4
","Empire Strikes Back is ALSO one of the greatest movies of all time. The most famous scene is where Darth Vader says 'i am your father'. Also, Han Solo gets frozen in carbonite (he is alive!) so definitly a Sci-Fi, Action, and Romance movie.",10,1,2,12 October 2018
