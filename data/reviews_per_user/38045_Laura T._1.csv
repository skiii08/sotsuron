Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Was it worth the wait? Not sure!
","Well, I did it...I actually found myself waiting in line mid-day Tuesday to catch the 12:01am showing of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  Someone asked me, 'Was it worth the wait in line?'  Guess what! I'm still not sure!Here's the thing, I don't go for fluff in movies.  This movie reeked of fluff in the name of one single character, Jar Jar Binks.  It seems to me George Lucas was aiming towards a 5-10 year old audience with him.  This is fine if you like cheesy puns...but lets get serious, some die hard fans may dislike this marketing ploy.On the more positive side, the actors were outstanding.  Especially Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine. Another major bonus was the fight choreography during the jedi duel featuring Ray Park as Darth Maul.  This is a scene that should become a fan favorite.Lastly, to the movie's credit was the story line.  Overall the plot was easy to follow and kept my attention.  Even after overcoming a *long* first hour and the even longer pod race.  Some viewers might find the ending somewhat weak and oddly reminiscent of A New Hope.After writing my thoughts on The Phantom Menace, I should answer my friends question, was it worth the wait in line?  Initially, my answer is yes.  As a long time fan of the Trilogy, I felt it was my duty to be there for the first showing,  though it certainly was not the best of the series.  Kids will love it.  Adults, maybe.  I'll have to give it a 3 1/2 stars out of five, if that counts for anything.  Go see it once the lines shorten, you'll be glad you waited.",8,0,1,20 May 1999
