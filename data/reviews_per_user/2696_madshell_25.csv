Raiders of the Lost Ark," Simply a classic
","Easy review here:  Harrison Ford wows the world as Dr. Henry 'Indiana' Jones, goes after the Ark of the Covenant (the most awesome prop in film history); and with a little help from a great supporting cast, a brilliant special effects producer, and the most celebrated director of our modern era, he makes the careers of several people skyrocket.  Let me remind you this ACTION MOVIE was nominated for Best Picture by the Academy, and it darn well deserved it's nomination!  (How often does that happen?)But hey, you know this already by now!  It's ancient history, right?",10,0,0,22 August 2000
Casablanca," Was it just that Ingrid Bergman Looked Beautiful?
","Is this film THAT good?  API named it #2.  Can someone tell me what makes this film the second greatest movie in film history? Yes -- I've seen it...TWICE.  I thought it was dramatically lacking in the screenplay -- the characters walk in and out and never truly involve each other.  You never get the truth about what these characters really want from each other, nor is there any clear central point to the story.It seems to me what people like about this film most is the glamour of Ingrid Bergman -- and the low key cool act of Humphrey Bogart.  It's all style -- no substance.",4,18,50,13 January 1999
Fight Club," Keep your soap to yourself
","After viewing this film, I begin to wonder if the filmmakers want us to believe that every man wants to ultimately rebel and then flog themselves to near death for doing so.   Evidently, they have that vision of despair; that lack of faith in humanity.Perhaps some call it artistic expression, but pure cynical humour, to me, is self-indulgent garbage.   All it does is propagate more confusion in a blatant refusal to understand.Where Se7en had brilliance -- in the display of the seven deadly sins, the clarity of each character, the horror of the consequence of action -- Fight Club almost displays the horror of human life itself, and that's just plain bad art.Yes, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are wonderful in it.  But why are they in it? If the filmmakers are so unhappy with themselves and humanity, they should at least give us a vision of how they feel things SHOULD be!  Or let someone else get greenlighted that can at least appreciate something about humanity. Sell your soap somewhere else.  I ain't buying it!",5,1,4,15 October 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Lost in the Woods?
","Even in its thrills and direction by maturing (yet still somewhat the same) Tim Burton, somehow this film does define both 'sleepy' and 'hollow.' Perhaps it is in the fact that it really isn't spooky enough.  (Good thing for me -- I hate scary movies!)It suffers from being way too forgetable, and from all the hard work involved, that's a legendary shame.",8,0,0,15 October 2000
Alien," Scott and Giger recreate Sci-fi Horror
","Ridley Scott's frenetic camera work combined with the nightmarish, yet genius biomechanoid visions of H. R. Giger brought us the most hideous, disgusting creatures that ever might be out there in deep space.   The theme of the movie is often imitated, but never executed as well -- even in its own sequels.With lurking not uncommon to the mythical realms of Howard Phillips Lovecraft, the creature is out there in the shadows, camouflaged by the technical scenery.  Sleek and slowly it creeps, yet jumps quick to the attack, jaws slashing, screaming.  More than scary, this film taps into the fears of the unknown and leaves us there unguarded.",10,0,1,15 October 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One movie to rule them all?
","When one takes a look back in movie history, the fantasy genre seems to be a few-and-far-between item, primarily because of the B-Movie stereotype to which they adhere.  I can remember walking out of George Lucas's 'Willow' and thinking it was a good fantasy film.After seeing 'The Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring' I can without a doubt say that this film is the ultimate definitive fantasy film. Not only that though:  From its talented cast of actors, to the inspired dialogue, and the jaw-dropping visual effects, Middle Earth, the grandfather of the fantasy genre, resides on celluloid with the dignity and scope only author Tolkien himself achieved with words.Being a fan of the books and having read 'Fellowship...' numerous times, as well as seeing other less adequate adaptations, Peter Jackson's adaptation is the closest, most comprehensive labour that could ever be filmed of the first book in the Ring epic.Since 'The Two Towers' and 'Return of the King' were filmed with 'Fellowship...' simultaneously, they must be incredible as well.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
Lilo & Stitch," Oddly brilliant
","In a very strange twist, the story is 'Dumbo' and 'The Ugly Duckling,' and a bit of 'E.T.'  It's also just as pleasing as all those stories as well.Lilo, a young native Hawaiian girl, who has been orphaned to all but her older sister, prays for an angel to come and to be her friend.  At the same time, an alien mutant escapes from being locked up for his destructive tendencies.  When the alien lands on Earth, Lilo mistakes him as a dog and adopts him, naming him Stitch.  While her older sister struggles to get employed, Lilo tries to get Stitch to become a model citizen using Elvis as the model of a fine citizen.  But Stitch can't help but be himself, which means wreaking havoc on most everything!Chris Sanders, animator and director of 'Mulan' as well as the creator and voice of 'Stitch' directs this movie to Disney Classic stardom.  Sanders knows where to make it funny and where to make it touching, never skipping a beat.",9,3,4,22 August 2004
The Patriot," Braveheart in America -- NOT!
","Let's get something straight.  When someone makes a movie similar to another movie with the same type of plot and the same actor, there are bound to be comparisons between the films.'The Patriot' almost too well puts Mel back into 'Braveheart''s freedom fighter, William Wallace -- except sending the hero forward into time to the American Revolution.  Yet, the film bares a similar theme:  normal, everyday man gets his life ripped apart by tyranny of war -- and has to fight.  No problem, though.  What bothers me about 'The Patriot' is that director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, Stargate) seems jarred by Robert Rodat's (Saving Private Ryan) script; or is it the other way around?  Many scenes either seem paced, or seem cut to raw bone plot.   Characterization is largely disregarded -- save for its heavy concentration on Mel's character, 'Benjamin Martin.' 
Furthermore, the English seem to be cast as 'the bad guys,' which, to me, seems passe.   Enemies they are, but they aren't inhuman entities!   We are never given a clear reason why our infamous Bad Guy Brit, Col. Tavington is clearly psychotic, going beyond being a millitary opportunist, even endangering his own career infront of General Cornwallis for the thrill of being brutal.Thrown into the script are random scenes of emotionally manipulative drivel, which are totally unnecessary, blurring the focus of the film.  
I would like to say it would have been better if Mel had more to do with the technical side of the film, but I cannot even give the film that honor. Mel's directing in Braveheart was much more inspired, but Braveheart's script was, as well, brilliant.  The Patriot, which seeks Braveheart's glory, doesn't even come close to it.",5,0,1,14 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," us using us
","Although brilliantly funny and wonderfully acted by the title character (actor/character -- we have no clue if he actually is himself anymore), this film deceives in being bitingly cynical.  Are we, honestly, so obsessed with not being ourselves that we could stoop to stealing the identities of others -- FOR REAL?  Maybe so, but should film be about dictating what life IS or what life could be?I honestly have no pity nor sympathy for any of the characters in this film, perhaps not even Malkovich himself as he falls for the manipulative witch played by Keener.  It is a puppet show of dark humour, and we the unsuspecting children are engaged to watch it.The ending truly is the final straw, being absolutely disgusting. 
Let's face it, though.  It is popular to tell society that we are all perverted at heart, in some form or another.  Most of us already know this fact.  It's when we get past our repression and let ourselves be who we are that we might feel like we are truly worth our own lives, and therefore, in my opinion, worth celluloid.'...Malkovich' just wallows in its shadowy tunnel.",6,1,1,15 October 2000
Aliens," Ripley is back with reinforcements
","James Cameron's wildly successful sequel to the brilliant shocker, Alien, is not to be discarded as most movie sequels tend to be.  A very different film, Cameron gives us humans just a bit more of an advantage against the most loathsome creatures in the universe.  Send in those Marines!Ripley must go down to face her worst nightmares in order to rescue a surviving colonist, 'Newt' played by the adorable Carrie Henn.  Together, they face not just one -- but many of those horrifying demons of H. R. Giger's imagination, including the big bad mamma queen!Michael Biehn plays a good guy (whew! -- I hate his villains!),  and Bill Paxton blesses the screen (NOT!) with a quoteable 'Game Over, Man!...'But all jokes aside -- this film is pure entertainment!  Here, Ripley shows her feminine brawn, and Weaver plays it to the max with finesse.",9,1,2,15 October 2000
The Princess Bride," TRUUUUE LOVE...
","Pure genius!  Why do I say that?  Well... is this film making fun of the genre, or is it embracing it?  Both, it seems!Rob Reiner's instant classic film sweeps us away to the story of true love between a fair maiden and her lovingly loyal servant.   An abundance of humour, of thrills, and of 'inconcievables' follows.  Goldman's fantastic adapted screenplay (of his own book) gives us laughter, drama, and warms our hearts -- and those of generations to come.",10,1,2,22 August 2000
The Little Mermaid," The Disney Animated Renaissance Begins...
","With 'The Little Mermaid,' Walt Disney animation began a new renaissance comparable to Walt's beloved classics.  Disney's adaption of Hans Christian Anderson's tale introduces us to 'Little Shop of Horrors' musical composer Alan Menken, who begins his juggernaut victories every other year. Deservedly so!   Menken's co-collaborator, Howard Ashman, outs him in fine form.  The songs are simple, yet brilliant. As for Ariel's story, it's pure fun and frolic, with a bit of danger swimming on the side.   The film's pace never lets up.",9,0,0,30 August 2000
Mulholland Drive," She Wore Blue Velvet, Again
","Where, oh where is the identity of the amnesiac girl -- and does she really, really wish to know?   Betty helps her, being a perky, ever so saccharine cuddly bunny friend.  When the girls get too close, that's when Lynch's fires turn icy blue.Right smack in the vein he started with Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, Lynch gives us nightmares of the corrupt heart of Tinseltown; sans the Black Lodges and Lumbertowns, he makes Hollywood into his own twisted backyard.Don't veer away when you can't figure this one out.  It will make sense near the end of the picture.",9,1,1,29 April 2002
"Girl, Interrupted"," Angelina McMurphey?
","Yeah, I have to recall 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' for this one. Winona Ryder does her best acting that I have seen to date playing Susanna Kayson, a writer who learns compassion from a gaggle of misfits.  Ryder's voice over narration still sounds like 'Heathers,' but her overall performance is somewhat better. Clearly, the film belongs to Jolie, who is superb (when is she not?) as Lisa, the possible sociopath who has a bad habit of helping out her fellow committed neighbors.  Her Academy Award winning performance rocks the screen with a no BS attitude.  Jolie is like a fine-tuned soprano singing her best aria; the film utilizes her charisma, her sensuality, and her amazing emotional range.",8,0,0,30 August 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Journey
","What is the inner need of human beings to explore?  What is our connection to the unknown?  Has our technology helped, or hindered our search for answers; or has it furthered it?That is what I believe '2001: A Space Odyssey' asks.  The story -- though seemingly disjointed with Kubrick's signature vacuum-like directing -- makes us observers of the journey to understand what seemingly cannot be understood.  Within that journey, we can see the evolution of our species: where we have been, where we are, and where we will go.Thus, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a deep homage to our inner need to seek and understand what is unknown.  I find it to be fascinating in its vision.",10,1,3,14 July 2000
Singin' in the Rain," 'Gotta Dance' drags??
","I don't really understand the user comments saying that 'Gotta Dance' drags on!  That is outrageous!Not only was Gene Kelly one of the most captivating dancers, but he was an awe-striking choreographer and director as well!  The man knew dancing AND how to present dancing!!The sequence tells of the trials of the young dreamer in flawless beauty, like a soliloquy without words, but in motion and mood.  The colours in these scenes are like that of an oil painting, beautiful in their brilliance, style, and emotion.  Charisse and Kelly bring 'Singin'...' to a delight of mood and subtlety; possibly to never happen again on celluloid! 
Perhaps it is too much a forgotten art form in today's movies, but of its own genre, 'Gotta Dance' is a true work of absolute excellence!  Does that mean because it is 'too ballet' for audiences that it should be said to 'drag on?'  Open your minds a bit people!!Hollywood will most likely never make films like this again; why 'dis' them?",10,1,4,15 July 2000
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Illuminating the Soul
","Being neither a fan of Charlie Kaufman's work nor Jim Carrey's previous comic pratfalls, I met 'Eternal Sunshine...'  with the same reluctance of the main character meeting his soon-to-be, yet past girlfriend.  Incredibly charming, witty, and powerfully surreal, the film succeeds in explaining that elusive, strange phenomena; dare we call it 'fate?' 
I'd call nearly half of it 'Kate,' in her best performance since 'Titanic,' she is as real as a rain soaked birthday party.  What person wouldn't want to fight to not forget Winslet as Clementine?  She may have a cyclonic temper, but she's a sweet and vibrant personality.  She imprints herself on Carrey's Joel Barish so much that his own memory of her becomes a heroine to his invaded mind.As for Jim Carrey, his own range of emotion, from rage to confusion to utter joy and contentment, adds a deft subtlety to a movie about great extremes. Such an impressive performance makes me want to go to the doctor to erase any preconceived notion about him.Kaufman continues to point a frightened finger at those who take their lives like a grain of salt, easy to be thrown away or pulled like a bad tooth. Here, not as in '...Malkovich,' is a message 'eternally spotless:'  Our memories and fantasies are what makes us human.  No matter how painful they are, we should never throw them away.",9,0,1,22 August 2004
The Mummy Returns," Medium Popcorn, hold the scarabs, please.
","I said when I first heard about this movie:  'That's gonna be so stupid.' Maybe, it is somewhat of a dumb sequel.  I mean, let's face it.  There's no continuity, mythically, between the first film and second film.  How is Imotep's soul freed from the clutches  of almighty Ra in the first feature? And how is Anaksunamun resurrected without her 'true soul?'But, looky here, there's plenty of things happening to make you forget all that.  And it's loaded like a pistol with the same campy, fast-paced humour, shooting sharp.",8,0,0,5 February 2002
Titanic," A Modern Masterpiece
","In James Cameron's finest film to date, he writes and directs a period piece worthy of its name, and a solemn homage to those who passed on that fateful night in 1912. The labour of love's only due comparison is to Hollywood's yesteryear classics such as 'Gone With The Wind.'With a commentary on social classes and the trappings of the Victorians, Cameron goes beyond his norm -- and excells!!Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet charge the screen as Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukateer, respectfully.  A strong supporting cast including 'The Invisible Man's Gloria Stuart, who carries the film in flashback, brillantly.If you're one of the very few people who haven't seen it yet, be aware that you are missing one of Hollywood's finest films.  The combination of awestriking special effects and corsetted costume drama mix only too well.",10,2,3,22 August 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Gryffindor 150, Muggle Director 0
","After reading a bit of the book, and being totally enthralled with Rowling's witty and silly sense of humour, I can see why some who are fans of the book can think Colombus's celluloid interpretation is a bit diluted. Nevertheless, there is no fault in watering down the hijinx and hilarity of the three Gryffindor adventurers.  How many people would have stayed in the theater if the Hogwarts Sorting Hat had, as it did in the book, broken into a musical number?Forget the campy effects and the somewhat messy directing.  The movie belongs to the young actors, who deliver the cinematic snitch, and make Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger come alive with true magic.",8,0,0,21 December 2001
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Who's the one that's nuts?
","McMurphey has to be Jack's quintessential role.   A good hearted, yet unbreakable spirit who shows his fellow psychiatric ward occupants that they should not be treated like inmates.  Louise Fletcher's brilliantly cold performance as Nurse Ratched engages Nickelson's tragic hero head to head, lending us a memorable battle of determination.  Neither will budge in their iron wills. The result is a stunning film, both, emotionally engaging and socially disturbing.",10,1,2,30 August 2000
The Lion King," The Pridelands of Disney Feature Animation
","If Walt Disney himself had ever attempted an animated Hamlet, he wouldn't have gotten any better than The Lion King.   Disney Feature Animation richly crafts a morality tale that doesn't seem preachy, yet tells us of how we are all connected in a greater 'Circle of Life.'  A tour-de-force vocal cast includes the amazing voice of James Earl Jones, the ever so human voice of Matthew Broderick, the vicious, sarcastic and calculated voice of Jeremy Irons, and the humourous antics of Nathan Lane.  A fantastic collaboration of superstar songwriter Elton John and veteran lyricist Tim Rice produces some great Disney tunes.  With very likable heroes and villians, attention to mood and detail, and alive without missing a tribal beat of native Africa, The Lion King stands proudly and roars, loudly. 
Enjoyed by both adult and child, alike, it clearly defines what was once great in animation.  It is truly a masterpiece of filmmaking as well.",9,0,0,17 August 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Lord of All Fantasy Movies
","The final 3 hours of this impeccable saga do not let up from the action, the story, nor the message.   Here, Peter Jackson lovingly captures all of J. R. R. Tolkein's themes and brilliantly weaves them together for an apocalyptic finish to top of the two most brilliant fantasy features in cinematic history.  'Return of the King' is alive not only with the jaw-dropping effects of WETA workshops, but the superb acting skills of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Sean Aston, Elijah Wood, and Andy 'Gollum' Serkis.The begining of the film gives Serkis a well-deserved cameo after being behind the animation of Gollum.  In a flashback, Serkis is brilliant as the dumb, and greedy river dweller who murders his own brother for the power of the ring; greatly foreshadowing the events to occur in the Crack of Doom.Sean Aston takes the movie as Sam, who goes through all of fire and shadow, pain and passion to help his friend destroy the evil that has latched on to him.  Samwise is like a Judas without flaw; we see him agonize over his actions, even as he is not guilty of any cruelty toward Frodo, but a victim of Gollum's madness. John Noble's Denethor, vile Steward of Minas Tirith, and father to Boromir and Faramir, makes one's skin crawl with both disgust and anger.  Arrogant and full of judgement and accusations, he seems the most evil without even carrying a ring!  Also, watch Miranda Otto's portrayal of Lady Eowyn as she and Merry slay the Nazguul witch-king.   Her strength of character and sense of duty to her fallen king are breathtakingly played.  All Tolkein's storyline are brilliantly tied up.  We see our heroes and heroines return or re-begin their lives.Astonishingly beautiful filmmaking!",10,0,4,22 August 2004
Tarzan," One of Disney's Best
","Approved by Burrough's legacy, this film portrays the actual character the classic author penned.  Disney Studios's new technique of computer aided background layering known as 'Deep Canvas' allows our heroic 'Ape Man' to take us along through the trees in stunning three-dimensional action.Minnie Driver is priceless as the voice of Jane Porter, who is as lovable as laughable.  Other excellent voices are lent by Rosie O'Donnell, Brian Blessed, Nigel Hawthorne; and a marvelous vocal performance by Lance Henrikson as the dominating Kerchak, Tarzan's reluctant Gorilla father. I have to say, I was extremely surprised how much I loved and continue to love this film.  Tarzan is a thrill-a-minute, sensitive, and strong animated film.",10,2,2,30 August 2000
Gladiator," Glad I saw it...
","What good is one man to an empire like the Roman Empire.  Why should one man be important?  The Gladiator answers these questions fairly.  With beautiful scope masterfully done by veteran director Ridley Scott, Gladiator forces us into the broken life of Maximus, played very well by Russell Crowe.  A commander of the Roman Armies and a surrogate son to a dying Roman Emperor, Maximus just wants to return home.  He has seen too much of war.In his humility, he declines his dying Emperor's wishes for him to take the throne, and leaves the boon to the Emperor's spoiled rotten son, Commodus (of which Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour-de-force performance.)Because of his jealousy over his father's love, Commodus is sick with envy over Maximus's importance.  In his ignorance, he makes Maximus the main attraction of his new Collusium in Rome, where the warrior, now gladiator, must face death and thrill the crowds -- in turn, making him to be a legend beyond his own Imperial name.With fine acting, a wonderful screenplay and excitement galore, this movie captivates.",9,0,0,15 October 2000
