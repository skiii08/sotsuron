Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Darth Vader ...uncovered
","As all the kids who were born in the 70s and lived the 80s I grew up watching Star Wars. It becomes part of your life.. you collect the little models and play with your light saber, I think every kid who witnessed the 70s and the 80s did the same so star wars became a culture on its own. The original trilogy was never outdated, the special effects were fine for the 90s and I didn't feel I was watching a cheap flick or an old Sci-Fi that looked old and shabby.Anyhow as a Star Wars fan I was so excited about the release of Episode I , expecting something along the same lines, but the disappointment was great.It could be the biggest 3rd box office hit in the world, they say it had excellent effects.. I just didn't feel i liked it.  I thought it was fake, the characters were not well drawn, I didn't feel any affiliation with Qui-Gon, or young  Obi-Wan, nothing like how you feel towards Luke Sky Walker or Han Solo or even Darth vader whom everyone loves to hate.  And the Queen, I even hated her more than princess Liya. Jar Jar did not replace CP3O or Chwbaka. The Kid Anakin was ok but not waw.  That was the emotional bit ( thank you Lucas for chattering my childhood dream).Now we come to the technical part.  Yes all was great, the city, the animation the best money can buy, but then again all looked animated, inanimate, with no life.  Everything looked so unreal (toy story style). The best thing about the old 3 episodes was that everything looked so real, maybe if they had Jar Jar in a custom instead of animating him I would have like him better.   The lavish customs were nothing like Star Wars , it  was too much , but maybe this was to distract us from the weak plot  as the story was so shallow and predictable.Anyhow, I know for a fact that I am not really looking forward to episode II and III , I will stick to the original triology and watch Matrix II this summer.",Null,0,1,12 April 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," At last we got to know how our beloved Luke Skywalker and his annoying sister got conceived. Young Any and Amidala team up to create a psudo impossible sinful love story as the not very old Senator falls in
","After the Phantom Menace, I've decided to boycott any movie bearing the Star Wars brand except for sure the original trilogy which I still think of as the `original', for sentimental reasons, and I bet all the people who grew up with a Darth Vader lunch box and Luke Skywalker Pjs would understand how disappointing the phantom menace was.  After 3 weeks or so of the release of episode II I decided to disregard my prejudices and go see the new Lucas addition to the Star Wars Saga, especially after reading good reviews about it.  To be honest, it was better than the Phantom Menace but still no where near as good as any of the old stuff.  The Characters are well defined and deep, and although I liked young `Any' my liking can't change the fact that the boy can't act, besides the image of little 'Any' in diapers being protected by Amidala made me  think along the lines of a `sinful' amoral relationship bit of child molesting on the former queen's side..ugghh.  The movie was a bit slow till the last 20 minutes. Too much animation made the set look unreal, and Youda was much bigger when he was a man in the empire strikes back.. and more real too.  In addition I would like to add a bit of `borrowing' Like the beginning of the movie the city looked very `blade runner' `the 5th element' kind.  The warms to kill the Senator were borrowed from the `Dune' Mini series, in addition to some of the beautiful Arab looking palaces in Nabu that was `Dune' too.  The asteroids field was very much `farscapish' a bit on the side of warmhole technology.  Don't get me wrong Lucas is a great guy , he gave us the original trilogy and that is just mea hardcore Star Wars fan.",Null,0,0,10 June 2002
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Don't believe what they tell you. Go see it and judge for yourself. And there are Spoilers
","So I went to see the most awaited and anticipated movie since the making of cinema. Sorry star wars fans, I know you think this spot is for you , but there were many star wars movies, but no other feature film with the most 2 iconic superheroes of all time. Overall I liked it very much. Did I think it could be better? Yes, am I bitching about it? No. But I think there are some things that really irked me in the movie, but I tried not to make it a big deal so as to enjoy this momentous moment in nerd history. I divided my opinion into 3 categories as follows :Pros: -Don't believe those who say the story is jumbled and cluttered. It was very clear, except certain parts who non-comic fans wouldn't understand (Injustice maybe, some would totally not get it) . The story runs smoothly. <ul><li>Ben Affleck is the most Awesome Batman to date. He did a fantastic job depicting the A-hole hero. Yes I think Batman is a complete douche. I always did, but he did it so well I give him high props for that. Go Ben, and haters will be butthurt now. I wish he was portrayed as a less a-hole of a batman, but Frank Miller's version seemed to be the pop culture favorite that's because people are A-holes in general, so he talks to the douches in them. - Romance. OH MY GOD! Clark and Lois.please the B.S about them not building up the story in Man of Steel blab la bla.those 2 give me goose bumps every time they have a moment on screen. The looks they give each other, the love he has for her. Reminds me of the golden age when he was always there to save her. Please don't break them up, this is how you represent the most iconic relationship of all time. Amy and Henry have amazing chemistry. I just have to say wow. </li></ul><ul><li>Cinematography and action: Another wow, I loved every moment with exceptions, they will be in the cons. Just enough action to keep you interested without over saturating. - I have two words for you, seeing Jason Momoa as Aqua man gave me goosebumps. I can't wait. He is the king of the 7 seas, there is no other Aqua man that I can think of. Please forget about the blond comment and he doesn't look the role. He made it his own. </li></ul>Honorable mention: Henry Cavil is the best superman who ever graced the silver and the small screen. He just owns it. As a superman super fan, I have to say that every time he came on screen I feel flabbergasted by his presence. I still love the others, but no one can compete. Mehh: -Wonder woman was a total meh for me. I did not feel her. I wanted to get goosebumps but nah. She is just mehh. As a female I wanted to feel and take pride in the appearance of the most prominent female superhero of all time, but nope, speaking of that and not related at all but it seems there is a type going on, Electra on Netflix Daredevil who I think auditioned for the role and was a close runner up also gives me this Mehhh feeling, but in a more negative way. I really wanted to like her, but I think she lacks the charisma a character like that needed. -Doomsday was another mehhh for me. I wanted to be awed, but I was not at all, he looked more like a blob of skin and energy than doomsday. I thought he could be better, and I also thought how they made him was a bit off. Cons: -When the flash in the store looks like Cisco you know there is something wrong. There are no racial undertones here, I just don't get why get a guy who looks like Cisco to play the flash. It is confusing. Also I don't believe the BS Snyder said in the articles circulating on line. If it is about a multiverse, why can't Arrow use Harley, Dead shot and why can't we have Superman visit his cousin, and why can't Batman visit Starling city and why can't we have a flash point on the flash? So please spare me the multi verse BS and go talk to someone who would believe it. -Lex Luthor was like if the Joker and Harley spawned a child he would be this version of Luthor. I did not like him at all. He was not Luthory enough for me. And Lex Luthor was always one of my top 10 evil bastards of all time. <ul><li>OK I know I am a superman fan, and this will be taken against me. But pleasethe fight was just an ode to the Batman fans. At least give the man of steel some credit. He carried the freaking spear in the end and finished doomsday, but yet he was about to die under the heavily armored boots of batman. So no comment here. I just like things to make sense even in a fictitious world. But I would say maybe because it was his first encounter with Kryptonite * wink wink* </li></ul>I would give this movie a solid 4 stars. (out of 5) down with the critics and the haters.",10,0,1,28 March 2016
