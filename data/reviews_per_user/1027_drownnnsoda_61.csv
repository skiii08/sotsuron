The Blair Witch Project," Faux folklore; love it or hate it, it's still ingenious
","No other film made in my lifetime has stirred so much hullabaloo as 'The Blair Witch Project.' Granted, I was only ten years old when the film was released, but I remember its almost immediate absorption into the cultural lexicon; my fifth grade classmates told me stories about it, and how it was real, and how their teenage siblings had let them watch it with them when mom and dad went to bed. Thanks to an expansive marketing campaign that touted the film as 'real footage,' 'The Blair Witch Project' fascinated and tantalized audiences in 1999. Despite the fact that the film is entirely fabricated, and that everybody knows it, it doesn't change the fact that it captures an unusual realism that enables it to get under our skin in spite of all presupposition.The premise is simple: three college documentarians go into the woods to investigate the legend of a witch who has been said to be the source of various goings-on in a rural Maryland hamlet over the past century. What starts out as a hunky-dory camping trip slowly edges into a downward spiral of dread as the three find themselves helplessly lost and apparently hunted.As I mentioned, few films made in my lifetime have stirred up such a hullabaloo as 'Blair Witch,' and I think few films have also been so polarizing. While it is a true 'love it or hate it' film, and oh, are there haters, there still is no arguing that it's incredibly unique. Looking backwards over fifteen years later, the film has spawned an army of found-footage imitators that are still, for the most part, unimpressively smearing their way across cinema screens well into the twenty-first century. Few, if any, are even remotely as unsettling, and most of them are disastrous. The greatest thing about the film is that it dodges horror tropes in favor of character dynamic and vague suggestiveness. The filmmakers and actors portraying the characters ease potentialities into our heads from early on, interviewing locals about the folklore, relaying stories about purported murders and personal experiences that have been attributed to the witch; playing up the hype of the urban legend. What we don't realize as an audience, is that we very subtly become immersed in the allure and intrigue ourselves— and thus, by the time the characters find themselves at the mercy of nature and experiencing bumps-outside-the-tent-in-the-night, our psyches are impulsively running wild with the evocative power of the folklore that we have been provided. The possibilities of the nightmare here are endless, and that is the true power this film wields, even years later, and even when we know the truth. 9/10.",9,0,4,17 January 2015
Black Swan," Carmilla meets 'Repulsion'
","I had been anticipating this film for over a year now, and was ecstatic to find out it was coming to my city this past Friday; 'Black Swan' is frankly everything I'd hoped it would be, and genuinely lives up to its dazzling marketing campaign, critical accolades, and purported Oscar buzz. The film focuses on Nina (Natalie Portman), a twenty-something year old ballet dancer who has dedicated her life to the craft. She lives in a high-rise apartment in lower Manhattan with her overbearing mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina as well, and works for a ballet company run by a man named Tomas (Vincent Cassel). When a revival production of the infamous 'Swan Lake' is in the works, Tomas fires Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder), an aging dancer who had played the swan in several previous productions. In search of a new swan queen— one who can embody the white swan as well as the black swan— he eventually elects Nina, putting her life dreams into play. But things begin to get complicated when Lily (Mila Kunis), a dancer from San Francisco, comes to work for the company. She embodies the black swan in most every way- she is daring, vivacious, and unafraid of herself; whereas Nina embodies the white swan— graceful, innocent, and ultimately fated. This sparks wild insecurity and jealousy in Nina, who is already having problems letting herself go in her role as the black swan. As mounting pressure over the ballet gains momentum, Nina's grip on her role, as well as herself, begins to fall apart.Having been blown away by Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' years back, the content of 'Black Swan' piqued my interest from the get-go: crazy mothers, ballet, female competition, and insanity— what more could you want? Plot content aside, 'Black Swan' is captivating enough through its aesthetics, which truly are breathtaking. I have to clap my hands for the amount of work that went into this film, from the art department to the cinematographers, and to the actors and ballerinas. The production quality of this film is 'Swan Lake'-on-Broadway caliber. In terms of the plot, this is ultimately a character study; a portrait of a person who spirals downward in a climb toward perfection. Though this crux is formulaic and familiar (think Polanski's 'Repulsion'), the arena in which it takes place, as well as the circumstances of each of these characters is what makes the film stand on its own feet. Nina is the center of this movie, and her own frustrations, insecurities, and growing madness are lived and breathed by Natalie Portman. Her character ranges from timid to hysterical over the course of the film, and Portman executes each move with the precision of a professional ballerina. Her mother, played by Barbara Hershey, is key in all of the madness. She is forceful and caring toward her daughter, but the extent of their relationship is frankly disturbing. She tucks Nina into bed every night, helps dress her, calls her repeatedly, and domineers nearly every aspect of Nina's life. This may seem normal for a mother and a ten year old child— but not a daughter who is in her twenties. There's something definitely not right, and that uncomfortable dynamic between Hershey and Portman is illustrated wonderfully.Lily, played by Mila Kunis, is the catalyst in the story— a seductress and Carmilla-like figure, driving Nina's ambition as well as her insecurity through the roof, and Kunis does a great job here as well. She's lively and funny, but also sinister when necessary. Vincent Cassel owns the role of the rich, oversexed, and arrogant director, and Winona Ryder takes the rest of the cake here as the retiring self-destructive dancer; she only has a few scenes, but she's got a sort of drunken 1970s Joan Crawford sensibility about her, and also partakes in probably the most disturbing scene in the entire movie.The film builds itself into an astonishing third act, a crescendo for everything that has slowly burned through the course of the movie. It's astonishing not only visually, but also metaphorically, lyrically, and because of its hysteria- ridden balance between 'what is real?' and 'what isn't?', all of which combusts on opening show night.'Black Swan' leaves audiences with some questions but quite a few answers, and the ambiguous fragments really make the film what it is. The performances here by all the actors are fantastic, as is the art direction and the general storytelling itself. It may leave you scratching your head in regards to some of the material that is hinted at and thrown toward us without full explication; but ultimately it won't matter, because 'it was perfect'. 9/10.",9,2,7,12 December 2010
Changeling," Profoundly Disturbing Tale of Justice, Murder, and Corruption - 'Changeling' Lives Up To Its Hype.
","One of the big movie events of the year, Clint Eastwood's 'Changeling' has had a lot of buzz going about it up to its release, and I can tell you that all the chatter about this movie is well-deserved. Based on a true story, the movie focuses on single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a working-class woman living in 1928 Los Angeles with her son, Walter. After returning home one afternoon to find Walter has vanished, she seeks help in the Los Angeles Police Department to help find her son. Around five months later, a boy believed to be Walter is brought to L.A. from Illinois, and reunited with Christine - the only problem is, the child returned to her is not in fact Walter. What ensues is a bitter battle with the Los Angeles Police Department and the lead of the investigation, J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan). Aided by a reverend who knows of the LAPD's corrupt history (John Malkovich), Christine desperately searches for her son, but ends up disbelieved by those around her. Meanwhile, a deranged serial killer who may know something about Walter's disappearance is on the run...Plainly put, I simply loved every piece of this movie. Everything about it was stunning, from the music, to the acting, to the scenery - it was all so amazing. But besides the aesthetics of the film, what is the true point of interest here is the central mystery of the film - what happened to Walter Collins? We, the audience, are taken on an emotional, disturbing roller-coaster ride as Jolie does everything in her power to find her son, but is stomped on repeatedly by those around her (often males). There are layers and layers to the story here, but beneath the surface there is strong commentary on female submission during the era, the power of males in society, and the obvious corruption and greed that can be found within a system that is supposed to help the citizens. All of this comes across quite well, and the elements of the film coerce nicely.Angelina Jolie delivers an outstanding performance here, that I'm sure would make the real Christine Collins very happy. Her emotions, mannerisms, everything is so spot-on. She owns the role, and the audience can do nothing but sympathize with her character as the grieving, yet strong-willed mother. Supporting performances from academy award nominee John Malkovich and somewhat overlooked performer Jeffrey Donovan (who some horror fans might remember from the 'Blair Witch' sequel) are all deserved of praise as well. Another thing I'd like to mention is the capturing of the time - this is a period piece all around, and a very refined one at that. Everything is precise, and the costumes, set-design, and styles of the 1920s are extremely strong, if not completely flawless.The resolution to the events of the movie still leave questions, but give enough information as to what happened to Walter. The unraveling of everything that takes place about three- fifths through the movie is rapid and intense, with the unveiling of a disturbed ranch- handler who was responsible for the savage murders of twenty kids at his desolate farm, one of them maybe or maybe not being Walter. Apart from the missing-child aspect of the film (which makes it disturbing to begin with), the introduction of the serial-killer aspect is even more horrifying, accompanied by some awfully disturbing flashback sequences depicting the crimes. All the more horrible is that everything in the film is in fact true, and did happen. But at the end of the day, the movie does leave its audience with a glimmer of hope, and concludes itself on a somber but satisfying note as justice is served and some small sense of peace is delivered to Ms. Collins.Overall, 'Changeling' is an extraordinary movie-going experience. As far as period-pieces go, this is probably one of the very best I've ever seen, and the multi-layered plot never loses the viewer. I was completely engaged through all two and a half hours the film lasted, and was extremely happy with the movie when I left the theater. Beautiful cinematography and essentially flawless performances add to the positives here - I really can't complain about this movie at all. 'Changeling' is a tragic and disturbing tale of murder, corruption, empowerment - and above all, justice - that will haunt the audience for days after viewing. Highly recommended to anyone who likes a seriously good movie. 10/10.",10,7,11,12 November 2008
Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing, Haunting, Realistic - Amazing.
","'Requiem For A Dream' is honestly one of the most brutal, hard-hitting movies I've ever seen. It's a different kind of movie experience, and you won't finish watching it and think, 'Wow, that was great'. You'll think 'My God, that was devastating', and that's the real power in the film. The movie focuses on four people living in New York City - Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his television-obsessed mother, Sara (Ellen Burstyn), and his best friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). As each of them try and find solitude in their lives through drugs (everything from heroin, cocaine, to dieting pills), the hopes and dreams they once had began to become distorted as they focus all of their attention on feeding their addictions.Disturbing is the main term that could be used to describe this movie, because that's exactly what it is. Watching these people go through such hell is an awful thing, but it does send a clear message, displaying the possibilities of what can happen if you seek pleasure from an addicting substance. But this is no typical drug-addiction film, it's much, much different. Don't expect your typical 'teenagers addicted to drugs' fare. This movie is much better (and realistic). Aronofsky's work is extremely stylish - he uses plenty of quick, flashy imagery and tends to use speedy camera tricks that alter the audience even, as if we're experiencing what the characters are. And he's successful at it. Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. (and also written by him), the screenplay is amazing. The characters and the dialog are all realistic, and the entire thing is just one bizarre experience.The acting in the film couldn't be any better. Ellen Burstyn is mainly the lead and a lot of attention is focused on her, and she is absolutely brilliant, playing the widowed mother who is desperate for attention, and wants to wear her red dress on television. Only problem is, she needs to lose some weight, so she becomes addicted to dieting pills. She's an excellent actress and is believable as can be, her performance really shined. But the other cast members also shined. Jared Leto is the secondary lead, playing Burstyn's son, and is also great, playing a very complicated character. Jennifer Connelly plays his girlfriend, and she was also amazing - the audience can more easily be in touch with her emotions and you can feel a strong connection to her character, because she kind of becomes caught up in the middle of the drug-hustling that's being done by her boyfriend, and finds herself an addict soon after. And Marlon Wayans, who I'd only seen playing a goofy stoner in the comedy horror-spoof, 'Scary Movie', was excellent in his role too, giving a surprisingly good performance as Leto's best friend/co-drug dealer.'Requiem For A Dream' is a horrific film experience. The way the film ends will haunt you for days, and you won't forget it. It's not a movie that you can sit down and watch repeatedly, because if you did you'd feel horrible. It's an emotionally draining movie, and that's partially why it's so amazing. This film doesn't just focus solely on drugs, but it focuses strongly on how these substances affect the lives of different people, and the tragic results of their decisions. You won't want to miss this movie, but don't expect to feel good when you watch it. A must see. 10/10.",10,1,2,29 December 2006
The Ring," Disturbing and Genuinely Creepy.
","'The Ring' is about a woman named Rachel Keller. She lives with her young son, Aiden in their Seattle apartment, and holds a job as a journalist. She comes upon the story of a bizarre video tape with strange and frightening images. Supposedly, if you watch the tape, the phone rings, and you die seven days later. She is a little skeptical at first, until she begins investigating the death of a teenage girl who died seven days after watching the video. She heads to a cabin in the mountains where the teenage girl was staying with her friends, and comes upon the video itself. After watching it, sure enough, the phone rings. Now a believer in the tape's mysterious power, Rachel begins to uncover the mystery behind it before she becomes the next victim - and she only has seven days to save herself and her son.A remake of a Japanese horror movie, 'The Ring' is a well-made American retelling of the unique, creepy story. Naomi Watts delivers a great performance as the heroine, and does it quite convincingly. The video tape displayed in the movie is really creepy, loaded with all kinds of gruesome images and bizarre things. I really liked the plot of this movie, it was rather original and creepy, aside from all of the unoriginal, dime-a-dozen horror flicks that are carted out constantly. The film may seem to drag a little for those who are so used to the fast paced slasher films, but if you pay attention it's actually quite interesting.Naomi Watts leads the cast as Rachel, and is believable and empathetic - both good things for her character. David Dorffman is her mysterious but intelligent son, and Martin Henderson is Rachel's ex-husband/friend. The cast performs well and all was believable. One thing notable about this film is it's disturbing and vivid visuals, which are really great looking and add the movie's spooky and strange atmosphere. There are plenty of bizarre and scary sequences in this film, mainly in the video tape itself and the horrifying backstory behind it all.Overall, 'The Ring' is a pretty good horror movie, not perfect but very good for sure. I found it to be pretty creepy, and very different from most horror films out there. Definitely see it, it's sure to scare you even if it's the slightest bit. 8/10.",8,3,4,28 July 2006
Hereditary," Visceral and dreadful by turns
","In 'Hereditary,' an artist mother grapples with the death of her mother, a mysterious woman from whom she was long estranged. Her death triggers a succession of tragedies and bizarre events that threaten to unravel her family.I'll keep major plot points unwritten here as I feel the less you know about this film, the better. Multiplex popcorn moviegoers are likely to be bored into tedium by 'Hereditary' (one patron complained about how terribly boring the film was after the screening I was in), and to some degree I can understand why, as the film does sag a bit in the middle; not nearly to the point of derailment though, and what precedes it and follows it more than make up for an feet-dragging.Like many of the indie horrors of this era, 'Hereditary' takes the less-is-more route and reaps significant rewards. It's minimalist but effective, its horror entangled in a family drama that offers enough shocks on its own. The film is expertly photographed and extremely atmospheric; the Utah landscapes and the cavernous craftsman home where most of the action takes place are bewitching; underpinning it all is a simplistic but effective score. While there are some emotionally-shocking moments in the first two-thirds of the film, the last act is where it really cuts loose, giving way to utter pandemonium; even still, there is a subdued nature to the most fantastical elements. Writer-director Ari Aster clearly took cues from 'Rosemary's Baby' in writing the film, and whether or not he intended, he wears this influence on his sleeve; visually, it at times recalls Charles Laughton's 'The Night of the Hunter.' However, the insanity of 'Hereditary' as it builds to its fever pitch is anchored in Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne's core performances; Collette's range is especially made use of here. The younger actors- Alex Wolff, who plays their son, and Milly Shapiro, who plays their eccentric daughter-are also impressive, and Wolff effectively portrays some of the script's most emotionally wrought material.While the film does seem to run itself slightly thin in the middle, I never once lost an ounce of interest, which is a testament to the multitude of strengths working under the surface. While 'Hereditary' certainly doesn't reinvent the wheel, it evokes a crescendo of dread that is effectively disrupted by more visceral terrors. It is not a perfect film, but it's easily the best horror offering I've seen this year thus far.",8,3,12,8 June 2018
Monster," One of the Most Riveting Movies I've Ever Seen.
","'Monster' is the true story of Aileen Wuornos (played phenomenally by Charlize Theron), a Florida prostitute who led a troubled, abuse-ridden life since her early years. Set in the 1980s, Aileen finds love in a shy, sweet young woman named Selby Wall (Christina Ricci). She has hopes and dreams of escaping and living a 'normal' life with Selby. But after she is raped, beaten, and nearly murdered by one of her 'customers', she spirals on a descent into madness and insanity, in which she begins murdering random men (all of them being her clientèle) along the Daytona Beach highways. I don't exactly know where to begin here, besides to say that this is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. It's complex, heartbreaking, shocking, disturbing- and ultimately an all around tragedy. Not to mention the fact that it is a true story, and did in fact happen - this brings it into even a stronger scope of intensity, when taking in mind that all these things did happen. Director/writer Patty Jenkins does a wonderful job here, and it's evident through the script that she put some hard work into making this film - the details are all there, the events and scripting are all impressive and done with flair, and everything is in place as it should be. The murder scenes are realistic and unsettling (the shot of Aileen, standing there in the woods, smoking a cigarette as she stares at the body of her second victim is harrowing), and really make the viewer uncomfortable (as does the horrendous rape scene that sets Wuornos off in the beginning).Now, with the gritty acting details, I have to point out Theron. She has given one of the greatest female performances of all time here, if not just greatest performances of all time. If you should see this film for one reason, it should be solely for her performance, because it's one of the strongest I've ever seen. She is absolutely brilliant - every single detail of her character is spot on. Her dialect, mannerisms, physical demeanor, absolutely everything. Charlize Theron doesn't just 'play' the character here - she IS the character. I was continually impressed by her, from the opening scene of the film to the closing credits. Her performance is riveting, and she well deserved all the praise she received for it, because she truly did a magnificent job. Not only that, but she actually looks so close to the real Aileen that it is almost scary - her transformation from a gorgeous, tall blonde to a rugged prostitute (mentally and physically) is sheerly impressive. Christina Ricci is also great as always in her role as Aileen's naive, good-hearted love interest - but really, Theron does out-shine everybody.I'd also like to take in the fact of the real Aileen Wuornos herself. The presentation of her in this film is fairly accurate as are the events. But rather than play on Wuornos' wretched childhood and horrible life-long abuse as an excuse for her actions, it simply presents them as they are. Yes, Aileen Wuornos did have a horrible life. Yes, she was horribly abused and psychologically damaged because of it. And yes, she was in fact guilty of murdering several men, and all but one of them is somewhat excusable. But despite all of her awful history and brutal actions, she was in fact a person. She had emotions, hopes, dreams, and was endlessly looking for real love, which she found in Selby. In the end, though, she had to pay the price for her actions.Overall, 'Monster' is an incredible film. It does a magnificent job of capturing the time, the events, and the characters in this gut-wrenching true story, to the point that the audience almost feels as if they are right there. Magnificent performances (most notably Theron) really make this film stand out, but it's a powerful and horrific story nonetheless- tragic, compelling, and at times hard to watch. It gives deep insight into an incredibly damaged woman that found herself on an inexcusable path of violence, murder, and destruction that she couldn't seem to escape. 10/10.",10,0,2,27 December 2008
Dawn of the Dead," I'm Not A Zombie Fan, But I Liked This.
","The 'Dawn of the Dead' remake is one good zombie flick, I'm the first to admit it. I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies, I prefer slashers and supernatural horror, but this movie stuck in my mind for a while and was an excellent remake of the zombie classic. It basically is the same plot line as George Romero's original version- people hiding out in a shopping mall after zombies began to walk the earth and mankind begins to die off. The group of people who wind up in the mall begin to bond and form friendships, while the dead are outside taking over the world. They think they are safe, but little do they know, one of the women staying with them was bitten by a zombie, and is now giving birth to a zombie infant. As time goes on and they begin to run out of natural necessities, they face the fact that they can only stay in the mall for so long, before they run out of food and water. They decide it's best to break out of the mall and fight against the zombies in a mad dash for survival.The performances in this film were great, Sarah Polley was excellent as the leading heroine in the film. The characters here kick some serious zombie ass, but sadly they fail in the end, and the zombies win (you have to watch the entire credits to actually see this). The interactions with the characters were genuine and well acted, it was interesting to watch them as they go through such a drastic and bad situation. Can you imagine zombies taking over the world? The gore and zombie makeup effects looked great, and there were plenty of action sequences that were enjoyable and entertaining to watch. I especially enjoyed the scene where the characters actually break out of the mall, armed with a load of weapons, in their zombie-proof buses.The ending was abrupt and harsh, but I think it fit the brutality of the film very well. Bottom line is - good acting + good story + lots of gore = very good zombie film. All in all, this is an above average zombie movie, and horror fans should enjoy it. Not to mention, it's excellent for a remake. 8/10.",8,2,4,23 March 2005
Hostel," Ridiculously Over Hyped.
","I might get ragged on for not particularly liking this film, but I honestly thought it was way below average. 'Hostel' starts off with three male friends vacationing in Europe, one of them being from Poland. The three guys are basically looking for girls and drugs, and Amsterdam is the perfect place for that. From there, they meet a guy who directs them to a youth Hostel in Slovakia, where the girls are apparently willing to do anything. So, the hormone crazed guys head that way. After arriving, they find the girls are great, but after time goes by strange things begin to happen, and after both of his friends go missing, the leader of the group, Paxton, is lead to an old abandoned building by one of the girls from the hostel. From there on, the blood begins to spill, and he discovers that the old abandoned building is used for wealthy businessman who pay to torture and brutally kill innocent travelers, just for the 'thrill of it'.Eli Roth does a good job and completely disgusting his audience, there are some pretty brutal torture scenes here, and I will admit it gets pretty nasty. Yet, 'Hostel' still felt like your below-average horror film to me, full of cheap nudity and sex, and some intense gore scenes to go along with it. The first 45 minutes of the movie felt like the teenage comedy 'Eurotrip', and then it takes a dark turn. Still, this movie was a huge letdown, because the concept is actually really scary. Unfortunately, this movie was a mess. It felt comic at times when brutal things where happening, and made the atmosphere all too unrealistic, and completely unbelievable (an example being the town children attacking the bad guys, come on). For Roth's 2003 horror film, 'Cabin Fever', the comic side of it worked, but with 'Hostel', the comedy played into it makes it seem way too cheesy, and not serious enough. I was expecting much more, and it turned out to be far below average, despite all of the insane hype that the movie has gotten. I don't understand it.I guess it just depends what kind of movies you like. 'Hostel' is a brutal, gory, movie, with a bunch of nudity and sex, and I felt like I'd seen it all before. It all depends on taste though, and it just wasn't the right movie for me. It wasn't scary, I didn't care at all about the characters, it hardly had any plot at all, it was just disgusting. Had this movie had a much more serious tone and more plot development, it could've been a good movie. But it had neither of those things. If a couple of brainless hours of sex and torture make a good movie for you, then enjoy. For me, this movie failed. 3/10.",3,0,0,20 April 2006
Green Room," Tension galore
","'Green Room' follows a vagabond punk band traveling through Oregon, where they book a show at what they come to find out is a neo-nazi skinhead punk club. The show goes well enough, but after they become witnesses to a murder, the group—along with a female regular at the club— are held hostage at the instruction of the community's head honcho.I went into 'Green Room' with little expectations, unsure of what exactly to expect; I'd heard good things about it, and the fact that it was filmed in the area I grew up in further piqued my interest. The film undoubtedly deserves the critical and public attention it's gotten, especially from horror fans, though I'm hesitant to necessarily label it a 'horror' film. It's more a suspense-thriller akin to something like 'Panic Room,' except with a starkly different setting and a group of twenty-something punksters in place of the family home invasion prototype. What is perhaps most jarring about the film is that its entire premise springs out of a wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time scenario that spirals entirely out of control. The script and direction lend an increasing oppressiveness that comes on like a vice grip; the audience can easily sympathize with the arbitrariness of the entire premise, and the claustrophobic sense of inescapability is well-drawn out on screen. The film is nicely shot with emphasis on darkness and its titular color, and the photography of the landscapes effectively capture the ominousness of rainy Oregon backcountry.Solid performances from all involved further elevate the film. For a film that's plot is so constricted, the material demands solid performers, and we get that from the young cast, with Patrick Stewart effectively playing counterpoint as the aloof villain-in-charge with an army of intimidating henchmen. The film's finale is extremely effective, and, barring a few convenient plot devices, is more or less believable.Overall, 'Green Room' was one of more tense experiences I've had at the movies in quite awhile. The way writer/director Jeremy Saulnier is able to spin such an arbitrary, unfortunate situation into an oppressive, character-driven splatter thriller is remarkable. It may not be enough to turn off punks from their waking-up-in-urine-and-beer lifestyle, but it's enough to make any prospective venues in the Pacific Northwest backwoods seem at the very least questionable. A recommended nailbiter. 9/10.",9,56,111,15 April 2016
The Babadook," Trauma turns to terror
","'The Babadook' centers on a widow whose son's increasing investment in fantasy begins to take over her life. His fantasy world is exacerbated and turns nightmarish after she reads him a bizarre storybook she found in his bedroom, about a mythical monster called 'the Babadook.' Initially dismissive of his claims of the monster's presence in their home, the entity becomes very real and very dangerous.Although it is very much a horror film in more ways than one, 'The Babdook' is, at its core, a meditation on grief. It takes a parable approach with the nightmarish fable as a method of delivery, but it is really a film about family trauma and how we deal with loss. Jennifer Kent has extracted all of these private horrors and splayed them on screen for us to see in sublimated and yet explicit ways. The film is very much psychological and a bit of a slowburn until it finally lets loose in the last half hour. Tim Burton-esque special effects are both dreamlike and intimidating, but the real terror of the film is what's left to the imagination. The knocks at the door and the re-emergence of the book on the family's doorstep are minor examples of the subtle spookiness at play.Essie Davis' performance is outstanding here, and her chemistry with on screen-son Noah Wiseman is spot-on. Since it's a film with a fairly small number of characters, it's detrimental that the main players here are able to convince, and do they ever. Truly incredible performances that we rarely see in horror films.Overall, 'The Babadook' is a dazzling patchwork of fantasy, horror, and family drama written as a fable but intended as a parable. The script is smart and the performances are even smarter, and the film is transfixing even when it's slow. Definitely one of the more original (and well-crafted) post-millennial horror offerings. 8/10.",8,4,10,29 January 2015
The Others," Delightfully Spooky, Old-Fashioned Ghost Story.
","'The Others' is an excellent blend of suspense, horror, and mystery. It has a great story, some great acting, and I thought it was pretty scary. But you have to like ghost stories to enjoy this. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a mother who lives in a dark, old island mansion in the 1940's, with her two children, Anne and Nicholas, who are allergic to the sunlight. After some servants arrive to their darkened home, strange events begin to plague Grace and her children. As things get stranger and stranger, Grace becomes convinced that her home is haunted, and she begins to suspect something strange about the servants. Is the house really haunted? Or is there something even more disturbing going on? Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar brings this delightfully eerie ghost picture to the screen, in the vein of Jack Clayton's 1961 chiller, 'The Innocents', and Robert Wise's 'The Haunting'. The story is nicely crafted here, and while the similarities between this and 'The Innocents' are obvious, 'The Others' is definitely it's own movie. Fans of slow-going, old-fashioned horror films will love this, because of the steady pacing that still manages to send chills up the spine. It's a bit of a slow film in the beginning, but things do pick up, and there is plenty going on in the meantime to keep the audience intrigued. The entire movie is done in the style of those classic haunted house stories we know. A very dark and Gothic atmosphere is prevalent as well, and director Amenabar captures some very eerie images and some excellently-constructed scare sequences. As for the twist-ending, I have to give some major credit for it. I never saw it coming, and it fit the story perfectly, completely reversing whatever ideas you had about the film. The acting is also great, Nicole Kidman plays her role as the eccentric mother perfectly, and Fionnula Flanagan plays one of the kindly new servants to the household nicely, as do the rest of them. And the children playing Kidman's son and daughter were also very remarkable in their roles.Overall, 'The Others' is a classy and Gothic ghost story, reminiscent of those haunted-house classics we all remember. This film sets up an intense atmosphere - very dark, subtle, and old-fashioned. I enjoyed it. If you like this kind of movie, surely see it, you won't be disappointed. 'The Others' is a great example of what a genuinely good ghost story should be like. 9/10.",9,0,1,30 May 2006
Orphan," Satisfying and Surprisingly Disturbing 'Child Killer' Thriller.
","'Orphan' focuses on Kate (Vera Farmiga), a former Yale piano instructor and recovering alcoholic, and her husband, John (Peter Sarsgaard). They have two children: pre-teenaged Daniel and four-year-old Maxine, 'Max', who is almost entirely deaf. After Kate has a stillborn, it leaves the couple unhappy, and they decide on adoption, which leads them to a prim and well-mannered 9 year old Russian girl named Esther. She seems like the perfect child; she's well versed, a talented painter, and favors old-fashioned dresses and hair ribbons to jeans and t-shirts. They decide that she is the one. Unfortunately, for Kate and John, they made a very big mistake, because Esther is not what she appears to be at all. Her deceptive nature and manipulatory tactics are seen by Kate very soon after she comes to live with them, but nobody else seems to notice - and a series of 'accidents' and misfortunes seem to follow Esther wherever she goes, which increase in violence and put everyone in danger.Based on advertisements, 'Orphan' may appear to be a run-of-the-mill 'evil kid' flick that we've seen time and time again. But don't be led to think that, or you will miss out on what is quite likely the best horror film of the year thus far. The film is directed by Jaume Collett-Sera, who was behind 2005's 'House of Wax' (which, while many people did not seem to like it, I thought it was a fairly good horror movie), and it's a stylish one at that - much more mature than 'House of Wax', though, in both themes and direction, and with a more mature cast as well. The camera-work is sleek and effective, and the film is very visually attractive, with its stark wintry New England setting (which is so wonderfully appropriate for this type of film if I may say so myself) and impressive house constructions.As for the disturbing nature of the film which I mention in my summary line, I was surprised at how irked I was by some of the scenes in this film. I think it mostly was because they were such awful, horrific things that involved such young children, but it was bothersome nonetheless. Esther's manipulation of the Coleman children is also interesting and puts them in a handful of awful situations. The murder scenes and graphic details are presented realistically as well, which, when combined with young kids, make for some very disturbing viewing material, probably even more so for parents. Besides this, the 'scary' factor of the film is somewhere in the middle. There's some cheap jump scares and a couple of 'gotcha!' moments, which won't be too effective for seasoned horror fans. However, the film makes up for this in suspense, which is wound tight as the film progresses from its rather leisurely opening act. In terms of acting, it is, in a word, impressive. Vera Farmiga is our leading lady, who acts as a sort of guide throughout the film, with whom we are able to empathize with, and she plays it well. Her husband, played by Peter Sarsgaard, is disbelieving of Esther's rotten other side, and while his role is typical, he performs well. Now, on to the children - both actors who portray the Coleman kids show talent (especially the youngest daughter, who is playing a deaf-mute child).And at the center of the show, there is Isabelle Fuhrman as our villain - little orphan Esther. While all the acting in the film is impressive, Fuhrman's is the most so, probably because this is her first feature film, and she, at 12 years old, was able to tackle such a complex and mature role and play it perfectly. Her character is a two-faced little devil, as we know from the start- manipulative, intelligent, and has a whole dress pocket full of tricks. Part of you wants to hug her because of her sweet smile, prim disposition, and cute Russian accent - and the other part of you wants to kick her in the face because you know that underneath it all she's actually a sociopathic murderess. She's a frustrating character to say the least, and a creepy one at that. Farmiga has a few moments with her that provide the audience with some well-deserved catharsis, including a swift slap in the face in a hospital scene that knocks Esther to the floor and produces cheers from the audience. It's all good fun.Now, as for the twist - well, I won't reveal it here, because that wouldn't be fair to anyone. It's a very clever one, and while I found its revelation to be a little underwhelming, it is still great nonetheless. Once it is revealed, there are pieces of the film that come together and little moments that will suddenly make complete sense - so, in that vein, the writing here is well-laced and very fluid. I don't think I've seen a twist quite like this before in all my years of watching horror films, so I was happy with it. The film ends on the ultimate cathartic note, and it closes appropriately with a shot of the wintry Connecticut forest.In closing, 'Orphan' is a classy and solid film. It takes the evil child premise that audiences have seen before and tweaks the ending with a twist that is so clever it hurts. On top of that, there is visually appealing scenery and cinematography, a continuous thread of suspense peppered with some very disturbing material, impressive acting (especially from the children), some laughs, and a handful of lofty moments that will have the crowd giddy with satisfaction. Horror fans and general audiences will receive a little bit of everything in 'Orphan', so it makes from an all-around good time at the movies. 8/10.",8,3,7,1 August 2009
Zodiac," Captivating, In-Depth Look At The Zodiac Investigation.
","'Zodiac', based on the book by Robert Graysmith (and also based on the real-life killing spree), centers around the city of San Francisco. Beginning on July 4th, 1969, a young couple are shot to death in their car, the man surviving. This series of random, brutal slayings continues throughout the 1970s, and the daunting killer sends letters and codes to local newspapers and police, calling himself the 'Zodiac'. As murders occur in both Northern and Southern California, the Zodiac has the entire state living in fear. A cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), slowly becomes obsessed with the case, and devotes his entire life to catching the killer, while his colleagues, Inspector David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.), his wife Melanie (Chloe Sevigny), and others look on.Quite possibly the best crime-thriller I've encountered since 'The Silence of the Lambs', 'Zodiac' is a truly amazing motion picture. I was held captive in this film's spell from the grisly opening scene, and couldn't keep away from the screen for the following two and a half hours, so that tells me this movie did something right. Based on the real-life killings, this film is also based upon the book by Robert Graysmith, which chronicled his actual experiences in the Zodiac case, and the film is told through his eyes as well. My knowledge of the actual Zodiac case itself is rather sketchy, and I'm only familiar with some details, but from what I know, this is a very accurate telling of the murders and the investigation, and I was happy with that, because it seems most true-crime films twist, remove, and add things a bit for storytelling purposes. Luckily, this movie works well and is much scarier because it tells things closely to how they happened (and not to mention through the eyes of someone who was involved in the investigation).David Fincher (who is responsible for 'Fight Club', a favorite of mine, among others) directs this film, and I can't say there is a better choice. His direction is stylish, and the cinematography, like in all his films, is stunning. Great angles, good editing, and some really nicely done insertions of code cipherings in a particular sequence really stand out. This isn't a horror movie, it's a dramatic crime thriller, but the suspense and tension is magnificently mounted and it builds and builds as the movie flows toward its conclusion. It's a rather lengthy film, spanning a little over two and a half hours, but I was surprised at how quickly everything seemed to go by. It felt more like your average hour and forty-five minute movie, so that also tells me that the script is tight and doesn't lose its audience's interest easily. Even the investigation work (which is what the majority of this film consists of) is interesting, which may come as a surprise, because one would probably think that it would be yawn-some, but it's not. I found myself thinking about this movie long after I'd watched it, and the mystique of the entire case and the particular storytelling here is all really intriguing. Not to mention those disturbing and realistic murder sequences featured in the film, which I found to be extremely chilling because of how real they felt. The killer is brought to the screen in a realistic manner in this movie, and he's not some silent, unstoppable force of evil, like some slasher film villain. He has a real, earthly quality about him in this film, and I think for that, his character is even scarier.The cast is amazing here, everyone in this film gave stunning performances. Jake Gyllenhaal leads the cast as our protagonist, and is excellent. He's followed by Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr., who both turn in solid performances as well (Ruffalo plays the police chief to a T, and Downey Jr. is good for a few laughs, but also seriousness). Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's wife, Melanie, and is also very good here, even though she's not introduced until midway through the film. A few others you may recognize include Dermot Mulroney, Phillip Baker Hall (who starred in the 2005 film 'The Zodiac', about the same topic), Clea DuVall, and James LeGros, all who do great jobs. The film's conclusion leans toward one plausible theory of the Zodiac's identity, but also has a good sense of ambiguity to keep things mysterious. To this day, the Zodiac killer has still never been caught. But, according to Graysmith, the identity of the killer is obvious, judging from his investigation. Overall, 'Zodiac' is a suspenseful and unsettling crime-thriller that cannot be missed, especially by those who find interest in the Zodiac case, or anyone who has read Graysmith's novel. This is a captivating and shuddering look at the Zodiac killer and the investigation to reveal his identity. This is surely the best film that I have yet to see about these events, the others will simply pale in comparison. Throw in some top-notch direction & cinematography, solid suspense, and great acting, all fastened together by a wonderful script, and you've got what I consider one of the best true-crime suspense thrillers in years. 10/10.",10,0,2,7 August 2007
Sleepy Hollow," Gruesome, Atmospheric, and Darkly Comic.
","I saw this film a few Thanksgivings back, and I thought it was an excellent piece of cinema. After recently rewatching it, my feelings are still the same. 'Sleepy Hollow' revolves around the quirky Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), who is sent to the small secluded village of Sleepy Hollow, New York, that is living in fear after a series of brutal slayings by a supposed supernatural figure, the Headless Horseman. An investigator and attorney, Ichabod is skeptical about the horseman. When arriving at the small colonial village, he stays with the wealthiest family in town - the Van Tassels, who have a lengthy legacy behind them. He is soon 'bewitched' by the Van Tassels daughter, Katrina (Christina Ricci), and begins to have his own experiences with the headless horseman - convincing him that the horseman is no myth, and is actually the one responsible for the series of beheadings. But there is a little more to the Horseman than the townspeople know of, and it's up to him to find out.The strongest element of this film by a long shot is the beautiful imagery. The small village, the woods surrounding it, and all the scenery is breathtaking - it looks like it came straight out of a fairytale. The village is dark and foggy, and the woods are very desolate with twisted, leaf-less trees. This sets up a very strong atmosphere, and the film takes place during the Thanksgiving/fall season, so that is another addition to film's overall feel. The special effects are also great, the supernatural Headless Horseman is very creepy, and the beheadings and deaths in the film are both convincing and grim. Everything Tim Burton does is with style, and he shows it off a lot in this movie. The plot is derived from 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' by Washington Irving, a classic American tale. Those who are familiar with the old Disney cartoon version of the 'Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman' will want to beware of this film, because it is much more violent and gruesome than the tame, children's cartoon, and there are some very neat spins put on the story to make it a much more dark, evil-themed film.The performances in the film are perfect - Johnny Depp plays the squeamish Ichabod with both seriousness and comedy. In fact, the film does include a lot of comic undertones and some flat-out funny scenes involving his character, that contrast with the bloody carnage that is taking place. Christina Ricci plays Katrina very well herself, she's innocent but mysterious, and has good chemistry with the Ichabod character. Behind the two leads are Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson, playing the Van Tassels, Casper Van Dien as Brom - a macho guy who is trying to woo Katrina, and Christopher Walken as the Headless horseman, in life of course. Bottom line - 'Sleepy Hollow' is an excellent film. It's both scary and darkly comic at the same time, with a very well-written story and good performances. If you're considering seeing this film, do. If not for the story itself, the imagery and scenery are reason enough. But expect something much more grim and violent than the Disney cartoon. 9/10.",9,1,2,22 November 2006
Silent Hill," An Intense, Atmospheric Nightmare.
","'Silent Hill' is one of the better horror films I've seen this year (so far at least). It has a really interesting story (based on a video game), great special effects, good acting, and some intense scary moments.'Silent Hill' starts with Rose DaSilva, who wakes up to find her daughter, Sharon, missing from her house in the middle of the night. She runs down to a waterfall and saves Sharon, who was about to fall off the cliff while sleepwalking. Sharon continues to scream 'Silent Hill!' in her dreams, so Rose decides to take her daughter to the abandoned ghost town to try and help. Bad, bad mistake. As they arrive to Silent Hill, Rose crashes the car after almost hitting a young girl, and wakes up to find Sharon gone. But there seems to be something strange about the town now. There is an eerie fog that blankets it, and ashes fall from the sky like snowflakes. Unknowningly, Rose and Sharon are taken into an entire different dimension, and Rose must fight off evil creatures that are linked to the town's gruesome past, and save Sharon before it's too late.I've only played a tiny bit of the video game, 'Silent Hill 3', so I really have no idea what goes on in the games. But from how I understand it, this movie combines elements from all the games, and molding them together in one movie. Director Christophe Gans creates a very atmospheric setting, and the makeup and effects in this movie were wonderful. The plot is molded precisely and leaves lots of of twists and turns through the course of the film. There are plenty of slick visuals, amazing sets, and some twisted creatures that are all really amazing looking. The film looks great, I was really impressed with the sets and cinematography. Plenty of very scary moments abound, and there is also good acting from all involved.Basically, if you are a fan of horror films, go see this. Whether you have played the games or not, you'll still enjoy the movie just as much, I really don't think it matters. 'Silent Hill' is an original and very scary way to spend a couple of hours. 9/10.",9,0,1,30 April 2006
Final Destination 2," Same Concept, New Characters, New Deaths.
","'Final Destination 2' is very similar to it's original counterpart, with the exact same concept, with some more creative deaths and new characters. The film is about a teenage girl named Kimbery (AJ Cook), who is your normal teenager. While driving with some friends on a highway, she has a premonition of a horrible pileup after a log truck loses it's lumber, killing her and many others. Quickly thinking, she blocks up the freeway, stopping a handful of strangers who would have died from cruising into death's arms. But when the people she miraculously saved from death begin to die in odd ways, it seems that Death is coming back for them. After seeking help from Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), who is now contained in a mental hospital, fearing that Death is still out to get her, it's up to Kimberly to keep all of those who she saved from dying. But is it really possible to cheat your way out of death? Unfortunately, for this unlucky slew of people, it isn't. This film has the same premise as the original, this time the horrible event being a major highway accident (and our hero is a female) and introduces some new characters who are next to fall in Death's arms. There isn't a lot to say about the story really, since it is so similar to the original, so I'll focus on the deaths in the film. This time around, the inventive death sequences are even more clever and complicated, and much bloodier and shocking than the original film. The most memorable deaths would have to be the one at the dentist's office and the one at the farm field, the ideas the writers came up with were so creative it was surreal. The actors this time around were all good, and Ali Larter reprised her role as Clear, who sadly meets a grim fate near the film's conclusion (which this time was also left open for another sequel).Overall, 'Final Destination 2' is worth seeing just for it's extremely creative ways that it picks off the characters one by one. There are some extremely memorable moments throughout, and the movie was enjoyable for the most part. Definitely see it if you enjoyed the original, it's a good follow-up.",7,0,0,27 August 2006
Taxi Driver," Thought Provoking, Disturbing, and Excellent.
","Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' is an intense urban classic that has disturbed and provoked audiences since it's release. The film centers around the character of Travis Bickle (masterfully played by Robert De Niro), a previous Vietnam veteran, who is living in downtown New York City in a rough-and-tumble area, living like a loner. His job is a taxi driver - so naturally, he gets to meet a lot of people, including a young woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepard), and a teenage hooker, Iris (Jodie Foster). But Travis is one disturbed individual. And as he sees the 'scum' of the city through his eyes, he ultimately takes it upon himself to violently lash out at the sleazy underside of the city, and plans on executing the city Senator.'Taxi Driver' - simply put - is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story is a semi-autobiography on Paul Schrader (the writer of the film), who was reflecting on his experiences when he apparently had a mental breakdown himself. Throw in a master director like Martin Scorsese, some top-of-the-line actors (Robert De Niro, Jodie Foster), combined with the intriguing plot, and you've got a really great movie. De Niro is the most remarkable thing about the film - he plays Travis precisely - his mannerisms, expressions, monologues - everything just worked perfectly. The character he played was disturbing, and his performance brought the character to life perfectly. The film is full of vivid performances, I can't say anything bad about any of the players. The last 45 minutes of the film were among the most disturbing of it all, but the film was one giant buildup to the film's conclusion, and was both suspenseful but enthralling. The score, done by Bernard Herrman, who was also behind Hitchcock's 'Psycho', gives a very haunting and memorable score to go along with the film. Again, (I can't stress this enough) DeNiro's portrayal of the mysterious and menacing Max Cady is the film's real strong point though, and that alone makes it worth watching.Overall, 'Taxi Driver' is a haunting classic, and is a film that you will likely remember for a long time to come. If the story and direction isn't enough to make you want to see the film, the actors and masterful performances should be a good enough reason. Wonderful, disturbing, excellence. 10/10.",10,0,0,18 November 2006
Nightcrawler," Editing reality
","Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a desperate Los Angeles man, thrusts himself into the work of crime journalism, filming crime scenes and accidents to sell out to local news stations. After acquiring a sidekick, Lou's success and business partnership with a local news director (Rene Russo) afford him a level of personal success, but the extent to which he's willing to go for his work edges into an increasingly moral grey area.Going into 'Nightcrawler' with a minimal knowledge of what the film was about, I was really surprised at its content; the entire profession of 'night crawling' was something I'd never even thought about, so the film was fascinating just on a logistical level for that reason alone. Throw in a perfectly illustrated sociopathic antihero and top notch performances, and my expectations were far exceeded.While the film toys with the darker social mechanics of morality and journalism, there's a consistent undertone of dark humor that pervades throughout Gyllenhaal's performance, bubbling up in idiosyncrasies and one-liners, but 'Nightcrawler' never allows itself to enter the territory of camp or silliness. There's a very sour core to the film, which is embellished with a sweet surface of slick cinematography and editing, and the smarminess of Gyllenhaal's disturbed and borderline translucent character is a large part of this. Rene Russo's performance as an equally desperate news director is on par with Gyllenhaal, and the role provides her not only a respectable platform for her return to the screen, but plenty of space to show just how great of an actress she is. Support from Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton is all solid as well.Overall, 'Nightcrawler' is as befuddling as it is engaging. I left the theater with an unpleasant feeling, and therefore take it that the film was effective at at least one thing. Though it is a slow burn with marginal payoff by Hollywood standards, it is an engaging and incredibly well acted film that deserves an audience for those reasons alone. Social commentary or not, it's a glossy and subtly disturbing venture into the art of unease. 8/10.",8,1,5,11 November 2014
The Hills Have Eyes," Best Horror Remake So Far? I'd Say So.
","I have seen many horror movies in my day, and this is by far one of the nastiest, most intense horror movies I think I've ever seen. 'The Hills Have Eyes' remake follows the Carter family, who are on their way to California. After taking advice from an old gas-station attendant (bad mistake), they take a shortcut that supposedly goes through the hill and hits the freeway from there. Unfortunately, they hit some bumps in the road, and their tires are blown out after driving over a string of spikes. The father sets out to get help, and the oldest sister's husband goes in the other direction for help. As night falls, the family starts getting hunted down by a crazy family of deformed cannibals, and the blood starts to flow - like a river.Alexandre Aja (who brought us the brutal French horror flick, 'High Tension') gives the remake some new folds that make it a bit more interesting and different from the original, although most of the film is very similar to Craven's original film. We get more of a back story on the mutant cannibals, and it turns out that they were descendants of miners who were exposed to radiation when the U.S. government conducted nuclear tests in the New Mexico desert. Another addition to the film is their residence, and in the remake they inhabit a town filled with mannequins that was used in the testing on how nuclear weapons would affect communities.The acting here is excellent, and the whole cast does a great job at invoking terror and dread as we see them go through an unimaginable situation. I actually felt bad for the family, it's hard to even imagine yourself in a situation like that. The cannibals are new and improved, and even more violent and insane this time around - the makeup is great and they look really disgusting. While they are much less human-like than in the original, they are scary nonetheless.Overall, I'd say this is probably the best remake I've yet to see. Beware though, it is very brutal and violent. There was actually someone who threw up in my theater, so those with weak stomachs probably shouldn't watch it. To sum it up, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is a wild ride, filled with intense violence, insanity, and terror. Aja does the original film justice. I'll give it a nine, pushing a ten. 9/10.",9,1,3,12 March 2006
The Orphanage," Treads Common Ground, But Is Well-Crafted, Engrossing, And Frightening Nonetheless.
","'El Orfanato' (or 'The Orphanage', in its English title) is a horror film that centers on Laura (Belen Rueda), a woman who was raised in a large orphanage where she spent her childhood. With fond memories of the place, she moves back with her husband Carlos, and adopted son, Simon, with plans to open an orphanage for disabled children of her own. But strange things begin to plague Laura - a mysterious social worker after her son stalks the grounds, and Simon has gained some bizarre imaginary friends. And during the celebration of the orphanage's opening, Simon disappears into thin air, and Laura finds herself desperate to put the pieces together and find her son. What ensues is a dark journey into the house's past and a mystery involving the children that lived there over 30 years ago.Highly praised and longly awaited, 'The Orphanage' is a horror movie that pleases on nearly all levels. The rave for this movie was fairly large, and my expectations were high going in, and thankfully, they were met. From my brief synopsis, this may sound like something you have see a dozen times, and I'm not going to lie - 'The Orphanage' borrows many ideas and uses set-ups we have seen before - but the reason it is such an excellent movie is because of a number of factors. First of all, the script is well-written. The story is well-told and the central mystery at the core of the plot is fantastic. Not only that, but the story has a heart. It's got feeling and emotion, something rare in many horror films. It's at times quite touching, especially toward the end (but I won't go there), but still manages to balance the drama with enough shocks and scares to earn it it's horror label.Through its entire running time, this movie only contains one bit of violence, with lasts no more than fifteen seconds, but it still manages to evoke chills through it's atmosphere and story, which is rare in American horror cinema, which has been clogged with explicitly-violent 'horror' movies that really lack any value. While it's been stated many times, violence does not make a movie scary - sure, it can accompany a solid story and that isn't bad, but when an entire movie is just gratuitous violence, there is nothing frightening about it, it's just there for the shock factor, and I enjoy films like 'The Orphanage' that avoid that and actually make an effort to get a genuine fright out of the audience.The suspense is wonderful, and it tightens slowly as the movie builds toward its climax, peppering plenty of scary moments and eerie scenes throughout, all while doing a sufficient job at clearly presenting the story. The production design enhances the spookiness, the house itself is menacing and very Gothic and old-fashioned, sometimes reminiscent of films like 'The Others', and 'Darkness' (both being foreign-produced movies, both in Spain as well). Orphanages are potentially eerie places to begin with, and while the 'ghost' children are rarely seen, they are menacing nonetheless. The sheer sight of Simon's friend Tomas (with his hack-sack mask with a buttoned eye) is downright terrifying, especially when he is first seen by the Laura character in the hallway - that scene sticks out in my mind and probably will for days. Acting-wise, this film is also quite successful. Belen Rueda carries the movie and is brilliant in her performance. The rest of the cast performs well, but honestly, most of them are overshadowed by Rueda's performance - she was really excellent in her role, and, even despite the language barrier, her acting still comes through. The twist-ending was one of the biggest and most upsetting shocks of the movie, and I found myself with my jaw nearly dropped to the floor. But, the movie ended on a pleasant, very uplifting and touching note - another horror rarity. The heart-felt moments and very 'human' elements are what would make me say that this a 'horror' movie that people who despise horror movies would probably enjoy. It's frightening, but the story and themes are relate-able.Overall, 'The Orphanage' is an exceptional horror film that treads common ground, but manages to keep it interesting and tell an intelligent, engrossing, and scary story. The style is unique as well, and the entire film is extremely well-crafted, with a really heart-warming conclusion. Again, do not let the language barrier put you off from seeing it, reading subtitles is not that difficult, and you will miss out on a great horror movie. 'The Orphanage' is a large cut above most to horror movies to come out in the recent past, and is heaps better than most of the horror garbage that is carted out of Hollywood. Well worth seeing if it's showing near you, I saw it with a large group downtown and everyone in the theater seemed to enjoy it. 9/10.",9,7,12,11 January 2008
The Shining," Psychological Terror At Its Finest.
","'The Shining' is based on Stephen King's equally-terrifying book, and is about a family - Jack (Jack Nicholson), Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and their son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who go to be temporary caretakers at the Overlook Hotel during the winter season while it's closed. Everything begins to change soon when they arrive at the hotel, and Jack finds out that one of the previous caretakers took an axe, slaughtered his wife, and his two twin girls, slicing them into tiny pieces. Wendy begins to notice strange behavior in Jack, and meanwhile Danny realizes he has the ability the 'shine', or to read minds without speaking, and experiencing visions of past events.I saw 'The Shining' at a very young age (I was about nine or ten years old), and afterwards I couldn't sleep for days. Truly a marvel of psychological horror, this is likely one of the scariest horror movies of all time. Stephen King's novel was excellent as well, and this film adaptation is probably the best of all of them (I'd say ''Salem's Lot' comes in second place). The plot is thick and complex, and the crafting of it is truly masterful. And this film brings all of King's visions to life in a horrifying manner. Director Kubrick uses some excellent camera-work that should be noted for - lots of long pans, zooms, and lengthy shots that add a certain style to the film (his style, perhaps). The film's bizarre ending may be a little hard to understand, but as a note, it is much different from the novel, as is a lot of the film.But there is a handful of truly bizarre (but truly petrifying) scenes in this movie that are guaranteed to stick with you for years, I know they did me. Everything from the blood-filled elevator, the woman in room 237, and the iconic murdered twin girls who roam the halls of the Overlook, make for some extremely terrifying scenes. Great acting from Jack Nicholson as well as the paranoid, crazed Jack, probably one of his best performances ever (besides 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'). Shelley Duvall is also wonderful as Jack's hysterical and terrified wife, and Danny Lloyd plays their son well too. Although some don't agree, this is one scary movie. The intense, claustrophobic atmosphere and the overall scary plot are what make it such a terrifying film. Another neat piece of info is that I live about a half an hour away from Mt. Hood in Oregon, and they shot the exteriors at the Timberline Lodge, which makes the lodge an interesting attraction to visit. Anyways, this is a truly terrifying movie, probably one of the creepiest I think I've seen. Definitely a must-see for horror fans. 10/10.",10,0,1,1 June 2006
Disturbia," Very Surprised - A Seriously Suspenseful Nail-Biter.
","'Disturbia' is about a teenager named Kale (Shia LaBeouf), who has grown depressed after his father died in a horrible car crash. The withdrawn teenager finds himself in more trouble, much to the dismay of his mother (Carrie-Anne Moss), and ends up put on house arrest for the entire summer - three months locked away in his homelike a prisoner. He begins watching the outside world through binoculars, and forms a relationship with a girl who just moved into the neighborhood, Ashley (Sarah Roemer). But his spying of the local residents uncovers something he wasn't expecting - he sees Mr. Turner (David Morse), a shy, older man, under strange circumstances - women showing up at his house, blood splattering over the windows, screams, and other bizarre things that lead Kale, Ashley, and his friend Ronnie to believe that Mr. Turner is a serial killer. The three begin to stalk the man for more clues, but soon find themselves in more danger than they bargained for.Okay, okay, I wasn't thinking this film was going to be very good. I mean, PG-13 horror/thrillers generally are pretty poor (filled with tiresome 'jump' scares and awful CGI computer effects), so I wasn't expecting much out of this, but I had heard some good things so I decided I had to rent it. And, much to my surprise, I was completely blown away at how good it turned out to be! Quite obviously a modern-day homage to Hitchock's film 'Rear Window', which boasts a very similar premise, 'Disturbia' is one heck of a thriller. In terms of storyline, we've seen this idea done before - person witnesses murder next-door from their upstairs window. DePalma's 'Sisters' and Hitchock's 'Rear Window' are a couple of films that come to mind for the use of this idea, but it's done in a refreshing manner here for modern audiences, and what can I say - it was great! Not much happens within the first forty-five minutes or so of the movie, we only get the general idea of our villain, but we get to know the characters first and there is some comedy thrown in. The second half, however, is pretty intense and things get darker as the movie progresses.Suspense runs rampant in this movie, and I was surprised at how often I found myself on the edge of my seat, chewing on my fingernails. The scene between Ashely and Mr. Turner in the car, and the final twenty minutes or so are both excellent examples of some genuine suspense. The scripting is solid and the possible areas where you'd think a plot hole may be hidden are filled, which was also a big surprise. While there are a couple of good jumps, the movie also shies away from the over-abundance of jump scares found in this type of film (and genre, in particular) these days, and there aren't too many clichés, either. The scariness is mostly found in the suspense and the imagery. The characters in this movie are also smart, another thing rarely found in most horror flicks. They know when they are in danger, they use the right weapons, and they don't make stupid moves, so it adds to their credibility and makes you care about them more. The modern ideas in the film are also fun to watch (electronic voyeurism, video cameras, etc.), and are a nice spin on this recycled story. It's not a gory movie either, so those expecting some sort of splatter flick will be disappointed.Shia LaBeouf plays our lead character, Kale, the troubled teenager with a serial killer for a neighbor, quite well. He's believable playing his type of character, and looks and acts like most teenagers do. Plus, despite his troubles, he's likable. The talented Carrie-Anne Moss plays his mother well, balancing authority and friendliness, and Sarah Roemer plays Kale's friendly and witty love interest. David Morse is downright scary as Mr. Turner. His expressions, mannerisms, and overall demeanor gives the audience that feeling that something isn't quite right, but it also keeps you guessing and makes things hard to pin down. All these things in the movie lead up to it's well-played (but a little bit far-fetched) finale. The film's conclusion on the romance factor did make things seem a little corny, but I couldn't let it interfere because I really enjoyed the rest of it.Overall, 'Disturbia' was a huge surprise for me. It's a PG-13 horror movie that delivers some excellent suspense and some great entertainment. It's a recycled, teenage version of a story that we have seen before, but it contains enough originality and suspense to keep things fresh. If you're a fan of thrillers or horror movies, this is a PG-13 one that is very much worth watching, don't let the rating put you off. I was so surprised at how good it was that I could hardly believe it. I really enjoyed this, and this was a big surprise to me, personally. 9/10.",9,1,4,9 August 2007
The Exorcist," Where the art of storytelling and the art of shock value meet
","'The Exorcist' revolves around a 12 year old girl named Regan (Linda Blair) and her mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn) who live in a colonial-style Washington home. Chris is an actress, and she and Regan move around a lot. Things at the new home seem to be going well - until Regan begins to act very strange. She can't sleep, her bed shakes in the middle of the night, she has bouts of body convulsions, and these symptoms progress. Her mother goes to numerous doctors to find help, and even the doctors aren't sure what's wrong with her daughter. Chris finally comes to the conclusion that Regan may be possessed by the devil himself. She then goes to her last resort, and consults a Catholic priest to perform an exorcism on her daughter. Often quoted as the scariest film of all time, 'The Exorcist', while maybe not the scariest, is surely one of the best horror movies to come across the silver screen, ever. Based on the equally shocking novel by William Peter Blatty, the script here is stunning work. Blatty also wrote the script himself, and the translation to the screen is done with precision and the result is absolute brilliance. What's most remarkable about 'The Exorcist' is its maneuvering of narrative progression with the shock value that only film could capture.The film contains a multitude of subplots; a struggling actress, a helpless mother, a Catholic priest whose faith is in limbo, and a twelve year old girl possessed by the ultimate evil. In the beginning of the film, Regan is a seemingly normal young girl with an often absent mother. But, ever so slowly, we begin to see her personality transform over the course of the film, until she has become an entirely different person, possessed, and a monster - slapping her mother, masturbating with a crucifix, uttering every curse word imaginable, vomiting green slime; the transformation is done with subtlety, but the pace at which she morphs is perfect, and the final result is tantalizing yet in-your-face. The acting is excellent, Ellen Burstyn gives a solid performance as the terrified, helpless mother who doesn't understand what's happening to her daughter. The audience sympathizes with her and is able to feel her fear and concern over the supernatural force that has grasped her daughter and won't let go. Linda Blair in the performance that defined her career (for better or for worse) is incredible as the likable little girl with a sweet and innocent face. Blair manages to evoke this innocence with ease, but what she manages to do even better is envision her possession of an unspeakable evil. She conveys the vile, evil nature of her possessed character, and is, in a way, a monster. Max von Sydow plays Father Merrin, and is excellent, as is Jason Miller as the 'looks like a boxer' Father Karras. All the acting here is solid, I can't think of anything that was in need of work - the cast is perfect.Friedkin utilizes a plethora of Catholic imagery and various symbolism throughout the film that add to the overall creepiness of the movie, and the religious message that is behind it all. I watched this when I was thirteen, and it scared the living hell out of me (literally). Watching a sweet-faced little girl go from normal human being into a foul-mouthed, disgusting 'thing' is disturbing on so many levels. The special effects were extravagant for the time, and most of them still hold up well to this day. And the final scene between Regan and Father Karass is an absolute cinematic landmark— the culmination of a precise weaving of narratives with the shocking and the macabre. 'The Exorcist' is a shocking piece of cinema. It's superbly acted, gruesome, disturbing, and flat out scary on so many occasions. It may sound clichéd, but it is without a doubt one of the greatest horror films ever made. The artful manner in which the story is presented, combined with its strong cast and perfect balance between narrative and shock value is unmatched. 10/10.",10,1,2,5 August 2004
Saw III," Relentlessly Brutal, Surprisingly Good Installment.
","I went in seeing 'Saw III' with fairly low expectations, because from what I'd seen advertised, this movie didn't look like it was going to be too great. Luckily, I was really surprised. This installment centers on Lynn (Bahar Soomekh, who starred in 'Crash'), a doctor who finds herself awaking to a horrifying situation. Turns out that Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), who is near death from a metastasized brain tumor, has chosen her to operate on him. With an elaborate device clamped on her neck (that will explode once Jigsaw's heart rate bottoms out), she is forced to perform a surgery on him to help save his life, with his assistant/previous victim, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) present. Meanwhile, another man finds himself a part of one of Jigsaw's horrible games, but this time it's up to him to save the lives of others who previously wronged him.I enjoyed the first 'Saw' film greatly, and also thought 'Saw II', while a little below-expectations, was still a very good horror film. But man, this one was really great, better than the previous sequel if you ask me. The plot is cleverly woven together to leave the viewer wondering throughout the whole movie, but it keeps your attention the whole way, and manages to be enthralling and consistently interesting. The character development was excellent in this film, something that I think the previous sequel lacked. The characters were sympathetic, and a lot of time was spent on their own psychological torment that tied in with the horrible torture that was occurring in front of their eyes. Just for that, I think this film easily surpassed 'Saw II'. The directing was well done, and is very similar to how the previous movies were shot - lots of dark and light colors, and damp, rusty atmospheres.The violence this time around is just about as nasty as you're gonna get in an R-rated movie, those who have a weak stomach are advised to avoid this film at all costs, I was questioning whether or not the limits were pushed a little too much myself. But there is a good story to be found underneath the gore, so I think the gratuitousness is forgivable. The only thing that annoyed me about this movie was a character's decision near the end of the film - I won't give it away, but man, I saw really frustrated! Oh well, the rest of this film made up for that minor annoyance.All in all, 'Saw III' is the best sequel of this series, in my opinion at least. It was clever, unpredictable, well-acted and written, and relentlessly disturbing. For fans of this series and other relentless horror flicks, 'Saw III' is definitely a must see. 9/10.",9,2,5,3 November 2006
The Favourite," A grand guignol of self-interest and sabotage
","'The Favourite' retells the later life of Queen Anne, focusing on her relationship with her close confidant Sarah Churchill, and the arrival of Sarah's cousin, Abigail, whose presence ignites a battle of wits that tests the limits of moral decency.I've noticed the reviews of this film on IMDb seem to alternate between abject hatred and 'you Americans just wouldn't understand/don't know British history and therefore won't get it.' The fact is that, despite the film being aesthetically high-brow, it does not demand its audience have written a dissertation on 18th-century British history to comprehend or enjoy it. What the film ultimately represents is a battle of wits between two women; one, a longtime companion of the queen who has a lengthy history with her (Rachel Weisz), and the other a disgraced ex-lady-cum-social climber who will stop at nothing to fulfill her own security (Emma Stone). The triangulated narrative is as old as time, but what really sells the film is the witty writing and stellar performances from Weisz, Stone, and Olivia Colman, who portrays the queen.What I found remarkable about it, among numerous things, was that it seems to cross genres nearly undetected. At times it's wickedly humorous, at others poignant, and sometimes it's even utterly suspenseful. The stakes run high for all of the characters, and both Stone and Weisz play off of one another remarkably well. Colman is also alternately endearing and petulant in her portrayal of Anne, who is in the center of the mess. All of this is punctuated by a phenomenal musical score that alternates between lush and baroque, and something so nervy it sounds as though it belongs in a horror film. The cinematography is incredible, and the costumes and setting is truly something to behold.I think the only real downfall to the film is its ending, which feels outwardly unresolved, though it thematically makes sense in regard to Abigail's character arc--does she not end where she began? All in all a very well-plotted film that works as a historical drama as well as it does an off-kilter, Machiavellian display of feminine grand guignol. 9/10.",9,4,11,13 January 2019
It Follows," A modern American classic
","Yeah, I know that sounds lofty, but that's the impression this film left on me, and I believe has on many others as well. It's been a long time since I've left the theater after seeing a horror film feeling truly roused, and 'It Follows' exceeded my wildest expectations.The narrative here is fairly straightforward: A young college student, Jay (Maika Monroe) goes on a date with a guy. On their second outing together, the two have consensual sex in his car; all is well and normal, until he inexplicably chloroforms her. She awakens tied to a wheelchair in an abandoned building, and is warned in detail by her suitor that she's been bestowed a threatening supernatural entity that will follow her until making its fatal strike— the only way out is if she 'passes it on' by having sex with someone else. Is it a parable of female sexuality? A commentary on millennial sex culture? A veiled warning on the dangers of unprotected sex? I frankly don't know, and I don't think that's really the point here. While the topic of sex is a plot hinge, the real meat of this film is in its execution of concept. Newcomer David Robert Mitchell wrote and directed the film, and has essentially taken a basic concept and fleshed it out into a feature length exercise in disquietude. The reality of this film is that there is not much to the skeleton of it; it is heavy on concept and borderline emaciated on narrative, but not to its own detriment. The main reason the film works so well is because it operates on the universal fear that humans have of being followed— on the street, in our classrooms, in the grocery store, even in our own home. The fear of being followed and not knowing why or who is after you is terrifying on every conceivable level, and Mitchell's playful striking of this very nerve is what this film is all about.This incessant terror creeps in through a series of unsettling and sometimes downright scary confrontations with the nebulous 'it', which manifests as different people. Sometimes it's strangers, sometimes people the afflicted victim knows; in either case it is inescapable, and the film closes in on the world of its characters to claustrophobic effect.The photography here is another large part of the ambiance in the film, with the camera capturing expansive views of a dilapidating Detroit, and the sleepy lives of young adults living on the suburban outskirts of it. The ambiguity of the time period is hand-in-hand with the general ambiguity of the film itself; the camera-work is sophisticated and even at times lyrical, presenting beautiful compositions and chilling run-ins with the various manifestations of 'it', whether it be lurking in corners or slowly approaching the camera from distant landscapes. The scope is undoubtedly reminiscent of John Carpenter, which has been mentioned time and again, and while the film playfully references several other genre films, it does so without being obnoxious. Underlying all of this is a pulsing synth score that is jarring yet appropriate, and is perhaps the film's most ostentatious 'throwback' element. Regardless, it works.Skilled performances are the icing on the cake here, and make it all the more believable in all the unbelievability; Maika Monroe and Keir Gilchrist lead the cast, both turning in admirable and realistic performances, and the supporting cast members are equally believable. It's a rare instance in which I felt like the filmic representation of young adult ennui was on-par. These characters and their relationships toward one another look and feel very real. While some have decried the film's showdown finale and conclusion, I didn't think there was really any better way to end a film like this. In a film whose core is so indefinite, all bets are off as far as I'm concerned, and maybe that's part of what makes the film so quietly scary— the threat lacks definition. The only conclusive attribute 'it' has is that it follows you, and through a skillful amalgamation of atmospheric camera-work, evocative mood-setting, and strong performances, that is more than enough. Check your inhibitions at the door, and this film will follow you for days. 10/10.",10,73,153,27 March 2015
Gone Girl," A Hitchcockian thriller of postmillennial proportions
","'Gone Girl' has Ben Affleck as a man who becomes the central suspect in his beautiful Ivy League wife's ghastly disappearance from their upscale Missouri home. What happened to Amy Dunne? If you've read Gillian Flynn's book or have seen the film, then you already know the story, but I'll spare the details just for the sake of spoilers.David Fincher has a penchant for making films that are stylistically rich, masterful in many ways, though not always exactly thematically profound. 'Gone Girl' falls somewhere in-between, heavy on visual slickness with some profoundly interesting ruminations on marriage, celebrity, social status, and the all-seeing spotlight of 21st century media bleeding into our lives at the most inconvenient and horrific of moments. These are obviously transferred from Flynn's novel, but Fincher's treatment of the material is apt and his vision is stunning.The sinister quiet of suburbia echoes throughout the film's open spaces, and an unusually haunting aesthetic is carried with it. The million dollar house tainted only by the smallest speck of blood; a wife who may or may not be in a danger; curbs alight with news vans and paparazzi. The universal hysteria and obsession we have with murder and crime is fully realized here, and the nightmarish situation is brought to life in a way I've never seen on film before. Flashy modernist photography accentuates thematic elements while juxtaposing with the film's more classic narrative roots, and to great effect.Needless to say, the performances here are incredible. Even as someone who is not a Ben Affleck fan, I found his performance to be truly admirable, walking the line between innocent small- town guy to deserved hex object. It wasn't until halfway through the film that I realized just how nuanced Rosamund Pike's performance was— she is so good that I was fooled by her banality, and the role becomes almost metonymic as the film unravels her throughout its narrative. Carrie Coon is wonderful as Affleck's spunky and supportive sister, and Tyler Perry and Neil Patrick Harris somehow work here despite my skepticism of their casting. The film eventually unveils its absurdist thriller roots about midway through, and unfolds in a way that is Hitchcockian in both style and substance, with shades of 'Vertigo' bleeding into the frames. The film's conclusion is of similar Hitchcockian proportions— unbelievable and yet wholly tangible. No matter how absurd it may seem to be, we do not question it because we really aren't allowed to.Overall, 'Gone Girl' is a solid thriller through and through, and is one of the best movie-going experiences I've had in recent memory. Like all the greats, its narrative has all the appropriate twists and turns and is consistently engaging, but rather than simply doing that and taking the route of imitation lone, it's very aware of and engages with its sociohistorical locus. 9/10.",9,37,75,3 October 2014
Get Out," Attack of the killer WASPs
","'Get Out' follows a young black man who heads to his white girlfriend's parents' home in an upscale bedroom community. Things are a bit off from the beginning, but they become progressively weirder—and worse—as his visit unwinds.Decried by the political right as 'racist' and touted as a racial-political masterpiece by the left, it seems to me that most people are forgetting that, at the end of the day, 'Get Out' is a horror film, and it earns its thrills amicably. Of course there are racial politics being commented on here—at times far too heavy-handedly so—but one has to remember that Peele's script is an exaggerated distortion as commentary on the current social climate around race as a topic; it's hyperbole at its finest.As a horror film, 'Get Out' is successful because it manages to generate tension and push buttons in all the right places. It plays to audience expectations just about as much as it doesn't, so there is both intrigue and the expected catharsis these films are known for delivered equal measure. Peele wears his influences on his sleeve here, with 'The Stepford Wives' (novel and film) being a chief template, even down to the film's primly manicured lawns in what is ostensibly anywhere, Connecticut, USA. The off-kilter atmosphere is strengthened by astute performances from all involved: Daniel Kaluuya is a sympathetic lead, and Allison Williams, though I found her profoundly annoying in the first two acts, plays the finale much better. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford play the white liberal country clubbers who voted for Obama to a t, but sublimate a perceptible weirdness that adds to the tension (especially Keener). The performances from Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel are also noteworthy in their utter weirdness, marked by odd expressions, movements, and gestures that throw the audience off over and over again. I did find the final act and reveal, as fun as it is, a bit routine; it's remarkably playful and has some clever shifts, but at the same time, it's nothing we haven't seen before—that said, it is nonetheless nicely played.In the end, 'Get Out' is a legitimately fun, atmospheric, and suspenseful offering. A large part of what allows the film to surprise its audience is its core commentary and observations on race, and what Peele has in essence done is inject that into a tried-and-true genre setup. It's wryly political as much as it is committed to maintaining its horror prerequisites. 7/10.",7,12,23,17 November 2017
Insidious," Something borrowed, something new.
","'Insidious' follows a young couple, Josh and Renai (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne). The couple have two sons and an infant daughter, and have just moved into a new house. Renai doesn't feel comfortable there and later has several experiences with a man appearing in her daughter's room and outside her bedroom window. The couple's eldest son, Dalton, then mysteriously falls into a coma which the doctors cannot explain. After the supernatural incidents become increasingly frightening, the couple move into a new house— and it follows. They find a medium named Elise (Lin Shaye) through Josh's mother (Barbara Hershey), who tells them that their comatose son is the reason for the paranormal activity, and that he has become a vessel for the dead who reside in a dimension she calls 'the Further'. What ensues is a struggle to retrieve Dalton's astral body and return it to his physical one.James Wan and Leigh Whannell hit it out of the park with their smash hit 'Saw', which has turned into one of the biggest horror franchises in history (with less-than-stellar sequels, if you ask me). They followed up with the underrated puppeteer horrorfest 'Dead Silence', and here they take a turn at a good, old-fashioned ghost story that's anything but old-fashioned. The film toys with classic concepts of ghostly women in black, demons, possession, and alternate dimensions, but is perhaps the first film to deal with the concept of astral projection — that is, the ability of the soul to leave the body during sleep and enter alternate planes of existence. It's a concept widely discussed by psychics and mediums, but this is probably the firs time it's ever been dealt with on film.In other regards, the film borrows ideas from many others; in some instances, it feels like a 21st century 'Poltergeist' with elements of 'The Amityville Horror', and the score is eerily reminiscent of that in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'. But in spite of the draws the film makes from other classics of its genre, it very much feels like its own movie.Visually speaking, I have to say that the film stands out the most in this arena. The ghosts are presented in a lifelike manner, and the characters featured in the Further have a Gothic, mannequin look to them. The visuals are startling and the appearances of the ghosts are disturbing and surprisingly realistic. The sets have a stolid sensibility to them, with pallid and dreary colors that add to a sense of dread that is felt throughout the film. The menacing demon that is the pinnacle of the supernatural activity is visually simple, but for that reason alone he is even scarier. The acting is all-around respectable, with Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne leading the film, and the presence of classic actresses Barbara Hershey and the quirky Lin Shaye lend the film even more credibility. Writer Leigh Whannell also surprised me, playing a nerdy paranormal investigator quite well. The film's ending was expected on my part, but by all means, it worked. Standout moments: the séance scene, the ghosts in the Further, and the woman in black.Overall, 'Insidious' borrows a lot but also makes its borrowings very much its own. The story has some fascinating elements and contains some genuinely frightening moments. The visuals alone are dazzling and surrealistic, and for that alone I'd say this film is worth a watch. With all of its elements put together, it feels 'off' in a way, but one has to wonder if it is supposed to. If anything, it's a respectable and interesting effort in a genre that is slowly becoming anything but interesting. 7/10.",7,0,0,22 September 2011
The Mist," Incredibly Tense Horror, With An Underlying Examination Of Human Nature.
","'The Mist', based on a short story by Stephen King, focuses on David Drayton (Thomas Jane), an artist who lives in a small seaside Maine town with his wife and son. After a severe storm passes, David and his son go to the local grocery store to get a few things while waiting for help. Also in the store is David's neighbor, Brent (Andre Braugher), whom he has a personal conflict with; Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden), a religious extremist known for being a bit loony; Amanda Dumfries (Laurie Holden), a friendly town resident; and countless others. When one of the town locals comes screaming in the grocery store about 'something in the mist', everyone watches in awe as a thick mist envelopes the store - a mist that carries deadly creatures with it. Trapped inside the small grocery mart in what seems to be an apocalyptic disaster, the large group of residents begin a struggle to survive the otherworldy creatures invading-- as well as survive each other.One of the best horror films to come this year, 'The Mist' is a dark and frightening story that was translated very nicely to the screen from Stephen King's original short novella. It differs from the story in places, but it sticks with the main themes. I went into this film with fairly moderate expectations, and luckily I was blown away. I typically don't go for 'creature features' - I find them to be completely unrealistic and often quite corny. However, I felt that the creatures presented in this film, while they are monstrous and alien-like, are scary. They aren't over-done, and are presented in a manner in which they are actually frightening, unlike some obnoxious CGI creations that I've seen before in other films.The film begins rather quickly, and as soon as the grocery store setting is introduced, the terror kicks in. After the mist arrives and we become aware of the monstrous creatures lurking outside, the film turns into somewhat of a character study interlaced with science-fiction/apocalyptic horror, and the combination works out perfectly. As the will to survive takes hold of each of the many people trapped together in the grocery store, they resort to desperate measures to save themselves. William Golding's literature classic 'Lord of the Flies' immediately entered my mind while watching this, especially with the religious zealot character, Mrs. Carmody, who preaches and persuades, gaining a group of weakened followers in her fanatical beliefs. This results in a stand off between Mrs. Carmody and her followers, and the more logical characters who are searching for ways to survive. The dynamic between the characters in the film is extraordinary, and the hysteria and desperation are deep themes for a horror film.Acting here is top-notch, and the cast has their work cut out for them, all playing characters pushed to the point of desperation. Thomas Jane leads the cast as our main character, a brave and protective father. Laurie Holden is excellent as the good-hearted, idealistic Amanda, and Marcia Gay Harden gives a powerful performance as the crazed Mrs. Carmody- I wanted to literally punch the woman in the face throughout the whole film, so that tells me that the collaboration of the writing and Harden's performance were doing something right. Andre Braugher (who starred in the 2004 mini-series of King's ''Salem's Lot') is also good as David's strong-willed neighbor. As for the film's ending - it's not ambiguous like the story's was, but I'm not sure if it was a good or bad thing. Tragic, yes, it's that for sure, as well as shocking and upsetting- but I cannot decide what my stand on it is. I suppose it's fitting, and it was cleverly written, but may be too much for some to take.Overall, 'The Mist' is a powerful science-fiction thriller that most genre fans will likely enjoy. It's a tense, frightening, and claustrophobic creature-feature/horror movie - but underneath all of that, it's also an examination of the human condition when put under terrifying situations, and what group hysteria and desperation can lead people to do. All around well-acted, well-directed, and highly engrossing. The end may be a little controversial, but it was tragically and painfully clever. It's a horror movie that you won't want to miss, and it ranks as one of the best so far this year. 9/10.",9,5,16,21 November 2007
Ex Machina," Sci-fi with a pulse
","'Ex Machina' has young computer programmer Caleb invited to the remote estate of a genius search engine mogul, Nathan, who has created a full-bodied artificial intelligence in the form of a young woman. There, Caleb is put through a series of interactive tests with the A.I., named Ava, though Nathan's intentions are duly called into question.Like the bulk of contemporary science fiction, 'Ex Machina' tackles the bridge between humanity and machinery and spins the ever-evolving question of what actually constitutes life, and although neither of these concepts are particularly new to cinema (especially sci- fi), director Alex Garland's presentation of the material truly makes the film stand out from its peers.The pacing is the real heartbeat of the film, progressing with a steady rhythm that allows subtleties to creep in over time. There is a definite meditative nature about the film, with the cold interiors of Nathan's postmodern mansion and Ava's elaborate machinery starkly contrasted with the overwhelming exterior photography of rolling mountains and glacial landscapes. The interior shots and camera-work evoke Stanley Kubrick and 'The Stepford Wives' in equal spades, being both visually appealing and quietly uneasy. Domhnall Gleeson leads the film as the naive, analytical programmer, while Oscar Isaac is a one-man show as his counterpart— a tortured and sardonic mathematical genius at the helm of the scientific development. Alicia Vikander embodies the enigmatic as well as the robotic, and finds a fine balance between them. The disturbing conclusion to the film ties its philosophical message into a packaged whole without being overt or preachy. Overall, I found 'Ex Machina' to be very well-crafted. I am not one who usually enjoys science fiction on the whole, but 'Ex Machina' is not exactly your standard sci-fi film either. It's very quiet, very dialogue-driven, but the atmospheric qualities that come with its visuals and thematics make for an eloquent and well-thought semi-thriller. 8/10.",8,0,6,30 April 2015
Evil Dead," Closer to the original material than people are willing to admit
","I'm a moderate fan of the original film, and went into this with fairly elevated expectations due to the stellar trailers and advertisements. While it didn't quite live up to my expectations, I can't exactly complain about it either. This 2013 re-telling has Mia (Jane Levy) going up to the family cabin with her brother (Shiloh Fernandez), his girlfriend (Elizabeth Blackmore), and friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), in an attempt to detox and rid herself of her life-threatening heroin addiction. After coming across the remnants of some sort of ritual in the basement, they discover a skin-bound book full of illustrations and incantations. Eric, an English teacher, makes a wrong move by decoding them, and unleashing a terrible evil in the woods.Fans of the original film are predisposed to hating this simply because it's a slick high- budget remake to Raimi's original punk filmmaking classic, but director Fede Alverez re- interprets the framework of the original film and ties things together in an unexpected bloodbath.While there is an apparent lack of suspense, it's worth noting that the original film didn't particularly care for that tenet either. In many ways, this remake is closer to the original film that people would like to think, at least in terms of characters and logistics— as I mentioned, suspense takes backseat; the characters in this film aren't terribly realized (and they weren't in Raimi's film either, I don't care what you say); not much is explicated as to what the 'book of the dead' really is; and, as with the original, it turns into little more than an absolute gorefest about halfway through. The main differences in this remake involve some character tweaking and variation of events when the group begins to be taken over by the demons. We still get admirable re-imaginings of classic scenes, which is always welcome.I'd also like to applaud the actors in the film; all of them turn in solid performances, but Jane Levy and Lou Taylor Pucci really shine here. Levy, relatively a newcomer, has some surprising turns when going from ill drug addict to demonic monster, and Lou Taylor Pucci is believable and likable as the smart guy who takes a significant beating. I was particularly surprised by both of their performances.I also have to give huge props to the special effects in the film, which were reportedly entirely done without CGI; assuming this was true, they pulled off quite a feat. The violence in this film looks shockingly real, and what is shown on screen is completely unrestrained. People who like gross-out horror will get plenty here.Overall, this was a fun cinema experience for me. People will endlessly discuss the film's shortcomings in relation to Raimi's original film, but I really think the truth is that this remake has more in common with the original than hardcore fans are willing to admit. 1981's 'Evil Dead' was not a bloodless suspense film, nor was it a character study or a measured thriller— it was an obnoxious, gory, devilish romp, and this remake is a 21st century rendition of that exact formula. 7/10.",7,9,65,5 April 2013
The Evil Dead," Low Budget, Campy, But Severely Impressive.
","'The Evil Dead' has been hailed a horror classic for many years now, and I can understand the hype behind this gruesome little low-budget shocker. The story is rather simple: a group of five friends are driving up to a secluded mountain cabin to spend a few days. They arrive at the old, rundown little cabin in the middle of nowhere, and while investigating around the property, they find a creepy book with a tape player in the cellar. The kids decide to play the tape around the fire, and unknowingly, they release an evil force. Soon after, the friends begin to become possessed by an evil entity that turns them into grim, deadly zombies. As each of the friends begin to turn into the horrible monsters, Ash (Bruce Campbell) is the only one left, and must fight against his friends-gone-zombies. Can he survive the night? While this movie has a large amount of flaws, its unique originality make it so rewarding. There's continuity errors all over this movie. We see the tubes used to spew blood from the zombies, things change in-between shots, and you can obviously see that the moon in the background of some shots is clearly a matted image. So, what gives? This movie is still an excellent piece of horror despite all of the errors. It's amateurish, yet it's not. Had the filmmakers had more resources, this movie would've been perfect in nearly every way. But I think the low-budget feel that this movie has is part of its campy charm. The budget on the film somehow manages to not bring down the movie in the least. The camera-work in this movie is highly impressive, and I can understand why Sam Raimi became such a big director. He knows how to make a movie, and does it well and with style.The acting in this film, like everything else, isn't perfect. It's decent enough, but nothing even remotely award winning. Bruce Campbell is the lead character, and is likable and has the audience rooting for him throughout the movie. The special effects in this movie are sometimes laughable but oh-so-messy. The blood and makeup effects are really corny looking, but despite that this movie is unbelievable violent. I can see why it was given an NC-17 rating. Even though the violence may not be entirely realistic, it's pretty nasty stuff. The atmosphere and setting in the movie is perfect - the secluded cabin in the woods is a perfect backdrop for the story, where almost everything in the movie takes place. I really liked the cabin setting, it was claustrophobic and worked greatly in the film's favor.Overall, 'The Evil Dead' is campy, violent, and often funny in some respects, but it remains an important film in the horror genre because of its originality and craftiness. Its campy and unbelievable violence is a treat for horror fans, and even if that's not your cup of tea, the movie offers a handful of genuinely frightening visuals and situations. While it may be amateurish, it's also very atmospheric and unique, and just for that, it is a deserved classic. 9/10.",9,2,5,11 November 2006
Saw II," Worthy Sequel.
","'Saw II' begins with another poor victim of the relentless Jigsaw serial killer (Tobin Bell), who is part of another 'death trap' that will squash his head like a pumpkin unless he can remove the key - from behind his eyeball. Need I say more? We then are introduced to a group of more victims placed in one of Jigsaw's horrible traps. They each awake in an old, rundown house in a sealed off room. Disoriented and confused, the helpless people don't know what to do. Then, they find a tape player that explains the deadly nerve gas they are slowly breathing in, and how they must find the antidotes that can save them. Among them is a previous victim, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), who is familiar with Jigsaw's games. It then becomes a constant battle of life or death as the unlucky people begin to turn on each other.I have to admit, this was a pretty good film for being a horror sequel. In most cases, sequels don't even come close to meeting the expectations set from the original movie, but 'Saw II' comes really close to it. The thing I liked most about this film was how there were more characters to interact with each other - there wasn't a whole lot of character development per se, but it was interesting how all of them interact and ultimately turn on each other. Just goes to show how much will some people have to save themselves, and how selfish some people are. I really liked that aspect of it. The acting wasn't bad at all, I thought everyone involved did a pretty good job, so I really have no complaints there. Good performance from Donnie Wahlberg as a cop, and Shawnee Smith as a returning victim (?) of Jigsaw. The script was clever and the ending was a little bit of a shock for me, and the film ended on a note quite similar to the original. There's plenty of violence and elaborate traps for the ill-fated characters (even more elaborate and grotesque than what the original film had featured), so gore hounds should really enjoy this stuff.Overall, 'Saw II' is a worthy sequel that comes close to meeting the standards that the first film set. It was clever (as expected), suspenseful, and cringe-inducing, as this series should be. Fans couldn't have asked for a better sequel. Not bad, not bad at all. 8/10.",8,0,1,3 November 2006
Midsommar," Leaves the audience quietly sweating in their seats
","Psychologically-fragile American college student Dani attends a celebratory midsommar festival in northern Sweden with her graduate student boyfriend, Christian, and his cohorts Josh and Mark. They are invited by Pelle, an exchange student who was raised in an isolated commune there; he explains the celebration occurs only once every ninety years. The festivities are initially harmless, but soon ramp up to disturbing proportions.Ari Aster's follow-up to 'Hereditary,' 'Midsommar' marks a significant tonal shift for the director, but it is in truth a much more aesthetically rich film. Thematically, it is less dense, but the film heaps on hallucinogenic visuals in a manner that leaves the audience feeling as intoxicated as its chemically-induced characters.When the film hits, it hits hard, and its only real downfall is that it fails to reach a true fever pitch, despite appearing to be heading in that direction. Instead, the dread slowly builds as the film plods toward its dour conclusion. Fans of the classic 'The Wicker Man' will see plenty in common with this film, and it stands as an obvious reference point for Aster. Part of the film's failure to reach a fever pitch may be due to the relatively unclear motivations of the protagonist, specifically in the final act; while it's clear why she makes the decisions she does, the emotional groundwork for them feels underserved, resulting in a finale that seems slightly shallow.Despite this downfall, Aster manages to present a lush and intoxicating film that induces dread in a manner that is oppressive and subtly terrifying, leaving the audience quietly sweating in their seats. 8/10.",8,17,38,3 July 2019
Drag Me to Hell," Raimi's Retro-Horror Ride Straight to Hell.
","'Drag Me to Hell' focuses on a young loan officer, Christine (Alison Lohman), who is yearning for a new promotion as assistant manager in her office. One morning, an elderly gypsy woman named Sylvia Ganush arrives at the office and asks Christine for a third extension on her mortgage payment. Christine, in an attempt to impress her boss and increase her chance of promotion, turns the begging old woman down - bad mistake. That evening, the woman attacks Christine in her parking garage, and places a curse on her. After contacting a psychic, Christine discovers she has been placed under a dark-spirited curse that materializes in various forms, and after three days, will take her soul to hell. To the dismay of her psychology professor boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), she goes to extremes to rid herself of the curse before time runs out.Sam Raimi, more often nowadays known for his 'Spider Man' films, debuted back in the 1980s with his low-budget cult favorite 'The Evil Dead' - a modest but gory zombie film that has gained a large following in the horror genre. Now, some twenty years later, he returns with 'Drag Me to Hell', and I can say that he won't be disappointing most of his fans. 'Drag Me to Hell' has all the makings of a classic 1970s supernatural horror movie - gypsies, curses, séances, and a handful of gooey and gross splatter scenes. While at times it is a bit over- the-top, the film manages to find a solid stance between flat out horror and outlandish 'ew' moments which border on dark humor (take for instance the iron anvil scene in the tool shed). But this is Raimi's own style, which was established from his first 'Evil Dead' film - chances are you will either like it or you won't.Visually, the audience has a lot to chew on here. The Los Angeles sets and gypsy-esquire buildings are atmospheric, and Christine's demonic encounters pop up all over the place, many of them in broad daylight, which was a nice switch-up from the typical nighttime terror scenes. I also liked the throwback feel it had, which was evident from the vintage Universal logo displayed at the beginning of the film. While it may be a high-budget Hollywood horror show set in present day, Raimi retained a sort of retro-feel to the entire thing, which was a nice nod for fans of not just his films, but for the old school horror lovers out there as well.As for the witch herself, Mrs. Ganush - wow - the filmmakers did quite the job with her. After the audience is first introduced to her, we can't help but be uncomfortable. And that discomfort turns to hiding our faces behind our hands as she terrorizes Christine during the remainder of the film. The first attack scene in the parking garage was my personal favorite; it was spooky, intense, and startling to boot. All of the scares were well-executed, and some of them were so drenched in outrageousness and body fluids that the audience can't help but scream and laugh at the same time. The film is able to take itself seriously while simultaneously not take itself seriously - which may sound like a bit of a paradox, but the formula works nonetheless.Our performers are up-to-par as well, with the lovely Alison Lohman leading the cast as our cursed protagonist. She plays the role gracefully, but is also very stern when necessary. The quirky Justin Long plays her boyfriend, who is a product of a wealthy, 'old money, Yale'-type family, who we are introduced to in a grotesque and oddly funny dinner scene with the characters of Christine and Clay. And we can't forget Lorna Raver, who plays the haggish gypsy who is the centerpiece to it all - she's mean, scary, and relentless. As far as the conclusion goes, it works in terms of the film's style. It will have some audience members gasping with their hands over their mouths, and some cheering in honor of the film's old-fashioned kick, Sam Raimi style.Overall, 'Drag Me to Hell' is a jolting, spooky horror show peppered with humor and over-the-top thrills and spills. These things alone justify the film's throwback status, giving it the feel of a 1970s-1980s grindhouse horror flick with a glossy coat of modernism. If you enjoy anything along the lines of Raimi's 'Evil Dead' to Lucio Fulci's 'The Beyond', chances are you will enjoy this movie. I believe that some audience members may not mingle well with Raimi's tongue-in-cheek horror style, but if you're willing to sit down and enjoy it for pure entertainment's sake, this is a very well-made carnival ride straight to hell. 9/10.",9,2,8,29 May 2009
Grindhouse," Truly A One Of A Kind Movie Experience.
","I'd been anticipating this movie for a long time now, and I was beyond excited when I got to see it... and I wasn't disappointed one bit. 'Grindhouse' is an adrenaline-pumping thrill machine that consists of two back-to-back full length horror movies, capturing the style of the sleazy grind house movies of the '70s. They even went as far as tying the two films together with fake movie trailers. First in line is Robert Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror', which is about a small Texas town where a bio-chemical is unleashed, transforming everyone into disgusting zombies. It's up to a go-go dancer with one leg, her ex-boyfriend, a doctor with an evil husband, and a few others to save the world. The second film is Quentin Tarantino's 'Death Proof', which follows a psychotic ex-stunt man who takes late-night joyrides, preying on young women to kill them with his 'death proof' stunt car, and two groups of girls who unfortunately cross his path.Truly one of the most unique and amazing movie-going experiences I've ever had the pleasure of encountering, 'Grindhouse' is an entertaining, explosive roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. It is hard to review this film since I am essentially reviewing two different movies, but I'll try my best. The first film, 'Planet Terror' boasts a plot line that is similar to what could be found back when true grind house movies were in, and it captures that feeling all too effectively. The film looks grainy, dirty, and shaky at times, and there are even missing reels in which a retro announcement pops on screen reading 'Missing Reel. We are sorry for the inconvenience - Theater Management' (although this does happen in both movies). 'Planet Terror' had all the elements for a good old corny B-grade zombie movie. The film starts with a bang, and doesn't quit until the very end. Disgusting zombie creatures, over-the-top violence, and some wonderful action sequences really make this one an adrenaline-pumper. I was thoroughly entertained at all times - not scared, but so very much entertained with it.'Death Proof', while much more low-key in terms of gore and action, is still an excellent film and a nice change of pace from the in-your-face nature of 'Planet Terror'. While 'Planet Terror' focused more on action and zombies, 'Death Proof' is heavy on character development, something that Tarantino fans are well aware of. Our victims (which consist of a bunch of young and talented actresses) are well fleshed-out, and we really get to know them before we see them meet their demises at the hands of the psychotic 'Stuntman Mike'. The writing in this film is great because of the dialog mostly. The conversations between the characters are what gets the audience to know them, and these conversations are interesting just because of the way they are written. I've heard complaints about this film being too 'boring' and 'slow', but I mean, really - when you compare almost any movie with 'Planet Terror', it's going to seem much slower, because compared to 'Planet Teror', it is. Nonetheless, this film boasts some engaging dialog scenes and a couple rare but rewarding car chases.Another excellent addition to this movie is it's stellar cast. 'Planet Terror' features Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Marley Shelton, Josh Brolin, Stacey Ferguson, a cameo from Bruce Willis, and others. 'Death Proof' features Kurt Russel, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and others (along with a couple of rather small performances from Rose McGowan and Marley Shelton as well). We also get a few great cameo performances from some well-known actors in the fake movie trailers in between each movie. All in all, the acting here is top-notch. I'll admit, it is a little corny at some moments and some performances were better than others. But this is supposed to be a B-style horror double feature, so I really can't complain about the acting much, can I? Overall the performances were great, I can't make a genuine complaint about any of them - I honestly liked everybody.Before ending my review, I'd like to mention the overall style of this movie for those who haven't seen it yet. Tarantino and Rodriguez were trying (and succeeded) to create a double-feature of two retro-style horror flicks in the tradition of the notorious grind house midnight double bills back in the 1970s. They succeed at this in almost every way. The stories are written to fit the style, the film looks it as well (with all of it's scratchiness and grain, along with the missing reels and the genuine retro announcements that come across the screen, advertising theater refreshments and letting us know when the feature presentation is about to begin). They really captured this feel, and it's wonderful. I'd also like to comment on the fake movie trailers placed before the films. We get a handful of corny, crude, but absolutely hilarious movie trailers advertising sleazy B-grade horror flicks. They're utterly ridiculous and downright funny, but they, like everything else in the movie, captured that retro style that it was going for.Overall, 'Grindhouse' is a double feature to die for. It is stocked full of action, thrills, violence, laughs, and some great actors. I can confidently say this is a movie experience like no other, and I mean it when I say it. We get two great films from two great directors - 'Planet Terror' and 'Death Proof' - back to back, for the price of one. What more can you ask for? I strongly recommend this for anyone who wants a good thrill-ride, or would like a very entertaining and nostalgic homage to the notorious grind house films from a time long ago. Destined to become a cult classic, and the best time I've had at the movies in years. 10/10, and that goes for both movies. (On a side note, I'd strongly recommend seeing this in theaters, the 'experience' will be largely diminished on your home television set).",10,20,40,12 April 2007
Saw," One of the Most Unique and Grisly Thrillers In Recent Memory.
","'Saw' is one of the better horror films in recent memory. I suppose it's more of a thriller than horror, although it still is gory and serves well on a horrific level. It's sort of a cross between 'Se7en' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' I'd say, and the film is pretty damn good. 'Saw' opens with two men who wake up in a dilapidated public restroom with no memory of how or why they are where they are. Chained to the floor, they are both utterly confused and terrified. Together, they begin to piece together the memory of what happened to them as the serial killer, nicknamed Jigsaw threatens them and plays numerous mind games that lead up to their demise. Meanwhile, detectives and officials are on the trail of the brutal serial murderer, trying to save the men the entire time.This is definitely a smart thriller and it will have you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning to the bloody, limb-severing conclusion. The characters are extremely believable and the acting was great, including performances by Carey Elwes, Monica Potter, and Danny Glover. Everyone performed perfectly and were very believable to watch. The entire movie has a dark, damp setting, and is overloaded with intense scenes and lots of gore, that are sure to please any horror fan. On top of that, the cleverly-woven story is unique and underived. James Wan does an excellent job, especially considering this to be his first feature film. I can't wait to see some his future stuff.Bottom line - 'Saw' is a smart, grisly, unforgiving, all-around brutal horror movie that is unique and original. If you are looking for a horror movie a notch above your average slasher flick, I advise you see 'Saw'. 9/10.",9,161,260,11 December 2004
Sinister," Horreur technologique
","In this day and age, horror is getting more and more creative by demand since the psycho killer in the woods-scenario has pretty much run its course. A consequence of that is the incorporation of contemporary technology and concepts appearing in the genre; 'found footage' films have replaced Jason and Michael, and while these films do have potential (this year's indie 'V/H/S' had some neat ideas), even they are beginning to lose steam. Enter 'Sinister', which is an amalgam of timeless supernatural horror themes and 'found footage' technique that has proved to be a consistent box office draw.'Sinister' follows a true crime author, Ellison (Ethan Hawke) who moves his family (unbeknownst to them) into a house where an entire family was hung to death in a tree in their backyard, save the youngest daughter who vanished without a trace. Upon moving in, Ellison finds a box of 8mm footage and a projector in the attic; contained in these reels of film are various murders dating from the 1960s up to present day— one of them is the filming of the hanging murder that occurred in his backyard. As he furthers investigation into the footage, he finds more than he bargained for when connections are made to an ancient deity who takes the souls of children.On a surface level, 'Sinister' appears like every other horror piece on the market, but I was surprised by the substance the film had. Conceptually and thematically speaking, it's not painfully original, but director Scott Derrickson makes up for that with striking visuals and a daunting soundtrack. The opening of the film is particularly disturbing— the movie begins with the family hanging murder, which sets a damned unsettling tone for the rest of the film.In terms of the supernatural elements at play in the script, they almost seem fairytale-ish (a Pagan deity who feeds on children— c'mon), but it does add a unique element to the film. I have to say though that the most frightening thing in this movie are the actual murder tapes themselves. It could be just me, but the notion of filmed murders unsettles me to the core, even if I know that the footage is faked; as if the act of murder itself isn't awful enough, documenting it is downright... well, sinister. The footage utilized in the film is unsettling, shocking, and above all, it's realistic, so the audience gets the same unpleasant feelings shared by Ethan Hawke's character. Truly macabre stuff.Another major positive for this film is that the acting is far above par for what most genre fans are dealt. Ethan Hawke is a quality actor and newcomer Juliet Rylance proves her chops here; their scenes together are particularly strong, and much more than any horror fan could dream of asking for. The film's ending can be seen from a certain distance, although it doesn't necessarily make it less shocking in this case. If anything, it adds to the sense of dread pervading the film.Overall, 'Sinister' was a pleasant surprise for me. It doesn't offer heaps in terms of originality, but it's a stylistically stunning film and takes steps in the right in direction very gracefully. When it comes down to it, I can't say that I was even really 'scared' by the film so much as I was unsettled by it. It has its share of orthodox jump scares, but I was more bothered and rattled by the grim nature of the film as a whole, which is a nice feeling to walk away from the theater with as a thick-skinned genre fan who has become increasingly harder to unnerve. 7/10.",7,174,242,12 October 2012
A Clockwork Orange," Utterly Original And Altogether Exhilarating.
","'A Clockwork Orange' is one of the strangest but most intriguing films I can think of. It's an altogether bizarre experience and quite 'out-there', but the work displayed here is just flat out excellent. The film centers on Alex de Large (Malcolm McDowell), a delinquent in future Britain who feeds off of sex and violence. But when he is arrested and put through a mind-changing experiment by the government, things don't all go as planned.What most would consider Kubrick's best film, 'A Clockwork Orange' is one of those movies you need to watch more than once to fully enjoy. The first viewing is the strangest because it takes awhile for the viewer to fall into the alternate reality and become accustomed to it. But once you let yourself into it, it becomes a much more interesting movie. It's a mind trip for sure, and a flawless one at that. Sometimes it's downright funny, and others it's extremely disturbing - the emotions in the movie range all across the spectrum.The dialogue and script is all pitch-perfect, the acting is stunning especially from McDowell, and the atmosphere and imagery is to die for. The set pieces and overall feel of the movie is unique, with a sort of retro '70s-gone-wild architecture. The score is amazing, mostly consisting of good old 'Ludwig Van' and mainly classical music, but the score plays along with the movie perfectly. Kubrick's camera-work is great and his overall style is unmatched - I saw many similarities between this and his later horror classic 'The Shining' while I was watching this. His style and overall tone is unique, and his vision completely original - it's not hard to see why he became one of the most beloved filmmakers of all time.Overall, 'A Clockwork Orange' is a film unlike any other. It offers a disturbing look into a fictional character's life, and everything that it revolves around is completely enthralling. Beautiful cinematography and camera-work, perfect performances, unique imagery and atmosphere, and a painfully bizarre story make this one of the all-time film classics. It's a film that is hard to describe - you sort of just have to see it for yourself, and more likely than not, you will appreciate it and enjoy it as countless others have. 10/10.",10,1,4,5 November 2007
From Hell," Compelling, Scary, And Well Told.
","'From Hell' takes place in 1888 in Victorian-era London. In the Whitechapel district of the city, prostitutes begin to be found murdered in the streets, all of them stabbed to death with their throats slashed, and their sexual (and other) organs removed. Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp), a proclaimed clairvoyant, is assigned to the case, and begins to develop a relationship with Mary Kelly (Heather Graham), a prostitute who is friends with many of the victims. As the prostitutes begin to drop like flies, clues are also dropped at each crime scene, and Abberline's visions of the killer become increasingly violent, as he attempts to unravel the identity of the murderer.A truly chilling and well-made film, 'From Hell' is a semi-fictional telling of the real-life murders that occurred in London at the turn of the 19th century. The killer referred to himself Jack The Ripper, and while his identity was never revealed, his crimes go down as likely the most infamous serial killing of all time. The script for this movie, adapted from a graphic novel, quite obviously differs from the real historical facts, but it doesn't get too far off track, which is good. Many of the characters actually existed, and some of the events are told like they happened. The pacing here is great as well, and though most modern audiences may find this movie too 'slow' or 'boring', the pacing is even, balancing the progression of the story and the shocks well. The movie builds a heap of suspense as it progresses, and the final revelation is satisfying. It's quite a visceral little movie as well, and while most of the violence isn't really seen, it's still quite a gory movie, which I wasn't expecting. The depictions of the murders themselves were particularly disturbing, but also done in a shocking and original manner.Johnny Depp plays our hero, Inspector Abberline, and nails the role perfectly. His authority and intelligence emanates on screen, and he plays the role very believably (although his English accent may be a little off, I won't nitpick though). Heather Graham turns in a great performance as well, even though she's playing the clichéd 'hooker with a heart of gold' who finds herself and her friends in a very scary situation. Another thing that should be noted about this movie is it's amazing set design and cinematography - the gritty, lamp-lit cobblestone streets of downtown London are presented perfectly here, and the atmosphere is very Gothic and quite spooky. There is also quite a few great visuals (some of them a bit hallucinogenic, but very interesting), as well as some very clever and well-executed camera tricks. The entire picture really looks stunning. The ending was a bit of a downer, but I really didn't have a problem with that either.All things considered, 'From Hell' is an exceptional horror/thriller that is stylish, very well told, and quite scary. If the Jack The Ripper case is of any interest to you, or if you are just a fan of horror movies (particularly period pieces), I'd advise you to take a look at this movie, because it is an excellent and entertaining (albeit somewhat fictionalized) telling of those infamous crimes. 9/10.",9,2,5,10 July 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Oh, 'Salo'
","Decried, lauded, and branded the most repulsive film of all time, it's difficult to even talk about 'Salo.' What is there to say that hasn't been said? Pasolini's final film has a group of libertines and accomplice prostitutes rounding up teenage boys and girls like cattle, and subjecting them to sexual, mental, and physical torture in WWII-Italy before systematically butchering them. Sounds like a good time, no?In spite of is graphic content, I am in the camp of people who appreciate this film for its visuals and thematic content. While there is an argument to be made that 'Salo' is tasteless, it's difficult to say it's artless; the film is loaded with gorgeous compositions and set pieces that look like Italian Renaissance paintings. And perhaps it's the beauty of so much of the film that makes its other content so disturbing. The violence in the film is abhorrent, depicted and played by the actors with a plainness that registers as uncomfortably authentic. They are psychologically toyed with, raped and sexualized, and ultimately mutilated. Pasolini remarked his intentions to show the 'anarchy of power' with the film, and the display is honest. The graphic brutalization, from the coprophilia and to the sexual violence, is thick with metaphor; simultaneously, it's also representative of reality to some degree, and that's probably why so many turn away. It's not pleasant to watch, chiefly because it's morally corrupt and physically repulsive, but also because it demonstrates a nasty truth: That there is a monster in all of us.I don't believe 'Salo' is the frivolous exploitation as some have deemed it, although it is unquestionably a progenitor of today's 'torture porn.' It's natural to have an averse reaction to this film, but that's part of the point; and as pretentious as one can argue that that is, it's also a singular stroke of genius in a way, almost Warholian. The unique thing about 'Salo' is that it is as much metaphor as it is realization, and interwoven within is poetry, both visual and literate. Pasolini's admitted chief aim here was to criticize the unchecked powers of fascism, the byproduct of which is unchecked violence, so I find it hard to believe that the film in any way celebrates physical horrors so much as it throws them on the altar. Humanity can be unspeakable—make of it what you will.",10,4,11,10 June 2009
Don't Breathe," Relatively minimalist but high-octane thriller
","'Don't Breathe' follows a trio of delinquents who plan to rob a wealthy blind man whose house sits alone in an abandoned, derelict Detroit neighborhood. What seems like a relatively easy heist turns progressively worse as the young adults find the tables turned on them.In a decade that has offered little in terms of high(ish)-caliber horror-thrillers, 'Don't Breathe' stands out, not necessarily as an exemplar of excellence, but at least as an example of a hard-edged thriller that is head and shoulders above the majority of its peers. Fede Alvarez, who gave us the divisive 2013 'Evil Dead' remake (a film which, for what it's worth, I thought was unfairly bashed), returns as writer/director, teaming up again with Jane Levy, who also starred in the 'Evil Dead.'Conceptually speaking, 'Don't Breathe' is straightforward, almost minimalist; there is no pretense to speak of, and after a brief but sufficient exposition, the film jettisons its audience into the cat-and-mouse dilemma that dominates its remainder. Somewhat of a quasi-inversion of the home invasion film, the script allows room for moral ambiguities in spite of its conceptual and narrative straightforwardness, toying with the audience's sympathies and facing us with situations which challenge the moral compass. This is of course not to say that 'Don't Breathe' is necessarily a deep psychological thriller, because it's not—the primary focus here is maintaining suspense—but there is food for thought amid the action.Solid performances from Stephen Lang and Jane Levy help carry the narrative, with Lang as an ice-cold, disturbed veteran and Levy as a poverty-stricken young woman whose desperation jeopardizes both her and her friends' lives. The film is nicely shot and features some impressive cinematography, including a noteworthy single-take pan through the house that follows each of the three protagonists as they search for the man's stockpile of cash. I did feel that the film's final act edged into predictable exploitation territory, where shock value and redundancy came close to overriding the general tension that the first hour had done so nicely, but the final two scenes were solid enough to carry the film home.All in all, I was impressed by this film; not as a groundbreaking piece of cinema, but as a generally well-plotted, candid thriller that manages not to steer too far off course for its own good. It's not often that such a simple concept is done with so much finesse, let alone is able to keep its fuel burning. A definite standout thriller of the decade. 8/10.",8,3,8,23 September 2016
The Descent," It Doesn't Get Much Better Than This.
","I went in seeing 'The Descent' with high expectations, mainly from all of the great things I've heard about this film. And this one definitely delivered, on many different levels than one, which was refreshing to see among all of the cheap Hollywood horror that is carted out lately. The film begins in the UK with a woman named Sarah, who is river rafting with two friends, all whom seem to be pure thrill seekers. On Sarah's drive back from the river expedition with her husband, a horrible car accident takes place, taking the life of Sarah's young daughter. A year later, Sarah and a group of her friends meet in the US Appalachian mountains to prepare for a cave exploration. After spending the night in a cabin, the group of girls (lead by Juno, the thrill-seeking aficionado) head to a cave at the mouth of a river. After descending into the cavern, they are fascinated by it. But their fascination soon turns into fear, after a tunnel leading into another area of the cavern collapses, nearly killing Sarah and cutting the girls off from the exit. As the minutes tick by and their sources of light begin to lose power, the girls begin to lose hope, desperately searching for a way out. Their hopes are heightened slightly when they find evidence of previous explorers and cave markings, but it is revealed that the cave they're in isn't the cave they thought they were in. Turns out Juno took them to an unexplored cave that is unknown to anyone, so they could 'explore it for themselves', not telling her friends.After one of the girls, Holly, falls and severely injures her leg, Sarah spots a strange human-looking creature hiding in the darkness. Of course her friends don't believe her, telling her it's just the dark playing tricks. But they believe her soon enough, because the strange breed of pale, human-like creatures close in on the girls, and they are thirsty for blood. After killing one of the creatures, an examination of it leads to the conclusion that the species are completely blind, hunting their prey by only sound. Now, with limited light source, can the girls escape the cave? Or will they become another meal for the flesh-eating species? This film is a pure work of terror, probably one of the best I've seen in a very long time, managing to be extremely spooky and dodging the majority of clichés that are so prominent in horror films. The cave sequences (which most of the film consists of) are dark, damp, and extremely claustrophobic. I felt uncomfortable watching them, almost as if I was actually there. The acting was excellent, each of the women gave perfect performances. The caves themselves were very convincing, which has me wondering whether or not they used actual caverns to film the movie in. The creatures in this movie were disgusting, and their orchestrated movements and strange howl/screaming sounds were very creepy. They weren't too over the top, nothing like the giant monsters you see in films like 'The Cave'. On the contrary, they are actually very human-like, but their skin and eyes are pure white and they seem to have excellent climbing skills. Unlike in most horror films, I actually felt bad for the characters as they met grisly fates at the hands of the creatures, and I felt even worse when someone was killed accidentally by one of her friends. I won't go into the details, but it was actually quite tragic the way the whole film played out. From what I know, there are two versions of the ending, and the U.S. version is a tad bit shorter, but from what I read about the two versions it really isn't major. Let's just say that we Americans seem to enjoy 'happy endings'. I really didn't think it was a huge deal though.All in all, 'The Descent' is one scary good time. It was claustrophobic, intense, and had you not knowing what to expect next, holding your attention the whole time. It isn't your over the top, corny monster movie, so don't anticipate anything like the mediocre creature-feature 'The Cave', 'The Descent' is miles above it. Horror films don't get much better than this. 9/10.",9,4,9,5 August 2006
Psycho," Hitchock's Most Famous Film, And Probably His Best.
","'Psycho' is one of the greatest horror classics of all time. The film follows Marion Crane, played by the legendary Janet Leigh, embezzles $40,000 from her employer. She goes and buys a brand new car with the cash, and hits the road to start a new life. That night she gets caught in a really bad rainstorm in the desert, and she spots the bright lighted sign of the Bates Motel, which she decides will be her destination for now. She checks in, and the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), makes her a sandwich. He seems nice, if not a little strange. She then goes to her room, undresses, while Norman spies through a hole in the wall.She enters the bathroom, and begins taking a shower. And I'm sure most of you know what happens from there on. Anyways, Marion's sister and lover begin to worry about her disappearance and hire a detective to investigate.'Psycho' is a true classic, plain and simple, and one of the best horror films in history. The whole story (based on the book by Robert Bloch) is very interesting and the film keeps you guessing, because you never really know who Norman's mother is - the mystery shrouded around it all is effective and eerie. The infamous shower scene is now known by thousands of people, so it's kind of trademarked this series of films (although all of the sequels are awful besides 'Psycho II', which was just alright), and the editing of the scene defines the 'less is more' saying. The tricky editing used fools the audience into thinking they are seeing more than they are, and it is brilliantly done.After Marion's murder, Janet Leigh's presence is felt like a ghost throughout the rest of the film, while her sister and boyfriend try and find her. Anthony Perkins is near perfection as the kind but strange Norman Bates, he gives the character much depth and a feeling of unease. Janet Leigh is excellent as well in the role of her career as the ill-fated Marion. The film is black and white, which gives it that classic movie feel, I like old black and white movies, although you don't see very many horror ones. The pacing is excellent and the film holds interest wonderfully. The ending is a bit of shocker, and that final frame is one you won't shake easily.Ovearll, this is probably Hitchcock's best film ever. The story is great, the acting (especially by Perkins and Leigh) was pitch perfect, and the film was genuinely scary with some a heavy doses of suspense. The shower scene is classic, too - if there is one scene in all of Hollywood history that won't be forgotten, that shower murder is it. Undeniably one of the greatest horror films in history. 10/10.",10,0,1,1 June 2006
The Witch," Calvinist terrors abound in this fraught 'folk tale'
","'The Witch' charts a family of Calvinist dissenters in colonial America who are exiled from their community and homestead at the edge of an ominous forest. When the infant child of the family disappears inexplicably, a chain of increasingly bizarre events lead to claims of witchcraft and sorcery that implode the family.Based on the plot summary, much about 'The Witch' seems fairly predictable, and that's because it is. Robert Eggers makes no bones about reality or superstition here; this is, as it is branded, a 'New England folktale' through and through. It's also allegorical on some levels, and is about an English family's failure to conquer the vast American frontier. Regardless of how it is read, the film's surface plays out like classic accounts of witchcraft and superstition that pervaded Puritan Calvinism in the seventeenth century.What director Eggers does here is weave a taut and unsettling narrative through a series of meditative visuals and haunting encounters with evil--some have said not much happens in the film, and they're right--but is that the point of such a tale? The story is mediated through phenomenal performances that are the real emotional center of the film, while rare but fantastical occurrences with the supernatural jar the audience as much they do the family.Eggers' direction is remarkable, and the cinematography consistently captures the gloom of a New England winter; close-ups show the younger children engaging with their ominous farm goat, while pans of characters venturing into the woods create a legitimate sense of danger--and that is another of the film's prevailing themes. In the film, the threat of danger lurks in all matter, be it in the natural environment, in doctrine, or the horrifying corporeal locus where the two meet.Overall, 'The Witch' is a surprising and moody entry in the horror genre for 2016; it is not only recalling classicism in its period setting and narrative, but also in its cinematic approach to storytelling. It is old-fashioned in just about every way, but is no less masterful at creeping into the skin as insidiously as evil does within the family. We feel their terror, their desperation, and their yearning for absolution; and that is what makes the film such an effective mood piece. 9/10.",9,194,325,19 February 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Terrifying; a timeless, paranoid classic
","'Rosemary's Baby' centers on Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow and John Cassavettes), a young, happy couple who move into a New York City apartment building to start their life together. They are greeted by their elderly neighbors, Minnie and Roman Castevet (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer), an eccentric and friendly couple who are helpful but a bit intrusive. Rosemary and Guy plan on having a baby together, but the conception is strange and seems to have happened while Rosemary was dreaming. All the while, Minnie and Roman seem to form an unusual relationship with Guy, and begin to take over all the duties and events revolving around Rosemary's pregnancy - things that should be up to the mother. Meanwhile, Rosemary begins to lose weight, is constantly ill, and has odd pains in her stomach - things that aren't normal in a healthy pregnancy. After a series of strange events, Rosemary soon becomes convinced that Minnie and Roman are part of a Satantic cult, and that they have made some sort of exchange with Guy... a horrific exchange that involves Rosemary and her baby.Maybe one of the greatest stories of betrayal to grace the silver screen, this adaptation from Levin's phenomenal novel is done neatly and the transfer to the screen is brilliant. The film, like the book, takes its time, but the slow-going nature gives plenty of room for formidable suspense and atmosphere.One of the scariest things about 'Rosemary's Baby' is its affect on the viewer. The paranoia, fear, claustrophobia, and foreboding that Rosemary feels channels directly to the audience, and you by proxy experience what she's experiencing. The first forty-five minutes or so seem fairly conventional, but after that the film goes into a straight downward spiral into madness, and by God do you feel it. There's a consistent sense of something not being quite right, mainly with the neighbors whose motives are questionable behind their friendly facade, and this feeling never dissipates. Within the element of the betrayal are the layers of subjects that make it a horror film— the Satanic society, the occult, strange rituals, the Antichrist, and the overall demonic subtext. It's all quite terrifying, and the contents of the plot are all sinister subjects. The film looks amazing, as if it could have been shot just last week. Nice camera-work that is subtle and neat, but shaky and effective when needed. The settings are all truly spooky, and the Dakota is is photographed to its full Gothic effect.Mia Farrow stars in the performance of her career as the young, naive Rosemary. All she wants is the ideal life with her husband and child, but she is swept into something more terrifying than she could ever imagine. Farrow plays the part precisely and gains plenty of sympathy from the audience. Ruth Gordon won an Oscar for her portrayal of the Woodhouse's nosy neighbor, Minnie. She's friendly and inquisitive, but we know from the start that she has ulterior motives, as well as her husband. John Cassavettes plays Guy excellently, and Sidney Blackmer is great as well as Minnie's odd husband. As for the ending, it's a shocker, and probably the most memorable thing about the entire movie. It's something that will stick with you and that you can't easily shake, but is ambiguous enough to keep you asking questions.Overall, 'Rosemary's Baby' is a through-and-through classic. While it isn't 'scary' by conventional means, it manages to maintain a subtle, foreboding atmosphere, unnerving the audience to the point of paranoia. The performances are top-notch, and the subject matter is as shuddering as the Castevet's dark, evil intrusion into Rosemary's life. You'll spend an uncomfortable but spellbinding two hours on the edge of your seat. Isn't that what a good horror movie should do? 10/10.",10,20,27,30 August 2007
30 Days of Night," Excellent Vampire Film, and One of the Best Horror Movies of the Year.
","'30 Days Of Night' centers on the small, rural Alaskan town of Barrow. Each year, the 'city at the top of world' is plunged into one month of darkness, void of any sunlight. Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett), the town sheriff, looks over the snow-covered, close-knit community. On the last day of sunlight, a stranger (Ben Foster) arrives in town, babbling about the darkness and what is yet to come. Eben and his estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George), also a law-enforcer, think nothing of the man's rantings. But when a group of vampires arrive in town, with a thirty day feast ahead of them, it seems this stranger knows more than they assumed. As the vampires suck the life out of everyone in the town, Eben, Stella, and a group of others are the only ones left alive... but can they survive the next thirty days before they become victims of the blood-drinking creatures? Based on the graphic novel, '30 Days Of Night' is likely one of the scariest and best horror movies to come out this year. Most horror fans know that the horror genre hasn't seen a genuinely good vampire film in quite some time. I can't think of one in the past ten years that has been anything above average. But, if you've been waiting for a good vampire movie, you've got it right here. The most impressive thing about this film to me was the construction of the setting for the film, and the catch to it all - the fact that there is no sunlight for thirty days, which basically gives vampires an endless smörgåsbord. And while the credit for this does go to the writer of the graphic novel, this film was very well made, and managed to stay fairly unpredictable and consistently suspenseful.It begins fairly steady, but when the night begins to fall and the thirty days of darkness arrives, things begin to kick and the story is wound tight with plenty of tensity. The atmosphere was very good, the isolated setting worked perfectly and the extremely cold, snowy backdrop is an unusual but chilling setting for this type of film. The jolts are well-executed and the suspense factor is high. David Slade, who directed the magnificent thriller 'Hard Candy', directs this film as well, and I thought he did a great job here. The cinematography was excellent and there are some really great shots in this film, among them being a breathtaking birds-eye view of the town as it's being ransacked by the vampires, who have left large pools of red snow throughout the streets. The vampires themselves are grotesque and downright scary looking, and are nearly half creature-like. Not only that, but they also have their own language, which is translated with subtitles.Each of our characters are fairly well written, too, and all of them were very well acted. Josh Harntett leads the cast as the film's hero whose job is to take care of everyone else. He's convincing in the action scenes and with emotion, and does a great job. Melissa George plays his estranged wife in somewhat of a tough-girl role, and she's excellent as well. Rounding out the cast is Ben Foster, who really surprised me in his performance as the filthy drifter who has a connection with the vampires, Mark Rendall playing Hartnett's teenage brother, and Danny Huston as Marlow, the leader of the bloodsuckers. I thought the ending was brilliant and very unpredictable and unexpected.Overall, '30 Days Of Night' is an exceptional recent entry into the vampire sub-genre, and it provides one frightening ride that is worth the price of theater admission. It has an original story, some great scares, and stunning cinematography to boot. It isn't your usual vampire movie, and for fans of vampire flicks, it will be a refreshing and scary experience. Well worth seeing, especially during the Halloween season. I can say it's one of the best horror movies of the year thus far. 9/10.",9,3,9,21 October 2007
Scream 2," Not As Amazing As The First, But Still Good.
","'Scream 2' picks up from where 'Scream' left off, with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is still dealing with memories of the murder spree that she survived in her hometown of Woodsboro during her senior year of high school. But Sidney is off to college now, and things are beginning to look up. She has a good best friend, Hallie (Elise Neal), and a love interest, Derek (Jerry O'Connell). But after a murder that occurred in a cinema (that was incidentally showing a movie based upon the murder spree that Sidney survived), the memories flood back, and another masked killer in the same attire begins to murder those around Sidney - but who is it behind the mask? A follow-up to Wes Craven's 1996 horror hit, 'Scream', this slasher sequel is a guaranteed good time. Kevin Williamson returns to write the script for this film as well, and crafts a fairly solid story to continue the series with. The opening of this movie (the cleverly-executed cinema murder) was fabulous, and is probably the most memorable thing about this movie. There is some tongue-in-cheek humor to be found as well, but nothing over the top - this film remains fairly serious despite it's poking at the horror genre rules, which is something the original did quite well. I have to give Mr. Craven and Mr. Williamson some credit for their clever handling of these films, because they really are well-done horror movies.Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy return from the original, all giving good performances. Some new additions to the cast are Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Sarah Michelle Gellar (who starred in 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' the same year), to name a few. The acting is on-par for the most part, and I liked the casting. The atmosphere in this film is much different than the small-town feel the original had, which I personally preferred - then again, you can't have a movie like this take place in the same town for a second time. There are plenty of surprise moments as well (and some clichéd jump-scares), but the conclusion was probably the biggest surprise of all. I never saw it coming, and I don't think most people would because the writing was so well done. Overall, 'Scream 2' is a worthy sequel to a groundbreaking horror movie. Did I like it better than the first? No way, I prefer the original, but that doesn't mean it was bad at all. It was entertaining, spooky, and had enough twists and turns to keep nearly anyone's interest. 'Scream' fans will be surely pleased with it. And as far as horror sequels go, this film ranks pretty high. 7/10.",7,3,4,9 June 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Sensual, Artistic, And Horrific Telling Of Stoker's Classic Tale.
","'Dracula' begins with Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), who makes a visit to a Transylvanian castle that homes Count Dracula (Gary Oldman). Count Dracula, who is a blood-drinking king of the undead, takes a liking to Harker's fiancé, Mina Murray (Winona Ryder), who is living back in London. But when Dracula makes his way to the foreign land, many strange things begin to happen. Lucy (Sadie Frost), Mina's childhood friend, is struck ill after having a horrific incident that left her with two puncture wounds on the neck. Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) comes to investigate the strange happenings, and comes to the realization that Dracula is near... and will stop at nothing to pursue Mina, because they have some sort of connection - one from beyond the grave.Francis Ford Coppola's 'Dracula', based on the all-time classic novel by Bram Stoker, is an enthralling and consistently eerie film with many artistic qualities. One of the main things about this film that stands out is its stunning cinematography and its Gothic and grotesque imagery. Coppola has taken the classic horror tale and brought it to the screen as pure eye candy- the entire movie is really a visual treat. Surreal settings, vivid use of colors, and violent imagery blended with sexuality all make it a bizarre and fantastic experience. To my surprise, even, it was a fairly bloody rendition of the tale, but not too over the top. There are some very frightening scenes and a handful that will stick in your mind. Also notable is the special effects work that was done on the movie. The Dracula character goes through many different transformations throughout the story, from an old-aged man, to a young one, and to a vampire beast. Great work in the special effects there, I was surprised at how well done it was. But, we really have to give credit to Oldman himself, who likely out-does Bela Lugosi's Dracula, with his seductive, frightening performance. He has been praised by many for his performance here, and deservedly so. Winona Ryder, although I couldn't picture her in the role at first, plays Mina excellently. The supporting cast includes Anthony Hopkins (right after his award-winning performance in 'The Silence of the Lambs') as Van Helsing, Keanu Reeves as Jonathan (who wasn't great here, passable, but I've never thought he was an impressive actor to begin with), Cary Elwes as Lord Arthur, and Sadie Frost as Lucy. The cast was overall very strong, and it was neat to see some of the actors playing characters from the Victorian era. I admired this movie as well for staying fairly true to Stoker's novel, everything was adapted well.Overall, Coppola's 'Dracula' is probably the best film telling out there. If there's a better one, I sure haven't seen it. If you know the story well, you won't be displeased. The cinematography and visuals are enough to deem this film as a must-see at least once, but all things considered, this is an artistic, frightening, fantastic movie. Excellent from beginning to end, and probably the best vampire film that I've ever seen. Highly recommended based on its excellent script and truly stunning visuals, you won't be disappointed. 9/10.",9,1,2,6 October 2007
The Conjuring," Things go a'bump in the night; old school ho-hum
","'The Conjuring' has Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, the famed demonologists and paranormal investigators who have had terribly polarizing careers. This film focuses on their dealing of a case in 1971 in which a family is terrorized by evil forces in their Rhode Island farmhouse. What can I say? The teaser trailer for this film hooked me. It was nerve-wracking and different. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't entirely pan out that way— but before you get ahead of yourself, no, it's not that bad of a film. It's actually really well-made.While the legitimacy of Ed and Lorraine Warren and the purported hauntings they investigated are questionable to say the least, I'm going to leave the reality of everything aside and just focus on the film as it's presented. It is billed as being 'Based on a true story', which is apparently true of just about every horror movie released today, but it is at least partially true; there really was a family who claimed to have experienced events along the lines of this, and Ed and Lorraine Warren really did investigate it; I can only assume the writers took some hefty liberties provided the dramatic last act of the film.The direction is great and moody. James Wan, who rose to fame almost immediately with 'Saw', toys with old school supernatural horror conventions and levels moodiness with jump scares, keeping an even level of both which generates a great deal of tension. The cinematography is in accordance with the film's dreary atmosphere, but maintains the glossy finish of a high-budget production rather than going for grain. The set design here is also very nice, and, as a period piece, the film has an authentic '70s feel to it.Another particularly strong point of the production is its actors— the four adult leads are respected performers with ranges that go beyond what's typically necessary in the horror genre, and thus, if anything, their presences in the film elevate what could have potentially been supernatural horror fodder had it been in the wrong hands. Wilson and Farmiga are perfect choices for Ed & Lorraine Warren, and Taylor and Livingston give incredibly natural performances (aside from Taylor's very unnatural possession scene at the end of the film, but that's on the writers' hands).What then, do say, is the ho-hum about? I mean, look— a witch having cursed your land, her ghost and all of her victims' ghosts haunting the house, possessions, flying crucifixes, levitation, Satanism, nooses, children with imaginary friends who are actually ghosts— you see what I'm getting at here? The truth is that all that makes up the plot of 'The Conjuring' is so terribly contrived that it makes the film edge upon boring. Perhaps it's not necessarily the fault of the filmmakers if they were simply adapting the testimony of the people who claim to have experienced these things, but the film jam packs about every supernatural horror trope that you could possibly think of into its narrative, and, as a result of that, becomes a bit of a retread. It plays with all the things we've seen before time and again, and for that reason I found the film a bit of a letdown, at least narratively; there have been a multitude of films based upon cases that the Warrens investigated, namely 'The Amityville Horror' and 'The Haunting in Connecticut', and both of these films bear striking similarities in content to 'The Conjuring'. I would be more forgiving of this if the film had clearly set out to be some sort of throwback to '70s horror, but the high production values and overall mis-en- scene do not suggest this, so it at times lost my complete attention.Ultimately, I'm very divided on 'The Conjuring'. There are some splendidly tense scenes, the acting is fantastic, and the film is by all means very well-made, but its contents make it come off as a conglomeration of conventionality. If you go in with this in mind, 'The Conjuring' might potentially be more enjoyable, but for someone who expected something a bit 'outside the box', I didn't get that at all; although 'The Conjuring' is very well-made and at times quite creepy, it is by-the-books in about every way possible, yet has the attitude that it isn't at all. 5/10.",5,4,8,25 July 2013
Scream," Destined To Become A Genre Classic.
","'Scream' is an above-average slasher film from Wes Craven, who some consider 'the modern master of horror', and deservedly so - he's accomplished quite a bit. The film centers around Sidney Prescott, a teenage girl who is trying to survive high-school, while balancing all of her problems, including her boyfriend and the memories of the savage murder of her mother a year earlier. After a student and her boyfriend are found brutally stabbed to death late one night, the entire town goes into a frenzy, with zany news reporters questioning everybody, and a frantic police department trying to solve the murders. Sidney seems to be all caught up in the middle of it, and as people begin to die all around her, her boyfriend (among others) becomes a suspect.Probably the best slasher film of the '90s, 'Scream' is nothing short of a horror classic. I've always liked Wes Craven's work (particularly his earlier stuff), and while this film is much more light-hearted (for lack of a better term) than 'Last House On The Left' or 'The Hills Have Eyes', it's very stylish and thrilling. The engaging storyline never lets up and keeps the viewer's attention the whole way through. Dashed with lots of dark humor and countless references to other horror classics (even some references to Craven's films himself), this makes for some fun for seasoned fans of the genre. At times the film almost seems as if it's poking fun at some common elements in the genre, but manages to be taken seriously at the same time. Suspense is pushed quite a bit, and there are some spectacularly scary scenes. The opening scene will more than likely go down as one of the most memorable openings in horror history - very well acted by Drew Barrymore (surprising to see her in this film), and just plain scary to boot. Watch the film and you'll understand what I'm talking about.Our cast is led by the wonderful Neve Campbell, the innocent protagonist who is caught up in the middle of a town in hysteria. David Arquette plays a quirky police deputy, and Rose McGowan as his popular sister. And Courtney Cox plays a nosy reporter who will do anything to get a good story. I liked the fact that this film really focused on the actual community and it's reaction to the murders, and how the town became a hysteric mess over what was happening. I also liked the fact that the killer wasn't superhuman - those who find themselves in the track of the killer fight back and give the villain quite a beating, and the villain actually runs (the alternative being taking a slowly-paced stroll while trying to pursue a victim, something that has always kind of bothered me about many slasher films).There's plenty of gore, mostly brutal stabbings and such, so all those gore hounds will be pleased. But besides that, this film has a good story going for it led by a very good cast. The ending was a shocker, and was half of what I was expecting, so I was pleasantly surprised.Bottom line is, 'Scream' is one of the superior modern slashers of the 1990s, and can't be missed by horror fans. While the two sequels that it spawned were good, they were nothing like the original, as in most cases. Craven really hit the mark on this one, and it's destined to become a classic of the genre. 10/10.",10,0,0,22 March 2005
Halloween," Undeniably A Horror Classic.
","John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is one of the best horror films of all time. By far. You can't call yourself a horror fan and not have seen 'Halloween'. Among all of the past horror films, 'Halloween' is among the classics that still stand out to this day and are as good as they were when they were first released.'Halloween' is about a man named Michael Myers, who in 1963 murdered his sister with a butcher knife at the tender age of 6 years old. He was then locked up in a high-security asylum and watched over by Dr. Loomis, and now, 15 years later, he has returned to the quiet community of Haddonfield, Illinois. Laurie Strode and her friends Lynda and Annie plan on having a low-key evening, Annie and Laurie are both babysitting and Lynda plans on a romantic evening with her boyfriend. But what they don't know is that Michael is stalking them - following them down the streets, watching them through the windows, prowling around the houses at night. And he plans on turning an otherwise ordinary Halloween evening into a night of pure terror.'Halloween' builds up suspense and displays true, classic horror at it's best. The score is the most remarkable thing about the film. It's perfect, the theme is eerie and creepy, and is now what the film is best known for. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence give excellent performances, and PJ Soles 'totally' brings life to the Lynda character. The film has some great scenes, including the infamous closet scene which is scary as hell, and Lynda's death particularly. The feeling that Michael could be creeping around any corner, lurking in the dark shadows of the streets is very creepy. The entire setting of the movie is authentic to begin with, Haddonfield could be your town or my town. With minimal violence and gore, this movie manages to be insanely better than the sequels which mostly were gorefests, and is much more effective in doing so.If you have yet to see this movie, see it. I've made it a bit of a ritual to watch this every time October 31st rolls around, and I'm sure many other horror fans do also. I do the same with 'Black Christmas', another horror classic that I'd strongly recommend if you like this film, plus, it did come first. Anyways, 'Halloween' goes to show you what can be done with such a low budget. I have seen all of the 'Halloween' films and let me tell you, this one is still the best. 10/10.",10,0,1,11 December 2004
Carrie," A Classic That's Not For All Tastes.
","'Carrie' is not your average horror story, so I'm warning those who haven't seen this and expect it to be some all-out horror film full of gore, because 'Carrie' is quite different. It's more like a teenage drama-turned horror flick when the last thirty minutes come along.The film follows the basic story of the book, with a little bit of changes here and there, some things excluded. Carrie White is a nerdy teenage girl who is tormented by her high school peers. On top of that, she has a fanatical religious mother, who comes off more as crazy then holy. Carrie begins to realize she has a special power - if she concentrates enough, she can move objects with her mind. This is called 'telekenesis'. As prom nears, a girl named Sue Snell convinces her boyfriend to take Carrie to prom, to try and make up for a cruel incident that took place in the girl's locker room. But there are Chris Hargensen and her boyfriend, Tommy, have plans to turn Carrie's magical night into a night of horror - which turns out to be a night of horror for the entire student body.The acting here is great, Sissy Spacek is wonderful and Piper Laurie, who plays her mother, does a very good job at being genuinely scary. I saw this film at a young age and that image of Carrie's mother with the butcher knife still haunts me to this day. The whole sequence is scary, the creepy score accents Laurie's crazed performance. Sissy Spacek really garners some genuine pathos here, living the sheltered life with her religious fanatic mother, all of the girls at school treating her like an animal. I felt bad for her throughout the whole movie, even after she killed the whole prom. She suffers throughout the whole movie, so you really feel bad for her. 'Carrie' is not a horror film for everyone. The majority of the film is more like a teenage drama, focusing on an outcast high school girl. But as tension builds in the film, in the last 30 minutes, all hell breaks loose. So if you aren't a fan of slow-building horror films, then you probably won't enjoy this. But for those who do, this is a classic. 10/10.",10,1,1,14 May 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Genuinely Scary Suspense Upheld With Wonderful Performances.
","'The Silence of the Lambs' is a genuine suspense thriller that is sure to satisfy anyone who enjoys a good old crime thriller. Jodie Foster brilliantly plays Clarice Starling, a strong willed, 'tough girl type' FBI trainee, whose job is to track down a notorious serial killer by the name of 'Buffalo Bill', who is kidnapping and slaying young women in the area. While investigating, in hopes of finding the killer, Clarice meets Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), an incarcerated, blood-thirsty cannibal who holds information as to the whereabouts of Buffalo Bill. Clarice and Hannibal begin to form a strange relationship as she seeks him for help to find the serial killer and stop him before he kills his latest victim.Easily one of the best and most sophisticated crime thrillers I've seen, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is an excellent movie. To begin, the performances are what really shine here. Both Foster and Hopkins are award-worthy (and I believe Hopkins won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the malevolent Hannibal Lecter). Jodie Foster is completely believable in her role as the intelligent heroine, and really has the audience sympathizing with her. On the other hand is Lecter, wonderfully played by Hopkins - his character is one scary guy, I definitely wouldn't want to be near him. Their chemistry in the film is amazing, and the conversational scenes between them, both of them separated by bars or a glass wall, are tense and brilliantly acted. The performances all around are simply top-notch.The plot itself is an intriguing one at that, and I liked the relationship that was formed between the FBI agent and the serial killer - it's all really interesting. Then, there's the serial killer that is the sole reason that Clarice has any relation to Lecter - because Lecter has information that could help her. The gender-bending Buffalo Bill is shown throughout the movie, kidnapping women, and the viewers get an insight into his bizarre world, mostly shown in his underground 'chamber' under his house, where he skins and stores his victims, dead and alive, and wears their skins. The finale in the pitch-black basement/lair between Clarice and Buffalo Bill is genuinely terrifying, and will surely have you on the edge of your seat. Really one of the creepiest scenes that I've seen in a movie.Overall, 'The Silence of the Lambs' is a movie that you won't want to miss. The performances alone are enough reason to watch this film, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are absolutely amazing. On top of that, it is a truly scary film and one of the most suspense-ridden thrillers out there. A definite must see. 10/10.",10,3,5,23 December 2006
Mother!," Spies in the house of love?
","'Mother!' follows a couple (Lawrence and Bardem) who live in solitude in an expansive farmhouse that the wife has painstakingly restored from a fire. One evening, they are visited by a doctor (Ed Harris), whose wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) follows. The dynamics of the home are turned upside down, and chaos ensues.I won't attempt to give a full plot summary here, as it's truly a waste of time. If the cryptic promotional materials and slim premise are enough to intrigue (as they did myself), then give the film a go. The first half of 'Mother!' is just shy of brilliance, with bizarre character interactions, wry humor, and phenomenal performances from all involved. At times, the dynamics between Lawrence, Bardem, Harris, and Pfeiffer give one the sense that they're watching a zany stage play, and the actors (especially Pfeiffer and Harris) clearly have a ball with this. As the film progresses into its second half, it shifts and expands in ways that are unabashedly over-the-top, and Aronofsky quite literally pulls the rug out from under his audience. The film is stuffed with metaphors that are clearly Biblical, but there are numerous bents and other influences spilling in, most notably 'Rosemary's Baby,' which seems to be a prominent influence Aronofsky wears on his sleeve here; that said, 'Mother!' is a very different film from it. The second act is chaotic and grotesque, and it's effective up to a point, but it brazenly crosses the line that the first act so cleverly toed; and perhaps that's the aim here, but it's not as enthralling as what comes before it. Overall, I found 'Mother!' at times riveting and consistently well-acted. It moves from being delightfully off-kilter and sinister to fiery pandemonium, the latter of which doesn't have the same consistent pull as the former. It is no less a thoroughly weird and engrossing epic that demands attention, but I personally found the second act to run itself thin. 7/10.",7,52,113,15 September 2017
Identity," A Smart, Cleverly Constructed Film.
","'Identity' starts off telling the separate stories of ten strangers who coincidentally wind up stranded in the Nevada desert during a torrential rainstorm. Among them are a limo driver, a snobby actress, a police detective transporting a convict, a married couple and their young son, a prostitute, and many other assorted characters who happen to be in the same situation. They all, oddly enough, end up at a small little vacant motel in the desert to escape from the rainstorm, among them being the wife of the married couple who was hit by a car and severely injured. As the night goes on and the strangers begin to know each other a little better, someone begins killing them off one by one. They begin to suspect the convict is responsible for the brutal slayings, but the murders continue throughout the night and each of the strangers learn that they all hold a mysterious secret...I don't want to give to much of the plot away so that's all I'll tell you, but trust me, you won't be disappointed with this film. I saw this movie back during it's theater release a few years ago, and I was blown away by it all. It's really a great film - not just a great horror film, but just as a film in general. The story to this film is amazing, I have to give some serious credit to the writers because it was so well done. This has to be one of the most original films of it's type, and for that it succeeds very well with me. As the film progresses toward the shocking conclusion, pieces of the puzzle begin to come together in a way that you wouldn't have even imagined before. There were some really scary sequences in the film also that were very well-directed, especially the bathroom attack on the Ginny character - scared the hell out of me. The performances in the film were also excellent, and the film boasts a fairly impressive cast - among them being John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, Rebecca DeMornay, and others. Each of the performances were great, the cast was perfect and played their characters very well.The setting for this movie was perfect - the small, cheap little motel is a perfect backdrop for all of the gruesome happenings. In fact, it reminded me a little of the infamous Bates Motel in Hitchock's classic 'Psycho', the similarities being that the motel was in the desert and the overall layout of it all. Is it a reference to 'Psycho'? Possibly, I can't really say for sure though. Along with the all of the pluses mentioned above, the cinematography was really excellent, the film was shot very stylishly. Everything was very washed down, dark, and ominous, a perfect manner for this film to be presented in, giving it a much more mysterious feel. The bottom line is, 'Identity' is one of the smartest, cleverly constructed horror/thrillers in quite some time. It was creepy, mysterious, had me wondering throughout the entire movie, and the conclusion that tied everything together was a real shocker. Definitely give it a look, you'll be pleasantly surprised. 9/10.",9,1,4,24 November 2006
Final Destination," Surprisingly Original Concept.
","'Final Destination' is a horror movie that you can't help but love - while it might not be the scariest out there, it's originality and creative deaths make it great. The film starts off with a teenage senior named Alex (Devon Sawa) who is heading out on a field trip to Paris, France with his senior classmates. Afraid of flying to begin with, he is a little nervous. But after boarding the plane, he has a premonition of a horrible plane crash that kills himself and everyone onboard. Awaking from the dreamlike vision, he abruptly gets off of the plane, causing a scene, with a handful of other students and one of the teachers following. When the plane takes off, sure enough, it does explode, killing all onboard. But after the horrible accidents, those who survived (thanks to Alex's premonition) begin to die bizarre deaths. A loner named Clear (Ali Larter), who was among those who left the plane, teams together with Alex while they uncover that it just may be Death itself that has a 'plan'. And if the plan is intruded, those who cheated death are going to pay the consequences.This film deserves a 10 alone just for the complete originality of it's story. I've never seen another film of this subject matter, and it's quite interesting how the film plays out. I think it's a great idea for a horror movie, unique and original. The entire personification of 'death' scenario is an interesting thing to play with. The plane-crash premonition was intense, and since I'm terrified of flying anyway, it made me pretty uneasy. The deaths that follow throughout the film are quick, sometimes unexpected, and genuinely shocking. Some of the deaths are anticipated, you know it's going to happen, which is quite suspenseful. But some of the others caught me completely off-guard, they were so abrupt and unexpected that I was nearly speechless. The actors here were great, Devon Sawa fit the leading role as our hero who is trying to save all of his classmates as Death begins to pick them off. Ali Larter (from the 'House on Haunted Hill' remake) plays his helpful sidekick, Clear, very well. The rest of the cast all did good jobs, and we even got a cameo from Tony Todd (of the 'Candyman' series) as a mortician who Alex and Clear run into one night. The ending to film was clever and left it open-ended for the sequels that followed, which were both well-done but not quite as good as the original.Overall, 'Final Destination' is an excellent horror movie. It's not really scary, but it has one of the most original stories among recent horror films, and the creative deaths and inventive sequences that take place make it all the more better. Surely worth a look for horror and thriller fans alike. 9/10.",9,0,2,27 August 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Unexpectedly Original.
","Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is an excellent horror film, mainly because it is so different from many horror movies. It's not a typical slasher movie, it's quite original and has some great moments.It's about a group of teens who are plagued by scary dreams, primarily Nancy. When she has some friends over one night, Tina and Rod go into the bedroom and have sex while Nancy is left with Glen in the living room. But Tina is murdered brutally in the bedroom by an unseen force, and Rod becomes the prime suspect. But it wasn't him at all- it was a horribly burned boogeyman named Freddy Krueger who haunts people in their dreams and murders them. As the dreams the teens share become more and more disturbing, Nancy tries to stay awake as long as she can, and try to stop Freddy before he claims another victim.This movie features Heather Langenkamp (scream queen of the series), Robert Englund (Urban Legend) as Freddy Krueger, and a very young Johnny Depp ('Pirates of the Carribbean', 'Edward Scissorhands'). Wes Craven does a great job, as he always does, in creating an excellent movie that has some pretty good scare scenes. The whole dream scenario was extremely original had never been done before, so that's one thing that I really enjoyed about the movie. The sequels (while I've only seen a few) weren't nearly as good, and became more comic than scary, which ruined Freddy (for me at least). But this one was great, and Freddy is a perfect movie villain.Overall, 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' is one of the classic horror films of the 80's. It's not fully perfect, but it's close. Recommended to horror fans, there isn't another quite like it. 9/10.",9,0,0,1 January 2005
The Birds," Classic Chiller With An Apocalyptic Feel.
","'The Birds' is about a San Francisco woman named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), a flirtatious woman who meets a charming man, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) in a bird shop of all places. Melanie decides to pursue Mitch and follows him to the rural seaside community of Bodega Bay, where Melanie stays with Mitch and his frantic mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and his sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright). But the calm town of Bodega Bay has no idea what it's in for, when birds begin savagely attacking for no reason - swooping from the sky and chasing, flapping, and pecking people to death, causing chaos among the city - is it possible for Melanie to survive the birds?Most of today's modern audiences would look at this film and likely laugh, deeming the plot ridiculous, which is understandable. I'd assume there wasn't a scary bone in the entire film as well. But if you really put some thought into it, you'll understand just how scary it would be if our feathered friends actually came down from the sky and started attacking us - it's a scary concept. Loosely based on a story by Daphne DuMaurier, the script is adapted with little in common with the story besides the fact that birds are randomly attacking people. However, the crafting of the story is well done and the writing is really great - I think that the writers did a solid job making their own tale out of it.The special effects are a bit dated in moments, but in others I was surprised how well-done they were, especially considering the time. One thing I really liked about this film that stood out to me was its atmosphere. The film has an overall apocalyptic undercurrent that runs through all of it. The man versus nature scenario gives the film an end-of-the-world type feel, as well as a communal sense of fear and will of survival (which is brought through clearly in the restaurant scene). It's all very greatly done, and I was on the edge of my seat, to my surprise. Hitchcock was a clever filmmaker, and he uses countless camera tricks and allusions which are really genius.Tippi Hedren, mother of actress Melanie Griffith, leads our cast as the playful, stylish California girl who ends up caught in a terrifying and random situation. Rod Taylor plays Mitch well, and Jessica Tandy is great as his semi-looney mother. A young Veronica Cartwright is interesting to see as well. Sure, the acting is hammy at times, but not enough so to take the film down. I was stunned by the end of this movie, because of how ambiguous it was, and how it failed to resolve much. It leaves you with more questions than answers, and you have no idea why what was happening was. Some may take this as a good or bad thing, but I personally love it when films do that, so I appreciated it immensely.Overall, 'The Birds' is a great little thriller from the early '60s that is one of Hitchock's best-known works. The simplicity and randomness of its story is what makes it so powerful, and it manages to pack a doomsday-feel throughout, closing without ever really resolving (in this case, the ambiguity is a good thing of course). If you don't like birds to begin with, I'd advise you to steer clear of this movie. But if you enjoy man versus nature type scenarios, then it's a great treat. For whatever reason it may be, 'The Birds' is one of those few films that I feel like watching whenever, wherever, no matter what. 10/10.",10,1,3,20 November 2007
