Resident Evil: Afterlife," Feels like a franchise that's beginning to run on fumes
","I normally don't like the term 'this movie is critic proof', because let's face it, no film will ever be immune to criticism, and I don't just mean film critics. Everyone is really a critic when you get down to it.That out of the way, the 'Resident Evil' franchise is the kind of thing that's the very definition of being critic proof. Like the 'Saw' and 'Underworld' franchises, they are a glossy, flashy and for the most part empty series of films that will always receive a critical drubbing, but they have a built in fan base that loves them, especially on the big screen. In the world of the 'Resident Evil' franchise, only a superficial similarity to the video games that started it all is had (it's really 'Resident Evil' fan fiction put into movie form when you think about it), the acting and dialog is largely poor, the action is hyper-edited, and the whole series is empty. So in short, it's perfect for those who prefer movies on the high-calorie junk food variety, so I have nothing against it really. Hell, I liked the last entry in the series, which understood fully that it was a low-aspirations B-Movie and nothing more. So while it's not the worst entry in the series (Hello 'Apocalypse'), the latest entry in the franchise suggests something that is beginning to get long in the tooth.Taking place after the events of 'Extinction', 'Afterlife' finds our heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her army of clones infiltrating an Umbrella Corporation unit in an attempt to take out Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), only to have Albert inject her with a serum that takes away her super powers. In the process, she runs into an old friend in Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), whose undergone amnesia. Thankfully, they find refuge with a group of survivors in L.A., which include Clair's brother Chris ('Prison Break' star Wentworth Miller). However, they soon realize that their safe haven isn't all that safe, what with underground mutants, flesh hungry zombies and a masked monster with a huge axe all after them, and that the place known as Arcadia (no, not the Duran Duran side project) might not be what they hope it is.Got all that? Good. Sure sounds dumb, doesn't it? It sure is. To be fair, I do enjoy cinematic junk food, and there are a few good things about this. Jovovich for one, seems to be getting more comfortable as the ridiculously bad ass Alice, and Kim Coates (from the all around awesome FX series 'Sons of Anarchy') is a total blast as the sleazy movie producer Bennett. At the same time, I dug the industrial rock score by tomandandy, and I even kinda like how it rips off other movies. This is the kind of movie that unapologetic knocks off other, far superior movies ('Dawn of the Dead' and it's remake, 'The Decent' and 'The Matrix' for example) so shamelessly that you can't help but go with it and say 'okay then.'As I said though, this is not a particularly good movie, and is only sporadically entertaining one at that. Sure, there are moments that made me go 'Okay, that was kinda cool', but those were only moments, as there isn't really anything here that's really engaging. It's just kind of there, with a lot of flashy editing techniques and action scenes, but little else. Scenes like Chris meeting his sister are clearly meant to appease fans of the games (and the movies) as well as gain some sort of emotional resonance, but they just can't. Also, I know it's useless to complain about bad acting in a movie like this, but dammit if Shawn Roberts is bad as Wesker. He grits his teeth and talks in an evil tone, and doesn't for one moment do anything to make him a very convincing villain. Another thing that needs to be brought up is the constant Slow-Motion shots, which are used to the point that it almost feels like you are watching someone parody the use of slow motion in a movie. It's no wonder the film feels shorter than it actually is.As I said, it feels weird criticizing something that truly does feel critic proof, but in spite of a few fun things, 'Resident Evil: Extinction' is a rather pointless sequel that barely furthers whatever dumb story there is, and feels like a franchise that's beginning to run on fumes. I wouldn't be surprised if even fans of the previous movies felt the same way.",4,0,1,25 January 2011
Resident Evil: Extinction," Stupid But Entertaining Junk Food
","When I reviewed 'Resident Evil: Afterlife', I mentioned that a lot of today's franchise movies-'the 'Saw' sequels, the 'Underworld' movies, and this one-just don't appeal to me. Sure, I can understand why they appeal to so many, but for me, they're nothing to go crazy for. However, I believe I also mentioned that the third entry in the series is the only one that I find worth watching, so I figured 'Well, why not review it?' Taking place after 'Apocalypse' (which is the worst entry in the series), this movie sees Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her crew-Clair Redfield (Ali Larter), Carlos Olivera (Oded Feher), Nurse Betty (ha ha) (R & B singer Ashanti) and others now venturing the deserts of Post-Apocalyptic Nevada, looking for a way to survive. In the process, Alice has now gained a sundry of superhuman powers thanks to the Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus, and they haven't forgotten about her or the survivors. So now, Alice and co. must battle undead animals, a newer strain of fast zombie, new mutations, and more from the corporation.To enjoy a movie like 'Resident Evil: Extinction', you must at first acknowledge that this isn't much like 'Resident Evil' the video game series. Sure, it has Clair Redfield and the Umbrella Coporation, as well as monsters from the game, but this is ultimately 'Resident Evil' fan fiction author's interpretation of the 'Resident Evil' universe with a fan made character in Alice. Also, while I abhor the term 'turn your brain off' when it comes to movies (even if I did, I'd still hate the 'Transformers' movies), that's what you should do with these movies, because there isn't a whole lot going on from a thematic level other than 'Billion dollar corporations are evil.' This is pure, mindless crap from start to finish.However, this is shockingly enough, sort of fun crap. That's largely due to director Russell Mulachy (whose credits include 'Highlander' and the underrated 'Razorback'), who knows firsthand that he's directing B-Movie bulls#!t, and does it with a sense of playfulness and fun that's lacking from the other movies. The acting is also noticeably better from the prior installments, with Jovovich finally getting comfortable with the role of Alice, and everyone else-well, they aren't great, but they aren't terrible either. Add a few suspenseful set pieces (the best one involving zombiefied birds), a nice Industrial Rock score from 'Saw' composer Charlie Clouser, moments of humor, some fun action, and a sequel ready conclusion that didn't annoy me, and you've got a watchable little movie.Sure, I could complain about the lack of logic, Alice having superpowers, the fact that the movie cribs lovingly from other, better movies (Romero's 'Day of the Dead' for example)and so much more, but you know what? I won't. This is pure, stupid movie junk food. It might not be good, but it's satisfying for what it is.",6,1,2,15 August 2011
Clash of the Titans," 'Damn The Gods?' More like 'Screw The Gods'
","Greek mythology is awesome. Seriously-Zeus, Hercules, Icarus, The Hydra, etc-it's the definition of totally bad ass. When I was a kid, I was obsessed with this kind of thing, and I still hold a special place in my heart for it. So I guess that's why the original 'Clash of the Titans' was so pretty much one of my favorite movies as a kid. sure, The Kraken wasn't originally in Greek Mythology, and it was more of a squid like entity, and looking back, it was a fun but hardly perfect movie, but that's okay. Unfortunately not okay is the new remake of said movie, which is a major letdown.The skinny on the plot: The gods, particularly Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) have noticed something-man is not too happy with them, and are turning on them as well. So, it's time to remind mankind the order of thing, which will involve the son of Hades-The Kraken in this case-laying waste to mankind. But there is a man who is destined to stop the monster-Perseus (Sam Worthington) who with the help of some soldiers, must embark on an epic quest.There are a few things to enjoy about the new 'Clash of the Titans', and it certainly didn't make me angry per say. The Kraken itself is awesome, and many of the visuals and designs are fun. It's also nice to see that like in those old stories, the gods are assholes. The trailer says 'Damn the Gods', but watching it, I though 'To hell with that, Screw the Gods.' But for every thing it does get right, it still comes up short. The acting is mostly unremarkable, with Worthington being particularly bland (though Perseus was bland in the original), and Fiennes and Neeson seeming to be in a competition to see who can overact the most-Fiennes wins, but just barely. The direction and editing is also messy-the whole thing is edited in a way that it at times resembles the world's longest, most expensive metal music video, but sadly not in a good way. The battles and action scenes are occasionally fun, but mostly feel too much like they'd belong in every other dull Hollywood blockbuster movie.Which leads to the film's biggest flaw-it's so hollow. Sure, there's big monsters and spectacle on the screen, but it lacks the heart and enthusiasm of the original. The original was a good example of a popcorn movie done right-nothing spectacular, but fun in it's own right. The new one though, is just another Hollywood movie without much that stands out, and not a whole lot that is memorable. It's mostly a whole lot of nothing.In the end, there's not a whole lot to hate about the new 'Clash of the Titans', but that's because there isn't a whole lot to feel about it either way. It's practically the definition of 'whatever.'",4,1,2,24 April 2010
