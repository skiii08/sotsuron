The Avengers," avengers and their team work
","The Avengers Since we can remember, there has always been that one person who we always looked up too. That person we believed was our hero, the one person who would always run to our rescue, whenever we called upon them. It wouldn't matter what the situation was; unfortunately as the years pass our hero's change. We become to know the real definition of a hero and our deception of them changes, a hero, which is a person, typically a man, who is admired for courage or noble qualities. Such as the character or characters in a book, play, or movie who have these noble qualities. Throughout the movie the Avengers, we learn that being a hero is not the easiest thing, it takes a lot of courage, time, hard ships and team work to accomplish the most impossible. As we see, when the heroic team, Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, and Thor is reunited on the ship for the first time; tensions were high as we expected. They all had a different plan and understanding on how to defend their world and to take down Loki. Their inability to come together and be a team at first is a major factor is their main source of vulnerability and the outcome of Loki being five steps ahead of them. It isn't until one of their own is killed by Loki; that they actually become the Avengers. They put all their differences behind them and finally suit up to stop Loki from taking over their world. The courage each of them has to sacrifice themselves in order to make sure our world is safe is indescribable. The unstoppable force that forms when they all put their special talents and gifts together are unbreakable, their allegiance to one another is their upper hand to taking down Loki. In their finale desperation is stopping Loki and closing the portal, the viewer's get a glance at what a little bit of team work and courage and a passion for something can get you. Their team work got them to close the portal, each Avenger's courage is the reason they saved the world. And finally, their passion and pursuit to stop Loki was their unbreakable bond formed throughout the movie. Overall, the movie The Avengers, was not only made to show the comic story of the heroic team stopping Loki from taking over our world but also to show everyone what team work and courage can get you in life. You don't have to be the smartest or the strongest but if you have a big heart and a strong passion for something, don't let anyone stop you from achieving those goals. Even if it maybe you saving the world from an evil villain.",Null,2,5,18 November 2012
