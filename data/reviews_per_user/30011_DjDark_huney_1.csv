Lucky Number Slevin," This movie is great!
","By far the best movie I've seen since Stay and Sin City.. Amazing how they managed to make such dialogues as they had in this movie.. The whole thing comes together with a plot more complicating then the world itself. I loved Bruce Willis his acting.. That look in his eyes.. You just get sucked right in the movie and the appearances.. further more, I loved the way they get back to everything that had happened and the way the movie twists and turns along the way. It has this typical.. Maybe ... or maybe... feeling that you get while you're watching it..Loved it.. can't hate it, cause after you've seen this movie you'll be so confused by the dialogues which are right, that you can't think properly.. Hell, I don't think I am thinking properly right now.. Although I agree with myself that this movie Rocks and deserves a 9 at least!",10,3,8,19 June 2006
