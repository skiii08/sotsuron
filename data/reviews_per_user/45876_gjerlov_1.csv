Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The saga begins. . .
","I didn't watch the trailer. I didn't read the reviews (although I know they said the movie was bad). I didn't care - because nothing should ruin MY OWN interpretation of what George Lucas wanted to show me. And yes - indeed - I am biased. I don't think I could not like TPM, but I really enjoyed the movie. It was a great start of a long and good story.I think the movie was every bit as good as I hoped it would be. It showed the very beginning of the fall of the Senate, and the rise of Emperor Palpatine. It shows the Jedi council, and how they work (resemblance to the Samurai is so striking, that you can get a lot of 'depth' in the movie - if (and only if!!) you know the history of the Samurai. So to all people that think that the character were 'poor', 'bad', 'terrible' etc. Watch some samurai movies, read a little history of Japan. Educate yourself, and you will see what George Lucas had in mind!! Really!Darth Maul's role was important - if for nothing else - because he showed the true Dark Side (as the opposite of Qui-gon) in the scene where they are separated by a 'force door'. Wonderful scene - for all three characters! Palpatine is brilliant as the 'strong senator'. The Queen - when you see the movie the second time, you learn that she is more than the 'Empress' that she apparently seems to be. Jar Jar. Some love him - some hate him. I love the fact that George Lucas can make me fantasize again. Something that adults tend to forget a lot. And the 'silly sidekick' has always been there in SW. C3PO, the Mickey Mouse Captain, the Ewoks. Jar Jar is not better or worse than these previous - just different. And therefore a good character.The special effects are great. But they do not make the story. Or save the story. This story is a quite good shot at explaining under what circumstances the 'Evil Empire' could emerge.This movie requires that you let go of your presumptions about the world. Imagine things, and George will tell you a story about good and evil. Love and hate. If you are willing to imagine this world, the TPM is a good movie. And if you are not - then you WILL NOT like this movie, simply because you want everything to be 'deep' and rational. My advice - watch another type of movie. Star Wars has always been for kids - because kids will imagine what you tell them to be true. Thankfully this shows that at an age of 27 - I can still call myself a kid :)",Null,0,0,10 September 1999
