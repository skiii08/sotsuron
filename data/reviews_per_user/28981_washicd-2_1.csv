The Blair Witch Project," Was it real, or was it Hollywood?
","From the get-go, this movie looks and feels like the amateur home video 'found in the woods' that it presents itself to be.No cheap, sudden, loud crescendos that force your heart to skip a beat. Where are all of the stunt men?  Where is the musical score?  Where is the heart melting beauty of Sigourney Weaver and where is Linda Blair?None of the usual special effects that will allow you to know that this isn't real.  Eyes ever watchful, ears peeled so hard to the darkness of the forest.  You spend the entire show dreading what will be found behind that bush.  Just you, the darkness, the children, and the rock piles being stacked outside.What a breath of fresh air!  I loved it.  As far as I'm concerned, the sound, lighting, and FX crews can all go stand in the corner.",Null,0,1,10 March 2000
