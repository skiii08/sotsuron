Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite possibly the best movie of the decade
","This movie rocked. If you're a fan of the Star Wars movies at all, you will agree. Critics and other viewers have criticized it's non-existent faults mainly because either 1) in order for the movie to live up to its hype, the messiah would have to appear and walk off the screen or 2) they're unhappy fault-finders, intent on bashing a movie that has blown away anything else produced this decade. One note for you all, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, was bashed by critics and movie-goers alike when it came out. Funny that now it's one of the most popular movies of all time...I'll end on that note.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
