The Hangover," I LOVE this film
","if you like these fast paced, sarcastic and well acted movies this is the one for you. i am a big fan of Zach Galifianakis. seriously, this guy is a wonderful actor. not to take anything from the rest of the cast, i will go see anything he because he just delivers.great cinematography, excellent guest appearances roster.. but specifically, the characters are so greatly combined in the story line, with personal development stories and unique personalities that just work!what else can i tell u? honestly, it's best not to know much... just go watch it and get ready for some fun, laugh and a lot of '... holly s***t i cannot believe i just saw this!!!'it most definitely enters the classic cult ones like out cold.we want more!",8,1,2,16 January 2010
John Wick," great all around cannot cover for weak plot
","i enjoyed watching this movie, john sela's work behind the camera is a pleasure to the eye, great cast, excellent acting all around, keanu is believable and to the point, the action scenes are superb in quality - this movie was fun to watch and kept going. however, non of that can compensate for a weak plot. we are expected to believe that the top hit-man ever born, who struggled so much to get out of the game, is now back because someone stole his car and killed his puppy dog. that dog was left behind by his late wife to keep john happy. if you are looking for to pass on some time, enjoy fantastic cinematography and action scenes - this movie is great. other than that this big hole in the plot, IMO, places this movie at a cool 7.",7,1,5,15 June 2015
It Follows," Great acting, interesting idea, mediocre script
","Nothing can make up for a poor script.There is an interesting idea here, you have sex with a dude, then someone starts following you. That someone/something walks really slowly. They will find you and they can take on any appearance. They will kill you and then go back killing everyone that 'got it' before. Sounds interesting right? I thought so to.Casting was great and so was the acting but nothing can make up for an idea which is half baked and doesn't really go anywhere. Nothing much makes sense as the story unfolds and it ends with a low thump. Some of the later scenes are just funny as you see the writers trying to milk some drama in the pool which does not exist.It's a pass for me if you are looking for a solid thriller film. Unfortunately this one is not it for me.",5,1,2,27 March 2016
The Big Short," Excellent movie
",I don't get the cinematography angel the camera is always moving extreme close up blurred images it is just annoying to the eye will not let you focus. Maybe it looks cool to some people or it is a way to portray the fragility of the housing market? I did not enjoy it.,8,1,2,13 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A viable popcorn flick
","If you are a Star Wars fan familiar with the first 3 films and had liked them, AND did not appreciate the 3 prequels then you may appreciate the comments below.This movie is wonderfully produced with an incredible score and great acting by Daisy Ridley. Many things fall short which I don't think will affect the bottom line and $$ because Star Wars is a brand name, a solid franchise and most parents will be taking their kids to see this movie for pure entertainment.For the rest of us expecting more meaning and depth out of this film, well, I was not able to find it. The plot chosen seems like a safe bet rather than anything innovative and creative. Past concepts and materials were recycled and the guest appearance the old cast members were dull, the chemistry between did not carry well in my opinion to the big screen and over all the story was just boring. Not as boring as the 3 prequels though, so there you have it.Beautifully shot, great CGI, incredible score and that's about it.Moving right along.",6,2,7,27 December 2015
True Romance," Great cast and a 'cool' theme but...
","While True Romance has the 'cool' effect, having a great cast and specific district characters, the story is super weak. Are we really expected to believe that a dude working in a video store (wink wink Quentin), for the sake of his ego having met a call girl is now entering the layer of a drug dealer and pimp, to present and empty envelope to challenge him, then kill him steal his coccain, then embarks on a journey to sell it. He gets his father killed, his best friends, a bunch of cops and other innocent people, all for the sake of $200k. Come on man... :) While the movie is fun and cool the story really does not make sense...",6,0,0,27 May 2020
