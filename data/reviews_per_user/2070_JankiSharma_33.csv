Ford v Ferrari," Being in the race matters for the passionate
","Director James Mangold known for many movies including Girl, Interrupted, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma has directed the movie Ford v Ferrari based on American car designer Carroll Shelby ( excellent acting by Matt Damon) and driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale known for American psycho, The Fighter, Vice, the Big Short). Shelby knows Ken is an excellent driver and can easily compete and win a race. Ken is married to Mollie( actress Caitrona Balfe) and the couple have an adorable son Peter( Noah Jupe ..seen him in A Quiet place). Peter follows his dad to the races and autobody shop. Ken is a simple man. Tracy Letts as Henry Ford II has to decide if Ken can enter car race in Le Mans, France and represent Ford. Josh Lucas plays role of Leo Beebe , right hand man for Henry Ford II and does not like Ken's appearance and mannerisms. I particularly liked the scene when Shelby has to tell Ken that because of his image ,Ken cannot be Ford's race car driver. Matt Damon was terrific as Shelby who has money and power to make decisions in favor of Ken but has to get over hurdles created by Leo. I really enjoyed the scenes when Shelby talks to Ford about how folders had to change hands so many times before reaching Ford and impact of decision making involving too many people. Christian Bale as Ken Miles exudes enthusiasm and passion for race cars and abilities to handle speed. Miles is happy to run the race and not too concerned about winning. Jon Bernthal ( movies The wolf of wall street, The Accountant) did very well as Lee Iacocca who agrees with Shelby's faith in Ken's race car driving abilities. Good ensemble of talented actors. Oscar worthy acting by Matt Damon . 2 hrs 32 minutes of Cars, mechanics of fast cars and differences between Ford and Ferrari manufacturers was truly interesting and very well presented. Excellent Direction.",10,5,11,20 November 2019
The King's Speech," Oscars in many categories
","The King's speech is perfect. Direction, editing, actors are Oscar worthy. Director Tom Hopper did an excellent job. Colin Firth as the Duke and then as reluctant King George VI was amazing. Geoffrey Rush as Lionel, the speech therapist without any medical degree had the demeanor and charisma of a very caring practitioner. And Helena Bonham Carter, Queen Elizabeth, as the wife of King George VI acted very well as a wife filled with love,respect, kindness and compassion for her husband's inadequacies. After a long time ( Jennifer Connelly was great as John Nash's wife in the Beautiful mind), here is a movie about a great husband wife relationship done very well. Calum Gittens , as Laurie Logue, wife of Lionel is very pleasant. The scenes where she finds the King and Queen in her home are extremely pleasant. Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII was perfect ( great even in the Hurt locker). Excellent editing.",10,0,1,1 January 2011
Black Swan," Natalie Portman's black is beautiful
","Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers is excellent as the lead actress in the movie Black Swan. Black Swan has different connotations. To be the Swan Queen, Nina has to exhibit both pure qualities of white swan and sensuality and seductive sexuality of Black swan. Nina is an excellent ballet dancer. She is dedicated and extremely hard working. She practices day and night and is obsessed with perfection. But try as she might , she finds it very difficult to evoke the sensuality hidden deep within oneself. She is afraid of letting go of her deep dark feelings. Vincent Cassel as Ballet group director tries to evoke her dark side and gets impatient when he sees dead pan expression. Having been emotionally oppressed by her mother , Erica sayers (Barbara Hershey , known for the movie Beaches) she lets her emotions surface when she sees Lily ( from 70s show Mila Kunis)the girl with seductive look and openly flirtatious personality. Nina is seductive, gets into a lesbian relationship with Lily and boldly tells her mom to stay out of her bedroom...Nina gets in touch with her inner dark self ...only because she is a perfectionist. Nina wants to be the swan queen . Nina does not want to be the dying swan like Beth Macintyre ( Winona Ryder)...reminds one of Gloria Swanson in the sunset boulevard.. Nina is too focused on being the swan queen...the perfectionist who combines the white swan and the black swan.. Natalie Portman deserves the Oscar. She is graceful and has both pure, oppressed look and the seductress look in her eyes and in her movements. She is the perfect swan queen. Director Darren Aronofsky (loved his other work: requiem for a dream)is superb again.",10,3,7,20 December 2010
Darkest Hour," great 2hrs5minute movie
","Joe Wright , director of one of my favorite movies Atonement, directed the movie Darkest hour. The movie is about Winston Churchill and his first responsibility after becoming Prime Minister. The movie is directed very well and Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill is terrific. Interactions between Churchill and his young, timid, inexperienced typist Elizabeth Layton (good acting by Lily James) are nicely done. Gentle, loving moments of praise and scolding by wife Clemmie( terrific Kristin Scott Thomas )are directed very well. I enjoyed the movie and how difficult it was for Churchill to make decisions. Gary Oldman's acting is excellent and Oscar worthy. My favorite 2 movies of this year are great to watch on the big screen. And those who don't change their mind about watching bootlegged movies don't change anything.",10,1,8,23 January 2018
Passengers," true love when isolated from others
","The movie Passengers directed by Morten Tyldum (liked Imitation game) is fun, fast and interesting with a very pleasant and good looking pair Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora and Chris Pratt as Jim. I enjoyed the concept of time and distance between earth and space and truly enjoyed starship Avalon and journey to planet Homestead II... it was fun to watch a dead human get into supine position and get revived when all emergency procedures are done simultaneously. It was really enjoyable to watch Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt enjoying dates in space and could actually see the love between them when isolated from all mankind without any competition or anyone around for comparison and no room to cheat on each other because they are the only humans awake and dependent on each other. Terrific romantic scenes and both Aurora and Jim had excellent chemistry between them. It is the journey and destination that makes Passengers have a great time and enjoy . Makes sleep/hibernation boring.....Terrific. Enjoyed the movie a lot.",10,8,17,31 December 2016
The Danish Girl," desire from within
","The Danish girl directed by Tom hopper is excellent. Eddie Redmayne as Einar Wegener , husband of Gerda Wegener ( Alicia Vikander) is caring, kind, lovable and a great artist. the love between Einar and gerda is natural and free flowing. After Einar starts dressing as a woman Lili to help wife complete her painting, woman in Einar wakes up and now einar desires to dress and look like Lili all the the time. both eddi redmayne and Alicia Vikander are terrific. the movie focuses on how gerda who longs for her husband's touch lays in Einar;s arms but now Einar has a Lily in him and feels like a woman. excellent acting. I loved every minute of the movie. another good movie about great husband and wife relationships ( Beautiful mind, King's speech and now The Danish girl).Oscar worthy acting.",10,0,4,14 January 2016
Knives Out," fun, interesting, happy murder mystery
","Movie Knives Out by Director Ryan Johnson (Directed some episodes of my favorite show Breaking Bad) is a very different style of murder mystery . Murder of a rich and famous murder mystery books writer Harlan Thrombey(very pleasant Christopher Plummer )in his own room on his birthday is investigated by Benoit Blanc(superb Daniel Craig from skywalk and many fun movies). Whole family involves daughter Linda Drysdale 'daddy's girl'( Jamie lee Curtis from Halloween movies), her husband Richard(Don Johnson from Miami vice )&their good for nothing /parasite son Ransom(adorable Chris Evans from movie Cellular), Harlan's son Walt(strange role for Michael Shannon ), Walt's wife Donna(riki Lindhome from big bang theory) , strangely quiet grandson Arden and Harlan's daughter in law Joni (Toni Collette)&grand daughter Meg. And then there is 84yr old Harlan's mother Greatnana Wanetta who sits and watches the whole family and says only what is significantly important. Harlan's caregiver Marta Cabrera(excellent emotional display by Ana de Armas) presence adds a lot of humor to family conversation and also shows how little one knows about geography of South America... countries Brazil/Paraguay/Ecuador are mentioned by family members when they are talking about dad's help. Script is great . It was truly a delight to watch a murder mystery movie with great script, lighting, youthful energy of actors and grim conversations about siblings lack of trust and in want of dad's wealth.
Very enjoyable. Oscar worthy Direction and screenplay. Excellent Editing.",10,0,3,22 December 2019
The Irishman," Meticulous start to finish
","The movie The Irishman is directed by Martin Scorsese ( whose movies include The Wolf of wall Street, Shutter island, The Departed.....). The movie is 3hrs 29min long and revolves around teamster Jimmy Hoffa. Every scene in this movie is very well directed. Robert De Niro plays the role of Frank Sheeran, the Irishman working with and working for many Italians . Jimmy Hoffa (played by Al Pacino) is enthusiastic about truck drivers and teamsters. Frank takes care of problems and solves problems in a very silent but ruthless style. Frank is meticulous in his work. Another mobster Russell Bufaine , played very well by Joe Pesci (who almost disappeared from Hollywood after the movie The Casino) understands Frank very well and relies on Frank to get job done in eliminating people. The movie is very interesting and shows how Frank mastered the art of eliminating problems. It was truly interesting to watch Frank get a casket for himself. It takes a great Director to keep the interest of a packed theater for entire length of the movie. Robert De Niro is excellent as Frank and worthy of Oscar nomination. Excellent Direction. Oscar worthy.",10,12,29,19 November 2019
Creed," Creed is inspiring
",The movie Creed directed by Ryan Coogler is nicely done. Sylvester Stallone as aged Rocky Balboa is excellent. Michael Jordan as Adonis Johnson is pleasant and natural. Johnson's desire to do well in boxing and learn from the best takes him to Rocky. Their evolving relationship is based on respect and Johnson's hunger for father figure. The scenes in hospital are very well directed. Good movie with great acting. Script is natural and has a smooth flow. I enjoyed the 133 minute length movie. Music was good. I am glad Michael Jordan chooses his projects carefully. liked him in the movie Fruitvale station and adored him in Creed. Both movies are directed by Ryan Coogler. Well done.,9,8,14,24 December 2015
500 Days of Summer," after summer comes autumn
","500 days of summer directed by March Webb is interesting. Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn believes in destiny and soul mates. Summer has no qualms of getting sexually and romantically involved with Tom Hansen (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt)who adores and worships the ground that Summer treads on. Summer is very honest right from the beginning about their relationship. She does not want what Tom wants. She believes in destiny and living a married life with someone she was destined to be a soul mate. It is difficult for Tom to imagine and believe that a soul mate is different from a romantically involved passionate individual. But then when Summer leaves Tom he realizes she believes in what she says. When he meets her after a few days , he is surprised that she is married, pregnant and totally content. His whole life and love revolved around Summer. Love comes in different ways. Love from a soul mate is totally different. It is special. Soul mate love draws positive energy, captures happiness and steadies the soul and the beating heart. This movie is different and very philosophical. Joseph Gordon Levitt as happy boyfriend and lucky to be with girl of his dreams did very well and evokes sympathy when Summer leaves him. Zooey Deschanel as Summer did a great job. Oscar worthy.",10,1,3,2 September 2009
Juno," Juno: a role model for teens
","Juno MacGuff is a fun loving and stable 16 yr old girl. It's very rare to see a teenager have a healthy relationship with her parents. And even rarer than that is a 16 yr old having a healthy relationship with her father and her step mom . Alison Janney as Juno's mother is kind and not judgmental of her step-daughter's lifestyle. Juno is extremely bright without the air of arrogance or an invisible halo around her pretty face. She is bold enough to discuss her teen pregnancy condition and explore potential solutions. When Juno learns of her pregnancy, I liked the way she converses with the father of the baby(Michael Cera from Arrested Development), her own father,her step mom and her best friend(Olivia Thirlby, United 93). Her interactions with Jason Bateman ( Arrested Development)were appropriately handled. Jennifer Garner/Afleck as Vanessa had a very pleasant and realistic approach to a woman wanting motherhood with a passion. Ellen Page as Juno is very convincing as a teenager with her head on her own shoulders and feet firm on the ground. Her intelligent response to Vanessa's abandonment by her own husband Mark is superb.Juno stayed true to her character and continued to live a free spirited life. She did what she thought was right for her and let others get what they want. Diablo Cody as the writer and Ellen Page as Juno deserve nominations for the Oscars.",10,3,9,1 January 2008
BlacKkKlansman," enjoyable
","Movie BlacKkKlansman directed by Spike Lee focuses on more than 5 decades old happenings involving David Duke ( played very well by Topher Grace of the 70s show) and a whole group of whites. But what makes movie interesting is the exuberance and style of Ron Stallworth (extremely well done by John David Washington , son of Denzel Washington ). Ron is a black man and has confidence and sincerity of any hardworking , intelligent human. Ron can talk like a white American and can also talk like a Black americian from ghetto. Adam Driver as Flip Zimmerman is extremely good as a born Jew who has never really focused on his religion and always behaved like a white American. Ron is voice of a whiteman and Flip is face of white man Ron. The movie is hilarious. Movie BlacKkKlansman has humor of a Quentin Tarantino directed movie Django Unchained. The issue of race is sad and it is really nice to give a twist to racial differences . Even Chief Bridges (actor Robert John Burke) was very sincere in his talks to Ron Stallworth . Screenplay was excellent. Director Spike Lee did a great job and so did the Casting Director Kim Coleman. Enjoyed movie a lot.",10,20,45,11 August 2018
Lion," love, faith, courage
","The movie Lion directed by Garth Davis is awesome. The movie is about a 5 year old boy Saroo and his teenage brother Guddu who do whatever they can to bring home food for their mom and little sister. And then Saroo gets separated from his brother and is lost. Ends up getting adopted by an Australian couple (Nicole Kidman as Sue Brierly and David Wenham as John Brierly).The story is sad and happy, beautiful and mean . Even after living away from home for 25 years, Saroo remembers his first 5 years of life clearly, life filled with Guddu's caring and loving presence and mom's loving embrace. Mom, brother and sister made his life lovable and something he longed for again. One of my favorite scenes is when young Saroo prays to Goddess , eats the blessed food and after that manages to run away from a 'nice' lady who feeds him and cleans him up to sell him to a child peddler. Saroo is blessed because he had excellent upbringing from a mother who loved him and taught her 3 kids how to care and look after each other. Excellent acting, especially Sunny Pawar as young Saroo is terrific and Dev Patel(slumdog millionaire, man who knew infinity )as adult Saroo is excellent, both are Oscar worthy. Script is perfect. Cinematography is nice. Excellent Direction. Oscar worthy .",10,1,3,27 December 2016
The Revenant," terrific passion for survival
","I am extremely happy I saw the 2hr36minute movie The Revenant. excellent Direction once again by Alejandro González Inarritu (loved Birdman , Babel )and superb acting by Leonardo DiCaprio (awesome in every movie :wolf of WS, Departed, Shutter island, Revolutionary Road to name a few) as Hugh Glass. Hugh Glass fights for surviving the bitter cold after he is left behind by his team in 1820s.He survives the bitter cold and seeks shelter and warmth inside body of a dead horse after he removes all organs. I love the scenes where Hugh crawls into dead horse empty on the inside. I enjoyed when Hugh makes friends with the native American and enjoys sticking out his tongue and making happy sounds. The scenes when Hugh sees his young son dragged and killed are done very well. When one loves life and has a strong desire to live, one can withstand whatever comes in the way and Hugh Glass proves this in the movie. Terrific. Superb movie. Excellent acting by Leonardo DiCaprio. Superb Cinematography. Superb Direction. Oscar worthy in many categories.",10,3,6,22 February 2016
Dunkirk," excellent
","The movie directed by Christopher Nolan and produced by his wife Emma Thomas is extremely well directed. Dunkirk is all about WW2 between may and June , 1940. Excellent Cinematography. Thousands and thousands of soldiers on land, boat at sea and airplanes in air are fascinating to watch. It is amazing how camera-work was perfect . All actors did their part well. All the land events details took place in a week , the ones at sea in a day and all aircraft details in an hour. The scene where aircraft lands on water and is on fire is exquisite. Definite Oscar worthy for Cinematography. Very appropriate dialog and script is fit for soldiers, Navy, AirForce. Superb. Great direction. Good editing. excellent music. 1hr 46 minutes on big screen . Perfect.",10,29,58,22 July 2017
Inside Out," emotions talk
","Inside out ... terrific movie , written very well, excellent Direction and I thoroughly enjoyed how human emotions talk to each other and suppress all except one. And when that does not happen, there is chaos. Humans have Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Disgust and if not in tune with the inside, disaster strikes. The choice of voices is funny... Mindy Kaling( from The Office) for Disgust, Bill Hader( from Identical Twins) for Fear , Phyllis Smith( again from The Oficce) for sadness(my favorite) and Amy Poehler for Joy( terrific) & Lewis Black for Anger (liked him in Accepted) did a great job. With movies like Inside out and Frozen, adults will have a chance to relearn how to make sadness stay inside and let joy take over. And also love will stay blossomed among siblings even if outside love becomes available. Inside Out is definitely Oscar worthy for Direction, Writing, Editing and Sound Department. loved it.",10,6,29,27 June 2015
The Favourite," Needy women can be favorites
","The movie The Favourite directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (think often of his movie The killing of a sacred Deer) is extremely interesting and tells the story of Queen Anne(excellent acting by Olivia Colman) and her reign and relationships with women between 1707 -1714. Loss of 17 children and Queen Anne's moments of depression, despair and helplessness and attachment to her bunnies are shown very well. Lady Sarah , a married woman (superb Rachel Weisz) and her discipline in learning politics and showing true love, caring and compassion for physically frail and mentally sad Queen Anne are great. And then comes Abigail, simple , nice and loving (my favorite Emma Stone) as a maid but desires to be treated and live like a lady because she knows she is a lady. But then Abigail realizes being nice would never get her what she desires. Abigail becomes hateful and evil and causes lot of pain to Lady Sarah. When Abigail sheds a tear and the scene when she tramples upon one of 17 bunnies is very touching. Terrific movie and I am glad I saw this 119 minute movie . Music is great and the cinematography is very pleasing. Definite Oscars. Emma Stone is nice, childish, graceful, kind, rude, mean and cruel as Abigail. Great acting by Emma Stone. Terrific acting by Olivia Colman as someone in power, rich, depressed, sad, needy, affectionate, afraid to be alone, lonesome . Oscar worthy.",10,6,16,15 December 2018
Revolutionary Road," Oscar worthy performances
","Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank wheeler and Kate Winslet as April Wheeler, are very convincing as a happily married but extremely bored husband and wife. Their boredom with mundane activities of married life and 'emptiness' of daily life is well understood by John Givings (played by Michael Shannon). Michael Shannon did an extremely good job as a certified lunatic with a PhD in mathematic who is recently discharged from psychiatry unit. The interaction among three main characters in the movie is based on the concept of a thin line between sanity and insanity. Kate Winslet is extremely talented and lovable ( Titanic, Little children, even not so popular Holiday and this year Reader). John has a plausible explanation of Wheeler's decisions and plans of going to Paris and then aborting all plans. Oscar worthy performances given by Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio and Michael Shannon. Excellent Direction by Sam Mendes.",10,1,4,12 January 2009
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," violence then.. violence now
","Quentin Tarantino known for violence in his movies and one of my favorite directors tried something different and it is awesome. The movie Once upon a Time in... Hollywood is about 3 different times in same year.first day happenings last for almost half hour, second day lasts for more than an hour and then six months later lasts for major part of movie.
There is hardly any violence in first 2 hrs of movie and my favorite part of movie is last thirty minutes when Leonardo Dicaprio as Rick Dalton is relaxing in his own gorgeous swimming pool with his headsets on , totally oblivious to violence and killings in his beautiful house where his body double Brad Pitt as Cliff Booth is extremely ruthless in getting rid of hippies who have come to steal. Margot Robbie as next door Sharon Tate is very pleasant. Only in Hollywood... only after all the killings and violence , Rick dalton gets to meet a famous director who is his next door neighbor. Last half hour proved that Quentin Tarantano loves stylish violence. Good movie.",10,38,57,21 August 2019
Room," room is perfect
","Too many tears, too much sadness. Story of a teenager Ma kidnapped, raped and made a mom. And mom and son Jack locked in a room away from the world. Really sad when Jack said I don't want to be 5 I want to be 4. Even a 5 year old wants continued happiness in simplicity and in the arms of his only friend his own mother. He wants to be breast fed , he wants to shower with his Ma. He enjoys the only place he knows for his first 5 yrs of his life. There is no chaos from the real person he knows. Ma wants Jack to rescue them from the room. Life outside the room has its' own problems of tears, cries, fights.Excellent writing by Emma Donoghue who wrote the novel and the screenplay. Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother Ma are terrific. Every scene, every dialogue has sincerity. Oscar worthy screenplay. Oscar worthy acting . Joan Allen as Ma's mom and Jack's grandma is perfect grandma, loving, caring, sensitive and excellent. Definite Oscar nominees. Jacob Tremblay , so young and so perfect in every scene.",9,45,89,19 November 2015
Call Me by Your Name," stylish, sensual
","Call Me by Your Name directed by Luca Guadagnino is a beautiful movie based on instant admiration, attraction and body worship. Timothee Chalamet as teenager Elio is awesome. Elio lives with his mom Annella and dad Mr Perlman( Michael Stuhlbarg: The Shape of water, Arrival..) in Northern Italy . Oliver (Arnie Hammer :The social network), an American student ,stays with the family for 6 weeks to study under tutelage of professor Perlman. Elio is drawn instantly towards Oliver's good looks and American ways of relating to others. Passion is beautifully captured between two humans. When it is time for Oliver to leave, Elio is filled with gloominess. Elio learns about life and life's opportunities from his dad. Oscar nomination for style and Oscar worthy acting by Timothee Chalamet. In some ways, the movie had some similarities to movies Beginners with Christopher Plummer and Breathe in with Felicity Jones. What makes Call me by your Name special is the quiet understanding of the situation by Elio's mom who sees the need for Elio and Oliver to spend some alone time. enjoyed the beautiful locations and Stylish Direction of sensual scenes. superb title. Oscar worthy.",Null,1,6,3 January 2018
Midsommar," Haunting wailing and chanting
","The movie Midsommar directed by Ari Aster (loved movie Hereditary) has done a great job at directing Midsommar. I just cannot stop thinking about this movie... the story line, imaginative cultural anthropology of people in Sweden and the entire cast. Pretty and without much makeup Florence Pugh (was very good in movie Fighting with my family: different appearance, lots of makeup) as Dani is awesome. Jack Reynor as Christian, a very dependable boyfriend of Dani is great. Christian's friends , Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter seen him in movie We're the Millers)are very good with their analysis of Dani as a very needy girlfriend. Really enjoyed the conversations among friends when Dani makes several calls to Christian in a short span of time. And then the trip to Sweden with their friend Pelle is the best part. It is amazing how chanting and wailing as a chorus was shown to be a part of end of life celebration , unhappiness, sexual intimacy, misery because of betrayal. Christian's attempts to be nice and loyal to Dani come across as sincere efforts. The movie is terrific from so many points of view. There is lot of seduction and at the same time pure romance and trust. Loved the music and cinematography. Both Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor showed sincerity in their relationship and are very pleasant. Casting Directors did a good job. Visual effects are great. Music/Sound is great. 2hrand 27 minutes long movie and I enjoyed nearly 2 hr of the movie. Great imagination . Very entertaining. Great Cinematography. Oscar worthy.",9,2,5,20 November 2019
Don't Breathe," Blind , strong, Life for Life
","Don't Breathe. Excellent title for movie directed by Fede Alvarez. After watching preview, this movie was on my must see list. Extremely well directed. The blind man, played superbly by Stephen Lang, lives alone with his ferocious looking, big , black dog in a shabby neighborhood house in Michigan. 3 young people, Jane Levy as Rocky, her boyfriend Daniel Zovatto as Money and Dylan Minnette as Alex want to get rich the quick way - by robbing. The blind man , a war veteran, came into lot of money after his daughter's death in a car accident. The 3 potential robbers go to the blind man's house for the money and then come to know about his blindness. Expecting no fight, the three enter his house and from then on, starts the horrible night events. The blind man knows how to live his lonely life despite daughter's accident and knows how to have a happy future. The blind man believes in life for life. Terrific movie. Extremely well directed. Terrific acting by Stephen Lang and Jane Levy. I am not a dog lover and the dog in the movie did a good , ferocious, vicious animal role part very well. excellent cinematography. Good Editing. Overall , a very good scary movie. Do not underestimate a war vet. I enjoyed every scene in the movie. Highly recommended.",10,79,166,28 August 2016
A Beautiful Mind," Definitely beautiful
","I saw the movie after having read that Russel Crowe was not properly suited for the role of John Nash , the great mathematician from West Virginia who ended working at Princeton University, NJ and won the Nobel prize in 1994. I disagree. Russel Crowe is excellent . His accent did not interfere with his portrayal of John nash. Jennifer Connelly as his wife has done total justice to the role of a loyal wife and a great friend to her paranoid schizophrenic husband. I consider Ron Howard to be one of Hollywood's first tier directors. This movie is worth Oscar and these three deserve awards.",Null,0,1,29 December 2001
Joker," Joker is very human
","Director Todd Phillips( Loved his movies War dogs, Hangover) has done better than his best in directing movie Joker. Comedian Arthur Fleck , acted superbly once again by Joaquin Phoenix ( great in movies Her, You were never really here among many others) has a great relationship with his mother Penny Fleck ( Frances Conroy) who thinks one has to be funny to be a comedian and does not picture Arthur as being funny. Some scenes between son and mom reminded me of the scenes in movie You were never really here. Arthur is happy to be a comedian in a place where it is difficult for others to be nice to him or respect him. But mental illness manifests itself. Scenes where Arthur is delusional like his mom in his interactions with his pretty neighbor Sophie (played well be Zazie Beetz) are very sad. Arthur who is a comedian and a joker with a painted face has deep rooted desires of longing for comfort of another human and when not satisfied world becomes aware of his delusions. Murray Franklin, a popular TV host (excellent acting by Robert De Niro) makes mockery of joker and his lifestyle. I really enjoyed how demarcation line between sanity and insanity is handled well by joker. Joker recognizes kindness and meekness as well as cruelty and nastiness. Joker is in total control of his emotions when he walks in front of the cameras to be with Murray franklin. And then insanity takes over and joker does what he does well. Joker ends all mockers and mockery. Joker's laugh which is his expression of his inner thoughts is very appropriate and in sync with his anger towards unkind world. Excellent acting by Joaquin Phoenix . Oscar worthy.",10,0,3,15 October 2019
Parasite," schemes & smell of poor
","The movie Parasite directed by Bong Jon Ho focuses on rich and poor, haves and have-notes. Unemployed and poor Kim-ki taek and his wife Moon-gwang live in very small apartment with their 2 smart young kids, son Kim ki-woo and daughter Kim ki-Jung who will go to any part, any height of apartment to get WiFi/internet connection. The conversation between son Kim ki-woo and his friend Min who wants him to tutor a rich girl Park Da-hye is very touching . Min sees Kim ki-woo as a weak competitor and prefers him to his smart, rich friends who may make advances on Park Da-hye. Then pretty, smart daughter Kim-ki Jung starts teaching Art to rich girl's younger brother Park Da-song. With lies and deceit, the 4 members of poor family end up working in same beautiful rich house owned by successful young man Park Dong-ik and his beautiful , simple wife Park Yeon-kyo. Differences between the rich and poor and the conversations between rich husband and wife describing smell from their new chauffeur are very touching. The constant reminder of class distinction keeps reinforcing humiliation and disrespect of the rich for the poor and the 4 family members from poor background lose control. Excellent Direction even though the story is far fetched. Entire cast did very well. 2hrs 12 minutes too long. Really got bored with story.",7,1,3,23 January 2020
Marriage Story," A story well told
","Marriage Story directed by Noah Baumbach is about a marriage between 'two good looking ' people involved actively in world of theater. Wife Nicole( talented Scarlett Johansson from Vicky Christina Barcelona) Husband Charlie (Adam Driver from my favorite movie BlacKkKlansman) have a son Henry (Azhy Robertson know him from the movie Juliet , naked)and have lived in NY for 10 years as husband and wife. And then Nicole and Henry move to Los Angeles to be with Nicole's mom and sister. The marriage already had problems and Nicole wants a divorce. The whole marriage situation and separation which turns into filing of a divorce is shown very well. The best part of movie is Divorce lawyer Nora Fanshaw ( played very well by Laura Dern) who has a great understanding of why Nicole should get a divorce , child custody and probably money too from her husband Charlie. Nora, beautiful and stylish, is confident, fearless and knows how to win. Her confidence makes Nicole feel meek. Nicole feels Nora is too aggressive. Love between Nicole and Charlie comes and goes . Anger and frustration about turn of their relationship drives Charlie towards anger and Nicole towards self pity. Nicole's need for her husband in every aspect of her life cannot be met by husband Charlie. The decisions they made about never involving lawyers goes into thin air when Nicole involves Nora as her lawyer. Screenplay is great. Laura Dern deserves an Oscar for portraying a lawyer who is compassionate towards the woman in a divorce and at the same time applauds the husband for his talents. Entire cast did a great job. It was truly a pleasure to watch Jay (Ray Liotta )as Charlie's lawyer. Jay is a street-smart lawyer and very competitive unlike Charlie's other lawyer, Bert, who is aging and feels sorry for Charlie( well acted by Alan Alda). Charlie's helplessness in divorce case is shown well by his change of lawyer from Jay to Bert and then back to Jay. Marriage from different angles definitely makes a great story. Oscar worthy acting.",9,8,20,19 November 2019
Bruce Almighty," jim carrey, a charming and talented comedian
","Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey, make an excellent director-leading actor team. TS directed Jim Carrey in Liar Liar and i enjoy that movie everytime i see it. Bruce Almighty is pleasant and Jim Carrey plays the role very well. He is God Almighty, having been given these powers by the Almighty Himself played very well by Morgan Freeman. The movie starts off very well, showing Bruce Nolan and Grace Connelly ( played by Jennifer Aniston)as a happy live-in couple very much in love with each other. But Bruce has problems. He has dreams of achievement and success at work. He aspires for the anchorman position with local television channel in Buffalo. But he loses. Now, he is miserable because he does not get what he wants from God only because God is ignoring him and not because God has forgotten him. because he is angry with God, God gives him the power to be God for sometime. And then Bruce turns quiet, happy, simple  Buffalo residents  into a rambunctious crowd by doing a poor job of answering all prayers without paying heed to what the prayers were all about. Now, Bruce realizes that God does have a very difficult job of keeping everyone happy. So, he relinquishes his authority to God.Jim Carrey is my favorite comedian and never bores me. His actions are apt. His facial contortions are exquisite. One can see practically every muscle in his neck when he makes his famous faces. Jennifer Aniston as his girl-friend is good. She has shown maturity in her acting in the last 3 films i have seen ( all 3 made after her marriage to Brad Pitt), Rockstar, The Good Girl ( my favorite) and now this movie. She has definitely come a long way after making movies like Picture perfect. Morgan Freeman as the Almighty is gentle, nice and good. He has consistently shown his talents in all his movies. This movie is definitely a pleasant treat for a long weekend.",Null,0,1,24 May 2003
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Barcelona is definitely a romantic's paradise!!!!!
","Woody Allen has made an excellent selection of actors and location of the movie. Scarlett Johansson ( my all time favorite), Rebecca Hall (my new favorite) who are 2 American girls in Spain, Penelope Cruz , a Spanish girl from spain who speaks English with a heavy Spanish accent and Javier Bardem ( a Spanish actor known for his Oscar winning role in No country for old men) are very convincing throughout the movie. They are good in love scenes and also in having long sensible conversations. If Scarlett Johansson continues to work with Woody Allen she never has to pick up any other accent. She is always an American tourist either in England ( Match point, Scoop )or in Spain. Scarlett Johansson is a good actress . Her body and her voice are her signature. Penelope Cruz did an excellent job of a very possessive lover and also did very well with her outbursts of anger as with silent sexual and erotic moves. Javier Bardem has shown that he is good with a gun and without a gun. 2 movies with very contrasting roles. Barcelona and other parts of Spain are definitely a romantic's paradise.",8,5,10,28 August 2008
Jojo Rabbit," Timid, pure and innocent
","Director Taiko Waititi who also wrote screenplay and acted as Hitler in the movie Jojo rabbit did a great job. Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo and then nicknamed Jojo rabbit by Sam Rockwell who is Captain Klenzendorf during WW II did extremely well as a 10yr old kid who adores Hitler and has Hitler as his imaginary friend. Meek & timid Jojo loves Hitler's uniform, his authority and his commands. Of course , only a sensible mom who has her feet on the ground recognizes the reasons why her child adores Hitler. Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mom Rosie is terrific. I enjoyed conversations, affection and love between Jojo and his mom Rosie. Having lost a daughter, Rosie tries to shelter and protect Jewish girl Elsa (Thomason McKenzie from Leave no trace) in her house. I thoroughly enjoyed the sweetness and niceness of a 10yr old in awe of Hitler and now liking a pretty , nice Jewish girl in his own home. Great movie . Jojo's friend, another 10yr old Yorki, excellent acting by Archie Yates added innocence, fun and purity of childhood to the movie. Superb movie. Great Direction. Excellent screenplay. Superb editing. Loved entire cast . And above all Scarlett Johansson and Roman Griffin Davis. Oscar worthy.",10,4,8,23 January 2020
Green Book," Real friendship and true respect
","The movie Green Book directed by Peter Farrelly (director of 2 of my favorite fun movies there's something about Mary & Dumb and Dumber) is excellent. Writer Nick Vallelonga wrote about his father Tony Lip acted by Virgo Mortensen (Captain Fantastic , Perfect Murder, History of Violence) and his African American pianist boss Dr Donald Shirley , acted by Mahershala Ali (from Moonlight). When Tony's wife Dolores acted by Linda Cardellini (a simple favor, Mad men) is told by Tony that his job offer is from a colored man, Dolores reacts very well in a manner only a wife who understands and knows her husband well does. Dolores enjoys all love letters written by Tony while he is away driving Doc from one southern state to another to keep up with concert schedule. The screenplay is terrific. Excellent acting. Love and respect among all characters is very touching. Tony and Doc , both very true to their basic nature, are awe inspiring. Great story. Excellent Direction. Superb editing. Definitely Oscar worthy. Virgo Mortensen is perfect . Linda Cardellini is great in supporting role. Great movie.",10,3,6,8 December 2018
Joy," Jennifer Lawrence is a joy
","Joy directed by David O. Russell is all about Joy , all about Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as a daughter of a mother(Virginia mad sen)with anxiety problems , a father (Robert De Niro)who is a womanizer, grand daughter of Mimi(Diane Ladd), wife of Venezuela immigrant Tony( Edgar Ramirez) and a business woman. the scenes where Joy is cleaning the floor, having conversations with mom, catching up parts of soaps on TV with her mom, making friends with dad's girl friend Trudy (Isabella Rosellini) and then bargaining and making genuine efforts to sell her idea on TV with Neil walker (Bradley Cooper) are great. Jennifer Lawrence deserves Oscars for best acting. This movie is all about her . She is terrific. Excellent direction.",10,1,8,14 January 2016
Me Before You," inner happiness
","Director Thea Sharrock directed the movie Me before you about Will Traylor (Sam Claflin from The Hunger Games). Will, born and brought up by rich and stylish parents Camilla and Stephen, is a handsome, happy man who meets with an accident and is paralyzed. Emily Clarke(Game of Thrones) as Lou Clark takes up job offered by Camilla to keep her son Will happy and to bring in cheer to his gloomy, bitter and angry personality. Stephen Peacock as Nathan , Will's therapist is caring and professional. The story is beautiful and the title is perfect. Life is a journey and if not happy from within, the course has to be changed. Enjoyed the conversations between Camilla and Lou Clark. There is perfect understanding between employer and the employee. Lou Clark's conversations with her sister Katrina (Jenna Coleman) makes sisterly love and caring very precious. Samantha Spiro as Lou's mom is emotional, stable and caring. My favorite scenes include Lou's birthday celebration with Will as a guest and the restaurant scenes where seating is for premier membership only. Lou handles disappointments well and takes advice from her loving family for her happiness. Will enjoys one day at a time and knows what he wants from life. I enjoyed the simple and realistic script. Needed a little editing. Perfect title.",8,3,7,7 June 2016
