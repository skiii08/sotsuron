The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Highly Interesting
","I had a bunch of movies to pick from, therefore I went to IMDb and looked at the ratings (which was 8.3). Even though this movie looked just like the very common 'freshman-having-a-hard-time-through-highschool-and-no- friends' movie, it wasn't. It really took me by surprise and I really enjoyed it from the beginning through the end. Definitely worth watching. Thanks to the IMDb community, I knew you wouldn't let me down and give high ratings for a bad movie :). The thing that I liked the most were the extremely interesting characters. Each of the main 3 roles were unique and somehow reminded me of the good old times back in highschool.",8,0,1,5 January 2013
