The Devil's Advocate," Well crafted, wicked & sexy
","This is a very enjoyable film.  There was so much in this film, that you could really discuss it for hours.  Al Pacino steals the show in his portrayal of the devil, what a powerful performance!  Keanu Reeves is good, but less effective- he gets a lot better in the last 45 minutes of the film though.  What really surprised me was how good Charlize Theron was, in a part designed for someone to look sexy- she did one hell of a great job. There are so many admirable things in this movie, and the whole concept was very intriguing.  But what was with the ending?, after the previous two hours it was a slight disappointment, but I suppose its easy to see how it will all turn out in the end.  Its all about cause and effect, so the wheels will keep turning round and round.",8,1,2,9 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Overrated
","I had waited ages to see this film, there had been so much hype after its release in the U.S that I thought it must be really good. What a disappointment. I had read the dossier and seen the documentary Curse of the Blair Witch and had heard people rave about it for months. So my expectations were high- but what an absolute bore. This film is not scary ( for the most part) unless you believe that its true. There is little tension in the first 45 minutes, with the only real terror occurring in the last five minutes- something I could probably have done without. It certainly is eerie, and it certainly kept me awake at night- but I was expecting something more. The woods have unfortunately been a lot scarier in other films ( try Twin Peaks)which was part of its downfall. The film is really original, and the camera work was done very well (documentary style) but it still didn't hold my attention. I found the characters really irritating, especially Heather who evidently had no sense of self preservation. It plays a lot like a student film- I suppose its meant to but I just found it quite boring for the most part and really nothing more than a clever marketing ploy- for which the film makers should be congratulated. However, as a film standing on its own it just does not make the grade. Very Disappointing",Null,0,0,20 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A welcome addition to the Star Wars series
","After reading endless reviews of this film I went to see it, and i was surprised by how good it actually was.  I grew up on the Star Wars trilogy and countless other science fiction films, mainly because I has sci-fi freaks as parents.  Not only did this film take me back to my childhood where many fond memories lie, it also reminded me of just why Star Wars films are miles above the rest.  They are so entertaining, and imaginative, George Lucas has created an entirely different universe and made it real. The special effects in this one are better than its predecessors, but that is to be expected with the advancement of digital technology in the 1990's. The story line made sense as you can see how it will pan out until Episode IV, where it all began for many of us.  On its own it doesn't really gel too well, but it is meant to be part of the series and in the grand scheme of things it is a welcome edition to the Star Wars series.  If I could I would rate it an 8.5/10 because its higher than an 8 but not quite up to a 9. Mainly because Empire and the Original Star Wars were better, but Phantom menace is better than Jedi.",8,0,1,25 June 1999
The Ring," Incoherent Mess
","This film was an absolute stinker.  I had heard great things about it, but when I finally saw it on DVD I was massively disappointed.  The problems I had with it were... that it was not scary, the story was incoherent with massive plot holes and no motives, bad acting, bad music and a sell out ending.  Stay away from this botched re-make and rent the original japanese version instead (at least it had some real style & atmosphere).",Null,0,1,7 April 2003
Chinatown," Intriguing and complex, but what a stupid ending!
","This film has heaps of twists and turns, most which work to the films benefit, as it keeps the viewer entertained.  However, the ending seems really abrupt, almost like the film was not entirely completed.  This film really draws you in, and you're dying to know exactly what happens next. It's also impossible to guess the solution early on in piece- always a sign of a good crime/mystery story.  The actors are all top notch, especially Nicholson, and Robert Townes story is absolutely superb.  A must for anyone who likes a good crime or murder mystery.  Highly recommended",9,1,4,10 July 1999
The Fifth Element," Visually dazzling
","I really enjoyed The Fifth Element.  It is visually stunning with a story way out of this universe.  Everyone does a really good job of preserving their character, not matter how ridiculous it all must have seen.  With a pounding soundtrack, and quick snazzy dialogue viewers are in for a real treat.  The film should be seen on the big screen, as it does lose a bit of its impact on video.  This film takes an unusual approach to the science fiction genre, which is what makes it so refreshing- though I can see why its not for all tastes.",8,0,1,9 July 1999
Blade," Far too graphic, but it has a nice look
","I dont think much of Blade as a film, it was not particularly entertaining, and it certainly did not add anything new to the cinema world, or the tale of vampires for that matter.  It has a very modern, cool look to it.  Blade has a nice costume and some extra special weapons which he puts to good use. But some of the violence was a bit too graphic, and unnecessary.  The story itself is quite stupid and Dorff is really annoying as the evil vampire, although not quite as annoying as his bimbo blonde side kick who really should take some acting lessons.  I was just really bored by the whole experience.  A total waste of money and time, but it could have been so much better.",5,1,2,23 July 1999
The Mummy," Exciting adventure yarn
","I had heard mixed reviews of this film before I went and saw it for myself. I thought it looked good, but heaps of people kept telling me how bad it was.  Eventually, when i did see it I was really surprised because it was so enjoyable.  The cast is excellent, the special effects are really very good and the story- well its typical, not to original but enjoyable.  Obviously this was a totally different angle of the mummy theme, especially when compared to other films where an actor wrapped in cotton strips terrorises people who disturbed his resting place.  O.K so the bare essentials of the story are similar, but the actual way they do it is totally different to all the other 'Mummys curse' films.  Great locations also add extra flavour to the film.  I cant say that it was scary, but it was still interesting to watch.  I'd see it again without hesitation.  A *** out of ****",8,0,0,31 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Gothic, romantic & gory..what more could you ask for?
","There really has not been a film like this in quite a while. Its definitely a Tim Burton film, it has that darkness and obscurity that typifies most of his films, but it also manages to tie in a love story with old fashioned good vs Evil. Its just fantastic. The photography and set design is just amazing, its visual stunning to the eye and also ties in so well to the story.  There is quite a bit of gore, fairly similar to the type of gore in films such as reanimator, Evil Dead etc- its a real horror, but a horror/comedy/romance all rolled in to one. The story in its entirity works really well, it takes a while for the whole plot to unravel, but it keeps all of us guessing. Johnny Depp is in fine form as is Christina Ricci. Its thoroughly enjoyable and i definitely recommend this to anyone who likes things that are a bit darker than your average film.",8,1,1,15 January 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," Tries way too hard
","In the past year or so there have been a number of 'teen films' loosely based on concepts of classic stories and books. 10 Things I hate About You is probably the worst one I have seen so far. From the onset it tries far too hard to be cool, to have a look and feel that will appeal to the teen masses. The only probably is it really slams you in the face with its brutal approach to teen love, rather than taking the sweet route ( She's all that) or the sexy road ( Cruel Intentions), it just tries to exist by shoving the principal story line down peoples throats. The acting is atrocious, although its hard to determine whether thats the fault of the actors or the one dimensional stereotypical characters that they have been forced to play. There are a couple of scenes that are not too bad, but most of the time the viewer is left cringing at the antics of the immature and irresponsible teens and parents on show. The main problem with this film is it has absolutely no point to it, its not even entertaining. A total waste of time and money.",5,1,2,13 November 1999
Being John Malkovich," Very strange, but brilliant in a warped way
","The thing I noticed about this film the most was its ability to really capture the viewers attention and hold it.  I didn't really know much about this film before i saw it, it was nothing like I expected - which as it turns out was a good thing.  It was really bizarre but very original - I still can't quite believe what I saw.  I don't think I have seen John Malkovich perform in a role even remotely like this one - he did an absolutely fantastic job playing himself- but then not really playing himself in the real world sense.  I'm surprised this film was ever made by a big studio considering its extreme weirdness but it was good.  A totally fresh approach to a incredibly new subject matter, this film really opens up endless possibilities...  In three words.  It was great.",9,0,1,23 June 2000
Dark City," Visually Exciting, interesting storyline
","As an overall film I thought this was fantastic, but it did take me a while to get into the swing of things. At the start I felt it was fairly incoherent, but as with many films it explains itself clearly so by the end of the film the viewer can understand or at least appreciate what the entire film was about, and what messages it was trying to convey. There are some truly creepy scenes in this film, but they are all done so well. The special effects are fantastic, and the acting is well above average, especially for a science fiction film. Its one of the films that you can go away thinking about, trying to piece together the puzzle. It was nice to see Kiefer Sutherland back in form, and Jennifer Connelly have more than a supporting role for a change. The whole concept of the film was very unique, which made it interesting to watch. Probably not a film for all tastes, but for anyone that likes sci-fi its a definite must see.",8,1,2,2 January 2000
Ghostbusters," Entertaining, but starting to get a little dated
","When Ghostbusters first came out I thought it was one of the best films ever.  In the year 1984 I was just old enough to begin to appreciate films, I was about 8 at the time.  Compared to the special effects they can pull off today, the FX in Ghostbusters appear to be a little dated.  But the story is still there and as vivid as ever.  The cast in Ghostbusters is one of the best ensemble casts I have seen, there was so much great comic talent.  The story is original, and the chosen destructor at the films end was the best so called villain I have ever seen.  Although in visual effects the film may have dwindled, its essence is still very much there, which still makes it one of the most entertaining films released in the last quarter century.",8,0,0,29 July 1999
A Bug's Life," Expected much more, but at least it was better than Antz
","I suppose from a visual effects point of view Pixar did a fantastic job bringing the characters to life in this story. However, the actually story could have been a lot better, a bit of a let down compared to previous Disney Films. The main characters were cute, and will certainly appeal to the younger viewers. There were some good one liners, but I kept expecting something more to happen- but it never did. Probably the best thing about this film were the outtakes during the credits, some of them were really amusing. However, as a Disney film goes, this is far from one of their best efforts.",7,0,0,29 November 1999
There's Something About Mary," Goofy, low brow humour- but it has something...
","In the past I have not been a great fan of the Farrelly brothers films, however this film is an exception. The dog scenes were probably the funniest personally, but there were heaps of other scenes that are well worth a mention. Cameron Diaz was fantastic as Mary, the girl everyone is after and Ben Stiller was excellent. Matt Dillon was way too over the top- I know his role somewhat warranted it- but did he have to be so excessive? He seemed so irritating. There is no doubt that the humour in this film is of the lowest possible calibre, but it really works- think Dumb & Dumber, but only quite good. Despite all the comic situations in the film, there is still something undeniably sweet in the centre of the story, I think thats what made it work. Its certainly not top class entertainment, but its highly recommended for when you are in a stupid mood and need a good laugh.",7,28,48,19 November 1999
The Green Mile," Magical
","Its a rare experience when a film appears to have a profound impact on your emotions in a particular point in time.  The Green Mile is such a film.  It is brutal in parts, but at the base of the story is something quite different, something many people will never be able to touch or feel.  What would it be like to be able to help people, to read peoples thoughts, to know what is in their hearts?  Most of us will never know.  Everyone from technical crew, actors the director, screenwriter etc all helped to produce a very powerful film.  Its rare when a film can make you feel compassion for the convicted (even those who were actually guilty of their crimes) and hate for those in positions of authority and power.  This film is different to any I have previously seen in its combination of emotional intelligence, history and storyline.  Its thought provoking, emotionally draining and visually stunning. I would recommend it to anyone.  Only one complaint was I seriously doubt that so many contemporary varieties of four letter words were used in the depression era as vocally depicted in this film",9,0,0,1 April 2000
Jaws," Still effective after 25 years
","When I was a kid Jaws was the ultimate 'terror' film, the film my parents would not let me watch late at night, but also the one I most wanted to see. It had been a while since I had seen Jaws, but it seemed to be as terrifying as I remember.  Of course there are shots where the shark looks a little fake, but the camera angles used in most of the attack scenes, or false alarms are excellent.  It still is very creepy in some parts, very atmospheric - with the music, camera angles, pauses by the actors - it all comes together very nicely.  The story is not too bad either, especially when we forget the 3 inferior sequels.  Jaws is still the ultimate monster movie, even with films like lake Placid and Deep Blue Sea trying to reinvent the genre with comedy/horror, Jaws knocks them over anytime.  The casting of Jaws was really very well done, and all three actors- Dreyfuss, Shaw, Schneider seem to have a great chemistry between them- although this is not really seen until over half way through the film when they board the Orca. With Jaws it doesn't seem that the attacks are what are most terrifying, its the buildup.  Its when its very still and silent in the water, most definitely the calm before the storm.  What is most impressive about Jaws is that it has aged very well.  Even with the enormous advances in special effects, and computer generated imagery Jaws still seems to have some real power - heaps more effective than the sharks in Deep Blue Sea.   Jaws has certainly stood the test of time.",9,1,3,20 May 2000
Back to the Future Part II," The weakest, but still entertaining
","O.K, so the second part is always considered the weakest, and from a general standpoint it probably is, but there is still many admirable qualities about part 2.  For a start, the special effects and the visions of the future were imaginative and carefully planned.  Michael J Fox and Christopher lloyd are still adorable in their respective roles.  Although the rest of the cast, with the exception of Biff have little to do.  The scenes for 1955 are just a rehash of the first, but there is very little that they actually could have done to prevent that.  I thought they integrated the new characters into the old scenes quite well, in keeping with the original story from part 1.  Obviously well planned.  Because the end runs directly into part 3, part 2 was necessary for part 3 to occur.  It is a filler in a way which was made into a film of a sort.  My Conclusion, although its not as engaging as 1 or 3, it's still a worthy part of the trilogy.",7,1,2,4 July 1999
The Silence of the Lambs," Incredible! One of the finest examples of great contemporary film making.
","This film is brilliant, there is no other way to describe it, everything about this film is perfect.  When we all talk about a film that affected us the most, this should pop into most people minds.  It is extremely well crafted, from the acting, to the direction, editing, cinematography and screenplay.  Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster are both brilliant, they give us all a clear example of what good acting is all about, and earned well deserved academy awards for their efforts.  This film is so gripping, it draws you in instantly and it holds you there right until the final credits end.  All I can say is what a movie!  TSOTL delves into the human psyche, and questions the way we think, why we act on things the way we do, is anything incidental?  How can we better judge people so we may have any idea to what goes on inside people's minds.  This film is mind boggling.  While it is  excessively violent in places, it has to be so the viewer can visualise the true horror of the character's actions. Everyone involved with this film should be given a medal, what an achievement.",10,1,1,24 June 1999
Before Sunrise," Romantic, sweet and original
","This is one of my favourite films.  For a start Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke had exactly the right type of chemistry together to pull this off.  The locations are excellent, and they give the film exactly the right type of feel.  Whether its believable is another matter entirely, but its nice to think that maybe it could happen.  It has a no hold back approach when it comes to analysing relationships and career prospects of people in their early twenties.  It also reminds us of what its like to fall in love. Highly recommended in my opinion.",9,1,3,30 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Fairly intense, excellent idea
","I had waited a while to see this film, I had heard heaps about it - mostly that there was a real twist at the end.  So when I watched it a few days ago, I looked for the twist from the start.  Lets just say that if you are looking for it- its fairly easy to find- there are clues everywhere!  This took a way the shock value that other viewers may have had when the surprise ending came about.  The twist is good, and if I had not been looking for it- I probably would not have found it, or picked up on the clues.  I didn't think it was as scary as what people said.  In fact I thought as it more as a psychological drama.  Bruce Willis was particularly good in his role, and I feel it is a shame that he was overlooked in the best actor category for the various film awards.  This is a very good film, it is well written, directed acted, although not scary as such it does give you the chills in a couple of places.  Well worth seeing, and watching again.",8,0,0,16 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Time has been kind to it
","Having just seen Episode 1, I watched Star Wars Episode IV again to see if I could get some sort of idea of how the story may join up in two episodes time.  I couldn't really figure this out, as there are thousands of possibilities.  But I must say that Star Wars is still as good today as it was 20 years ago.  The special effects were still good, not as impressive as Episode 1 but for the time, they were excellent.  What is weird is that in basic terms Star Wars is just a good vs evil story, but its the way its done with all the other elements interwoven that make it so good.  The end battle scene is the best, and has been copied many times over in numerous inferior films.  I cant really imagine what life would be like without Star wars, i grew up on it and it holds a special place in my memory.  As soon as the now famous score by John Williams starts up you know you're in for something special.  Why can't they make more films like this?",10,2,3,26 June 1999
Back to the Future," Absolutely FANTASTIC
","I recently watched this film again after quite a number of years and I was surprised by how well the film has held together.  Its really entertaining, all the characters are likeable, the premise is just great.  This is without a doubt one of the best films of the 80's.  Some of the metaphysical aspects of it may be a little off kilter to do with time casuality, past/present etc..  But that does not stop it from being immensely entertaining, and the basic idea and theories behind the concept of time travel are reasonably correct.  What is great about this film is how they use the science fiction concept as a base without straying away from contemporary mid 80s America. This film has a well deserved place in the top 250.",10,2,3,2 July 1999
