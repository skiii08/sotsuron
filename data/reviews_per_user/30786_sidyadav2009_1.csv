Your Name.," Indian guy fell in love with this movie...the most awesome romantic movie there is
","One of the major drawback of being an otaku in India is that anime is still part of a small subculture and so getting to watch anime by legit sources is difficult. You can't buy DVDs because they are not available, Funimation and Crunchyroll aren't active in India and few people get animax on their TVs and these few of those few people realise its worth. So, I started watching anime with pokemon in 2002 when i was four, followed it with Cyborg 009 and Dragon ball z. At a point, I had to stream Dragon ball z in 2009 at really slow speeds. I got 20mbps now but getting to watch anime is still a difficult task. Getting to watch Your Name(Kimi no Na wa) too was difficult but trust me it was worth it.So, this story is about a countryside girl, Mitsuha and a city boy, Taki(that's an awkward sentence) who switch their bodies while they think they are dreaming but the truth is something else...I didn't even read the plot before watching the movie due to the amazing critical reception and highly positive word-of-mouth. I mean that's what Indians do. But it is more than safe to say that this movie has surpassed my expectations. Silver Linings Playbook is not my favorite romantic movie anymore. This movie has outpaced major Indian romantic movies by miles.What makes it so special is the original and highly compelling story line. There is good character development, especially the main characters, Mitsuha and Taki. I can't decide who I like more, Mitsuha or Taki. There is no mistake in the movie that can be seen by the naked eye and even if there was one, this movie's emotional aspect is so strong that it would have overshadowed the mistakes. I can't comment about voice acting here because i don't really understand Japanese. Subtitles are still my best friends. The visuals are striking and beautiful, especially Itomori ones. The degree of the fantasy angle is just right. It leaves people wanting more. Expect many gasps and sighs. The characters do get familiar with each other's lives but there always remains a sense of awkwardness and alien nature of each other's lives. The chemistry between the main characters is very good and it's the way they handle each other's lives that makes audience praise it and write reviews. Tear jerkers please keep tissues at your side. You will need them. Watch this one with your partner even if he/she is not into anime.",10,3,6,7 January 2017
