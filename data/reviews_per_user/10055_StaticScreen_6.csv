Casablanca," iffy about the whole thing
","Sure, everyone says this is a great movie and its a classic, cinematic wonder, and on and on. I thought the movie was pretty boring for the most part. I was almost falling asleep through most of it. I don't know I personally just found the plot to be very boring through the majority of the movie. The characters were weren't anything special either. There were some funny one-liners throughout the script though. I can see how this is historically significant, due to its events set during World War 2, and the actual story being set in Nazi-Germany occupied Europe, which probably boosted this movies popularity. I don't dislike this movie because I think any one particular person did a bad job or anything is particularly wrong with it, it just didn't interest me at all. I must have strange tastes since I see mostly perfect score reviews here for it. Sorry, Humphrey.",Null,2,4,17 October 2011
Taxi Driver," Wash the scum off the streets
","Taxi Driver is often reverred for its pointed criticism of city slums, the hard lives of the people that inhabit them, and the even dirtier world of politics. Even in this day and age, much of these points remain true, and makes it almost ten times a more enjoyable flick, although it's definitely not age appropriate. Keep away from your children's. Somehow this film makes an extremely unreliable narrator, an insomniac taxi driving pervert to be a somewhat likable fellow. The night scenes are shot brilliantly and make it feel more like New York City for real, the freaks really do come out at night. Robert De Niro is brilliant in his role, but I need to understand one thing. Why does he shave his head? Why did he need a mohawk to gain the courage to go and fight the pimps and criminals, and then why didn't he keep it after all of that? I suppose it represents the changed side of him, but he was still a hero nonetheless afterwards. There still seems to be a disconnection between the meaning of his mohawk and the motivation of his actions. Either way I loved this film, I will make my friends watch it, and when I have children, they will too.",9,0,1,16 December 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," grapes of wrath
","1930's. Great Depression. Dust Bowl. Unemployment. Red Scares. The Grapes of Wrath follow the story of Tom Joad and his family to California to find jobs, after their farmland is taken when they can't pay loans after the Dust Bowl. I found this to be a good movie, and it was very entertaining. It's themes also seem relevant now due to unemployment rates climbing nowadays. I found the acting to be well done as well as camera work and all, but the ending left me a little bit confused. The movie starts off about a poor family looking for work, but then Tom has to be on the run for the rest of the movie from corrupt policemen who think he's a rebel commie. The overall message to it seems a bit scattered and almost supporting communism, in a way. At least, in the end things begin to look up for the Joads (especially Tom) and it leaves on a positive note. Maybe I should read the book instead. Oh well, it was still more enjoyable than a lot of movies I've seen.",Null,0,1,11 October 2011
The Graduate," the graduate
","What made this movie hilarious to me, (and probably most everyone that made it through the movie) was exactly what should have made this movie absolutely horrible to watch. Dustin Hoffman suits this role pretty well, being a very young, naive, and awkward college graduate. It's no surprise when his neighbor's mom, whom he has known for years comes onto him, he has no idea how to react. That is what i liked best about the film, was the cleverly written dialogue, and charismatic demeanor of young Ben. I also enjoy the negative take on suburban life this movie seems to have. There are also some beautiful camera work, such as the scene when he is underwater in the suit, or when he leaps onto his pool raft, cutting to him jumping into bed with the devious Ms. Robinson. What I didn't like however, was the gaps in plot line, and how this ridiculous situation just suddenly turned out alright and worked out for the better. There is no way Ben would ever be able to make sleeping with Elaine's mom, bringing her to a strip club, and onto of that stalking her all the way out to Boston, to ask for her hand marriage. And then he takes her away right at the fateful moment of her hand being put in marriage with some other guy?! The first half of the film has a lot of enjoyable moments, but I really can't make heads or tails of the second half.",8,2,2,16 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," not a fan of musicals?
","Then you'd should check out Singing in the Rain. It's simply put a wonderful movie to watch. Even if you're like me (believe I really hate musicals) and find the dance numbers and songs all quite absurd and cheesy, this movie is still very entertaining nonetheless, including many sight gags and one liners throughout the pieces. This movie is something more of a comedy movie, with singing and dancing. How does one not find the scenes they made of their movie 'The Dancing Cavalier' absolutely hilarious? Maybe one who isn't a fan of The Jazz Singer, which they not only make fun throughout the movie, they insult it by name. Quite brave, if you ask me. The one complaint I have (again because I have an apprehension towards them) is when they're dancing in his dream, and it's very colorful, about how he wanted to be on Broadway. I can't remember the name or anything, but it went on a bit too long and I started to get exhausted from it. Thankfully the whole dancing thing cuts back right after. So, if you're not a big musical fan, but you like comedies, and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it.",Null,0,1,6 November 2011
A Clockwork Orange," Incredible!
","What really is there to say about this movie that couldn't have been said already? It's downright excellent. Morbidly violent and very obscene, yes, but what good movie (or book for that matter) doesn't push the boundaries a little bit? Film director aficionado Stanley Kubrick masterfully articulates author Anthony Burgess' classic novel into an even more timeless movie about criminal violence and sex. The movie breaks out from the original novels slang, and makes the story a little easier to follow. Plus one for movies. The point is compelling for and entertaining to view time and time again. A Clockwork Orange is just one movie that doesn't ever lose what was so great about it from the beginning, or any of the graphic shock value it spread through audiences.",10,0,1,30 November 2011
