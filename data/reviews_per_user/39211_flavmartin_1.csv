United 93," realism par excellence!
",This is a great movie! OK having said that..its much more than a regular film release...its subject matter is so dear to the nations hearts that I was worried if it would be overly-exploited in some negative Hollywood fashion. instead I was so pleased it was so tastefully and realistically done. It made me feel like I was there on the plane and in the control tower with the crew and passengers...a certain intangible magic happens that created tension and a certain 'realistic' discomfort in such a way that I haven't felt in a film in a very long time. I believe this is based partly on the fact that the family and friends of our hero's of united flight 93 were involved with the making of this movie both as creative consultants and as inspirations plus add the true grit vision of Paul greengrass...and when heart and soul are combined with such historic subject matters ....you get the ever elusive 'greatness' the audience on opening day upon the rolling of the final credits were flabbergasted ..some tearing....some shaking heads....some frozen...some clapping you came out tired having gone through a plethora of different emotions...this is the 'real deal ' Bravo to all involved!,10,2,8,28 April 2006
