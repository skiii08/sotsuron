Sucker Punch," Waste of time and money on all levels
","This movie evidenced a fact of the movie world that is true nearly 100% of the time. This being whenever a film is advertised to the point where it feels like they are trying to stuff it down your throat its going to be terrible. Or just from pure repetition they are trying to wear down your sense of what a good movie is, its going to be terrible. The reason this is is the people behind the movie know that it can't stand on its own two legs so they have to force feed it to the masses. Good movies don't need to be marketed, they sell themselves, simple as that. Movies like Inception have you hooked the first time you see the 30 second mini trailer. Movies like Sucker Punch and something like Aeon Flux have to beat your skull in until any logical, cognitive ability is completely destroyed. Only then will people go see these garbage movies. Take my advice, if someone offers to pay you to sit through Sucker Punch, refuse, for your own good.",2,3,11,8 April 2011
