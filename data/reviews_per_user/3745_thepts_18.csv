Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Shocking, terrifying and fun. A full movie - more enjoyable than vol 1
","Kill Bill Vol 1 and Vol 2 are two quite different movies, and to be able to describe the movie experience I had today I'm simply going to have to compare the two. Here goes:Vol 1 was highly anticipated by most Tarantino fans and 'film buffs(c)(tm)' - and I just couldn't shake off the feeling many of these people liked Vol 1 simply because they wanted to like it, and because it fit easily into their 'Code of Coolness in Film'. To put it in another way, I saw a lot of people just swallowing Vol 1 whole without being able to explain to me what they found so amazing. Hence, Vol 1 became, in my opinion, overrated. The concept that most annoys me with Vol 1 in particular, is that when a fightscene is introduced, you know the one(s) not being Uma Thurman will die horribly. Then, it takes a lot of time before said death(s) occur.Like it was in vol 1, where you knew ridicoulusly little on characters and background, it left you as a puppet watching people you had no relationship with - shed ketchup aesthetically, and 'fighter B' inevitably having to die.Boring - unless you're the kind of guy/girl who enjoys it to the max every single time you see a gush of artificial blood. Though I'll admit that might have been fun back in VHS days when parents still frowned at 'violence as entertainment'. In Vol 2, events and scenes take more surprising turns than in Vol 1. Vol 2 also goes deep into characters and story, and lets actors ACT in addition to doing the 'grrr!' thing. We see more of the reasons why the characters did what they did - and why they do what they do. Tarantino is first and foremost good with shaping solid characters and solid scenes, and that comes well out for this part of 'Kill Bill'. Vol 2 is also quite horrifying at times, and yes, I am more or less pointing to the grave scene here. That one shakes you good for a long while. Then follows the parodic and fun chapter with Pai Mei, The Bride's strong 'kung> fu'-master - this is refreshingly light and feels good after The Grave. That contrast had a lot of good movie energy in it. A lot of people have been calling this movie inferior to Vol 1 - they're simply wrong - on several levels. I think it's safe to say Tarantino wanted to make two contrasting parts, where Vol 2 had the actual content and plot of the movie. So basically what it boils down to, is whether you were ready for Kill Bill to become a Movie. OK - Vol 1 is quite predictable, but a good 2 hours - it has a lot better music than Vol 2, and is also more experimental in filming than this one.In fact, both are good movies, and as a whole, 'Kill Bill' leaves a mark in your memory. Still, as separate parts, Vol 2 is surprising, shocking, emotional, terrifying and fun where Vol 1 was more or less 'shocking and fun' alone. Was this contrast intended? Probably. Anyway, if you're only going to watch one of them (for some reason), watch this one.",Null,0,1,2 May 2004
Spider-Man 2," Good, but where are Spidermans poses and cocky attitude?
","First of all, let me say that Spiderman 2 is far better than the first. However, I consider the first to be very overrated, so that doesn't say much. Again with SM2, I feel I'm battling overratedness.. so excuse me if I get a little rough on it. >:)The movie contains several gems; action-gems, emotional gems, humour-gems.. Peter Parker vs the two kids (you'll know it when you see it, brilliant), and there were a lot of heart-rushing action scenes. The movie has nerve all along, and you ALMOST don't get bored during the whole film. So why am I so ambivalent about it?First of all: The CG is bad. Sorry folks. The CG is not near the quality of LOTR or whatever. Check out Spidey himself. Like many CG objects, he always seems a tad too light or plastic-y, he doesn't seem to jump or fall with normal gravity. Or Doc Ock's arms, although indeed nice looking, I never really got the feeling his arms were really stuck in his back. So, CG needs improvement.The movie has a lot of emotional nerve, which is a good thing, and an important part of the Spiderman universe. This movie is about 80-90% drama (!), believe it or not. Only problem with that, it's carried by too many 'hollywood-style motivation/emotion speeches'. Yawn! One of Auntie May's went something like: Always follow your dreams, believe in yourself, there are true heroes, don't run with scissors, never abandon your hopes, bla bla bla. Hollywood filler chatter! MJ had similar lines; OBVIOUSLY artificial. Direction also needs improvement.And Mary Jane, she's not ugly here, BUT - she's just not pretty. Her character's made up to be this model-style beauty, which she's not. She was in the cartoon, but she's not a beauty here. Now don't get me wrong, I love the concept of 'normal looking people' in movies, but I hate people obviously miscast. Why chase a marriage-hungry dull girl like that, Spiderman? PS: MJs 'ironed' 2000-style haircut never looked good on anyone, boy or girl. SO: Casting needs impr.... well, too late for that. (I realize you're married, Raimi, but DON'T miscast Felicia Hardy too)The main problem I have with this movie, however, is where it slips most from the cartoon concept. We've seen CG and wire-battles so many times now, it's been done so good before, so why should we remember Spideys battles when we walk home from the cinema? Well. Spiderman's battles in the cartoon was all about poses, Spideys cocky attitude and brilliant lines when he was fighting the bad guys. It was original, it was fun. Where is it here?! The battles themselves thus become a little anticlimactic ('seen that before'), so they just crush a lot of stuff and make Spidey 'almost die' all the time in stead. Comic adaption needs improvement..Phew. Well, as I said; it's not a bad movie, but it's not quite up there as a top 250 movie either. That said, this movie does contain several gems, if you have a 'girlish' girlfriend she won't be bored to tears by it - it IS highly watchable. 8/10",Null,1,2,11 July 2004
Constantine," Slaughters the comic book, but still a decent movie
","As the topic says, this movie does nothing to honor the original comic.. and I mean nothing at all. I guess this is old news in adaptation movies, that fans of the original don't like the adapted result, so I'll be quick: John Constantine is a shabby English guy, part caught in the 80s and 70s, wearing a worn, brown trench-coat. He doesn't spit words out like Reeves here, he's just tired and very very disillusioned. Wants to be the good guy, but hasn't always the strength or the courage. Yes, he does dabble with the Christian universe, but mostly with heathen religions. John is certainly no traveling, believing, catholic exorcist like in this movie. In other words, Hellblazer-fans, leave every hope of seeing a 'LOTR-style' respectful adaptation behind you.As for the actual movie, yes I could yab about how moments like a main character discovering his terminal cancer and another finding her twin sister dead (plus other subjects of life, death and religion) would require much better acting and less cliché. But why bother.. This is a good action and effect movie, that's all.So if you tolerate those movies well, watch until the last part of this, and you might even find more rare movie content, which appeals to the less than casual moviegoer as well.",7,3,18,26 February 2005
Ed Wood," What a great idea to come up with!
","To come up with the idea that people acting in Ed Wood's movies would have lives that were far more unique and entertaining than the actual movies, is an achievement of it's own.An example: one scene from 'Ed Wood', where Ed Wood's team are filming in the middle of the night. They have got a bad 'motorized rubber octopus'-prop without the..um.. motor. Actually, they just stole the octopus from a prop stock. The team have just finished the 'sea' for the octopus, then the scientist, Bela Lugosi, about 70 at the time, steps in the water to 'fight' with the octopus (ie. sit on it, scream, and flap it's rubber flippers around like a kid lost in his toys) after taking a shot of morphine.If that really happened - and stuff like that must've happened around Ed Wood - the people in the set were sure to remember it for the rest of their lives.. surreal, funny, unique situations.Funny film - at times you just feel sorry for Ed Wood, the center of this network of outcasts and weirdos - he basically wanted to make things happen as soon as possible without having the skills to pull them off. Johnny Depp really gives the impression of Ed Wood's will to make it big, and of course, how that driving force ends up making the movies so bad.The whole film has a very surreal feeling to it, at times it feels like a 'normal' biography, and at times it's very much like a 50s-movie with that black and white soul to the acting. The end result gives you a great feeling of the mood that must've surrounded Ed Wood, almost lets you smell his bad props. Nice work by Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, and especially Martin Landau.",Null,0,0,8 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," IT'S BACK!
",".. the not so family-friendly violence.. the lack of Jar-Jar .. the horrific, dark moods.. the long-lasting, tranquil landscape sequences.. This time, George Lucas has let the CG-people take care of the details in stead of the plot! Excellent.. and how many details there are! Good work, CG-people!! Your work is in the scenes, and when you do that well - and only do that - it's so awesome, nothing short of art!OK; this film has it's flaws (like all the SW-movies actually), for instance, C-3PO's hilarously neurotic character is exaggerated - to the point where it's far too much.. why, I don't know. Lucas seemed more restrictive in the cutting room on the earlier films.Yoda is also portrayed on the boundaries of what might be considered disrespectful, but it actually works so well! I mean, he is (one of) the most powerful jedi. Everyone on the premiere started applauding Yoda, and I did too. Excellent stuff! :) I'm going to watch THAT scene again..But there are other flaws - for instance, the romantic scenes with Anakin & Amydala were far, faar too cliched & romantic! I started laughing :D But it worked. The robot factory - where fast paced action timed between menacing machines, was attempted - failed a bit and became VERY 'computergame'-like.Anakin's transition towards evil is very well handled, both scriptwise and actorwise. Also, the annoying kid from SW1 is given new depth as we see he wasn't supposed to be simply 'the cool kid' - moreover arrogant and ambitious.Anyway: the film doesn't have the 'hurried' feel that the Phantom Menace had. It had a lot of good stuff in stead. Lots of moods! Good moods and dark moods. Excellent! Good action scenes. REAL good ones.Another film like SW1, and the series would have been screwed. I would then have had to ignore the I-II-III's and just go for the originals. However, this saves it all. It really does! Woohooo! Good work, Lucas! Get it even better for the next one, and it'll be the best in the series (hoping for all 9 to be made.. :)~ 9/10",10,0,0,16 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It must be sad being a movie critic
","The original three Star Wars pretty much got slaughtered by the world press. Later, in the 90s - the 80s 'Star Wars hangover' had deteriorated, and these critics must have felt criminally unhip when the 70s' and 80s' teenagers had grown to intelligent, young people who STILL proclaimed the Star Wars triology as one of the few essential film-experiences.They must've felt so let out! And most of them - of course - later talk of the original three as movie classics.Now, they've blown it again. As most of us SW fans agree that this movie is definitively up there with the original trilogy, and a far jump from the pathetic tripe that Ep. 1 was, they actually manage to give this movie a worse review than Ep. 1 (!!).. as well as even trying to convince us that this film 'doesn't even convey the traditional Star Wars feeling for the fans'. Oh, really?Imagine working with popular film, and so obviously revealing that one doesn't have the slightest clue as to what film experiences are really all about?Anyway: This movie is really, really good. It gave me the feeling I hoped for for Ep. 1: 'Star Wars - is back'. I know SW fans don't like Lucas' term 'space opera' :D, but we all know that the storyline is supposed to be a bit over-dramatic and the acting over-dramatised. It is, after all, the ultimate space drama.",10,0,0,20 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," A worthy end to the trilogy! Highly recommended. (even Keanu did a good job)
","The Matrix: a pumping action movie. Visually stunning. I had heard very little about the movie when I stepped into the theatre. Two hours later, it felt like some time had passed, but not 'earth time', and definitely not 'two hours'. I had just witnessed 'The Matrix', or 'The Matrix' had run through me.. or something. :) Yes, yes, the greatest action movie ever made - no doubt. Btw: I just read a review claiming 'Die Hard' as the best action movie ever made, which really makes me laugh. 'Die Hard' and similar 80s/early 90s action movies are as close to this movie in the action genre as 'Troll 2' is to 'Lord of the Rings' in the fantasy genre..Anyway, 3 minutes after seeing the movie - me and my girlfriend, moping around outside the theatre half speechless; I still remember that I actually said: 'they can just forget making a sequel to this'. I didn't know sequels were considered, I just figured a sequel would almost certainly be a anti-climax in comparison to this.
Then, 3 years after: 'Matrix Reloaded'. I wouldn't admit right after seeing it that it was disappointing, but it was. A good film, yes, but completely void of what 'the Matrix' had - without sting, without the attention to detail. Even though I'd said a sequel would fail anyway, I still felt it all crumble in front of me - like the Star Wars series, magnificent 'Matrix' was being mishandled by it's creators.Now, finally, 'Matrix Revolutions'. I went into the cinema with no expectations what so ever, the movie had really gotten a bad rep at IMDB and started out at a 6.7 rating, even rated below such completely talentless trash as Terminator 3.I won't comment the content of this film in bigger words. I'll just say that I actually got that 'Matrix feeling' again, the universe actually gripped me. That doomsday-mood, the environments. The attention to detail, the depiction of 'normal people' from the Matrix, the innovative effect dynamics - the feeling of intelligent directors behind it all - it was back. I even felt that Neo and Trinity were in love for real - not kissing robots like in 'Reloaded'.PS: Despite what everyone are saying, great acting by Keanu Reeves. I'm not one of his kiss-up fans or anything, but there's not much in this movie he could do better - or different - as the cyberpunk hacker he is indeed playing.PSII: I almost got a feeling 'Reloaded' was made tame on purpose, to take off some of the inevitable anti-climax effect from 'Matrix', then release 'Revolutions' shortly after so people would see it anyway.
*MINI-SPOILERS - (these shouldn't ruin the film for you, but..) *A couple of flaws - a far too long deathscene (you'll know which one) made an unworthy goodbye for a certain character. Also, The Oracle is played by a new actor, as the original (outstanding) actor has actually died. Although this is well built around in the story, it doesn't feel quite right. The Wachowskis did their best with this though.*MINI-SPOILERS*
Conclusion: There are obviously too many people visiting IMDB who just follow the mainstream. I guess the movie buffs who used to dominate this place have been outnumbered now, and IMDB has become a playground for every mainstream filmgoer without a clue about what a movie experience really is about.Anyway, to me, 'The Matrix' trilogy now feels completed, and unlike what I feared, I don't have to see the first movie as a separate chapter, as I've been partly forced to with the 'Star Wars' series. I accept this ending, it feels whole. OK - as a separate movie, it's not as good as 'The Matrix', and sadly, I guess few movies will be able to equal that as a movie experience. Still, 'Revolutions' is a remarkable movie in the Matrix universe, far surpassing 'Reloaded'.Higly recommended!!",9,0,0,8 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," What a Turkey! Brings the Terminator series and IMDB to shame..
","Me, my girlfriend and two others were on a week holiday to Amstedam when we decided to check out Terminator 3, which I had been looking forward to for a long time; I like (futuristic) action movies, I liked the other Terminator-movies, and this movie had gotten a pretty decent IMDB rating.We stepped into the cinema, and.. what followed was a chain of disappointments and to be blunt - extreme annoyances.
Here are some of the 'goodies' what you can expect when you go to see T3:1. jokes and humour with references to previous films - which very quickly grow very, very old ('she'll be back'). 2. far too long and tedious action scenes (and I love the Matrix, T1, T2, etc and action in general). 3. plot holes with a B-movie, low-budget quality to them. MANY of these.This is the one film where I cannot get myself to agree with or understand the IMDB rating it has gotten. One of the worst, dullest films I've ever seen, has at this moment a 7.1 IMDB rating. IMO it deserves something around the 3.0-5.0 mark. This really shocked me, because IMDB has usually been very trustworthy in this matter.I do not recommend you to see this movie! But good luck if you do..",1,2,4,17 August 2003
Spider-Man," Dis.App.Ointing!!
","Yes, this movie is disappointing. I've heard so much hype from people I know and trust, that I actually had some expectations for sensation & innovation here..I like the nerdy main character, but Spidey wasn't a nerd when he was Spidey. He was a really cool character with all the right, relaxed punchlines in the middle of danger (while his thoughts betrayed that he was anything besides relaxed). Also, when things got a little too 'super-heroey' and the bad guys sported fancy moves and evil, over-the-top cheesy costumes, Spidey always had a sarcastic comment about their suit or similarly, to make them even more angry..Nothing of that here. The only thing we hear Spidey say, is with a squeaky, nerdy voice - exactly like Peter Parker's. Sigh.Of course, we get the obligatory upside-down-with-mask-half-off - kiss, which is nice enough. The school bully get's a serious beating, which is a great scene. There is also some nice comic relief, for instance when Spidey wears his first suit.. that was really funny, but so were the 'worst' love scenes.The evil character is REALLY weakly designed. With the brushed metallic suit, carrying an eeevil grin (help!), it was laughable, and even more kitschily 'I wanna be hitech' than Batman's suit in the latter film.Also, the special effects are terrible. When Spidey did his first, spider-like jumps here, you could VERY easily see what was CG and what wasn't. That was especially annoying when there, in a 'jumping from roof-to-roof'-scene, for a while was 2 sec CG, 2 sec film, 2 sec CG, etc.. terrible.
Attack of the Clones not only - surprisingly (!) - has MUCH less embarrassing, gut-wrenching, mushy love scences, but also is a much more sensational and innovative movie, all over. I thought there might be a 'duel' between these two, but no chance whatsoever for Spidey here.All in all, an OK 'superhero movie' (which is definitively what it is), but except for the nerdiness and personal problems, it has few of the qualities that made the comic a success. I'm sorry to say that this first Spiderman movie will be forgotten faster than you can say 'Two Towers'.. 7/10",7,0,0,5 July 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," LOTR-style atmosphere and no fake smiles! When's the next one coming?
","I don't know what people are complaining about; the feeling of 'kiddie movie', with the fake, wide grins etc, is almost completely gone!I think that's just the reason why some of the previous reviewers were slightly disappointed with this one, because it's now become a 'real' movie. As such, it's inevitably compared to for instance Lord of the Rings (which it is clearly influenced by; Galadriels polyvocal temptation speech, for instance, and some more, is reused here). And, of course, in that comparison, '..Azkaban' is bound to lose.Still, the new style of filming and the darker storyline finally gives us a 'Harry Potter'-movie with a real, eerie atmosphere. That's good. The use of magic feels far more 'real' this time (less fairytale, if you get my meaning). It's good to see that the story-telling accomplishment of Peter Jackson has rubbed off on other directors!In the adaption process, I think the director actually tried to do a 'LOTR' (= to make the movie good on it's own, AND get as much action from the book as possible), but it doesn't have as many minutes to tell the story as the 'LOTR'-films had. Because of that, this movie just gets going from the beginning, and from there on, there's almost no time for 'daily life' descriptions, it's all action and plot, the story-pace at max all the time. Which, I understand, is quite different from the book.Although this movie wasn't perfect, I'm a bit intrigued now. I haven't read the books - at 'Harry Potter'-movies I've mostly come along with my girlfriend (who has read the books).. but now I've really got a feel of the characters, and I'm really beginning to look forward to seeing how the series turn out in the end.",8,0,0,13 June 2004
District 9," District 9 delivers - is sci-fi back?
","District 9 is a movie set in Johannesburg, South Africa. The well known plot of the stranded extra-terrestrials being on the receiving end of apartheid and hatred, starts off this science fiction with excellent originality - and develops from there.The main premise is that the aliens' learned and scientists, have died off due to unknown reasons. This leaves mostly the 'worker class' of the aliens, an aggressive, stupid, egoistical breed. The animal-like behavior of these 'drones' seems the main driving force for the lack of tolerance between humans and aliens.Now for a little bit of criticism: I think the premise of this conflict between humans and aliens, should be explained more thoroughly. We don't really get any proper explanation for why humanity falls into the Nazi / apartheid trap AGAIN.First off, we know that a million sociologists, historians and activists would be standing in line to protest this familiar genocidal scenario.Secondly, later in the movie, Wikus - the main character - in a pressured moment, claims he 'always considered the 'prawns' to be intelligent', revealing some of the prejudice against the aliens. This prejudice seems unrealistic. The aliens have a spacecraft that has hovered over Johannesburg for 20 years, without external power. They have advanced weaponry. Obviously, they have potential for high intelligence.Anyway, I just had to get that off my chest, due to how excellent the rest of the movie is. The thing is, basically, this movie delivers. And not where you expect it to. It starts off as a documentary, and without revealing too much, it morphs through many other genres during the film. Throughout, it captivated me. I wasn't bored at any point.Like other people have mentioned, there are no known actors - excellent. I am fed up with familiar faces. The setting is completely new - excellent. I am also, like many others, fed up with action movies set in the US. (Producers should take notice: Movies that dare to challenge the Hollywood setting, often do well!)This movie was all over an excellent cinema experience, it captivated me through it's originality and drive. The inspired story reminded me of the intellectual science fiction short stories from the early 1900s. Peter Jackson is a brilliant producer, and Neill Blomkamp is an excellent writer/director. This bodes well for the future.",9,1,6,5 October 2009
Man on the Moon," Genius Hollywood documentary - genius Carrey - made me discover Andy
","I'm afraid I might offend those of you who have been big fans of Andy Kaufman a long time. I know that I probably wouldn't like this movie if I had watched his shows and been an Andy fan for a long time myself.Anyway, I think this movie is brilliant. The beginning of it is very much like Andy's performance concepts; everyone remotely intelligent realize that this is a joke on the people who are too stupid to understand.I don't think very many of the viewers turn the movie off after this though - I've heard stories about people watching this movie in their homes and continously heckling it. That's the brilliant part.Right now, the second last entry in this IMDB comment list is actually also an Andy Kaufman heckle .. it's so brilliant that Andy haters are still out there! Because when 'Man on the moon' and Andy Kaufman concepts are funny, it is very much on the behalf of the feeble-minded viewers who demand jokes and entertainment(tm)(c).This movie - a Hollywood production - actually dares to do what Andy did himself - just don't care about the people who don't understand it. I would almost go as far as to say it's a non-commercial film. Even, as the producers probably hoped, a lot more people get this humour now, I don't think Andy Kaufman will become accepted as a mainstream 'legend' in my lifetime - probably never.On the surface, you certainly don't see too much of the actual person Andy Kaufman in this movie. Would it have been possible to create a documentary for the Andy fans out there - documentary-style about Andy? I don't think so - I agree so much more with the producer and director's intent - to make the movie an Andy Kaufman performance - and only let glimpses of his life through.Jim Carrey does an excellent performance - I would almost call him the number one typecast actor - and actually manages to make you forget Ace Ventura and The Mask completely during this movie. His best performance? I think so. I've really come to respect Jim Carrey a lot - to actually make his best performance as an actor a tribute to another comedian, and managing to envelope that comedian's unique style by means of his own acting - wow!Again, to the people who are Andy Kaufman fans and didn't like this movie - I'm from Norway, I never knew about Andy until I saw this movie. But it spread the message. ;) I personally was instantly fascinated, because I could identify myself so much with him. Throughout my childhood, I liked to play with people's/audiences' heads the exact same way Andy did. But that's another story. ;)10/10 - and thanks again to the people who don't understand the movie. It really wouldn't have been possible without you!",10,0,0,15 January 2003
Hero," 'Crouching..' > Hero.. great film though
","'Hero' was an excellent movie for photographic reasons, there is very much beautiful drama in these pictures.However, a great film as this is, you can't help but compare it to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' set at virtually the same 'age', with the same rules of physics, focus on aesthetics (although more of that here) and also some of the same actors.In that comparison, Hero falls very short. 'Crouching..' is a complete universe with a whole society of personalities, hierarchies, and so many complete stories behind each person. Small details like kid acrobats at the market, the nightwatch in the city and so on, it's all done in 'Crouching..', and done well.Hero is a canvas, not a movie. So I'll leave the comparison with 'Crouching..' by saying 'Crouching..' is completely superior as a movie. 'Hero' is an an excellent experience, no doubt about it, especially aesthetically. Though - if you find loong, sad deathscenes disgusting, scary or simply annoying, skip this movie. It's got six or seven (?) of them.",Null,0,0,23 October 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Matrix of love movies..
","Kind of a cheesy headline, I guess, but that's the feeling I had when having watched this movie. That is - not exactly the thought that this reminded me of 'The Matrix', but a very similar sense of sensory overload, having watched a cutting edge piece of work, and at the same time having been touched by a great story.Even though I've seen several Charlie Kaufman movies and liked them all, I never expected this to actually be able to take the concept of a 'love movie' and mix it with the Kaufman-style of realism combined with his quirky, signature experimentalism.Well what more can I say.. it's a good one, highly recommended. I'll definitively watch it again. C. Kaufman is like the big director of our time, enjoy it as long as it lasts..",10,0,2,28 January 2005
The Last Samurai," A gem let down by outdated Hollywood tricks
","This could've been a good movie, a really good movie, because the plot, the epoch, the nation, and the historic setting are all very interesting. I'm not saying this movie's terrible, but it's slightly disappointing.My viewpoint: I thought I was going to see a thoroughly made historic action-movie with samurais. The movie does have quite a lot historical atmosphere, but the strongly forced hollywoodian touches (believe me) in plot and scenes brings it down in quality. Typically, you will have a point where the movie is believable and fascinating, then suddenly, one of those Hollywood touches crushes the atmosphere.*slight spoilers*You will easily see what I'm talking about for yourself.. There are certain classic Hollywood-scenes, like the worried boy maturely exiting the room in distress, then being followed for fatherly comfort and philosophical conversation - or the woman doing her chores when she turns to see her hero returning.. (why, oh, why...) And, classic Hollywood-improbabilities: In a strong hierarchy, everyone who skips the ranks will *always* be considered a weasel (like people who cut in line are despised in daily life), and so when a western samurai-slayer becomes best friends and strategic guide of the leader, none of the conservative samurai protest? Really..This movie also bugs me a bit like The Beach did; a movie set in a multicultural scenario - where the good-looking American is the center of every foreigner's attention - and after a while, admiration - surviving everything and getting accepted and respected by everyone. Yay. :)Again: I don't hate the movie! But it was obviously a gem that fell into the wrong hands: A good story to begin with, good performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), Koyuki (Taka, the widow) and also the people setting up the historical surroundings and costumes. However; horrible, horrible work by the director and probably also producers, for forcing hollywoodian improbabilities on it.. because of that, this movie; a heavy, prestige-filled, atmospheric story, didn't stand lasting >140 minutes.Anyway, I really love movies with a good atmosphere, and there is after all more of that than there is Hollywood stupidity, so I'm going to have to have to give this 7/10.",7,1,2,11 June 2004
From Hell," Disturbingly scary Ripper-movie, badly fact-based. Heather Graham did well.
","This movie pulls off some disturbingly scaring scenes; it's been a long time since I've actually been genuinely scared by a movie, but this one did it.. using very little actual footage of 'gore', but mainly ear-piercing sound, silhouettes and ghastly descriptions of the murders, it clearly gets the message through to us in a sickening way..Johnny Depp is a good actor indeed, and makes an interesting character. I don't agree that Heather Graham is a bad actress here, but her role is a bit 'off' to start with. She is supposed to be some sort of virginal, pure prostitute-character resembling a more known 'Mary'-figure.. you know which one ;) Actually, it looks like she's even been given separate lighting and makeup-effects, making her stand out as white-skinned, angelic and pure. I agree this doesn't work that well here.It's completely untrue, as many of the reviewers here claim, that Heather Graham can't play these sexualised roles, and that she gives off a 'prudish' vibe. Check out her other roles.. It is, though, a bit cheesy to see these two american actors (Depp & Graham) have conversations in obvious fake british accents. :)Anyway, The Plot, as you've probably heard, is down the conspiratory alley, which, from a Ripperologists POV, seems to be only averagely original. Actually, the movie fails at this point, trying to portray a quasi-occult, quasi-psychotic, quasi-conspiratory explanation for the killings. All in all, the good, old 'cake & eat it too'-scenario. Shortly put, I was a bit disappointed about the plot-part of it.The ending was also pretty shabby, and it seemed a bit 'forced' away from the Hollywoodian happy ending(as happy as that can be in a movie like this).After having checked out Ripper-dedicated for, it became pretty obvious how inaccurate this movie actually is, fact-wise. For instance, one thing I wondered about: There is no indication that the prostitutes in question knew each other (it's actually pretty unlikely), and this is a very important basis of 'From Hell''s plot. I almost think this film would've been better if it had gone out of the complex Ripper universe.I recommend seeing this movie as a HORROR MOVIE, not as an actual attempt to reveal what might have happened - and you'll enjoy it greatly.. or maybe not.. mohahaha!! :)",Null,1,2,22 September 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," No Matrix-feeling, did the Wachovskis see Matrix 1? (needs a new rescue-scene)
","The first thing I said after seeing that the Matrix was going to have sequels, was that 'any attempt to sequel this movie would fail'. Regardless to say, I was right..The Matrix gave you such a powerful feeling of 'the Matrix'; it felt so alive in the first film, mostly because you could see 'normal' people and it felt very 'real' in a special way. You could see people working in offices, homeless people, real policemen. In this movie, you get a 'faceless' driver which after 1 second of cameratime changes to an agent.. *sigh*In 'the Matrix Reloaded', you don't really get any sort of feeling of anything at all, and especially not the Matrix vs 'the real world'. The Matrix is here just a playground where everything you see, is very extreme: Freedom fighters, agents, cars and explosions.You actually get to see one - 1 - 'normal' person's view of extreme events. Why not use this more? A LOT MORE! Even though the Matrix is fake, the Matrix-viewpoint was the whole attraction of the previous film. I am of the personal opinion that if you build the tension starting with the small, common details, the heavy effects and big explosions become far more effective. That's why the previous movie worked.This is also why this movie would have sorely needed a 'rescue someone else from the Matrix'-scene. It would give you a solid look into other people in the Matrix and their daily life, and a reexperience of a person's extraction from the Matrix. Also how for instance Neo reacts to seeing someone else exit the Matrix. How could they (the W brothers) skip the 'year 2000 common people' aspect to such a degree? Back then, they made an excellent action movie, and also hit a nerve in our society today by including 'people like me'. Did they not watch their first film at all??The Zion-scenes weren't very good; I can't stand to look at masses being seducted by a speaker, especially with such tame speeches. The masses act really, really, unnatural, and react the same way. There are very few 'real' people there; even though their clothes are ragged and torn, they are so thinly described it reminds you of a B- movie. I've been to many raveparties, and it doesn't look like this.. some great music though.Yes, Trinity and Neos romance is very awkward - I don't think they fill each other out very well - they are too alike physically and mentally. It's just very unlikely two persons like this would fall in love. They seem to have no humour in their relationship, they don't show real joy in seeing each other, they're just 'dramatically in love'.The movie's greatest moments are Neo's re-encounter with Agent Smith (who is perhaps the movie's most powerful/well-played character in addition to the Oracle), and some fascinating revelations to the plot which I won't mention here.PS: The highway scene had a few cool moments, but wasn't as exhilarating as people would want you to think. 7/10 (Matrix: 10/10)",8,0,0,24 May 2003
Inception," Nolan, the architect.
","Inception is one of those movies where 30% of the movie is spent explaining you the rules of the movie universe; we get to learn about 'architects', 'the kick', what happens if you die dreaming under deep sedation, levels of dreaming, self defense in case of people entering your dreams, and so on.The main premise of Nolan's Dreaming is a set of 'supernatural' assumptions of how the dreamworld works, much the same level of realism you'd find in the smarter superhero comics (like Neil Gaiman's Sandman). Nolan has set up rules of the Inception world for exactly the kind of movie he wanted to create. Much like the architects in the movie, he has given himself full power to shape the dynamics of this story.I don't think you can talk about this movie without mentioning The Matrix. There are so many parallel aspects, even accidental ones (Architect, anyone?). You could say Inception is like a Matrix^2. The Matrix does, however, spend less viewing time explaining the main principle of the worlds, it has simpler and clearer principles, it has more quiet moments and a stronger arc. The Matrix also has some very strong, fascinating characters.However, that said, what Inception definitely does better than The Matrix, is to pull off a better weaving of realism, 'real' people and real drama. Nolan is so good at creating these solid, Godfather-like, photographic scenes.The main similarity between Matrix and Inception, is how the open world lets the directors express themselves very freely. Because of this, both movies carry very personal signatures. And as such, they don't overlap; they are both good films in their own right.Maybe from studying psychology, I didn't find Inceptions main rules of dreaming, 'the subconscious' and so on, very appealing. I was a bit frustrated that so much viewing time was spent explaining these sci-fi dreaming rules. This '5 minutes for each hour' and 'layers of dreaming where time was multiplied by each layer..', well. You get my point.But still, despite these sets of silly rules, the movie really worked for me. It sucked me in, it pulled me for a ride through tons of different, wonderfully shot worlds, then yanked me back out again. I was on the edge of my seat and forgot time completely. And that's what happens when you have a quality director, one of our best of our time no doubt, playing by the rules he himself has made.In conclusion: A movie that gives a strong 'movie feeling'. The fantastically woven multi-layered structure of it all, especially with the ending, is why I easily forgive the boyish premise of Nolan's Dreaming, and will come back to watch it again. 8/10",8,1,3,25 July 2010
