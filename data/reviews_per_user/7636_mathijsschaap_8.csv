E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Thank you, John Williams
","As a kid, I was an E.T.-emo kid. Owned the puppets, boardgame etc. The movie touched me many times.As an adult, I'm done with it. Why? First of all, I never liked the character of Elliot. He's a depressing kid, not enjoyable to watch and a character that doesn't even try to make the best of the situation he and his family are at the moment.As Robert Englund once said about the ANOES-remake: You never should start a movie with kids who are already depressed. I think this goes for E.T. as well. There's nothing to like or identify with in Elliot.That being said, I have to talk about the 2002 digital 'upgrades' by Spielberg. The first one in the movie is a good one: E.T. running towards the space-ship, being chased by Keys and his gang, used to be just a stiff doll on a tracking rail. The digital upgrade is a very good improvement.But the rest of the digital upgrades are trash. Everybody knows about the walkie-talkies being replacements for the guns. Even Spielberg himself regrets that today. But the worst are the scenes in which the beloved alien is replaced by a digital version of him. The animated E.T. acts and behaves way different than the puppet versions and moves as if the laws of nature towards physical life do not count for his part. The additional scenes add nothing to the movie. I was looking forward to them when I first heard about it, but they were a letdown.Because of these reasons I have grown to dislike E.T. Except for the soundtrack by John Williams. Listeneing to that is a time-travel trip back to 1982 when as a kid I was enachented by the magic of this movie. Thank you, John Williams!",5,1,10,12 September 2019
Split," Return of the M.
","Shyamalan is back! Ever since we heard of this movie, we wanted to see it, especially 'cause I work in the psychiatric care field. But it wasn't until we started to watch it that I knew Shyamalan directed this one!Shyamalan is back! With this movie, he proves he managed to prove us he rediscovered his mojo that he had when we were introduced to 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' and... Hack: I even loved 'Signs'!His movies from 'The Village' and on were very disappointing. But 'Split' is good old fashion M.-work.James McAvoy does an amazing job and shows us that not only Edward Norton can play these kind of degenerated characters. Ans the ending with Bruce Willis... It made me feel super... Unbreakable even ;-)Love it man! Haters just have no idea what film making is about...",8,25,37,27 June 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino touched me with this one
","I'm a Tarantino fan. Nothing special about that, but I have to admit I didn't enjoy 'The Hateful Eight' at all. That one was a letdown.But 'Once upon a time' is Tarantino at his best. Leo DiCaprio portrays an actor who has had his golden years, but in the end turns out to be a hero. Why? Because we, the audience, know the real story behind Sharon Tate and the Manson family and Tarantino's take which means leading it in another, fictional direction, makes Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth heroes for the public who recognise their influence on the Manson family and preventing the murders on Sharon Tate and her guests. That touched me. It moved me. It speaks to the subconcious that many people will share: the idea that horror can be prevented. Like the wish we could travel back in time and prevent something, because we know it will happen if we don't interfere.Having explored every detail in the Manson murders myself when I was in my twenties, made me quite emotional watching Sharon Tate surviving the Manson family without her realising what the horrible truth the real Sharon Tate had to face in real life.I think I would have liked more screentime for Steve McQueen and more other famous characters from the past, but this movie is the Tarantino one that is very enjoyable and both touching at the same time.I Always look for the Dutch elements in Tarantino movies. This time, I didn''t have to look very hard. The blue neon windmill in the Hollywood hills as Brad Pitt is driving there, was Obvious in a nice, subtle way.",9,6,11,11 September 2019
Jurassic World," Only made for CGI reasons...
","Wow, what a huge disappointment Jurassic World was! There was nothing, absolutely nothing new to the story. It looked like the producers were like 'Hey, there was this movie in 1993, which made a lot of money. The beasties from the sequels and some we invent our own can be put in a movie. But let's just use the same old story, because we can't come up with anything original on our own'.The size of the Mosasur was tremendously exaggerated. Mosasaurs were never this big. And what did the crew think about Triceratops? Let's look at biblical fundamentalist Ken Ham's 'Creation Museum' and saddle back the triceratops? Come on already...We all know that the biggest creatures in nature like whales, elephants, rhino's, etc. have no natural enemies and don't need camouflage skills in order to hunt or survive. So what's the point about this DNA cocktail that's supposed to be the main big event in this movie?Same old story combined with ridiculous ideas. No need to watch it again...",4,1,6,11 October 2015
Avatar," Ashtonishing cinema, dreadful storyline
","I remember watching 'Avatar' in cinema. It was a beautiful experience to watch, but way too long in running time and predictable in storyline after only 5 minutes.James Cameron's ongoing same storyline of human industrialism pushing the buttons and finally costing our heads is always present in his movies. Wheter it is about fictional human inventions like a Terminator, exploring space and bumping into a bunch of predator aliens (I know he made a sequel to a movie he wasn't involved with, but still...), the forces of nature in 'Titanic' and so on, Cameron didn't even try to come up with an original storyline in this one.Instead, the story weighs heavily on beaten paths, predictable story lines and stereotype characters in a movie that could have been so much more.I cannot bear watching it anymore. Maybe for about 45 minutes and then I'm bored to death, even slightly irritated.It's a shame, because it is such a beautiful experience for our ocular organs.It's a pity. A lost chance.",3,2,4,6 March 2016
The Fly," The Fly (1986) 30 years later...
","Recently I decided to watch 'The Fly' again since a long time and I experienced it from e fresh point of view.It is the only horror remake ever to be way better than the original version. I do know that 'The Thing' by John Carpenter is a great one too, but that one is not based on the original movie, but another interpretation of the same book on which the earlier movie was also based.'The Fly' still is an artistic masterpiece. Many of the effects have survived the test of time and of course every review on the internet describes this remake as way better than the earlier movie.When it came out in 1986, many viewers considered it as a cultural metaphor for AIDS, while David Cronenberg never thought of it that way. Cronenberg's view was that it is a metaphor for illness in general and also the process of aging, like midlife crisis.Watching it today and being a nurse in psychiatric fields, makes me interpretate it as a metaphor also for psychiatric conditions, like bipolar disorders or something likewise.Over here in Holland, Dutch actor Anthonie Kamerling was bipolar and he committed suicide. Having been depressed for a long period of time, he was energetic to the max, day and night, just before he killed himself.Manical people don't consider themselves as ill. They're feeling great, life is one big party time. Their families and environment do know something's wrong with them by intuition, but they can't put a finger on it. Anthonie's wife Isa Hoes, also a Dutch actress, wrote a book about him and she described how Anthony was way more powerful with words than she is.'The Fly' tells us a story with same elements within the process of Seth Brundle. After his teleportation, he starts to change in behavior and this proceeds until he starts to see something is wrong with him. By then, it already is too late for him and his breakdown and degeneration as a human being has already become unstoppable. That of course is put in the story for dramatic purposes and it shouldn't be taken as a truthful standard process in illness in general. In reality, much can be done to treat the diseases that I've mentioned and to stabilize them or control them, even though bipolar disorder is not without risk.'The Fly' is a great horror movie that survives the test of time and will never know another remake better then this one...",10,1,2,18 September 2015
Kong: Skull Island," Can I give this movie a 20?
","Man, do I love this movie! We watched it in cinema, and this week again on bluray. I was on the edge of my seat both times the whole movie.Astonoshing photography, filmed on beautiful locations, a lot of action, 'Tour of Duty' atmospheres and re-inventing a Kong story in a good way. John C. Reilly and the other actors give a good performance, the beasts are re-invented in surprising new way and nothing looks ridiculous.Peter Jackson's 2005 remake was a visual beautiful experience, but a familiar story that originally was 80 minutes, stretched out to 180 minutes which made it a torture for your butt to sit that long. It also took way too long before we got a glimpse of the mighty Kong. The xtras in that movie got crushed under the feet of the dinosaurs and the leading actors ran between the dinosaurs unharmed.This movie is anything but all that. I love it, man! Best Kong movie ever!",10,0,2,14 July 2017
The Conjuring," The best!
","I actually kind of accidentally went to see 'The Conjuring'. My father told me about a scary movie about a haunted doll he thought was very frightening, and my stepmother thought it was this movie. It appeared to be the spin-off 'Annabelle' he was talking about, but before I discovered that, 'The Conjuring' had already put a spell on me.The first time I made the mistake of watching it alone in the middle of the night. You shouldn't do that... You really shouldn't do that! It scared the hell out of me and I had to watch it five times again before I actually could say I had seen the complete movie.Even though the effects are amazing, the scariest little thing to me was the clapping hands on the basement staircase. It is said this movie is based on a true story and that can be possible, probable, but I seriously doubt these events could happen to a person or a family this way.Vera Farmiga has become one of my favorite actresses because of her part in this movie, and also because of her performance as Norma Bates in the 'Bates Motel' TV-series.'The Conjuring' is perfect all the way and -to me- the best I've ever seen concerning supernatural horror-flicks. And yes, to me it even leaves 'The Exorcist' behind ;-)",10,1,2,20 September 2015
