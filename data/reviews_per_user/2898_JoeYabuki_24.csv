Ford v Ferrari," One of the best movies i have seen in my life
","Text: It has adrenaline from start to end with touches of drama. Excellent tempo. Very good script and direction. Very convincing performances. It is accompanied by a very good music that immerses you along it. The movie lasts 2 hours 32 minutes and you don't feel them, it's worth it, you enjoy every goddamn second. I hadn't felt this way for a long time, and I don't know about cars and they don't attract me, but the movie is made with love, in addition to everything you learn from history with this based on real life. I could watch it a thousand times.",10,5,15,14 November 2019

Hereditary," A really well shot movie
","The cinematography is exquisite; well directed; great performances of all the actors; really disturbing, crude, and teerifying. The film is pretty slow but not bad, it's a good plot and you are constantly mute staring the screen waiting for things to come and trying to figure out what is going on. Altough however the third act is terrible, it decays miserably at the end; some visual FX are poor (like the fire); it isn't the new 'The Exorcist', 'The Shinning' or 'Psycho'. Highly recommended if you like movies and horror.",7,0,4,8 June 2018
Rocketman," Better than Bohemian Rhapsody
","It's impossible not to compare it with Bohemian Rhapsody. I'm sorry for whoever liked that one 'about Queen' but it wasn't very good, with songs put only 'cause they're famous, if you ask the ones that like it, they just tell you that the recreation of the concert at the end is excellent, THAT'S NOT A MOVIE, if you want to see a concert you go to YT. Well, Rocketman is everything that the other wasn't: extraordinary performance by all the actors, spectacular script, great direction and scenery, drama and empathy for the characters, the drama with his parents is very emotional, they dive into his homosexual relationships and drug addiction. The director (Dexter Fletcher) is the same as Bohemian: it was Bryan Singer but Fletcher finished it. Another thing that went well is 'the musical', Bohemian or A Star Is Born were not, they were about singers and that's why there were songs. I don't like the musical genre but this one is very good. The songs are very well integrated to what he tells us. In the end it feels long and stretched. 'The Lion King' o 'Sacrifice' are missing.",8,4,9,5 June 2019
Captain Marvel," It is not bad at all. But it lacks epicity
","It is not bad at all. But it lacks epicity. A LOT OF Marvel movies are better than this one. At last we see how Nicholas loses his eye. The first minutes are in space and it looks well (good start), then everything happens on Earth (1995), and in the end there is a fight that lacks substance. It's not an action movie but a mix among 60% drama, 15% comedy and 25% action, it's a 'buddy movie' and Nick and Carol have good chemistry. There are deceptions and plot twist but they didn't 'touch' me. The villain on duty is not memorable but talking about him would be spoilers. Fury and the supporting characters are wonderful and raise the film and help the drama that Vers takes, that although Brie Larson's performance is good, the film is light. It reminds me at times to Men In Black, the races and persecutions of Star Wars, ID4 and some other movies (that is, it drinks a lot from other films and copy them). Wonder Woman is way better.P.S.: if you know about comics you will not like the twist but I review the movie, not the comics.",7,2,4,8 March 2019

Us," Great start but absurd and meaningless things
","I found the movie BAD, with stupid, absurd and meaningless things. There is a 'mirror world' where we have the typical 'evil twin' (Doppelg√§nger) and these arrive to take over our places. If they were from another universe, dimension, alternate reality or mirror reality, it would make sense, but in the end it turns out that they are clones that live underground hidden from the surface. How can billions live in those places? How do they feed? Why did the government make those clones? Many holes in the plot. And that final 'twist' emulating Shyamalan: TOTALLY PREDICTABLE. None of us in the cinema seemed good. People mocked when things happened. At the end of the movie you DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING about how unlikely it is. I didn't connect with it, it didn't touch me. That been said, Lupita's performance is superb, great interpretation.",5,5,9,23 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Better than the first one
","Better than the first one. Really funny, dark humor, lots of action sequences, gore, romance, drama and the most sad moments i've watched in a lot of time. Many references to pop culture (OST as well) and Marvel, and it mocks on DC Comics and Warner Bros at least 4 times. The opening credits are a tribute to James Bond, really well done and performed by Celine Dion. Good performances of Domino, Rusell (the kid) and Cable.There are 2 mid-credit scenes; the second one is the best mid-credit scene of all times in cinema history.",9,7,17,17 May 2018
Ready Player One," Steven Spielberg did it again. Tribute to the 80's & 90's
","Homage to Popular Culture. What an EPIC movie; action, comedy, drama, horror, adventure. If you lived in the 80's you have to watch this. The biggest screen possible. Special FX are beautiful, visually exquisite after Avatar by James Cameron. Tons of characters from books, videogames, movies & a lot of iconic music; horror movie characters as well. You're going to desire this virtual would to exist. You'll have to watch this piece of work several times to see all the references, easter eggs & characters. OST by Alan Silvestri is awesome. This film has a good message: it's not the same to be alive as to live, OASIS might be good where you could be Superman & Fly, but it's not the real world, don't waste your whole life in the internet & social medias.In this age of bad Blockbusters, without soul, a 71-year-old Spielberg had to come to give lessons about how a good blockbuster has to be. This movie is going to be a CULT MOVIE.",9,1,6,29 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not bad at all
","The movie has MacGuffin, things when you say 'what the **** did the writers do here?'; so it's no perfect, but it's a good movie that close 9 movies and 42 years. May the force be with you.",8,4,17,6 February 2020
Justice League," It is a very funny movie with good characters that we love.
","Unlike BvS, in this all the characters have their character and  personality defined.The Flash is the nicest of all, he is the comic  relief all the time. Aquaman is like a rocker, a rebel without a cause  who is enjoying 'la vida loca' and I want to see him in his solo movie.  Cyborg is the most bitter, as it is a marginalized human-machine- alien  mix. Batman and Wonder Woman have a good chemistry, and WW is still  amazing. This is the Superman that I wanted to see in the cinema.  The aspect of the parademons is incredible, they are like a kind of  hybrid between vampires and insects and the combats with the  protagonists are spectacular. Steppenwolf is horrible, very soft,  lacked rudeness and character, in addition the CGI is bad, it seems a  badly made video game.  The CGI in Themyscira for example is terrible, but the action sequence  is impressive. The reshoots are noticeable, like the CGI to remove the  mustache to Henry Cavill.  The dialogues of the film are not very good. The story is simple and is  set for the common viewer to understand, simply 'the bad guy wants 3  mother boxes to take down the world.'  The film fix some holes in BvS. The colors of the film are really high,  they are alive and with intensity, totally different from BvS because  of what the darkness was criticized.  The film is cut, the priority of WB is obvious, and the scissors  between the action scenes is visible to the naked eye, in addition many  of the scenes of the trailers are not here.  The action is good but in the previous films it is better. OST of  #DannyElfman is forgettable, you just hear the theme of classic  superman of 1978 and Batman of 1989 (And at the beginning when it comes  in WW you hear Hans Zimmer's). The previous films were action dramas  and the change of tone of this film is action adventure and comedy  (they started the change with WW) and take the right path. It is not an  epic film but in spite of all the failures I have HOPE in this  universe. I liked it very much.  PS: the two post-credits scenes are very good.",8,275,565,15 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Pure epic and bluckbuster.
","This is Marvel's most epic film, and possibly the whole history of cinema. Dramatic, profound, with comedy, TOO EMOTIONAL, and a great final worthy and good closing for our heroes. The last minutes are an ode, ALL THE PEOPLE APPLAUDED and then the room completely silent with a lump in the throat, the tears came out and ran down my cheeks.The bar is very high for the future of cinema. I do not have the slightest doubt that it will be the highest grossing film in history, unseating Titanic, Star Wars Ep. 7 and Avatar. (Until the Lion King arrives)",9,1,3,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Good but not the best.
","The 3rd one I think is better but this is not bad at all, it just doesn't reach that level. It has good emotional moments and several ones of 'knot in the throat' in which you'll cry. I like the development of the villain (Gaby Gaby), her arc and how she evolves. The initial scene with the rain and how they tell us what happened with Bo Peep 9 years ago is GREAT. The new characters Forky, Ducky and Bunny, Duke Caboom and Giggle McDimples are great. The road that Woody has to travel and how he has to get rid of his past with Andy is very well done. The ending with Woody and Buzz Lightyear is one of the best things I've seen. 3D animation is the biggest thing that Pixar has done, there are times that even it looks real.",8,1,3,22 June 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Imminent danger.
","Drama, action, comedy & imminent danger; Visual FX & CGI are beautiful; it has great landscapes that put you in the movie; photography is pretty good; camera in hand is also immersive & gets you into conflict; it has a lot of humor, more that Marvel's previous ones (except Thor Ragnarok), also, this humor is too good, you laugh all the time with the interactions of the characters & it's set to relax from the tension & drama; the film handles the emotional aspect well in moments, i didn't feel anything in others, since they want to make you cry by repeating the same situations from previous movies in MCU; Doctor Strange has a lot of power, as well as Thor; Thor & Rocket Raccoon have good chemistry; Thanos is the best villain of MCU, terrifying & imposing, main protagonist; best film since The Winter Soldier; the Black Order is good, although inconsistent, have great powers & fight well, but when they face someone with low level, it turns out that they win them for the convenience of the script, terrible & meaningless; it feels like a 5-hour movie, but split into 2; waiting the next year for the second part.",9,1,5,27 April 2018
Aladdin," The best adaptation of Disney's live action movie
","The first act is quite slow and boring, even improbable when they are chasing Aladdin at the beginning, you do not believe the world they want to put you through the eyes and he's juggling and absurd jumps (I give it a 6), but then when the Genius appears the movie rises. Will Smith is the best of the film, Mena Massoud (Aladdin) also does his performance very well, you believe in everything, Naomi Scott (Jasmine) does her part. Those last 2 acts are great (I give it a 9). The scenes don't happen in the same order as the animated one, besides there are 38 more minutes of songs and new scenes. You don't feel that Guy Ritchie is the director, it could have been any other. This story is Arabic but they changed it and it feels a bit Indian, more of Bollywood. The ending just surprised me, it's not the same one when Aladdin sets the Genie free. You have to go watch it Noowww.",8,13,41,24 May 2019
A Quiet Place," Brilliant movie
","Great Horror, Thriller masterpiece!!!! with a little bit of drama. OMG, this movie is AMAZING. Best suspense film i've watched. Alfred Hitchcock should be scared if he was alive; better than The Sixth Sense or The Others. Sound FX are pure tension. CGI monsters are shocking. Great performances by Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Noah Jupe & Millicent Simmonds; wonderful direction & script by John Krasinski. At the end you're gonna want a second part; everybody would clap, cheer, applaud, acclaim & yell, if they weren't stupefied stuck to the seat claiming for more.",9,4,9,5 April 2018
Logan," A Serious drama with lots of action. A dark violent movie. The plot is really touching and exquisite
","A Serious drama with lots of action. A dark violent movie. The film is like Terminator 2, the machines tries to kill a little kid and someone is there to protect her; but if you want me to be sincere this is the new The Dark Knight. A really good movie, very somber, mature and realistic.The performances are great, OMG Patrick Stewart & Hugh Jackman deserve an Oscar in 2018; Dafne Keen did her part as well; the characters are well written, more humans and you feel them. It also seems like a western film.Of course it has its flats, for example the children in Mexico speaks English? That doesn't make sense; or at the beginning the tone and the pacing are slow.It Has very funny moments but sad at the same time.The plot, the script is really touching and exquisite. James Mangold made an excellent movie, his better one; the best superhero movie ever; it will be really hard for another one to be better.Good bye Hugh Jackman, good bye Wolverine & Logan, good bye Stewie.",9,0,3,2 March 2017
Joker," Good
","Good acting; direction; staging and cinematography; atmosphere; photography; and score and Original Soundtrack. But in some moments it is a bit slow and when the good thing starts, it suddenly end. There are also certain predictable parts and does not deliver anything new with the plot twist imitating Fight Club.",8,1,4,14 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It chapter 2 is not very good
","It is not bad either, at all, but leaves much to be desired in comparison to its excellent first part; his balloon deflates a lot, not so much but he floats very softly. It has some very good moments of tension l, quite raw and gore scenes, but in general it is a soothing hitter. 'It' is not a clown, it is an evil entity that takes many forms and here they do not show it as such, in the first one it was well introduced but here they were limited with the character, they are still determined to only show Pennywise and do not show their true potential. Although the performances and the actors are very good, the 'companionship' is not felt, only when there are flashbacks and they show them guys is when you notice that 'brothers' atmosphere. Many times it is not understood why an adult is going to be afraid of something that feeds on your dreams and you already know that if you are not afraid of it, nothing will happen to you (of the children if it is understood, obviously) .The problem is the script and deepened to that the long duration that does not know how to build and spin the plot well; It has some scenes of other people's shame and also forced comedy. I liked Stephen King's cameo and the turtle references for example. I also liked the reference to Nightmare on Elm Street.",6,0,0,8 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," A reboot with lots of action
","It's a different movie from the original; there is no romance with the blond girl (Brie Larson), everything happens in the island.The movie is in the 70s & every little detail is excellent (the music); the landscape is a homage to Apocalypse Now, some parts look like Predator or Alien.The characters aren't well developed since there are a lot of them; Kong (Twice as tall as the original) is the main protagonist & his fights with giant monsters/creatures.Samuel L. Jackson is a insane colonel who wants to hunt his Moby Dick (Kong) but James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) has to track him.Warner Bros wants to build this new cinematic universal.There is a post-credits scene.",8,1,4,9 March 2017
Wonder Woman," One word: WONDERful. The tape has a truly altruistic heroism & heart; Justice, freedom & hope.
","One word: WONDERful. Wonder Woman came to save the DCEU. It is a truly perfect film, a round movie from beginning to end that has its closure. It's even one of the best movies ever made. As the story goes many years before the other films doesn't need to leave loose ends or references to connect them with the rest of the universe. The origin is counted in the first half hour; in the island of Themyscira the scenes are quite colorful with a very beautiful tone, unlike what we were showing the previous films, although the plot is short and the characters don't appear much; Antiope (Robin Wright) is spectacular & Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) also does a good job. When England is shown the colors become tenuous (by the tone of the war) engaging the rest of movies; Diana (Gal Gadot) & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) make an excellent dynamic duo, with good chemistry, charisma and companionship, have a kind of romance & complicity: pure dynamite. The dynamic reminds us of Richard Donner & Christopher Reeve's Superman, the serious drama tone to Tim Burton & Michael Keaton's Batman. Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is a transitional German villain for the plot but it's necessary; Doctor Poison (Helena Anaya) works as a villain, & the final fight with the hidden villain, Ares, is good but it lasts a very short time. If Patty removes that plot, the film stands alone because Diana fighting the Germans is delightful. The tape has a truly altruistic heroism & heart; Justice, freedom & hope; What Man Of Steel should have been. Excellent action scenes, very good choreography and very good production work. The soundtrack is exciting.",9,21,42,31 May 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Just one word: Amazing
","One of the best sequels of all times; action scenes made by the own american Bruce Lee, Keanu Reeves; Jackie Chan, JetLi & Jason Statham are nobody compare to this guy; an immediate continuation of the first one, with a common thread among scenes, a continuity that explains what the other installment doesn't; it expands this mythology of the Continental Hotel, the assassins, this sect in the underworld life very different than the one we know; it still expands the good things from the first one but in another place (Rome) without repeating the same we watched before, is not a remake; there is no a funny character, has some comic moments; the character has his moral/honor code that makes us likes him because he doesn't kill for killing, if he doesn't have to kill you, he lets you leave; He has an inner suffering, typical tough hero who doesn't talk much. He isn't a superhero (but he seems), is a regural person & makes you feel that you can be him. lots of action without any cuts, many weapons, hand-to-hand fights, Jujitsu; It's not the typical movie where the bullets are always; people hurts him, It's much more credible than the rest of films of this genre. a Cassian (Common) spin-off could be made, since he follows the same method as John, behaves in the same way; the choreographies are beautiful, the production design is visually exquisite and photography is beautiful. This is La La Land for action movies. I want John Wick 3 now.",9,0,1,22 March 2019
Incredibles 2," Incredible movie
","The film starts with a great opening action scene, places 10 seconds earlier of the end of the first installment... This time Elastigirl has to work & Robert Parr is upset because 'He is Mr. Incredible', is sort of a 'male chauvinist', has his manhood & ego, but for the good of Superheroes he has to take care of his family at home, while his wife shows she is capable of doing great things to put heroes back on the game; beware, it isn't a feminazi movie, is pretty well developed & worked. There's a plot twist with the villain, takes her prisioner & every superheroe has to fight together. The interaction between Bob & his kids is fantastic. All the characters have good performance & their time on screen; Jack Jack is amazing. CGI is awesome; the details are stupendous; music is astonishing. Good sequel & has the same tone & atmosphere that connects with the first one.",8,1,2,20 June 2018
