The Blair Witch Project," My brother warned me not to watch it!
","For you 'deep thinkers' out there who believes the rest of us didn't get it, we did. It just wasn't...well...anything. There was a good idea in there somewhere, it just got lost.Irritating characters who argued for almost the entire movie. I wanted the witch to show up and kill them after 30 minutes. I would've said less time, but I had hoped it'd get better by then. And the pile of rocks...OMG! To quote Bill Murray from Ghostbusters on book stacking, 'Yeah, nothing human could've done that.'This movie is proof that critics should not review horror. Those pinheads get scared of dust bunnies, i'm sure.Avoid this movie! It's too late for me, but maybe I can save someone else from this piece of crap!",1,1,4,9 July 2006
