Hereditary," So boring Me and my friends left the cinema!!!
","OMG I can't believe people are giving this boring ass film good reviews, I would give no stars if i could.I am usually terrified of horror films, they always scare the crap out of me but this one left me mind-numbingly bored!! At no time was I even mildly frightened and the scene with the little girl and the car was hilarious!! I wasn't the only one to think the film was tedious, I have never watched a film in a cinema with so much movement. People getting up and leaving for snacks or toilet breaks, people talking and the general shifting round that people do when they are trapped somewhere and bored waiting!! Normally this sort of behaviour would drive me nuts, but it gave me something interesting to watch.I will say the acting was brilliant, and I think the film would have been much better as a drama.I haven't seen the ending but a friend has watched it and I told her how I thought it ended and surprise surprise I was right! A predicable yawn fest!!",1,1,4,19 July 2018
