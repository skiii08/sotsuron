Blade Runner 2049," Absolutely stunning film that deserves your patience..
","Yes, this is a long film without a whole lot of action. This means you should skip it if you don't have a long attention span and expect an explosion every 15 minutes.However, when you're in the right mindset and pay close attention you can see what a huge masterpiece this films is. It can suck you in and never let go. The visuals and the soundtrack are amazing. The story was very well setup in my opinion and it kept you guessing where it was going. Obviously I wanted to find out what happened to Deckard and Rachel. And while the film takes its time getting there, the twist involving K is worth it. The final act is incredibly suspenseful and I couldn't help but fight a tear at the new rendition of 'Tears in Rain'.",9,3,9,16 July 2019
Jurassic World," Great action and nostalgia, but don't think too much..
","When I read years ago that the plot for the new Jurassic Park film would include riding on dinosaurs and using them for military and covert operations I really, really wished that idea would go somewhere dark and die. What we got now with Jurassic world is a film that takes those ideas and dials them way back. This results in raptors being trained, a new dinosaur being created and bad guy (Vincent D'Onofrio's character) wanting to exploit these creatures/creations for same reason that were in that rubbish script years ago. The film wraps these pretty extreme and somewhat ridiculous elements into a nice package of dinosaur goodness in a fully functional Jurassic World with lots of nostalgic nods to the first film. That's where I think the film is at it's best. That sense of wonder and exploration is what hooked people into the first film along with the dinosaurs obviously breaking out. I just had wished this film was more about the dinosaurs instead of only the monster that is Indominus Rex and trying to take him down.The characters in the film aren't very good to say the least. There's Claire who I only found to be dumb (and slowly realizing that herself) and annoying in her journey of reconnecting with here family/nephews. The nephews themselves I didn't much care for because it was all just too obvious like most of the plot. Chris Pratt's character is the one the audience will root for, but it seems he was a little under-used and didn't get a whole lot of material aside from being the Raptor-trainer. The ending of the film is pretty damn spectacular, though, if you ask me. This, and some of the other action scenes, almost make you forget that you need great plot and characters. Rexy gets her moment to shine (I was wondering if she was going to show up) just like at the end of the first film and that final roar at the end gave me chills.Great action and nostalgia, but don't think too much..",8,7,17,29 June 2015
