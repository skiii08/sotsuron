The Blair Witch Project," Overhyped, but not overrated
","This film suffered from two things...1) By the time it hit general release it was so overhyped it was not likely to meet anybody's expectations, and 2) The creators let out that it wasn't real. Other than that, it was a great idea. It was well made. It was scary.",9,0,0,8 December 1999
