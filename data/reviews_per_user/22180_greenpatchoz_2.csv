Requiem for a Dream," The best film of the last 5 years!
","This is a powerhouse film. An honest, chilling and brilliant piece of filmmaking. Director, Aronofsky, skillfully wraps you up in the story, before delivering an deafening and intense viewing experience. You are bound to have goose bumps for days after this film. Connelly and Burstyn are absolute stand outs, and should be commended for their efforts. Requiem for a dream makes Traffic look wimpy. This is easily one of the most important and brilliant films of the last decade. Not to be missed by anyone!",10,0,1,9 January 2002
Memento," One of the most brilliantly crafted, acted and executed films of the last five years.
","Finally, a film that resonates with absolute originality. Director Chris Nolan intelligently crafts the multi layered script into a brilliant piece of film making and achieves fantastic reults friom his talented cast. You must see Memento, youll never forgive yourself if you don't.",10,0,2,4 May 2001
