First Man," Fire the director
","Great story, great acting, terrible director. Neil Armstrong would _never_ have cried on the moon. Paraphrasing a role played by Tom Hanks, 'There's no crying on the moon!' I was over the movie at the crying. My husband was over it when there was no constant radio chatter in the capsule and lander. Plus, there were too many extreme close-ups, especially of Claire Foy, and the movie dragged in spots. For great space movies that actually follow the science and culture better, see Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff. I highly recommend this movie -- but it should be watched with the ability to fast-forward.",4,0,2,5 November 2018
