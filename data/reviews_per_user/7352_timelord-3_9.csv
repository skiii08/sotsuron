Requiem for a Dream," Harrowing but incredible
","I saw an amazing film on DVD over the weekend.  I am still a bit shell shocked because it had such a profound effect on me.  I haven't seen a film like it for many years.Requiem for a Dream has to be one of the finest films I have seen for a long time.  Basically a story about drugs, it follows to storylines; one a lonely widowed mother gets invited to appear on a game show and tries to lose weight so she can fit in her 20 year old red dress; the other, her drug addled son and his friends try to crawl their way up the drug food chain to become small time dealers to make their fortune.To be sure, this film is not a pleasant experience.  Humour is hard to come by in this gritty, visceral, trippy 100 minutes.The mother resorts to diet pills to get thin, and in the process becomes addicted and starts to go slowly mad; in her fevered mind the fridge won't stop attacking her, and she is addicted to a daytime television speaker/game show host who she slowly allows into her subconsious where reality and fantasy begin to blur.Our little drug cartel starts off promisingly but after one failed deal the spiral of tragedy begins; they need to feed their own habit as well as sell the product and they are a group of 20 somethings with no self control.Director Darren Aronofsky uses every trick in the book to pull the visual feel of each scene - split screen is used to dazzlingly good effect and the sets and locations used exude a warmth that hide any possible budgetary shortcomings that I thought would be evident with this film.Ellen Burstyn plays the mother with harrowing subtly and finesse; it is easy to see why she was nominated for an Oscar for this standout performance. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly are both very good as the drug addled couple trying to make it big - they are very convincing.  The supporting role by Marlon Wayans is also very good but not given the full opportunity to shine like the other three.Requiem for a Dream is a movie that will leave a lasting effect on you.  10 out of 10.",10,0,0,19 August 2001
Memento," Gripping, absorbing film-noir
","I haven't seen a film for a long time that has kept my attention so absolutely as Memento did.  It is a superbly crafted film-noir thriller that is rivetting from beginning to end.  Or should that be from end to beginning?You see, that is what makes Memento so interesting.  It is told backwards. Guy Pearce plays a guy who suffers from short term memory loss - he can't form any lasting new memories ever since his wife was raped and killed by the mysterious Jimmy G.He keeps his life stable by writing notes on polaroids so he knows where he is staying, notes on the crime are kept in a rubber bound foldre provided by a contact within the police department.He is looking for the guy that killed his wife, Jimmy G.The structure of Memento is clever in that we share the amnesiacs fate throughout the course of the film - we see the results of actions and are as bemused as he is - it is only later we see the cause.Guy Pearce puts in a stellar performance as the afflicted avenger.  He is totally convincing and fully immersed in his role.He is ably supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss who may or may not be what they seem - are they using him to their own ends or not?Get out and see it.  A film guaranteed to please if there ever was one. It'll have you talking post-movie with your mates in such a way you haven't experienced since seeing The Usual Suspects.",10,2,2,4 April 2001
X-Men," Dumb but fun
","Well, XMen has finally hit Australian shores, and in front of a packed cinema last night we finally got to see what all the hype is about, after the trailers, the web sites and the numerous bits of gossip that have leaked out about this highly anticipated entry into the superhero franchise.It does not disappoint.  Its got something for everyone.  It has lots of backstory setting up the whole thing for three of our main characters (Rogue, Wolverine and Magneto), its got a fantastic english actor playing Magneto (McKellen), and it has plenty of action to keep the adrenaline junkies happy.As I said it does go into the backstory quite extensively for three of the leads, though it does add a richness to the whole thing that you would otherwise not think. Instead of being bored with the backstory it instead intrigues you.  They have certainly left plenty there for a sequel.  In fact, X-Men is probably the most open ended movie I have seen for quite a while.With such a relatively large cast, some characters are left underdeveloped or underused.  Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm are the notable candidates.  But in a story that focusses its energies elsewhere it is understandable that this had to happen.  I am sure they will get more to do in the next film.It does have plenty of good one liners to keep it bobbing along (my personal favourite, and one to look out for is the 'you're a dick' line).Its also over very quickly.  I am sure it went for no more than 90 minutes.  Once the climactic battle on top of the Statue of Liberty is finished you realise just how quickly the time has gone.On the negative side, the score is absolutely woeful.  Michael Kamen does just not deliver the goods in this case.  This movie called for a big majestic score to go with the impressive visuals.  What we get is some tink tink in the background with the TV Series X-Men theme thrown in once or twice for good measure.The effects are quite good (but not as good as their boast 'best special effects since The Matrix).  But they should slow down the graphical representations they use when planning their battles, they often flowed by and you couldn't make out what the hell they were looking at.X-Men promises and delivers.  It is big, dumb fun that will please the entire audience.  I am certainly looking forward to more entries in this particular franchise.

American Psycho," Read the book first
","Now, I haven't read the Bret Easton Ellis novel on which this film is based. I thought I should get that right out in the open to start with.  Because many of you may wish to stop reading this review right now, because I didn't really like American Psycho, but I somehow think that would be different if Ihad read the book first.This film has been out for a week or so now; even earlier if you caught it at the various film festivals around the country.  I rose out my lethargy to write a review of this film after reading Malcolm Knox's excellent article on the book and film in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald Spectrum liftout.  Dig it out and have a read, it is quite interesting.Anyway, as I said, the book looks like it might be a pre-requisite for not only viewing, but enjoying this rather black thriller/comedy.  It uses the old Kubrick standby of making lots of things very white and contrasted, the direct opposite to what is being portrayed in the film.So what do we have?  We have a yuppie, Patrick Bateman, going quietly mad with all the corporate life swimming around him.  And he just snaps and starts killing people.  Or does he?The beauty of this film is that the ambiguity over the deaths is left right until the end, to allow the viewer the chance to fully wallow in the murderous spree Bateman revels in, without the distraction of thinking 'now did that happen or not?'.To give him his worth, Christian Bale is quite good as the killer; a well mannered, precise kind of 80's music loving guy who suddenly starts having a lot of bad days.He typifies in all of us perhaps what we would like to do in real life.  Who can honestly say that at some point in their lives they haven't wanted to kill a work colleague?  Without getting too much into Monty Python territory here I will leave it at that.As I said, I truly believe an appreciation of the book is important to the enjoyment of this film, even if you just read some well researched reviews of it first.  Check out the SMH one, it is great!6 out of 10.",6,1,2,13 August 2000
U-571," 10 out of 10, it's that good
","It isn't often you enter a cinema and instead of checking your watch you have to check a calendar instead.  Now that doensn't mean U-571 was even more boring than usual, it just means I had to make sure I wasn't in the 50's or 60's watching a film, so effective is this flick in transporting the viewer back to the era of war films, espionage, Cold War shennanigans and so forth.The plot concerns the retrieval of the Enigma machine, a small typewriter like device that German U-boats used to communicate, using an encryption that the Allies had failed to crack.  Upon hearing that a U-Boat lies crippled after a blistering attack, the Americans disguise one of their own subs as a german u-boat, and attempt to get to the german sub before the enemy can send their own resupply and repair ship to aid the distressed tub.Their goal is to grab the machine and scupper the ship before the repair ship gets there.  Of course it wouldn't be a film of this nature without the whole thing going wrong, and some of the crew end up on the German U-Boat, fighting for their lives to get home with the precious 'typewriter'.U-571 is quite simply an excellent film, full of suspense and excitement. The cast are totally top-drawer, with McConaughey giving what is probably the performance of his career, in a role that seems tailor made for him. After years of floundering around with horrible roles that demanded little of him, this film allows McConaughey the scope and range he needs, and he does not disappoint.The special effects are also very well done, with some fantastic underwater photography and digital hokery-pokery adding to the suspensful moments very well.This one is a definite must for the big screen.  Make sure you find a cinema with the biggest speakers possible, cause those depth charges sure sound great!10 out of 10.  It's that good.",10,4,17,25 April 2000

The Transporter," Tongue in cheek and proud of it
","Took advantage of tightarse Tuesday and went and saw The Transporter this evening.Interesting film - reminded me a lot of 'The Big Hit' - stylised action and fight scenes mixed in with a lot of tongue in cheek humour.  The Transporter didn't go the extremes that 'The Big Hit' did but it was heading there.  It even shared a similar theme of the tough guy falling for the Asian school-age girl.The audience I saw the film with were sniggering at some of the more implausable things (the leap of the car onto the car trailer for one).The fight scene in the bus depot with the slippery oil was inventive.Can't help feeling that Jason Statham was a bit miscast for the role of the super efficient Transporter, the guy you hire when you have to get a package from point a to point b.  Writer Luc Besson has a long history of projects concerning loners (La Femme Nikita, Leon, heck, even Joan of Arc) and Statham doesn't fully succeed in pulling off the role.  He's great in the action sequences but anything else he seems to fall into familiar territory that his old mate Guy Ritchie trained him in for Lock Stock, and Snatch.The final chase between the Transporter and container lorries did seem to steal a lot from the Bond flick 'Licence to Kill' (taking over lorries, jumping from planes onto backs of lorries etc), but it did add enough wrinkles to stamp its own signature on the scenes.Good film though - great action sequences and inventive locations.  8 out of 10.",8,0,0,5 November 2002
Any Given Sunday," Style over simplistic content
","The latest directorial outing from Oliver Stone (who last helmed 'U-Turn'), 'Any Given Sunday' is an in-your-face movie which does not let up at all for its near 3 hour length.At its heart it is a very simple story, but Oliver uses his trademarks 'smoke and mirrors' technique of different film stocks, jerky camera angles and pseudo-vintage footage to mask this.What we have one one side is a story about a washed up quarterback, and the washed-up coach who still believes in him and holds onto the values and beliefs of the 'old school'.On the other side we have the rising star of a black athlete and the ambitious daughter of the former manager who rules the club with an iron fist, willing to use anyone and anything to further her own ambitions.Warning - do not see this film if you do not like Gridiron, or don't understand the rules of the game.  It has definately been styled for American audiences, familiar with the game and its undoutedly complex rules. Coupled with the fact that three quarters of the film is a football match, and you really need to like or appreciate the game to get a handle on this film.As I said, the flashy camera tricks to hide what is a relatively simple story.  And that is probably its biggest failing, in that it is more style over content.  Add on the thumping soundtrack (which must surely translate to a 5-CD soundtrack issue when the time comes) and its gloss is a little tarnished by its lack of meat.6.5 out of 10.",7,0,0,24 July 2000
High Fidelity," Not as good as I thought it was gonna be
","'The movie ain't about geography', or so I read in an interview with Nick Hornby recently, commenting about how the movie version of his book has been transposed from London to Chicago.  There were cries of 'it won't be the same!', but High Fidelity does not suffer at all in the transition to the backwaters of this particular American city.High Fidelity is primarily about Rob (John Cusack), a music fanatic and record store owner who embarks on a spiritual journey to find out from his five former loves what exactly it is about him that precludes a long lasting and meaningful relationship.We are introduced to these former flames via the movies use of 'Top 5' lists - in this case the 'Top 5 All Time Rejection List'.  The pursuit of the entries on this list forms the backbone of the movie, against which the characters interact.The other main players are the introverted and extroverted pair of fellow record store employees, Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black).  Both are great foils for Rob, to me portraying the alternating sides of Rob's personality.  On the one side is his desire to be a a popular ladies man, and on the other side is his quiet nature, spending time cataloguing his record collection and making complilation tapes for friends.High Fidelity uses the technique of having the main character Rob talk directly to the audience.  This is not only used, it is used a *lot*.  If you don't like that sort of address straight to the audience, you will not like High Fidelity.  Most of the time it works, but after a while you just want him to shut the hell up.The soundtrack of course is a standout, trawling the 60s thru 80s for its gems.  Well worth a listen.I was a little disappointed with this movie.  It didn't seem to 'click' as much as I thought it would and should have.  Cusack is probably a bit miscast; too much of the trademark Cusack pauses and pouty lips get in the way of good characterisation.  Having said that it was still good entertainment, although it was perhaps about 20 minutes too long.  The end part with the band CD premiere and the tacky 'store employee in supposedly crappy band turns out to be really good after all' bits did break the flow and appeared tacked on.Good entertainment helped by a great soundtrack and solid support performances.7 out of 10.",8,0,1,29 August 2000
