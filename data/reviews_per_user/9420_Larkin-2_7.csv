Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," HORRIBLE!!
","Both boring and dull!Did anyone actually like this movie?  The writing was dull, the acting was horrible, and the movie itself was just bad. I guess the only thing good about it was Jar Jar Binks.  George Lukas did mild directing in this.  I mean, come on! The actors had no motivation in them.  The only good acting in it was done by Anikin's mother.  And did anyone catch the fact that he is Darth Vader?  The movie was incredibly slow to begin with and the ending was long and unbelievably boring!  If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't bother at all!!!!!!!",Null,0,1,21 August 1999
Spice World," Boring but cute!
","Ok.This movie was all right I guess.  When I went to the theater to go see it, I felt like walking out a couple of times, but if you like their music and some pretty silly things then this is your movie.The music was top rate, but the acting combined with the movie itself, was well, pretty bad.  If you ever saw the movie Harriet the Spy, well, this is pretty much the same kind of thing.  It's like following somebody, or, somebody(s) in this case, around for a few days, and seeing what they do.  It's just really lame. As a fan of the Spice Girls I was very disappointed with it.But as I say again, the music was just terrific, so check it out, you might actually like it!",Null,0,0,22 August 1999
The Mummy," Horrible!!!!!
","I thought this movie Stank!!This movie was truly horrible.  The special effects were really good, and the acting was terrific, but the movie itself just reeked!It was like the bringing back of the dead, and they tried to make it almost funny, but it really wasn't.  It was sick and twisted!Not one of Brendan Fraser's better movies, but he was really good!!!He was like Indiana Jones in a way.I hope you enjoy this movie, because I sure didn't!!",Null,0,0,27 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," Hilarious!!
","Outstanding movie making!!I absolutely loved it! Based on  Shakespere's play, The Taming of the Shrew, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, is the modern day teenage version of it.  Taming of the Shrew is also an old Elizabeth Taylor movie  which was done in the early to mid 60's which I found to be very well done.
My favorite in the whole thing was Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Cameron James)!  He was so cute, sweet, and just all around perfect!The two reasons why I wanted to see this movie was because of Larisa Oleynic (Bianca Stratford), and Andrew Keegan (Joey Donner).  I was very disappointed with Larisa, but on the other hand, very impressed with Andrew's acting.Joey Donner is the so called Pawn in the movie.  A stupid self absorbed rich Loser, pays Verona to go out with Kat so that he can go out with her sister, Bianca.Cameron James is the quiet guy who is madly in love with Bianca. He is the actual brains to the operation of having Joey pay. Along with his side kick Michael.I fell in love with all the characters except for Bianca's. Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) had to be the best of them all, even though they are all amazingly unique in many different ways. She is truely the  funniest, most sarcastic and she simply is hilarious!Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger) could actually be cute if it weren't for his stupid hair cut (Which by the way Kat mentions in her 10 things I hate about you poem.)!David Krumholtz (Michael Eckman) who I recognized from other movies such as, Life with Mikey, The Santa Clause, Addams Family Values, was rather silly in this movie. He was clever I must say in this movie, and he did have some very funny lines too!The movie in itself, was extraodinarily good, and in my book it deserves a ten, hence the name 10 things I hate about you.This movie has wit, charm, humor, romance, and at the end of the movie it has out-takes.It is filmed in Seattle, and at the end of the movie during the credits, the band Letters to Cleo, play on the top of the school, singing I WANT YOU TO WANT ME, originally preformed by Cheap Trick.Please watch this movie if you like teenage romance comedies!",Null,0,0,21 August 1999
Scream 2," Really Bad!!
","This movie doesn't even compare to the first one!This movie stank big time!! I mean come on it was almost like they had to make the sequel just because. The characters were dull and the premise was really bad!! The whole thing was gyp! If you ask me the first one was a lot better. A whole lot better!! I absolutely adored the first one!!You might like it, but I will tell you that the ending was stupid and forced, and Jada Picket-Smith is a horrible actress in this movie!Check it out though- you might like it.... :>",Null,0,0,24 August 1999
The Waterboy," Stupid!!
","This movie is truly Adam Sandler's worst movie ever!!When I went to the theater to see this with a group of my friends, I just stared at the screen thinking to myself, 'Does this movie have a purpose at all?'  I finally got so bored I started throwing popcorn at some of my friends! They all loved it, but I just thought it was the stupidest thing ever.  All I have to say is that THE FONZ, is a geek in it!  This movie was truly terrible!!Please, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie!!!",Null,2,3,22 August 1999
Scream," One of the best movies ever made!!!
","Excellent movie!I absolutely loved this movie!! My favorite horror!  I thought it was Drew Barrymore's best work ever!  Neve Campbell's o.k.  she doesn't compare at all to Jennifer Love Hewitt, but she's still good for her part. And of course my love Matthew Lillard does an outstanding job in it!  I mean who else could of done a role like that? This movie combines chills and thrills with outstanding comedy!! My favorite parts are when they're at the party and Neve's boyfriend shows up, and when they're at the video store! Enjoy this movie it rocks big time! If you haven't seen it, and you like horrors, this is the one to watch!",Null,0,0,21 August 1999
