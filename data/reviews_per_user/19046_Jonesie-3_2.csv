Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The impossible task of making a movie everyone would like!
","It was going to be almost impossible to film a prequel to the Star Wars trilogy that every one liked.  However, this is an admirable job.  The special effects are superb, but the characterisations a little underdone - like Return of the Jedi. The plot is fine, but slows down a little in the middle. The irritating 90's need to have silly jokes in the midst of serious action crops-up again, particularly the floppy-eared fellow who is badly overdone. Neeson is a little dispassionate, but the rest of the cast are good, especially McGregor who slots straight into the role of Obi-Wan. But the underlying theme is the continuation of the Star Wars universe. This was the most important thing and it sets up the scene for the next one nicely.  The next one will be spectacular.",6,0,1,21 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The middle chapter is always the best!!!
","Lucas returns to the real world!  What a way to come back with possibly the second best Star Wars film of them all (after Empire). Empire's darkness returns as does the more varied pace and non formula plot. The sweeping, all conquering music score is back once more after a weakish 1st episode.  Christensen is superb as Anakin, if limited by an overall simplistic dialogue.  There's a dangerous, sinister undercurrent beneath the good looks, which makes the closing scene all the more unsettling.  We know where they're heading, but they don't.  Yet!  Portman and McGregor can't quite rise above the material, lacking the dynamism of Christensen.  Two much CGI in places, and the Coruscant scene is a little overlong and far-fetched.  But the battles are first class, particularly the closing conflict.  And Christopher Lee is supreme as Dooku.  Never has an actor belied his age (almost 80) to such an extent.  Roll on part 3, but do we have to wait three years? And George: Make a final trilogy!  You'll see it in your dreams!",9,0,0,22 May 2002
