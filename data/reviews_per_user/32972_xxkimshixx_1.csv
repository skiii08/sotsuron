Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Why does everyone think this is such a great movie?
","I just watched this movie and I have to say that it was not that funny...at all. Borat had some funny comments here and there, but overall I would classify it as dumb humor. I was actually getting irritated because Borat tried so hard to be outrageous and funny. I was definitely disappointed because I thought I was going to laugh so hard, but I only chuckled here and there. I guess I should have known it wasn't going to be that great because the actor who plays Borat is actually Ali G, but I didn't realize that at the time. I wish I didn't have to pay the movie ticket price, but I wouldn't mind getting this as a movie rental.",6,6,11,3 January 2007
