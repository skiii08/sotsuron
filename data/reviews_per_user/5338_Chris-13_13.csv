The Blair Witch Project," A Blair Witch Analyze
","The problem with The Blair Witch Project is in relation with the story. Some things are unknown. Who found the footage of the young students? The police? Their parents? The firemen? The witch??? Who stole Josh??? This movie leaves us to indecision, to mystery with no answers. Maybe I'm a bad movie viewer.
But, the film have his originality. Entirely shot with an handycam, it's good, like a real documentary with friends. This movie give us some ideas to do an own sequel: The Blair Witch Project 2: The Story of the People who found the footage. Coming to your cinema near you soon...I can't vote for this movie",Null,0,1,30 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The movie of the year, of a life
","To be honest with The Phantom Menace, don't compare to the Star Wars trilogy. It's another thing. Much more special effects, a different style. Maybe a little bit technologic for a story 30 years before another.Good things: The cast is excellent and the performances are great. Some surprises are on. The final battle with the music Duel of the Fates. The F/X are great but a little too much. Podrace!!!Bad things: Maybe too much F/X. The character of Darth Maul is not develop as much as Darth Vader was. Jar-Jar Binks is a little bit annoying.It's a movie to see and to see and to see.The movie of the year and the movie of a lifetime. Can't wait for Episode II.9 out of 10",5,0,0,20 May 1999
Fight Club," Pure Fincher, pure madness, pure ending!!!
","I don't believe this movie. How great he is. How spectacular he is. How mysterious he is. The movie is made by David Fincher, one of the great director of the decade. He made is mark in the cinema with is famous twist-in-the-end. He have the touch, the touch of how to make a terrific. And the performances of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are awesome. It's a completely psycho movie. But it's a movie to see.My vote: 9 out of 10",9,0,1,9 December 1999
Blade," Blade vs. Frost: Action and Thrill
","It's a great action movie, maybe the best of the summer. Wesley Snipes have the physic of the job and he do it well. Stephen Dorff is good as the evil Frost. This combinations give a big movie for entertainment. The techno music go nicely with the rhythm of the fight. I wish to see a sequel one day...",Null,0,1,29 August 1998
Sleepy Hollow," The real Burton
","Tim Burton is back with a great movie. It's exciting and terrific. All of the Burton's directing are specials and Sleepy Hollow don't do exception to the rule. It's beautiful and mysterious... Johnny Depp is great in the role of Ichabod Crane. Maybe the best performance of Johnny Depp since a long, long time. The movie combined horror, romance, comedy and action. I think it's one of the best movie of the year, just for the directing, it's wonderful. I will return watch it!!!! Go for it!",8,0,0,21 November 1999
The Beach," Great adventure
","I see The Beach last night and I love it. It's a very special movie, with great images and actors performances. This film is unique by his photography and direction. Leonardo DiCaprio is not only a sexy actor for the girls, but he is a very actor and it's fun to see him play a character like that.Go see this movie now...8 out of 10",8,0,0,12 February 2000
BASEketball," Same joke
","It's a not comic comedy. When the players trying confuse their opponents, we see a joke, but we see the same joke all the time. 'I sleep with your sister!!!'. So, I think the jokes were boring and stupid. Also, the actors performances are bad enough for them to win some Razzies Awards. I think Matt Stone is the only one who has a little potential then became 1/5 of Jim Carrey. So, I believe that the South Park creators have to work on South Park and only South Park for a long time to have a real success.3 out of 10 and I'm so generous.",Null,3,7,22 February 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Saving is great
",What a great movie it was. I see it this afternoon and I have comment: Spielberg can do anything and anything he do is great and spectacular. 4 stars out of 4.,10,0,0,29 July 1998
Mission: Impossible II," Another stupid love story
","M:I-2 is an average action movie with some great action sequence. The subject is not bad but the screenplay is bad with a non sense and stupid love story. Tom Cruise is still great but not at his best. The end is like a movie like Stepmom or You've Got Mail. Too previsible at some moments, especially the sequences with the mask. Anthony Hopkins have a too little part in the movie and it's also ordinary.Go see it, but...5 out of 10",Null,0,0,8 June 2000
Titanic," Movie of the year
","Yes, it's the best movie of 1997. Great special effects, great actor direction, great actors, great..., great...., When a movie combine comedy, action, romance and spectacular effects, it's a blockbuster.",10,6,13,29 July 1998
The Waterboy," Go for it!!!
","Adam Sandler takes brightly the step to became a great challenger to Jim Carrey. He gives a good COMIC performance for a sympathetic movie. Some people want to see an Oscar performance by Sandler. Ha! Ha! If it's not, they dislike the movie. The Waterboy is the movie for which reason cinema is made: entertainment!!!! And which movie the people go seeing this time? The Waterboy.Let's go Adam!!!!",Null,1,1,15 November 1998
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best of all
","Star Wars is a cult movie. Star Wars is one of the rare movies you could see three times in a day, and the next day, and the day after. Star Wars is the masterpiece of the 20th Century. The appointment of all people, from young to old, from movie fan to not movie fan. Star Wars is the reference of all sci-fi movies. Star Wars is for you.A must see, and see and see and see.",10,0,0,20 December 1998
Gladiator," An high quality picture
","This movie is very excellent on the visual side. The images are great and the directing is awesome. In acting, I was impressed by Joaquin Phoenix in the role of the evil Commodus. He is really evil. Russell Crowe as the physic to prove his talent. And it's very great to see the old Richard Harris in a comeback.A great epic!!!9 out of 10",9,1,1,5 May 2000
