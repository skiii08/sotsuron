Alien 3," A very realistic portray of what may be out there....
","First, I've got to say that this movie deserves more credit than it received.  David Fincher did a great job of directing.  The cast was superb as well...the well-known Sigourney Weaver of course, Charles Dance, Charles Dutton, and Danny Webb.  Weaver came back as the intrepid Ripley and did a spectacular of of it too.  Charles Dance came in as the lonely medic on the far-flung prison colony, Charles Dutton portrayed the role of the courageous and leader prisoner Dillon, while Danny Webb backed up the cast the only survivor of the ordeal playing the role of prisoner Morse. The main thing that got me about this movie was the frighteningly realistic storyline.  It all makes perfect sense.  In the first two Alien movies, the humans had a means of defense. In 'Alien', the characters had flame-throwers for their weapons.  In 'Aliens', all and I mean ALL of the characters had a weapons: there was the M41-A Pulse Rifle, the M56 Smart Gun, the M240 Flame-thrower, H&K VP70 9mm sidearm, and the infamous M40 Grenades for the Pulse Rifle.  But in 'Alien 3', there is no weapons...therefore the story is more suspenseful.  Ripley awakens after having her cryo-tube and her fellow other survivors blasted out of the U.S.S. Sulaco ship from part 2 on this prison planet called 'Fiorina 161' out at the ass-end of space.  Dead prisoners begin to mount up and she finds out that a new form of alien has gotten loose on the planet.  But this time, there is no fancy sophisticated weaponry to fight back with!Lt. Ellen Ripley: 1st Class/#36706, must lead the last remaining prisoners into battle with no weapons or modern technology of any kind. In the process, Ripley discovers something about herself that she cannot stop: the Queen alien inside of her.  The Weyland-Yutani Corporation (the 'Company'), want to have Ripley quarantined until their arrival.  They just want the alien for their bio-weapons division. But Ripley knows that if it gets off the planet: it will kill everything.  In the end there is a final showdown between her and the alien and Ripley must destroy herself in order to save so many others.But if you know the 'Alien' storyline like I do: then you'll know that Ripley's death didn't thwart anything back on Earth......",Null,0,3,1 August 1999
Alien 3," Ripley thought she wiped them out, but she was wrong...
","Ripley in my opinion is the greatest female action hero around. Everything from fighting onboard a huge M-Class Star-freighter to slaughtering a bunch of bugs on a colony and even blowing the Queen Alien out an airlock, Ripley really knows how to be in charge and take action against threats!  Anyway, I think this film deserves more credit than it actually got.  The low and eerie music was okay, the characters and storyline rocked, and the action was good.  The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that there wasn't any guns or weapons.  But after all, Ripley supposedly crashes on a prison planet with no weapons or modern technology of any kind.  That pretty much bites when fighting these things.  With the new special effects technology, the alien was very well designed and laid out.Not to mention the action in this film was pretty well acted out when everyone was supposed to be fighting.  I think the characters did very well fighting against a nasty predator like that with no guns.  David Fincher did a great directing job on this film (just like he did on all his other films).  The film itself keeps you enthralled from the start to the middle and finally to its surprising climax.  I mean who would think that the main character himself or herself would perish in the end like that. I thought that was pretty lame but the story had to come to a close sometime I guess. In the story line, Ripley was basically saving the world by jumping into that furnace because she found out she had a Queen embryo inside of her and she knew that if that thing got off the planet, it would kill everything. But overall, this film really did it for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Null,0,3,11 May 1999
