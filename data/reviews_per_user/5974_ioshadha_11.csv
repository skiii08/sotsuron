The Avengers," Liked everything about the movie except the last scene
","Liked everything about the movie except the last scene... How Ironman happened to somehow fall through the portal before it closes... Too much of a coincident for a movie that has justification/reasoning for the entire story line...Should have been a more convincing way that Ironman saves himself or by someone else... Feels like the ending was rushed. I also expected little more action from Thor.. but then again, that's not a huge miss. Captain America's character should have been little move active as well..Other than that... this is how marvel movies should be made !!!",9,3,9,13 May 2012
Captain Marvel," Nothing Great, But Satisfying !!!
","For starters, MCU version of Captain Marvel is very much an altered version of the confusing comic history of Captain Marvel / Miss Marvel. Unlike most other MCU characters Captain Marvel does not have a one clear origin story... More you dig, more you can get confused. Who is Captain Mar-Vell, how Mar-Vell get super powers because he is a Kree etc etc,... and how Carol Danvers related to Mar-Vell etc etc,... But MCU decided to make it all very simple so it fits the current MCU (universe) which I think is a good decision and an worthwhile effort.Movie itself is positioned right before the End Game... Meaning fans will rush to see Captain Marvel to see how she fits in to the MCU story line regardless its good or bad. For most parts the movie is fun and enjoyable. Its not as intensive or has a deeper meaning to it like the Infinity War or some of the earlier MCU movies. So, based on the fact that this movie comes right before the End Game I guess Marvel Studios took the opportunity to make Captain Marvel a fun and lite movie and saving energy to construct the End Game. At least that my theory.I don't think Captain Marvel is as bad as some reviewers are sounding here. You also needs to look at each of MCU movie from its own perspective and not all movie can be constructed the same way. I mean look at Black Panter... it took a completely different turn in my opinion and for me its less fun and enjoyable than Captain Marvel.Anyways, all and all Captain Marvel is good enough... and it takes a couple of movies or so to build a good character that fits the rest of the MCU. As the first Solo movie of Captain Marvel I think its not bad... but it could have been little better !!!",7,1,4,21 March 2019
Aquaman," $1B Box Office, Reminds me of Black Panther
","Aquaman movie in DC universe reminds me of Black Panther in MCU. High Box office number for a flashy movie. The issue is however if you are a true comic fan you will walk a way with mix feelings.I'm don't know DC as much as I know Marvel but I had few obvious problems with the movie.. Big one was the power ranger costumes of Atlatis and then somewhat subpar script and acting. To be honest I would rate Justice League more than Aquaman any day.. At least Justice league carried more DC essence in the movie. You can clearly see that Aquaman is made for better entertainment experience than focusing on DC attributes. Somewhat similar to recent Thor Ragnarok, Black Panter etc in MCU where they were really pop cone movies made for general audiences to talk away with a relaxed feeling.End of the day studios need to make $$ and this movie is made to do just that. DC's darker attributes didn't work so well to attract a larger audience in any recent movies. You can't achieve big box office numbers by trying to impress the comic fan base. You need everyone to watch the movie. So, for that you need a movie with good CGI, flashy story line (not necessarily a good script), good action and happy ending.I rate Aquaman 6.5. It is watchable and entertaining at most parts... But then as a comic fan I walk away little disappointed.",6,0,0,9 February 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Guardians of the Galaxy Attempt - Failed
","This is a Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy attempt that failed big time. If you are a Marvel fan and know the comics right this movie is an utter disgrace to the Thor character - I agree with every reviewer who stated that. I can't figure why Marvel drag this movie in the direction of a comedy - comedy carrier away big time.I'm also surprise by the IMDB 8+ rating on this... Perhaps its the same Guardians of the Galaxy audience that enjoy lite and fun movies who aren't necessarily Marvel fans either. So, you can easily see how people who voted this movie are in two opinions, either very low rating for this movie being an unbearable comedy or high rating for being nothing but a fun superhero movie. I had high expectations but walking away very disappointed. This movie had great potential for that budget and time spent...Marvel - Hoping your studios don't get carried away and side track from making good Marvel movies. There is no need of more comedy in any Marvel movies than what is there today. If not anything you need a little bit of more seriousness added to the movies.My Rating 6.5 at best.",6,4,7,28 January 2018
Pacific Rim," Waited for a such long time
","Finally, a monster/alien movie that you can really enjoy !!! I waited for something like this on the big screen for such long time.It felt like when I watched independence day back in 1996 although from today's standards a 1996 movie is a bit hard to compare the feeling was pretty similar. Earth's last hope and survival if human kind - it was all there. There is something grand about these types of movies.Making a movie of a historic event or a great character lived and getting it right is one thing... Making a movie of a monster/alien and getting things right is another. Yes, this type of movie is not everyone's cup of tea but even so I'm sure the most dramatics minded person would appreciate the CGI. CGI was breath taking for starters. This movie also amazed me with the plot. The story line was near perfect for a movie of this gender - it was unique too. There weren't any plot holes, There weren't any unexplained moments, it had fun in it - not over the top nor carried away, acting was great I thought. It was all full of action, thrill and adventure !!!One thing I did not get was that about 4 or 6 helicopters being able to carry a Jaeger??? Well that didn't work for me. But the rest of 98% movie did.",9,3,5,6 October 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," A good effort
","I think most reviewers have underrated this movie. Remember, Captain America, Thor, Iron man, Hulk and all of Avengers are all Marvel comics... they are all comic books... and bringing these characters to real life on the big screen satisfying every viewer's expectations are not an easy task. I would have expected a little more from all of these movies if they were supposed to be standalone. But from the point of view of forming the upcoming The Avenger I think all of these movies have done very well. In this regard I thought Thor was done the best.Did I enjoy Captain America? Yes, I did... Do I feel it could have been little better - I sort of do. Captain America feels a little rushed... although I don't blame the makers of the movie because there is too much detail that needed to be emphasis in that short period of the movie all the way from being Steve Rogers to present day Captain America.All in all I feel it is a good effort for a Marvel comic series. Do yourself a favor - don't expect a 'The Shawshank Redemption' from any Marvel comic movie - if you do, just don't watch marvel comics ;)",8,3,7,9 August 2011
Justice League," The Problem is the Audience
","Let's get started on this topic by giving a rating of 8 for Justice League.... It's not perfect by any means, but for me as a true DC/Marvel comic fan I appreciate Justice League more than say the most recent Marvel's Thor - Rangrong which in my opinion was a big joke and a comedy than anything else. If you ask most people (the general audience) however, see this the other way around and this is why - Let's get the obvious out of the way first... Justice League as I mentioned, by no means perfect. As many have indicated the plot and some character development could have been better... what Justice League needed in my opinion is more screen time. The movie seriously lacked screen time to bring a group six superhero characters together therefore affecting the whole flow and the plot of the movie... But the movie manged to maintain true DC essence in it to a degree. DC differ from Marvel from being more dark and twisted in their stories...Justice League in many ways maintained what DC is all about. Many 
(the general audience) would see this as being boring or non entertaining but if you know DC then you know what you are up against. Batman vs Superman had a similar tone to Justice League... again many criticized that movie too.The problem here come down to the blockbuster earnings. Marvel has been making some healthy $$ figures on recent movies like the whole Avengers series and other solo movies such as Iron Man. Studios don't care about maintaining the original essence of DC or Marvel comics... for them the the success lies in the $$ figure. So, how do they earn more $$s? Well the answer is of course developing movies to capture a wider audience than the true DC/Marvel comics fan base out there... My friend rated more recent Guidance of the Galaxy and Thor - Rangrong very high... I asked him why. His view was simple - it fun, lite and great entertainment with some hardcore CGI - you walk out of the theater happy... nothing wrong with his view... but he has no clue whatsoever what DC or Marvel comics are all about - have never read them. He would easily mixed up Marvel and DC characters. And that's the general audience I'm talking about... And this is how Thor - Rangrong gets its high ratings and blockbuster $$s.By this definition Marvel by default has the edge when it comes to entertainment as Marvel comics have more fun/brighter element in the original comics in comparison to DC. Iron Man's and the Guidance of the Galaxy success were around these elements - Audience like this. However, studios try to apply the same theme across on movies such as Thor - Rangrong which in my opinion led to jeopardizing the Thor character to a comedy which was disgrace and ended up in a disaster regardless of it successful blockbuster earnings. Only a Marvel fan would see this but no the general audience. You can see how ratings on Thor - Rangrong go either very high (general audience) vs very low (Marvel fans).So, this my take on how DC and Marvel movies will continue to the future... Studios will try to make more $$s. Marvel was first in this game... they sort of got the formula right making more $$s by focusing on entertainment than maintaining the true essence of the original comics. DC will follow the lead at a certain point. Its going to be interesting to see how DC does this if they wanted to maintain the dark and twisted nature of DC comics which is what differentiate DC from Marvel. The end result however, is that Marvel and DC movies will gradually loose the true essence of the original comics and what they were all about.",8,1,1,5 March 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," No Direction and Messy
","I expected this movie to top the avengers and I have to say I'm disappointed. I'm a fan of Marvel and DC comics and I embrace the movies whenever I can... but this one didn't do it for me. Specially, being the next in line of the Avengers. 7/10 was little too generous of me - it was for the CGI and for scale of the movie.I remember walking out of the theatre after Avengers... Felt satisfies, grand and grateful for all the efforts put in making the film specially, the wonderful story line which was well connected from the beginning to the end. Avengers made me and lot of us wanting more from Marvel. But Age of Ultron was somewhat the opposite of all of the above I have to say.In Ultron, the story from the start to end was not well connected, kinda messy and felt sudden at times. Rather than letting the movie unwrap the story and its characters the script tried to forced things it wanted to tell the audience. Felt more like a check list. The character I enjoy the most was Ultron. The rest of the cast did a good job but I think the direction of the movie and the script didn't do much justice... The jokes were one the dull end too.Overall, although you could still enjoy the movie for its actions and CGI, its nothing like the Avengers. Its messy... You can't help thinking that this time around Joss Whedon lose the grip somewhat. And I really hope the next one will live up for the standards of the Avengers.",7,4,10,11 September 2015
Avatar," I'll talk about ratings
","Many have commented about the movie, I'll talk about ratings !!! I usually don't bother voting just any movie... I didn't vote Harry Potter (no means it's a bad movie) but I voted District 9. I was excited about rating this movie from the very beginning, when I first heard about it... Now I finally watched it, I gave a lot of thought before I made my vote.To me a movie to be considered great firstly, it should be realistic enough in its own nature (doesn't matter it is a movie about an alien or something), the story line should make perfect sense – everything should add up at the end, emotional, the concept should be original and finally the movie should be free of 'the good guy never hits by a bullet, only the bad guys do'. When I'm watching a movie I like to live in it and be a part...and for the next few days, I like to figure out that those parts of the movie that aren't meant to be too obvious at first. Avatar had all the ticks... On top of this CGI was amazing... no doubt among the best I have seen, the best I have seen in a movie (consider the length of the movie and CGI is almost all what you see) great work !!! .So, just to make sure I do my rating business right I when through IMDb top 250... and then worldwide box office. I visualized these top movies I have watched and compared them with Avatar...And this is what I thought...Overall, I thought Avatar is a definite 9 nothing less but not a 10 only because the story line was somehow quite predictable !!! I sort of figured out the story just by watching the trailers but let me tell you this, Avatar is directed so well you almost forget about what's going to happened in the end... when you watch it you live by the moment...Okay, because I'm talking about ratings here there is something I need to mention which I don't quite understand... I checked the percentage of different ratings made for this movie. I was shocked !!! because some have voted this movie as low as 1 or 2. I don't understand why anyone would vote such a great movie anything below 7... Ridicules, I have to say... Well, I have one theory as to why this might have happened. Maybe these people were confused, and chose not to wear the cheap looking sunglasses given at the entrance to the movie. Hmm... that would explain it wouldn't it!!!",10,4,8,16 January 2010
Prometheus," Interesting movie but there is good and bad
","There is the good and the bad... I rate this 8 because Prometheus definitely isn't your average alien kind of movie. It has a much more deeper meaning to it, but it is hard to say whether it is exactly focus towards the audience who enjoy a movie with a theme 'who are we, where we come from' or whether it is one of those rare good alien movies. Which direction the story will head towards will be more clearer in the coming sequence of Prometheus (hopefully)...If you are into Prometheus type of sci-fi movies, once you watch Prometheus it leaves more questions than answers. It is one of those movies that make you think and read reviews afterwards :) yes, I did. In that sense it was a great story line but at the same time it leaves you unsatisfied because you don't find answers to the original question Prometheus poses 'who are we, where we come from etc,.' I think the plot should have been more cleaner. Unless you are in to sci-fi movies it is easy for one to get totally lost in the story line as well. In general, I think characters also had little time to develop in the story line. And the result/mutation of whoever come in contact with that black 'Bio-form/liquid' was not so logical. What was David the android's purpose of infecting Charlie? So ,yea how well all these things will be explained in Prometheus 2 or in the coming sequences of the movie are yet to be seen... So, Prometheus success will (depend) need to be backed by the sequence. All and all it is a rare and indeed an intriguing movie. I hope Prometheus 2 will come out soon enough.",8,0,7,16 June 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Should you believe the critics?
","Answer is NO,. do not believe those critics.There is plenty of reviews here to read about BvS, so I'm trying to make an point why some critics rate this movie so low.If you appreciate and understand comics, BvS being one of the better superhero movies out there is not a difficult judgment to make (Put Marvel in to the mix here as well). It has its faults,. Extremely solid start and differentiation of Superman and and Batman characters but then the last 60min or so in the film looses the traction - in a way a lot.However, back to critics... when you take a closer look at some of those critic reviews, sadly, lot of them rate this movie by analyzing elements that are not relevant to this gender. And that's my problem...It's as almost like someone who hates animated movies rating 'inside out' or 'toy story' low because the reason being the characters are not real. It is sad,... because you would expect these so call critics to have a broader perspective of the gender when reviewing these titles. So, I'd say, if you don't know the gender just leave it - review something you know and have a knowledge of. Ironically, most of these critics are also the ones who gets a free tickets to the premieres.BvS is not the perfect movie. I give it 7.5. But make your own judgment after watching the movie. There is plenty to enjoy. Don't make your judgement based upon a few critics who live in the land of Shakespeare - not that there is anything wrong at all with Shakespeare - but you know what I mean.",8,73,142,23 March 2016
