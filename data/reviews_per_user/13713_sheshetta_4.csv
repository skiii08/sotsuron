The New World," Get Lost There
","I love this dreamy, romanticized story of John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). It is amazing how they built the fort and Indian village by hand, in the manner in which they were originally built, just 10 miles away from the original location of Jamestown, in Virginia. If you like history and romance, you will probably dig it. If you fell asleep in school, you may find it boring. If you are interested in America's original inhabitants, you may find it intellectually stimulating. If you think Colin Farrell looks absolutely cool when he smiles shyly, instead of being the tough guy all of the time, you will enjoy watching him. If you enjoy the lyrical cinematography of Terrence Mallick, you will be all over it. That is what I think.Ta, Sheshetta",10,0,1,17 June 2006
Cloverfield," Don't Be Such a Sissy!
","People said the same thing about 'The Blair Witch Project'; that is, the hand held camera made them nauseated. Get over yourself. It is an effective film technique that is used to heighten the feeling of panic and escalate the manifestation of fear in the film. I liked 'Cloverfield'. I thought it was great fun. I thought the hand held camera was used to good advantage to help build the emotion and move the story along. It is appropriate to the characters running in the streets from a gigantic monster. It helps heighten our own fear and is appropriate to the situation. It certainly would not have been the same movie without it.",10,2,3,12 October 2008
The Happening," It's Blowing in the Wind
","I think this is M. Night Shyamalan's best movie since 'Signs'. Frankly, I don't understand all the controversy about 'what the problem is'. It is the planet, using the wind to manipulate the plants which are spreading toxins they have made to eradicate their worst enemy - humans. Humans have been systematically destroying the planet and the planet is fighting back. Why should the characters know all the answers? We expect our protagonists to be smooth and know everything and to save the day. Why do we not accept that the characters are flawed and human and do not know all the answers? The cinematography, the soundtrack, and the editing all help to escalate the sense of panic in the story, which is what makes a good story. Learn a little about screen writing before you criticize one of the best screenwriters of our time.",10,5,11,12 October 2008
The Wrestler," I don't really think this is a spoiler, but you decide
","I saw 'The Wrestler', last night, and it was compelling. From a screenwriter's point of view, I would have to call it an 'alternative screenplay'. It does not follow the traditional formula for a story arc. Many of the scenes do not build up to any tension; yet they are filled with subtext. I like the way the wrestlers are showed as buddies, before they going in the ring (note: the wrestlers shown as extras were all professional wrestlers). I think Mickey Rourke did an extraordinary performance because he was NOT playing himself, as so many people have stated that he was. He played a likable and sympathetic character, despite his faults. In reality, he is not likable, at all. That is what makes it a good acting job. The alternative part comes in when his character never goes through any change - regrets, yes, but he does not change. And, without spoiling anything, I must say I was moved to tears by the ending.",8,0,0,24 October 2009
