Walk the Line," Like a Phoenix, Joaquin rises from the ashes of previous films
","My first film experience with Mr. Phoenix was with gladiator. Wow, he did a great job of creating a character that I loved to hate. Then everything went down hill; his two M Nigh films did little to impress, he had a decent enough small role in 'Hotel Rwanda', but faith was lost again in Ladder 49 (yes I DID watch it, and yes it DOES suck).But Sweet redemption is now found for him. He can die happy knowing he played a role perfectly. I'm a light Cash fan-but I am quite familiar with his music and had a basic knowledge of his life from things that I had read. Phoenix manages to actually SOUND like the Man In Black-and since his voice was what made him unique-this is a big plus. Throw in an equally amazing performance by Reese and you have a solid movie. It may not cover any new grounds in film making, but what it does -it does well.",8,0,1,1 December 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Fantastical Delight!
","Well I have returned from a midnight showing and I think there is an actual contender to dethrone Mr Potter this weekend. It has been stated before that this is a family film because it appeals to all ages and I could not agree more. The movie has a certain charming magic that makes it more than bearable in the 'kiddy' parts and when the action occurs, it is very entertaining. I know there are a lot of comparisons to Lord of the Rings, well I won't bother. They are two separate movies and are good in their own rights (Well...ok...LOTR was vastly better). Stil the soundtrack was nice and beautiful, the acting-all around (from the witch, to the children, to Liam Neeson's voice as Aslan) although the best performance goes to the Wardrobe (haha-indeed!). It's a fun movie, perfect to watch anytime of year, but definitely should succeed during this Christmas season.",7,2,4,9 December 2005
Jarhead," Not what i expected-not a bad thing,
","OK, this has already been said, this isn't like a 'Thin Red Line' or 'Saving Private Ryan' (although they are both fine movies). The action here takes place in what isn't seen and in what isn't done. I did not feel that this was political movie in any way. I felt it was a story and a well told one at that. I'll continue the praise of the cinematography but I will also throw in that the soundtrack was pretty solid too. I liked it-and I judged it harshly. I was admittedly looking for some sneaky political message; however, all I found was good acting, a touching story (nothing wrong with a soldier crying), and well made film. Also as a final note, I enjoyed the voice-overs too, lol I am a sucker for well placed voice overs.",8,2,4,5 November 2005
Saw II," When in comparison with the original-BETTER
","I was a fan of Saw last year. Even though similar plot lines have developed before (the superior se7en comes to mind), Saw still felt original and twisted enough to maintain my interest and when combined with an awesome ending- I was won over. Now it is a year later and the story of the Jigsaw killer continues. This movie is not some lame sequel, yet a worthy follow-up of its predecessor. The acting was far better in this movie. The gore was amped up. And above all else, Saw II managed to maintain a feel of obscure discomfort and unease while watching. I had my doubts at first, but after seeing it , I am very glad this sequel was made. If the quality (by quality i mean -good disturbing psychological thriller material) of these films can remain, then I would gladly welcome more sequels in this series. PS-don't let anyone ruin the ending for you!",6,0,1,28 October 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The First Hp movie I've seen in theatres-wont be the last
","Well I have never considered myself a Harry Potter fan-at least not a 'real' one. Up until a year ago-i wouldve equated by knowledge of Rowling's world with that of a muggle's. But a few months ago I picked up 'Philopher's Stone' and read it. Then I read Chamber of Secrets. Eventually I went on to read all of the Harry Potter Books and have found (despite the fact they're clearly wrriten at an easily accessible reading level) they are quite enjoyable stories.Then I went on to watching the movies and although there are some differences i enjoyed them as well. This 4th installment is , in my humble opinion, the best Hp movie to date. The acting is better, the cinematography is darker, and i love Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemorte. They took a good action packed book and turned it into a good action packed movie. Also-I found quite a few parts of the movie to be pretty funny. I mean I never quite thought I would have found myself laughing at jokes in a Hp movie but there i was.The effects are top notch and Williams's score is as good as ever! Even if you are not an Hp fan-catch up on the storyline and check this movie out.",7,1,2,18 November 2005
Lord of War," Deeper than one may expect
","I saw LOW today with practically no expectations. I didn't expect to @see a high tension action flick. I didn't expect a sappy drama tale. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. This movie is far from the norm. It doesn't deal with international terror like some modern movies do; it tells the story of a man, his life, and his lie. Cage does a more than adaquette job of playing his character well. This is no normal anti-hero movie; this is tale about the soul. I liked it, I found it to be powerful, not a typical movie, but nonetheless one that many should see good movie see it, see it, I'm typing this to meet IMDb's requirements for a movie review",8,0,5,16 September 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Inspiring wonderful and Should be seen many times
","I love this movie for many reasons. The acting doesn't get any better. One gets easily pulled into the stories and characters with no hesitation. When a story can effortlessly make you care about the situations and troubles it presents, it deserves praise. This movie may not have a revolutionary plot, but it it still everything a good movie should be. One may think the ending is too 'touchy feely' but i think it adds to the overall appeal ,remember it's not called the 'Shawshank Damnation'. See it and enjoy and remember, it's OK to to cry over happy things too!Final Analysis: I will watch this movie many more times before I die",9,0,0,1 December 2005
Fantastic Four," Generic Superheroes Save the Wolrd Again!
","We've all been here before. Normal People become superheroes and have to have an also new threat evil threat. Now sometimes these stories can be saved by good acting and developing a tight story line (ie: Spiderman). However, FF4 is a lame story with lame dialogue (woman:your hot, human torch/johnny storm: thanks so are you). Now for the record I have nothing against the FF4-they can stop Dr. Doom any day of the week as far as I'm concerned and the action in this movie is actually not as bad as everything else. Here's a tip to directors of superhero movies: comic nerds like to see their heroes fight-not just sit around and do nothing for seventy minutes. This movie is bad at worst and generic at best. My advice-watch the ten-fifteen minute fight with Dr Doom, that'll be really all there is to enjoy-but hey what do i know; I only attend Comic Conventions, play Magic the Gathering and am a film major to boot.",5,0,1,1 December 2005
Sin City," Violence, Gore, and style
","Sin City is the type of movie that makes no apologies for its in-your-face-action and blunt crudeness at times. I personally loved movies like the Kill Bills, and it's apparent Tarentino had a say in this movie. I think that the acting was a tad shaky , but overall was spot-on for a movie based off a comic. Bottom line: see it in theatres, it's a beautiful movie and can be enjoyed by action and film-buff junkies alike.Personal Favorite Characters are: Elijah Woods, Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, and Josh Hartnet This movie has inspired me to check out the comics",8,2,5,2 April 2005
