Blade Runner 2049," Special effects
","I enjoyed it and the special effects were really good. Sadly, the ending left you scratching your head as what is to happen next.",8,0,4,7 January 2018
American Sniper," Amazing film
","I expected your usual 'War' movie, but this one blew me out of the water. The story line kept you into the movie waiting to see what was going to happen next. The mixed blend of what he had to offer for his country, his fellow soldiers along with his wife and children was extremely good. The movie offered love, romance, adventure and action all rolled into one. Upon leaving the theater, there was a man standing there saluting the screen with tears in his eyes. There was no doubt that he too has seen what our brave young soldiers have seen and have been through. Perhaps he was in Iraq and perhaps it brought back memories? As for me personally, I truly liked the movie and found it to be something that I will remember for a long while.",10,32,61,31 January 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," WOW!
","Went to see this movie because my daughter saw it twice and said that I would like it. So, to make her happy I went to see Bohemian Rhapsody and it was one of the best movies I have seen in years!!! The casting and acting was well done and the ending almost had me on my feet. Right after I saw it, I called my daughter and told she was indeed right, except I did not like it, I loved it..",10,6,9,19 November 2018
The Witch," Yawn
","The only thing scary about this film is that you have to pay to see it. I was truly disappointed and feel Walt Disney could have done a better job with it. The accents of the actors was very hard to understand at times and you had to really try to listen to what it was they were saying. The costumes and scenes were good as they did portray that era and what it would be like to be living in those conditions and times. The movie did try to be a scary thriller, as some critics stated it was supposed to be, but only with a couple of scenes (two or three). After a while the film got to the point of where it became boring as you waited and waited for something to scare you or make it worth while to see. Finally, the ending came and you sit there in disbelief thinking on the money and time you wasted.",1,11,27,20 February 2016
