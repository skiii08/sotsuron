Saturday Night Fever," This is the quintessential disco movie
","I first saw this movie at the drive-in as a kid. I remember being fairly amused seeing Vinnie Barbarino on the big screen for the first time. For what it's worth, this is the quintessential disco movie. The characters are believable, if not appealing. If you're a fan of the era, you'll love this film. If not, you can't help but be amused. Personally I fall somewhere closer to the latter. This isn't just a dance movie though, it deals with the characters and the other aspects of their life...questioning religious faith, unwanted pregnancy, relationships, friends, and family. For me, it's a quality period piece from the much maligned late 70s, set in Brooklyn. I have to admit I'm somewhat thankful that I was a little too young to really be involved in the disco era.*** (Out of 4)",7,0,1,18 October 2002
Catch Me If You Can," No matter who you find yourself rooting for, this is fun ride
","Fun. That's the best way to describe this story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), if that is his name. Steven Spielberg brings us a second good movie this year (Minority Report being the other). Based on a true story, this movie takes us on a non-stop journey of a teenage who is conning his way around the world posing as a pilot, doctor, and lawyer. This goes on for years, as he is able to stay just ahead of FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Christopher Walken also turns in a good performance as Frank Abagnale Sr. All of the supporting cast performed also performed well. No matter who you find yourself rooting for, this is fun ride.*** (Out of 4)",8,1,2,4 January 2003
The Ring," I got much amusement from the crowds responses
","If you want to see a scary movie, this is a good one. There are a fair amount of scenes to make you jump, but there's more than that. The storyline is decent and it's well filmed and acted. Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by it's PG-13 rating. It's not a gore-fest, but there are some unpleasant images that cross the screen. I'm pretty hardened after watching scary movies all my life, but I can still appreciate them. If you're going to see this movie, you should see it in a theater. I got much amusement from the crowds responses. There were three ladies in their 30s on my right, about half way through the movies I noticed they were curled up in their seats with their hands on their foreheads, covering their eyes anytime they thought something scary would happen. Then on my left there was a couple...they guy got a bit verbal at some of the last quarter of the movie. Not talking to his mate, but usually uttering one curse word at key moments. It all added to my enjoyment of the film. As a kicker, for those that have seen the movie, I got home and turned on my cell phone and the it immediately went off with a message. I laughed outloud. No worries, it was just my friend, Vince, inviting me to come over and watch the world series. I have not seen the original Japanese Ringu yet, but I am looking forward to seeing it as I've heard it's better and scarier! *** (Out of 4)",7,0,0,19 October 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A fun, emotional family movie
","Spielberg brought us a fun, emotional family movie about kids who find an alien that was accidently left behind. Though much of what happens is pretty unbelievable, for some reason it seems we are willing to accept it for the sake of the movie. There's a good 80s cast of kids and adults, including Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton (with his cool Space Invaders shirt), C. Thomas Howell, Dee Wallace, Peter Coyote...and a young Erika Eleniak, of Baywatch & Playboy fame, as the girl that Elliott kisses in the classroom. There is a good theme of acceptance. Unlike most other movies with aliens, everyone welcomes E.T., even the adults. I hadn't seen the movie in well over a decade, and I was pleasantly surprised that I still enjoyed it as much as I did back in the 80s. With it now being released on DVD, I'm glad it will bring E.T. to a whole new generation of kids*** (Out of 4)",8,0,1,8 November 2002
Bloody Sunday," A piece of history I wasn't previously aware of
","This movie tells the true story of 'Bloody Sunday'. On January 30, 1972, there was a civil rights March that took place in the Northern Ireland town of Derry. The protestors who were marching against internment were fired upon by English troops...27 were shot, killing 13 protestors. The protestors, led by Ivan Cooper, took great care to insure that it was a peaceful march. Yet, reminiscent of Kent State, the military was over zealous and fired on unarmed protestors. This film was shot with hand held cameras and had long takes, giving much the feel of a documentary...putting you right in the middle of the action. The majority of the film focused on the preparation of the March both by the protestors and the military, leading up to the big conflict at the end. Though I wouldn't call this a great film, I am really glad to have seen it since it is a piece of history I wasn't previously aware of. Although being very familiar with the civil rights movement in the United States, the story seemed very familiar to me.",7,3,9,4 May 2003
Spider-Man 2," A solid sequel ...
","A solid sequel to my favorite superhero movie. While I have been unimpressed with most of the recent superhero movies (The Punisher, Hulk), the Spider-Man movies have continued to remain a step or two ahead of the pack. While not staying 100% true to the original comics, they don't stray too far. The production is top-notch and give us a visual treat with out going too far beyond believability. Despite some initial reservations, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have proved to be quality choices for the roles of Spider-Man and Mary Jane. Along with a solid supporting cast and good direction by Sam Raimi, the Spider-Man movie franchise has set the bar for superhero movies in the 2000s. I'm looking forward to the next installment. Unfortunately Spider-Man 3 isn't coming until 2007. Meanwhile, I remain hopeful for other quality additions to the genre.*** (out of 4)",8,1,2,31 December 2004
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," A fairly typical romantic comedy
","A fairly typical romantic comedy. Not really anything new, but there rarely is in the genre. The premise is pretty unbelievable, but Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey are pleasant to watch and were a believable couple to be. I enjoyed several scenes in the movie, especially the 'Bullshit' card game with his family. No real surprises.** (out of 4)",5,1,2,9 February 2003
X-Men," This is a good movie that tells us the origin of several members of the X-Men
","Before the blockbuster release of Spider-Man in 2002, the Marvel classic comic, X-Men, came to the big screen. This is a good movie that tells us the origin of several members of the X-Men. It deals with the fact that these mutants are outcast from society and considered dangerous, second class citizens by the majority of the non-mutant society. While really they are just people trying to cope with their differences and trying to make it in an unaccepting world. Throw in a couple of bad guys and it makes for some good action. Not only do the X-Men have to fight society, but fellow mutants that have chosen the use their powers against society. I only have a minimal knowledge of the X-Men comics, but from what I can tell their transition to the big screen is pretty successful. The actors all play their roles well and the story is interesting enough to hold your interest between the special effects and action scenes. *** (Out of 4)",8,0,0,3 May 2003
We Were Soldiers," I would call this movie anti-war, but pro-soldier
","This is an excellent, realistic depiction of the first major U.S. battle in Vietnam. Though it's more than that. This movie had two big things that I hadn't seen in a movie in about the Vietnam war before. First was the deep loyalty of the American soldiers for each other, and secondly, what the wives of these soldiers went through back home. These are both things common in WWII movies, but this is the first time I've really seen it in a Vietnam war movie. During this battle, it also was sure to show the Vietnam point of view as well. It showed how the battle played out like a chess game, colonels on both sides predicted each others moves. Mel Gibson's portrayal of Lt Colonel Hal Moore and Sam Elliot as Sergeant Major Plumley were both excellent. I think this was probably Greg Kinnear's finest performance ever as Major Crandall, the lead helicopter pilot. Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore back home was very touching. And all of the supporting cast really turned in great performances, making for a very realistic movie. The battle scenes were incredible, but gut-wrenching to watch. I would call this movie anti-war, but pro-soldier.***1/2 (Out of 4)",9,1,2,29 September 2002

The Passion of Joan of Arc," I am very impressed with the excellence of this 75 year old film
","I am very impressed with the excellence of this 75 year old film. It is very well directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and extremely well acted. Maria Falconetti, as Joan of Arc, was superb. This was a silent movie, but her expressions and haunting eyes speak volumes as she reacts to her inquisition. This film has holds up and is extremely powerful telling the story of the trial of Joan of Arc. This film was thought lost as the original prints were burned in a fire. Fortunately for us, a great copy was found in a mental hospital in Norway in 1981. It was restored in 1985 and looks incredible for such an old movie. In 1988, Richard Einhorn, saw this movie and fell in love with this movie. He composed an excellent musical score, Voices of Light. He wrote it as a stand alone piece, but luckily we have the option of having it play along while watching the DVD. It perfectly accentuates the movie and makes it an even more powerful experience.***1/2 (Out of 4)",9,2,5,4 January 2003
The Italian Job," The best way to describe this movie is 'fun'
","The best way to describe this movie is 'fun'. It's a quality heist flick with a very nice cast...and the mini coopers! You might say there's nothing really new here, but it's all done well. I've easily seen a dozen heist movies in the past few years, but this one is one of the best of the bunch. All of the actors played their characters well and really brought them to life with their little quirks. And the stunt work was phenomenal. From the minis to the boat chase in the canals of Venice, it was all very believable with the actors doing most of their own stunt work. This movie is a remake and I've been a little down on the large quantity of remakes in recent years. But the term remake is pretty loose here. The only real similarities are that it's a heist film that uses mini coopers for the getaway cars. The story is very different. With all due respect to the 1969 original, which I also enjoyed, this movie stands on it's own.*** (Out of 4)",8,1,2,4 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Lord of the Rings series is definitely set to be the epic of the early 2000s
","The Lord of the Rings series is definitely set to be the epic of the early 2000s. This first movie has definitely revitalized the fantasy-adventure genre. I enjoyed it in the theater, but having not read the books I think I was more focused on learning the stories and characters. But on a second, more relaxed, viewing I was able to enjoy the movie even more. The story lines are interesting, the characters enjoyable and realistic, the scenery is exquisite. The special F/X and sets are fantastic, seamlessly blending characters of different proportions. The only slight negative, is that by nature, it leaves you hanging at the end. Since the rest of the series is being brought to us so quickly, I suppose that's okay. I sure am looking forward to the next installment to see the adventures continue. I guess that's one advantage of not reading the books, the movies will be that much more of a surprise.***1/2 (Out of 4)",8,0,0,20 November 2002
Heartbreak Ridge," Eastwood's ability to play a good tough guy makes this film
","Clint Eastwood plays the combat-hardened Gunnery Sgt., Tom Highway, who has a hard time staying out of trouble when he's not fighting a war. He's put in charge of a group of undisciplined recon marines and his personal objective is to whip them into shape at any cost. Though this isn't one of the best military movies ever made, Eastwood's ability to play a good tough guy makes this film. There are a few things that keep it from being a great film. Some of the supporting cast aren't top caliber and come across a little hard to take seriously. And probably the one thing that bothers me the most is Eastwood's repeatedly verbally reminding us that a marine is supposed to 'Adapt, Improvise, Overcome'. He must have uttered those words a half dozen times throughout the movie. I think more than twice is overkill and the constant reminder made it a little less meaningful. He does have some good lines and plays the part well. Though cliche, I enjoyed his I-Don't-Give-A-Rat's-Ass-About-The-Rules attitude when dealing with his inexperienced superiors. He was going to do what he thought best. I don't think that's how it really works in the marines and I doubt he could actually get away with as much as he did in the real military, but it makes for good entertainment. *** (out of 4)",7,0,1,13 October 2002
Spider-Man," Spider-Man has set the bar high for the future of superhero movies
","I had heard talk of a Spider-Man movie for well over a decade with different directors and actors rumored to be involved. Then it became official and it was announced that Sam Raimi would be the director, Tobey Maguire would be Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst would be Mary Jane, and Willem Dafoe would be the Green Goblin. I have to admit I was a little worried. Would they pull it off...a movie worthy of one of my favorite superheros. What they did was simply make the best superhero movie to date. I was afraid the special effects would be cheesy, but they were highly believable and fun to watch. I was concerned that the actors wouldn't be up to their roles, but they all turned in great performances. I was worried that they wouldn't stay true to the story and though they did take some liberties, they never strayed too far. I went in with high hopes and what I got was a very enjoyable film. Good for both kids and adults. Spider-Man has set the bar high for the future of superhero movies. I hope we continue to get some high quality movies with the upcoming releases of Daredevil & The Hulk in 2003. I have a lot of the same concerns, but hopefully they'll come through like Spider-Man did.Rank: #2 in 2002 ***1/2 (out of 4)",9,0,0,11 November 2002
Spirited Away," Pleasing visual qualities and it's interesting characters
","The things I enjoyed most about this Japanese animated feature are it's pleasing visual qualities and it's interesting characters. I've heard it compared to Alice in Wonderland which I can definitely see, but I was also reminded of The Neverending Story as I watched it...maybe because of the dragon/boy character Haku. Regardless of what you might compare it to, it's a tale of a young girl who is thrust into an alternate world full of strange, but interesting characters. If it has a flaw, I felt it ran a bit long at over 2 hours...though I admit I was a bit tired while watching it. It's quirky characters and stunning animation are pleasing to watch, but it didn't quite live up to the hype I had heard about the movie prior to watching it. One other note, I've read others say it's good for the entire family, I think really young kids might not appreciate it that much.

Grave of the Fireflies," This is the most touching animated feature I've ever seen
","This is the most touching animated feature I've ever seen. I truly cared about the characters and was saddened at the tragic events they had to deal with. A young teen boy and his four year old sister are orphaned while their father is in the Japanese navy and their mother is killed in a fire bombing. Though there are a few small bits of humor as a way for them to cope with their situation, I caution you not to think this is a typical Japanese Anime story. It's as gut-wrenching as any live-action war movie and shows the attacks on Japan in a way I've never seen depicted before, from the personal point of view of two children. If you can take it, I think it's an excellent film that tells an important story.",9,2,3,24 November 2002
8 Mile," A good modern story reminiscent of the old school days
","Let me start by saying, I had little knowledge about Eminem before going to see this movie. I am a fan of rap music up until the early 90s, but haven't been too interested in anything that I've heard recently. I can't name you an Eminem song and the few minutes of his music that I'd heard before this movie definitely weren't my style. When I saw a preview for this movie, it looked like it might be mildly interesting, but definitely wasn't on my must see list by any means. Yesterday I read my good friend Vince's review of the movie at Qwipster's Movie Reviews and decided to go see it. It was a good modern story reminiscent of the old school days where rappers would 'battle' each other with freestyle raps. I love the scene where B. Rabbit dogs the guy in the lunch line who is making fun of other people. Back in the day, these battles were common. Rappers Kool Moe Dee and L.L. Cool J had an ongoing feud and each would come out with songs dissing (before dissing was a word) each other. But more commonly, it was just a way to trash your enemies in the street in a non-violent manner or a little good-natured ribbing among your friends. The overall story was a semi-autobiographical tale of a young man struggling against the odds to make it big. Not knowing Eminem's story, I can't say how close this movie is to his life, but it's a pretty good story. Though fairly typical and predictable, it's well acted especially by Eminem and Kim Basinger. I think it's safe to say that I won't become a big fan of Eminem's music, but he was good in this movie.

From Dusk Till Dawn," A fun movie from Robert Rodriguez
","A fun movie from Robert Rodriguez and a great cast of George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino (who wrote the story), Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Selma Hayek, and Cheech Marin (who played three roles). This is a rather violent, action movie that could have easily been a turn off, but Robert Rodriguez took Quentin's story and they made an entertaining movie. Quentin's characters always seem to have so much life to them and I think that's what makes the movie better. It could have easily just been a cheesy, totally unbelievable action/horror piece. Not that we're going to walk away thinking what happened could really happen, but as I was watching the movie I wasn't considering the plausibility and was just enjoying the ride. Nice little bits of comedy thrown in which I think made it that much easier to take the violent parts. I loved the neon sigh outside of the 'Titty Twister'.*** (Out of 4)",7,1,2,29 September 2002
Black Hawk Down," My best friend was a Black Hawk Mechanic in Somalia
","One evening I first saw the preview for this movie and it gave me chills. I knew they had written a book about this incident, but didn't realize they were making it into a movie. My best friend in school joined the Army shortly after high school and became a helicopter mechanic. An admirable occupation for sure, but we sure worried about him when he spent the Gulf War in Saudi Arabia/Kuwait/Iraq. And shortly after hearing about trouble in Somalia, he was on his way over there. I admit that before this movie, I didn't know that much about this incident. I had heard about the book, but didn't really know the details. Shortly after seeing the preview for the movie, I emailed Charlie to find out more. Yes, he was a Black Hawk Mechanic in Somalia, but he had come home shortly before this event took place. However, he did know many of the people who were involved in it. He told me about what he went through personally waiting for the outcome and how hard it was for him. His story really brought it home for me and personalized this movie like no other war movie. It was more real when seeing the soldiers injured and killed. I just watched this movie for the second time and the effect wasn't lessened. I found myself getting chills like never before when watching a war movie. The movie itself is excellently and realistically filmed. It definitely puts you in the middle of the battle. The most frustrating thing for me was watching the poor command decisions being made by guys in charge that lead to this incident being worse than it had to be. Keeping the chopper circling over head, when those on board wanted so much to get in there and help the trapped soldiers. I know the chain of command is important in the military, but sometimes I think it's important to trust the soldiers who are there in the battle. I have always had a great respect for soldiers who are willing to put their life on the line for the sake of the country, but am often frustrated by the leaders that put them in such awful situations in the first place. It's a great story of comraderie between the soldiers. The scenes where the soldiers make it back to base, but go back out again are very touching. It is so hard for me to fully comprehend having one's life depend on the randomness of where a bullet happens to fly in battle. I'm pretty sure I could handle myself as good as the next guy, but I don't ever want to be in that situation. Because if it's not you, then it's probably your buddy next to you. I definitely sleep better at night knowing Charlie has retired from the military and is now launching rockets for Boeing. I respect his service that he put in for our country, but am happy to know that I'm not going to get a phone call that he's off to some God awful part of the globe. Though, unfortunately we are currently shipping soldiers back to the gulf...my friend's husband just left on the U.S.S. Nimitz for an undetermined amount of time. Everyone say their prayers.***1/2 (Out of 4)",8,0,0,8 February 2003

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A fun fantasy story that's good for the whole family
","The Harry Potter story is brought from the books to the big screen. Never having read the books, I have to rely on anecdotal evidence that the movie stayed pretty true to the stories. I first saw the movie with my family, who've all read the books. But my youngest sister, Kelly, is the biggest fan. After the movie she was telling me all the things that were different or left out. I jokingly asked her, 'So, you didn't like the movie?'...to which she replied that it was her favorite movie of all-time. That alone, tells me that the movie succeeded. I enjoyed the movie myself and think it's a fun fantasy story that's good for the whole family. The director, Chris Columbus, did a nice job and the actors, especially the kids, were great. Harry Potter is a feast for the eyes and obviously a lot of thought went into the detail. It's heartwarming for me to see this kind of movie made...Something healthy that kids of all ages can be excited about. As a side note, I am especially happy with the books being so popular. It seems like I hardly talk to a kid who hasn't read the books. That says a lot.

Vanilla Sky," One in a long line of unnecessary hollywood remakes of good foreign films
","This one in a long line of unnecessary hollywood remakes of good foreign films in the last few years...Insomnia, The Ring, The Vanishing to name a few others. The trend disturbs me a little. I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with remaking movies and there have been some great films that are loose remakes of other films, like A Fistful of Dollars and Scarface. But to me it seems unnecessary to take an already good film and do an almost exact remake of it. For me, the worst one of all time was Gus Van Sant's near exact remake of the masterpiece, Pscyho. I don't see the point, if you're just trying to copy it. I guess the point is to make money, but I'd expect a little more from established movie makers. It's obvious that the director, Cameron Crowe, has originality. He wrote, directed, and even composed original music for his last film, Almost Famous, which happens to be my favorite movie of 2000. Maybe he used up too much on that film, which was semi-autobiographical and needed an easier fix this go round...I'm really not sure. Vanilla Sky itself wasn't awful, but I find it significantly lacking on all levels in comparison to Abre Los Ojos. Vanilla Sky lacks the heart and subtleness of the original. There are a couple things I'd like to mention, but I think it gives too much away. Another downfall is that it's glammed up with big, known faces...Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell, Cameron Diaz. Even Spielberg pops in for a cameo. However, I did find it interesting to see Penélope Cruz play Sofia in both movies, but like everything good thing in Vanilla Sky, it was just ripped off from the original. I think when these lesser known foreign gems are found, they should be brought to the U.S. and given the bigger released they deserve and not just copied. Or at least if you remake a film, do something different with it and not just try and remake the same darn movie. Okay, that's my rant. ** (Out of 4)",6,0,0,20 November 2002
Identity," It borrows from some excellent sources...
","A decent psychological thriller, but it falls a little short of being really good. It borrows from some excellent sources with some bits of Hitchcock, Agatha Christie, and The Twilight Zone. Unfortunately it's got a bit of slasher film which is what keeps me from recommending it higher. If you can handle some genuinely grotesque scenes and jump cuts galore, the rest of the movie is definitely worth checking out. For that reason, I won't say too much more about it to avoid spoiling any parts of the movie. It's well acted, well directed, and a good story. I think having seen so many of these kind of movies, some of it was slightly predictable...but there are plenty of surprises for everyone.**1/2 (Out of 4)",7,1,2,3 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," Picks up right where X-Men left off
","X2 is a good sequel that picks up right where X-Men left off. All of the same characters (and actors) return, along with a few new mutants. Since the first movie focused on introducing the X-Men to us, this movie was able to concentrate on the story a little more. Not only is society up in arms, thanks to the government's negative spinning on the situation, but we didn't really think that the plastic jail would hold Magneto for long did we?! So the X-Men once again find themselves battling on two fronts. If you're a fan of superhero movies, you'll probably be pleased with how the series is progressing on the big screen. *** (Out of 4)",7,0,0,3 May 2003
Gangs of New York," Daniel Day-Lewis carries the movie
","Martin Scorsese brings us this excellent period piece set in the tumultuous mid-1800s in New York's Five Points. It takes place during the real events leading up to the 1863 draft riots. I admit I don't know how historically accurate it is, but it gives the appearance of being authentic. I had been anxiously awaiting this film, but had some slight reservations regarding the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. I like them, but weren't sure if they'd be right for these roles. Both did admiral jobs. Leo surprised me a bit with how well he came across and Cameron definitely did her best though occasionally seemed slightly unbelievable for the time. The success of this movie was the casting of Daniel Day-Lewis as William 'The Butcher' Cutting in his first role in several years. He carried this movie with his excellent and believable portrayal of this bad man. The movie runs a bit long, but to it's credit, it does cover a lot of ground.
