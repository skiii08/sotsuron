Requiem for a Dream," Don't do drugs. No, really.
","Requiem for a Dream is a staggeringly bleak look into the lives of four interconnected drug addicts living in Brooklyn. The story follows an older Jewish woman, Sara, her son Harry, his friend Tyrone and Harry's girlfriend Marion as they lose their sanity, dignity, bodies and eventually their futures to cocaine, diet pills, and heroin. The plot has been summarized enough here, but suffice it to say that it's one of the grimmest, heaviest films I've seen  and I've seen a fair amount. Requiem plays as an agonizing train wreck that ends without any hope whatsoever for our main characters. This film is full of moments where I wanted to grab the characters and force them to stop their self-destructive behavior. It really is gut-wrenching and is very tough to watch  viewer take caution.Now that I think about it, Requiem reminds me of the more recent Passion of the Christ. Both are very well shot, edited and produced, but are tough to call entertaining and certainly not the kind of movies you'd pop in on a rainy day. While Requiem for a Dream is very much an anti-drug film, the message I got out of the film is: Your actions have consequences. As I watched the heartbreaking scene near the end, where Sara's two elderly friends sit on a bench outside the hospital and sob after visiting her, I couldn't help but wonder if Aronofsky had people in his own life who were destroyed by drug addiction.So while I hesitantly recommend Requiem for a Dream, it's not the kind of film I'd care to own, and is certainly not for children or the squeamish. Powerful, brutal, and nightmarish, this film will have you questioning if you drink too much coffee. You may think I'm kidding, but I'm not.",7,3,5,3 September 2006
Crash," Not horrible, but quite shallow.
","Caught this movie the other night, as I was curious to see what Hollywood deems 'Best Picture' material these days.Crash is an uneven film. It was mildly engaging, well shot and had an enjoyable musical score. The constant cutting between various characters in dramatic situations kept the film moving along at a brisk pace, and the acting was above average. However, the message Crash tries to convey seems to amount to:1. The City of LA is filled with racists. 2. Racism is bad. 3. Are you sure you're not racist? Even a little bit?The dialog was borderline absurd; there was virtually no one in the film who was able to interact with another person without the topic of race immediately entering the situation. In the Crash universe, a typical elevator conversation would play out thusly:A professionally dressed white man and a black youth with baggy jeans and bling enter an elevator.Racist white man: 'Hello young black man. I notice you are black. Would you happen to be carrying a handgun?'Thuggish-looking black man: 'Mr. White man, I am offended! Just because I dress like the gangsters you see on MTV does not qualify me as a gang-banger! You're just perpetuating a damaging stereotype about young black men in America today! You should be ashamed of yourself. But to answer your question, yeah, I'm packing.'The women in the film are shrill, demanding and hysterical, the men are degraded, bitter and fit their stereotypes a far too well. Oh, and everyone is racist.I just can't see this as being Best Picture material, but then again, neither could I with 'Chicago'. I suppose in today's culture, any film that broaches the subject of racism, however ham-fistedly, must be considered edgy and bold.I didn't rate Crash a total disaster, but if I wanted an enlightening look on race in America today, I'd watch Chappelle's Show. So should you.",5,6,12,3 April 2006
Psycho," High suspense!
","I am 23 years old and have just gotten around to watching 'Pyscho' for the first time tonight. Gave me the chills. Very few movies are able to do that, so this is high praise indeed. All the praise you've heard about this film is true. The acting (especially by Perkins) is excellent, the score unsettling, and the cinematography brilliant.The story begins with two lovers in Phoenix sharing a quick romp during Marion's (played by Janet Leigh) lunch break. She returns to her job and is given $40,000 to deposit at the bank. She takes the money and returns to her home, then decides to flee Phoenix and run away with her boyfriend. She drives most of the night, and, tired, pulls in to the Bates motel for the night....Suffice it to say, what follows is one of the best murder-thrillers I've had the pleasure to watch. Everything about this movie is handled well, and Perkins knocks it out of the park playing the friendly, stuttering, and finally chilling Norman Bates. I can only imagine how shocking this movie was when it was released in 1960 -- many of these themes had yet to be explored in cinema, and if the infamous bathroom scene is still a bit unsettling to modern viewers, it must have been truly terrifying at the time.This film is Hitchcock at his finest. Pure suspense.",9,1,2,5 April 2006
