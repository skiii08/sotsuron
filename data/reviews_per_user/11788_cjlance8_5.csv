Casablanca," Casablanca
","Casablanca starring Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart, and Paul Henried was an all-around great movie. This is a romantic film where Ilsa was falling for Rick and Victor. Rick was Rick and Ilsa had the stronger relationship. Victor and Ilsa seemed to have a plain relationship. In the end, Rick forces the captain to allow Victor and Ilsa to go to America while he stays behind. This shows how much he loves Ilsa because he wants the best for her even though it meant her going with Victor. A scene that was good in the movie was the national anthems being played in the caf√©. The German's started singing their national anthem. Then Rick cued everyone else to do the French national anthem. This is a key scene because it shows the people actually standing up against the Germans and their invasions. The relationship with Rick and the Captain was also good too. Most viewers at the end would actually think that Rick turned on him but he didn't. He used the captain to help Victor and Ilsa to get away and then the captain stood up for Rick when the Germans came to try and stop them. It shows how strong their relationship was.",10,1,3,8 March 2015
Annie Hall," Annie Hall summary
","Annie Hall directed by Woody Allen wasn't really an interesting movie to me. It was a very funny and very creative movie though. There was comedy throughout the whole movie that was really funny. He has a lot of dry humor that will make everyone laugh. He was very creative throughout the movie using many different techniques. In the beginning, he starts with him in front of the camera telling jokes to the audience. He talks about his life and all of it has nothing to do with the movie. Also in the beginning, he is in the classroom and he kisses the girl. His younger self goes up to the room while his older self sits in the desk and tries to defend him self. It was brilliant. At some points, he would stop the film and talk to the audience about what is happening. He also uses subtitles when he is talking to Annie on the balcony. She starts it off by being funny with him being Jewish. They are both talking to each other with subtitles underneath with words that they really wanted to say. It was brilliant and funny at the same time.",10,0,0,5 May 2015
The Graduate," The Graduate Review
","The Graduate directed by Mike Nichols was a phenomenal movie. I finally have watched the movie to the catchy song, here's to you, Mrs. Robinson by Simon and Garfunkel. I never knew this song was from this and for this movie. All in all though, I loved this movie from start to finish. It was a perfect plot and Ben was your typical kid who doesn't know what to do after college. The whole scenario with having an affair with someone's wife, then falling in love with their daughter was brilliant. The quality of the movie was great and the color looked really good. The best scene to me was at the end of the movie. I loved it when he was standing at the top of the church banging on the glass door. He didn't have a care in the world and he was going for what he really wanted. It was really cool. But after that, when their on the bus driving away was the best. They got on the bus and they went to sit and the back and seemed very happy. When the bus drove away, the look they both gave each other was perfect. They both looked like they knew they messed up with what they had just done and that they couldn't take it back. The bus was already leaving symbolizing that there was no turning back.",10,0,0,27 April 2015
Singin' in the Rain," review
","Singing in the Rain by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly is the best musical movie I've ever seen. I am really not a big fan of musicals and going into this one, I wasn't too excited. After the movie though I changed my view on it. It was fantastic throughout and it was finally good to see a movie in color. All the songs in the movie were good and I didn't know some of the songs were from this movie. 'Good Morning' is a song we hear a lot these days and I had no idea that this where it came from. It was also a good feeling at the end of the movie to see Lena be embarrassed by everyone at the show. She had the snobby attitude and I just didn't like her at all. Her scratchy high pitch voice fit perfectly with her because it was annoying just like she was as a person. Her voice was awful and they did a good job of making the audience really hate her and favor Kathy.",10,0,1,7 April 2015
Psycho," Psycho Review
",Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing thriller movie. Hitchcock kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. This movie is flawless and the cinematography is perfect. Using the shadows and covering up the killer in the shower scene was perfect. It couldn't get any better. The shower scene is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in any movie. The camera zooms in as she showering to the shadowy figure in the background. Then he opens the curtain and the score music comes on which was perfect and fit so well. While he is stabbing her his whole figure is still hidden and you can't see his face. Then he leaves the bathroom as she's dying and the camera is just focused on her hand as she is slowly dying. It was perfect and just gave me that weird feeling. I loved it. That scene describes a horror movie perfectly. The acting job too during that scene was great. She made it look so realistic and it was spectacular.,10,1,2,12 May 2015
