The King's Speech," Bye Bye Bertie...hello George VI
","It's a buddy movie. Don't expect Butch and Sundance but it works. Award worthy performances by Firth and Rush.There are flaws. It's a tad too long with some mid script drag. The director fails to open it up and it seems like a play. A couple of outdoor walk and talks aren't enough. The cartoon Churchill character was a distraction, as was the music score, that at times, was noticeable for the wrong reason.It's an interesting time in history. The lead characters are immediately likable. The movie is worthy of the praise it will receive. It's a hear it, rather then see it experience.",8,5,14,5 December 2010
Moneyball," There's no clock in baseball
","Biographies are a tough sell. Sports movies are a tough sell. Baseball is a slow game. Enter Aaron Sorkin. This guy could write paint drying exciting.Brad Pitt as Billy Beane carries the movie on his shoulders. Jonah Hall looks and acts his part. Philip Seymour Hoffman's name is longer then his part, and Robin Wright looks good but don't blink or you'll miss her.Like a baseball game, the movie is a tad too long and on the slow side. Be patient it's worth it. The movie has heart and a money isn't always the answer message.It's a feel good true story. This movie will make many ten best lists and will contend at award season. See it.",Null,0,1,28 September 2011
The Avengers," Don't let the portal hit you on the way out.
","It's big, loud and delivers just what you expect from a summer blockbuster. A fun cast drops jokes like it is open mike night at the comedy club.The action gets redundant and the movie is a tad long. If you are looking for a relaxing time at the movies this isn't it. It is an assault on the senses. The 3D that was an add-on didn't seem worth the up-charge.The after credits scene is good for a laugh but not worth sitting through the credits to get there.It seemed like Ironman was the only character with any sort of a life. It was nice to see a few moments of Pepper Potts always barefoot as not to be too tall for Tony Stark.Great start for summer box office. Everyone will see this movie once. There is no need to see it twice.",7,0,5,13 May 2012
Black Swan," For the birds
",Natalie Portman battles herself as good and evil? She's a struggling chorus girl ballerina with the 'I gave it all up for you' mother. When she is given the lead in Swan Lake the feathers fly.It is not a good ballet movie. It's a weak horror movie. It's a tame Lesbian sex movie. It is funny for the wrong reasons. There's this business with her back that turns out Portman has a similar problem that Jeff Goldblum had in the fly.Thinly written cartoon characters inhabit this world that may be all in her mind. There is no one to care about.Enough with the vomit scenes.Go to any ballet and avoid this really bad time at the movies.,1,31,73,30 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates 1-4-3-2
","1432 rates the Pirate movies from best to worst. Johnny Depp is back at it again. He is so comfortable in the role he could play it in his sleep. At times it appears he is sleepwalking through the rolePenelope Cruz is fun to watch as his, it's about time, love interest. Except for the mermaids, it is a straight forward pirate adventure as distinguished from the Zombie, monster laden things that made up much of Pirates 2.Unless you are a die-hard Pirates fan you can save the IMAX 3D up charge. Many of the scenes are night scenes that come off dark. Most of the 3D effects are swords coming at you. The movie is a tad too long. Perhaps too much time was devoted to religion. The after credits scene is not worth the wait if you're in need of a restroom.Pirates IV meets the requirements of a summer blockbuster. It is brash, loud and a lot of fun. You know what to expect and it delivers.",7,2,4,23 May 2011
Men in Black 3," Black suits show some old wrinkles.
","Josh Brolin is great. The rest of the movie not so much. Things are moving along fine until J and K go for some pie. There's the 'this coffee tastes like dirt' joke and things grind to a halt.Griffin comes in with a pace and style that makes watching paint dry seem exciting. Boris the Animal is not much of a villain, basically something out of a bad biker movie. When you consider they had unlimited universes of reptiles and bugs, and who knows what, to choose from seems like there were better options.It's not an awful movie but they had the talent and budget to do much better. It's OK at an early bird price, but there is little reason to pay a 3D up-charge.",6,4,9,26 May 2012
The Monuments Men," Clooney phones it in.
","Here's a big cast on a big stage directed down enough to make it less then the sum of its parts. Perhaps Clooney tried to do too much as producer, writer, director and main star. What should be an action movie in the style of 'The Dirty Dozen' is reduced to a stop, go and sputter with a number of 'let's talk about it' scenes.The question posed is art worth a life is dwarfed by magnitude of issues associated with World War II. Particularly troublesome was the ridiculous method of dealing with the holocaust reducing it to the Clooney character being able to get his bagel and coffee. George just jump across the table and break his other arm.There is a good score and some good flag waving. The movie is very watchable but thinking back it should have been much better.",6,1,3,11 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Show me the Captain
","Based on a true story and if you've seen the trailers you know what is going to happen. Give credit to the writer, director, and cast for making an outstanding movie even if you know the ending before it starts.The performances are award worthy as are the technical aspects of the movie. Perhaps it is too long and starts a bit to early with the Catherine Keener scenes.The tension and suspense is maintained and you even feel for the pirates who are stuck in the situation that cannot end well.This is one of the best movies of the year. See it.",8,0,2,23 October 2013
Sucker Punch," Pass the punch Â…sucker
","Walk into the theater run out. Not that it is unpleasant from beginning to end, just at the beginning and end.So let's see we have hot girls in sexy outfits killing World War I zombie Germans, slaying dragons, disarming bombs, so what can be bad? Everything else.The fun action stuff is in her mind? How many of these adventures is enough to distract while the girls go on the treasure hunt for the five items needed to escape? Be glad they didn't need ten, too bad they didn't need three.Zack Snyder gives his signature video game look to this effort, but ultimately it's a unsatisfying movie experience.",3,7,17,29 March 2011
War Dogs," Flawed but watchable.
","Jonah Hill has put the weight back on. If you are board, start counting the 'F' bombs, it could be a record number. The movie starts with a flash back and it is so long in returning to that scene you almost forgot you were watching a story in flashback. There are anti- Semitic overtones that are not subtle.Forget the flaws and enjoy a well told story that takes you to interesting places. There is comedy, action, and some serious issues. The performances are serviceable but nobody works too hard. It was interesting to learn that one of the individuals that the story is based on does the folk singing in the home scene. The movie plays well on the big screen and comedy works best in a shared audience experience.",6,1,2,24 August 2016
Source Code," Code rhymes with explode
","Only eight minutes to write this review. If I'm making any progress I'll get another eight minutes. Why eight not seven or nine, they'll tell you why with a straight face. They'll explain the 'Source Code' as they know it. Everything is delivered as the gospel in this writer created science fiction world.The characters are likable. Turns out Jake is half the man he use to be in this who's doing it action thriller. It's a serious 'Groundhog Day' mostly on a train. The 'do-overs' are changed enough to keep it interesting.Will Jake find the bomb, the bomber, and save the world. Last time I looked Chicago was still there. As hard as it is to imagine there's even a Hollywood ending.",7,0,3,1 April 2011
Skyfall," 50 years of practice
","Enough to recommend but after fifty years it could have been better. Great opening sequence but how did Bond survive? Don't ask? What made the best Bond movies great were interesting antagonists. Here we get a blonde Javier Bardem complete with gay overtones. His performance and look was often distracting.Plenty of action, lots of shooting and explosions. Bond runs a lot, through streets, over the ice, through the office. Run James run. It has the locations, the music, and a few bond girls to keep your attention.In addition to the action there are some poignant moments and some back story that was never included in other Bond films. Even the title is new information.Deliveries what you expect from a Bond film including the welcome assurance that James Bond will return to the big screen in the near future.It's a tad long but it's the best of the Daniel Craig efforts.",8,1,11,8 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Seems like Iron Man 4 or 5 by now
","Robert Downey Jr. has played the role of Tony Stark so many times he is Iron Man. Here he is again, this time after the villain called the Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley. Gwyneth Paltrow gets a bit more to do but still gets to stand around and look good.The movie seems a tad long and maybe too many things blow up. Seems like nearly everything and everyone blows up.When you go to an Iron Man movie you should know what to expect. This one delivers. Remember you are going to a comic book movie that is best enjoyed when you forget logic, plot and just go with the action and the humor.it's a great way to start off the summer movie season.",7,1,2,10 May 2013
Gravity," Tears in space
","Sandra Bullock had trouble driving a bus, now nearly age fifty she drives space crafts. If one big star among the stars isn't enough, add George Clooney and his great voice.The movie is an edge of your seat feast for the eyes. The visual effects are outstanding. Bullock gives an award worthy performance. In a time when so many movies are dialogue driven here is a tight ninety minutes with few people and very little dialogue.The movie works as you can't wait to get outside and take a breath. This one should be seen on a big screen. Tears floating weightless look great in 3D.",7,2,5,4 October 2013
Wind River," Takes the murder mystery to a new venue.
",An FBI agent teams with a tracker to solve a murder on an Indian reservation. The locations and the snow are what lifts this above the usual entries in the solve a murder genre. The snow is so cold you feel it.The performances are good with the exception of one of the Olsen twins who was unconvincing as an FBI agent. There is a level of violence that may not have been necessary. The shootout reduces the cast to a manageable number.The movie is in limited release but it's sticking in theaters. It looks good on the big screen and worth the price to see it in a theater.,8,0,4,5 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Methadone for Star War Junkies
","If your are Star War fan it rates higher. If you are not concerned with great CGI and battles on land, air, and space you may get tired of the redundant over long fight scenes.Like with most Star War movies, the robots are as interesting as the people. There is a brief glimpse of the familiar robots and some knew wise cracking metal creations.Everything is just not quite satisfying. The new lead characters don't break a sweat. The music is just a tad off until they use the John Williams theme. All in all it's more like a Diet coke then the real thing. There's a moment with Princess Leia that jolts you back to reality.The movie looks excellent on the big screen and should be seen in a theater with big sound. Fans may be left hungry for more. Don't worry hope for new.",7,0,2,25 January 2017
This Is the End," The end didn't come soon enough
","Here's a date movie if you never want to see that date again.Does indoor soccer with a severed head strike you funny? Screaming about a soiled porn magazine when there is no food or water?Nobody works too hard playing themselves and their perceived on screen image, except Jonah Hill when he's doing Linda Blair. That's about when the movie elevates from foul talking humor to more effective use of the movie format.Parts of the movie look like it was shot on a cell phone. The monsters seemed borrowed from 'Ghostbusters', a far better movie. The script like Franco's pop-up television seemed like it had been sitting around and was not fresh or current.There are laughs, but at times it looked like even the cast was embarrassed by some of what was happening. The movie will be enjoyed most by those on mind dulling drugs.",3,103,204,14 June 2013
Passengers," Romance in space.
","Just when you were expecting a wild science fiction space movie you get a boy meets girl boy looses girl, boy gets girl back movie. The stars are easy to watch and they don't have a lot of company. There is one moral question but ask yourself what would you do? What would Tom Hanks do in Cast Away if he had the option?Seems like a space vehicle that is so sophisticated would not have the technical issues to get the story going and provide the drama. But who wants to see a movie with everyone asleep for another ninety years or so. Clever producers only had to pay two of the 500 passengers on the ship.The movie looks good on the big screen but basically it's a love story that will work well on home platforms. If you see it in a theater Chris Pratt thanks you for attending.",7,13,23,27 December 2016
The Hunger Games," Get a beau with a bow.
","In the dark distant future each of 12 districts send a boy and girl to the ultimate TV survivor show to fight it out till the death. Maybe six districts would have been enough as they quickly kill off a few generic participants. Robin Hood era weapons were an interesting choice.The class warfare in this country is the rich have everything and dress like the cast of Cirque du Soleil and the poor trade everything for food.Katniss takes the place of her little sister and volunteers for the deadly game. In this open competition there are no weight classes or gender delineations, it's to the death and may the odds always be in your favor.Good movies manipulate you and you don't even notice. Gary Ross made you think Seabiscuit was an underdog. Ross is a master manipulator and outstanding story teller.So what if the rules of the game change and two from the same district can survive, until the rules change to 'just kidding'. So what if the hand of the state production company manipulates the tributes around the arena and arbitrarily adds elements; at least they weren't raptors or other dinosaurs that would have been laughable over the top.It's a great time at the movies. There are outstanding performances. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as Katniss. So what if Donald Sutherland is the Donald Sutherland of 'Start the Revolution Without Me'. Where else will you see Woody Harrelson with floppy blonde hair? See this mega-hit that will spawn a franchise. It empowers women. It works for audiences of all age groups, but the reigned in violence may not be appropriate for younger children. Hopefully our society has advanced enough that life will not imitate art and kids won't hunt kids because they got the idea from the movie.",8,2,7,27 March 2012
Zootopia," Disney animation for the entire family.
","The mammals all walk on two feet. They live in a society that is similar to that of people. The mammals are comprised of two groups, reformed vicious predators and the majority of animals who use to be prey. Something sinister is going on.There are a lot of levels to this story which may explain the abundant writing credits. At one level a rabbit wants to be a cop. At another level there is a tolerance message. And there's that power is corrupting message. There also seems to be a don't trust anyone message especially politicians.There may be too much going on for smaller children and it could be frightening. There is plenty for adults to talk about with older children.It is worth noting the movie comes from Disney animation as distinguished from Pixar. It has a more traditional softer look. Take the family to this one there is enough there for the adults and the kids.",7,3,10,14 April 2016
42," Think of 42 reasons to see it.
","42 is more then a baseball movie. In fact a few more sparkling fielding plays would have been welcome. The movie has a great look to it. It captures the time period perfectly and the baseball parks, cars, and clothes always look perfect.It's a story bigger then baseball, but baseball was a reflection of society at the time. Great performances all around. Chadwick Boseman gives a performance equal to Harrison Ford's . Hopefully they will be remembered later in the year.The movie has an old fashioned Disney feel although it's from Warner Bros. Some may find it a tad long or a bit slow, kinda like baseball. It's a true story of a real hero. It's a well done movie that helps you understand why number 42 is the only number retired from all of baseball. See it.",7,3,6,12 April 2013
Argo," Argo see it
","Ben Affleck is stoic, that is polite for devoid of emotion, in the lead role of this almost edge of your seat thriller.If you are old enough to remember or to recall the history of US relations with Iran you'll know in 1979 the US Embassy was seized by what was described at the time as a group of Iranian students. Six Americans make it out and are given sanctuary by the Canadian Ambassador. Based on true events you know the six Americans get out of the country. But until now you don't know the almost real story of their escape. So what if the writers take liberties to heighten the suspense and danger. It's a movie.The Hollywood back story with John Goodman and Alan Arkin is classic. The humor breaks up the tension. Affleck keeps it moving. This is the kind of movie that will build at the box office and will also be included in award season. See it.",8,1,4,18 October 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy, Stupid...like a fox
","Easy to look at. Everyone in this movie is good looking and easy to watch from the main characters to the extras in the bar. Excellent performances all around. Hard to see her character and forget you are looking at Julianne Moore. Marisa Tomei is great,'Cute and sexy'.Like mic shots, when the sound boom shows, this movie had obvious writer shots. Why did she want a divorce? The only reason she was driving the car was so Steve Carell could jump out. One couple photo in the house to break, no family photos to spill the beans?Why the boring too long talk scene in the school hallway except to set up the Marisa Tomei twist. How about have another couple walk out of the class to give the hallway wait credibility. The order of things at the graduation ceremony was convenient. The nude photos, in this day and age, would have been sex text and not printed as needed. Of course the parents didn't tear them up as they were used again late in the movie.Don't sweat the details. There are plenty of chuckles and one hysterical scene that ties everything together. At nearly two hours, it's a tad long for a romantic comedy and you'll guess the resolution in the first five minutes. Don't think too much. Go with it and enjoy.",Null,0,1,19 August 2011
The Danish Girl," Timely story from the 20's
","Eddie Redmayne gives an award worthy performance only exceeded by the performance of Alicia Vikander.. There is some pretty cinematography, a pleasant score and excellent costumes. It's a pretty movie to watch but it moves too slowly. There are some lovely moments but not much pace. The story may not be exactly accurate but it doesn't claim to be a documentary.While the movie looks good on the big screen it may be better enjoyed in the comfort of you own home. Even if at time he looks like a guy in a wig, the subtle gentle Redmayne performance will shine on any size screen.",7,1,2,17 January 2016
Spotlight," Strong performances .
","Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton give award worthy performances as does the strong supporting cast. 'Spotlight' is the story of a group of Boston Globe reporters breaking the story the Catholic Church didn't want exposed.It is dialogue driven with plenty of walk and talks, sit at the Baseball game and talk, talk on the golf course and in the office, and the bar. It is well written and directed. Even if you know where it is going there is an element of suspense.The underlying subject matter will not be popular in some circles, but it is a story that had to be told. It a movie that demonstrates the power of the press and the power of cinema. It's a movie on the small side that doesn't need to be seen on the big screen. The performances will work effectively on home formats.",8,3,8,19 November 2015
Don Jon," Guy flick.
","Don Jon is short of Don Juan, the movie at about 90 minutes seems short of a feature. Many of the scenes are intentionally repeated. The scenes are in front of the computer, at the dinner table, in confessional, in the club, in the car and gym. Like the sister always texting, Don Jon is always doing the same thing. It is almost like a five page script just repeated.Most of the information is communicated in dialogue, on the nose, in the confessional or voice over. The performances are pitch perfect. There are laughs and plenty of almost porn scenes. There is an interesting score.Here's a main character who is always having sex with somebody he loves, himself. With the help of two of the most beautiful women in movies he grows as a person.Don't take your mom unless she was in the Navy.",6,3,8,28 September 2013
Midnight in Paris," Woody's European vacation continues
","Owen Wilson takes the Woody Allen role in this romantic fantasy. You know he's Woody by the voice-overs and that he might get the young girl. Paris is the location and the city has never looked better.Excellent performances all around. Marion Cotillard is a joy to watch. Interesting music sound track with a typical Woody Allen score combined with Cole Porter songs.It is written with heart and humor. It's one of those if you could have dinner with anyone in history who would you choose? Maybe these are the good old days? In this age of too long movies, this is the rare one you wish would have gone longer. It's not Woody's best but it's his best in a long time.",9,5,12,27 May 2011
Youth," This Youth is wasted on all ages.
","If this was the first movie you saw in a theater, you would never go back.Kudos go to the cinematographer for making something so bad look good. The location photography and stunning visuals are not enough to overcome this cinematic dribble.It is dialogue driven with constant walk and talks, sit and talks, eat and talks and lay around and talks. Some of the dialogue is about the ending of a movie planned in the movie. Good news that one won't be made.Performances are subtle as in wasted. The exception is a tea bag drop in of Jane Fonda who has a great three minutes. Of course she like everything else in the movie is more then slightly askew. There was no need to rip her wig off as if the audience didn't know it was a wig.There are good moments. The conducting of the cows was fun. The mass of the directors leading ladies on the hillside was interesting. There is an annoying redundancy including crackling of red cellophane and one to many shots of the wife at the windowIt is always amazing that movies that are too long and too slow have time for a complete song before before the fade out to slow overly long credits.The movie is in limited release and you'll be lucky if it doesn't come to a theater near you. If you see it in a theater for free you will demand your two hours back.",1,26,44,9 December 2015
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Wack a mole.
","It's the cold war era and there seems to be a mole in the top level of British intelligence.Billed as a thriller, there are no thrills. There is no sense of urgency. An excellent British cast marches calmly on with British restraint.The movie is long slow and dialogue driven. Perhaps it is accurate depiction of the spy business but it is not what most people expect and enjoy in a spy movie. Hard to care about any if the characters. If you like to curl up with a good book this might work for you. If you like movies because of what make movies unique you will be bored.",6,0,1,17 December 2011
The Hateful Eight," Hateful nine if you count the Director.
",What we have here is basically eight almost people stranded by the weather at a Wyoming rest stop. There are moments of brilliance. The problem is the moments are hidden in the approximately three hours of mostly great dialogue. A bigger problem is you are asked to spend too many hours with a bunch of unlikeable characters. A bunch of character that lie as often as their lips move.Award worthy performances from the entire cast. The Cinematography is outstanding on the exterior scenes. Too bad there are too few exterior scenes. The Morricone score is a major asset to the production.If you see this be warned it is not a good time at the movies. There is plenty of graphic violence and other uncomfortable to watch scenes. It has it's moments and some unique story telling elements. Since Tarantino took the trouble to shoot this on 70MM film see it on the big screen in 70MM and wish there were more exterior scenes to take advantage of the format.,7,0,10,7 January 2016
Moana," Another princess joins the Disney ranks.
","Moans has to save her world. Don't you think there will be a Disney ending. Rather then a parent dying it's the Grandmother who goes, but she is always with Moana.Every Disney hero has a side kick. Moana has a pig, but mostly a chicken. The movie has an Island score and there are plenty of songs that seem similar. The songs are well performed and the leads are voiced outstanding.The entire family will enjoy the movie. Smaller kids may be scared out of the theater by the villains who are very intense. The movie looks good on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. After it's theatrical run it will get a lot of plays on home platforms.",8,2,19,25 November 2016
The Book Thief," Death spins a yarn.
","Death seemed more like Santa Claus. His narration had him everywhere all the time. Does he have helper death elves?The movie is too long, episodic, but still leaves you asking what was Max doing after he left? So much is invested in his survival but he walks into the night until the death update in the tacked on ending.The movie has a dramatic John Williams score, far from his best work. Perhaps it is the fault of the theater but much of the movie was noticeable very dark.Outstanding performances make this movie a bit more then sugar coated Nazis. With it faults it was probably a better book. World War II Germany was not the happiest place. Death was a bit too jovial. Want a better movie with similar elements try 'The Diary of Anne Frank'.",6,3,12,3 December 2013
Horrible Bosses," Doesn't raise the comedy bar.
","Feels derivative of other recent comedies. Good cast doesn't work too hard. Jennifer Aniston as a dentist is as believable as Cameron Diaz was as an Orthopedist in 'Something About Mary' a far better comedy.Humor is subjective. Shooting people, car crashes, drug use and foul language may not be universally funny. Mentioning better movies in dialogue makes you wish you were watching any Hitchcock movie.If you like your comedy dark, your characters thinly written, you will enjoy this no brain needed entertainment. The outtakes over the end credits looked like those in it had more fun then those of us watching it.",Null,0,0,16 July 2011
Black Mass," Forget light and fluffy.
","Johnny Depp gives a chilling award worthy performance as Whitey Bulger in this violent crime drama.There's a supporting cast of almost too recognizable stars all competing to do their best Boston accents. At times the violence is so extreme it borders on unwatchable. Product placement is a distraction. It's a rough time at the movies, but the Depp performance is worth the price of admission.Along with acting award recognition, the movie deserves technical awards including make-up. The movie plays well with a shared audience. See it in a theater. Be warned the language and violence takes this out of the date movie category.",8,1,6,20 September 2015
The Town," My kinda town
","It works. Ben Affleck plays a likable robber. He personally doesn't seem to hurt anyone. The FBI agent played by Jon Hamm is a worthy antagonist, dedicated to his job. The real old villain gets his in the end, well the front end. Strong performances all around. The heist scenes are the highlight, the exposition talk scenes were often tedious. In one case Ben the director was clever or lucky to have a guy sweeping the street in the background out the window.The film requires more then average suspension of disbelief. Did they really need to take a hostage? Only for this story. The 'uncle apartment' seemed like a line to get the girl into the bedroom but Ben needed the apartment toward the end for the view. Chris Cooper was wasted as his father with one dropped in prison talk scene. The AA like meeting that showed Ben a girl is more important then religion seemed to come out of nowhere.Ben and his crew had access to masks, costumes, ambulances and weapons. They had super intelligence on the background and their victims that made everything too easy. The thick Boston accents that came and went sometimes needed sub titles to understand.The movie is a tad too long but ties up into a neat package that is ultimately satisfying. See it.",8,2,5,22 September 2010
Shutter Island," See it? Skip it? Flush it!
","The only question is this a floater or a sinker? Everything is so heavy from Leo's Boston accent to the set design and the score there is no question it's a sinker. The sets are so over the top at one point Ben Kingsley blames them on a civil war general. The big twist of the story is obvious from the trailer, even from the thirty second TV spot, to anyone over the age of twelve, who has seen a mental hospital movie. In case we needed some exposition Leo meets a women in a cave and he exclaims 'you're the real...' in case we couldn't figure it out. Add in the concentration camp flash backs that would make Tarantino cringe and fifties paranoia, nothing floats. The movie looks good but Marty get your hearing checked.",1,71,150,20 February 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Just what you expect and a tad more
","Looking for an action movie? Here's one. Top supporting cast lifts this above the ordinary. Scarlett Johansson looks better as a blond. Robert Redford looked best with Paul Newman.It's a bit too long as are some of the redundant fight scenes. Don't worry if your favorite character is killed, they seem to reappear.The action is almost non-stop with bullets flying all over and cars flipping and exploding. The movie is a long trailer for the next installment that is introduced during the lengthy end credits.Looking for great cinema look elsewhere. Looking for action and CGI effects this delivers. It is best seen on the big screen.",7,0,1,7 May 2014
Life of Pi," A slice would be better then the whole Pi.
","Ang Lee makes good looking movies. Here again, he is meticulous in his craft and it shows on the screen.The problem with the Life of Pi is it starts too soon and ends too late. Because it is a story in flash back you know PI survives. If you have seen a trailer you know the movie should start with a great ship wreck scene. It takes to long to get there. End after the rescue. That interesting shaggy dog story from the hospital bed that was heard, not seen, was not needed and not cinematic. The movie looks and sounds good but it is redundant. How many storms at sea are enough? The movie might have trouble finding an audience. It looks like a family movie, but it is too violent and intense for younger children. If you go to see it, take your lead from the tiger. When the tiger leaves, you should too.",6,10,45,21 November 2012
Tangled," Instant Disney classic
","Another Disney formula animated feature that works. A new girl power 'Princess' with a cute side kick animal and the wicked (sort of) step mother combine in a hair raising and falling tale.Overlook the male lead is a thief. Throw in a terrific horse named Maximus, assorted softy ruffians and it all comes together in a musical, romantic comedy, adventure.At over ninety minutes it might be a tad long for younger children.Beautiful animation, subtle 3D effects, and a Broadway type musical score, complete with production numbers, make this a treat for kids and adults.",9,2,5,1 December 2010
Interstellar," Stellar performances help this space adventure.
","Interstellar is a great two hour movie, unfortunately it runs nearly three hours. It suffers the written, directed and produced by curse and just goes on way too long. All the credit and the blame goes to Christopher Nolan.The good performances are highlighted by Mackenzie Foy as the young Murph. Middle Murph, Jessica Chastain, works but Ellen Burstyn in the role of old Murph was braver then the characters going into space. Hard to belief Anne Hathaway as an astronaut. Must have been in the Sandra Bullock class at the Academy.Great visuals, early character development to make you care and an often too rousing score all work. After about two hours in you begin to squirm in your seat. There is some 'mumble jumble' science fiction dialogue. The Anne Hathaway character goes with her heart to find Dr. Mann, when found there is no indication of any romance past present or future. When Mathew McConaughey wrestles Dr. Mann it is inter-cut with Murph on Earth too many times. The predictable, we know who has been sending Murph the messages scenes drag on way too long.It's a big movie and deserves to be seen on the big screen. The film print presentation gives a look that has been recently lost in the digital cinema. When you exit the theater you are in need of a breath of fresh air and relieved to find the earth as you left it.",7,3,9,6 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three = ten as ten best lists
","Here's movie that critics and the public will rave about. It is sure to make every critics ten best lists.It starts with a great script. Every character has depth, flaws and virtues. Award worthy performances, and outstanding direction make this dark comedy, drama work. The use of music is outstanding. The movie is in limited release but great reviews and positive audience word of mouth will get this a bigger release. It plays well on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. There are so many reasons to recommend this movie. See it.",9,3,9,10 November 2017
American Sniper," Tense and absorbing
","Bradley Cooper is outstanding as Navy Seal Chris Kyle. Sienna Miller gives a strong performance of the wife left behind. The Clint Eastwood directing and the work of the editor are excellent.After a strong set up there is a flashback to the life growing up followed by the usual harsh training regime scenes. Before too long and we are back to the the nerve testing life of a sniper.If you thought Clint Eastwood music scores were meager previously with three notes, here there are no notes. Some of the most effective scenes are those when Cooper is on the phone with his wife at home.It's a tough movie about a guy doing a tough job. Most of the time he is providing cover for soldiers on the ground. Kyle was a legend and hero to those ground units. Family life was difficult for the tightly wound Seal.It's a powerful movie that plays well on the big screen with big sound. See it in a theater.",9,207,395,11 January 2015
Lion," Lion around waiting for something to happen.
","Some critics will love it. Most audiences will be bored beyond belief. The movie is the story of the very long journey of a young boy separated from his family and his Google search to find his way back to his birth mother.The journey is long redundant and tedious. The performances are convincing but it gets to the point of when will we see the top supporting cast? Once they appear, there is plenty of dialogue. Every character is sad and depressed. If you make it through to the end, you are rewarded with shots of the real people. The snap shots have a far more emotional range then the movie footage. Those staying to the end will know why the title 'Lion'.The only reason to see this in a theater would be to get out of the rain. There is some beautiful cinematography but not enough to justify a theater admission.",3,19,59,6 December 2016
21 Jump Street," Violence and profanity isn't funny
","The target audience for this one seems to be high school boys. The well deserved R rating presents a challenge to get them into the theater.While comedy is subjective, and there are some laughs, the repeated foul language and shooting people isn't funny.Jonah Hill won't get an award nomination for this performance. He puts on the same braces that Ben Stiller wore in 'Something About Mary' a far better comedy. The overall average acting is exposed in a two minute cameo by one of the best actors of our time.The end credit sequence is a total assault on the senses. No need to rush out to see this. It will be just as bad on DVD or cable shortly.",3,37,75,23 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," This weeks super hero Â… next May too.
","It is always fun to see the roots of super heroes. We see the work that turns the physically below average GI Joe into super buff Captain America.Captain America is an old fashioned flag waiving American hero. After a stint on the Bond selling tour he gets his chance to fight. He fights in World War II against the Nazis and the even a more sinister rogue Nazi aptly named The Red Skull.Tommy Lee Jones keeps the film grounded and adds humor, even when some of the action looks more like Star Wars then WWII. A rousing score by Alan Silvestri and a sure to be nominated song by Alan Menken add to the fun.Captain America: The First Avenger deliveries exactly what you expect and want from a summer 'popcorn' movie. Stay through the long end credits and get a glimpse of next summer's sequel that appears to contemporize the story.",Null,1,12,23 July 2011
Rush," Couldn't get much Louda.
",On of the best Grand Prix movies ever made.RUSH is a testosterone race fest. Ron Howard deserves credit for taking a redundant series of races and making them interesting and watchable. Good performances all around. The movie is elevated by an outstanding Hans Zimmer score. Excellent cinematography and ear pounding sound of engines put the viewer in the action.The hospital scenes are a bit tough for the faint of heart. The quiet face to face scene at the end between the competitors takes the movie to a higher level.This one should be seen and heard on a big screen.,7,9,10,2 October 2013
Oblivion," Think live action Wall-E.
","If you are a science fiction fan you will be comfortable with this effort. Much of it seems like you've been there, done that, in other movies.The movie doesn't really get going until the crash and the arrival of 'the other woman'. Nothing like a forced love triangle to throw a science fiction action movie off track. If this isn't your first movie going experience you know when the star gets a cut on the bridge of his nose, it's there for a reason. If one Tom Cruise is good why not have many?The movie is too long with redundant shoot outs with evil faced droid pods. The music is to loud and distracts more then it adds. There's a forced, tacked on Hollywood ending that causes you to question where did that kid come from? Don't question too much as the movie makes up the rules as it goes along.If you are considering seeing this, see it in a theater. It looks good on the big screen and will loose much of it's impact on other platforms.",5,3,9,24 April 2013
Baby Driver," Nobody puts this Baby in a corner.
","Like driving fast with the radio turned up? This movie is for you. Like slickly made well written action films, this s for you. There's a level of violence that might be a problem, but it's more like video game violence or cartoon violence where the coyote comes back for more. Director, writer Edgar Wright gets the credit for creating a unique entertaining world. Ansel Elgort gives an outstanding understated performance as Baby. The supporting cast is right on even if some are so well known you feel like you are watching Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx rather then the characters they play.The technical aspects are award worthy. The sound and sound editing are amazing. The cinematography outstanding. The art direction and costume design add to the slick look. The use of music makes the movie.The movie looks great on the big screen. Enjoy it in a theater environment with big sound.",9,12,21,7 July 2017
Man of Steel," Steal away with this man of steel
","If you didn't know it was summer, now you know with this summer blockbuster. It is a fresh retelling of the comfortable Man from another planet coming to earth story. The movie has a lot of heart and the best use of flashbacks ever in telling what it is like to grow up 'different'. It is tough to be adopted and from another planet.Excellent performances all around. Henry Cavill has the body if not the range. Michael Shannon is a strong villain trying to save his people at the expense of those here on earth.It feels a tad long. The fighting and destruction scenes get redundant and drag on too long. The quiet moments are outstanding.Great retelling and reselling of the Superman story. See it on the big screen.",8,1,2,22 June 2013
The Revenant," Winner best use of a horse.
","Unless you've been in a cave, you know this is the story of a frontiersman mauled by a bear and left by his comrades to die. It is a classic man against nature survival story. Add in bad guy French trappers, mostly hostile Native Americans and greedy deceitful individuals that round out the characters.The real star is the environment. It is beautifully photographed. Plenty of ice, snow, running water and wind in the trees. The fact that this movie was made in obvious treacherous locations is just amazing.Leonardo DiCaprio had best clear space on his mantel for all the awards he will pick up for this performance. In a time of dialogue driven movies, he is too cold, too alone and too hurt to say much. His performance is all over his frosted face. Tom Hardy is a bit of a one note bad guy. Will Poulter, best in 'We're the Millers' was distractingly miscast.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu deserves the credit for getting this made and making it in what seemed like unworkable conditions. Unfortunately the hand of the director is felt more then once in distracting flashbacks and the now signature Inarritu levitation of characters. The movie is too long, yet some things seemed rushed. Why did the Pawnee Indian leave DiCaprio except for a dramatic highly staged later scene? Why didn't the Captain take more men to track and capture Fitzgerald? The writer and director and the audience knew it would come down to a DiCaprio, Hardy fight at the end. The unsubtle tattoo on the girl and the marking on the canteen are fodder for future satire. See this in a theater on the biggest screen available. There is a turn your stomach level of violence and gore. It may not be a good time at the movies, but it is remarkable movie making.",8,1,3,20 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Expect better from Spielberg.
",Here's a bloated lack of action full of talk from the Director of some really great movies. If you know the story you know the outcome. If you don't know the story you know nothing bad will happen to Tom Hanks. Maybe a John Williams score could have helped this but he didn't get the job. The movie is too long. It takes a long time getting going and you'll be looking at your watch wondering when is something going to happen.If you like 1956 and 1957 Chevrolets this movie is for you. The car is everywhere including East Berlin and even at the bridge in the title. It looks like the same 1956 car appears in different locations in the first sequence. You know a movie is not captivating if you are looking for product placement or movie cars.A couple of good performances make this bearable. There is a scene near the end where the kids call their mother into the room to watch the news story. Seems odd that they knew what was coming and laughable they would call in their parents.The Janusz Kaminski Cinematography looks good on the big screen. Maybe if you lower your expectations you won't be too disappointed. Looking for a great Spielberg movie skip this and watch 'Jaws' 'Munich' 'Schindler's List' 'Raiders' or almost anything but 'Lincoln'.,4,15,29,19 October 2015
Hugo," Didn't anyone say 'cut'.
","Here's a film that looks great. Outstanding Art Direction and Set Design.The pre-title sequence is a wonderful race through the train station. The other chases through the station are pale and redundant compared to the first romp.While the movie is appropriate for children, how long is too long? Seems like in this case more is less. It seemed like at least thirty minutes could be trimmed and the movie going experience improved.The cast serves the material well. Ben Kingsley may be too big a star and hard to get past and accept him as his character. The real theme is film preservation with plenty of interesting silent era classic clips.Except for the opening and a few good dog shots it's not worth the 3D up-charge. Two plus hours viewing through smudged glasses and projection equipment that doesn't put out enough light hurts the format. There is no reason to watch classic silent clips in 3D.Look for the movie to receive plenty of technical nominations as it gets lost in the holiday box office derby. Pass this Hugo.",5,3,8,9 December 2011
Warrior," Take a kick to your gut.
","If you liked 'Rocky', 'The Fighter', 'Raging Bull', and 'The Wrestler' this movie is for you. If you liked 'Turning Point' or 'The Red Shoes', this may not be for you.Well written with enough back story to make you care about the characters. The cartoon character villains are quickly dispensed with in the cage. Excellent performances all around. Nick Nolte may have been trying too hard for a supporting actor award. A written and directed by situation may be why the movie runs well over two hours.Sports movies are a tough sell. This one deserves to be seen by a wide audience. If nothing else it proves there is an alternative to resolving family issues besides Dr. Phil. You'll cheer, you'll cry and enjoy the experience.",Null,0,5,16 September 2011
Salt," Action 7...emotion 0
","Interesting premise about sleeper agents that wake up.Jolie runs, she jumps, she fights, and she shoots, so often it becomes tedious. The same is true of the loud score over every action scene. Looped dialogue keeps you up to speed.Cartoon characters lack depth. The few flashbacks are more laughable then insightful.It's good to have a spider keeper husband just in case you need special venom. Sometime you have to kill the generic Secret Service protection to save the President and the world.The door was left open for a sequel. Suggest you restrict your Salt intake.",3,20,42,23 July 2010
We're the Millers," Spend some quality time with this fake family.
","If you're craving great cinema look elsewhere. If your looking for laughs and a good time at the movies this delivers.Buy popcorn and check any need for reality at the door. So much of what happens seems created to set up the jokes. The biggest stretch is an easel and enough light from the campfire to play a drawing game while camping. The movie is 'R' rated primarily for language. There is plenty of slang for body parts. It's a tad long. It is the kind of movie that screams there will be outtakes, and they start quickly after a fade to black. The performances won't win any awards but everyone is easy to watch. The movie meets the main criteria of the genre, it delivers a variety of laughs. Share the fun. See it.",7,2,5,13 August 2013

The writing is award caliber. Excellent original score and good use of music.ignore a few flaws, concerning the Eagle player not yet an Eagle. Or the line about putting in a ballet bar, when there already is a ballet bar. The drugs sure must have worked as the Cooper character does a 360.Spend some time this Holiday season with a family more messed up then your own.

Dunkirk," War is still hell.
","Edwin S. Porter's 'The Great Train Robbery' was the first use of parallel action. Something happening off camera while different action is on camera. Christopher Nolan the Dunkirk director took the concept to the extreme. The problem was time stood still for the action not shown. When they cut back to the previous scene no time had passed.It is an intense movie, but the characters are nearly random. It was shot on film and looks good. A slew of technical nominations will come it's way. Think sound, sound editing. It is hard to recommend to anyone looking for a good time at the movies. If you want to see it, see it on the big screen in a theater with big sound. If you forgot war is hell, this will remind you.",6,1,7,27 July 2017
The Intouchables," A small gem that sparkles
","Other then 'Driving Miss Daisy' the relationship between a care-giver and his patient is not the kind of story that comes out of Hollywood. That's why when you see this gem you'll be reading sub-titles.There's an award worthy performance by Omar Sy in role of the care-giver. Outstanding use of music that is melded into the story.At times the sub-titles blend into the background and are hard to read. The movie is a tad too long. There is a lack of father daughter relationship in the movie that already seems to have been left on the cutting room floor.It not the kind of story that draws a wide audience. In the summer season of rehashed super heroes and explosions, a story about humanity and friendship is not going to attract a large audience. The movie is in limited release but seek it out.",8,0,1,2 June 2012
Bad Teacher," Choose detention over this one.
","It's a long 92 minutes with this one gag movie. Think 'Bad Santa' teaches high school.Too much of the time you feel the hand of the writer. Start with character names Amy Squirrel and Principal Snur.The motivation of the bad teacher to become the good teacher rings false when she changes her mind in a no twist, twist. Falling for the gym teacher wasn't going to happen but the writers forced it. The conversation about four dogs may have made for a funny scene but it was only conversation, unless something was left on the cutting room floor.The target audience of high school boys should not be allowed in the theater because of the 'R' rating earned mostly for foul language. My advice, ditch school.",5,2,6,1 July 2011
The Lego Movie," A Lego up on the competition
","Here's a movie based on a toy plastic building brick. Of course the early trailers looked lame and what are they thinking? Now the movie arrives and dominates the box office, because it is good. Not too intense for kids and enough jokes for adults. There is a break neck pace, and a color assault on the senses. There's a catchy song and well voiced characters. There is even a fun twist that gives a sense of reality to the whole deal. Here's a movie for the entire family. The 3D works and is worth the up charge. See it. Based on the box office success expect more Lego movies in the future.",8,0,2,19 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," This club is not for everyone.
","Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto lost the weight and give award worthy performances. McConaughey is tough and angry. Leto gets deep into the fabric of the role as Rayon.If you go to the movies to see great performances join the 'Club'. If you want a good time and a feel good movie, this isn't it.The movie is and feels long with plenty of redundant drinking and drug use scenes. McConaughey carries this movie on his back, sometimes it is obvious how hard he's working. There are a couple of quiet reflective moments with Jennifer Garner that slow things to a snails pace. The photography fits the mood. There is an outstanding scene of butterflies.No rush to see this one in a theater as it will play well at home on various platforms.",6,2,10,31 October 2013
Now You See Me," Don't expect movie magic.
","OK movie, as long as you don't think too much. Need a cadaver? No problem.Start with the cast. Jesse Eisenberg is cocky and too fast talking. Mark Ruffalo is calm and scruffy. Isla Fisher is screechy, like chalk on a blackboard. Dave Franco is the wrong Franco. Melanie Laurrent doesn't have the chops. Woody Harrelson seems to be making an effort and he steals every scene. The two old stars sleep walk through their parts.Like magic, film editing should be seamless. In this movie the editing is noticeable and distracting. Fast pace takes you from Las Vegas, to New Orleans and New York but why?If you suspend your disbelief big time and sit back and take the ride it's an OK trip. About an hour after the end credits you think back and think did I miss something and they hypnotized me into thinking this was a good movie. It should have been better.",6,1,4,5 June 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Meets expectations.
",If Batman and Superman can fight seems only fair this group of Super Heroes would duke it out in civil war. Pick a side or vacillate like most of the characters. The movie is big and loud. It is an assault on the viewers senses.Great cast seems like they are having fun. Along with nearly nonstop action even the comedy moments work. The Tony Stark meeting with Spider Man steals the show.Most of the recent gang of heroes are there. Maybe they needed a Hulk. He might have been off with Pepper Potts.So the audience is asked to choose sides. These heroes have done away with so many bad guys they are left with nothing to do but fight among themselves. Hard to be more then an impartial observer when you don't want to root for or against Iron Man or Captain America.The movie is too long and after the opening standard action sequence it seems to take some time to get going. There are plenty of redundant fights. And one awe kiss.It's a big movie that should be seen on the big screen. The 3D was often subtle and isn't worth the up charge or sitting in glasses for three hours including trailers. If you are a fan of this genre you won't be disappointed.,6,1,4,11 May 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Too much of a good thing.
","Fresh, fun, forgettable.Not very PC, but Scott is a character that is fun to hang with. Unfortunately he has to defeat 7 evil X's. That's just too many. Written and directed by syndrome causes it to drag. Thanks for sparing us that final epic of epicness battle.With the exception of an early dance segment Cera shows his usual limited range. The bands fun music eventually becomes an ear pounding assault. The movie has that not quite right look like it was shot digitally. Different and entertaining for about 80 minutes too bad it runs 112.",4,16,34,18 August 2010
Inside Out," Great concept. Brilliant execution.
","Here' is something new and unique from Pixer Animation. It is the story of the voices inside the head of Riley and what happens when the family moves from Minnisota to San Francisco. Joy, Anger and Sad are the star emotions. A brilliant script, superb animation and amazing character voice performances make this an outstanding movie.The movie is suitable for the entire family. Young children may have trouble grasping the premise but it is perfect for older kids and their parents.See it in a theater and catch the Pixer short with the feature. 'Lava' is a thing of beauty. It is not to early to predict both the feature and the short will be mentioned in award season.",10,5,26,19 June 2015
The Fault in Our Stars," Sad
","If you need a good cry, this movie is for you. You know going in you're going to a 'this can't last long' love story.In addition to using every sad trick in the current dying youth arsenal this effort goes beyond and even calls on Anne Frank references in case there is still a dry eye the house.Perhaps the movie works too hard and too long to use one more Kleenex. How many 'eulogy' scenes does one character need? Good thing Hazel or Gus didn't have a dog or it wouldn't have made it through the movie.The performances are easier to watch then the subject matter. The young leads will be mentioned in Golden Globe circles. Laura Dern, the second best actor in her family gets better with age. William Dafoe can't be as bad as written. His one sour note performance and implausible popping in as the mail man felt contrived.A good score and use of the Amsterdam locations lift spirits.Dealing with cancer, the death of a child, and the loss of a friend are tough subjects to explore. Perhaps the movie is actually soft and romantic compared to the truth. After all as Tom Cruise once said, 'you can't handle the truth'.",6,7,14,18 June 2014
To Rome With Love," The European tour continues
","Rome didn't look as good as Paris. 'To Rome with Love' isn't as good as 'Midnight in Paris'.Woody Allen is back in front of the camera with an age appropriate wife, there's something different.The movie is a series of comedy skits pieced together using the city of Rome as a background. It says Rome and shows the famous streets, fountains and steps but the skits could take place in Chicago.The cast is good. Nobody seems to be working too hard while working on vacation in Italy. The skits very and you soon wish to stay in one place perhaps more then go to the Alec Baldwin as Harvey the Rabbit in the Ellen Page enough already segments.The episodic nature makes things uneven and it suffers a little from the written and directed by syndrome. It could be shorter and tighter.Woody Allen fans will enjoy it. It has good number of laughs. It will not make it into the best of Woody Allen retrospect.",7,2,9,1 July 2012
Bridesmaids," Harmless entertainment
","The ads and trailers tell you what to expect and that's what is delivered. A female driven comedy. As the star and writer Kristen Wiig deserves a lot of credit and some of the blame for this one.The male characters in the script are dull, flatly written, or in one case just a jerk.The humor will not always appeal to everyone. Some people my not appreciate the barf and worse in the bathroom.The movie feels long at over two hours and individual scenes seem to go on longer then necessary. How many times have we seen the drunk on an airplane? There were some cute bits in the jewelry store. The puppy favors was good for a laugh.It's a harmless summer escape. Go with her to this one. Then you can drag her to 'Hangover 2'.",6,1,4,19 May 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Long Hobbit road trip.
","A few dwarfs survive to regroup and take back their kingdom. If fantasy adventure is your genre, this Hobbit deliveries.Check logic at the door. Where are the women? The only way to tell the good guys from the bad guys is the bad guys always seem more fierce and ugly. Just when you think the dwarfs can't escape the cliffhanger of the moment something or someone comes to their rescue, again and again. In the final sequence when it appears there is no escape, giant birds swoop in for the save. Maybe you thought the trees would turn into firemen? Giant birds save the day. Go figure.The movie is too long for all and way too intense for younger viewers. Great costumes, sets and makeup are interesting. Good cinematography and a great score will be noticed in award season.See it for a fantasy fix. You may not not leave the theater satisfied when you discover you have been watching a nearly three hour trailer for the next episode.",6,6,13,25 December 2012
Non-Stop," Not quite non stop action.
",The term suspension of disbelief required here.Liam Neeson plays a character flawed Air Marshall. He disables the lavatory smoke detector. Julianne Moore becomes the side kick. (Sandra Bullock would have landed the plane.)The movie resets the clock every twenty minutes as those aboard the plane are killed on schedule. Soon you wish they were killing people on a ten minute schedule. Maybe they needed to illuminate the 'fasten your seatbelt' sign to stop the killings? The one plane location gets a bit claustrophobic. Some scenes look like they were shot on a cel phone.Any flight you walk away from is a good flight. So what if the plane blows up and crashes. So what if the movie is unbelievable it is a good time while watching. Get a boarding pass and take this flight.,7,0,4,28 February 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A delight for Wes Anderson fans.
","Wes Anderson has a distinct style. He's movies have a look and his actors perform in a style that is almost cartoon like. Perhaps it is how they run in the frequent chase scenes.If you like Wes Anderson's style you will like this latest effort. It's a story about a guy telling a story about a guy telling a story plus or minus a guy telling a story. It is great fun trying to recognize the array of stars going through their paces.The film is bright and looks good on the big screen except he keeps messing with the screen size and aspect ratio depending on which guy is telling the story. There's a fast pace uplifting score. The cinematography makes every scene look like a greeting card.Anderson fans will stand and cheer, most everyone else will have a pleasant time at the movies.",6,0,8,20 March 2014
Foxcatcher," Make like a fox and run from this one.
","Here's a movie that will make a lot of lists. Maybe a ten best list, for sure a ten worst list.The movie is way too long. It starts too early in the story and takes too long to get to the Du Pont mansion. Nearly ever scene begins early and ends late. Du Pont walks toward his training facility, the scene begins after he walks through the door. The training scenes are redundant. The movie is dialogue driven with too much attention given to the reaction shot, usually a blank stare. Often we are spared the dialogue by shooting through a window or watching the scene from a different room, a gimmick used too often.It's a story about a guy looking for love and respect from his mother. It ain't gonna happen.Hang a fake nose on Steve Carell and paste on a permanent scowl will not get an acting award. Channing Tatuim equals his performance in 'Magic Mike'. Mark Ruffalo tries his best to carry things along.There are good movies and bad movies. This one is just annoying. No need to see it in a theater. You can turn it off at home.",1,33,70,8 December 2014
Gone Girl," Gone off the rails Girl
","Here's a fun movie. If you think you are in a bad relationship see what Nick Dunne has to endure.There are a few problems. How did the cat get into the bedroom? How did a supposedly tied up Amy get that box cutter? Why would the successful Neil Patric Harris character have no life? They don't have showers in the hospital?A similar 'bad girl' in 'Body Heat' had more motivation. Here the leading lady was more like a female Norman Bates.The movie has a great setup. The flashback of the leads meeting and romancing with the sugar cloud makes both character likable. As things progress you are yanked around by a clever story and your attitude towards the characters changes.At two and a half hours it is a tad long. There are giant holes and some things feel forced, but it is entertaining. It plays well in the dark on the big screen. See it in a theater.",8,1,8,7 October 2014
Django Unchained," Awfully good.
","Quintin Tarentino is one of the most interesting writer directors working today. So what if he exhibits signs of Attention Defecit Disorder and his movies seem to wander and change course about half way through and never seem to end when they should. 'Django Unchained' is 'Inglorious Bastards' set in the pre-civil war south. The Jews are replaced by Blacks and Nazies by Plantation Owners. If you don't have Hitler to kill take revenge on Leonardo DiCaprio's well acted Candie Land owner.The movie is an homage to the Italian Western of the 60's. It has the appropriate titles, music and cinematography. All that was missing was out of sync dubbed dialogue.Christoph Waltz is outstanding as the Bounty Hunter who needs and partners with Django. His horse deserves a nod.You just know it is a black comedy, especially when Tarentino shows up with bad hair and a worse accent towards what seems like a tacked on sequence needed for a tacked on ending.The violence is extreme but about average for a Tarentino movie. Well written, acted, and directed. It's well worth your time and money.",9,3,9,5 January 2013
Drive," Tighten your seat belt
","Ryan Gosling has a tooth pick in his mouth, as he plays the Clint Eastwood type of stoic character with no past and no name. Not a lot of dialogue but plenty of shut your eyes violence.Excellent performances all around. Albert Brooks is outstanding in an unexpected role.Interesting direction, at times the awkward nothing happening between characters is what is happening. Outstanding editing and sound. Interesting use of a score and placement of songs.Tight, gritty movie that doesn't pull any punches. If you can get past the graphic violence you'll see an outstanding movie that will soon be considered a classic of the genre.",Null,2,9,16 September 2011
The Theory of Everything," Redmayne yes, Everything no.
","'Where there is life there's hope.' Not much hope for this biopic presented in a one octave range. Eddie Redmayne gives an award worthy contorted performance. Felicity Jones is static and doesn't seem to age.Gimmick choices were made that distract rather then add to the movie. There is a funky use of color on occasions that makes you think you are watching a faulty digital presentation.The fireworks seen in the trailer are about the only fireworks in the movie,. The side ways image on the poster is a clue they are looking for gimmicks in all areas.No need to see this in a theater. The small budget is apparent on the big screen, and this may be more appropriate as a TV drama. Even Redmayne's performance can't carry this too long, too dull effort.",5,6,15,19 November 2014

","Here's a small budget movie that will top the lists of 10 Best of the year. Award worthy performances make it work. While Bri Larson is excellent and billed as the lead, Jacob Tremblay carries the movie. It is really his story. He is on screen in nearly every scene and does all the voice overs. It is the discovery of the world through his eyes that raise the movie above harsh drama.The writer gets the credit for the good and perhaps the blame for some things that were so heavy handed red flags nearly popped off the screen. Perhaps it was better developed in the book but the William H. Macy character and issue felt rushed and distracting. The Dr. handing out sleeping pills when sleeping wasn't an issue was a jolting red flag. The news reporter interview was so far in bad taste to be realistic. Both mom and attorney sat by to set up another unlikely scene. The male characters were all written as insensitive clods. That includes the male cop. Even the male dog while kind sure wasn't much to look at.Ignore the flaws and admire the performances. The movie may be hard for some to take as it deals with abuse issues and aftermath. It is in limited release so if you can't see it in the dark, it will be almost as effective on a home platform. See it somewhere as it one of the best movies of the year.",9,1,6,22 January 2016
22 Jump Street," One ups the other one.
","It is rare for a sequel to be better then the original even when the original isn't original. Here Tatum and Hill go to college to solve a crime. There are a couple of surprises that don't surprise but the effort is there.They aren't Butch and Sundance but the leads seem comfortable together. They had a bigger budget then the previous and it shows on the screen in the form of locations, stunts and extras. There are enough laughs and some action. If they took out the 'F' bombs it would be a silent movie. If you are a looking for a summer popcorn movie this is for you. It's a tad long. The end credits predicting plenty of sequels is fun. This will hang around theaters for many weeks and have a good run on other platforms.",6,2,6,27 June 2014
Unknown," Go to it and just go with it.
","Embrace the exposition at the airport. Forget that the required set-up of the left behind briefcase and car accident is too unbelievable. Smile at 'Prince Shada is having a reception and we all have to go.' Don't compare it with 'Taken' as it lacks the stakes of that story. Liam Neeson is excellent as always. Good supporting cast all around although Diane Kruger is a bit uneven and Frank Langella is practically a cameo.The movie has that drab shot on video look. Perhaps the sun never comes out in Berlin.Plenty of car chases and crashes abound. It works as a action, mystery, thriller. Fun ride. Take it.",8,2,9,19 February 2011
Ex Machina," We haven't seen the last of Ava.
","Here's a slick tight sci-fi movie that puts artificial intelligence in an attractive package. It works because it is absorbing and the character, are interesting and actually likable.Good performances all around, but nobody is asked to stretch at an emotional level. Artificial intelligence is always played at a cool calm collected level and Ava, played by Alicia Vikander fills the bill. Most of the time the story plays indoors but there is a field trip to a great waterfall.Written and directed by Alex Garland, he deserves the credit for taking a Twilight Zone premise and turning it into an absorbing feature length movie. There is an appropriate score that gets too loud on occasion. The ending screams a sequel is coming. Look for 'Ava in the City' or 'Ava the Almost Girl Next Door'. It would be sad to think we were watching a giant trailer for the next installment. This is actually a small personal movie that will play well on home platform after it's deserving successful theatrical run. Spend some time with Ava. She may be artificial but she's a charmer.",8,1,7,13 May 2015
Grudge Match," Rocky vs Raging Bull?
","Here's a good natured comedy. The premise of a grudge match for the AARP title allows for a lot of predictable jokes and this movie delivers. De Niro shows why he is among the best actors around. Stallone shows why he is best playing the Rocky like role he created. Alan Arkin is Arkin like and it.is good to see Kim Bassinger again.The plot is on the thin side but the idea is high concept with the two stars and they carry the movie. There are plenty of jokes and most of them work.Don't split too fast after a split decision. There are a couple of fun added scenes during the credits that should not be missed. If you are looking for serious cinema this isn't it. If you are looking for a fun popcorn movie, see it.",7,1,4,8 January 2014
Hidden Figures," Has a number of things going for it.
","Here's a movie about numbers and three girls with sharp pencils. Hard to believe the space program relied in manual calculations before NASA got their computers up and running.Excellent performances make this work. There is a nice score and plenty of fifty era Chevys. The number of vintage Chevys polished and lined up in the parking lot is humorous.At two hours plus, the movie is and feels to long. Seems like about twenty minutes could be cut. It seems it is wandering at times. The movie lacks urgency. A highlight is the passing of chalk.There is no need to see this in a theater. For the most part, it's a small but important story that will work well on home platforms.",6,9,34,25 December 2016
Lincoln," Better car then movie.
","Starts with a brutal hand to hand combat, Civil War battle. Turns into mouth to mouth battles of long angry speeches.Daniel-Day Lewis looks the part but may not sound the part as he gives an outstanding award worthy performance. Sally Field plays crazy like Sally Field. Tommy Lee Jones gives good speeches.If you like dialogue driven movies you'll like Lincoln. The most effective scene toward the end had no dialogue as Lincoln rode through a battle field. Proof movies are visual and meant to be seen and not heard.It may not be historically accurate but it's not a documentary. Don't go to the theater tired as it is too long and often slow. The movie works best on a rainy afternoon or a DVD at home.",6,8,21,17 November 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Men who give pigs a bad name
","Noomi Rapace plays Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I don't know why she has it or where she got it, because the US version of the film is only 152 minutes. Perhaps it is in the Swedish version at 180 minutes or for sure it must be in the book.If you don't know from the US title you are seeing 'Men Who Hate Women' you sure find out fast. One guy is a sadistic rapist pig and he isn't the worst of the lot.Art imitates life when Lisbeth takes a golf club to a guy and his SUV. Like Tiger Wood's wife, if you are into punk this girl is a nineteen. That's a ten with a nine iron.At 152 minutes there is plenty of time for story and back story to explain almost everything. Still there are holes that you can drive a truck through and you have to wonder why the police hadn't solved the old murder cases with the evidence there for the two super sleuths to patiently uncover.The movie is dark and it looks on the dark dreary side with color that is just enough off to make the white snow blueish. The score is often loud and warns of foreboding. It's a film that makes you appreciate the genius of Hitchcock and the scores of Bernard Herman.If murder, rape, incest, mutilation and graphic violence is your idea of a good time at the movies you will not be disappointed. See it on an empty stomach. Every family has skeletons in the closet but this group could fill the haunted mansion.",8,3,8,21 April 2010
Big Hero 6," Big hero 6 maybe a 4.
","Do you like Disney animated movies? You know the kind with beautiful animation with a hero with a cute sidekick? And a few award worthy songs? If that is what you expect from a Disney animated movie, get ready to be disappointed.Big Hero 6 lacks any of the charm associated with the Disney brand. It seems like they picked this up at a Japanese animation garage sale. Be warned, the movie deals with the death of a sibling. If you take younger children to see it, be prepared to explain puberty.There is a limited amount of likability to the overstuffed marshmallow, but I doubt he will be on any kids want list. The movie is a frenetic assault on the senses. The main character appears to be on sugar overload much of the time.Looking for a Disney classic the whole family will enjoy? Skip Big Hero and watch 'Frozen' 6 more times.",4,65,175,28 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Big Marvel movie delivers.
","Here an unusual group of heroes get together to save the Galaxy. Good performances all around. If you liked Zoe Saldana when she was blue you'll like her green. Bradley Cooper as Rocket likes to steal things and his performance steals every scene.The movie contains a 'Star Wars' Death Star type plot and assorted bad and worse guys. There is plenty of who's fighting who sci-fi action but the movie works best when it isn't taking itself too seriously. The satire provides many light moments.Don't worry if you can't keep track of what's happening as there is plenty of dialogue exposition to tell you why, where and what the heroes have to do next.The movie should be enjoyed on the big screen with big sound. If you stay through the lengthy credits you'll get to see a cameo by a little remembered character from a flop movie from 1986. A big box office assures we will see more of these Gaurdians of the Galaxy.",8,2,4,1 August 2014
The Imitation Game," Top Notch
",Here's a well made bio pick. You want stakes in a movie? How about we must defeat Nazi Germany. And defeat them fast as Allie Ships are being sunk in record numbers.Benedict Cumberbatch gives an award worthy performance. There may be an issue understanding the English accents for the first few minutes.The movie deals with worthwhile themes and and moves slickly between three time periods. It makes math interesting and even though you know who won the war it is still interesting and tense.It is a small movie that doesn't need to be seen in a theater as it will play well on a home platform. See it.,9,5,13,30 December 2014
Jurassic World," Dinosaurs ten people six.
",Delivers what you expect. The dinosaurs are outstanding the people not as much. A couple of the Velociraptors showed a border acting range then the mostly stiff Bryce Dallas Howard.The dinosaur action and mayhem is top notch. The signature poster scene with Chis Pine leading the pack is great. Some of the action rather then shocking is laughable. Things go a bit too far with a Godzilla battle.There was just enough John William's music to wish for more. Speaking of more there was plenty of room left for another installment as eggs and birds left the Island.This is a big summer movie that should be seen in a theater. The bigger the screen and louder the sound the better.,8,6,19,13 June 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," It's not a Chiropractor organization.
","It's a fantasy, love story as Matt Damon falls for Emily Blunt, a situation that is not in the plan.The 'chairman' has his agents to make adjustments if things aren't going along a planned path. Some of the adjustments are tweaks some are much more serious.The movie requires some serious suspension of disbelief. It could have been a comedy but it is played straight. Plenty of chases and fun locations. Some familiar cable news faces add credibility while they deliver large doses of exposition.It's entertaining, especially early. Damon and Blunt have good chemistry and the movie is best when they are together.",6,1,5,4 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," Would Mel Gibson have made it more offensive?
","If you can't take the heat don't go back into this kitchen. The Wolf pack is back more raunchy then before. There is something here to offend almost everyone. The first 'Hangover' had a certain charm and freshness along with the raunch. The freshness is gone, the charm has wained and we are left with raunch.If you like 'Hangover' you'll like H2 as it is the same movie in a different location. The likable characters are all back and the plot is almost identical. One change, the tiger was replaced by a drug dealing smoking monkey (who looked like the monkey in the Pirate franchise.)If dialogue containing the 'f' word was deleted it would be a silent movie.The pictures in the camera over the end credits showed it could have been considerable more raunchy. Those responsible showed good judgment by not using Mel Gibson or ping pong ball scenes.",7,1,2,1 June 2011
Logan," Plenty of action, just enough heart.
",if you can get past the graphic violence which is at a nearly laughable level there is a good story that takes advantage of established and new characters.The dispensing of generic bad guys gets a little redundant and perhaps the movie could have been a bit shorter if not so many were graphically eliminated.Hugh Jackman is an outstanding actor with many talents. Too bad it would be out of character to expect the Wolverine to sing. Perhaps one day there will be an X-men the musical.If you're a fan of the franchise this might be your favorite of the series. If this is your first venture into this genre there is plenty to like. The movie looks great on the big screen and should be seen in a theater environment with big sound. It delivers the goods and as long as you remember it is comic book violence it is a good time at the movies.,8,0,3,4 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Delivers what is expected.
","It is never easy to save the world. It takes a great cast in familiar roles. Each super hero is given enough time to do his thing. The most interesting character belongs to Mark Ruffalo who reminds us it's not easy to be green. With all the chaos and destruction there are times when Scarlett Johansson and Ruffalo are in their own can I bring him home to meet my parents love story. It is not clear what Johansson's super power is except motor cycle.driving with the help of a stunt person, and seduction where she needs no help.The movie deliveries just what you are expecting from the franchise. The only thing missing was Pepper Potts. The are an abundance of fights between good and evil even if some times you aren't sure which is which.It's a big movie and the budget is on the screen. See it in a theater. The bigger the screen and the louder the sound the better. The success of this movie means the crew will be back to fight more evil and save the world again soon.",8,1,4,16 May 2015
Friends with Benefits," Harmless popcorn movie
","From the title and trailers you know what to expect. No surprises.Starts off fast enough with a couple of quick break-ups, a cute airport scene and snappy dialogue. It moves right along into the bedroom.Things go south fast when the action, or lack of action, moves to California. Major tone change when the Timberlake character has to deal with his ill father.Kunis and Timberlake, show more skin then acting range. No doubt they had more fun then the audience. Woody Harrelson is outstanding in his gay role and steals ever scene in which he appears.Fluff formula romantic comedy that doesn't ask much of the viewer. There's an after credit 'outtake' scene that spoofs the practice.",Null,0,1,8 August 2011
Puss in Boots," Top cat
","Here's a beautifully animated movie for the whole family. Kids are glued to the screen, adults are not tortured, and actually will enjoy it. Plenty of family values. Well voiced by an outstanding cast. Fitting traditional and contemporary musical score. No interruptions by songs that don't work.Perhaps a bit too long for the youngest family members. The bad egg gets too much screen time. Good use of 3D especially early in the movie. Kids in the audience reached out to pet the animals. Eventually you forget you are wearing glasses and they seem like there was less reason to have them and the up-charge.Think Zorro played by a smooth cat. Already reaching classic status. See it.",Null,0,1,7 November 2011
Elysium," Bad at every genre.
",Start with a title your're not sure how to pronounce and won't remember. Add the written and directed by effect of being too long with redundant fights and shooting scenes. Matt Damon is stiff. Jodie Foster is an embarrassment to her former self with an annoying fake accent.The movie takes place about forty years in the future when Los Angeles is covered with graffiti and most of the population speaks Spanish. That is science fiction? The fight scenes offer nothing new. There is a loud pounding music score that tries to add importance but just distracts.One good scene has the Damon character talking to his beat up parole officer robot. The scene was intentionally funny as distinguished from scenes that were unintentionally funny.Characters you don't care about struggle to get health care. Don't waste your time or money on this one.,2,4,12,14 August 2013
Alice in Wonderland," Girl Power Alice
","It is always interesting to see the world through Tim Burrton's eyes. This time the world is wonderland. It takes a few minutes to get there, but like when Dorothy arrived in Oz we are treated to a special world with all sorts of interesting characters that are familiar yet new.So what if the Red Queen looks like she was left over from 'Mars Attacks'. Johnny Depp is the maddest of the hatters. The Cheshire cat's grin is infectious and the blue caterpillar takes full advantage of the 3D effects. New creatures to tame and ride, a talking dog, a talking horse all seem reasonable in this world. The level of violence and too many needles into eyes may not be appropriate for younger children.Alice shrinks, grows and grows along her journey in this girl power classic. Tim Burton turns a tea party into a feast for the eyes. Enjoy it in 3D.",8,1,5,11 March 2010
The Artist," A few words sez it all in this gem.
","Tired of big budget effects driven movies? Had your fill of dialogue driven movies that seem like plays? Do you long for the simpler days of stories set in Hollywood complete with Hollywood endings? The premise is 'A Star Is Born' but it's the flawless execution that makes this movie a unique joy. It's in high contrast Black and White, with almost no dialogue, presented in a retro aspect ratio.The stars, Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, not well known in the USA, are outstanding. Bejo lights up the screen and is sure to garner a Best Supporting Actress nomination. The supporting cast includes more familiar faces. The dog is terrific.Cinematography awards were previously divided into color and black & white, here it's perfect black & white. The score is a homage to movie music of the past and works to maintain the mood. There is interesting use of sound when needed.Perhaps silent films were grainier and exhibition prints may have had change-over cues missing from this pristine digital replica. Nitrate film probable burns more intensely then shown on screen. The movie has drama, humor and charm. If you love the golden age of Hollywood you will love this movie. It will be among the most talked about movies of the year and will be included on most ten best lists. See it.",9,1,3,23 November 2011
La La Land," Brave and brilliant movie making.
","Here's a modern original take on the Hollywood movie musical. You remember when the stars broke into song and or dance. It's bright colorful and a treat for the visual and audio senses.The director is going to get much of the credit for making this work. Emma Stone gives an award worthy performance as the insecure girl wanting to live her dream. Maybe she stares into the distance a bit too often.Everything about this production is outstanding. The costumes, the music even the poster is beautiful.The movie takes advantage of the big screen and should be enjoyed in a theater environment. Maybe audiences would have preferred the alternate ending that was cleverly presented. No drugs, sex or violence, just a great time at the movies.",9,9,16,13 December 2016
Super 8," ET on steroids
","It's 'Super 8' as the film size and movie title '8MM' was already taken by a trashy Nicolas Cage movie. If 'Super 8' seems vaguely familiar, you've seen it all before. Goonies meets ET with a touch of Jaws.A quiet late 70's town is rocked by a train crash. Of course the US military wants to cover something up and the local sheriff has to worry about the town and his son. There are no beaches to close but we have to evacuate the town.Don't think too much, sit back, enjoy your popcorn and take the ride. It is loud and intense. There are touches of Spielberg and stuff that was slipped in while he wasn't looking. Still it gets a super 8 out of 10. When the dogs leave town, you know the people are in trouble.",8,3,5,15 June 2011
Snowden," Loud Whistle Blower
","Edward Snowden was mad as hell and couldn't take in anymore. Actually as portrayed in the movie he seemed more nervous then angry. Good performances and plenty of Oliver Stone dialogue and direction try to give you insight into a hero or traitor or some of both. Snowden must be an only child orphan based on his characters lack of backstory.The movie suffers from the written and directed by syndrome as it is too long. It is extremely dialogue driven. There are so many walk and talks, stand and talks and even Skype and talks. The attempts at suspense don't work because they are in flashback and you know the outcomes.No need to see this in a theater as it will play well on a home platform. Don't forget if you see it in a theater you most likely are on some type of video surveillance. Watch it at home, seems like you are being watched too. I wonder if he is being watched in Russia?",7,0,4,2 October 2016
Woman in Gold," They stole art too.
","In addition to genocide, using humans for 'medical experiments' they stole anything of value including art.Perhaps the art is the only restitution as what can be done with the 10 million people killed by Nazi's for their religion, life style or anything else that didn't fit the master plan. Stealing art was probably the least of the atrocities.Mirren literally shelps this movie along on her shoulders. She gives it her best with a script that doesn't give her much. It is written like a made for TV movie. There are way to many 'walk and talks'. Most everything is conveyed through the always on the nose dialogue. When something is shown visually such as the warm flower throwing crowd of Austrians welcoming the Nazi's it has to be told again in dialogue in case it wasn't noticed.Too many things startled the audience and took them out of the film. The appearance of the only Austrian with a guilty conscience meeting for a stand and talk on the street was forced. The introduction out of nowhere of the Ronald Lauder was awkward. The who is that actress as the judge took the audience out of the movie to decide it was Elizabeth McGovern, interesting choice married to the director.There was a lack of Jewish tradition in the wedding scene. The tear jerker from her parents to remember them was never even met with a memorial candle.There are plenty of boring court scenes and dull speeches. The movie could have been much better. There is no need to see this in a theater as it will play the same on a home platform.",5,3,7,9 April 2015
Love & Mercy," Good movie. Not a good time at the movies.
",Love and Mercy is the story of Brian Wilson the creative force of the.Beach Boy music. Award worthy performances by both of the actors playing Brian Wilson and Paul Giamatti as the evil Dr. Landy. Elizabeth Banks is a ray of light among the darkness.At just over two hours the movie is and feels a bit long. There are redundant scenes of a young disturbed Wilson with Landy verbally abusing everyone in range. The movie makes it clear he overstepped boundaries.It's a well done bio-pic but it is difficult to watch. There is barely enough Beach Boy music considering their vast library. There is no need to see this in a theater as it will play well on a home platform.,7,4,6,23 June 2015
How to Train Your Dragon," No reptile dysfunction here
","This movie soars. A simple story beautifully told. Tolerance, understanding, and parental approval themes are explored with charm, humor and grace in this great adventure. The story of a Boy and his Dragon is beautifully animated, well voiced and very well made. Part of the beauty of the script is Toothless, the Dragon has no dialogue. Hiccup, the boy, looks like Conan O'Brien and Toothless the dragon looks like Stitch of Lilo and Stitch. The film makers will only have themselves to sue. The film may be too intense, and too loud in 12000 watts of Imax sound, for smaller children.This film will be remembered at Oscar time. Don't wait. See it now in 3D.",9,2,6,26 March 2010
Beauty and the Beast," Disney digs into the gold mine.
","Beauty and the Beast is back in a combination live action and animation. Add a few new songs for award consideration. Great sets and art direction all combine for an excellent movie experience.Emma Watson as Belle is convincing and her prince is best in beast mood. The supporting cast works hard and Josh Gad continues to get the buzz for his character. The old songs are comfortable the new ones fit.The movie is a tad long but once it gets going it moves along at a good pace. While it is appropriate for the entire family, there are a few intense moments that might be tough on younger children.The movie looks great on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. The 3D added.a few wrinkles but may not be worth the up-charge. This version of the tale as old as time will become a classic that will be continue to be enjoyed on home platforms.",9,11,22,21 March 2017
Jack Reacher," Reacher preacher
","Here's an old fashioned who did it and why story complete with the strong, unfortunately not silent, male lead. Seems he'd rather fight then make love.The action scenes work best even with a sub par car chase if 'Bulitt' or 'The French Connection' is considered par. The fights scenes on occasion seem borrowed from Jackie Chan. Things slow to a crawl when Cruise looks out the window and becomes philosophical. The movie suffers from the written and directed syndrome and feels about twenty minutes too long.If you overlook the flaws, it's a good time at the movies. Hold on to your popcorn and take a ride with Jack Reacher. Don't give him your car keys.",7,3,8,28 December 2012
"McFarland, USA"," Mc Formula
","Here's a feel good sports movie that goes a bit deeper. It's the story of a coach that hits bottom and takes kids from the poorest part of society to new heights.It the classic formula of the coach learning as much from his students as they learn from him. Based on a true story, the 'where they are now' shots makes for a feel good Hollywood ending.Kevin Costner carries this movie on his back. It's hard to believe the movie gets made without him. The supporting performances are serviceable even though the lead student and top runner looks way too old for high school.The movie plays well on the big screen but it won't loose too much on a home platform. The movie is suitable for and will be enjoyed by all ages.",7,1,18,25 February 2015
Les MisÃ©rables," All singing no dancing.
","'Les Miserables' is a great musical.Don't waste anymore time. Give every Best Supporting Actress Award this year to Anne Hathaway. It's not light and fluffy like Mary Poppins; it deals with an extremely dark and difficult time in human history. It's a bit long and uneven at times.If all singing is not your thing you may have trouble with this. Hugh Jackman can act and sing. Russel Crowe gives it a good shot. So what if Crowe sings in front of a bird statue, it's not a crow. Songs are spread out to the supporting cast and they all deliver.It's an extremely powerful movie that evokes emotion. If you don't want to cry don't go. If you go and don't cry you have no heart. If you want to be amazed by the power of a movie spend two and a half hours with this outstanding cinematic achievement.",10,21,41,25 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Long and loud.
",If you saw Guardians one you know what to expect and two deliveries. All of your favorite characters are back in one form or another and there is an interesting good guy bad guy who seemed to have escaped from The Blue Man Group. In case you are wondering Zoe Saldana is green.Be prepared for a complete assault on your senses. The movie is so loud it seems the Kurt Russell character decided to keep his brain in a cave to avoid the noise. In regard to the Russell character the plot spins into a shaggy God story.The few quiet moments are refreshing. The dialogue is sharp and often funny. Characters yelling at each other is not conflict. Seems like all families have issues.The movie looks great on the big screen and should be seen in a theater environment. There are plenty of things during the credits including the promise of another sequel.,7,1,3,12 May 2017
The Shape of Water," Creature from the Black Lagoon never looked so good.
","Here's movie that preaches tolerance. It's a love story between a speechless girl and an aquatic creature. Never mind where will they live.The movie looks great. Beautifully photographed exquisite sets and an outstanding use of music lift this movie above the crowd.Thinks go wrong with the movie when Michael Shannon as a way over the top villain, relentlessly starts shooting. The movie goes way off the rails when it begins to deal with God like qualities of the creature. Some scenes are unintentionally funny.The movie plays well on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. Strong performances and technical achievements will be recognized in the award season. Dive in to this unusual melding of genres.",7,26,50,8 December 2017
American Made," Tom Cruise delivers.
","Talk about a guy who got a start in Risky Business, Tom Cruise gets involved in plenty of risky business as a freelancer for the CIA and an entrepreneur.There are plenty of plane flights south of the border, maybe too many as they become repetitive. Cruise is always smiling and that seems to get him out of trouble. He gives a Golden Globe type of performance and caries this picture on his back.It is rather light hearted considering the products he was flying. If you are bringing huge amounts of drugs into the country you might as well enjoy the rewards. The bad guys look smart the DEA not so smart.It's a good time at the movies. It looks good on the big screen and should be enjoyed in a theater.",7,2,5,4 October 2017
Jersey Boys," Winner
","If you like musicals this is for you. If you have seen the play and know what to expect you will get more. Credit goes to Clint Eastwood for taking the play and adding cinematic elements to take the story to a higher level. The muted cinematography and editing are noteworthy.The cast is outstanding and on track for award consideration. Even Christopher Walken doesn't distract. The movie is a tad long, slows at points, and has some sad issues, but by the end credits you want more.If you like the music and sound of Frankie Vali and the Four Seasons you will have a good time at the movies. See it in a theater with a big screen and big sound.",10,18,29,20 June 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Too Dark Thirty
","It starts with 911 calls from 9/11 and moves right into the torture of prisoners. The first five minutes will have some running for the exits. Kathryn Bigelow, award winner for 'The Hurt Locker' directs this hard to watch movie.Jessica Chastain is an outstanding actress and will be recognized this award season. Lesser known actors give a sense of reality that is lost with the appearance of James Gandolfini.Even though going in you know what the movie is about and how that comes out, it is brutal to watch. It is an outstanding achievement in movie making and it will garner a slew of technical nominations.If you go to a movie to shut your eyes this is for you. It is too long, too dark and not a good time at the movies.",4,38,94,19 December 2012
Steve Jobs," Plenty of sharp dialogue.
","Aron Sorkin writes great dialogue. Here it is too much of a good thing. There are an abundance of walk and talks, stand around and talks, and flashbacks that are all dialogue driven scenes. The last scene, the most powerful in the movie had no dialogue. Take note.At one point even Steve Jobs says it is like five minutes before every major product unveil, everyone goes out and gets drunk so they can tell him exactly what they think of him.Excellent performances that will be considered in award season. It is written so that every supporting character has a consider me speech. The wide screen cinematography looks like it was shot on a iPhone. There was a excellent use of music.The movie didn't go into the life and death issues, perhaps there is a part two. No need to see it on the big screen, it will play well and talky on a home platform.",7,6,17,10 October 2015
Burlesque," Life is a Burlesque... new chum.
","If you like old fashioned musicals this is for you. Small town girl comes to Hollywood. In the tradition of 'Cabaret' the music is performed in the venue rather then the characters bursting into song like dialogue. Unlike 'Cabaret' the bad guys aren't Nazis, but unseen evil banks and real estate developers.The story is thin, fluff, and predictable. The only thing stiffer then the dialogue is Cher's face. The musical numbers are high octane entertainment.Christina Aguilera will be recognized by the Golden Globes for her performance and a song she wrote seems poised for an Academy Award. Stanly Tucci always looks like he is having fun.It's not 'Chicago'. It doesn't measure up to the classic Hollywood musicals but it's a good try. See it.",6,9,12,25 November 2010
Pitch Perfect 2," Not perfect but good enough.
","The Barden Bella's are back. If you liked the first Pitch Perfect you will enjoy this sequel. The entire cast is back and they are joined by some new friends and enemies.There are plenty of musical numbers on and off various stages. There are some clever cameos from the President to the star defense of the Green Bay Packers.It is almost perfect as a fluff movie. Some of the jokes fall flat but many work at some level. In addition to good music, there's outstanding product placement that is hard to ignore.Girl power is a positive message on the screen and at the director level. Some movies need a big screen, this one needs good sound. See this feel good movie in a theater or on a home platform where it is likely to become a staple.",7,2,10,21 May 2015
Whiplash," Beat the drums, beat the drummer.
","We've seen this bully before. He's the drill Sargent taunting Mayo, and the guy that says 'You can't handle the truth'. The truth here is that why doesn't the schools administration know what's happening? Even Woody Hayes got fired for slapping the punter.If you like drumming this movie is for you. Good performances. Hard to imagine buying insurance from J.K. Simmons after this role. The many reasons not to like him include the writer directors unnecessary need to lie about the cause of death of a former student. Things work for most of the movie but it becomes laughable moments after a car wreck. That changes the meaning of 'Whiplash'. The I'll show you, no I'll show you ending gets set up by a chance meeting at a bar? There are plenty of in your face scenes shot digitally with not enough light. The small budget is apparent on the screen. No need to search this out in a theater as it will play well at home very soon.",6,1,5,12 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Decadent, salacious, excessive and fun.
",Not since 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' has Scorsese been this on target. DiCaprio is outstanding as Jordan Belfort who reaches new levels of greed.The movie is long on debauchery and drug use is often repeated. Some may object to the total lack of any moral compass. The first Mrs. Balfort might have provided some grounding except she was quickly dispatched and never heard from again.The movie is funny and very entertaining. It is frightening to think about how much Balfort got away with for less then two years in a country club Federal prison. The movie is worthy of the awards it will receive. See it.,9,3,14,25 December 2013
"Hail, Caesar!"," A comedy, musical, mystery, political drama, whatever works for you.
","Actually it is an homage to the studio system days of the 1950's when sailors danced, Esther Williams did water ballets and cowboys sang.A big cast doesn't break a sweat as they stroll about this quirky offering. There are funny moments and bits. One of the best has Frances McDormand as a film editor. The musical numbers are fun. The movie is pleasant enough but the Coen brothers have a high bar and their written and directed credit sets certain expectations. If you're a fan or lived through the movies of the fifties this should work for you. If you are expecting 'Fargo'. you will be disappointed.The movie has excellent production values and looks good on the big screen. A comedy is best when it is shared with an audience. The problem here is a large portion of the audience may not find enough laughs.",7,2,10,5 February 2016
Dark Shadows," Dead on arrival...almost
","When Johnny Depp and Tim Burton work together there are high expectations. If you plan to see this, lower your expectations. The movie doesn't hit it's stride. It can't decide if it's a comedy, romance or a horror thriller and in the end it comes up short.Great costumes, interesting sets, excellent use of original and period music. The performances are intentionally stiff. There are some fun things. Johnny Depp is always interesting and even as a vampire his hanging around is fun. There are a couple of good laughs and it seems that is the direction they should have gone.The bleeding pictures and walls, and carvings coming to life didn't seem very fresh. It was disappointing that the Depp character needed out of the blue help to dispatch the evil bitch witch. It's not a bad movie, it's just not as good as you would expect from the talent involved.",6,0,1,15 May 2012
Kong: Skull Island," Big ape with a big heart.
","You know what you are getting into by the title. So if King Kong taking on nasty animals in jungle Isn't of interest stay away.The movie has a very well paced beginning. Things slow down at Skull Island and thankfully nobody decides Kong would do better ice skating in New York.The cast is serviceable and it is hard to compete with the big ape. Things pick up when John C. Reilly is on screen. The locations look good, the CGI animals are nothing special.The movie looks good on the big screen and should be seen in a theater with good sound. There is an after credit sequence that isn't worth the wait through the lengthy credits. Basically some talking sets up a possible sequel. Do we need another Kong movie?",6,0,1,11 April 2017
Inception," High Concept gone wrong.
","For an original screenplay it conjures up dreams of other movies. It starts with Ken Watananbe looking like Dustin Hoffman in 'Little Big Man'. It contains the assault on Blofeld's headquarters from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. Edith Piaf sings to remind us of Marion Cotillard's Oscar win for 'La Vie en Rose', before Cotillard turns into Norman Bates' 'Psycho' mother.Ellen Page seemed too young and mumbled her lines. Michael Caine was a distraction in a tea bag role, dipping in here and there. Hans Zimmer wrote a head pounding score that no one could sleep through. Given a ten hour flight to plant the idea in the subjects mind, it seemed like it took ten hours. The burning question of Leo getting home pales to 'are we ever getting out of the theater'. The movie suffers from the written, produced and directed by syndrome. It is way too long, way to loud and way too bad.",2,14,31,19 July 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Dogs rule.
",Here's a movie that they have been promoting for more than a year. One problem is you have seen so much of the movie in various trailers. The only character that didn't seem to make the trailers was the hawk who while looking for Max sounded like he was looking for Nemo. Another problem is the high concept of the secret life of pets but after the premise it is short on story.It's bright and frenetic. The characters are voiced perfectly with Kevin Hart having the most fun. There is plenty of animal on animal violence but animated animals tend not to get hurt. There is a shameless plug for a future animated movie with a 'Sing' sign on the bus evolved in a chase.It is a fun time at the movies and works well on the big screen. There is enough for kids and the adults who will take them. After a strong theatrical run it will play well and entertain the kids at home for a long time.,7,5,9,8 July 2016
Finding Dory," Works for the entire family.
","You'll have no trouble finding Dory, she is in every scene.Simple story road picture of Dory trying to find her fish parents. The voices are great. There are plenty of new characters. Hank the octopus is good enough to get his own movie. The only thing lacking was a new song over the end credits. Stay for the credits as there are a couple more laughs before the final end.The movie is extremely simple and may not offer enough challenge to the adults or older kids. It's beautifully animated and looks as good on the big screen where it deserves to be seen. After the theatrical run look for this to have a long life on home platforms.",8,1,9,23 June 2016
Arrival," Anthropoids should move faster.
",Here is an ambitious effort to revive and take a genre mainstream. There isn't much dialogue but it usually foreshadows things to come. The movie is not going anywhere in warp speed. It seems slow and the scenes with the aliens seem redundant. There is some gibberish rule about how often you can interact with the aliens. The why can't we all just get along message is far from subtle. There are plenty of scenes of Amy Adams contemplating the situation by staring into the landscape.The movie is ambitious and there is plenty to talk about around the water cooler. It won't be all good. Seems like the aliens could have picked a better place then Earth to arrive. You would think by now there is something more sophisticated then the Cannery in the coal mine.The movie plays well on the big screen with big sound. It plays best in a theater environment if you choose to try it.,4,0,7,15 November 2016
Rango," There's a new sheriff in town
","Rango takes you on a journey of discovery, helped along with interesting well voiced characters. On the surface it's the standard western water story with the bad guy turtle in a wheel chair.The animation is often beautiful and resembles outstanding cinematography. The score is extraordinary and worth the price of admission.It is too intense for young children, as evidenced by the number of mothers with bundles running for the exits when the snake appears. Leave the kids home. They won't get most of the jokes and it is too long.See it. It's a very good early in the year release.",7,0,2,8 March 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Great until Birdman starts molting.
","Here's a written and directed by movie that proves the adage 'too much of a good thing'. It is interesting and outstanding for over an hour. Unfortunately the movie is nearly two hours long.It's a movie about a washed up movie star that goes all in on a Broadway play. Michael Keaton gives an award worthy performance, mostly yelling at the various supporting cast members.The drum solo jazz score works until it becomes tiresome. The digital cinematography works until there are depth of field issues and a sign in the background that can't handle the pan shots. Scenes become redundant with Emma Stone on the roof and repeated tracking shots down the empty hall.You know the loaded gun is coming. But it's a stretch to believe he can fly, of course more then once.The movie works best when it isn't taking itself too seriously. It is a serious dialogue driven movie with some very funny moments. No need to see it in a theater as it will play well in the comfort of your home.",7,9,21,23 October 2014
The Big Short," Greed is good again.
",Award worthy performances from a strong cast. Even Steve Carell shows a decent range as compared with his previous efforts.A movie about the financial crisis caused by the housing bubble and those on the short side may not bring everyone into the theater. Director Adam McKay deserves the credit for giving this story life. The editing is also special.The Short may be a tad long and a bit to technical even with the humorous explanations. The movie is engrossing and while it is funny at times it is difficult to pass it off as a comedy.While the film looks good on the big screen it will play well on a home platform.,8,2,7,14 December 2015
Wonder Woman," Super super hero
",Looking for a strong female character driven movie? Look no further. Don't hate her because she is beautiful and has super powers.Here's a summer super hero movie that delivers. There is plenty of action and just enough sensitive quiet moments. Those with a heart may even shed a tear.The movie is loaded with CGI and any other available special effects. The first battle scene on the beach sets the tone. This is about good versus evil. It's a good time at the movies and should be seen in a theater. There didn't seem to be much added seeing it in 3D. There are an abundance of night and dark scenes that need all the projection light they can get. Perhaps the 3D projection system and glasses make things a tad to dark. The strong box office will insure we will see more of Wonder Woman. Besides the most evil Germans were not those in WW I.,9,41,88,7 June 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," Mostly shades of nay.
","You should know what to expect and it may not be as bad as you expected. It's in focus, has an interesting score and may not be taking itself too seriously. Dakota Johnson is excellent as Anastasia. If you close your eyes and just listen you'll hear the same voice of Melanie Griffith, her mom.Other then Anastasia all the other characters are strained and wooden. On occasions when Grey sits down to tell his story, the scenes are unintentionally laughable. There are crater size holes in the script. Anastasia has to go see her mother, the reason, never explained. Grey has a business reason he must get back, why bother to write it? There is something in his past that doesn't allow him to be touched? There's some reference to burns but that makes no sense.Basically it' the story of a young girl and her pervert stalker. Like most comedies this plays best when shared with a theater audience. The ending leaves plenty of room for a sequel.",5,1,3,18 February 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman V Superman exactly why.
","This is truly an awful movie. If you last two and a half hours plus you are rewarded by the promise of a sequel.What makes this awful starts with the director or editor, who ever had the the say on which scenes go where. So many were interchangeable, it was like they were randomly picked up off the cutting room floor and assembled. Often the parallel action didn't seem or need to be parallel. The acting verges of atrocious. Ben Affleck joins a long line of wimps playing the caped crusader. Does Henry Cavill have any expression. Amy Adams runs around lost as Lois. Jessie Eisenberg is more obnoxious then threatening. You would think he would own a more sophisticated timer. Holly Hunter is miscast. There is an often overbearing score that is another distraction.There is the usual who are these bad guys that must be dispatched. Even with guns they choose hand to hand combat with Batman. The movie is way too long and the beginning way to slow. The only economy was no 's' on versus in the title. So why exactly was Batman mad at Superman? And after plenty of trite dialogue they become friends again because they have mothers named Martha in common. Just when you thought that conflict was resolved Lex Luther unleashes the Kraken or the equivalent of the Pillsbury Doughboy.With so much Kryptonite floating around the smart money is betting on Batman. Actually the smart money belongs to those who pass on this overblown over hyped movie. Even if you see it for free, you'll never get that two and a half hours back.",1,10,23,25 March 2016
The Greatest Showman," A fun musical.
","If you like musicals this is for you. Plenty of spirited musical numbers. A few of the songs should receive consideration this award season. Hugh Jackman gives an excellent performance.The costumes are outstanding. The sets are interesting. It's a feel good movie that is suitable for the entire family.
The movie plays best in a theater with big sound. In the season of serious dramas, see this as a welcome change of pace.",Null,3,7,26 December 2017
Monsters University," Big hit, bigger miss.
","It has been 12 years since John Goodman and Billy Crystal voiced the original star characters. You would think by now Pixar could have come up with a better story. The premise is in the title, the story is non existent.Perhaps Mike doesn't see how bad this is because he is looking at it through one big eye. The 3D up charge is wasted on Mike and everyone else. The movie is long for a animated feature and it feels long and redundant with scare games, scare contests and scarcely anything happening.The good news is it isn't very scary and got a 'G' rating. The bad news is there isn't much there for the adult in the audience. It is not funny.There is a message about cheating and consequences but it gives the impression so what if you are kicked out of college. So what if there is nothing to this prequel except a big box office.",3,13,20,24 June 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Bank on it
","Emma Thompson gives an award worthy performance. Tom Hanks squints a lot as Walt Disney. Outstanding cinematography, costumes, and an original score are noteworthy. The movie cuts back and fourth effectively between the heart tugging back story and the Disney story. Young Annie Rose Buckley as Ginty lights up the screen.There is considerable more then one spoonful of sugar poured into this one and it may be a bit too sweet for some tastes. Unlike 'Mary Poppins' the movie may not be suitable for younger children. It moves at a leisurely pace and Colin Ferrell goes the way of 'Old Yeller'.It's an interesting story. It is very well made. It is a good time at the movies. See it.",8,0,5,22 December 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Go Wes young man.
","A Wes Anderson film has a look and a style. The film is beautifully photographed and many of the scenes look like a Norman Rockwell painting.A terrific cast of veteran stars don't break a sweat. The young leads are very good and easy to watch.There is an outstanding score and use of music that may be too noticeable. Speaking of noticeable, the opening and ending credits are officious and distracting.The biggest problem is the movie pushes you away rather then draws you in. The humor is on the dark side and perhaps goes over the line. It's not funny to see Snoopy the dog killed by an arrow through the neck. Stabbing a child with left handed scissors is good for a gasp not a laugh.This movie is going to have trouble finding an audience. If you are a Wes Anderson fan see it, all others pass.",6,2,9,30 May 2012
Unbroken," As a movie it's broken
","Louis Zamperini touched a lot of people in many positive ways. His effect on others is demolished or lost entirely in the choices made for the movie.The audience is tortured too long by the brutal prison camp scenes. It is a similar situation to 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'. Angelina Jolie is talented and brave beyond belief, she is no David Lean.Parts are inspiring, it is a tough to enjoy movie. If you are looking for a good time at the movies, go elsewhere. If you are looking to continue Louie's good work, there are plenty of organizations with projects in his name.",6,4,12,26 December 2014
Godzilla," Waiting for Godzilla.
","It is too long. Most of the action takes place at night and it appears dark on screen.You would think the title character would appear early in the movie, even in a pre- title sequence, not this time. The sheriff doesn't ride into town for at least forty five minutes. He dispatches the bad guys and swims off into the sunset.The people story line is well developed but are we cheering for people? No. Bring on the big guy. It is almost a cameo appearance by the King of Monsters.The movie should be seen on the big screen with big sound. It is a good time at the movies but you feel short changed Godzilla wise.",7,2,4,22 May 2014
Footloose," They dance their rated PG ... off.
","Easy to watch fluff movie. You know the whole story from the original or the trailers. Arrive late and you can miss the hard to watch car accident and the extremely sad dead child speech in church. Fun dance sequences separated by forced drama. No surprises. A tad long perhaps due to the written and directed by syndrome. Could have been improved with more dance and less conversation. Stars dance 9 act 5.It won't be a classic of the genre or a trivia game without Kevin Bacon. Well photographed in interesting locations. Enjoyable soundtrack. OK for the kids except for the violence directed toward women, and trucks. Check your mind at the door, and go enjoy the popcorn.",Null,0,3,21 October 2011
50_50," 50/50 chance you'll find cancer funny?
","Don't let the trailers fool you, it's only half a comedy. The cast is very watchable although Seth Rogen tries too hard and often too loud. His lines earned the movie the 'R' rating given mostly for language.Good use of music. A modest budget is reflected on the screen. Some of the scenes look like they were shot on a cel phone camera. One dog looked like it worked cheap. They play the 'Terms of Endearment Card', which takes you out of this movie while thinking of the emotional impact of that tear jerker.No surprises here. There is no doubt he gets the right girl. If you know it's based on a true story, you know it's well written by a cancer survivor.",Null,0,1,4 October 2011
Deadpool," An anti-super hero.
","Picture 'Ted' as a superhero. That is how Ryan Reynolds plays it. He is a wise cracking foul mouth guy in a tight suit.The opening fake credits are great. The end credits and the 'Ferris Bueller' after credit scene are worth staying for. Between the opening and end credits is a movie that can't decide on a genre. There is action, romance, comedy and science fiction. There is something for everybody but not enough for anybody. Morena Baccarin is interesting and easy to watch as the love interest.Leslie Uggams has more then a cameo as the blind side kick.There is an abundance of random violence that along with language justified the 'R' rating. The construction of the timeline works and it isn't too long before you understand where Deadpool came from.The movie looks good on the big screen and should be seen in a theater. The abundance of violence mixed with comedy may not work for everyone.",7,2,11,24 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Well dressed spy flick.
","Here's an interesting movie to watch. It doesn't draw you in but you seem to watch from a safe distance.It's a comic book spy movie that works best while training recruits and looking for the next James or Jane Bond type of spy. It works least when Samuel L Jackson is doing his Truman Capote lisp, which is most of the time. Colin Firth tries to play Liam Neeson and Michael Caine is now always Michael Caine.There is a ridiculous level of violence with plenty of severed body parts. The spy, slasher, comedy, gore, genre is an assault on the senses. The movie begins to feel long when they run around and around Jackson's compound. Some time is spent blowing up a satellite for no reason. It is OK to shoot people but never dogs.The movie plays well on the big screen with big sound. It is nothing great but it is kinda fun to observe.",7,1,7,20 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," That sums it up
","Bradley Cooper while sitting in a Tiajuana Bar says 'What the f**k am I watching'. And that sums it up.If this were a stand alone movie and there was no 'Hangover' it would be judged as an mediocre action comedy. Because 'Hangover' set the bar and 'Hangover 2' lowered the bar, this effort runs a distant third.After a few jokes and light hearted moments of killing the giraffe, and Alan's father dying which you know from the excellent trailer, things turn. It is hard to remember anything funny once the fighting cocks are introduced. The smothering of one under a pillow set the tone for the rest of the movie.The charm of the first 'Hangover' is missing. Alan adds a few moments in a forced scene with the child that was the baby in the original.If shooting people is your idea of funny you might find a laugh. There is one anti-Semitic joke attempt that just thuds. If you miss the wolf pack look for the original on a platform that comes into your home. It is amazing how good this makes the original 'Hangover' look.",4,4,8,24 May 2013
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Abs vs. Drabs
","The Abs or the Drabs... pick one Bella.The problem is there is not enough story to go the distance. To stretch things out we get repetition and back story way late. We get a graduation speech that says Bella is too young to make a career decision, but she wrestles with the forever decision.Talk to dad. Visit with mom and sit and talk. Do a lot of walk and talk. Be carried and talk. So much conversation, so quick epic battle.Robert Pattinson plays his role with all the emotion of a dead vampire. With the exception of Ashley Greene, the perky vampire, everyone is depressed. It's no fun to be human, depressing to be a wolf and sucks to be a vampire. A total eclipse of a positive movie experience.",2,19,31,9 July 2010
Minions," Lovable characters don't have enough story
","The marketing of the Minions has to be among the greatest marketing campaigns of all time. Too bad the movie doesn't live up to the hype. After a strong beginning things begin to slow and become redundant. Too many chases through the streets of London. A short movie starts to feel long.Are kids expected to appreciate England in the sixties, complete with an homage to the Beatles? The sixties score was fun. The movie just doesn't seem to have enough story for a feature. Kevin, Stuart and Bob deserved better.The twist at the end was refreshing. The credits and after credits sequences were fun. Younger children will enjoy this more then older kids or their parents.Seems like the movie will enjoy a big opening and a good run on home platforms.",5,6,12,10 July 2015
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Good things come in 3's
","The penguins take the plane and the stranded animated animals need to get home to New York. Seems logical to take a circus train? It is bright colorful and easy to watch.Good entertainment for the entire family. After sitting through too many trailers the movie seems a tad long. Some of the youngest members of the audience got antsy.Themes of friendship and loyalty are there. Well voiced by top talent. Chris Rock as Marty is in top form. The penguins are sharp and funny. The monkeys are weird. See it with the children in you life, you'll come out singing.",7,2,4,14 June 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," Coen Brothers score again.
","Here's a little gem from the Coen brothers. It is not 'Fargo' but there is some cold and ice. Oscar Isaac gives an award worthy performance. Oscars are tough, a Golden Globe is there. The supporting cast shines. Carey Mulligan is perfect. John Goodman deserves a supporting actor nomination. If they are still giving animal performance awards, there is good work from the cat.A great screenplay and excellent cinematography add to the enjoyment. A period score is woven into the story. It is an interesting good time at the movies.Don't miss this one. Although it is a small movie, see it in a theater. See it a second time from your sofa.",9,1,3,4 December 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," It's the 'Truman Show' but not a good show.
","Starts off with the usual horror clichÃ© of five young people, who will be killed off first, characters going to the cabin by the lake. The presents of Richard Jenkins in a control center lets you know something isn't right.Seems these only child orphan lambs going to the slaughter get to choose their path to demise. In a hokey series of scenes in the basement they unleash the dreaded Buckner family of Zombies. (The leader, Bill Buckner is best remembered for booting a ground ball and killing the Red Sox fans hopes and dreams.) If you know she is in it, you're waiting for Sigourney Weaver. By the time she gets there to explain it all you don't care.There's the usual change of rules that occur too late in the story. This time it's OK for the virgin to survive if she suffers enough. The audience suffers even more then the good looking cast that is given very little to say or do but run for their lives.It's contrived. You often feel the hand of the writer and you see it at the end when it's supposed to be the hand of some angry evil God. The villains are dispatched by the monsters not the young survivors. It doesn't work as a horror movie. It falls short as a comedy. It is not a thriller. It has some moments but it's not worth your time or money.",1,15,32,21 April 2012
Joy," Mostly Joyless
","Here's the great cast from the 'Silver Lining Playbook' reunited with the director but it doesn't work. Perhaps you can't get excited about a mop?The movie lacks pace. It is too long, slow and choppy. The male leads are wasted. De Niro has nothing much to do or say. Cooper is a one note cheerleader. The women are slightly better written then the male character. There is an annoying a out of TV soap opera scenes. The story is supposedly being told from the grandmother's point of view, even after she has passed on.The problem is you are expecting better and it is not much more then a made for Lifetime cable movie. No need to see it in a theater, it will be just as boring on a home platform.",4,3,8,6 January 2016
Her," Her may like it, he will suffer.
",Here's a movie set in the future where people spend more time on their devices and forgot how to interact in person. Not too far in the future.The movie looks great with outstanding set design and art direction. There's a pleasant score and a catchy original song performed by the leads.The premise works for about an hour. The movie is two hours long. It starts to feel long dull and boring. The supporting performances are note worthy. The operating system voice by Scarlett Johansson is the highlight. Joaquin Phoenix plays it softly and understated. Adjusting eyeglasses is business not acting.By the time they send in the 'I won't to share the love' girl you know things are just too weird.No reason to see this in a theater as it will play well on home platforms. See it early in the day as you might doze off.,4,10,24,5 January 2014
The Nice Guys," Tired genre.
","Mixing excessive violence with comedy rarely works. Here again the bone crushing, blood and gore just isn't funny. Well maybe it is when they toss a body over a fence and it crashes down on a wedding table. Of course there was no reason to toss the body except to get that laugh. Tossing a child through a glass window just isn't funny.Written and directed by Shane Black he gets all the credit and the blame. The movie takes place in the 70's and except for a couple of 'hey' greetings it seemed like the script has been on Shane's shelf for 40 years. A couple of glimpses questioned the 1977 setting. Jaws 2 wasn't released yet and there appeared to be some newer structure along with the 'Felix' sign. The movie projector in the house appeared to be 16mm. The reel in the projecting booth looked like 35mm. The film can being chased seemed empty especially when hosted into the air with extreme ease.There is no need to see this in the theater. It will play well and long on home platforms. If you are looking for a buddy action picture watch Black's earlier work which still hold up.",5,9,21,24 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," In case you didn't know war is hell.
","If you didn't know this is a Mel Gibson film you know soon enough. You'll know not because of an anti-Semitic rage, but the tramping over entrails scattered over the battlefield.At just under two hours and twenty minutes the movie is too long. The battle scenes are long, brutal and redundant. The hero is often lost while soldiers take their toll. The Japanese are portrayed as fierce and sneaky. The line 'they didn't make it' sums up the American attitude toward wounded prisoners.If you take a date to this movie see it in a mall. When the action moves to Okinawa tell your date to go shopping and meet you in about an hour. The level of violence is extreme.The end sequence featuring the real individuals is interesting and informative. There was one clip that looked like it was from 'This is Your Life'. If so they told the story in a half hour.Looking for a good time at the movies this isn't it.",4,6,29,23 November 2016
Me Before You," Love story like Love Story.
","You know you are not going to get a Hollywood ending and it's not because they are in England not Hollywood. A we haven't seen them before cast does a great job. The clothes and shoes are interesting.Basically it's a right to die story. So who is more selfish the afflicted person who can't live like this anymore or the people who love him and don't want to let him go. If you've seen the trailer you know where this is going. You know you are going to cry and you will.The movie stands up well against others in the you know where this is love story is going genre. The right to die issue gives this a bit more of an angle. While the movie looks good on the big screen, it will play well on a platform in the comfort of your home. Enjoy it and be sure to have the Kleenex handy.",7,2,5,7 June 2016
The Social Network," Even the chicken looks good
",Smart guys talk fast. Really smart guys talk really fast.It's a story about looking for social acceptance and finding billions of dollars along the way.'You can't make five million friends without making a few enemies' is a great tag line.See this now before the Award season rush when Aaron Sorkin gets an adapted screenplay award. David Fincher gets a Best Director nomination. Any director that makes deposition scenes interesting and engaging deserves an award.A strong cast and stealth performances don't get in the way or distract. Even Justin Timberlake could get a supporting actor nomination.This movie deserves 100% of your attention. It holds your attention and delivers two hours of entertainment and something to talk about after the lights come on.,9,1,3,6 October 2010
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Mostly blood very little honey.
","Angelina Jolie tells an unlikely love story set against the background of a war most of the world chose to ignore.The film depicts the tough and gritty aspects of war. The men and boys are shot and killed and the women raped. No one in this conflict looks good.The cast, of unknown in the US actors, does an outstanding job. The written and directed syndrome is there as it is too long. There is plenty of dialogue which result in plenty of subtitles. Ignore the politics. It's good story telling and good movie making, but if you are looking for a good time at the movies go elsewhere.",7,85,342,29 December 2011
The Great Gatsby," The Great (at least good enough) Gatsby
","Baz Luhrman knows how to throw a party. The party scenes stand out for the right reasons. The melodrama scenes stand out because they are on the stiff side. The exposure of the gun in the drawer is humorous. Baz, 'Old Sport' if they take a hydroplane ride, show it, don't just cover it in voice over. What's one more CGI effect?Interesting use of music, even if it is contemporary and wasn't written yet during the time period of the film. Great costumes, interesting sets and cars add to the fun. Good performances all around. The 'Daisy' uttered in the style of 'Rosebud' seems to sum up the intent. It doesn't come close to a masterpiece but it works as a visually feast. Not sure if the 3D is worth the up charge and loss of brightness.",7,1,2,17 May 2013
13 Hours," 13 hours just seemed longer
","Michael Bay hasn't found a subject he can't stretch to the limits. Here he takes 13 hours and makes it feel like real time in the theater.There is plenty of combat. Even the good guys have trouble determining who are the 'good guys'. The audience is left watching Tango target practice, the name given to the bad guys. One hint, if the guy is wearing a blue sweat suite he seems to be a bad guy.So much time is spent on redundant fighting. It is worth noting that the heroes of the movie were not US military. A point was made to illustrate the lack of U.S. Government involvement including the final transport plane out of Libya.You know you are watching special effects. Here the mortar shells spin toward the ground exactly as Bay spun the bombs in his overly long 'Pearl Harbor'. Michael Bay should be challenged to make make a movie with likable characters with emotional depth and a running time under two hours.The movie plays well on the big screen with big sound. An advantage of a home platform would be the ability to pause and stretch as needed. The Americans in Benghazi deserved better.",4,13,38,21 January 2016
Sully," Sully short for sullen.
",A every day guy doing his job turns into a hero. Sounds like a Frank Capra movie not a Clint Eastwood movie. You'll know it's an Eastman movie by the limited note score.Tom Hanks gives a spot on performance and makes this movie work. If you are from another planet you may not know about the 'miracle on the Hudson'. Mostly everyone else knows how this is going to come out. Basically 155 people survived the water landing or crash depending on you perspective. If you liked the water landing or plane crashes you get to see it a few times. Even the over end credits are over the actual plane in the river. There is a end of credits segment that is very effective with the actual passengers identifying their seat numbers.In spite of very few surprises because you know the story it is presented in a very watchable movie. It's looks good on the big screen and should be enjoyed in a theater environment. Head up stay up.,7,0,2,13 September 2016
The Martian," Macho Martian Man
","Matt Damon carries the load as he is left alone on Mars to survive. But that is in the trailers and ads and posters so did we need the head of NASA stepping up to a podium with a Presidential Seal telling the audience what we just saw? Perhaps the movie could have been trimmed here as it is a bit long.The effects exceed the performances and are sure to be recognized this awards season. Of course the movie requires considerable suspension of disbelief. Jessica Chastain who recently got back from space in 'Interstellar' is in orbit again. She and Sandra Bullock must have been in astronaut training school together. Sure there are elements of 'Gravity' and 'Castaway' but the Mars location gives things a fresh spin.The movie subscribed to the theory of glasses on actors make them look smarter. Great product placement for Duct Tape as it solves a lot of problems in space and hostile planets.There is plenty of interesting music including some great stuff from Abba. It's a fun time at the movies even if you see what is coming and know the ending before the first day of shooting. It looks great on the big screen, the bigger the better. The 3D was very subtle and mostly noticeable in space debris scenes. Even if you shy away from science fiction give this movie a chance. It is worth seeing.",9,2,7,9 October 2015
The Fighter," Take the punch
","He's not Rocky, he's Irish Mike Ward. Ward did his best work on HBO in three epic fights against Arturo Gatti. (Gatti's tragic death may deserve another movie.) This is the story of how Mike Ward got there.Oustanding performances all around, especially Christian Bale. Ignore the Boston accents that always come and go in New England based movies.Plenty of conflict in and out of the ring. There is some blood and lots of colorful language.Spend some quality time with a family more dysfunctional then your own. Wahlberg worked hard to look the part. Only the well directed movie is tighter then Wahlberg's abs.",7,1,2,20 December 2010
