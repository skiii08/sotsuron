The Blair Witch Project," Original But Over-Hyped
","Add another over-hyped film to the worst batch of summer movies in recent memory. I just saw this movie, and I and the three other people I was with just didn't see the big deal. OK, it's like nothing I've ever seen before - granted. It's also like nothing I ever want to see again. I work in the video production business, so believe me, I was happy to see something like that on the big screen. I wanted to like it, but I didn't.I guess if you're not expecting much, the BWP is something of an accomplishment, and I did think about the last scene for awhile after the film was over. But an hour and a half build-up for a few creepy seconds isn't worth my seven-fifty. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting buckets of blood and scary monsters. I think that's what sunk 'The Haunting' - showing too much when you don't need too. But the fact that it all hinges on seeming real, when you know it isn't, works against it. OK - all movies are fake, but good ones seem real within their own worlds. Because this film tries to make you think it's 'real fear' on screen, it somehow just seems all the more fake.The BWP has been plugged as being the 'new face of horror', or 'the scariest movie in years', etc...well, it isn't. For being  a very non-traditional Hollywood movie, it ultimately suffers from the same studio-generated buzz that plagues most of the big blockbusters.In other words, don't believe the hype.",Null,1,2,16 August 1999
The Thing," Carpenter At His Best
","Carpenter's remake is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. It's well directed, with creepy music and bleak settings giving the viewer a strong sense of the isolation these characters are feeling. It's genuinely suspenseful, with excellent special effects. Kurt Russel and Keith David are solid heroes, and the whole film moves quickly and efficiently towards a great ending. (Only the abrupt final showdown leaves something to be desired)The 'blood test' and 'crawling head' scenes are the highlights. Genuine shocks and knockout effects.I was surprised to discover that this film apparently bombed when it came out. (I was 11, and remember wanting to see it) Since good horror films are so few and far between, I can't believe people didn't respond well to it. Glad to see that now it's getting the respect it deserves.8 out of ten. One of JC's best.",8,0,1,4 November 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Best Action Movie Of All Time
","This one has it all - Knockout special effects, a non-stop parade of the best action sequences in recent memory, excellent direction, great storytelling and Arnold at his best. It's well over two hours long, but it flies by.This was the first film to cost $100 million, and it's far and away the best of any big-budget action film. You can see the price tag in every frame. 'End of Days' cost the same amount and is nowhere near as good.
I think James Cameron's direction makes all the difference. He knows how to punch up an action scene with the right camera angle and editing, and how to make every scene exciting. He is by far my favorite director, with the possible exception of Steven Spielberg.Arnold's best and the best action film of all time. A 10.",10,1,1,2 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Knockout
","The single most powerful film I have seen since 'Schindler's List'. The opening and closing scenes are technically brilliant and punch you right in the gut - the best direction & cinematography I have ever scene in a film. Everybody that I know who has scene this film has had tears in their eyes by the end.The film does lose a little steam in the middle, but not enough to make it a 'bad' film as others have said. It just pales a bit in comparison with the explosive opening and closing battles. Some quibble that Spielberg caters to people's emotions and relies on that for his film's impact. Of course he does...iliciting emotion is what makes a film powerful. It has to affect you for you to care about what's happening. Spielberg has a gift for knowing what buttons to push and, while not all of his films are perfect, its why he will some day (if not already) be regarded as the best American director of all time.The best film of 1999 and possibly the decade. It was robbed at the Oscars. A 10.",9,0,0,3 December 1999
