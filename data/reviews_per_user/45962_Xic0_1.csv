The Ring," Excellent script and finale!
","This movie has an excellent script, far better than fear.com (fear dot com). You can expect for a surprising ending and become vicious with the plot line. Take in consideration some 'hidden' details in the movie, I bet you'd like most! I've waited long for a thriller like this one!!! :)",10,0,0,14 January 2003
