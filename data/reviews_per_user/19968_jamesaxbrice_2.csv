The Ring," Scariest Film Of All Time
","As a fan of horror films I can say with confidence that The Ring is the most terrifying movie ever made. This film is based on the Japanese novel and movie, Ringu. I own both the Ring, and Ringu, and The Ring adds much to the original. After so many disappointing horror films it is good to come across such a fresh approach to what frightens us. The story of a vengeful ghost looking for retribution is just the cover  for the true horror of this film. A couple who refuse to accept nature's, or God's, will that they simply weren't meant to have a child somehow manage a pregnancy. Their offspring, a little girl named Samara, is far more than she appears. An undefined dark force channels itself through her, and infects people and animals with horrible mental images. One has the since that this force is evil itself and, in a truly Lovecraftian sense, if one were to see this evil fully it would be more than the mind could handle, which suggests how this entity kills people through Samara. The movie is eloquently and beautifully directed with gorgeous cinematography and an eerie music score by Hans Zimmer. This next comment is a spoiler, so stop reading here if you have not seen the film.   The most terrifying thing about the film is the knowledge that this darkest evil will not stop, but will infect the world.",10,0,1,24 April 2004
Van Helsing," I Wish I Had Stayed Home.
","I went to see Van Helsing thinking I would at least be partially entertained. I was wrong. I was bored out of my everlovin skull. The acting was abominable, and it was probably the best thing about the movie. I have rarely been exposed to such a toxically bad script. The 'monsters' looked like something from the movie Shrek, and I'm not exaggerating. As a matter of fact I think Mr. Hyde was played by Shrek if I'm not mistaken. The outfits worn by the Van Helsing character and the unbelievable heroine were so ridiculous that I had to consciously force myself not to roll my eyes. And the Werewolf... Lord! How do I describe the failure of the Werewolf? Computer generated monsters are NOT scary, they are fantastical. A Werewolf is a fictional extension of a psychopath. Since, In reality, people are the most frightening thing on Earth, psychopathic killers are the most frightening people. A Werewolf is basically a hyper-psychotic, bent on killing and mutilation. It is therefore essential that for a Werewolf to be frightening, or for just about any humanlike monster to be frightening, the monster must be played by an actual human. that is another reason why the monsters in this film are such a disgrace to all the classic monsters of the past. This movie leaves out the human element; an element that must be present for any movie to succeed on ANY level or genre. By the way... since when does a guy turning into a werewolf have the ability to crawl backwards up a wall like Spiderman?",1,10,21,13 May 2004
