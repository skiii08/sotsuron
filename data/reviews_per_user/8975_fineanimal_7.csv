The Blair Witch Project," The dark side of the film industry
","The Blair Witch Project is a crude, vulgar attempt to capitalize on Generation X's fascination with itself. Completely devoid of content and purpose, this is the film to watch when you have no stereotypically shallow teenagers around to swear at you and talk about getting drunk or stoned. It will fill that void for 90 minutes, while subtly creating a greater void in your appreciation of art that may haunt you for the rest of your life. Yes, this film terrified me, but not because it was a frightening horror film. It is an archetypical example of big business (in this case Artisan Entertainment) manufacturing social reality for profit. And that is truly terrifying.I can only recommend The Blair Witch Project to psychologists and others who study the manufacture of social reality (research Artisan's marketing campaign first or you'll likely find the film itself excruciatingly tedious). In this regard alone does The Blair Witch Project offer any significance. May it quickly be forgotten, and may big business and government never learn the lessons it teaches.",1,3,6,29 July 2002
Memento," Great film, but the DVD is hurting.
","Enough reasonable (and a few truly dismal) reviews of Mememto already exist on the IMDB, so I can only add my vote that Memento is a film worth seeing. Whether or not it deserves to be called one the 'greatest films of all time' is irrelevant, since that is a subjective honor anyway. It's high ranking is almost certainly due to a rapid flood of votes following its recent release (I mean, come on--Lord of the Rings ranks even higher than Casablanca, Star Wars and Citizen Kane!). The point is that, objectively speaking, Memento is a truly original, unique, and well made film, and there is some truly fascinating and thoughtful dialogue and narrative here. For that reason alone any film lover should check it out.I must add, however, that the DVD features an Independent Film Channel interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan that is one of the most visually irritating pieces I have ever seen. The interview randomly skips frames, causing subtle but silly jumps that remind me of the lousy black & white film the castaways on Gilligan's Island once made ('I'd walk out on that picture even on an airplane!'). Presumably, someone thought this was an artistic touch, but the end result is that it just looks dumb, and I had to *turn the video off on a DVD* in order to enjoy or get anything positive out of the interview! That's quite a blunder considering how worthy the film itself is.",8,1,2,31 August 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Irwin Allen reincarnated, again
","CAUTION: Many Spoilers Within.In all our human arrogance, let this film be a stern warning to us all: no matter how much money Independence Day might have made, you cannot create another blockbuster by simply using that screenplay as a template for another movie, and merely changing the bad guy from space aliens to mother nature. In The Day After Tomorrow, Roland Emmerich (Irwin Allen reincarnated, apparently) has attempted just that, and the result is more catastrophic than a 7-10 day return to the Ice Age. Or was it 7-10 hours? Or weeks? Who the hell can tell how long this tale of woe was supposed to have covered? (My woe lasted 123 minutes, your mileage may vary).The Day After Tomorrow may win an academy award for special effects. But that has to make us wonder, what is the point of that award when the special effects ARE the movie, while characterization, plot, factual accuracy, etc. represent nothing more than... well, the icing on the cake that special effects serve as in all other movies. After watching this topsy-turvy world gone mad for two hours I felt like I had watched the final attack on the Death Star for two hours, with 23 minutes of cutaways to Darth Vader trudging around the bridge thrown in sporadically for dramatic effect.Granted, the special effects are good. Very good. But when they ARE the entire film, there is no longer anything special about them. They're routine. Is there an Academy Award for Routine Effects?Yes, as a resident of Southern California who used to live in Kansas it was interesting to see Los Angeles get blown away by tornadoes. It was quite a lark to see the Exxon Valdez go off course yet again and cruise down Park Avenue. And it was amazing to see tourists taking photographs in New York City without the police or Swat teams descending upon them as potential terrorist threats. The special effects were that good, okay? OKAY???But the story sucked. The Irwin Allen formula (brief character sketches, two hours of action, then a sigh of relief when most of the character sketches survive catastrophe) may have worked for Independence Day, but it fails miserably in this film, for several reasons:* The only sympathetic characters out of a dozen or so characters were the homeless man and his dog. * There was really no story. * The brilliant nerdy girl was played by a Beverly Hills 90210 lookalike who would have been better cast as a cheerleader or a Hilton sister. * There's no time frame to the events portrayed in the film. * The science is beyond ludicrous. * The morality plays (bureacratic shortsightedness, environmental protection) were about as subtle as the morality plays in Traffic. * Product placement included Fox News, as if Fox News would ever admit that global warming exists even after an Ice Age suddenly descended upon us. * A Scottish research center manned by characters who have no Scottish accents. * An Asian woman who speaks better English than 9 out of 10 American teenagers. * As near as I could tell, the hero walked from Philadelphia to Manhattan during an Ice Age blizzard--in a day or two. * I couldn't distinguish the scientist hero from the putz President, and I still don't know if the main character was played by Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis or someone else. Worse, I don't really care. * A little kid with cancer was included in a cheap attempt to manufacture some tiny strand of concern for at least one character. * Everything in the entire Northern Hemisphere is frozen absolutely solid as a rock--except for door hinges. * The President addresses the nation on the Weather Channel. * An off-the-shelf screenplay recipe that includes 1 act of heroic self-sacrifice, ten thousand acts of human stupidity and ignorance, and a couple dozen shakes of deus ex machina.In other words, you never doubt that the main characters will survive in the end, and you don't really care who lives or dies anyway (except the homeless guy and his dog), and that spells disaster for a little thing that Hollywood used to call a 'STORY'.The only thing good about this film was the first 5-10 minutes of special effects (before they became routine and boring), and the not-so-subtle irony of watching Mexico deal with millions of illegal immigrants flooding INTO Mexico.To summarize, The Day After Tomorrow left me cold. I give it 3/10--one for the homeless guy, one for the homeless guy's dog, one for the tornadoes in Los Angeles, and one for giving Mexico a taste of its own medicine. Minus one for not allowing us to fast-forward or otherwise escape the opening trailer for some other lousy movie when you insert the DVD.",3,2,4,14 October 2004
Seabiscuit," The DVD has commercials!
","Being a fan of Seabiscuit the horse, I was very anxious to see this movie for the first time. I was even more anxious to purchase the DVD because it contained so many interesting special features. But when I purchased the DVD I found that the insert was nothing more than a blank sheet of white paper with a security device, and one of the 'Special Features' (not listed on the DVD jacket) was a 3-minute long commercial for Buick cars, pretending to be a 1930's 'documentary'. I was so offended that I immediately returned the disk for a refund, and had to make quite a scene to get it. I'm sure the filmmaker's put a lot of work into this film, but I'll never know the results because commercials have no place on a DVD--that's the reason I don't watch television or go to the theater, for Heaven's sake! Jeff Bridges is one my favorite actors, too. What a low-down dirty shame....I rate the DVD a zero, and for that reason cannot rate the film at all.",Null,0,0,16 December 2003
The Graduate," Not As Good As They Say
","I was born the year The Graduate was released, but only watched it for the first time yesterday. I had heard all the praise, the hype, and academic analysis of why The Graduate was one of the greatest films ever made. I already knew about the Robinson affair, and even about the importance of 'plastics'. So clearly this film was influential. Otherwise, how could I know so much about it without actually watching it? I also kept seeing The Graduate toward the top of the IMDb's 50 Most Popular Comedies, which kept reminding me that I must watch this film one day. Not with the same anticipation I look forward to each new Star Wars installment, but definitely with interest and high expectations.So I finally watched it, 37 years after it was released, and instantly recognized that it's not a very good film.On the positive side, the casting is excellent, and the acting superb. Dustin Hoffman's uncomfortable awkwardness at the beginning is genuinely funny, and holds your attention. And let's face it, who doesn't want to watch him be seduced by Anne Bancroft? But after a while this humor becomes nothing more than comic relief in an otherwise dreadful film that lacks a real story, and somehow manages to simultaneously trudge along like a dirge, while developing the story by introducing major changes almost instantly. For example, we watch the main character Benjamin stand, sit, lie down, stare and think about things that are never revealed to us for minutes on end, wondering when the story will ever get moving again. Then he suddenly meets a girl and decides he loves and wants to marry her after just one date. Realism clearly wasn't a goal here.Furthermore, the lead character, Benjamin, has no goals, interests, ambitions, or purpose. He's not fun, or intentionally funny. He doesn't exhibit any talent, and not much knowledge for a 'graduate'. He's a man without a personality, and when the film was over I was still trying to figure out what an older woman and her daughter could possibly have liked or loved about this character. Benjamin is a boring person.So what was the appeal of The Graduate? I suspect it was a sign of the times in 1967 that shocking audiences with a young man-older woman affair and dysfunctional families would result in strong sales and praise, much like 'All in the Family' would do for television four years later. But 'All in the Family' was really funny, and focused. Each week it made important points in a highly entertaining way, then the episode was over. The Graduate seems to make only one point: We are going to show you some social taboos you've never seen before, on the pretext of a deeper story about a young man who is disillusioned by America's growing fascination with the material world.In fact, it's really just a vehicle for showing a young man having an affair with an older married woman, in 1967. That's all it really is. And in the 21st century, that ain't nothing' new.To make matters worse, The Graduate has the most annoying soundtrack of any film I've seen. It is merely repetition of the same few Simon & Garfunkel songs. During one particularly tedious section of the film, the song 'Are You Going To Scarborough Fair' is played not once, not twice, not even three times in a row. It is played four times in a row! And this is a traditional English song about a town in England, not the WASP suburbs of California. Indeed, the lyrics throughout the film have absolutely nothing to do with the story, aside from mentioning 'Mrs. Robinson' in the title track. This is an example of great songs being thrown together to create an awful soundtrack.Director Mike Nichols won an Oscar, presumably for using some clever camera angles and transitions here and there. Yet I would think the primary job of a director is not to use innovative visual tricks, but to ensure that the finished product tells a good story in a compelling manner, keeping the audience's attention, entertaining them throughout, and leaving them with thoughts and emotions to deal with after the film has ended. When The Graduate ended, my only emotion was relief that this film was finally over.So with all due respect to a great cast, and to the warm legacy The Graduate has enjoyed, I cannot recommend watching this film unless you are mainly interested in the nostalgia. 5/10 (almost entirely for Hoffman's performance).",5,28,46,5 March 2005
A Clockwork Orange," Good story, lousy film
","A Clockwork Orange has achieved legendary status, but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. The original story by Anthony Burgess strives to make an important Orwellian statement about the perils of allowing society to override peoples' free will for the common good. But the production of this film is so irretrievably dated and incoherent that the moral is almost entirely lost in a bizarre mix of stylish ultraviolence and unrefined cheese. Take Stanley Kubrick's name off the credits and its almost a certainty that the gang at Mystery Science Theater would have had a field day with this overrated dud.Granted, the nudity, sex and violence must have been shocking in 1971, and shock can make a point. These scenes are commonplace today, however, and there lies the main reason that this film seems forever trapped in 1971: it relies entirely on shock value to make its point, yet the scenes in this film are no longer shocking. In too many ways, they are disturbingly silly.For all the talk about Kubrick's 'brilliant' ironic juxtaposition of beautiful classical music against the ugliness of violence, most of the soundtrack sounds like it was created by an escapee from the primate sanctuary who entered the sound studios of Leonard Nimoy's 'In Search Of...' and began pounding away at the Mini-Moog.Unlike Kubrick's timeless masterpiece, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange looks like it was already seriously dated by the end of the year it was released, even though the story apparently takes place well in the future. So much bad hair, pre-disco costuming and overtly sexual 'modern' art makes one think of Andy Warhol far more than George Orwell, adding a buffoonish quality to what should have been a serious story.And unless Kubrick expected that Americans would never see this film, one has to wonder why the speech almost entirely consists of slurred, sloppy British slang to the point where one requires English subtitles to get anywhere beyond the gist of what is being said in this English-speaking film.My apologies to those who love A Clockwork Orange, but it really isn't a very good film. It's sad enough when art achieves immortality through style rather than substance. But when even the cheesy style upon which a work of art's immortality is based has long since become a historical embarrassment, we have to start looking for psychological reasons why this film remains so popular.",5,3,7,29 September 2002
The Bourne Supremacy," The Bourne Disappointment
","The Bourne Supremacy suffers from too much preoccupation with being 'stylish' to be entertaining. Too many attempts to be 'cool' kept pulling me away from the story and back to reality, where I had to face the sorry fact that I was watching a bad movie.You'd think by now Hollywood would figure out that the 'shaky camera' bit is old, and that it was a dumb idea to begin with. Director Paul Greengrass explains in the features that the shaky camera was intended to evoke a 'visceral' response from the viewer. But then again he'd have to say *something* to explain how such an expensive film could look so awful. I suppose the poor lighting had some artistic purpose also. Maybe I'm just not cool enough, but I would have preferred to be able to see what was going on instead. Most silent films had better lighting than this one.The technology gimmicks in the film were embarrassing to watch: computers that instantly call up every piece of information that exists in the world (at high resolution), two or three CIA voyeurs who can identify Jason Bourne on security cameras out of 200 million Europeans passing by, the rapid-fire typing of a court stenographer in the soundtrack every time someone is sitting at a computer. Hey Greengrass: if you want 'visceral' reality, why don't you show the CIA sitting around watching the Windows hourglass on their monitors, or rebooting their computers every five minutes? The portrayal of high technology in this film wasn't interesting or entertaining at all. It was just plain silly.As near as I could tell there was a good car chase going on somewhere in the background while the camera was busy shaking and spinning around, not focusing on anything in particular. The only thing I recall about it was a motorcycle sliding rather gently beneath a car, but I'm not sure whether this had anything to do with Bourne, the story, or anything else. The editing was that bad (or was it 'visceral'?).The good news is Matt Damon and Julia Stiles' performances--especially when Stile's character fears for her life. Unfortunately, their efforts were wasted on this film due to the shaky-cam, bad lighting, and poor editing. Joan Allen's character was a Royal b*tch, so if you like that kind of thing, there you go. Otherwise, she'll probably just p*ss you off. And don't expect a whole lot of action in this film. There's a lot of *movement* due to the shaky camera, but very little action for an action film. And Damon himself has about as many action scenes as Walter Matthou did in Grumpy Old Men, unless you consider walking down the street quickly to be an action sequence.Finally, each DVD special feature ends with a brief advertisement for... the DVD you are already watching. Are the filmmaker's really that sloppy, or was this too meant to evoke some kind of 'visceral' reaction? If so, they succeeded, because I feel sick after watching this film. It is nowhere near as good as the Bourne Identity.4/10",4,2,5,19 December 2004
