Child 44," This Movie is actually about a Serial Killer
","The user 'mattrose' obviously did not see the movie 'Citizen X' and hence does not know that this 'Child 44' is a horrible remake which I overrated it at a 5.This movie may have been based upon a book, but the whole plot most of the time was very confusing and leaves one guessing at what the whole story is about until about the last 30 minutes or so. The Soviet system during the time of Stalin was a lot of back stabbing in order for one to gain favor and move up in the ranks.The real truth of this movie is that it is actually a horrid remake of the 1995 movie 'Citizen X' which was about a search for one of Russia's most prolific serial killers; Andrei Chikatilo. In April 1992 Chikatilo confessed to a total of 56 murders from 1978 to 1990 and in October 1992 was convicted and sentenced to death for 52 murders, then In February 1994 he was executed.The clues that led me to the fact that this movie was a remake, was the mention of the town of Rostov and that most of murders occurred near two railway lines which where most of the murders actually did occur! If you haven't seen 'Citizen X', I highly recommend it! It stars Donald Sutherland, Stephen Rea, Max Von Sydow, Joss Ackland, and Jeffrey DeMunn (as the killer); and all of their performances were just superb! Some dialog will make you laugh and some will bring tears to your eyes (as it did mine) so I rated this movie a 10.Enjoy",3,6,20,30 April 2015
The Hateful Eight," Total Garbage!
","I wont blather on like so many reviewers (full of themselves) generally like to do; as if all movie-goers give a flyingfuck about directors, producers, etc. etc. etc. Im required to write a minimum of 10 lines, so this is my take on this...putrid, poor excuse of a movie.I just cant see how Kurt Russell or Samuel L Jackson could ever take this script seriously as the dialog was a total load of diatribe on a path that led nowhere! A zero plot makes this just a retirement check for them?...maybe.Inglorious Basterds and Pulp Fiction were Tarantino masterpieces by comparison! I can see now why Tarantino went out bashing NYC cops at a 'Black Lives Matter' rally to gain support for this total garbage! My guess is that the 16,000 who combined for an 8.2 of a possible 10 rating worked on this movie! I gave it a +1 rating only because I could not give it less! Semper Fi.",1,172,375,26 December 2015
Interstellar," Total Boredom.........
","Hmmm....eh......ahh.....well the rules state that I have to write a minimum of 10 lines of blathering so my review will post, can you believe that? I don't mean to sound like a Judge Jenneane here but......really? Anyone with half a brain could just as easily say what they needed to in 2-1/2 lines or about 25 words or less. OK so on with my review...This about the most boring piece of 'doo-doo' I have ever had the displeasure to experience twice! Yes, I had to convince myself that it really was that bad so; yes I actually watched twice. I have a great deal of love and respect for actors Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway but this movie did nothing to further their careers! I wil not bore anyone out there further with details about acting, special effects, or directing, etc. etc. etc., as you don't spend $165 Million and not have those...In 4 words.....'I want a refund!'",9,1,4,11 December 2015
The Revenant," Over done remake!
","I haven't seen one review that mentions that this movie is a remake of 'Man in the Wilderness (1971)' which starred Richard Harris and John Huston! It is an overdone remake at that, considering that it's running time of 2h 36min is 52 minutes longer than the original movie! And don't you just love these so-called reviewers who blather on about the Producers, Directors, Actors, Cinematography and on and on...??? OK so the movie has made $14 million over it's budget of $135 million but in todays market that doesn't pay for half of the cost for advertising it! At last i'm nearing the 10 line minimum to post this thing, so I will finish this by recommending that all movie-goers watch the 'original' movie first! Semper Fi...",7,0,1,9 February 2016
Dunkirk," Over-Priced and Over-rated
","I wont bother you all with a lot of blather, about Directors, background music, graphics, etc etc... I will suffice it to say, that as most remakes go this one is simply another stinker, same as True Grit was,,,Over-priced and Over-rated!For those of you who have NOT seen the original 1958 Dunkirk version starring John Mills, then you have missed out! Granted, the explosions are not near as spectacular as in this New over-priced remake, but it simply has a more realistic 'feel' to it and better acting too! That said, find yourself a copy of the old classic version, then I dare you to tell me Im wrong!",3,1,1,30 January 2020
