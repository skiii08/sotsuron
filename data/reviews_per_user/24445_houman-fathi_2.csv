Captain Phillips," Is it really based on true story?!!
","1. First of all I should confess Tom Hanks was perfect as always, specially in the last episode. He looked like a natural born captain. 2. I liked close up recording with motion, but not for a long movies like this one. 3. Really? Is it based on true story?!! Does it mean US NAVY should participate with an aircraft carrier, chopper, two ships, and so many sniper and ... in a simple kidnapping by 4 Somalian laymen? This amount of navy were enough to capture the whole Somali! 4. The first hour of the movie was masterpiece, but after US NAVY entered it became a comic movie. I think American people can find how their taxes waste easily in army.",1,49,124,23 October 2013
