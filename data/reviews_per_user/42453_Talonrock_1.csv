Resident Evil: Afterlife," Please no more installments, this one was bad!
","I loved the series. And I own the previous 3 Resident Evils. This movie was the worse installment of the series. It was slow to start and I kept falling asleep in the first 15 minutes. Where are the zombies? You don't see the zombies until the end and they aren't zombies. They ran out of ideas and rehashed the old villains from Tremors 3 and Silent Hill. They lost the storyline in the script. The special effects were good. But the fight scenes were lacking in action and drama. They tried to make more prototypes of 'Alice' and lost the sense of the original heroine. I hope this is the last one, I won't waste anymore time or money on future installments. This series is one thing that is dead that needs to stay dead.",2,0,2,12 July 2011
