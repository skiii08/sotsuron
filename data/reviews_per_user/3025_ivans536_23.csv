It," As Entertaining & Eerie as Promised
","The movie has great characterization compared to the average horror. What it lacks in scares, it makes up for with great atmosphere and world building. The movie strolls along at a brisk pace and before you know it, you start to feel for the characters and enjoy spending the summer with them.Very quotable and eerie, IT still suffers from some logical fallacies (but which horror doesn't?) and has characters and scenes that seems out of place (a certain scene with a cop and his son comes to mind), but it is entertaining enough that by the end you don't focus on that.Liked: the cast

John Wick," Great Action, Less so the Plot
","Amazing action sequences make this a must-watch for any fan of stylish and fast paced action flicks. The great photography is paired with stylish camera work, that really shows the director has immense experience and love for the craft. Keanu Reeves shines as well, with a role that might finally typecast him.The biggest downside is the plot, or the lack thereof, and the weak dialogue and character motivation really take you out of the proceedings of the otherwise tight 101 minute flick.",7,0,0,7 September 2019
A Star Is Born," Great Chemistry
","Great film with a decent script and great chemistry between the leads. Lady Gaga pulls off a great performance, easily overshadowing Bradley Cooper. However, Cooper does great as a director, knowing how to stage scenes to deliver the punch.My biggest quibble is with the pacing, or rather the fact that the movie slows down/gets predictable. This is not due to bad direction or script, but simply because the beginning is so captivatingly good and the fact that the main song comes in about one third into the movie.Liked: -Lady Gaga's performance
-direction
-music (especially an early Cooper song)
-the chemistry between the leadsDisliked: -lacked a bit more relationship development or getting to onow Cooper's character more
-a bit too much lens glare8.5",8,0,2,20 February 2019
Akira," Overrated & Overlong
","Heard a lot about Akira prior to watching it, both about it's quality and cultural impact, and since usually I'm a mild fan of Japanese animation, I had very high expectations for this film.I was let down.Although the movie is very stylish and the story has promise at first, the movie is simply overlong and almost impossible to get through in one sitting. It has a lot of potential and has great word-of-mouth referances so it's surprising that even though it boasts a huge run time for an anime, the characterization is still paper thin, and by the end of the movie you are left thinking of what happened and more importantly, why.",6,6,12,5 February 2019
Captain Marvel," Probably the weakest Marvel outing
","At a time when the movie landscape is undoubtedly oversaturated with superhero flicks and even hardcore fams like myself are getting bored with the standard fare, studios should look to chsnge things up and make irreverent and innovative superhero movies.
This is definitely not what Marvel did here.It's a typical origin story, full of tropes, with an unlikable character at the center (Brie Larson's bad attitude aside, she isn't given anything to work with here). Part of the unlikeability comes from the power of the character, who is too strong to ever be in danger during the movie, consequently throwing any tension out the window.If you didn't see the 'plot twist' coming, you must have missed a few Guardians of the galaxy movies. But even if you did, it just doesn't work, because the relationship between Larson's character and her crew members is never built up enough for us to care when things change.Samuel L. Jackson is relegated to a comedy relief character without much depth, which is a shame since this could have been a good opportunity to learn more about the mysterious Nick Fury. The problem with the jokes is that they all try to emphasize Brie Larson's style of humor to make her seem less unlikeable, sacrificing their own comedic timing in the process.All in all, a disappointing origin story, more Dark World than Ragnarok, so this reviewer hopes the studio decides to shake things up in phase 4.",5,5,8,25 May 2019
Aquaman," Delightfully Trashy
","A fresh take on the DCEU is nestled somewhere between epic & camp. It's obvious that they were going for a more Marvel-like vibe and they almost succeed. Where they come short is the writing, as some scenes are so over the top that they are almost groan-inducing (like the one on the Italian island), but it seems like they almost embrace it. On that note, I liked how they tackle & try to explain all the illogical concepts from the comics before people can criticize them.There are some good action set pieces, however it seems like we're just going from one to the next and the scenes in between are treated like filler. The CGI is good although very comic book like at times (which I guess is on purpose).Altogether a fun romp, although a bit tiring at times.6.5",7,0,1,8 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Overrated & Superficial
","The movie leaves a lot to be desired, and is definitely not the masterpiece people are making it out to be, but an average biopic at best. Highly predictable, the actions of the characters are very expected and the characters are mostly stereotypes even to a non-fan.For a biopic about such a colorful individual, the colors are certainly very drab, as are the sets. This picks up a bit after the middle, but the bland colors reminiscent of a Marvel movie are a strange choice from Singer.The movie is incredibly rushed, obviously trying to fit everything into a viewer-friendly 2 hours, but unfortunately it sacrifices characterization & establishing relationships. Halfway through the movie I realized i still have no idea who the other members of the band are, I wasn't even sure hoe many they were (I'm not a big Queen fan), for me it was just one big mess of long hair. By the end, the characters are finally established, but you have no empathy for them and feel no connection since they get almost zero depth.
The Paul character I am still not sure who he is or where he came from, or how he influenced the protagonist so much.
Malek is adequate, although definitely not worthy of any awards since the material is simply not enough to warrant even a nomination. He never manages to make us believe he's anything other than Rami Malek playing Freddie Mercury, and the overdone prosthetics definitely don't help.The final scenes are of course very epic and moving, leaving you with a sense you watched a movie that's far superior to the one you actually just watched.6.5",6,4,8,10 February 2019
The Revenant," Light on the main Ingredient; Story
","It's actually pretty sad to see a film that has so much going for it, with incredible photography and music (reminiscent of a good Malick flick) and great performances, fall so short due to a lack of story.Much has been said about the beautiful and visceral scenes, the gripping tense moments and the great score, but all of this is not enough to warrant greatness. What the picture lacks is a complex story. The story we are presented just doesn't hold up to scrutiny, somehow managing to be unexplored and overstretched and managing to squeeze logical inconsistencies together with amazingly realistic scenes.Take the relationship between Glass and his son; you're telling me there wasn't time to explore this in 160+minutes of screen time? Except for in the hokey dream sequence scenes of the movie that have to be the weakest part and an obvious crutch. Apart from that, having the 'villain', presumably illiterate, break into a strong safe just to be followed by only 2 men is a weak writing crutch.Altogether a good movie, but I would argue IÃ±arritu's worst so far.",7,0,0,14 April 2019
Split," Competent and entertaining although not a masterpiece
","Phenomenal performance by McAvoy who disappears into all of the characters he plays, perfectly making them distinguishable even when the personality has only limited time on screen. Especially impressive is the scene where during a monologue in front of a mirror, he seamlessly goes through multiple personalities within just beats, each only lasting a line.The plot is however predictable and heavily spoiled by the trailers, sometimes even seeming to drag along to the admittedly unexpected sequel setup. Another issue is characters motivations & actions or, rather, inaction. But I guess in such a movie you are expected to suspend a lot of disbelief, like three girls not even trying to overpower one medium sized guy.Also present are some sporadic philosophical arguments about the strength of the human psyche and how trauma shapes people or even strengthens us.",7,0,0,22 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Lives up to the hype
","Upon seeing the trailer for this animated movie right after avengers: Infinity war, I was disappointed because it's obviously not a part of the MCU and the animation looked strange, unsettling and twitchy and oversaturated.However, after seeing all of the hype the movie generated after release and upon reading high praise, it was time to give it a go.
I was not disappointed, the movie really has great, game changing animation and the story is not a complete by-the-numbers superhero story.
The script is decent with some good comedy all around, appropriate both for children and adults, and sometimes it's even darker than expected.Some of the plot points, such as the uncle being the villain, were very predictable, as predictable as the character's fast death.
Another problem I had was the color palette, it's trying to hard to be 'urban' and has too much purple and other bright add-like colors, which don't really lend themselves well to a Spiderman flick.All in all, a sequel would be more than welcome, however the problem is I can't see how a sequel could top this movie and raise the stakes further, or which Spiderman villains to useA strong 8.5",9,2,5,7 February 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Disappointingly Average
","As a big Marvel & huge MCU fan, I had rather big expectations going into this one, as it was to be a culmination of 10 years and 20 movies, all of which I watched and debated vigorously (and rather obnoxiously) with friends willing and less so. Infinity war got me hyped and I even sat through the obnoxious Captain Marvel, in the meantime watching at least 5 hours of YouTube videos with predictions, trailer easter eggs, theories, etc. Then I heard the amazing hype, everyone loved it and even non-fans praised it.
However, after finally sitting down to watch it, I am sad to say I was left disappointed.Now don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. Fairly epic, adequately filmed, good action set-pieces & emotional moments, good acting, great script and an adequate story premise.
The only technical fault I have with it is the pacing, as this epic does drag quite often during the 3 hour runtime, and the opening 20minutes are especially annoyingly slow, with the odd choice of focusing on Hawkeye leaving me especially confused, as he is neither a character the audience cares for or is he very relevant in this movie.The story is also a bit thin, the whole time travel logic isn't very well thought through and the fact that everyone just appears acter disappearing for 5 years is not just disappointing but also sounds like a certain kind of horror for the survivors...But what I was missing most was emotion. It all feels rehashed, another typical superhero flick with a very predictable story and conclusion. Where infinity war's ending shocked, this leaves you feeling a resounding 'meh'. And for a movie dealing with half the population disappearing and with the send off of a few iconic characters, it's very worrying.",7,1,2,19 June 2019
Climax," Moviemaking Genius
","Another great film by Gaspar Noe, a truly remarkable auteur.This movie grips you, holds you and drags you through a tense story taking you on a real emotional journey. Equal parts horrifying thriller, a modern musical and a visual lsd trip, it's incredibly innovative and engaging, without evwn a dull moment.From the opening dance sequence (which might be the best in moviemaking history and by itself warrants a 2nd viewing) to the great acting and engaging script, the movie feels real and manages to balance humor and horror with actual emotional heft.Loved: -the claustrophobic feel of an actual lsd trip
-the incredible dance sequence
-the unexpected 'twist'
-The parallels with contemporary french society (although perhaps unintentional)",10,1,6,11 February 2019
The Favourite," Lanthimos' Best
","A movie as stylish as any of the director's features, the film is not for everyone, although it definitely ranks as the best movie by the director. With great and creative photography and framing, that somehow feels both period accurate and completely contemporary at the same time. The story is entertaining and trots along at a brisk pace, with very little filler. The acting is great as expected, much more humanistic and relaistic as opposed to the typical detached deliveries that make some of Lanthimos' films so hermetic. With strong performances from both the main cast and the side characters, it's definitely a big recommendation for any gilm lover.The biggest disappointment is that ultimately it seems to have less to say than it thinks it has, so even as the end credits roll, you're left thinking what, if anything, did you actually get out of watching it?",8,2,4,7 September 2019
Foxcatcher," Great turns in a slow clunker
","A slow, brooding tale of a real life tragedy, it doesn't seem to have the best script as the dialogue is sparse and forgettable.The photography is good although unnecessarily drab, but the pacing is infuriatingly slow, as a better editor could have cut about half an hour without losing much in terms or story or character development.In the end you do feel really strongly about the characters, however this is solely due to the marvelous performances of the 3 key players and the tragic story the script is dealing with.Liked: the story

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Worst Tarantino Yet
","As a huge QT fan that shares his love of cinema and is inspired by his life story, a movie with some of the most famous actors working in Hollywood today about a topic QT feels passionately about seemed like an instant classic waiting to happen. Unfortunately though, we are left sorely disappointed, having witnessed the weakest QT outing yet.While no one can question the production quality or the research that went into this, and while he surely does show his adoration for the period, QT seems to forget that movies should have a plot, which he only seems to remember the last 15 minutes of the film.
How many times must we see a montage of a character driving a car with great 60s music playing in the background? Or better yet, can we still have those but also have some plot sprinkled in between? And remember that rising tension that ends in ultraviolence that Tarantino is so famous for? Well we get neither here, or rather we get both, but in separate scenes, making the tension seem unnecessary and the ultraviolence undeserved.And while the characters seem like they could have been very interesting if fleshed out, do we need to have all of these characters in the movie even if none of them seem to contribute to the (admittedly nonexistent) plot in any way?
And I don't mind changing history at all, but then do we need to have all the participants of the actual event in the movie if we don't have the actual event? Do we really need to spend 20 minutes with an airhead version of Sharon Tate just so that QT can trick us by changing how the story goes?Somehow this felt both like watching an indie director struggle to stretch a short film script into a feature length movie and like a collection of QTs vignettes to a time he cares for, and not at all like the Tarantino we came to know and love.",5,18,29,29 August 2019
The Hurt Locker," Adequate War Movie
","It's more of a collection of Iraq war vignettes than a cohesive storyline, an average script with typical post-Bourne action editing (hard to follow, lots of shaky cam) populated with caricatures of typical war movie characters.No character is developed too much or diverges much from the very obvious ending they set themselves up for since the moment they are introduced.The setpieces are adequate and even tense (if occasionally overlong), but lack any real weight as the characters are severely underdeveloped",6,0,1,8 February 2019
Ex Machina," Peak SciFi
","Slow but meticulous, this movie is one of those beautiful cinema experiences where you know you are watching art unfolding, while still being entertained.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Very Innovative
","I watched this movie multiple times, and really enjoyed it when I was younger, however the rating dipped a bit as I got older.Now there is some imagery in here that is very symbolic, the script is very witty and well crafted, the story innovative & the visual effects amazing.
The story is incredibly original and even has interesting twists.However what is lacking is the deepening of the protagonist's relationship.
I feel that in order to buy into the premise this movie needs to prove that their love is soecial enough to start again even after deleting each other, but somehow it just doesn't work well enough. Now maybe the idea is that they are just flawed people in a flawed relationship, but I feel that more time could have been given to this by for instance cutting out the moronic scene of Jim Carrey as a baby, that seems only as a vehicle for him to use his non-verbal comedy chops.An 8.5",9,1,1,8 February 2019
Frank," The novelty wears off fast
","A strange movie that obviously tries to go against the grain and explore some dark topics while aiming for a dry dark comedy tone. For a while it works, as in the beginning the acting of Domhnall Gleeson keeps you entertained, and it's easy to get into the whole surreal premise.However, after spending more time with the characters and as soon as the plot slows down, the novelty wears off. The movie becomes tedious, very predictable and (FRANKly) boring, with it's attempts at comedy landing disappointingly short and characters somehow managing to be at once both obnoxious and uninteresting.Laden with predictable cuts and a boring story that tries to tackle the topic of mental disease & isolation but barely manages to scratch the surface, finally we arrive at the very hokey ending, thinking of how much better this could have been.",4,1,1,22 April 2019
Sicario," Close to Perfect
","While the cinematographic beauty or the great score are nothing we haven't learned to expect from Villeneuve, what really stands out here is the incredibly well made and tense action sequences.Villeneuve takes a story that could easily have been borrowed from a cheap action flick and makes a cinematic masterpiece out of it, a meticulously paced tense slow burner, showing us the face of the drug war more up close and personal than the photography would have you expect.",9,2,4,1 April 2020
Life," Not Bad but certainly not Good either
","Although it's far from a masterpiece, the movie is not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. However with a relatively original premise (not really comparable to Alien any more than Event Horizon is) and a great cast, it still kind of falls short.The story is interesting and the dialogue is believable, however this is where the good writing stops. Although these astronauts should be the pinnacle of humanity, they act completely illogicaly and are seemingly driven only by emotion for each other, which ultimately leads them to their demise.
The actors aren't given too much to work with, and I sense a problem with an inadequate director (considering his previous Child 44 clunker) who doesn't pull out emotional performances from the actors. The direction is otherwise serviceable with some tense moments and jump scares, although there is major problems with pacing as this movie comes off as overlong.The effects are truly great and are surely the highlight of the film, keeping you almost engaged until the final scene, with a conclusion that is predictable as soon as you see the editing in the final scene.",5,3,6,14 April 2019
Green Book," Predictable
","While the movie offers two great performances from actors undeniably in their prime, it still manages to adhere to every Oscar bait drama trope in the book.
That said, the movie admittedly is very enjoyable and well edited, but any experienced viewer should be able to accurately predict the complete plotline as soon as the first 10 minutes are over. So although this still is recommended viewing, I'd rather rewatch 'The Intouchables'.
P.s.
Undoubtedly not the best movie of the year and further proof that the Oscars just award mediocre dramas.",8,1,3,29 August 2019
Incredibles 2," Fun but a bit hollow
","Very stylish and cool, great animation and some good jokes, it's a very fun romp with familiar characters that flies by really fast. But even without thinking too much, you are left feeling there is something missing.The main problem is the characters' motivation, mostly the main villain's, which feels a bit hollow and unrealistic, and the problem is that the villain is very obvious from the beginning. The story is also not the best, specifically setting the ending on a boat doesn't make sense for a lot of reasons. Another problem is leaving some loose ends, such as the remote they get for Jack Jack or the first villain.The 'camera work' and editing however are great, as well as the photography & design, so the movie looks gorgeous & definitely invites a second viewing",8,1,1,8 February 2019
