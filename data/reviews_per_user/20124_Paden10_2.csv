Minority Report," ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!
","Spielberg and Cruise are great together. What do you get when you cross an excellent actor with an excellent director? MINORITY REPORT!!! It'll leave you guessing through out the whole movie. It Brings Action, Crime, Mystery and Adventure. I know what movie I'll buy when it comes out on DVD",10,2,4,21 September 2002
A Walk to Remember," Typical chick flick
","SPOILER!!! Typical chick flick. Most of my friends (even guys) said that this was a great movie. I was forced into watching it because of a deal. This is what the whole movie was mostly about: 'I love you.', 'I love you too.', girl dies, everyone cries, the end. The only good thing about the movie was Shane West's acting (it takes a good actor to make a stupid role sound good) As for Mandy Moore..........STICK WITH SINGING!!!!!!!!",1,4,9,5 November 2002
