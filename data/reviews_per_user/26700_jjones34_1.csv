The Blair Witch Project," This movie stunk and is better only than its sequel
","This movie had horrible acting, unlikable characters, an amorphous plot line. Ten monkeys banging on a camera could have produced a better movie. Why would I care if any of these idiots died? Shouldn't at least ONE of the characters be likable, redeemable? Shaky cameras don't impress me. Undelivered monsters and undelivered explanations don't impress me. The least they could have done was actually show SOMETHING scary. Some sustained muted form, but this movie delivered nothing but two hours of gratuitous cursing and screaming and crying. I hated it more than sideways constipation.This movie is an utter waste of time and falls way below the one star mark that any established movie house would crank out. Blairwitch was the first salvo in the 'cheap is better' wars that brought us reality television. Thank God this lack of professionalism and creativity hasn't caught on in Hollywood the way it has caught on in network TV.Two thumbs DOWN, poked in my eyes to escape this utterly crappy movie.",1,7,13,2 July 2005
