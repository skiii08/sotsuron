Mission: Impossible III," Cruisin' for a bruisin'
","Many people are calling this move mediocre or plot less, personally I disagree. The previous 2 MI movies have had thin plot lines to say the least, but the performances of the actors and the action set pieces more than made up for it. I'm happy to say that the third in the series doesn't just do the same, it goes at least 2 steps higher. The action hits you from the beginning and Cruise again proves that he can not only be the action man but he can act the ass of any of the other cast. I'm not saying that the other actors ween't good, far from it. It's just clear that this is Cruise's movie from the beginning. British actor Simon Pegg has a scene stealing role as the Q of IMF. The action was superbly directed by JJ Abrahms (Alias) and some of the cast from the TV show even appeared for a while in a party scene, that made my day.Overall, MI3 is by far the best in the series, and i believe that the franchise will continue to go from strength to strength especially if they keep the styles as varied as they have done up to now. A brilliant move from beginning to end.",9,3,6,20 May 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Follows the book 'religiously' but fails to hit the mark
","Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the book i went to see the movie expecting the worst, a big budget, soulless cash in. This, sadly is partly true.The movie begins slowly and for someone who has read the book it was obviously predictable, it followed the book religiously (no pun intended), but for people who haven't read the book its well worth a watch. However, this is where the good points end.Audrey Tautou seems bored throughout and Tom Hanks appears to be going through the motions and nothing else. Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing is impressive but is let down somewhat by the rest of the cast.The brief moments of action in the movie seem rushed and haphazard, almost cheap. The whole film seems rushed and the story moves at an incredible pace, yet somehow, it seems overlong. Overall, anyone that hasn't read the book will be carried along blissfully by the story but for the rest of us it will be a disappointment and nothing more.",6,1,2,22 May 2006
