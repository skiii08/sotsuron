The Incredible Hulk," The Real Deal...Finally!
","I really liked this incarnation of Hulk, and hope that it spawns at least one sequel. I did not dislike the Ang Lee version of Hulk, but I think it fell short of capturing the essence of the original comic book and story. This version does a much better job! I cannot think where it could be improved. From the trailers, I was not thrilled at the appearance of this version of the Hulk. Except for being too green, the Ang Lee version more closely matched my recollection of the comic. But, after this new film gets going, the visual appearance of the Hulk grew on me and I cannot find fault. In the Ang Lee version, one was too aware that one was watching a comic book. In this version, though you know its a comic book story, the characterizations and raw action lend the kind of realism that comic book movies *should* strive for. I admit bias towards the two principle actors, Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, but I really think that they delivered emotional performances that did justice to the characters and the film. Tim Roth's performance was also top notch; even as a mere mortal, his character exuded pure menace. If you're a Tim Roth fan (as I am), I don't think you'll be disappointed. In short, IMO the fledgling Marvel Studios has another solid hit. I can only hope that the in-the-works adaptation of 'Thor' stands up well against 'The Incredible Hulk' and 'Iron Man'.",10,3,8,13 June 2008
Alien vs. Predator," The bottom line...
","...is that I was thoroughly entertained. I'm a long standing fan of both franchises and could easily nit-pick this film on plot points. But why? I wanted to see Aliens fighting Predators on the big screen. I was not disappointed! I consider my $8.50 well spent and hope they make another installment in this 'new' franchise. (3.5/4 stars)Okay, IMDb says I've got to have a minimum of 10 lines in order to post this review. But, how can I alter that which is already perfect? So, here goes...The film was set in the Antarctic, but at the end the survivor(s) had no winter gear and seemed not to notice the cold. Also, for the Antarctic, you couldn't see people's breath.",8,0,0,14 August 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Much better than expected!
","The first time I saw 'Resident Evil 1' was on cable. At first I thought it was nothing but a B-grade zombie flick. But, after a couple of more viewings the story and sci-fi elements got under skin. Not to mention that I have a thing for Milla (Leeloo) Jovovich. I wound up buying the DVD, and only then did I realize that the movie was based on a video game.When I heard about 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' I knew that I would check it out. Last night I caught the midnite show at a local theatre. I found RE2 to be one of the best sequels I've ever seen. I enjoyed the way RE2 picks up right where RE1 left off. This time around there is still enough gratuitous zombie killing for all, but there was also a lot of time spent filling in the background story, further developing the main characters, and setting up what will be, for me, a 'must-see' third installment of the franchise.",10,0,1,11 September 2004
Fantastic Four," Solid fun but falls a bit short.
","I'm in my mid-fifties and a huge fan of comic book movies. I love it when Hollywood brings my favorite comic book heroes to life on the big screen using state of the art technology to convince me of their reality.F4 succeeds in the CGI and effects department. I was somewhat concerned when I learned that 'The Thing' would be done with a prosthetic suit instead of CGI, but I think it was pulled off nicely due, in no small part, to Michael Chiklis' characterization.Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richarsds was visually acceptable, but was a bit of a milquetoast compared to the character in the comic book.Jessica Alba as Sue Storm I found to be more than acceptable. Perhaps a bit too buff compared to the comic's character, I nonetheless found Alba's interpretation of Sue Storm to be exotic and endearing. If a franchise develops, I hope Alba returns as The Invisible Girl.Chris Evans may have been born to play Johnny Storm. He was perfect as the 'cocky young guy' and brings to mind Chris O'Donnell's performance as 'Robin' in the Batman franchise. Evans obviously had a lot of fun playing the character and should definitely be tapped to return if a franchise develops.Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom was respectable, and I would not balk should he return in the role. However...Where this film fell short for me was the story itself. The first part of the film did well in presenting the basic facts of how the Fantastic Four gained their abilities. And I even understand that for a 'first of the franchise' type of film that certain elements of each of the characters had to be presented in a way that remained true to the comic. Still, though, when the film reached it's grand finale battle with Dr. Doom, I found myself thinking 'Is that it?' And it was...the end of the film, and I felt let down.While I felt that all of the basics of the story had been presented and the SFX were on mark, the story fell short of creating a truly ominous villain in the character of Dr. Doom. This was not the actor's fault. The blame is squarely on the director and screenwriter. Dr. Doom was far too easy to thwart! Whenever Victor Von Doom was on the screen there was no sense of foreboding and evil. In the comics I remember Dr. Doom as a nearly omnipotent force of evil. In this film Dr. Doom is just a man with a few quirks. And he was far, far, far too easy to thwart! Without a truly ominous and evil Dr. Doom the characters of the Fantastic Four had no credible foil to play against, and thus their characterizations were diminished.Still, though certainly not a high-water mark in the genre, Fantastic Four is solid entertainment and a lot of fun. But, should the franchise continue, I think the director would be wise to first become a TRUE fan of the original comic, second watch and study every film by Sam Peckinpah, Steven Spielberg and John Frankenheimer, and third forget about ratings, the 'kiddies' and family fare, but instead make a film that tells a knuckle-whitening story as do the comics.There have been many films where it is easy to say that the SFX did not serve the story. In this film the story did not serve the SFX.5 stars out of 10 for SFX, and Jessica Alba. Add two stars for Michael Chiklis as 'The Thing'. Verdict: 7 out of 10 stars.",7,0,1,10 July 2005
