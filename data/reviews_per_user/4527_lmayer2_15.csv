Howl's Moving Castle," Miyazaki does it again
","I've always enjoyed the Japanese art-like films. They're great to watch and they certainly are captivating. Howl's Moving Castle is a rare and special film. It teaches you life lessons, it has a phenomenal storyline and very little famous people, which adds a great tone to this film. I recommend Spirited Away if you personally enjoyed this one because you're sure to enjoy Spirited Away as well. I tend to look at Japanese films as art because they're so out of the ordinary (in a good way) and that's what truly makes them one of a kind. Japanese films are masterpiece and Miyazaki's Howl's Moving Castle is no different. A great film for anyone, imaginative. An excellent addition to any movie collection.",10,2,3,20 February 2007
Spider-Man 3," It was experimental, it was put out there to be critiqued
","I think the case for most (if not all) movie trilogies/series is that there is at least one bland film in the series. For example, some may argue that Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace was the blandest in the Star Wars series. True or not, there had to be one episode in that series that really did not deliver. Spiderman 3 was merely just a break from all of hype. I am sure that Sam Raimi and the crew will bounce back. It had its share of slow points and points at which you knew they weren't out to make the best film in the series. They could've changed some roles but Topher Grace was excellent as the villain, Venom. No series can carry on to deliver a Five Star performance. They've all fallen through to the cold, articulate measure of the critics. In the Godfather, it was Godfather Part 3, as an example. You have to take a break sometime in a series, right? Especially if there's talk of another 3 movies or so coming out in the Spiderman series and I'm sure it will show in future series to come such as Shrek, Batman, Harry Potter etc. Who knows. Spiderman 3 was good though. It was experimental, it was out there and it was put on display from critiquing. It had to happen sometime.",7,0,0,14 May 2007
Apocalypse Now," A Gritty Reality
","I just feel you could really get into this movie quickly and that's what Coppola does so well and I've seen the same in Godfather and The Outsiders, just to name a few. And that's the connection right there and maybe since Coppola was the first to beat around the bush of Vietnam, this movie was harshly criticized. I do believe he could have waited and maybe he should've waited, I don't know. However, I don't think it could've gotten much if at all better if he had waited but maybe it wouldn't have gotten harshly criticized. Although, someone could've beaten him to the chase and that's when you've lost it. I do believe the reason why Apocalypse Now was so well received was because it was the first movie to give real life accounts of Vietnam. Controversy creates criticism but it also gets you out and establishes you, whether you're perceived to be bad or good. What I liked most about Apocalypse Now was the visual effects in the movie. They were just dazzling and I think they gave the movie a gritty, disturbing (in a sense)look and appeal. I especially liked the latter half of the movies scenery/effects. I think it was probably generally disliked the first couple of years it was out. I think you just need to get used to it. Maybe 1979 was too soon or maybe it was just right. As always, you be the judge.",9,0,1,1 March 2007
Batman Begins," The Knight draws nigh
","Arguably the best Batman movie to date. I mean, this has better cast. I just didn't like the cast in the originals, it was too overdone. But this Batman had to be the best out of the rest. This movie has its dark spot, its high spots, you name ti. Christian Bale delivers as the dark knight himself in this gripping movie. I can't wait till 2008 (the scheduled release to The Dark Knight) and I'll see what goods that one brings. Until now, you probably don't want to settle with anything else, more like, anything less because this is the best Batman movie yet. There's a lot of lessons to be learned and it's so great because Batman had to work to where he got. Spiderman: he got bit by a radioactive spider and Superman, well, he was born with his powers. Nothing against Superman or Spiderman but I think, if you take everything into account, Batman is no doubt the best",9,1,2,21 February 2007
Man on the Moon," Brings spirits as high as the moon
","This was a very uplifting film, I really enjoyed it. I really gets you thinking about the man and the myth, Andy Kaufman. To many he was a genius, to others, just a sad-sack innovator but we see yet another side in this film. It really gets you going because the fact is still unknown whether or not Kaufman's death was a hoax or not. Some may believe others will doubt but if he still is alive, it would be the biggest prank the world has ever seen. This truly is a rare film because it handles a lot of delicate subjects but with the utmost care and dignity. Some may think wrestling is fake, others may not and Milos Foreman handled the subject in such a way, he tried to avoid the subject with comedy but he still wanted to convey a sense of reality. That's what this film is all about contradicting is reality. There are many answers to questions unveiled but you go back and you ask yourself, 'Did he just do that?' or 'Did that just happen?'. I think everyone needs the comfort of this film because it'll definitely make you feel better. The comedy in this film reigns above all and that's what stands out, that's what the Andy Kaufman persona was all about: pure comedy, whether by pranks that were only funny to him or by warming the hearts of viewers by constant laughs.",8,0,0,28 February 2007
Million Dollar Baby," 2004's best...Eastwood's usual...A lessonful masterpiece
","There weren't many contenders for 2004's #1 film spot. People say Sideways was a close first, come on, is that really the movie you want to be watching? I mean, it spelled snobbish all the way through. But Million Dollar Baby is a heartfelt, different side of things and that's what Eastwood likes. An example is his latest, Letters from Iwo Jima. It shows the Japanese point of view in WW2. I really do think that's key. If you run out of ideas for one subject, you take another side and milk it as much as possible. Million Dollar Baby is its own special category. This movie teaches us that ultimately, winners are simply willing to do what losers aren't and that's what screams out a lot in the movie. This film has a lot of heart and pride, and it sure wasn't taken away by the acting or directing of this film. Million Dollar Baby shows the rough side of things to really get the mood going and the mood was set off perfectly. There was remorse, guilt and willingness to do anything all through this film. This film cries out to be understood. Sometimes your family will let you down and sometimes you'll let yourself down but you just roll with the punches life has to offer. There are many punches to this film and this film punched its own ticket to success.",10,3,4,27 February 2007
Big Fish," Uneccessary but well-done
","I don't really think this movie was necessary, I think it was just a spur of the moment thing. It just seemed like a generally pointless storyline but in the end, it was well compiled into a story as big as life itself. It's a classic film, don't get me wrong just not one of those memorable classics. But I hope you get what I'm saying. This movie just didn't seem necessary and they could've come up with a more complicated storyline. It didn't feel urgent and it wasn't out to stress a point but that's what you need in films like these. Sure, maybe it had a main idea or two but there were more than two ideas scattered throughout the story, which made it not stick, not stand on a basis for an important movie structures. However, I did give this movie a ten because once again it reminds us of life and that's always welcome in movies. shows, or whatever because we can all relate to it. Everyone has a life and everyone has stories to share. Sure, this is a fictitious story but it really captures the intensity and mystery of life, which reigns above all in any movie. Big Fish was so very well done but it was not urgent and it didn't fit in as well as it could and I know that's the case with a lot of movies but I think Big Fish really could've used a main, thorough, substantial idea.",10,6,9,1 March 2007
Chariots of Fire," This movie was on fire!
","It does not get any better than the Olypmics, especially the athletics part of it, which is what this movie focuses on. I've always wanted to win a gold medal at the Olympics and that is the dream of many others I'm sure. This movie is truly an inspiration, taking it at any point of view. You can look at the negative in this film but it's sure to bring success and inspiration to the viewer. It's a timeless classic and it shows us that winning is not everything and that some people are highly dedicated to other things besides paying off all of the years of blood, sweat and hard work with an Olympic gold medal win. Winning is not everything and that's what this movie is about. It's about inspiration beyond winning, beyond getting what you deserve. This movie is about doing what others ask of you. Now, I ask of you, have you seen this movie? If so, you have a feel at what I'm talking about, if not, you need to get out and see it for yourself. People need to realize there are more substantial lessons to be learned and things to be done besides winning, even if winning means the most prestigious competitive prize in this world. You may never win but you will always learn and learning is as infinite as you want it to be.",9,1,3,27 February 2007
The Bridge on the River Kwai," My #1 film of all time
","I firmly stand with Great Britain in anyway I can. I simply love England and this tells the story of Britain's sheer power, resilience and willingness to continue through harsh conditions. A classic and purely courageous is this blockbuster. Everyone will know who built the bridge and why it was built. This is a great, historical film. It appeals to all audiences. There's no swearing in it. Not to say that swearing is bad in a film but the film can appeal to all/most audiences if the film is rated a 'family-like' rating (i.e. PG,G). This film will stand the test of time and the Bridge on the River Kwai will certainly stand the test of time. I rate this film an automatic 10 and it's not to be rented, it is to be bought because it's that dang great!",10,1,2,19 February 2007
Raging Bull," Scorsese's heart and soul rolled into one film
","When you have an already top-notch director (like Martin Scorsese) who wants to put it all into one film because it may be his very last, you have a classic, which has been made with the director's heart and soul. Because of Scorsese's fatal drug addiction, he didn't expect much more and he didn't expect to get back on track. While making Raging Bull while he suffered from the addictions, he was more than on track and he was more than on top of the game. Scorsese put on a master work as he skillfully developed enough will and strength to make Raging Bull, in the top 100 here at IMDb. This is a crown jewel, which really reminds me of Scarface (mainly because of the swearing) however, this was more meaningful than Scarface. You can't have everything when you're worried about everything. Raging Bull teaches us how easily we fall into the snares we originally set up for ourselves and how easily we fall prey to our own disasters. Scorsese has put on a lot of great films over the years and I'm looking for many more to follow from his directing. Raging Bull, I would have to say, was his best film yet if you take into account all the factors. Keep in mind, Scorsese was in a different mindset. Everyone is when thy're on drugs and I'm sure he couldn't function as well as someone he wasn't on drugs but we saw perfection from Raging Bull. We see Scorsese was also determined to prove something, to overcome the insurmountable odds that were stacked against him. However, people function better when backed into the corner. Regardless, this is still a great film, whether it be Scorsese's greatest of all time or not and we can still appreciate it regardless of how it was directed and made on.",10,3,5,28 February 2007
Munich," It brings us back to the problems we've gotten away from
","This is such a clever film, in that it utilizes a lot of clever aspects (example: whenever they do the assassinations, there's always a clever way of doing them). I am very glad that Spielberg chose to direct this film and similar to Schindler's List (but of course, not even close), he takes into account the care, consideration, hardships and aspects of the Jews during very hard to cope with times. And as this does not compare to the caliber of Schindler's List, I do believe it's another brick in the wall for us to learn from and begin to understand those hardships if we're not Jews ourselves. And any film that deals with the hard times the Jews went through is stunningly powerful and emotionally resonant. Yet, ti still has that urgency and that importance that something can happen like that at any Olypmic game or at any time. Security and safety may have doubled since 1972 but that war and threat against security and safety has doubled as well. There's always new technology to be used and to be abused. But Munich, however, really captures the thoughts and the cares of the Jews, as they take their revenge and that's where the raw emotion and heartfelt theme takes its presence. That's where Spielberg takes his presence and really captivates the audience into understanding this piece because that's where you get the knowledge needed to pass this on to future generations because this problem, this threat will continue on for generations and generations.",9,4,6,29 June 2007
The Matrix," It's on a whole other playing field
","It was all the right timing for this movie. With all the Y2K hype and the millennium steadily approaching, this could not have fit in better. This is a revelation in visual effects in film. People never saw this movie or its visual effects coming because the millennium diverted it. Not to say that it was poorly advertised because thousands of people we know from the votes viewed this movie. This is what the Wachowski Brothers were waiting for and hats off to the directors out there who took advantage to the near millennium, to the near future. The videogames of this series aren't half bad as well, however, they are limited, even in a world like the Matrix. These are the films that make it, from directors who put their all into making one tremendous effort in a single film. They will be rewarded. We saw this with Quentin Tarantino and his low-budget (but definitely not low-rated) film, Pulp Fiction. Watch the other two films in the Matrix series to find out if the Wachowski Brothers capitalized or fell in their own success.",9,1,2,5 March 2007
300," A big, giant piece of visual grandeur pie!
","Visually astonishing, simply ravishing, historically captivating, rightfully mastered by Frank Miller, the main man himself.Frank Miller (Sin City) skillfully mastered this masterpiece. Honestly, ladies and gentlemen, Frank Miller was probably not out for historical accuracy, I'll tell you that much. How historically can you get from a setting that's 480 B.C.? That's pretty difficult!The visual effects really want you to be captivated and to be sucked into a 'live-action' comic book, so to speak. It is based on a graphic novel. Graphic novels are out to stun and captivate the reader, not give them a history lesson they won't soon forget. Really think about what this film is based after and maybe that's what Frank Miller was trying to portray. Just a thought, just my opinion. Think of it what you will but please, for your sake and the film's sake, try to think of what Frank Miller was trying to make and trying to accomplish here.",10,23,51,19 February 2007
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," More than 20 times viewed and it NEVER gets old
","I literally watched this movie about twenty times when I first got it, VHS , a box-set of the original three. But this one is best! It was the most exciting, it kept you on the edge of your seat and your mind the whole way through. Although, I have to say, Lucas has become very lazy in the Star Wars saga since the Phantom Menace, which was quite poor. This is vintage Lucas and this your vintage space movie. Star Wars (any of the original 3 and Episode 3) is a must see! It includes many household names. Some, though, hate Star Wars with a vengeance. Those people lack in creativity and are subject to boring, lack-luster films. All I can say is have fun because I know you won't for missing out on this 5-star, one of a kind classic. Must see, it's too great for a 10 out of 10 rating. It was way ahead of its time. It's a film of the ages and has caliber modern films dream to re-create!",10,44,65,19 February 2007
Donnie Darko," Potentially great...that is if you can understand it.
","This can be a potentially great film ,you just have to follow it really, really well. You always have to with these psychological thrillers. They can be great in the right mind-set. Emotionally self-destructive, really cynical and controversial (in some contexts). If you can't enjoy the psychological twists of this movie, you'll enjoy the general excitement and that may be even better. If you can enjoy both, than this movie is worth buying. I would say, rent it first. Don't jump into it or you'll be lost, $15, $20 wasted on a movie that you simply cannot appreciate and there's nothing worse. Like I said, to enjoy it, you really got to understand it or else, you'll think it was okay. That's the only problem.",9,2,4,22 February 2007
