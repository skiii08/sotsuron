Hereditary," 7.3!? AS A HORROR!?!?
","If this were a drama, or something other than horror...it would've been way better. I'm sorry but this might be the most overhyped film in years. It's got all the typical horror tropes: teen hates parent for some ridiculous or non existent reason, 'I'm not crazy' person that no one believes, and a few others...I just couldn't get into the film...nothing about it scared me at all. And it's demonogy facts were absurd, especially saying the demon was male demon...which has absolutely no basis in reality...
(as far as what is taught about this specific one in the context of it existing that is) the only scene that I felt uneasy with was, the car scene ...everyone knows exactly what I mean...brilliantly done. Also, the mother was a brilliant actress. And I'll give a little credit for a bizarre ending, but as I said...it just isn't there for a horror film...I'll say this...if you thought 'The Witch' was HORROR...you'll likely find this to be horror. If you found that scary...you may find this to be creepy.Is it a bad film? No, it's just not really horror...even the #1 review here says 'would've been better as a drama'",5,4,9,21 October 2019
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Meh
","I get that it's a fantasy fiction film...but people in the US didn't speak back then how we do today and they hardly even tried. They also weren't doing Kung fu or catching a knife in their teeth cutting themself free from it. The horse scene was supposed to be exciting but it just felt stupid. I guess a weeks worth of training and you're doing back flips, and jumping from horse to horse...again I know it's fiction but they couldn't even TRY to put us into that time???? Not even with the SPEECH!?!? Just way too silly for me....and I know we live in a PC era...but NOT all the 'good guys' were disgusted by slavery...Linclon BEING ONE!!'If I could save the union and not free one slave, I'd do it' - Abe Lincoln",4,0,1,30 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Anakin WHO?
","40 years worth of the story OF Anakin Slywalker ...all for nothing. He ends up having no effect on anything. For those of you who are into star wars only in the last 10 or so years...it's ANAKINS story. 'Return of the Jedi' is actually ANAKIN returning to being a Jedi again, it's not about Luke, mind blower to many people to learn. And what's it lead to? Anakin gets to say (don't see him) about 8 words, and no...they don't mean anything at all. We also know Ashoka is dead now too.. as we heard her spirit talking to Rey, so that's great (NOT!!!)Rey does her Superman thing again, oh...and now she and Kyle both can bring people to life...? You know, something the CHOSEN ONE, THE MOST POWERFUL FORCE USER OF ALL TIME tried so hard to do that it turned him to the dark side, something the Sith has been trying to learn for thousands of years...? Yeah, Rey can do that too, JUST BECAUSE. Oh and Kylie can do it too, yep. Why? BECAUSE. Don't ask questions, because that makes you a sexist. Because she's Superm- I mean, Rey DUH!!Snoke was just Palpa Clone...neat, what the story behind it? BECAUSE!Palp is her grandpa, neat what's th- BECAUSE!!!Many of these problems are due to have two directors with totally different ideas.Special effects were cool..?And for anyone who says I'm just bashing anything new, I really enjoyed TFA. And I also liked Rey having a yellow saber. Oh and Rose was basically written out, so that's a huge plus. There's always Baby Yoda!!Well, Anakin...thanks for 40+ years for nothing, Rey and her 6 months of training has got the Galaxy covered.I'm sorry SJWs, we aren't all just racist, sexist, trolls...the movie just wasn't good, simple. And special effects don't make a movie great.One thing I feel that could've saved this is if it were broken into 2 if not 3 movies to flesh many things out.",4,1,1,22 December 2019
Bird Box," NOT A RIP OFF!!
","First of all, I had a review on here which was the #1 review at the time with over 500+ likes...curious as to its removal...Less a review, and more a comment on the state of ignorance with the non-reading public.I will also say that this movie was decent, but the book blew me away! I believe this story does much much better as a novel than it does as a film. With the novel, you obviously must imagine every little detail described ...and I felt it was much more effective than when it's a picture pained for you, with a film.Also, I wanted to say, many seem confused as to if the creatures are actual physical monsters or something ...more mind based? The book makes it VERY clear that yes, there are actual flesh and blood monsters.I think the film is actually closer to a 5-6 on IMDb, however as many horror buffs know, anything above a 4.5 (sometimes even a 4) is actually not that bad for a horror film. Mainly due to the stigma of horror not being on the artistic level of say a drama. So I'm giving it a 7 to counter the jerks giving it a 4 and lower, mainly based on the fact that they believe this movie ripped of A Quiet Place.Give it a go! I do suggest everyone read the novel first though!",10,1,5,26 February 2019
A Quiet Place," I'm doing it..
","All the fans of this movie trashed 'Bird Box' as being a rip off of it...so I'll be the one to speak the truth and get down votes for it. THIS movie ripped off BIRD BOX, because Bird Box was a book LONG before this was a movie! (As was 'The Silence') ...there, I said it.As far as the film itself, I don't get t he hype...it's INCREDIBLY slow paced, and so much DOESNT make sense...going bare foot? Why would rubber shoes make more noise ...? And if so, you can't at least wear slippers? And why is the little kid walking BEHIND everyone when you know there are literally monsters waiting to eat you? There is just a lot that doesn't make much sense about this...the monsters destroyed the world and military by having extremely sensitive hearing...and NO ONE thought to use a high picture noise to hurt them?? I didn't hate the movie but I think it was way over hyped, with ridiculous actions.The birthing scene was just stupid.",5,0,2,4 February 2020
1917," I expected too much..
","I see all the 'OMG OMG 10 10' reviews and I feel most of those people got caught up in the 'one shot' aspect of the film, and not the film itself.Yes, the long cuts (because YES there are cuts...when the camera passes by a background object and when it cuts to black) are very awesome ...at first, but by the time the soldier gets a ride with another group of soldiers, all I kept thinking is 'ok...we could use with a few time jumps here...' and by the time he ends up in the water, I was squirming with a desire for the fast forward button. It's like watching a REALLY awesome 3-D movie...you love it, but sometimes you just wish more was done for the script and less for the stunning shots. I hesitate to use the word 'tiresome' but yes...So my issue ...the options for modern films on WWI are very far and few between that aren't low low budget ...(lost battalion is AMAZING and a better film imo) and we don't really seem to get any glimpses of the horror that that war truly was (disease/pain/the water/cold/gas etc etc) and I had hoped this film would highlight some of that...but instead they went with a visual treat, which is fine...just not what I'd hoped for. They TRY to show you trench life, and life in the mud, but you never at any time really feel 'what a nightmare' like Full Metal Jacket/Saving Pvt Ryan, etc etc. which again is fine. It's still a well made film, with many visually awesome shots, and some very slow moments as well. The problem is I don't believe any of these slow moments were intended to feel slow and boring.As long as you keep one thing in mind you'll be alright. This is NOT an action movie, I'd dare say it's not even a 'war' movie...it's about a movie set during a war is all. This film should've been marketed as a drama imo. And no I don't believe you have to show heads blown off or buckets of blood to make a good war film. 'Final Journey' is a GREAT example of a WWI film with maybe 2% of this films budget that shows the hell of that war without gore.Still a good film, but I don't believe this one will one day take its place among the all time Great War films..",6,9,19,21 January 2020
Life Is Beautiful," Amazing
","Too many movies made post 1980s show the Germans as nothing BUT blood thirsty animals. This film did a great job at showing a bit closer to what history tells us it was like. They weren't turning people into soap, and lamp shades and all those other ridiculous myths that have been proven to be lies, but it does show that they were still cruel to select populations of people.Aside from the historical aspect which is very important ...this film is so great! It's heart warming, and depressing, it's funny, and deadly serious...and it pulled off all of these aspects brilliantly!!!The father was just such a good actor, and I loved how he made it into a game to shelter his little boy ...which you could really believe would happen, that's something a lot of us would likely think of as almost all options for anything else would be off the table, and the average German guards wouldn't likely speak Italian, I loved this film because it didn't try to show anyone people as evil monsters...but rather showed us the evil of WAR.Maybe I'm over thinking it, I just thought it was brilliant how the story focused on a son and father during a war. That's it, simple but so amazingly done. The final scenes are heart breaking, but you're also left with a sense of hope...a father gave everything and endured the ultimate sacrifice so that his sons childhood would remain (to an extent anyhow) innocent.My only issue which isn't much of one, is I felt the mother wasn't a strong character and so the beginning 20 minutes did drag a bit.Btw, the scene where they go into the garden, and then come out with their boy???? BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!! I respect that creativity on a whole new level, where 9.9/10 movies would just throw in some sex scene, the way this film conveyed the message was brilliant, and sweet, and just awesome.Even if you don't like movies where you'll need to read subtitles (for English speakers), because I usually don't ...it's so worth it.",9,1,2,1 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," A history buffs POV
","Good movie, it was funny, it was sad, it also did a good job ...for the MOST part to be historically accurate - 10-11 year olds were not asked to fight in the 'Battle of Berlin', age 14 and up yes, but not little kids.The Hitler Youth was also not done right at all, they were basically the Boy Scouts of Germany, not taught to be desensitized to war -Germany was actually one of the most civilized nations on Earth (historians still question how this all was able to happen in at that time, a VERY sophisticated Liberal nation), and while the Nazi party was pretty radical, the typical German/German boy was just like anyone else.That's a minor gripe though because I get that this was a comedy, and they did an excellent job showing the humanity even among those like the Captain. (when he covers for Elsa)I was very surprised to see overall how accurate the uniforms were, and how at the end they showed the elderly being shown how to defend the city, as this happened. They also showed a brief sense of the brutality of the Soviets - who raped an estimated 2.5 million German women, and murdered millions of people after the war had ended. I'm fully aware Germany did horrible things on the Eastern front, but this film is specifically about Germans.The Gestapo was done, while for comic effect - well. Even the German military and to an extent even the SS feared them. No, they didn't have to 'Heil Hitler' like that, lol it was done for comedic effect.The acting was AMAZING, was never a fan of Scarlett but she was great. Elsa, and JoJo were both awesome as well. Though some accents were very off, such as JoJos adorable friend having an English accent lol. Oh, and Rebel Wilson can be funny! WHO KNEW!!! But I felt the H.Y Captain stole the show!!!I may seem like I came at this from the wrong POV. But I actually found it to be really great!",7,1,3,6 February 2020
