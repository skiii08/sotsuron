Casablanca," Almost the Perfect Film
","Any film with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman would be worthwhile watching.  However this film keeps one's attention from the beginning and doesn't let go until the end.  The writing was excellent.  The acting also the same.  The story line is a classic.  This is the nearest to perfect a film has ever become.  Godfather is close also, but Casablanca is the best!!!",10,3,3,18 October 2002
Driven," You know you are watching a bad movie when Sly Stallone stands out.
","I like motor racing movies.  Generally they are entertaining with some excitement mixed in.  This movie, however, is terrible.  I rated it a three only because the special effects (crashes) were interesting.  You know you are watching a bad movie when Sylvester Stallone gives the best performance of the bunch. Nothing makes much sense about this movie.  It would have helped to develop Burt Reynold's character a little more.  He seemed to be the one with the most appeal.  But no way were we going to find out about him and why he was such a hard ass.  No, we had to make sure that the blond puffy lips got more screen time than the actual racing.",3,1,2,6 December 2002
Blow," Johnny Depp.... Was that your stomach or a bag of oranges in your shirt???
","I was hoping this would be an interesting movie in spite of the appearance of Penelope Cruz.  However, it falls on its face for the most part.  I like Johnny Depp.  I think he has talent and acting skills.  This film did not allow him the opportunity to showcase his ability.  The best thing about the film is Ray Liotta.  Excellent actor who did the best with what he had.  By the way.... what to heck was that in Johnny Depp's shirt in that last prison scene.  It was hard for me to tell if it was George Jung as an old person or one who was dressed in drag....",5,2,3,3 February 2003
