The Blair Witch Project," 1999. The year of Elly Kedward
","1999 will be remembered forever as the day when The Blair Witch Project entered movie theatres around the world and made hollywood cuddle in shame. Blair witch has now past the $108,000,000 mark. IT just goes to show, like many have said already, that you don't need special effects to entice audience members. Of course, it could've been better. Not to mention the fact of, why they didn't show most of the news report footages in the begining and the Maryland anthropology center documenting the discovery of the missing film. Otherwise it quite an unusual, original, and creppy movie. Finally another film that's now dubbed the horror film of the 90's. George Romeo did it with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. John Carpenter had HOLLOWEEN. Now Myrick and Sanchaze(spelling?) has THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT! Great job. Please, however, no sequels! Then again, would a sequel be such a badideal? ***1/2 from ****",Null,1,2,21 August 1999
