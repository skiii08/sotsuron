Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Somewhat disappointing
","The 4th POC outing while amusing in some spots is overall disappointing. The movie delivers some good action scenes but the plot and storyline seem to just be made up as they go along. Johnny Depp seems to be running out of steam , I mean how many times can he prance around and do the camp shtick when he has worked the best out of it already. We also have Geoffrey Rush at his ugly worst - I don't know why they kept Barbossa around since he wasn't much of a foil for Jack except in POC1 - he is more of a clown now in this movie and Rush's acting is well below his talent level. Ian McShane as Blackbeard also doesn't add much more other then to chew up the screen with his overacting. The chemistry between Depp and Penelope Cruz is non-existent and forced. At least with Keira Knightley it was much more wicked and fun ,with Cruz it's just going through the motions and getting paid. I read another review that Orlando Bloom and Knightley weren't missed at all. Maybe so but their chemistry was far better with Depp then Cruz,McShane and Rush are in this POC movie. The climatic fight at the fountain of youth is such a copout and also part of it with the Spanish Capt disbelieving it all and walking away after all that - makes no sense , nor does Jack and Gibbs walking away with a bag of ships in bottles with no clue as to how to get them out and of course that most likely is the setup for the inevitable sequel ,along with the fact that he left Blackbeards daughter on the same deserted desert island that he was left on with Knightley setting up her return as well , she has a voodoo doll of Jack that her father made so I'm sure that will figure into it as well. 7/10 - And that's being nice . This franchise may not be running out of steam financially as long as Depp is involved since he is the only reason people are going to see the movies however plot and story wise , they are really reaching - how many times can Jack go after mystical things and prance around - evidently at least 2 more movies ???",7,0,1,28 May 2011
Alien 3," A very disappointing sequel . terrible
","I did not see this at the movies during it's run as I had heard it was awful and to not bother by some friends. I saw it years later on DVD. And they were right. Of course different director and crew and they ruined the story. A basic slap in the face after Aliens. from roller coaster to stopped at the gates. Bumping off Hicks, Newt and for the most part Bishop just to have Ripley deal with things by herself was such a copout and i cant even go into plot holes. The dull grainy setting of a prison planet and having Weaver shave her head just brings this movie even further down. There are no genuine scares , it basically is like a version of The Thing with boring scenes of dialog and bad acting. They really needed to toss the script in the garbage and start over. They didn't need to bump off Hicks or Newt. Total waste of their characters. Of course Carrie Henn was too old but another young actress could have played her. Lousy as was Alien Resurrection. If they do another sequel they need a better story and director. Weaver said shed do it if they would do a good script. Otherwise , after that mess Prometheus they need to leave the franchise alone for awhile until someone who knows what they are doing can make a good movie",2,0,2,20 July 2014
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A fun movie with a clever ending
","I missed seeing the first Sherlock Holmes so will have to eventually go an rent it but if it's anything like this one -it must be very good too. This movie takes off and never stops and Robert Downey Jr seems to be enjoying himself as is Jude Law. They really do work well off each other. The movie itself is about Holmes and his arch nemesis the brilliant Dr Moriarty trying to outwit each other and ultimately kill the other. It takes so many twists and turns and things move so fast that you really need to hold on and enjoy the ride. The only negatives I can see are some lulls in scenes between the action where the writers didn't seem to know what to do and the actors seem to be ad libbing like the scene where Holmes is asking Watson if he is happy about his life to this point ,he asks Watson if he is happy being married and settling down -a nod to the fact that Holmes is unmarried and enjoys the chase and wonders if Watson is truly happy or if he will miss the chase being Holmes sidekick. They both hesitate in this particular scene when delivering their lines as if wondering should they say what's written or make something up and the scene is left somewhat unresolved with Watson never really giving Holmes a straight answer . Other than that the action is simply top notch and fun. The ending is also very clever and worth hearty applause. I enjoyed it thoroughly and there is a hint of a sequel at the end too. Enjoy and I will see you at the movies.",8,0,0,8 January 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," The RE franchise is running out of steam
","I didn't see this in 3d but it wouldn't have mattered. The plot,action.characters are nothing new , most of the movie is spent with Milla hamming it up for the camera and slow motion bullet time like scenes. Done yrs ago in the Matrix when it was cool, its lame now and just adds to the boredom. A few nice additions of RE4 and RE5 monsters were interesting but they cant save this jumbled mess of a movie. Having Alice and a group of survivors trying to get to what looks like an oil tanker is an interesting premise however the writers/director don't flesh it out and it becomes one tired clich√© after another , characters getting grabbed off screen - no gore which is what I like to watch in survival horror movies - a boss monster which is never explained ,in RE5 the executioner was not a 10 ft tall monster but rather a large hooded infected human that was genetically altered by the T-virus I think. Anyway , the ending is another shameless setup for a sequel. Lets hope they wrap it up in the 5th movie as its becoming more of a direct to DVD type franchise. The video games are getting tired too , if they make another one they need to wrap up the storyline. See you at the movies.",6,2,10,18 September 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Very entertaining. Lots of action and eye candy.
","I saw this movie in oklahoma during memorial day weekend and it was a decent crowd. For the most part , the audience seemed to enjoy the movie. I liked the action scenes - very quick paced and entertaining. I don't understand all the negativity ,especially in blogs and message boards for POP. I thought it was well acted for a tongue in cheek type movie. I mean , you don't go to movies like this looking for Shakespeare, and quite frankly Shakespeare is boring. Too many people who haven't even seen it are trashing it as a flop based on box office receipts which aren't doing bad at all, last time I checked it was over 120 million(this includes domestic and worldwide). Too many movies get bad mouthed simply for box office receipts when most times they do well overseas. The US is not the only market people. And the stupid comments that this movie is racist or bigoted are unwarranted about why aren't the actors of the race they are playing. Do any of you not understand the word acting ? it's called playing a part .And how may people of persian descent are decent actors. Geeze. I mean it looked good to me, why do people analyze , for any movie like this , you must suspend any link to reality - if you don't your foolish. It's fiction treat it as such. Jake is great too so all you naysayers shutup. Go see it , its a good movie. All the jumping like to video game is cool too. 10/10",10,8,16,8 June 2010
Ted," Pure McFarland Hilarious genius
","You couldn't ask for anything funnier from the mind of Seth McFarland. The one liners, gags, physical humor and I'm sure some stuff had to be ad-libbed is f'in comedy genius with Ted stealing every scene he is in thanks to outstanding special effects and McFarlands comedic genius. A little boy wishes for his teddy bear to be real and it happens and from there the movie gets funnier and funnier with Wahlberg the boy grownup who has Kunis(Meg) of family guy as his girlfriend , look for other family guy voice over actors like Patrick Warburton and the guy who does the blonde swedes voices. Best scenes are all over especially when Ted and John are afraid of thunder as grownups. This movie is rated R for a reason ,with lots of the F bomb and p**** jokes ,this is not a kids movie and I mean it ,you really have to be old enough to get all the pop culture gags and references and of course the language and some violence while comedic is strong especially a scene of Ted getting his ear ripped off ,ok he's a teddy bear but he's a living thing. Enjoy , 10/10",10,2,13,30 June 2012
Batman Returns," Terrible and even more cartoonish than the first
","A sequel that I did not expect nor like. I figured why not see if they can at least try and make something better. But nope , it still plays like a cartoon. Danny Devito has got to be the worst actor to play a villain in a Batman movie with Schwarznegger a close second. Not that he just overacts but there is nothing menacing or interesting about his Penguin character - in the comic books he is not a mutant like he is portrayed here ,here he is more a caricature. Catwoman is also another boring character and Michelle Pfeiffer is sorely miscast with her cheesecake look at me acting. Once again Keaton returns as Batman(good lord ?? you mean no other taller decent actors would step up ?) I'm sorry but I cannot watch a short shi* play Batman. Lousy movie yet again",1,1,17,11 August 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Ambitious but kind of falls flat
","I've never read the comic book or watched the nick cartoons of Tin Tin so I went into this movie without any type of expectations which is good. Most animated films that have so much money tossed into them with big name directors and voice over actors tend to get so busy and overblown that you forget what the heck it is you're watching. With Tin Tin, it is a mixture of Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean -a lot of action with some humor thrown in. The movie does give you lots of eye candy but the characters do seem to babble on especially Captain Haddock who comes across as an alcoholic schizophrenic - the movie may be nickelodeon backed but it's really hardly something for kids with all these references to alcoholism,mental breakdowns and violence. It wasn't rated PG with cutesy in mind. The plot revolving around a sunken treasure ship and those who will do anything to get it has some fun but in the end it falls flat due to too much going on and not enough fleshing out of the characters. For those like me who knew nothing of the stories beforehand that helps instead of filling up the screen with car chases and unbelievable escapes - entertaining but doesn't tell a good enough story. 7/10.",7,1,2,8 January 2012
The Devil Wears Prada," It's all about Meryl Streep - ZZZ
","Another Meryl Streep vehicle. Talented actress - sometimes, in this movie NO!.Overacting ,hammy just plain ZZZ material. The main thing is it's all about Meryl playing a bitch which from what most people have reported saying about her is true to real life. She supposedly accepted an award with a smug look on her face that it was about time they announced her as the winner as she figured she'd already won before the winner was announced. Maybe she was joking but her speech indicated she possibly wasn't. In this movie she plays Miranda the editor in chief of Runway magazine (a takeoff of real life Vogue EIC Anna Wintour). Mean, nasty and ugly she tortures her staff most of whom are just about as nasty as she is since they work for her it rubs off. We have once nice girl who gets dragged into the nastiness but finally finds herself and gets out to pursue something more meaningful. The whole movie though is about Meryl playing the bitch and very irritatingly at that. I mean warranted I'm sure Wintour was a bitch too but Streep stretches it to a new low. 1/10",1,9,13,9 December 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America is a decent movie but lacks any real punch.
","After watching lots of comic book adaptations movies. I have come to the conclusion that some do not translate as well as others to the big screen. Captain America is one that to me is in need of some punch for the big screen. This movie does deliver some nice action scenes but those are few and far between - a lot of the in between fodder with his origin and back story do get bogged down with some cheesy dialog and scenes of the old USO type shows with beautiful but boring girls glamorizing the war and using Caps image for propaganda. Main thing is , of all the Marvel heroes that have been made into movie roles , Captain America IMO is one that may be a tough sell for a sequel. I mean he has been around a long time in comics but do people really follow him ,not until he was supposedly killed off in a recent storyline did people take notice with even some news stations like CNN doing a whole story on a fictional characters' death. Like with Superman when they killed him off and then of course the character ends up not being dead and brought back which is done quite a lot in the fictional comic book world ,usually to bolster falling sales of the comic book which is what happened for both Superman and Cap when the writers had them both bumped off albeit temporarily. So now people are interested in Cap again but for how long , is he as exciting as some of the other characters. In the comics , I say hell yes but on screen that's iffy . They need to really go no holes barred with him , I mean he has lots of great enemies and co heroes to work with and so much material for stories. If they do it right , Captain America could be a serious blockbuster franchise like Spiderman but if they do it cheesy with a bad director and tepid writing you can kiss it goodbye. See you at the Avengers movie in 2012",7,0,10,28 July 2011
The Matrix Revolutions," Reloaded Pt2 or How I Made A Bad Sequel.
","After having watched this mess ,I can only come to one conclusion.Really Bad.The first Matrix was original and had all the wonder and action you love. Matrix Reloaded had some amazing special effects and lots of action ,maybe a bit too busy but it still worked. This movie had none of the wonder or amazement, most of the action was minimal and the dialog wooden. The climatic fights that were over-hyped during production as exciting and action packed were total borefests ,NEO VS SMITH was the most lame fight in the movie- all they did was fly around and spout bad dialog ,the battle involving humans and machines in Zion was nothing more than repetitive shots of the same man in a robot exoskeleton firing machine guns at the same snakelike machines with people on the ground firing the same rockets over and over- can you say Snorefest.My take on the whole overblown mess of Matrix Revolutions, since the action picks up exactly at the point where Reloaded left off,it looks more like a continuation of the second movie than the beginning of a third. If you've ever watched Star Wars,Lord Of The Rings or even Harry Potter, none of those films ever shot a sequel that takes place the very second where the previous movie left off. I think they got greedy,wanted to get this series wrapped up,take a vacation and spend our money before we realized we'd be shortchanged a real movie.This movie should be put in the fireplace and someone else take the reins and make a decent sequel. The ending of Revolutions leaves the door open for one so why not. See you at the movies",1,1,2,27 September 2006
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Hopefully Part 2 will be better
","I saw Pt1 at a special midnight showing this past Thursday. the theater was packed and we all got a good laugh out of the movie trailer for cowboys and aliens . Then Pt 1 started ,,,amusing with the multiple harry potters scene and the chase through the sky. Then the downfall , a tremendous amt of time spent on long boring sequences of the protagonists hiding in a tent in various remote locations. I wanted to go to sleep half the time . A shame that so much time was wasted on here say situations that made the audience around me start yawning with boredom. i mean it had some humorous and heart rending situations as well as some very dark disturbing ones which made this a movie IMO not suited for kids under 14 but it strayed into the this movie is getting long in the tooth and boring area. let's hope the 2nd part picks up the pace and is better,",6,1,4,21 November 2010
Salt," Disjointed mess
","I went into this thinking Angelina Jolie looks hot and it will be exciting. Instead it's an overblown mess with jerky camera angles and a plot so convoluted that you could drive a car through the plot holes. Ms Jolie plays a spy for the CIA who turns out to be a Russian sleeper cell spy as well. So she runs and runs and runs and sports a black wig and expensive sunglasses like a character from the Matrix. And they do what I always hate in movies , they zoom in during the fight scenes which makes it all blurry and jerky ,what's the point.By the end of the movie I was so put out especially with the shameless setup for a sequel, Jolie running off into the woods,fade to black.I left the movie theater thinking I'll bet critics like that windbag Ebert will like this movie yet trash another movie that is way better. 3/10 and that's generous.",3,168,289,24 July 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Slow moving boring movie with some porn thrown in
","I've never read the books or knew about the Swedish movie versions so I had no idea what this movie was about only that Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer were in it. It moved very slowly and was quite boring as it fleshed out the characters .One particularly nasty scene of anal rape left me thinking what else can they do and before long the rapist himself gets stripped naked ,violated anally, painfully tattooed and beaten. OK now I get it ,this movie is dark violent and masochistic. One particularly unbalanced violent girl and a man who is hired to find out about a missing girl from 40 yrs ago come together and we have some unpleasant sex and violence along the way. Most of this movie is quite boring and quite frankly a waste of time. It takes a good hour or so before the 2 main protagonists even meet and by then I was yawning. The actress who plays Lisbeth I will say is amazing -for a really dark disturbing character she nails it even if the movie itself is crappy. She is smart and doesn't take crap from anyone ,a shame her character is not given much to do for the second half of the movie. I did not like the ending either ,it is abrupt and leaves you wondering about that 9 bucks you gave away to the theater cashier. I hope Rooney Mara gets nominated for something as she is the only thing good about this movie in a really underwritten role. Her performance is a 9/10 while the movie itself is a 2/10 .",5,7,14,9 January 2012
Ratatouille," Charming movie and Remy is adorable.
","My only regret is that I let this movie slip by without seeing it on the big screen. It's not even playing in those cheap theaters that charge a buck after the movie has been out for a while. I picked up the DVD and watched it 3 times. Remy is adorable and I fell in love with him ,his facial expressions and body language are so sweet, you care what happens to him,there is one scene where he is trapped in a jar and Linguini is going to drop him in the water,you can see the fear in his eyes and how vulnerable he is,it pulls at your heart and you want to just rescue him and take him into your arms. Once the kitchen show gets going though it really rocks.. Linguini is hilarious and Colette a wonderful tough lady chef who falls in love with Linguini. Hijinks in the kitchen as both Remy and Linguini pull off the most hilarious illusion of cooking with Remy pulling his hair to make him do things and Linguini's incredible Jim Caerryesque slapstick bodygags. The supporting cast is equally marvelous with various big stars doing voiceovers like Brian Dennehy ,Peter O'Toole and others adding to it's charm. I'm usually OK with most animated Disney movies that have come out lately but this one really moved me and I'm a 42 y/o man. It was very adult in nature since it appealed more to the older crowd then just kids. I do hope they do a sequel as I would most like to see what happens to Remy next. Bravo Brad Bird and the cast and crew . 10 out of 10",10,8,11,17 January 2008
Aliens," Aliens should have been the only sequel,The other sequels were terrible and unnecessary .
","After watching this back in the 80's , I was thinking this is a great sequel and a nice wrap up to the story. I wasn't even thinking about any more sequels. Unfortunately, they went in a different direction and really killed the series with Aliens3 - I did not pay to see it because of all the negative publicity and just the fact that it really wasted the characters that were saved from the previous movie. I watched it later on and it was lousy and the whole story line disappointing . Alien resurrection was another bad attempt to revive the series and really you ask why? . I cant put all the Alien crossover stuff in the same category like Alien/Predator and all the comic book ones with Batman and Superman etc because they are all cash ins off Alien and not original ideas .I mean anyone can take something and toss it in the mix - like say Cowboys Vs Aliens where you start making stuff up and throwing it together. Like all the Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ideas because people start doing weird things - It can make for a fun movie but when you start milking the original idea too much and diluting it - it is just tired and needs to be left alone. The Alien franchise is a great story but I think books and novels are better than making more movies.",10,0,3,20 May 2012
District 9," Found it boring and annoying.
","The most annoying movie I've watched in years. It is a fictional docu-drama , lots of fictional TV interviews and news footage that bored the hell out of me. Full of unknown British actors and B-rates this movie is simply a mess. Directed by Peter Jackson who did Lord Of The Rings ,of course he had help in those movies and better material to work with. This movie suffers from every sci-fi clich√© , ugly aliens that look like bugs ,think grasshoppers check, lots of gore check, brutal military psycho check, lone human protagonist check. By the end of this movie which BTW went on an hr too long for me , you just want them to all blow up. And of course the ending is open ended with a sequel written all over it. 1 out of 10 ,Id give it a 0 if i could.",1,25,55,17 August 2009
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An orgasm for the eyes literally
","I mean this movie has so much to see and take in, Every detail , the creatures from orcs and goblins to trolls and monsters that are literally made out of the mountains - this movie is a wonderful orgasm for the eyes. The amazing scenery beautiful landscapes will make you forget you're in a movie theater.All of the actors hit the mark especially Ian McKellen as a bad ass Gandalf , he fights and fights and fights and is brutal with his staff and blade . We also have the Dwarfs and elves who look amazing. The fight in the goblin caves is tremendous as is the fight towards the end of the movie with the orcs. This movie is to be savored , at about 3 hrs it went surprisingly fast . I may see it again - wonderful movie magic here. 10/10 . I fell in love with Gandalf all over again",10,7,19,15 December 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Should have called it 'Stunts and Special Effects ' Pt 4
","In the way of movies - MI4 Ghost Protocol is another in a long line of let's fill up the screen with as much crap as we can . Busy does not mean good - it's boring. The same jump off a rooftop, car chases, crashes , fights , etc etc etc. MI4 tries so hard to take itself seriously but instead ends up one long car chase so to speak. Tom Cruise does his usual look at me I'm trying to be cool act which is about the same thing he does in every one of his movies. His team of agents also does the we look cool so watch us do these cool things . The plot if there is one about the Kremlin being blown up is boring - I fell asleep halfway through and wanted to just go home. The backers of this series are beating a dead horse trying to milk whatever else they can get out of it no matter how bad the script is or how long in the tooth Cruise gets . Sad thing is ,this movie will make money because Cruise's name is attached to it. Too many fanboys out there who don't care if a movie sucks as long as their boy or girl is in it will plunk down the bucks to see it over and over. 1/10 -Bomb",1,35,64,9 January 2012
2012," The special effects are the only thing good about this movie.
","The eye popping special effects involving earthquakes , monstrous tsunamis and other catastrophes swallowing cities and destroying famous landmarks are awesome. Other than that , the movie stinks. Let's start with the convoluted explanations of why the earth is going to end - the movies goes off in all different directions and the reasons implausible and ridiculous. We also have bad acting bordering on annoying along with one too many stupid scenes having people take time to argue while the earth is collapsing right behind them.Some times i wished for the protagonists to all die especially Gordon,Carl and Yuri along with Yuri's 2 spoiled evil twin sons who looked like the kid from the omen. The character of Gordon was so annoying - a first class whiner who just needed to STFU and fly the darn plane . Carl - a fat lard bucket windbag who needed to have his butt kicked and shutup - he was such a jerk. Yuri and his 2 kids -- a rich scheming scumbag and his kids evil to the core - if anyone deserved to die it was them and im glad one of them does die- i wont say who though.The ending of the movie was disappointing to me and somewhat of a cop out as if the writers couldn't come up with something more than a we survived now let's go to disneyland type finale. 10/10 for the special effects ,everything else is a 0",5,1,3,14 November 2009
The Mist," Pitiful Stephen King mess
","I like being scared and this movie starts off with some good scares,nifty gore and a genuine feeling of fear and high tension. Up to a certain point I was thinking man this is good scary fun and then it degenerates into so much crap starting with the religious psychopath,the endless whiny drivel of certain characters who could not act if their life depended on it.,case in point who the hell cast Thomas Jane?. The movie is rushed to a quick conclusion which is different from the books ending and will leave you really angry. I don't get Stephen Kings comment that the movies ending is the one he wished he had written. If you didn't like the ending Mr King then why write the damn ending you did. IMO, most of Stephen kings adaptations are boring mind numbing crap anyway which tells you about the source material but what really pmo off is that when one of them is actually good, they ruin it with bad acting,badly written dialog and deviate from the source material including changing the ending. Thomas Jane should be banned from acting forever- watch the last few minutes of the movie and you'll see what I mean.",1,2,9,14 November 2009
Big Hero 6," Rather boring Saturday morning anime type movie
",Went into this thinking it could be funny or cute. It was neither. Basically like watching a Saturday morning episode of some anime cartoon. Characters you don't care about and a plot that is pretty dumb even by kiddie standards. Anyone over the age of 7 will get bored quickly and want to leave. There is nothing amusing about the stay puff marshmallow man robot- i couldn't understand why a grown man in the audience was laughing when the robot was using scotch tape to patch holes in its body. It was stupid. And the whole superhero team of kids was annoying . The one guy who dressed up as a dragon i wanted to see die. Thats how bad it was for me.,3,99,256,15 November 2014
Brave," Chick flick/Small kid movie that disappoints.
","This movie is definitely for women in general. A young girl coming of age is told she must have a suitor and get married. She's a tomboy and wants to do her own thing and her mother and father want the opposite - that's about it . The rest of the movie is filled with low brow humor , typical slapstick violence and the usual moral of the story ending. After seeing the trailer and the movie poster ,one would think Brave would be about this young girl fighting and winning battles with her bow and arrow and a rousing adventure. Instead it's a dull boring coming of age story with not much to give except for the kids who like to watch cartoon bears and other creatures frolic around the woods and moms raising their bratty teenage daughters. 3/10 .",3,79,139,27 June 2012
Jurassic World," Nothing we haven't seen before
","The problem with this move is that it is nothing we haven't seen already in terms of originality. Jurassic Park introduced us to the exciting scary world of a dinsosaur amusement park gone wrong. Jurassic World does the same thing basically, the only difference is there is more money thrown into CGI and eye candy. The story is nothing new, the same dinsosaurs runnning amuck story and stupid ignorant kids in peril. I found it to be extremely stupid in a lot of scenes too. With people getting munched on by pteranodons in one scene , the main hero decides to kiss the heroine and the kids make smarmy faces, who cares that people are dying all around us , let's stand here and have a smooch . I hate tongue in cheek crap in movies aka SYFY made for TV crap. The training of the raptors was interesting to a point but even that plot element was wasted on an unbelievable turn of events at the climax of the movie. let's also not forget the scene where the heroine outruns a Tyrannosaurus Rex in heels when in Jurassic Park they had to go 60 mph in a jeep to outrun it. That and numerous other ridiculous scenes no doubt added to bring in more money . I am amazed at how much money this has made. It is a cash cow that's for sure. Seeing as how it's been several years since Jurassic Park 3 , one can only surmise a new generation is getting their parents to fork over that 15 a pop to see it again and again. amazing how good movies make less and are called crap while bad movies make tons of cash and are called amazing or special effects masterpieces. 1/10 and that's because I can't give it a zero",1,14,23,16 July 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Excellent and keeps your heart racing with excitement.!!!!
","Speaking as someone who has never read any of the books but has gotten more and more hooked on the whole Harry Potter mystic by reading up on it in on different websites, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix. Sometimes maybe its best if you haven't read the books before seeing the movie. I saw the Lord Of The Rings trilogy after having read the books many times and things were changed and things left out and I was a little critical myself but I still loved them.Lets face it if they wanted to stuff the amt of material the author wrote into one movie ,youd have to make two movies for each book. I've enjoyed each Harry Potter movie and eventually I will read the books to get the whole story but Id rather not do it yet since its so refreshing to not know what is going to happen going in.Its hard though with the net not getting spoilers everywhere so I will try not to followed the Deathly Hallows spoilers when the book comes out.Of course it will be 3 yrs before the final movie comes out. Now back to OOP - it was fantastic, the acting was good especially Dan Radcliffe ,such a range of expression and emotion on his face and the beautiful Emma Watson returns as a fierce Hermione. She really has punch. I loved the final battle at the end with the Death Eaters and of course Dumbledore vs Voldemort. It was sad seeing the fate of one of the main characters whom many fans have enjoyed. Hmm I wonder if that character will return in HBP or DH. All in all a grand time . I cant wait till HBP comes out next yr but we will have to wait until near Xmas time. And then 2 yrs after that what a wait that will be until DH comes out. See you at the movies.Cheers",10,8,13,13 July 2007
Puss in Boots," Cute but nothing to write home about
","Riding the coat tails of the popular although somewhat overdone Shrek movies comes Puss N Boots starring the voice talents of Antonio Banderas as the title character and Salma Hayek as his female cat counterpart Kitty Soft Paws. The movie is cute and has some good snappy banter and even a well choreographed cartoon dance fight that had me smiling. Antonio Banderas does really good with Puss and the facial expressions are amazingly patterned after his own face which adds to the overall quality of the character. Salma Hayek does good with Kitty Soft Paws too ,adding some fun. I didn't like Zach Galifianakis's Humpty Dumpty character though, besides the lazy voice over - it could have been Humpty N Boots as he basically takes over 75 percent of the movie with so much boring dialog and it just drags the movie down. There is too little time devoted to Puss's origin too and it never explains how he got in the baby buggy as a kitten either. They really needed to spend more time on Puss and not Humpty , the payoff to the story was kind of a letdown too as I think everyone knew that Humpty was in on the scam with the obvious clues and the whole mess of the big goose etc. Of course , the ending leaves it open for the inevitable sequel which I hope they write better and have a better overall story because this one had better potential and ends up being a 7/10 .",7,1,2,14 November 2011
Taken," Good action and Liam definitely rises above the material
","Very entertaining action flick with Liam in rambo mode as a divorced father who goes after his daughter who is kidnapped by human slave traders in Paris. Supposedly Liams' character was some type of commando in his earlier days and has deadly skills ,hand to hand combat and espionage. he uses his old commando buddies resources to help track down the kidnappers and boy does he ,leaving a trail of dead bodies. He does eventually find her in an explosive climax. If you don't think about certain plot holes you will really enjoy the movie. The main plot holes I saw were , how does he know people in french security- its never explained just implied they worked together before, he also fakes a french director or securities ID - how does he do that and how does he find out that someone on the inside of french security is involved in the selling of young girls including his old french security buddy. these are a few as well as shooting the wife of the traitor security buddy and beating him up - never explains how he wraps that up or gets out of the country with his daughter and what happens to the others, the daughters girlfriend he finds dead most likely of drug overdose yet he just leaves her there and no one asks about her. anyway , i enjoyed it and usually you will find plot holes in any kind of spy thriller.. Enjoy",9,0,0,19 May 2009
Avatar," Nice visual effects but otherwise is boring and assumes too much.
","This movie has one major flaw in my opinion - no back story - it assumes that the audience is already familiar with the history of the plot - it just starts off with humans on the planet pandora (obviously weve been there for years) according to the very brief narration and that weve been trying to work things out with the creatures known as the N'avi. Now ,i know nothing about anything going into this movie . so i have no idea who anyone is ,who the navi are or why we are on pandora - its like jumping into the middle of a book that you have never read. I for one don't like movies that have no backstory and just make things up along the way. We find out that avatars are some type of hybrid alien/human bodies that humans can transfer their consciousness into and inhabit, OK now im really lost ? there is never any story behind it all. such as what happened to earth , when did we discover pandora and why are we there to begin with , its all just assumed that we the audience are ignorant. eventually we find out that the greedy humans along with a military wack job want to plunder pandora for a material that is worth millions. so we have the hero become an avatar and ends up falling in love with a native catlike girl alien and then it becomes a clich√©d battle with unbelievable bad dialog and too much visual effects that are designed to make you forget that the movie is another 2 hours long..Like I said in the title of my review. Nice visual effects but otherwise -a confusing disjointed borefest. 3/10.",3,3,8,27 December 2009
Super 8," Overall the movie is a letdown and the ending is a copout
","I went into this movie knowing it was PG-13 which nowadays means scary for a 13yo and little violence and if anyone does get killed it's off screen or blurred. There are one or 2 deaths that are violent enough to border on an r rating but everything else is kiddie. The special effects and shock moments that have you jump are not bad but they alone cant carry this movie. Some of the acting is pretty bad and it drags quite frequently. The kids act better than the adults and their range of emotion is why I didn't lower my rating even more. The ending is typical Spielberg schtick and a definite cop out as if they couldn't figure out how to end it and maybe threw ideas into a hat and picked one. I saw it in an IMAX theater which I'd recommend especially for the train crash scene or you'll miss the feel of it. Overall a 7/10 , the kids acting is a 10 the rest of the movie is a 4.",7,3,7,11 June 2011
Up," Wonderful movie -
","Just got back from seeing 'UP' and it was a very entertaining movie. Lots of neat special effects and it really did make you feel as if you were up in the air with the main characters. The plot involving a 76 yo man Carl Fredericksen wanting to experience adventure before he dies is charming and heartfelt. Along with him for various parts of his journey are a young cub scout and other characters like a talking dog and a large bird. I can see why the movie is rated PG though as their are some parts that I think would be too scary or too intense for the under 10 crowd - such as the part where one dog brutally bites another dog and throws it off a cliff and the duel between Carl and Charles Muntz which is rather intense- Carl gets kicked in the chest by Muntz and nearly impaled several times while fighting Muntz who is armed with a large sword.Otherwise,I loved the animation - I didn't get to see it in 3d but an article said that you get more in the 2d version. Either way, totally enjoyable and the voice actors especially the Asian kid were a treat on the ears. Ed Asner is perfect as Carl who himself looks like an older Spencer Tracy look alike - he may be rough on the outside but has a warm heart and really cares. Enjoy the movie and the wonderful animation. 10 out of 10.",10,1,4,2 June 2009
Prometheus," Disappointing and over-hyped
","The whole premise sounded exciting but it really is all about eye-candy and a few gross out scares. The story about where we came from and how it ties into the Alien franchise is one big overblown mess. From the discovery of ancient wall paintings to going to a planet that is similar in appearance and location as to the one in Alien. A group of space explorers including the founder of the Weyland group travel to a planet far out into space to find the meaning of our origins only to discover in horror that the beings they find are not benevolent and also carrying a cargo of bio-weapons gone crazy. The references to Alien are there especially the ending which serves as somewhat of a prequel to the original Alien. However the planet is not the same one that Ripley and her crew travel to in the first Alien movie hinting that these engineers had ships crash on other moons orbiting the same planet as the LV designations indicate. The biggest problem is so many plot elements are not explained or explored enough - we find out that the engineers DNA is a match for ours and that they may have created us but why are they carrying these Alien type creatures , why is one of them still hibernating ,what caused them to crash , and are they coming back to destroy the human race or ? At the end of the movie the lone survivor issues a warning to others to stay away and that she is going off on another engineers ship to find out where they came from and then the Alien chestburster finale. We all know that Ripleys crew received a beacon from a planet that turned out to be a warning to stay away however it was not the planet in this movie so who left that warning beacon and it's quite obvious in the first movie that an engineer died from a chestburster so someone must have found that ship before Ripleys crew and left a warning - it wasn't the engineers as she was able to decipher it and also how does the android David know about the black containers on the engineers ship and seems to know about the life they contain? So many unanswered questions and so many jumpy scenes . I was disappointed 5/10",5,2,6,9 June 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Wonderful movie and I've never read the books
","A wonderful movie and when Snape is dying I got choked up even more so when Harry finally sees who Snape really is and why he acted the way he did towards Harry. A lot of fighting that is brutal and graphic and also very sad when you see who dies. There is a scene of the death eater who is a werewolf gnawing at Luna Lovegoods dead corpse which gave me chills until Harry blasts him out the window which I applauded. Also the duels between Mcgonagall and Snape and Molly Weasley and Bellatrix that are scene stealer's. I loved how Mrs Weasley went ballistic on Bellatrix after she nearly kills Ginny. And tough old broad Maggie Smith shows you why you shouldn't mess with McGonagall - now whether or not Snape had no attention of fighting back, she really lays into him with some serious curses regardless. I wish though that they could have had a better ending , I blame that on Rowling who simply ended it without any wrap-up to the surviving characters -even though I didn't read any of the books i had to see how she ended it compared to the movies ending and its the same so i couldn't blame it all on the people who adapted the book to a movie although from what I've heard from the people who were devoted Potter fans who read the books that a lot of stuff was either cut out or redone differently and really ticked off a lot of the more devoted fans of the books. I can sympathize with that as I thought Lord of The Rings overblown inclusion of Arwen when she was barley mentioned in the books to be more so for the hormone ravaged young boys to gawk at than any real importance .And while the epilogue ending written by Rowling is meant to be heartfelt and sentimental , it was not really fitting in my opinion .skipping ahead 19 years for some reason ,why 19 who knows but it felt forced,with little dialog and no real chemistry between the characters,the makeup effects to make them look older were rather poor and that is why i give this movie a 9 and not a 10.",9,2,3,17 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best of the trilogy ,watch the extended DVDs or you miss out.
","The best , better than the three films ranked above it in the IMDb. Sorry godfather fans but I hated the godfather and do not think it belongs in the top 10 let alone the farce of being number one.Anyways,I got my hands on the extended edition DVDs of ROTK and there is so much extra stuff.The main thing left out of the theatrical release that I wanted to see was the final fate of Saruman.It is included in the extended edition but it doesn't follow the books version. In the book after the ring was destroyed,Saruman had fled out of Isengard and came to the Shire with Grima Wormtongue ,there they tried to take over the Shire with the help of some ruffians and orcs , they were defeated by hobbits led by Merry and Pippin in what was called The Battle Of Bywater.Frodo confronted the defeated Saruman who was brought to BagEnd and banished him from the Shire .However as Saruman was leaving he berated Grima one last time which sent Grima over the edge with hatred, he came up behind Saruman and slit his throat and before Frodo could stop them ,some other hobbits shot Grima dead with arrows.In the extended edition of the movie, Gandalf,Aragorn,Gimli,Legolas and King Theoden arrive at Isengard where they are greeted by Merry and Pippin ,there is some small talk and then a conversation between Gandalf and Treebeard.Saruman then appears from the top of his tower with Grima behind him. He sends fire down at Gandalf who repels it and breaks Sarumans staff, King Theoden then tells Grima that he can come back to Rohan and all is forgiven ,to start a new life. Saruman then berates Grima as useless fodder and shoves him to the ground. Grima then gets angry and stabs Saruman in the back,he falls off the tower and gets impaled on a waterwheel that drags him under the water. Legolas shoots Grima with an arrow killing him. I liked the books ending better ,Peter Jackson evidently thought a major battle at the end of the movie would have been too much excess so he left out the Battle of Bywater much to the chagrin of fans and changed Sarumans death scene,Christoper Lee was majorly po'ed when it was cut out of the theatrical release-I would have been too as he was also cut from the ending credits in the theatrical release,he does however get credit in t he extended edition credits. That scene being cut out was one thing I didn't understand,the scene was no more than ten minutes long but Peter Jackson said that the scene was cut out due to time constraints and pacing, I don't buy that B/S - Saruman was a major player in the books and that scene should have been included in the theatrical release. I think some Hollywood politics were going on and someone just didn't like Mr Lee being in the third movie- there were rumors that Peter Jackson did not get along with Mr Lee and so he decided to cut Mr Lee out of ROTKs theatrical release,Brad Dourif also got the snub from the theatrical release. Oh well, the film is just pure wonder,top notch acting and incredible special effects,the battle scenes alone are worth watching the 4 plus hrs of extras. If you haven't already, go buy the extended edition ,its filled with goodies and extras including the Wellington parade and world premiere event , with clips and video of the stars walking down the street signing autographs.Enjoy LOTR fans",10,2,4,18 December 2006
Looper," The problem with Time Travel movies ,major spoilers
","You cannot think about this movie seriously or you'll go nuts. As with all time travel movies , the paradox problem is always there of course not to mention the numerous plot holes which can never be explained. Like why was time travel illegal in the future ? and why was it not possible to dispose of bodies in the future,it's mentioned that people were tagged,in what way could someone be found if they were atomized in a vat of acid or similar way of disposal?.Or Why not just go back in time like Bruce Willis'character does and kill the person when they are a defenseless child and erase them from existence. But if you do that then they wouldn't have existed in the future you came from in the first place.Too many things that are not theoretically possible.Like if you die in the past, your future self would never exist which basically makes the whole movie a huge plot hole which is always going to be the case involving time travel movies. I did like the first half of the movie but the second half bogged down way too much and the ending too abrupt and too many questions left unanswered/unexplained. 7/10",7,4,18,29 September 2012
The Godfather," OMFG - This movie is so overrated it's disgusting
","A 9.1 on IMDb? cat-scans please .I've never seen a worse depiction of Italians in my life. More like caricatures and stereotyping Italians from the turn of the century as smug talking idiots with Im gonna bust you upside yer f** head as the main dialog - every one is depicted as a ghetto talking grease monkey. Marlon Brando is a disgusting fat slob of a mafia boss - his offer you cant refuse scene is so laughably bad. All the rest of the cast looks like something out of a bad B movie with tough guy talk and slapping women around to be macho. James Caan is simply awful - he always trys hamming it up in every movie hes in as does Al Pacino. The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring. I give it a big fat zero.",1,26,88,18 December 2006
