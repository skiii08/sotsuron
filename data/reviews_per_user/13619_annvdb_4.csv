Hereditary," it gets good but ending part ruined it
","All in all, I enjoyed watching the movie. Had some jump scares and scary scenes bit after he flees to the attic, it gets kind of ridiculous and some scenes looked really fake to me. So really wish did they something different with the end part.Not that scary for me. And honestly the jump scares made me laugh afterwards. So I can see why some reviewers said some people in the theater were laughing, cause I was.",6,0,1,1 July 2018
Beauty and the Beast," Beautiful movie
","10 out of 10 from me... I thought it was incredibly beautiful and I can fault nothing. Loved it from start to end and the beast song was my favorite. I cried several times :)The cgi was beautiful, the whole setting. How they showed some of the backstory to Belle and the Beast and how they became like that + why the servants also got transformed and punished.",10,7,21,18 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Amazing and hilarious
","Loved this movie even more than the first one! great story, Epic cgi, actors on point as always, and very hilarious. The whole room was in stitches so many times. The jokes are so well done and the actors are just perfectly executing the lines. It makes you feel like they couldn't have picked anyone better you know. Really recommend this to everyone!",10,11,21,28 April 2017
Black Panther," Meh
","I like black panther, he is a badass character, but this movie was kind of boring to me. I dont know what it was exactly, but I just didnt enjoy it that much. Only at the end it picked up and was better. But definitely dont agree with some people hyping it. 
My favorite character is probably his sister :)",4,7,12,28 February 2018
