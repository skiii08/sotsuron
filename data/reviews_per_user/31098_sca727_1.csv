Airlift," Airlift a Movie To be proud of.. take a bow akshay kumar
","Airlift is a movie which all of us should be proud of .. Akshay kumar's acting was awesome.. the direction.. the way of telling the story of 170000 refugees its an edge of seat thriller drama movie & every Indian should watch it.. when i went to watch the movie i thought it would be a normal thriller movie nothing new.. but when i came out of the hall i had goosebumps on my body.. I say this again.. akshay kumar is awesome.. only he can does such movies like baby,holiday,gabbar is back & airlift.. we all are proud of you akshay sir.. the movie is amazing & should cross the 100 Cr. Mark everyone.. this one shouldn't be missed :)",9,0,1,26 January 2016
