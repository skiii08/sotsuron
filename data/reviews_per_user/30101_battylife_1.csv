Alien 3," Not as good as the first two, but still a scary flick.
","I'm a huge fan of the Alien series. Alien was great and Aliens was a master piece. As expected a lot of pressure was put on Alien 3, and sadly it didn't deliver. But then again I didn't expect it to. How many movie series have had three hits in a row? Star Wars pops to mind, but not a whole lot more.So let's talk about what the film did right. For starters Alien 3 succeeds in presenting a very dark and depressing mood. It introduces a new type of alien which looks cool and creative and helps keep the movie feeling fresh. The acting is also top notch.It did do a few things wrong. For starters the majority of characters are forgettable and for the most part not very like able. The CGI effects are awful. The aliens color will change and its movements don't look realistic at all. Luckily you'll mostly get close ups of it so it won't be CGI.In conclusion it's the best in the alien series, but still succeeds in providing a few good scares. I give the theatrical cut a 7/10 and the extended cut a 7.5/10.",7,1,1,3 December 2010
