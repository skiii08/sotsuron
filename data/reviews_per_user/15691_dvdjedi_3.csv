The Blair Witch Project," An excellent movie that is more of a suspense film than a true horror film.
","The Blair Witch Project is a film that is more like Psycho than a true horror film such as Friday The 13th or Nightmare On Elm St. It builds tension as it goes & results in an excellent payoff at the end. While this film is not the greatest that I have ever seen it is certainly better than most of the garbage coming out of Hollywood recently (Urban Legend, The Faculty, etc.)",8,1,2,30 July 1999
Casablanca," As close to a perfect film as can be!
","Casablanca is just about as perfect a film as there can be. Everything from the casting, direction, cinematography, & music to the acting, script, & sound is just about perfect. It doesn't get any better than this.",10,2,2,8 July 2002
Gone with the Wind," A spectacular example of 'classic' Hollywood films
","They don't make films quite like this anymore. GWTW is an amazing film that manages to do everything right: acting, directing, casting, cinematography, costumes, screenplay, editing, score, etc. It is impossible to imagine anyone other than Clark Gable, Vivian Leigh, Olivia de Haviland, & Leslie Howard playing these roles that seem made for them. This film takes the viewer back to Civil War America so convincingly that you cannot help but be pulled into the world of Scarlett O'Hara. It is amazing that the 3 best films, in my opinion, ever (the other 2 being Casablanca & Citizen Kane) were made within 4 years of each other. Watch this film & you will be transported to a time & place that is now. . . gone with the wind.",10,1,1,21 July 1999
