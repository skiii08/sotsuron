The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Enjoyed it
","Alright, I've read the books and seen the movies. I have never been a 'Twi-hard' fan, but I definitely enjoy the books and the films that follow.This franchise is simply created to bring in the money. After seeing the first three movies, I had no high expectations on this fourth installment. I'm well aware that the dialogue is ridiculously cheesy (especially on Taylor Lautner's end). I've seen a majority of these actors in other films and they are, in fact, pretty damn good. However, with the cheesy dialogue in the Twilight series, not even Robert de Niro can deliver those lines and make them sound good. But, let's face it...the storyline is what draws the fans in, not the poor script. Throw in some hot actors and you got yourself a box office hit.I found Kristen Stewart to be SO much more tolerable in this film than in any other. As goes for Taylor Lautner. That dude usually can't act to save his life, but even HE was better in this film. Robert Pattinson has pretty much stayed the same throughout the 4 films and held his own. Can't say the same for ANYONE in the wolf pack.Out of the entire film, there was only one scene that was incredibly awful and I was laughing the whole time because it was just uncomfortable. That was the wolf scene with all the telepathy. My god, they could have done that SO much differently and made bearable. If that's how the wolf telepathy is, then I'm glad that they left that out of the films this whole time. There was supposed to be much more of that according to the book and I am happy to say that they only kept that one scene.As for the rest of the movie, I enjoyed it. The wedding was stunning (as was the back of Bella's dress) and the birth was gruesome but in the best way. And I think anyone will agree that watching Bella turn into a vampire was pretty awesome with the CGI. Overall, I think this movie depicted the book far better than the previous three. If you've read the book, go see the film.",Null,3,11,21 November 2011
