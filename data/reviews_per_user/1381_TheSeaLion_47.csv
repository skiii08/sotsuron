Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How is this one considered the worst?
","After the release of 'Revenge of the Sith' in 2005 and with the original and prequel trilogies complete, 'The Phantom menace' was hailed by many as the worst movie in the entire saga. While it does lack a lot of what made the originals spectacular films, this is the one prequel that does not leave me annoyed after viewing it.Yes, 'The Phantom Menace' does have some of the most hated things in the 'Star Wars' franchise like Jar Jar Binks, midi-chlorians, and a plot that is based around the taxation of trade routes. However, of all of the prequels, it has the best story, best acting, and least amount of awful dialog.Awful dialog is still present in this film but it only comes from child actor Jake Lloyd (I am not saying he is a bad actor now). The acting is not great, especially with Natalie Portman's Queen Amidala, however, I feel this is her best acting of the entire prequel trilogy as it does not come off as annoying and whiny.This film at least manages to have a story that can be followed and is not just shot after shot of CGI crammed in everywhere. The CGI in this film is much more subtle.My main problem is that I do not get the motivations of the bad guys and a lot of the reasons there is a plot is unexplained. We don't know anything about the taxes nor why Naboo was picked as the targeted planet.This film is not great but it has a few fun moments like with the podrace and there is an epic lightsaber duel at the end which is the best out of all three prequels, proving that it is the best out of the prequels.",2,2,5,5 August 2013
Iron Man 3," An epic conclusion to a series
","'Iron Man 3' brings the 'Iron Man' franchise back on track after the poorly made 'Iron Man 2' and brings the audience a satisfying conclusion to one of their more popular super heroes.There were a lot of ideas that were creative and interesting, particularly the Mandarin being a washed up actor instead of an actual terrorist leader and the story focusing more on Tony Stark and not Iron Man because if the man behind the hero is boring then there is less interest in the character itself.While it was the funniest one, which I liked, it felt at times like there were several screenwriters, one who thought it was supposed to be a darker chapter of the 'Iron Man' movies and one who thought it was supposed to be a comedy film. Having comedy in a film is fine but this is not a comedy film and there are a lot of times where jokes are overplayed or shoved in for no reason.With the development of Stark's character, I am satisfied with the series as a whole and do not believe another film is needed. In fact, if another film were to be put into production, I feel it would harm this movie and the character of Tony Stark as a whole.",7,3,7,2 August 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," An example of film at its best
","From director Steven Spielberg comes yet another masterpiece that proves that he is the master of cinema. With a fun adventure and story, Spielberg pulls the audience into a believable world with characters that feel real and a mission to get a stranded alien back home.After discovering an alien hiding in his backyard, a young boy, Elliott (Henry Thomas) and his siblings keep the alien hidden while he sets up a communications array to contact his planet. One of the best parts of this film is with the casting and acting. With the main cast consisting primarily of younger actors, they do not weigh the film down like most child actors do. Another things this film can do well is pull emotions out of the audience. This lacks in a lot of famous films, but the sympathy and connections you feel with the characters makes you care about what is happening as if you were the one involved.Like other films by Spielberg, primarily 'Jurassic Park', 'E.T.' has a target audience of everyone and will appeal to people of all ages. My only complaint is that I could not hear the dialog at some points but I write that off to my poor sound system. Either way, 'E.T.' is a fun sci-fi adventure film that will appeal to any age group.",6,2,4,2 August 2013
Fight Club," Fincher's weakest work
","'Fight Club' is one of those movies where you need to watch it more than once to fully understand what happened in the movie. The problem is that 'Fight Club' leaves you with no reason to re-watch it other than to know if the movie is actually a complex but brilliant masterpiece, or an overrated film that just barely rises above mediocrity. I guess I will have to stay with believing the latter because nothing makes me want to return.The narrator (Edward Norton), who is suffering from insomnia, meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a company trip. When the narrator returns to his apartment, he finds that it has been destroyed and, with no one else to go to, calls Tyler. The narrator moves into Tyler's house and one night, upon Tyler's request, the narrator punches him. The two begin to fight and attract a crowd of people, which becomes Fight Club. 'Fight Club' is hailed as a brilliant social commentary about consumerism and how we as people live our lives now, though it isn't saying anything more than any other person or form of media that has spoken up about consumerism, and at the same time is feeding the viewer a false idea. Tyler says, 'An entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy sh*t we don't need.' Right, because there are no other reasons why people would be working these jobs that they hate? Not everything is about consumerism. Some people have jobs for that reason, but others have certain situations in their lives which makes them have to take these white collar jobs even if they hate it. In all fairness, the movie does save itself a bit by disapproving of Tyler's radical plans, but it is still trying to pass off his ideas as an important message when his they are flawed.Carrying on the theme of trying to be brilliant but failing, let's take a look at the plot. So, Tyler is just a figment of the Narrator's imagination because of his insomnia. Okay, got it. So, the Narrator is fighting himself in the parking lot of the bar when a group of guys comes out to watch and decides that they want to fight as well, which means that they were the first people to join fight club. But, they saw that there was obviously something wrong with the Narrator because he's fighting himself, so why would they end up following a guy who was obviously not all there? He wasn't spreading his propaganda about consumerism at the time either, so they weren't following him because they believed his ideas. Then, the twist that Tyler was in the Narrator's head the whole time is one of the laziest twists in cinematic history. Ignoring the fact that it barely makes sense like with the example I gave above, the twist of something being in a character's mind is like a film student level idea when they're trying to be deep. Then, to get rid of Tyler, the Narrator shoots himself in the head and that somehow kills him. I've heard that it's supposed to symbolize that the Narrator was finally able to let go of Tyler and is able to make his own choice now, but to me, symbolism only works if it makes sense. What it's symbolizing makes sense, how it's done doesn't.Along with Pitt and Norton, Helena Bonham Carter (Marla) also appears in the film, who is used for nothing more than additional pointless drama, that makes no sense in the grand scheme of things. It is said throughout the whole movie that the Narrator doesn't like Marla, but the side of him that's Tyler at least tolerates her or has romantic feelings towards her or something. So, at the end, when Project Mayhem is about to go through with its master plan, the Narrator warns Marla to leave town and when she's captured, he goes to help her. Now, it makes a little sense that he might feel guilty about getting her involved, even though he was willing to let her die earlier in the film, but then it implies some sort of deeper connection between them, even though it was the Tyler side of the Narrator that liked her, and it's shown that the Narrator and Tyler both have different ideas and thoughts, so they are individuals, but now the Narrator suddenly cares about Marla.'Fight Club' is a movie with a flawed understanding of society that, while it's condemning the actions of Tyler Durden, it is promoting his flawed logic as some sort of important message about society and how we live our lives. This movie comes off to me one of those films that actually has very little or nothing new to say, but people believe it has an important commentary to it and praise it even though it's nothing more or less than mediocre and barely worth remembering. I like David Fincher a lot and while, based on what I've seen, I don't believe he's made a bad movie yet, this is cutting is pretty close.",5,4,11,16 November 2014
Alien: Resurrection," Resurrection is the death of the 'Alien' franchise
","While I found 'Alien 3' to not be that great and be extremely mediocre, 'Alien: Resurrection' proves to be the worst of the 'Alien' films in my opinion and does many things that I find infuriating in film. The third film had a great ending to it with the intense game of cat and mouse through the prison and Ripley's sacrifice so that the Weyland Corporation could not get its hands on the alien. Everything is tied up nicely and there are no lose ends.Then, along comes 'Alien: Resurrection', which is the true road to ruin for the 'Alien' movies. We open up at least a thousand years later after the events of 'Alien 3'. Ripley has been cloned and the Weyland Corporation is also trying to recreate the alien species, succeeding in making several clones using kidnapped humans collected by mercenaries as hosts. The aliens soon mature and escape, damaging the ship.The first things that really infuriated me with this movie was with Ripley being alive because she was cloned. I do not like characters who die to come back to life in movies unless they are like ghosts or the method for their resurrection is set up ahead of time. So, Ripley is alive because she was the star of the first three films so they need her to be in it or it will not be a true 'Alien' film. That is what it felt like to me.My next biggest issue was with the new creature introduced in the movie. The three movies before it had clever ideas, even if they were mild. 'Alien' introduced us to the species and the face-huggers, 'Aliens' gave us the idea of a queen alien, and the third one had an alien but since it came out of a dog and not a human, it behaved a little like a dog would. What this film did was not even remotely clever. They had a half- human half-alien hybrid. This just screams to me that they wanted something new but could not think of something remotely clever so they did one of the most cliché things imaginable, mixing a human with the creature.Another problem I had was with the movie all together. It had nothing for the audience besides aliens hunting down and killing the humans. The characters were uninteresting--not that the characters from the first three films were works of art but they at least made you care--so we did not care if they succeeded or not as the only person we might be able to relate to is Ripley, but she's a clone and not the real Ripley so there is nothing from that. The film is played off more as aliens in 'Poseidon' as the characters are escaping from a ship, going through different obstacles while aliens instead of rising water are following them. There is little tension as they could easily defeat the aliens. They have firepower and there is less than ten aliens. In 'Alien' and 'Alien 3', they had little to no weapons and in 'Aliens' they had weapons but not enough to fight them all. There was tension with that. In this, the characters are all armed and there are few enough aliens that they could just fight them off, ergo, no tension. To try and compensate for this, they have one mercenary in a wheelchair and a guy with an embryo in him that is about to erupt from his chest, but both of these fail to bring tension to the audience.While I would watch 'Alien: Resurrection' over other films I have seen, the film fails on multiple levels and takes the 'Alien' franchise from having an ending that was pretty good to a lousy ending where we are left with our surviving characters sitting around with a 'what happens now?' thought running through the audience's brains.",4,0,2,14 August 2013
Ted," From the creator of 'Family Guy': What were you expecting?
","When I first saw this film and wrote up my original review of it on this site, I only viewed it as a dumb, unfunny comedy created by Seth MacFarlane that I had an extreme hate for. After so time passed, I came to realize that my problems with 'Ted' came from more than just the fact that I did not find it to be all that funny. To be fair, I will say 'Ted' is one of Seth MacFarlane's better works, easily surpassing his animated TV shows 'Family Guy' and 'The Cleveland Show', but not reaching the level that 'American Dad' is at.After thinking about it a little, I realized that my main problem with the film was not the humor, as the first twenty minutes and the last thirty minutes had sufficient enough humor from me to warrant at least a positive view of the film. The middle of the film is bogged down in so much of the humor style that MacFarlane has become known for that I lost interest in the humor and moved my full attention on the plot, which I had even less interest in.The plot of the film is not too original for a comedy film. It is a typical romance versus bromance where John's (Mark Wahlberg) girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) wants Ted (MacFarlane) to move out of the apartment in hopes that their relationship will become more mature. Ted does move out but John finds himself blowing off Lori and other parts of his life to hang out with Ted. When John ditches a party thrown by Lori's boss (Joel McHale), it's Lori's last straw and she breaks up with John. John, with occasional help from Ted, tries to make up with Lori and rekindle their relationship.There were several problems I noticed with the middle chunk of the film when the comedy died down to almost nothing with a few chuckle-worthy moments every now and then. The biggest problem was that John and Lori had no chemistry together. I did not buy the fact that they were a couple and I could not muster an iota of investment to their story. If the film had focused on John and Ted trying to remain friends because of John's relationship with Lori, the film would have worked because the two had good chemistry. I never felt like John and Lori were emotionally connected on any level, so I did not care if they got back together or not.Next, the film felt like an elongated episode of 'Family Guy', but with a beginning and an end that was at the very least a little funny. The film was filled with pop cultural references and other comedy that MacFarlane has become known for, a really stupid plot line with bad attempts at drama, and scenes that try to be emotional but are either ruined by trying to insert comedy or played for laughs. The beginning of the film is not like this and the ending tones it down a little, but for the most part, the entire film is like this.While my opinion of 'Ted' has increased to a level where I can see what people find funny about it and why some do like it, my opinion has not changed to the point where I actually like this movie. It is still dumb and boring with nothing to care about, complete with the usual junk that gets worked into MacFarlane's work. It had some fun moments and it shows that MacFarlane can be funny, but that is about it.",4,10,17,30 July 2013
Don Jon," Levitt is a good director and actor, but not a good writer
","'Don Jon' is the writing and directorial debut of actor Joseph Gordon- Levitt. While Levitt has shown in the past that he is a talented actor, and 'Don Jon' shows that he can be a good director, the film also shows that Levitt is not a very good writer. 'Don Jon' attempts to make a realistic portrayal of modern relationships with a message to it, but everything is done so simplistically that it comes across as realistic as the relationships in 'That '70s Show'.Jon (Levitt), or Don Jon, nicknamed by his friends, is addicted to porn because he finds it more engaging than actual sex. At a club, he tries to hook up with a woman he sees (Scarlett Johansson), but ultimately fails. Jon, thinking that a long-term relationship might be the key to good sex, asks around about the woman, Barbara Sugarman, before finding her on Facebook and asking her out on a date. As their relationship progresses, Barbara asks Jon to expand his future by attending a college course and forbids him from watching porn. At the college course, he meets a woman named Esther (Julianna Moore).The relationship between Jon and Barbara is supposed to be a representation of a modern day relationship, but it takes more of a comedic standpoint on modern relationships than a realistic one, which would be fine if the movie was supposed to be a satire, but it wasn't. The aspect of Barbara not allowing Jon to watch porn and getting him to take a college course is something you can see happen in relationships, but then there's a part to show how poorly compatible they are that she forbids Jon from buying cleaning supplies for his apartment. The relationship between Jon and Esther is also predictable once she starts bonding with Jon. You can see that Jon and Barbara are not working out and that Esther is more understanding that Barbara. All the movie leads up to is that even though Esther is older than Jon, they were more compatible because they understood each other better, which you can figure out well before the movie is over.Jon is depicted as being a hardcore religious guy who goes to church and confession every week. After Barbara forbids him from watching porn, he lies to the priest (Paul Ben-Victor) in confession that he stopped watching porn. It is never given any explanation for why he did that. It's not as if the priest can tell Barbara that he is lying to her and wouldn't Jon consider lying in confession something he should never do?Throughout the movie, Jon goes to visit his family and has dinner with them. His sister (Brie Larson) is constantly on her phone whenever she is seen, until the end when she explains why Jon and Barbara broke up. She was a completely pointless character who existed just to explain something to another character.As I said before, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a good actor and 'Don Jon' does show that he has the skills to be a good director. However, the movie also shows that Levitt's writing, not only of the story but also dialogue, is not good. There is supposed to be a realistic depiction of modern relationships, but the relationship is portrayed as something right out of a comedy, which I said would work if this were satire, but it isn't.",3,1,5,6 August 2014
Zodiac," A roller coaster of suspense
","Based around a string of actual murders in the years of 1968-1969, 'Zodiac' follows the journey of Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) and David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) as they try to discover the identity of the elusive serial killer who has begun sending letters to the police department with embedded information. The film succeeds as the reincarnation of an actual event on film and as an original idea for a film. If the Zodiac murders never took place, this would be an exceptional and ingenious mystery drama, but since they did happen, it still does well as the reincarnation of the events of film.The performances given by Gyllenhaal, Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. (Paul Avery) are superb and they give it their all. Other honorable mentions include Anthony Edwards (William Armstrong), and John Carroll Lynch (Arthur Leigh Allen).Using the elements of visuals, the suspense skyrockets by using elements from a gloomy day to a sudden noise to a plain creepy setting to build suspense up in the audience. They use every trick in the book except not showing us who the killer is and if he is lurking nearby to get us fearful that the killer might have his next victim.",10,2,2,31 July 2013
Lost in Translation," A one in a million kind of film
","Who would have thought that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson would have such great chemistry? Not me until I saw this masterpiece of cinematography a few weeks ago. I did not have much of an interest in watching this movie when I first heard how great it was and decided to watch it. After viewing it, I realized I wished I'd seen it sooner.Bob Harris (Murray) is an actor who has arrived in Tokyo to shoot a commercial. Charlotte (Johansson) is a young woman who married young and is in Tokyo with her husband (Giovanni Ribsi) who is a celebrity photographer on business. Harris is going through a mid-life crisis while Charlotte feels she made a mistake marrying when she was so young. The two will form an unlikely bond with one another and take the audience on an experience through their different worlds and problems. The slow pace of the film helps it feel like the buildup of their relationship is actually taking time instead of happening all at once. The two share a lot of things in common, including having problems with where they are in life right now and a feeling of loneliness which adds depth to both the characters and their relationship. Instead of telling the story about these two very different yet very similar people form an emotional connection with each other, the film takes you on the experience they have and how the connection between them grows.The visuals and setting of the film in Tokyo provides for an interesting location that plays a role in adding depth to the story and characters using its subtle symbolism. Both Bob and Charlotte feel alienated in their lives as if they do not belong there, and Tokyo to them is an unfamiliar and alien place to them with a different culture and language then they're used to. I thought Scarlett Johansson was an okay actress from the performance I witnessed in the 'Marvel' films 'Iron Man 2' and 'The Avengers', but her performance in this made me realize how talented she is and has made her one of my favorite actresses. Bill Murray I already liked and knew was good actor from his performance in 'Ghostbusters', but this shows he can do comedy as well as serious drama. I would actually love to see Murray do some more serious roles because you can tell he is built for both funny and serious with his performance in this. Another good acting job in the film was Anna Faris of the 'Scary Movie' franchise as an American actress named Kelly. The best part of the whole film is the relationship that Bob and Charlotte share with one another. We get a front row seat as the two take the audience on a journey through the experience they shared together and how it shaped their relationship. The two have great chemistry and have a strong relationship that the audience wants to route for. The best part of the relationship, I think, is that it allows the audience to believe what they want to believe with it. I personally believe that it is just a very strong friendship that they share while others think that they have some romantic chemistry between them. Whatever the case is, I like that it took the chance and the film did not tell us, but instead lets the individual viewer believe what they take from it all.'Lost in Translation' is a one in a million film that while simple in premise is deep in all other areas. Murray and Johansson have good chemistry, the setting of the film plays an interesting role in symbolizing how the two feel, there are good performances in the movie, and the film allows us to decide what we want about the two, 'Lost in Translation' is a modern day masterpiece and dives into great detail about a simple bond that two people share.",7,1,1,2 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the critic
","After the release of 'Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace', most people thought that it was the worst film in the 'Star Wars' franchise and would always be. Three years later, in 2002, they were proved wrong.The fifth film by release date, 'Attack of the Clones' is an example of a poorly written story with characters and dialog that are laughably bad. Unlike with 'Revenge of the Sith' and 'The Phantom Menace', I can not seem to find anything other than part of the arena sequence that I liked in this film that was not carried over from the previous films. Starting off the bat, I know something is wrong. I am already asking questions based on the information that the opening crawl has given me. That is not a good sign.Next, we have our plot that is a mix of a romance, mystery, action, and adventure that is poorly glued together. We have a mystery tone with Obi-Wan trying to solve a 'who done it' mystery while Anakin and Padme go off and have a romance tone. The two tones mix poorly and I am left annoyed after every change between the two stories.Each step of the story left me either bored, annoyed, or confused, and then we come to the big final battle. I enjoyed the arena sequence when it started out with the Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Padme fending off three giant monsters without any weapons other than their own ingenuity. Then the Jedi came and everything went down the drain with a large, seizure inducing battle that I had little interest in because there was no tension.After that, the surviving Jedi escape and Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda duel Count Dooku who escapes after injuring Anakin and Obi-Wan. Even with the final shots of the film, the tone still fluctuates poorly between a mysterious tone with Dooku and Sidious and with Windu, Yoda, and Obi- Wan, a dramatic tone with Palpatine watching the new clone army, and a romance tone with Anakin and Padme getting married.The dialog and characters are terrible in this film. Anakin is whiny, complains about Obi-Wan all of the time, and is completely arrogant, and we are supposed to feel sympathy and understand his anger when he kills a bunch of Tusken Raiders for killing his mother. If we can not feel sympathy for such a terrible person, we will not understand why he is doing what he does as it feels to us like he deserves it. The romance dialog is so bad it is cringe worthy. When watching just one scene of Anakin trying to woo Padme with his awful romantic cliché dialog, I feel so embarrassed to be watching the film I want to shut it off.Everyone in this film is pretty boring when it comes to acting, with the exception of Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid. Christensen is at his worst here, being completely wooden, even when he admits he killed the Tusken Raiders, it sounds more like he is apologizing for dropping one of their dishes and not killing a bunch of Tusken Raiders. Natalie Portman also under does her acting in this, with her saying, 'Look,' to announce rescue sounds more like she is pointing out a car window at a deer grazing by the side of the road.With a poor mix of tones, bad characters, a story that leaves me asking questions, and with terrible and cliché romance elements, I am left to view this as the worst movie in the 'Star Wars' saga.",3,1,3,1 August 2013
21 Jump Street," Adam Sandler could have done this better
","What do the movies 'Jack and Jill' and 'Batman and Robin' have in common? Two things. One, they are both considered to be some of the worst films to ever plague cinema. Two, they are both better than '21 Jump Street'. '21 Jump Street' is a comedy film loosely based around a TV show running from the late 80s to the early 90s. While the TV show had heart and thought put into it, the film version disregards the original to throw in as much juvenile humor, stupid characters, unfunny jokes, and desperate attempts at comedy it has. The film starts off with our two main characters in high school. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) is an awkward nerd while Jenko (Channing Tatum) is a jock who picks on Schmidt. Cut to a few years later where both of them are in the police academy and discover that their weaknesses are the other one's strength. A relationship forms between the two based around the fact that the two are using each other and we skip past the building of their friendship in a montage of Schmidt helping Jenko in the academic field while Jenko helps Schmidt in the physical field. The montage brings us to their graduation where they are welcomed into the police force and they are now good friends because of events we never witness. They are placed on park patrol and come across a group of drug dealers. They capture one of them but due to incompetence, the police have to let the dealer go and Schmidt and Jenko are reassigned to an old police program located at 21 Jump Street.At 21 Jump Street, the two meet Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) who reveals to them that they have been chosen because of their youthful appearance, and from what earlier scenes tell the audience because they are incompetent. The duo are sent into a high school to investigate a drug ring where they get their identities mixed up and have to go to the other one's classes. Schmidt is put into a drama class where he meets a girl named Molly (Brie Larson) and later becomes friends with a popular kid named Eric (Dave Franco). As the mission continues, Schmidt becomes more interested in being popular and being in high school than he does on cracking down on the drug dealers, which in turn causes a split between him and Jenko.The characters of Schmidt and Jenko are the overall largest problem with the movie. They are unfunny, unlikable, and they are incompetent. All we know about their relationship is the fact that they became friends based around the fact that they were using each other, then we see a montage of them working together, and then they are suddenly best friends. To add insult to injury, there is no chemistry between the two. A problem with their characters is their arcs exist for lame jokes and that they make them look even more incompetent. Schmidt having trouble firing a weapon is a little acceptable but Jenko's inability to remember his Miranda Rights makes him look dumber and makes the police force look stupid to allow someone like that to stay on the force. I thought that at the end of the movie they would learn a few things and mature. What does the film do instead? Throw out a perfect opportunity for real and interesting character development in place for a stupid, unfunny, and disgusting penis joke.The humor in this movie is at the lowest form of comedy and it is all desperate. Ellie Kemper, who is funny on 'The Office' as Erin, portrayed Jenko's chemistry teacher and was only around for a cheap joke about how she was attracted to Jenko who was supposedly a student. One thing that really bugs me is that some of the comedic moments in this movie are things I would normally find funny, but this film takes what I like and turns it into another annoyance for me. Unfunny and just plain desperate for laughs, '21 Jump Street' sinks to use some of the most juvenile humor I have ever witnessed. How come Adam Sandler and his movies are criticized for having juvenile humor but then this movie gets appraise from critics and the general audience?Of all the movies I have seen, this is the one that I regret watching the most. Watching this film was a depressing and aggravating experience that did nothing but make me lose trust in my friend's opinions who suggested this movie to me. Horrible, unfunny, unlikable, stupid, and obnoxious characters, a story that makes the audience route for incompetence, completed with an overall horrible script and unfunny jokes, '21 Jump Street' is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and it does nothing but causes me anger. While the late and great Roger Ebert said this about another movie, it applies to me here, 'I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it.' (Roger Ebert, 'North' review). There are not enough negative words in the world to describe what this piece of garbage is.",1,11,20,5 October 2013
Captain America: The First Avenger," Middle of the road
","Before the Marvel film 'The Avengers' came out in 2012, there had been buildup for the movie for the past several years. In Marvel's numerous cinematic releases during that time, the films were used to introduce the heroes who would be in 'The Avengers' and to give the audience little glimpses and Easter eggs of what was coming. 'Captain America: The First Avenger' was the forth Marvel movie, the third one used to set up a character, since the release of 'Iron Man' in 2008 to get people ready for the film that everything was building up to.This may sound strange, but this is the first superhero movie I've ever seen where I did not really know what to think of it. 'Captain America' The First Avenger' was not a great superhero movie like 'X2', but it was not terrible like 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. It rested somewhere in the middle of the two films. For every positive, there was a negative and so on and so on. This film is the perfect example of a movie that is in the middle of the road.The Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) discovers the Tesseract around the same time that America has entered into World War II and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a skinny weakling is rejected from the military due to being deemed unfit. Steve is given a chance to be in the military because of a secret project overseen by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci). There, he meets Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), and the father of Tony Stark, Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper). After Steve is turned into Captain America, he is used mainly to boost morale, going from location to location giving shows for the troops. Cap learns that his friend James 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and a number of other soldiers went missing in action, Cap goes to rescue all of them, proving his worthy to the military as a soldier.As I said earlier, for every pro that the movie has there is an equal con. Chris Evan's Captain America is a fun character to watch and get invested in, while Hugo Weaving's Red Skull is a comical, generic villain with nothing interesting to his character. Some of the characters are very bland and forgettable like Atwell's Peggy Carter, or have no character but are only interesting because of their actor or actress such as Jones' Colonel Phillips, while others like Stan's Bucky and Tucci's Erskine are interesting and fun to watch and you get invested in them. The effects, editing, and story both have equal amounts of pros and cons to them. When it all comes down to it, the movie is not terrible, just unmemorable and kind of bland. It has some good elements to it, some interesting characters, and some good effects, but for each of these positives is an equal negative.",4,2,4,23 March 2014
The Revenant," Defeated by ambivalence
","'The Revenant' is a movie that did so much correctly. Thanks to the superb work of director Alejandro Inarritu and the cast and crew, the movie is full of flawless cinematography, sound editing, acting, directing, and visuals. The characters are not interchangeable and all of their motivations make sense. By all accounts, this should be a great movie. There is, however, something weighing it down.After being mauled by a bear, frontier man Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) is left under the care of three others while the rest of his team makes it back to their fort. One member of the team, Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) kills Glass' son, Hawk (Forrest Goodluck), and leaves Glass for dead, fleeing back to the fort. Hellbent on revenge, Glass travels across the dangerous wilderness back towards the fort to find Fitzgerald.Glass' motivation for wanting revenge makes sense: Fitzgerald killed his son and left him for dead, though Glass seems to not care as much about the being left for dead part. The problem is that the entire situation just makes you ambivalent to Glass' struggle. Fitzgerald only killed Hawk after he was making noise and Fitzgerald couldn't get him to quiet down. He was also in the middle of dangerous territory and bringing the wounded Glass along was most likely suicide. He is clearly a bad person, but based on the circumstances, his clear life picture, and the time period that the movie takes place in, it can be viewed as less evil and more of survival instinct. As you can make these defenses to Fitzgerald, when Glass goes after him, your only reason to actually care is because Glass is the protagonist. I personally found myself not caring if Glass got his revenge or not. Since the lust for revenge is what pilots the movie, it ends up feeling long and boring because you can't connect with any of the characters.'The Revenant' has a lot of flawless qualities to it. Getting you to care about the story is not one of them.",6,3,8,27 January 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Surpasses not only its predecessor, but most action movies in general
","In 1984, director James Cameron released his sci-fi action film 'The Terminator' which was met with high praise. Seven years later, Cameron released 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' which surpassed the original, which is also a very good movie, by far. It is a masterpiece of sci-fi, action, and drama that is still one of the best action movies to this day.The film starts off similar to the original. Two different beings are sent from the future, one a terminator and the other a protector. This time around, The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the protector while a new terminator unit, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) is sent back in time to terminate John Connor, the future commander of the human resistance. I know this is a little off topic, but one thing I have to say I love about the opening is the irony that it contains. The hero (Schwarzenegger) is dressed like a punk biker while the villain (Patrick) is dressed as a police officer.While the Terminator is sent to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong), the T-1000 is sent to kill him. We see that John has been placed under the care of some foster parents (Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley) and his mother, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), is in a psychiatric hospital. After the Terminator rescues John, they get Sarah and join forces to keep John alive from the T-1000.Unlike in most action movies where the characters are turned down for flashy effects and over the top fight sequences, this film manages to keep a balance between the action and the characters. There are a lot of tense and amazing action sequences in the movie, but the characters come first. The relationship between the Terminator and John is well written and there is some believable chemistry between the two. The same goes for the relationship between John and Sarah. While in the first movie it was more about the Terminator hunting for Sarah and Reese (Michael Biehn) protecting her, in 'Terminator 2' the audience is shown what will eventually cause the machines to take over, which adds some depth to the story and to Sarah's character when we see her try to kill the person who is accidentally responsible (Joe Morton).Like any good action movie, the action sequences are intense and well shot. We can see what is going on and they do not feel tedious or over- the-top. Complete with shoot outs, explosions, car chases and crashes, 'Terminator 2' checks off all the marks in the action department.'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' is a movie that is packed wall-to-wall with action, but does not forget about its characters or story in the midst of it all. There are compelling characters with interesting relationships between them, cool action sequences, and an interesting story. 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' is a perfect example of how to make an action movie the right way.",10,1,3,1 January 2014
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Please End Now
","It might just be because I watched the Redux version, and from what Ive read the some of the stuff that I found to be the most detrimental were some of the parts added, so my opinion could be different based on seeing the original release, but I doubt that.The issue is that there is a lack of anything to look to over the course of the film. The actual plot line is minimal and the movie just feels like a set of scenes that occur between the first act and the third act when the actual plot takes place. The main character, played by Martin Sheen, isn't very interesting, nor is Marlon Brando's antagonist. There are a number of themes portrayed in the movie, such as the madness of war, but that through line is weak and not enough to carry the second act of the movie on. Instead, it leads to a couple of good scenes here and there, such as the USO Show, but it ultimately doesn't elevate the film's quality.Other than some colorful side characters like the four members of the boat crew (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms, Fredric Forrest, and Albert Hall) and Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall), the movie is dull and vacant.",5,2,9,12 January 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," What a letdown
","Spider-Man is arguably the most well known superhero from Marvel comics and, let alone one of the most well known superheroes in general. In 2002, director Sam Raimi released his film about the superhero to general acclaim. In 2004, 'Spider-Man 2' was released, once again receiving much praise and being called better than the original. When 'Spider-Man 3' was released in 2007, the film received mixed reviews at best and ended the trilogy on a low note. Five years later, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' was released as a reboot of the superhero's origin story, this time directed by Marc Webb and, like the first two films of the Raimi trilogy, received high appraise.The plot of this film is a lot like the plot of the first Raimi movie. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is bitten by a spider and gets spider- like powers from it. After Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) is killed by a thief (Leif Gantvoort), Peter decides to use his powers to fight crime, though it takes a little more time to get to that point in this film than in the Raimi film. As a superhero origin story, it is nothing too special, but it works. The problem is that all of the trailers for this movie promised it being the untold story, which we never see. It is set up right at the beginning of the film and then forgotten about.The biggest problem that weighs the film down comes from none other than our main protagonist Peter Parker. I have not seen Andrew Garfield in anything else, but I have a feeling he is a good actor who is simply in the wrong role. His performance of Peter Parker is frankly boring, but the worst parts about the character come not from his portrayal, but how he is written. In this film, Peter Parker is a hundred different things rolled into one character who is barley consistent and ends up coming off as unlikable most of the time. I would even say that this is the worst superhero ever put in a movie. Sure, George Clooney in 'Batman & Robin' was bad, but his character was at the very least consistent.The other characters in the film are also bland, uninteresting cardboard cutouts with the exception of Captain Stacey (Denis Leary) and, only because of his actor, Dr. Kurt Connors (Rhys Ifans). This movie has a lot of talented actors and actresses in it, but the characters are so poorly written and with the editing taking out important moments involving them that these characters are as ridiculous and cliché as the Lizard's plan. With the poor writing comes the poor chemistry between Peter and Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone), whose relationship exists mainly because Spider-Man needs a love interest. I will say the relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) from the Raimi 'Spider-Man' was not all that interesting, but it actually did something with the characters and was not just to give Peter a romantic interest.When it comes to superhero movies, this one also has one of the most ridiculous endings. In other superhero films that take themselves less seriously and realize they are goofy and corny an ending like this would work, but 'The Amazing Spider-Man' shows itself off as a serious and realistic superhero movie like the Christopher Nolan 'Batman' movies. With the Nolan movies, the serious take on the story worked, but here, it does not. The villain is a giant lizard and his evil plan is to turn the rest of the city into lizards using a device that Oscorp created. Spider-Man saves the day with the help of a bunch of construction workers turning their cranes so he can easily swing over to Oscorp tower. 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is a film that promises the audience a lot of things which never pay off. It is not the untold story, and the serious approach makes all of the goofy things stand out as major problems for the film. Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is one of the worst superheroes to ever appear on screen, and this is the worst Marvel movie I have ever seen. Boring, cardboard cutouts of characters, a story that takes itself too seriously, a comical, clichéd ending, and by just not keeping its promises, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is, in simplest terms, a letdown of a movie.",3,3,5,14 March 2014
Jackie," Completely Scatterbrained
","'Jackie' is one of, if not the most scatterbrained movie I have ever watched in my life. It is so incoherently put together and flawed in almost every department of its making that I'm convinced the person who made this might not have even a rudimentary understanding of filmmaking.The movie focuses on Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) mere days after her husband's assassination as she explains what happened over the following days to a reporter (Billy Crudup).Almost everything about this movie is off and fundamentally flawed. The cinematography is obviously trying to be stylistic, but it does not fit and makes some scenes look downright atrocious. The editing in this movie is awful. The sound editing does not blend well with the movie, and a number of scenes are edited to have jump cuts that negatively affect the scene. Natalie Portman's acting is better than it has been in other roles, but she is still not believable, and she can't pull off Jackie Kennedy's accent. The story is about an interesting and iconic individual, and is based completely around her planning her husband's funeral. The movie is told non chronologically, but the order of the scenes and how flashbacks are set up really don't have much correlation with one another and were just arbitrarily placed throughout the movie's story line.The only good things I can really say about the movie is that the writing was decent, it included a few interesting details about Jackie Kennedy and the events following JFK's assassination, and there was great attention to the film's aesthetics.",3,2,5,7 February 2017
Tropic Thunder," Good Idea Done Badly
","There are definitely better movies out there that I hate more than 'Tropic Thunder,' and using the word hate is definitely too strong a word to describe my feelings, but I have to say it failed for me in almost every way.I loved the idea behind the movie: a bunch of actors accidentally end up in a situation that mirrors their Vietnam War drama, but while the plot is funny the execution of it isn't. The story gets propelled forward by a number of coincidences that aren't comedic in any way, and would alert any of the main characters that something strange was going on. The only character who realizes there's something wrong is Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), but he still ventures out into the jungle with the rest of the cast. There's also not enough humor fired at the parallels between the movie the actors are making and the movie the audience is watching.There are some funny things in the movie, however. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific in his role and has some good back and forth with Brandon T. Jackson, and there's some genuinely funny stuff from every member of the cast, but most of the jokes were misses for me. There are a number of references to other Vietnam War films like Oliver Stone's 'Platoon,' or the usage of the same songs all of these Vietnam War films have like 'For What It's Worth' by Buffalo Springfield, but they're just references without anything comedic behind it. It's literally just the movie saying, 'Hey audience, do you recognize this?'In short, 'Tropic Thunder' is a lot of good ideas poorly executed. The cast is all funny at points, and Jack Black is the only one who is annoying, and the characters are all different, but the humor is not very funny and the poor story line shines above everything else.",2,4,12,11 May 2017
Inside Out," Disappointing
","After seeing the trailer for 'Inside Out', I was pretty keen to see it. The movie looked like it had a lot of good ideas and all of the people working on the project who I knew about I like. This should have been a great movie experience for me, but instead, it was a disappointment.After moving from Minnesota to San Francisco, eleven-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) has to adjust to a new life with the help of her emotions, Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). When Joy and Sadness are accidentally purged from the control tower along with Riley's core memories, which make Riley Riley, the two have to find their way back. As Joy and Sadness try to do that, Fear, Anger, and Disgust are the only emotions Riley has left to control her.In their journeys through Riley's brain back to headquarters, Joy and Sadness come across Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), who helps them find their way through Riley's brain. Bing Bong was not introduced at any point before his reveal, so he just shows up out of nowhere without any buildup or previous mention. Then, he becomes one of the most important characters of the whole movie.When it comes to the characters, most of them are understandably defined to one personality trait (happy, sad, scared, angry, etc.), but even the characters that aren't emotions don't have much personality to them. Riley has (as stated by the movie) five things that make her who she is, and the only one that really adds any personality is goof ball. Her parents (Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) are blank slates, their emotions are blank slates who somehow don't even show their one emotion, and even Bing Bong lacks any real personality. Along with that, Joy's character arc makes little sense. She learns of Sadness's importance to Riley, but for all we know, Sadness has only done one thing right that helped Riley while Joy and the other three emotions controlling her seemed to be working for the most part. There was no lesson that really needed to be learned from the get-go of the story, because Sadness was only needed to solve the problem that she started in the first place.The story elements are a lot of the same things over and over again. Joy, Sadness, and Bing Bong try to get to the control center, but each time, their method of getting their is destroyed by the accidentally and unknowingly by an emotion or an exterior event, like Riley sleeping or the brain workers outside of abstract thought. Then, they have to try and find a way to start everything up again or find a new way to Riley's brain. It just goes on like that for an hour and thirty minutes.Granted, there were some creative elements to the movie and some genuinely funny and emotional moments, but they were overshadowed by the larger problems the movie had. I'd say this is the worst Pixar movie I have seen, even worse than 'Cars', and a great disappointment.",4,107,243,19 June 2015
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4 offers nothing new and in a poor way
","The quality of PIXAR productions has been down ever since 'Wall-E' and the 'Toy Story' franchise is already limited in what it can do, so, in hindsight, this movie's lackluster existence shouldn't be unexpected.'Toy Story' is limited in what it can do, because what all really can toys do other than get lost and try to get back to their owner? Throw on the usual themes of children growing up and things changing and voila, you have a 'Toy Story' movie. These ideas are all fine, but this is the fourth film in the series and thus the fourth time they've done this. It's all recycled material which results in the film feeling tedious.What is different this time is the movie's focus on Woody and Bo Peep's relationship. Every other original and fan-favorite character is tossed to the side to follow a story involving one of the least interesting aspects of the 'Toy Story' series. A new group of characters takes their place as the side characters, and they either don't stand out are really annoying.Now that the formulaic themes and story is in place and the annoying characters are all set to go, 'Toy Story 4' just heaps them all together in a forced and poorly written plot.'Toy Story' handles the theme of replacement better than 'Toy Story 4' does. 'Toy Story 2' handles the theme of change better than 'Toy Story 4' does. 'Toy Story 3' is a better and more satisfying climax to the series than 'Toy Story 4' is. Just remember those films and you've essentially seen all 'Toy Story 4' has to offer, but much better",4,43,83,24 June 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Does not live up to the first one but it has its strengths
","Considered one of Steven Spielberg's worst films, 'Jurassic Park: The Lost World' is also considered to be the worst film in the 'Jurassic Park' trilogy. While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the 'Jurassic Park' franchise.'Jurassic Park' is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like 'Aliens' or 'Platoon', but 'The Lost World' does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people.With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of 'Jurassic Park' and 'The Lost World' and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in 'Jurassic Park III'. Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do.Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the 'Jurassic Park' trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.",8,12,17,16 August 2013
The Little Mermaid," The first half is good, the second half is great
","'The Little Mermaid' is said to have kicked off a period for Disney known as the Disney Renaissance period, starting with this movie and ending with 'Tarzan' a decade later. It is also said to be the first movie of the Disney Renaissance that started the incline of good movies before dropping with the release of 'Pocahontas'. I agree with the point that there was a decade long span of a Disney Renaissance period, but I have a little bit of a different view on this movie being one of the greats. While the last half of the movie is definitely deserving of that level of praise, the first half, while good, is not as well done, in my opinion.After missing her father's celebration because she was searching a sunken human ship looking for artifacts, Ariel (Jodi Benson) is warned by her father King Triton (Kenneth Mars) end her interest with the human world. Ariel does not listen and ends up saving a human, Prince Eric (Christopher Daniel Barnes) from drowning after his ship catches fire and sinks. Triton forbids Ariel from going to the surface again, resulting in her making a deal with the sea witch Ursula (Pat Carroll) to become human for three days and to have a kiss of true love in exchange for Ariel's voice. If Ariel fails, Ursula will claim her.While the first half of the film with Ariel's life underwater is good, it is not very original. Ariel wants to do something but everyone else tells her it's a bad idea. The only refreshing thing done with this is that Ariel comes off less as a cliché breaking traditions kind of character and instead like a teenage girl who just isn't listening to her father all the time. The part where Ariel and Eric first meet and fall in love is the most rushed romance of any Disney film. He just hears her voice and sees her and he's in love. She just sees him and she's in love. I know it's Disney, but even by their standards it is rushed and unbelievable. The second half of the film is handled much better. When Ariel is unable to speak, a lot has to be conveyed in her facial expression and actions, which is always nice to see. The fish-out-of-water element (no pun intended) also really works here because it is not just that she has come from a different world, but that she has been given the wrong information on certain things in the human world, like forks and pipes, which allows for some good comedy. The thing that really makes the movie shine, in my opinion, are the side characters, who are for the most part very memorable. King Triton comes off like a father who is worried about his daughter's well-being. Sebastian (Samuel E. Wright) is the first Disney character, I think, to actually have some sort of background with music that he uses at different points in the movie. Flounder (Jason Marin) serves as the timid, but still helpful friend to Ariel, and Scuttle (Buddy Hackett) works as the comic relief who thinks he understands things better than he really does. Ursula is a villain who, while what she's doing is evil, actually has some right to do certain things because of Ariel's contract, so she is not just evil. The same, however, can not be said about Prince Eric, who is pretty forgettable.The animation of the film is spectacular, though the animation sometimes does not meet up with the voice work. The musical numbers aren't very memorable, with the exception of Sebastian's 'Under the Sea' and 'Kiss the Girl'. While tiny, something that bothered me is that while all of the sea creatures talked, Eric's dog Max didn't.As I said, the first half of the film is good, but I don't view it as great, though the second half is. I can see why it is said that this film started the Disney Renaissance period, but I don't think that 'The Little Mermaid' is as good and deserves to be mentioned with the movies people label as the greats, namely 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Aladdin', and 'The Lion King'.",8,0,0,23 August 2014
Avengers: Infinity War," 'Avengers: Infinity War' is dishonest, idiotic, and simply awful in almost every aspect of its handling.
","While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down 'Infinity War.'It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as 'Black Panther' and 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' and some I have despised, such as 'Iron Man 2' and 'The Avengers.' 'Infinity War' could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with 'Avengers: Infinity War.' Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from 'Thor: Ragnarok' on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.Character stupidity is at an all time high in 'Avengers: Infinity War,' and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population.Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.The two things that 'Infinity War' did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.'Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.'Infinity War,' to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.",1,641,1619,1 May 2018
Gone Girl," Quite possibly Fincher's best
","'Gone Girl' is director David Fincher's tenth movie and his fifth that I've seen and dare I say it might be Fincher's best film. The movie is not just an intricate mystery thriller film, but it has interesting, realistic characters, a well thought-out story, and a well done undertone theme about public perception.The best part of the film are the characters of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) Dunne. Amy has faked her death and left an awful story behind that paints Nick as a villain. What did Nick do? In most films, Nick would have been an innocent guy who was just with a crazy girl, but not this movie. While a lot of the stuff Amy said about Nick was a lie, he was cheating on her, which set off her intricate revenge plot. The movie is not asking you to like or even sympathize with one or the other. It's just asking you to understand them. Nick started to have an affair after he felt like he and Amy weren't working out, which led Amy to her revenge scheme.The movie's thematic undertone dealing with public perception had two different levels to it, one level being in terms of the movie and the other being in terms of the cast. The movie is about the disappearance of Amy Dunne and the investigation that ensues. During this time, Amy, who's undeniably in the wrong, is painted off as America's sweetheart while her husband Nick, who did do something wrong but doesn't deserve what's happening to him, is turned into the most hated man in the country. But wait, it goes farther than that. At one point, a journalist asks Nick to smile for a picture, which he does so and immediately earns backlash for it. Then, when the girl (Emily Ratajkowski) he's cheating on Amy with comes forward, she dresses, as Amy puts it, like a babysitter, to look as innocent as possible.The idea of public perception and not knowing the full truth is done so even with the cast. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry, who both do great jobs in the movie, are more well known for comedic work and, this being a serious drama, you'd think they wouldn't be cut out for it. Then, we have Rosamund Pike, who gives the best performance in the whole movie, who is a fairly unknown actress so we don't know what to expect from her. Then, there's Ben Affleck, who is an actor that for reasons I don't understand, people hate. So, there's an actor people seem to really hate being a victim, an actress we know nothing about that the audience figures out what to think about her as the movie progresses, and then there'r Harris and Perry, who are comedians in a drama. All of these people have public perceptions of them that are challenged by this movie.'Gone Girl' is just another movie that proves David Fincher is a fantastic and talented filmmaker. The movie does not become a jumbled mess even with all of the twists and turns in the script, the acting is all really good, the characters are interesting, and the public perception angle is handled superbly. If you haven't seen it, I would strongly advise you to check out 'Gone Girl' immediately.",10,1,7,18 March 2015
2012," A disaster with every element
","Isn't it poetic? A disaster film is itself a disaster. '2012' is another end of the world/destruction movie that Roland Emerich has become infamous for. Even though his films before were not that great, they did not feel like they had to be force fed to the audience like this film did.While it has amazing visuals of an earthquake breaking up Los Angeles and several thousand foot tidal waves that toss around Air Force One and the U.S.S John F. Kennedy, the disaster is also with the characters and the story.The characters are laughably one dimensional and boring. The expression of the family is the same as ours when Gordon or anyone else dies. We're left sitting there going, 'Okay, he's dead. No big deal.' They expect us to be sad for characters that were more of semi-antagonistic characters and to just be okay over the death of a character we have spent the whole time watching.The story is nothing more than a coincidence after a coincidence. Yes, other films have coincidences in them to move the plot along like C-3PO and R2-D2 being picked by the Lars Family in 'Star Wars', but coincidence is the whole reason for the family's survival. They get a plane and Gordon is luckily a pilot. They fly to Las Vegas where they meet up with our main protagonist Jackson's boss Yuri who will not bring them with until he finds out he needs a second pilot so he has to pick Gordon. They are going to crash land but the earth shifts several thousand miles so they crash right by where the arks are being built and run luckily find a family whose son is on the arc who decide to pick them up. Then, Jackson can luckily hold his breath for ten minutes to dislodge an object that got stuck in the ark's door gear which was preventing the ark from turning on.The acting is awful as well. Not much else to say with acting but on another note, there is no tension in the film. The escape from Los Angeles basically destroys that because we see how invincible the family is. The second they pull out of their driveway, the earthquake is right behind them and there is not one second where they almost fall into the cracks. The second they leave the road to get around a car with stereotypical slow old ladies driving, the road in front of them falls apart. They manage to dodge a bunch of falling cars and get through a collapsing building with it barely scraping the roof of their car. The closest thing to tension that there is is the plane losing the landing gear in Vegas and then them crash landing because for one second, you think the plane might survive. At least there was about forty-five seconds of tension in the film about the all out destruction of earth.To add insult to injury, one of the worst lines in cinema history is uttered right at the end of the film.",1,2,4,6 August 2013
X-Men: The Last Stand," A guilty pleasure that is a mess of a film
","In the year 2000, director Bryan Singer brought the Marvel superhero team the X-Men to the big screen with his film 'X-Men'. Later, in 2003, Singer worked as the director of the sequel, 'X2: X-Men United', in my opinion the best Marvel film and one of the best superhero films to date. When the third chapter to the X-Men film trilogy was in the works, negotiations made Singer decide to sign on to the Superman reboot, 'Superman Returns', and it does show. Was this film as good as the first two X-Men movies? No. Is it what you would normally expect from a third film in a trilogy of movies. Probably.I first saw this movie with a friend when it came out in 2006 and did not think much of it. A few years later, I rented the movie and re- watched it with a mostly positive look on it. As time passed, I realized while I liked the movie, it was at best a guilty pleasure and at worse a mess of a final movie for a trilogy. It is quite sad as there was actually some good substance in the movie, but it gets bogged down with pointless characters, multiple story lines, and having more of an interest in showing action sequences than telling a good story.Taking place once again in the 'not too distant future', a businessman (Michael Murphy) has created a cure that will rid mutants of their powers. The mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen) begins to recruit other mutants to fight against the cure. At the same time, an emotionally damaged Cyclops (James Marsden) begins to hear Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and returns to Alkali Lake where he finds her alive and well. It is revealed that Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) had to mentally block out part of Jean's brain to keep her powers in check and her alternate side is now the one in power.This film suffers the most from having too many characters being introduced and subplots going on at the same time. In the opening of the movie, a flashback is present of the mutant Angel (Ben Foster/Cayden Boyd) whose only importance to the movie is that his father is the businessman who created the cure and is in a total of about six scenes. From the previous films, Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) are upgraded from just doing cameos to being on the team for the sole purpose of having more X-Men to fight. Kitty, along with Beast (Kelsey Grammar) are the only two new characters that actually have something to do in the movie rather than just be there to add people to the epic final battle.The most surprising and refreshing aspect of the film was the plot line about the cure for the mutants. The film never goes explicitly into whether it is right or wrong and is just letting the characters decide for themselves. All of the characters that is except for Storm (Halle Berry) who is supporting of other mutants choices in other films but is suddenly very opinionated and reacts harshly towards it.While there is some substance to the movie, it is covered up by all of the pointless characters, plot lines that do not add up to much, and action scenes. The acting for the most part was good and the preexisting characters were still interesting, but the story and the new characters weighed it all down. The mutant's powers were used whenever they could be and not when it would be appropriate, with the exception being at the end and when they are at Jean's home in the middle of the movie. The film is not as bad as people make it out to be, but at its best it is a guilty pleasure.",2,0,0,5 March 2014
22 Jump Street," Better than the first though that isn't saying much
","I swear, sometimes I'm too optimistic. Even though '21 Jump Street' is one of my least favorite movies and one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I felt obligated to see '22 Jump Street' and went through with it because I thought this time around they may of had something. While '22 Jump Street' is better than '21 Jump Street', though that isn't hard for any movie to do, it still suffers from the same problems as the first and has some elements to it that even surpasses '21 Jump Street' in awfulness.Starting off with Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) once again screwing up a police mission, they somehow get to keep their jobs and are just put back onto Jump Street, now moved across the street in a different abandoned church. Schmidt and Jenko are given the relatively same assignment as they had in the last film except this time they're going to college because they look too old for high school, which raises the question why they're working for a police group that goes undercover as students when everyone can see that they aren't students.'22 Jump Street' does a lot of the same stuff that its predecessor did, especially the use of self-awareness as a mode of self-preservation. Just because a movie is unneeded and pointless but is aware of it does not make it any less unneeded and pointless. A movie like 'Scream' is self-aware, but it uses that self-awareness to try and make it stand out while '22 Jump Street' makes light of the fact that they're doing the whole thing over again without adding anything new to it. It's fine if a movie is self-aware, but '22 Jump Street' does not use it to its full advantage and just uses it as a tool so people can't criticize the movie because it's self-aware.Once again, Schmidt and Jenko share zero chemistry together, despite the fact they helped each other through the police academy, went through the high school mission together and supposedly came out stronger, and now have been partners for a while. Not only do these two not show any chemistry, their relationship is easily showed up by Jenko's friendship with Zook (Wyatt Russell). I do not remember a single memorable moment between Schmidt and Jenko alone. This time around, Jenko is the one having fun and getting caught up in the whole school experience while Schmidt is the outcast who we're supposed to feel sorry for. Unfortunately, this backfires as Jenko makes attempts to keep their duo together and Schmidt just can't keep up while at the same time Jenko is trying to move on and Schmidt is holding him back. Why am I supposed to want these two to be partners when it's so evident one is holding the other back and they share zero chemistry?To the movie's credit, there were three mildly amusing parts to it. One of which involves Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) finding out that Schmidt and his daughter (Amber Stevens) hooked up, Jenko finding out and then running around telling everyone at Jump Street what happened, and the first part of the ending credits with Schmidt and Jenko in med school. Aside from those three parts, the movie is made up of the same desperate attempts at comedy that the first film had.With the same problems as the first film but with three mildly amusing comedy scenes, '22 Jump Street' is better than '21 Jump Street' in the most superficial terms, but better nonetheless. Though, when you're a sequel to '21 Jump Street', expectations are on the ground so there is no way to go but up.",1,50,111,24 June 2014
Moulin Rouge!," The term 'style over substance' was invented for this movie
","'Moulin Rouge!' is a film filled with glorious sets, vibrant colors, well choreographed dance and music sequences, memorable costumes, and an active atmosphere. Unfortunately, the same care that goes into the style of the film does not go into the romance or the plot. It can be fun to look at, but it is not fun when you are actually looking for something beyond the look of the film.The scenes are rich and festive, filled with a lot of eye candy and glamorous colors to get your attention. A problem with this is that the film is shot so quickly that you do not have time to admire the visuals and are instead assaulted with quick shot after quick shot of them that does not allow you to take it all in.The movie is more interested in showing off its visuals than it is at giving the audience a story that the visuals can all fall back on. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is our run-of-the-line tragic poet who came to Paris against his father's wishes and believes strongly in things like love. After one brief meeting with the Moulin Rouge's star, a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman), Christian is in love. While at first she is not in love with Christian, singing a few parts from present day songs a few scenes later makes her realize she is in love. Unfortunately for the two, Satine must sleep with the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) if she is to get out of the Moulin Rouge and become a real star. These events gives off one of the most clichéd love triangles of film history.By the end of the film, the plot of 'Moulin Rouge' has gotten more out of hand than its visuals. The love triangle gets out of hand with nonsensical character motivations and the characters acting dumb. Christian and Satine plan to run off together because the Duke will not allow them to be together, but once she discovers she's dying they can't run off together for some reason. Before that happens, a background character with no reason to not want Christian and Satine together reveals their relationship to the Duke and torments Christian over the fact that Satine has to be with the Duke. By the end, the characters are out of this world, acting stupid, insane, or having sudden random motivations that make no sense.'Moulin Rouge' is an assault on your eyes and ears, bombarding you with non-stop visuals and loud noises with very few quiet breaks in between to let what you've just watched sink in. The term 'style over substance' was invented for this movie.",3,3,3,2 January 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Another letdown from 'Spider-Man'
","I remember after watching 'The Amazing Spider-Man' almost two years ago for the first and only time that I hoped the next film in the series would be better. My hopes came true as 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is a little better than its predecessor. After watching the film though, I realized that almost two years ago, I should have hoped the next movie would be good. 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is a sequel that learned from the mistakes made the first time, but only corrected a few of those mistakes.Opening up on a heist conducted by a group of criminals, our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) gives chase and foils the heist in an upbeat scene that suggests the people behind the movie decided to smartly move away from the darker tone a la Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight trilogy'. Spider-Man manages to get to his graduation just in time and ends up breaking up with his girlfriend Gwen (Emma Stone) because he is seeing her deceased father (Denis Leary), whom he promised in the first film that he would keep Gwen out of harm, which he has fluctuated on but this time he is certain with it.In the meantime, an obsessed fan of Spider-man's who was saved during the heist at the beginning of the movie (Jamie Foxx) is believed dead in an accident that ends up giving him the power to harness electricity. As this happens, Peter's old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns to Manhattan, dying from something known as the Osborn curse, and requires Spider-man's blood and its healing capabilities to save his life. If 'The Amazing Spider-Man' was the Raimi 'Spider-Man' to this new franchise, than 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' would be the 'Spider-Man 3' of the new franchise. The film attempts to balance too many story arcs, one dealing with Peter's parents, one dealing with the Peter/Gwen relationship, one for each of the villains, and so on. Each plot is brought up, then something comes up to distract from that plot line to follow another plot line just to pick up the dropped plot line ten to twenty minutes later (you able to follow that?). The film adds more humor that is suitable for a 'Spider-Man' film in this one with the darker scenes at the end, but the film is less humorous like like 'Iron Man 3' and more along the lines of stupid and goofy like 'Spider-Man 3'. Toning down the darker, more realistic tone of the movie was a good move though, because it makes the presence of an electric man that was turned that way by falling into a tank of electric eels more suitable for the world that is being created.Like 'The Amazing Spider-Man', this film is just set up for the next movie. It ends in a similar fashion, this time with Harry Osborn instead of Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) being met by a man in the shadows (Michael Massee). This time around, Osborn and the man plan to join a number of villains together to defeat Spider-Man, the first being the stereotypical Russian mobster from the opening heist (Paul Giamatti), now being called Rhinoceros. Several of the plot lines including the one about the parents had a loose end to it for the next movie, but at least this time we got to know about them. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone return in their roles as Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey, sharing a little chemistry this time around, but still maintaining the lack of interest from the first film. Garfield's Peter Parker does not fluctuate in character as much in this film, this time not having any definitive character traits other than some snappy on- the-spot joking. The only character who stands out is Foxx's Electro until he becomes another villain who is just out for revenge on the hero.While it is better than 'The Amazing Spider-Man', 'The Amazing Spider- Man 2' is a mess of plot lines that are jumbled up and poorly balanced with one another for the sake of setting up sequels. With a weak, and at times stupid, final scene of the film, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' ends on its lowest point, which is what will most likely stick with you after watching this film.",2,16,35,2 May 2014
Event Horizon," An underrated sci-fi horror flick
","There were two films that 'Event Horizon' reminded me of. The first movie it reminded me of was Ridley Scott's 'Alien' from 1979 where a crew aboard a freighter goes down to a planet, brings back the alien creature, and then has it pick off the crew one by one. The other film I was reminded of was the film 'Sphere' based off a novel by Michael Crichton where a team underwater finds a futuristic spaceship and discovers a sphere on it which allows the people who enter it to create real threats with their thoughts. 'Event Horizon' has the scary, dramatic thrill that 'Alien' had, but also some of the stupidity that 'Sphere' had.In the year 2040, the starship 'Event Horizon' disappeared on its maiden voyage. Seven years later, a distress signal from the ship has been received and the crew of the rescue vessel 'Lewis and Clark', along with Dr. Weir (Sam Neil) who helped build the ship, are sent to investigate it. Upon arriving at the ship, they find the crew all dead, but that there are still life-sign readings. Upon further investigation, it turns out that the ship entered a black hole and emerged, now with something controlling it.Starting off, the crew of the ship is not all that interesting. There is a stereotypical comedic relief character named Cooper (Richard T. Jones), a member of the crew who was whisked away from her son's birthday named Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), and several others. The only two characters in the film who stand out as even remotely interesting are Dr. Weir and Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne). However, with the exception of Cooper, the characters are not annoying blank slates that are just there for cannon fodder and, for the most part, you can at least be mildly worried about what the outcome for the character might be.I really appreciate that in a film like this that was made in the late '90s that they did not resort to CGI to create the ships and used models instead, and that the use of CGI was very restricted. The use of models for the ships reminded me and helped me picture the setting of 'Alien', which I think the film was basing its horror movie in space premise off of. The film was not more interested in showing special effects than it was on telling the story it wanted to tell, which I am glad about. Another notable thing to mention is the design of the 'Event Horizon' is an original spaceship design that I have never seen in any other movie or television show.After the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' look around and investigate the ship, the movie starts to go into the stupidity territory with its plot. The ship used its gravity-drive to enter another universe via a black hole and when it came out, the ship began to screw with its crew, and now the 'Lewis and Clark' crew's minds. I liked the fact that there was not a monster that was on the ship that picked the crew off and it was more of a psychological horror story for the cast, but the idea that the ship is now alive and doing that is ludicrous, even in science-fiction terms. There is not an A.I in the ship's computer that went haywire from the black hole, or the ship is not just stuck in between the two universes, the ship is simply alive and is scaring them.At the end, I became a little fed up with the movie because it did the only thing dumber than having the ship be alive. It brought back Dr. Weir, who beforehand had been sucked into space via an opening in the ship after he was, I have no idea so let's just say infected, by the ship. The ship brings him back, now as a monster to confront Captain Miller. The film does have some stupid moments in it; sometimes really stupid moments, but it also has a genuinely creepy atmosphere and tone to it, and the idea that the crew is being attacked by their thoughts and not some scary space creature is something I enjoyed. While I will not say this is an underrated masterpiece, I will say it is an underrated film that more people should watch.",6,0,2,24 April 2014
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A nightmare that I want to never watch again
","At a mere seventy-six minutes it feels like two hours. 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a stop-motion animated film that has some beautifully flawless animation, creative designs for creatures and locations, and an interesting premise to it, but barely anything happens within the entire running time. The film is filled with uninteresting characters that are more action than motivation, songs that do not convey much, and some parts that are never explained.Starting out in Halloween Town, the festivities of another Halloween end, but for the Pumpkin King Jack Skellington (Chris Sarandon) has grown to be tired of Halloween, and goes walking through the forest. In the forest, he comes across a group of trees with doors designed in the shape of holiday objects on them. Jack goes through the Christmas tree shaped door and ends up in Christmas Town. Jack returns to Halloween Town with his knowledge of Christmas, wanting to make everyone else in town understand it.From this point on, the plot gets too complicated to properly explain because Jack's plans on what to do with his new knowledge of Christmas changes every ten minutes. First, he wants to inform the town about it at a town meeting. Then, he wants to make Christmas happen by kidnapping Santa (Edward Ivory) to keep him out of the way. There is no motivation to back up why Jack is doing any of this, yet he still does it, making him more action than motive. When he brings Christmas to the human world, he brings Halloween instead with terrifying presents, but there is no reason why he should have done this.The musical numbers in this film are some of the most useless parts of the movie, which makes its very short run-time feel long. There are several musical numbers throughout the film, many of them several minutes long, and they barley convey anything. In Jack's song at the beginning of the movie, all we learn is that he is tired of Halloween, but that song runs for at least three minutes. Other songs gives out no information about the characters or is working towards a plot point, it is basically just a pointless musical number that are redundant. The opening song is all of the monsters singing about what they are and how it's Halloween. I'm confused. What are all of these creatures? Just have them each tell me what they are in a few stanzas of a song and then we'll put it all together to make a four minute song. That'll get it across to the audience.How the worlds operate is never explained, nor does it make any sense. It is never stated specifically how the worlds are connected or if the other worlds are even aware of the other worlds existences. Jack apparently has no idea about the other holiday worlds, but the Christmas world knew of the human world. Then, all of the worlds are shown to be connected through some doorways in trees, yet Jack gets from the human world to Halloweentown via an entrance in a graveyard later on. Jack also flew into the sky while in Halloweentown in a sled pulled by skeleton reindeer, which would not fit through any of the doors or into the graveyard entrance, so how did he get to the human world? Even with all of these other problems, the most surprising of them all is how pointless several of the characters are. Sally, as I mentioned above, is supposedly the second most important character in the whole movie after Jack, but she is pointless. All she does is run away from her creator, the Evil Scientist (William Hickey) and have a premonition involving Jack's Christmas. She also has a pointless romance with Jack that literally comes out of nowhere at the end and is pointless to the characters and the story. With Sally being pointless to the story, it also makes the Evil Scientist who made her pointless to have in the film.'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a movie that I'm barely sure of what happened in it. So few things of importance actually happens in the movie, and when they do, there is almost no motivation behind it. Bad musical numbers, pointless characters, action over motive, and set in a world that makes no sense of how it operates, this film is a nightmare that I want to never watch again.",2,8,17,11 July 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," A surprisingly good movie
","Like the 2012 film 'The Avengers', 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a movie that had a lot riding against it and in the hands of a lesser filmmaker, would have failed. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' knows how ridiculous it is and plays with that aspect to make the film work. While primarily a comedy film, the movie still manages to have some serious and sentimental moments in it that do not feel out of place, my guess being that that is attributed to James Gunn's (Super, Slither) directing and writing skills.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), who was abducted from earth as a young boy, has now become a criminal who calls himself Starlord. On a planet, Quill steals the an orb, which serves as the movie's MacGuffin, and escapes from a group of people trying to stop him. Quill refuses to return to his colleague Yondu (Michael Rooker) so they can make money off the orb together, who subsequently places a bounty on Quill's head. When Quill tries to sell the orb, he is met by the resistance of three others, Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) who want to capture Quill for the bounty on his head, and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who wants to take the orb and give it to her buyer. All four are captured and sent to a prison where they encounter Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista). The group learns from Gamora, a former minion of Ronan (Lee Pacer) that Ronan wants the orb to destroy the galaxy, the five criminals band together to escape the prison and get the orb to Gamora's buyer, with Drax wanting to use his freedom as an opportunity to kill Ronan.While other Marvel movies seemed to have a lot of comedy that felt out of place at time or got annoying, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is able to make the comedy work with it. With the ridiculousness of the movie, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' would probably of only worked as a comedy. In the hands of a lesser writer and possibly director, the movie would try to work by pointing out how ridiculous everything in it really is, but instead they made it an actual comedy. Even though it was a comedy, it still managed to have some serious and sentimental moments with investment in the characters. Comedy-wise, this is probably one of the best ways I've seen it used because it is not needlessly funny and it knows just how much to give out.All of the actors in this movie are very good and have good chemistry with one another, even though half of them are computer generated. I usually do not bring up acting unless I am really surprised by it or am just flabbergasted at how bad it is, but I really felt the need to comment with this one. While none of the performances are Academy Award worthy, with a film like this there was a chance that some of the actors would just do as bad a job as possible to see if they could get away with it. All of the actors give as good a performance as they can. Surprisingly, Dave Bautista, the voice of Drax, is very good in the movie because usually having a wrestler acting in a movie hurts it, but Bautista does a very good job.I'd say the one area of the film that lacked was with the villain of Ronan. Other than the fact that he is one of the most powerful beings in the galaxy, there really isn't much to his character and he is kind of a bore. Compared to other Marvel villains like Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Magneto (Ian McKellen/Michael Fassbender), and the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), there isn't anything that really sets him apart as a character. While he is not as badly written as the villains in 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2', they at least had aspects that set them apart. Complete with good characters, a good story, and a mixture of funny and serious moments that don't feel like they contradict each other, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is a surprisingly good movie. In fact, this movie was fun, unlike a lot of comic book movies have recently been.",7,1,5,7 August 2014
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," A lackluster finale
","I have never seen any of the other 'Twilight' movies nor have I read any of the books and went into this without any experience towards the 'Twilight' series. So, looking into it without any thought about the previous stories from this universe, I can say that not only is this a poorly made and written movie, it is a weak and lackluster climax that I can guess even the biggest, most die-hard fans of the 'Twilight' series will agree with me on. The movie is riddled with ridiculous characters with even more ridiculous ideas and motivations, over-the-top and comical acting, poor visual effects, and story points that are sloppily fit together without much thought.I will give the film credit in two areas. One is the unintentionally funny moments. While there are few of these moments, some of them have such over-the-top acting or ridiculous writing that it will almost make you glad you at least saw those scenes from the movie. Next, Bella's father (Billy Burke) and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) are the only characters you can at the least say are decent people and not as stupid as the other characters. When it comes to this movie, the biggest most fatal problem is that this is the final movie in a series. As the final chapter of a story, the events of the film are going to effect the final outcome for the world. In the epic finales of many great movie sagas like 'Star Wars', 'Lord of the Rings', 'The Dark Knight trilogy', and 'Pirates of the Caribbean', everything has led up to the final confrontation between the heroes and the villains and no matter what, things will change. The first problem is with the battle. After an epic battle where several characters, including the main antagonist are killed, it is all revealed to be a look into the future for the villain. To make matters worse, the film does not just use a dream sequence to make the audience think they just witnessed an epic final battle. Another problem that arises with this finale is that none of the characters have to fight or sacrifice anything and everything ends with the good vampires and werewolves going back to their lives.This movie does not work as a finale, nor does it work as a movie. As a stand alone movie, it is sloppy and does tells a story that is torn apart by plot holes, uninteresting characters, and a lack of emotional connection with the audience. As a finale, it lacks the epic climax it was building up to, no sacrifices have to be made, and the final battle, even if it was a dream, was anticlimactic. Even with its funny- bad moments, the film is still not worth the 115 minutes of your life.",2,7,17,16 December 2013
The Descent," I really wanted to like this one
","'The Descent' is a horror movie I really wanted to like. I heard all of this great stuff about it, including many people, average Joes and critics alike calling it one of the best horror movies of the 21st Century. After watching it, I have to ask myself if I missed something or if everyone else was looking at things that weren't there.Even though this film is getting such a low grade from me, I'm not angry that I spent time watching a movie I ended up disliking. All of the lead actresses were good and I can't fault director and writer Neil Marshall that much, either. While I think the movie had some pretty big story and character flaws, I get the feeling that Marshall had great pride in what he was doing and a great idea and just miscalculated because, as far as I can tell, his directing and writing isn't bad.You also can't fault the cinematography or the set design for this movie. Before entering the cave, the audience is treated to some wide shots of the forest and open areas. When the six girls enter the cavern, the camera is pressed up close to their face, giving off a sense of claustrophobia, especially when compared to the wide open shots we'd seen earlier. The sets are also believable as a real cavern while the darkness helps play to the horror element by allowing the only light to come from the girls' headlamps, glow sticks, flares, etc.While I did have some positive things to say about the movie, I feel that they are somewhat superficial when compared to the problems I found with the movie. Let's start at the way beginning with the death of Sarah's (Shauna Macdonald) husband (Oliver Milburn) and daughter (Molly Kayll). From that opening, you'd think it'd have some effect on the story or characters. Not really. Sarah sees glimpses of her daughter in the cave and hears her laughter at one point, but that's not even three minutes worth of footage. Allof that could have been cut out, take out the opening with the car crash, and you'd still have the same movie. The only thing you'd have to change is a few lines of dialogue and take out a few scenes. For what is one of the most important scenes in the movie, it really doesn't do much in the grand scheme of things.Next off, these characters are interchangeable. Granted, Juno (Natalie Mendoza) has some amount of character, but the others are flat and lack personality. Considering the story revolves around these six characters trying to escape from an undiscovered cavern while there's no help on its way, you'd think there should be something to make you care about the characters. Granted, there's about a five minute scene introducing (if that's what you'd call it) the six girls who will be on the spelunking trip, but not much is established during that part. Once they enter the cave, it's six boring characters with no personality trying to escape. I understand we're supposed to want them to escape because they're the characters we're following, but it's very hard to care about their outcome when they don't have anything that sets them apart or makes them interesting.My last major gripe is with how the horror element works in this movie. I already said above that the close camera shots on the characters while they're in the cave gives off a sense of claustrophobia which can make us feel uncomfortable, that's about it. The movie starts off by suggesting some sort of psychological horror story due to the death of Sarah's family. Then, when the characters get stuck in the cave in, it becomes a survival movie with the characters in a claustrophobic environment. Then, it becomes a creature feature complete with characters running around the caverns and fighting small Gollum from 'The Lord of the Rings'- esque creatures with their climbing equipment. The movie feels like it doesn't know what kind of horror movie it wants to be. Granted, it could be all three if it pulled it off, but it doesn't. The psychological family angle is only present for about five minutes of screen time, and the second we're introduced to the creatures, the cavern opens up to be large enough for out heroes to dash around and fight monsters, getting rid of the sense of claustrophobia.I can see why this movie got the level of appraise that it did and I do think there were some good ideas and talented people attached to it, but I think it was lacking in a lot of places. I will end this by saying while I didn't like 'The Descent', it's movie I wish I had liked and I might revisit someday to see if my view on it has changed.",4,3,8,5 March 2015
Scream 2," Better than the original
","I know my statement that 'Scream 2' is better than the first 'Scream' isn't a new one, but I have to jump on the bandwagon here because that is indeed the case. 'Scream 2' is not only better than the original, it's one of the best horror sequels I've seen and the best self- aware movie I've ever watched. While the later films in the 'Scream' franchise and the abominable '22 Jump Street' fail at the sequel self-awareness, 'Scream 2' succeeds creating an enjoying, scary, and entertaining second installment to a franchise. Opening up in a movie theater at the premiere of the film Stab, a movie based on the events of the first film, two college students (Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps) are brutally killed by someone dressed in the same costume as the original killer. The two college students just so happen to attend the same college as Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the main character of the first film. Along with Sidney are several characters returning from the previous film including her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy), police deputy Dewey (David Arquette), and ruthless news reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox). Also appearing as either victims or suspects are Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), her friends Hallie (Elise Neal) and Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), and the man that Sidney wrongly convicted of murdering her mother, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber).While self-awareness is something I usually hate in movies because I think it makes them hypocritical, 'Scream 2' does it right. For one thing the movie doesn't use self-awareness to cover for itself because it's a sequel. Along with that, though, the movie has a few clever inclusions to it to make it look like a typical sequel. A lot of the time, sequels are just the original redone in a different way. With the inclusion of people watching scenes from Stab, the audience is literally re-watching the same movie as the first one. Another example is Gale's cameraman Joel (Duane Martin) knows that to survive he has to get away before anything happens. He leaves the film half-way through, only to return at the end, unharmed and thus surviving the movie. The only time the self-awareness comes off as hypocritical is when a sorority girl named Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar) hears a noise and starts searching the house after she already had the bright idea to leave it.One thing the movie did was develop the characters more. In the first movie, Gale and Dewey are hinted at having some sort of interest in each other, but it's not anything important. In the second film, they expand on that idea to give them a deeper connection. The movie also displays the effects of the first film weighing heavily on Sidney, with minor things like slight differences in her characters actions and way of thinking to more extreme things with her not fully trusting Derek because of her boyfriend from the first movie's inclusion in the murder spree.This movie had a lot of scary and suspenseful moments, the best being when Sidney is rehearsing the play she's in and with all of the effects and extras dancing around on stage with fake weapons and creepy masks, she either sees or imagines the killer running around on stage trying to get her. This movie also carries on the use of elaborate red herrings that the first movie used, making you think it could be anyone. And while this movie does do that, the knowledge that this movie is a sequel makes you wonder whether or not they're going the same route or not.'Scream 2' is a well thought out self-aware horror film with a lot of attention placed into the atmosphere of the movie. The movie is aware that it's a sequel and that sequels are usually inferior to the original, but the people behind the movie worked to make it better. They did more with the characters, they didn't hit rewind with the story, they let the events from the first film actually effect the story, and made a suspenseful, scary movie all at the same time.",9,0,1,22 February 2015
Jaws," A scary thriller that builds suspense
","The original summer blockbuster, 'Jaws' is a great example to use to display Steven Spielberg's ('Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'E.T') knack for film making and directing. 'Jaws' is a one of a kind movie because the formula that it used to make it so scary and suspenseful has been attempted many other times on countless projects and usually failed.After a young girl is killed while swimming, Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) teams up with shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzly fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) to hunt down the killer beast before it can do more damage. All three actors deliver great performances, making their characters very memorable and creating a bond between them and the audience.Underneath the suspense and fear that the shark causes, there is a subtle but good message dealing with ethics. While Sheriff Brody wants to close the beach for fear of the lives of those in the water, Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) wants to keep the beaches open as it is the primary source of money to come into the community. A good thing that comes with this is that it could have easily made Mayor Vaughn out into looking like a horrible, unlikable person, but instead it makes him out to be a leader who made a choice for the greater good of his community that turned out to be the wrong move.The best part about the film that no other film, including the three 'Jaws' sequels, could pull off is the suspense. Originally, the shark was going to be seen more, but due to technical difficulties with it, the usage of the shark had to be dialed back. Instead, we just get glimpses of the shark when it attacks. The audience does not get to see the shark until the very end and instead all we have to work with are the brief glimpses we get of the shark and the description of the shark that is given. With that, the film adds another layer to the horror as the audience is building this horrific image in their mind of what the creature looks like. To keep that suspense, we only truly see the full shark within the last five minutes of the movie.With superb movie making and a killer soundtrack by John Williams, 'Jaws' is a classic and one of the scariest movies ever made. How can I say it is one of the scariest movies ever made? Try going back into the water after watching this film.",10,2,5,31 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This is what passes for a good movie?
","I am no stranger to the 'Star Wars' films. I have seen all six of them and even the infamous 'Clone Wars' movie from 2008. This terrifies me. I can understand people claiming this is the best of the prequels, but then there is all that talk about how it is as good or even better than 'Empire Strikes Back'. How is this film that popular? I do not understand.Let me start off with a few positives. This is the first film in the prequels where I have no questions from from the opening crawl and I understand what is going on and what is at stake and why I should care. Next, it downplays the romance element from 'Attack of the Clones' and the dialog has improved quite a bit.Now for the bad. The acting is terrible with the exception of Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Frank Oz, and to a lesser extent, Anthony Daniels and Jimmy Shmits (two actors of minor/supporting characters might I add). Hayden Christensen does improve from his performance from 'Attack of the Clones' but it all feels overplayed. Natalie Portman has a few good scenes but is overall bad in this film. Samuel L. Jackson is very monotone in this film, as is Christopher Lee. So with that, a majority of the main cast does not do very well in the acting department.A lot of things in the film are over or underdone. Most of the acting and story is underdone, the ending and the dark tone are overdone. It seems like to be a dark film, Lucas believes that it has to be PG-13. I'm sure that is not the case but it feels that way. The ending is more like a soap opera season finale than the actual climax to a film series with a plot element like Padme losing the will to live and a race against the clock to save the babies.A problem arises with the character of Anakin Skywalker. In the last film, it might have been understandable that he was whiny and arrogant as he was younger and less mature, but at this point he has been fighting the Clone Wars for several years and it has lessened, but only by a small amount. He still acts whiny and arrogant, claiming the council is holding him back from being a Jedi Master. And this is the guy we are supposed to feel sympathy for when he tragically falls to the dark side?You have no sympathy for Anakin and thus, you do not want to route for him in this film. To make matters worse, it isn't even one of those things where you want to route for the villains instead. You do not want to route for anyone. If you do not want to route for any of the characters than the film is boring, plain and simple.Once again, I have to ask: This passes for a good movie?",4,7,12,1 August 2013
The Secret Life of Pets," More Trash from Illumination Entertainment
","'The Secret Life of Pets' is a movie from the film studio Illumination Entertainment, whose biggest claim to fame has been the creations of the abominable minions from 'Despicable Me.' When little yellow creatures that speak gibberish are your studio's biggest highlight, it's no wonder their film turned out like this.'The Secret Life of Pets' is essentially all three 'Toy Story' movies rolled into one movie with three separate plot lines. The first movie about two rival toys who earn to respect and work with each other is given to the main characters of Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The second movie, where it focuses on all of the secondary characters from the first movie on a mission to save Woody, is showcased with the character Gidget (Jenny Slate) rounding up pets to look for Max and Duke. The antagonist of the movie, a white bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart) has the same character and motivation as Lots-o-Huggin bear from 'Toy Story 3.'With no original story elements, you'd think there would be an attempt to make the characters likable and engaging to watch, but no. Max and Duke start out as unlikable, and only become likable when they inexplicably begin working together. It makes sense that in one scene they would set aside their differences, but after that there is no reason for them to be working together. Then, they suddenly like each other without any reason to. Gidget is no better, as she dumbly trusts a hawk (Albert Brooks) who was clearly making threats to eat her, but the story must go on. Snowball sums up these idiotic and lazy character moments in one scene where, after trying to kill Max, says, 'We need to work together now,' and then everything is suddenly put behind them.Character stupidity is a big propeller of the plot, but pure coincidence is too. Almost no story elements feel like they organically happened, and instead feel contrived or tossed in to make the screenwriter's job easier. Take this for example, New York City is a big place (especially for animals who mostly don't know the city except for what's right outside of their apartments), yet everyone makes their way onto one of New York's bridges for the climax of the movie without having any reason to know that Max and Snowball are there, and thus giving them reason to be there.To put it in simple terms, this movie is lazy with its characters, uninspired with its story, and unfunny with its comedy. The only thing I can really say in its defense is that the story could at least be followed.",1,9,17,8 May 2017
Prometheus," Better than the first time I watched it
","When I first saw 'Prometheus' a year and a half ago, I described it as a hodgepodge of bad ideas. Taking a second look at it now, I realize that my original views on the film were a little harsh. 'Prometheus' in no way reaches the level that 'Alien' and 'Aliens' is on, but it is still an impressive movie with a few problems that do bog it down.After discovering a series of similar drawings on location of ancient civilizations that never had contact with one another, two scientists, Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) believe the drawings are a map back to their creator's home world. Sponsored by Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the crew of the Prometheus is sent to the location shown in the drawings to try and find the creators, who are dubbed engineers. Among the crew of the Prometheus is Vickers, a Weyland company employee named(Charlize Theron), an android named David (Michael Fassbender), Captain Janek (Idris Elba), a geologist named Fifield (Sean Harris), and a biologist named Millburn (Rafe Spall).Like the original 'Alien', it Scott makes the audience wait for the creatures to appear and the horror to start. Only after the movie is half over do we get the first casualties on the mission. The film also does have a scary premise that our creators are not happy with us, so they want to destroy us. The only problem with this is that the engineer who is trying to kill the crew of the Prometheus has no known motivation to do this.A problem that I had that I've never seen anyone else bring up is the lack of relationship between the characters. Yes, Shaw and Holloway are in a relationship, but it never actually feels like they are. Vickers is actually Weyland's daughter, but they are given very little screen time together, and Weyland views David as the son he never had, which could of had potential for an interesting relationship between Vickers and David. Shaw discovers that David killed Holloway, but is barely shown angry at him, until the end when he needs help and it feels like it comes out nowhere.Like most people, I think there were some dumb and confusing character moments in the film. Shaw and Vickers running in a straight line from the rolling ship is something everyone has pointed out, as is Millburn (the biologist) being scared off by a dead alien and then being interested in an alien snake creature. Fifield and Millburn get lost when the Prometheus has a sophisticated tracking system and Fifield has all the mapping equipment. David's motivation for infecting Holloway with the black goo is something that does not make a lot of sense.The movie does have very impressive visuals and some strong performances, the best coming from Fassbender as David. The entire landscape of the world that the crew was on looked amazing and like it was really there. The movie also has the second best scene in all of the Alien franchise with Shaw getting the creature cut out of her.The movie has a few problems that bog it down, but the movie is held up by its premise, the performances, the visuals, and Scott's superb directing. I didn't bring up anything about the loose ends because there were not as many as I remembered and none of them bogged the movie down for me. This is definitely a movie I like but I can understand why others might not.",7,3,7,26 October 2014
X2: X-Men United," Saying this movie is good is an understatement
","In the year 2000, after being postponed several times, the film 'X-Men' was released, gaining generally positive reception and kicking off not only the 'X-Men' franchise as a film franchise, but also a new line of 'Marvel Comics' films after the failure of other Marvel films like 'Howard the Duck'. Three years later, the sequel, 'X2: X-Men Unite' was released and was once again greeted by general approval. While the original 'X-Men' is still a superb film, 'X2' expands on the story and characters of the first film to deliver not only a sequel that surpasses its original, but one of the best superhero films ever made.After a mutant by the name of Kurt 'Nightcrawler' Wagner (Alan Cumming) infiltrates the White House, the fear that more of the humans feel towards the mutants becomes evident. Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox) uses this attack as an excuse for his plan to wipe out the mutant population once and for all. At the same time, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) searches for the truth about his past, which is also connected to Colonel Stryker.The film has numerous subplots and set-ups that in most movies would cause it to drag or lose focus, but with this film it succeeds. The subplots are interesting and give the audience a better look at some of the characters, and everything that the movie sets up is paid off to a satisfactory level.The best subplots of the movie that were done the best and were the most interesting, to me, were the two romances. The relationship between Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Bobby (Shawn Ashmore) is believable, not just because of the chemistry between the two, but because of the problems that they have. Both want to be closer, but Rogue's powers make it hard for them to have a normal relationship. The love triangle between Wolverine, Jean (Famkee Janssen), and Cyclops (James Marsden) is also believable, and the kind of love triangle I would like to see in other movies. Jean obviously likes both Wolverine and Cyclops and they both like her, but Jean can only choose one of them, which is something I would like to see done more.Overall, though, the best part of the whole movie was Wolverine and the discovery of his back story. For most of the movie, all we get are sudden flashbacks which provides us with enough details to get us interested, but not enough to give it away. Along with the flashbacks, we have Stryker telling Wolverine he was in charge of the project that turned Wolverine into the mutant he is. While the film does not dwell too much into Wolverine's back story, we learn that while Wolverine saw it as a curse, it might be what betters him as Stryker says Wolverine was just an animal that he provided claws.'X2' recaptures what made 'X-Men' so good and improves upon it. While the film contains many subplots and set-ups that would usually bog a movie like this down, it succeeds and provides one of the best superhero films ever made. The story is interesting, the characters are well written and earn your investment, and even with all of the characters time is given to each one. 'X2' succeeds on multiple levels of film making and story telling that does not disappoint.",10,0,1,15 January 2014
Thor: The Dark World," The worst of the best
","After the release of 'The Avengers' in 2012, Marvel entered what has been called the second wave of their films. The second wave contained sequels to films from the first wave, including 'Iron Man 3', 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and 'Thor: The Dark World'. Critically, 'Thor' from 2011 did better than 'Thor: The Dark World', but when it comes to the general moviegoers, they seemed to prefer the sequel over the original. 'Thor: The Dark World' is the film that I suspect most people wanted the first 'Thor' to be, a fun superhero-fantasy adventure featuring the hammer-wielding god. In those terms, the film succeeds and is decent, but of all the good Marvel films, it is the worst one.Taking place after 'The Avengers', Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has returned to Asgard with Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Thor soon learns that the Convergence, an alignment of the Nine Realms which will create portals between all of the realms, is going to occur soon. On earth, the girl Thor formed a relationship with in the first film, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), is infected by a red mist called Aether. Thor brings Jane to Asgard to help her, resulting in an attack on Asgard by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), a dark elf who wants the Aether for himself.The film's plot is so overly complex with magical and scientific gobbledygook that even with the help of websites to remember exactly what happened, I'm sitting here wondering if I explained it correctly. While the portals between realms and all of the magical powers in this film give for some fun action sequences, the film is still left a complicated mess that will leave you wondering whether or not you just are not smart enough to understand or if the film was just not smart enough to pull off what it was trying. I'm going with the latter on this one.Compared to the other Marvel movies, 'Thor: The Dark World' had the least effect on the cinematic world that these films are based in or on the characters in them. The first wave of films led up to 'The Avengers', which helped change Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in 'Iron Man 3', and helped change the world the films are based in in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. In this case, 'Thor: The Dark World' is a film where Thor just goes around, fights some monsters and dark elves with his hammer, and saves the day. Granted, the Aether will probably do something in an upcoming Marvel movie, but that could be way down the line in 'Thor 7: Filing Asgard's Taxes'. In the case of this film, there are no immediate effects to either the characters or the world.While 'Iron Man 3' also relied on an overuse of humor, 'Thor: The Dark World' takes it up to the Nth degree. It feels like there were two writers for the film, one who was told it was a superhero movie and the other was told it was a comedy movie. Then, both of them worked together and created a script that was half superhero and half comedy. The comic relief was welcomed every now and then, and some of the comedic elements were very humorous, but after a while, it started to get stale. A lot of the characters were made overly-witty and the expansion of Darcy (Kat Dennings) and the addition of her assistant Ian (Jonathan Howard) were comedic relief that went on too long and were sometimes given precedence over the story, sort of like the raccoon, hummingbird, and dog in 'Pocahontas'.While there were a lot of problems with the film, there were still some good elements to it. It was nice to see many of the characters again, including the always changing Loki (and I don't mean in appearance). Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) is another character I was excited to see again, who I believe was criminally underused in this film. I was hoping they would explore the love triangle between her, Thor, and Jane, but that never occurred. It was nice getting to see the all-seeing Heimdall (Idris Elba) a larger role this time around and the performance from Anthony Hopkins of Odin was superb.As I said before, the plot can be frustrating at times, but what it sets up makes for some fun action sequences and getting to see some cool worlds. The film also includes a good musical score.'Thor: The Dark World' takes 'The Avengers' spot in my opinion as the worst of the best Marvel movies. Its overly complex plot makes little sense and there is no immediate effect on the world or characters, but it is a fun ride with some occasional good humor and it does let us see some of our favorite characters from another realm.",6,0,0,22 April 2014
The Purge," This had so much potential
","When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was going to be great. The premise was one I had never heard before; all crime is legal for twelve hours including murder and we get to witness it happen. While simple it is a premise that we have never seen before and had a lot of potential to be good. What did they do? They turned it into another home invasion movie. That's right, they take a new premise and turn it into something we have seen a thousand times. Who knew you could make a new idea feel old on the first try?From the previews, it looks like a good movie, but when you actually watch it, the film does a terrible job in covering up the plot holes and nonsensical motivations of the characters. Throughout the whole movie, I was questioning how the Purge actually benefited the economy and people. Guess what, it is never explained. They just expect us not to ask these questions that would help us understand motivation in the movie and then it goes unexplained.The characters in the film are horrible. The only characters I was routing for in any way was the man the man the son lets in because he did not deserve what was happening, and the father because he was the only character with an actual personality. The film kept pretending that its characters were deep when they really weren't. They were blank slates to fit in an opposing view on everything, but it was not done in a good way. All they do is question the other people and not put out any good arguments for their point.If I were to make a suggestion of how to make the movie better, I would say do not follow the people in the house who are fighting off the invaders. Follow the person being hunted or the people participating in the Purge to see what is motivating them to take part in it. The motivations are unexplained or nonsensical, there are numerous plot holes that are impossible to look past, and the characters are uninteresting.I would say only see this movie if you are looking for a bad film to watch at a Halloween party that everyone can laugh at because this is all this film is good for.",3,1,1,20 October 2013
Munich," Well Shot and Acted, Everything Else is Eh
","Steven Spielberg has made a lot of good historical dramas in his career. 'Bridge of Spies' and 'Saving Private Ryan' were both excellent, and 'Schindler's List' is the best movie I've ever seen. I was looking forward to watching this movie, but unfortunately I was let down.'Munich' follows a group of Israelis who are tasked with hunting down and killing the terrorists of Black September who were responsible for the Munich Massacre at the 1972 Olympic Games.To make a historical drama good, you need one of two things. You either need an interesting historical figure to base the movie around, or you need an interesting historical event that's on-screen progression will enthrall people. 'Bridge of Spies' and 'Schindler's List' had both of these elements. 'Munich' has neither.The characters in the movie are all interchangeable with one another and have no real personality. The five members of Eric Bana's team are all the same person, except they each have a different skill.The historical story chosen doesn't have anything of interest happening in it either. It is just a typical revenge story. Even more detrimental, it does not feel like there is a satisfactory conclusion to the story. It just isn't a very interesting piece of history to make into a three hour long movie. A better piece of history to focus on would have been the actual Munich massacre instead of the aftermath.While this is a bad historical drama, I can not say in good conscious that is a bad movie. The movie is well written, well shot, well acted, and well directed for the most part. There is one scene where the way it was put together was confusing. The only technical aspect that was bad was the lighting, as every scene was saturated with light and looked ugly.There are a lot of good historical dramas out there, and a lot of good ones made by Steven Spielberg. This is not one of them.",5,1,5,5 May 2016
Godzilla," A fun summer blockbuster
","When I was younger, I was a big fan of Godzilla. I watched a lot of the older movies and the Roland Emmerich 'Godzilla' from 1998. Despite the love I had for these movies when I was younger, I had since lost interest in the films and did not think much about them. When I heard about this movie being released, I was interested in seeing it, but I had some fears that it would be an overblown, dumb monster vs. monster action movie with no time or thought put into it. Thankfully, I was wrong.Opening up in the Philippines in 1999, the skeletal remains of a large creature are discovered after a mining accident. Inside the skeleton, there are two pods, one closed and one opened. A trail of destruction leads from the opened pod to the ocean. Meanwhile, in Japan, seismic activities start to occur at a power plant. The activity around the power plant costs the lives of many people, including the main character, Ford's (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) mother (Juliette Binoche). The event causes Ford's father (Bryan Cranston) to spend the next fifteen years looking for answers.Ford is called to Japan fifteen years later when his father is arrested for entering a quarantine zone. Ford decides to help his father reenter the quarantine zone, but they are captured and brought to the old power plant. At the plant, there is more seismic activity and a creature awakens, which ends up mortally wounding Ford's father and escaping out to the ocean. Ford attempts to go home, finding himself in the midst of destruction caused by the creature, and decides to help the military kill it so he can return to his wife (Elizabeth Olsen) and his son (Carson Bolde).What took me by surprise is how the story was told. Godzilla and the other creatures do fight in the movie, but there is barely any of the fight shown. It mostly focuses on Ford and whoever he's with trying to get a mission underway that they believe will kill the creatures. I think many people would probably be underwhelmed with the movie for this fact, but I liked it because barely showing the fights and showing what the characters are doing during the fights is something not a lot of monster movies do.The characters of the movie are pretty bland and forgettable. Ford is your typical main character who is a husband and father trying to do what's best for his family. His family is just his family, though they did not bother me like a lot of families in movies do. Ford's dad, played by the brilliant Bryan Cranston, is misused as a character who mostly spouts exposition and then dies. Dr. Ishiro Serizawa is just a scientist. There isn't anything interesting about the characters, but that is made up for by the scale of the movie and the amazing effects.The path of destruction ranges from Japan, to Hawaii, to Las Vegas, to San Francisco, and there is a lot of diversity to the destruction. Sometimes we just see the creature march through the area, we see Godzilla cause a tsunami when he first arrives in Hawaii, and we see naval ships being tossed from the water. With the little bit of monster vs. monster we see in the movie, it is exciting and a blast to watch. My only complaint is that I would have liked to see one of the monsters go through a smaller town, just to see what the destruction would be like in a place that wasn't a big city.Godzilla has never looked better on the big screen. The towering creature looks like he is actually there, and his laser breath blast looks real. The effects of the film are also really good. The weather effects used during the battle between Godzilla and the other creatures in San Francisco set a very eerie mood and tone.'Godzilla' is in no way a brilliant movie, but when it comes to summer blockbusters, it is a lot of fun. It does have pretty boring characters like a lot of summer action movies do, but the story is thought out and well paced, you can tell what is happening amid the destruction, and the monsters look amazing.",8,2,5,18 May 2014
300," Has so little to it
","I've wanted to write a review of this movie for a while, but since the movie had so little to offer, I didn't really know how I could write one. Now, I've come to realize that if this movie barely had anything, than that's what my review could be: a short review of what was wrong with this movie.Right off the bat, the screen is filled with extremely ugly visual effects, which is one of only two things the movie offers. The movie tries so hard to make these visuals look abstract or artistic, but they come off looking ridiculous and stupid. The only other thing the movie has to offer are artistic action sequences, which, while entertaining the first time you see them, get boring by the end. So, the two things the movie has going for it are artistic visuals and battle sequences, which are both shown within the first half of the movie so the second half is completely boring because you've seen everything the movie has to offer.Now, a lot of movies show the majority of what they have to offer in the first half of the movie, but those movies still have an engaging story and characters to be invested in throughout the film. The only character you'll remember by the end of this movie is King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), which is only because of his famous line, 'This is Sparta!' before kicking an enemy messenger into a pit. What about the story? Three hundred Spartan warriors led by Leonidas go off to fight an invading Persian army. The entire movie is just them getting ready to fight and fighting. That's all there is to the story, which isn't interesting, which is mixed with uninteresting characters, so what's there to like about this movie?There is almost nothing to this movie. It's a bunch of special effects and artistic action sequences thrown onto a screen for two hours with nothing to engage you.",1,2,6,7 March 2015
Pocahontas," Lacks what made the other Disney movies good
","Between the years of 1989 and 1999, the Walt Disney Animated Studios were in a period of a renaissance where they created a long line of well-received animated films. Starting in '89 with the release of 'The Little Mermaid' and ending in '99 with the release of 'Tarzan', this period for Disney saw the creation of some of Disney's most well-known and popular films to date. The track record with the Disney films during this time period was mostly positive, with some minor slip-ups like 'Hercules', none of the films were, in general terms, bad movies. That is until Disney released its sixth renaissance film 'Pocahontas' in 1995. 'Pocahontas' is a prime example of a film that lacks focus or what made the other Disney films enjoyable.'Pocahontas''s major flaw to it is that the film loses its focus from time to time, jumping to slapstick routines between a raccoon, hummingbird, and a dog for comic relief. The other Disney films had comic relief as well, whether Timone and Pumba from 'The Lion King' or Mushu from 'Mulan', but their comedic contribution to the film can be worked into the story to give an idea of their characters or deliver comedic relief. In 'Pocahontas', time is taken out of the movie just for the trio of animal's slapstick routine that adds nothing to the story or develops their characters. The film also lacks the fun and energy that the other Disney films had, making this film unmemorable. Both Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) and John Smith (Mel Gibson), lack any characterization and are the most generic and boring Disney characters I've ever seen put on screen. The villain of the film, Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) not only does not match up to the line of villains Disney has, but he is not a good villain in general. The other villains like Scar (Jeremy Irons), Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer), or Hades (James Wood) all had something that made them memorable, whether Scar's sinister planning, Hades' comedic charm, or the fear affiliated with Shan-Yu. Ratcliffe has no discernible personality or charm to his character and just elicits laughter towards him because of how poorly he is portrayed as a villain.One thing Disney is most famous for is the songs created for its films. Songs from their films, like the films themselves, are some of the most well-known songs ever to be written for movies, from 'Lion King''s 'Hakuna Matata' to 'Mulan''s 'I'll Make a Man Out of You', they are songs that anyone who's seen the movie remember. Even if the majority of the songs in the movie are forgettable, there is usually at least one memorable song. With 'Pocahontas', this is sort of the case, it has a slightly memorable song, but does not stand out much when compared to the other Disney songs.'Pocahontas' is a film that lacks focus and all of the elements that made the other Disney films good. Every other Disney film in the renaissance period had something memorable about it, whether a character or a song, which 'Pocahontas' does not have. It relies too much on the slapstick routine of a raccoon, hummingbird, and dog for comedic relief which takes away from the film, and its characters are bland and forgettable. In short, 'Pocahontas' is the worst film from the Disney Renaissance and possibly one of Disney's worst movies.",3,5,11,16 April 2014
The Simpsons Movie," The best a 'Simpsons' fan could hope for
","Ever since I was young, I was a huge fan of 'The Simpsons'. So, naturally, when this film was released, I was very excited to see it and my family and I saw it in the theaters. While the preview for the film were misleading, the film was hilarious and a great experience for a anyone, let alone a 'Simpsons' fan.The film opens up nicely with the usual theme music and the voice saying, 'The Simpsons', and the audience is brought into Springfield for another fun adventure with the dysfunctional family we have been watching for a very long time. Within the first ten minutes, I knew things were okay. There had been many jokes that were funny and the story was set up in a way that only a show like 'The Simpsons' could do correctly. The film does a good job in setting up each member of the family and they each get a different story arc to follow. Each story arc is set up in a comical way that anyone can laugh at and they all tie into the overall story. The humor is similar to that of a regular 'Simpsons' episode and there are a lot of funny moments. Unfortunate that this is one of the last times that 'The Simpsons' was extremely funny, the writers did not fail to come up with material to make us laugh. Everything in this movie was done really well from the comedy to the characters to the story. Each Springfield resident has at least some moment to shine and the only disappointing thing is that this is the last time 'The Simpsons' was extremely funny, but whatever, it was a good run and with this film, the era of wonderful and clever humor on 'The Simpsons' went out with a bang.",8,0,1,21 August 2013
