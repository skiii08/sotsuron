Come and See," I can't tell
","This is one of those rare situations where you can't really tell how you feel. Throughout this whole movie we continually get slapped kicked and punched by our emotions. There is no possible way we can all feel like the character in this movie, or even try to understand what he is going through. But if there was one possible way for the director to make us feel what he felt the director provided it for us, If there was one, and only one way for the movie to be directed and it definitely did that. There were points in the movie to where I had to turn my face away because the cruelty was just too much. He didn't even have to tells us, hey look at what these people did don't you hate them. NO he just told the story from a totally subjective view and sat back and let us draw our own conclusions.",8,7,9,11 June 2008
Ran," vengeance of a woman
","I think it is so interesting how throughout this whole movie people thought there were making their own decisions, when in actuality they were being manipulated. The father was manipulated and betrayed by his own men, or should I say man; when his adviser told him to go to one of the castles, but when he got to the castle there was a trap and there was a battle, or more like a slaughter. The outcome of that was the father loosing his whole following of men and soldiers. While the other brother and the king of that particular castle got killed. which only left two brothers, but by the end of the movie there was only one of the brothers left, who was going to die anyway. And by far the best manipulator was the older brothers new wife, who was fueling his lust for more power, with her lust for revenge.",8,1,4,9 June 2008
