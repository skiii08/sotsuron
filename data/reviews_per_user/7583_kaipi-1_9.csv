The Blair Witch Project," Wow
","Really people, has movie making really fallen this far that this pile of vomit is not on the bottom 100 list? Yes, I know, there's a lot of terrible movies out there and unfortunately there's always someone who will think it's brilliant but I'm not one of those people. This movie was so horrible that it was... um, horrible. That' all there there really is t say about it. It was a completely pointless idiotic waste of time with no redeeming qualities, if there was a zero rating, this would definitely be down there, but they don't let us have any fun. I don't even remember what it was about, and while, yes, I did have a pretty bad seizure from the camera shots which can't be helping my memory much, I doubt I'd remember much anyway. It just looked like a bunch of hippies, once again, botching an already botched attempt at movies. This movie was worse than drinking an entire compressed can of ten year old vomit that has been fermenting in the sun.",1,2,3,27 August 2008
Ratatouille," An Eight!?
","An 8.3! Are you serious? Rat's do not cook! Rat's get into your kitchen and chew holes through all of your food, they spread diseases, they make scritchy scratchy noises up and down your walls, they rip up your laundry and make a nest behind your heater and in your air conditioner, but they don't cook! Yes I hate rats too; right up there with mice, penguins, carpenter bees, and poodles. Rats are disgusting, they bite and have fleas. More irritating is the attempt to make this movie funny, the French are not funny, not in any way. And besides if they were really french people they would have screamed like little girls until it snapped itself in a trap, then they would have chopped it up and cooked it into the soup. Don't see this movie in other words.",1,20,81,12 March 2008
Mamma Mia!," What's going on?
","This movies title was misleading, I thought it was going to be a documentary on the Super Mario Brothers but no. There was no Mario nor was there Luigi, Princess, or those little mushroom things you jump on. In fact, I don't even know what this was about. I remember walking in paying for my ticket getting a vat of popcorn expecting to see a Mario documentary, I took my seat. About ten minutes later the movie started and five or ten minutes after that(Yeah I'm surprised I lasted that long too) I blacked out. Well I was in a big void with some swirling colors and dancing bananas for a while and when I came to I was in an ambulance. Apparently I had a seizure and hurt myself when some college student who apparently liked the movie tried to hold me still while I was flopping around. Who taught her first aid! Anyway the doctor examined me and determined that I was not epileptic and that the seizure was caused by terror; then he suggested that I avoid any movie based on a Broadway musical. And that how my day at the movies went.",1,8,19,4 August 2008
Stardust," it's not worth a dog turd
","Here's what happened when they made this movie. They took the writers for HArry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and Pirates of the Caribbean and threw them in a room with Peter Pan playing in the background. This pile of crap is what they came up with. Between a gay pirate's flying ship whose balloon is insufficiently sized to keep it aloft and some kind of magic dust that throws you across the world; and if that's not enough to keep you away then nude octogenarian witches will be. Even though they don't show the whole thing, they don't need to! It's disgusting and I suggest that if you pull this one off the bottom of a lake with your fishing pole, you throw it back.",1,19,63,12 March 2008
Event Horizon," overall pretty stupid
","It's the kind of movie that leaves you thinking, what? The plot was fine but they tried to make it better by adding a bunch of special effects placed in inappropriate places.This movie messed up where all horror movies do, showing too much of the monster too soon in the movie. And when you did see it, it wasn't all that good. Plus, they explain the problem like eight times, I should think that once would be enough. That just got irritating, I get it, the ship went to hell and came back, get on with it.I think they just tried to put too much in too little time. It left nothing open, it was extremely predictable, and there was no suspense. I just found it annoying.",4,3,5,20 January 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," I want to test your blood
","What just happened, why would these people ruin a perfectly good book by trying to make it appealing to the stupid drug addicted skate boarder type? Seriously this movie was crap, runny nasty smelly crap that cost a lot of money. We could solve world hunger with the amount of money being thrown at these movie makers who think they have any amount of talent. But it doesn't have to be that way, just get people who aren't high to make movies and we can go on happily ignoring the starving people. I don't really care what it's used for, just so that these uncreative hippies aren't getting a penny. They could have just as easily made Dracula good or, better yet, just came up with a new idea, but that would be hard and it's much easier to take a good book and make it into a bad movie. How bad was it? Keanu Reeves bad. Come on, he actually looks high. In fact, I think the people in charge of this piece of garbage were his dealers. Really, if I wanted to see people reading their lines without emotion I'd watch a small business commercial on the public access network, he's that bad. In fact, the only good actor was Gary Oldman, and it looks like he doesn't even care, though I can't say I'd blame him, I think the primary writing instrument for the script was a bong! It looks like they were reading off of cue cards the whole time. In fact, if you watch very carefully, Reeves actually squints whenever he has a line. On the plus side, I didn't get hurt because of this movie it was just awful.",1,12,23,12 August 2008
1408," Please shoot me
","This movie was terrible. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't so much as waste your time thinking about whether or not to watch it. You'll get something more intelligible if you turn on the Tele-Tubbies.First this movie makes that one annoying assumption. That all writers act like idiots to do research for books. Wrong! Nope, we mostly just sit in a chair eating pretzels and reading about nonsense until an idea arises. The tone of the story is basically that 'Hi, I'm an author, I want to stay in the haunted hotel room.' Then he gets stuck in there and some weird stuff happens with TV ghosts, then he burns down the room and some more crazy stuff happens and he almost drowns then it's over and you sit there and wonder what the crap you just watched.",1,7,12,2 March 2008
Pineapple Express," I fell asleep and got hurt again
","This movie was a pile of cow crap. Although that may be a bit unfair because cow crap can still serve a purpose as fertilizer. This was just a complete waste of a movie budget which I'll assume was spent entirely on drugs. Because that's the only way this movie could have possibly been produced. This movie was so bad that, while I was working, at the drive-in movie theater, I actually fell asleep, while walking across the field, and whacked my head on a slab of concrete that used to be some kind of heater thing. I don't actually know what it is, but it's filled with wasps and when I hit it they stung me several times. This movie was terrible, it wasn't funny, it wasn't cool, it was like watching other people smoke pot and that's never all that funny. If I wanted to see that I could have gone to work and then yelled at them. Oh, wait, I was at work, and I did yell at them, all twenty five of them. And what do you know, the ones on pot were also the only ones laughing, the rest of the people who made it through the terrible plot were also asleep; and guess who had to wake them? That's right, my pet robot R2-D2. Wait, I don't have a robot, but I may have a concussion and I need a quick trip to the hopsspitol, hospital sorry.",1,20,47,11 August 2008
Donnie Darko," I tried, I really did
","I don't get it, I watched this one night and I just didn't get it. It made no sense whatsoever. A Bunch of people wanted me to see this one so I figured eh, what's the worst that could happen? I'll waste a couple of hours, at most. Well I was wrong, not only was it so confusing that.... that, I don't even know what, it was just really confusing, and the fact that I kept trying to figure out what was what made this long movie so long. Now it's been almost two years since I saw it, I tried watching it again, and I still don't get it, not that I'm losing any sleep over it, only 392 hours. So I really see no point in wasting any more time with it.That's all.",1,23,50,15 August 2008
