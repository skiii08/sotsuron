The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Slow Crawl
","I was excited to watch this after Catching Fire but 30 to 45 minutes into it, I thought it was me that the movie was moving so slow. The worst part of this movie is Katniss' character role. It's depressing and she has no real script. All she had to do for her part was practice her facial expressions and emotions because there was nothing else coming from her. When I realized the movie was over 2 hours long, I groaned. On one hand I'm waiting for the action to begin and on another, when it does, the reigns are pulled in and it continues it's slow crawl. It's a sleeper. I can honestly tell you that a part of me wanted to see Katniss killed off just to end my pain. I might take the critics advice and shut this off before it's over and just wait for Part 2.",4,4,6,26 March 2015
