Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just a set up for the next ones ...
","NOT a good film!  Lots of action, yes, but Liam Neeson clearly mailed in his performance, and Ewan Macgregor was worse.  Only the little boy was any good, and the story was minimal.  Maybe episodes 2 and 3 will make this one make sense.",5,0,1,6 July 1999
Notting Hill," A good, sweet, lovely film!
","Hugh Grant is WONDERFUL!  I know he says he hates acting, but performances like this one don't look like acting at all ... and it's a great pleasure to see both Hugh and Julia Roberts cast in roles so obviously written for them! He is just devastatingly handsome, and that character is so appealing! This film plays directly to the strengths of both actors and give us exactly what we as moviegoers want from them.  Not challenging for them, perhaps, but wonderful for us!",9,0,0,6 July 1999
