Ford v Ferrari," Oscar worthy
",Matt Damon and Christian Bales Performances were out of this world even the side characters gave a good account of themselves. Story is a bit tough to understand at first but it all makes up in the Drama/Suspense and Action of the film. 10 stars.,10,1,2,27 January 2020
Suicide Squad," Just Bad.
","This movie just sucks! No proper Plot. BS scenes, complete butchery of the Joker Role by that actor. And much more.",3,1,1,25 January 2020
Avengers: Endgame," I cried...
","Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had. It was for the best. Hope to see the greatest character come back some day or get his own movie.",10,45,71,7 August 2019
