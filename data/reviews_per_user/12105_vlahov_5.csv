United 93," Awful.
","So I am required to put 10 lines for this. Let me begin with the statement that I truly regret for the lives of the innocent victims who died on 9/11, both on the two Towers and in the planes involved. I'd be human without soul if I haven't. Still I have firm opinion that this movie is shameless piece of sh*t and should have never been made. The reasons - it is completely fiction, based on no facts whatsoever, the plot is imaginary and sucked out of the fingers. Actually there unfortunately are no any clear evidence of what had happened on the board so the speculations may begin. Here we have evil Arab terrorists kidnapping plane with plastic knives (no, this is not 'Is there a pilot on the plane' 2). For me the circumstances - that not a single body was found (they simply vaporized), as well as explosives of any kind but still the plane exploded (I remember the CNN news that day and have recorded it on tape) are enough to not trust the original version. The real problem is so many American people believes blindly to what The Government says. So blessed the fools are. Also, I noticed that despite the dullness of a movie, there will always be a bunch of vivid fans shouting 'Oh my God, this is the best movie ever!' I am telling you this before some user feels offended of truth and report this for being abusing.",1,18,45,1 September 2007
Transformers," Transformers - a diagnose of the modern American society taste (or lack of)
","Well, it isn't the 'movie' itself which is bothering me. Mr Bay hasn't betrayed his usual bad way of film-making, or not making film at all. He certainly has no clue of directing and is the world's worst director of all times, putting Ed Wood deeply behind, but for no apparent reason is loved by Americans too. This is something I could not explain. What we have here is some ludicrous attempt backed with money and nothing else. Like some boy who was playing with so expensive toys Mr Bay has shown us he would do the same thing over and over again, just because someone down there gives green light for his movies. The flaws are so many I cant bear to count. The script is non existing. They could hire a schoolboy who would do better than current one. For those that yell 'but this is only a remake of the animated cartoon series so what script goddamn it' I'll answer that even the bad movies around often have acceptable scripts. This is just a turkey. For 2 and a half long hours we are pressed to watch something that cant decide for itself what it wants to be - a cheap teen comedy with insulting jokes, sleazy romantic drama or parody in the end of the long run. Everything except what its pretending to be. The fact that imbecile movies like that one are given such high ratings (I kid you not, this one has greater ratings than The Godfather and The Deer Hunter!) is truly, madly, deeply beyond me. It says something for the American society as whole. It seems that so many people can go to something so low and cheap that it becomes nearly a tragedy. I am so happy of not sharing it.What really bothers me (and surely pisses me off) is the fact this turd wrapped in toilet paper is so highly praised and received so great ratings here. What's wrong with you guys? No, I mean, seriously - are you all so easily amused? From such things as masturbation and pee jokes? Have you fallen so low that Marianas Trench is not deep enough for you? I keep asking these questions who might be never answered...",1,12,24,28 August 2007
World Trade Center," Total and big disappointment! Non-American viewers, beware!
","First, I vote 1 for this dreadful piece of celluloid just because IMDb hadn't provided negative votes yet. Absolutely big disappointment coming from one of the finest directors of all time - Oliver Stone. Having in mind that he directed such masterpieces as JFK and Naturally born killers, I have no excuse for him making such blatant propaganda movie except for the paycheck. Every single clichÃ© you name it, you have it here. Patriotism is flowing from every possible hole, the opposite of smart Bush showing like a cockroaches from every frame. Yes, for sure, Americans do deserve to have such idiotic film made for such tragic event, so let them have it. A apropos, when do we have movie about more than half million innocent civilians killed in Iraq by Americans? For all those women and children cold-heartedly slaughtered and maimed by American soldiers and not even statistically put as collateral damages? A movie about how the US invasion of Iraq provoked and increased the uniting of the world terrorism in that poor country? Where is THAT movie, mister Stone?",1,172,336,25 November 2006
Shrek," A total brilliant! A MUST SEE!
","Just to add my 2 cents: This is the funniest, the most beautiful, the most ironic  3D anime movie I've ever seen. One of my all time favorities! I was wondering: has the donkey been created after Eddie Murphy agreed to voice the part or before? :) The script, the making, the humor are unbelievable good. Definitely A must See, A must Buy, A must rent! I have already bought it the first time it appeared on the online stores. And one last thought: Let Mike Myers do the voice parts only, this is the only way for him not to humiliate himself any more with idiotic roles such as in 'Austin Powers' sequels.",10,0,0,17 November 2001
The Island," Hahahaha ... go and SEE this crap !!!
","No, please excuse me, but I just can't stop laughing. I've just returned from a cinema and was thinking AGAIN after Kill Bill that only in America one can so shamelessly steal other people's ideas and scripts, put several zillions of dollars in this turd and then get away from it. This is indeed the land of the boundlessly opportunities you know. This movie steals blatantly from so many good examples of the genre that it is difficult for me to count them all, but still I can try:Logans Run, 1984 (especially), The Matrix, Star Wars - ROTJ, Coma, The 6th Day ...And never mind how stinky this movie is (and it has great promise the first 30 minutes, but Mister Bay was feeling that he is obliged to ruin it later with mindless action sequences) there will be still at least one American to claim it as The best movie I have ever seen!'OK I got it. This is democracy, right? The right of being stupid, making every profit out of it - that's how Hollywood movies are being made these days. So you are now warned.",1,30,55,27 August 2005
