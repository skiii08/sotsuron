"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Toward the Acceptance of Diversity
","This is a film that every straight person should see. The screenwriter created three drags queens from the cloth of everyday life Â— an older person (who happens to be transgendered), an average guy next door and a pretty muscle boy. You can say that this film is about 'the great reach of little lives' (a comment originally applied by Donald Spoto to Tennesee Williams' 'The Glass Menagerie.') We also see, in Anthony Bellerose's story, that sexuality is not a cut-and-dried affair. Underneath it all, we see that these people aren't much different from those we meet ion our daily lives. A screening of 'Priscilla' would do more good than a hundred lectures to high school kids on the acceptance of diversity.",10,58,81,15 January 2005
