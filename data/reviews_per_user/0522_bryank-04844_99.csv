Despicable Me 2," 'Despicable Me 2′ is quite enjoyable, despite lacking the emotional pull the first film had. It's packed with laughs, terrific visuals and great voice work.
","In terms of box office, it may be difficult for 'Despicable Me 2′ to beat its predecessor, which made over $543 million just three years ago. Nevertheless, the directors and writers are back again with Steve Carrell as the wacky former criminal mastermind Gru, who we last saw stealing the moon. How can one top that? This fun sequel may lack the heart and soul of the first film, but it's still highly entertaining for both kids and adults with its amazing animated visuals, laughs, great voice cast and those lovable Minions.A small amount of time has passed since the last movie. We see Gru happily living his new life, free of any villainous activity. Sure, he still has his weapons, but he uses them more to get rid of annoying neighbors who constantly want to set him up with their single girlfriends. Gru still takes care of his three adopted daughters: Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher). In the middle of a BBQ birthday party for Agnes, he's kidnapped by the Anti-Villain League to help find a new dastardly criminal who has stolen a top-secret research lab, by way of a giant flying magnet.Gru gets paired with the incredible new AVL recruit Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig). They're told to set up an undercover operation at a frilly cupcake shop in a fancy mall. Their Intel says that the villain is also undercover in the mall. The two will have to find out who the mystery man is before the world meets its impending doom. Gru quickly suspects the boisterous Eduardo Perez (Benjamin Bratt), owner of a wild Mexican restaurant and a dead ringer for the evil villain El Macho, who was thought to have died a long time ago when riding a shark with tons of explosives into an active volcano. (Take note, Syfy Network!)These types of situations make the new installment a bit more bonkers than the first movie, but the creative team makes it work, even if this one seems to be more about the action and adventure than telling a story. It's nice to see Gru's daughters help him out in a side-story about dating. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments when Gru goes on a blind date. And of course the Minions are back in full force.Carrell and Wiig do stellar jobs lending their voices to make these characters truly come alive, but the real star of the show is Benjamin Bratt as El Macho. Al Pacino was once attached to play this part, but dropped out for creative differences. I'm so glad this happened, as Bratt just owns the voice role. Russell Brand returns as Dr. Nefario, and Steve Coogan and Ken Jeong have minor but hilarious parts as well.'Despicable Me 2′ is quite enjoyable, despite lacking the emotional pull the first film had. It's packed with laughs, terrific visuals and great voice work. The Minions are amped up to 11 this time around and perform a few musical numbers, which will certainly make you laugh out loud. Don't forget to stay through the credits, as our little yellow Minions hold auditions.",7,0,0,23 August 2015
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," I'm sure this film will go well with 'Part 2', but as of now, it's just a sedated piece of filler that will prep us for the next big film
","Things are not looking up for Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in this third installment of Suzanne Collins' young adult book series 'The Hunger Games'. In an effort to squeeze as much money as they can, the movie studio decided to split the third and final book into two parts, much like the last two 'Harry Potter' films and the recent trilogy of the single book of 'The Hobbit'. On one hand, the fans will get two movies. On the other hand, there will be a lot of filler between these two films to stretch them out to their two-hour run time.Rest assured, 'Mockingjay Part 1' is a dark movie. War has begun between the Capital, led by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the new resistance, led by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore). Since the studio executives decided to split this third story into two films, this first part serves as a promo for all the action and excitement for the next film, which is unfortunate, because the last two films were quite good. 'Mockingjay Part 1' is basically just a bunch of filler and setup for something bigger and greater. The pacing is much slower than the last two films and might have you yawning or checking your watch a few times throughout.That being said, it's still a decent enough movie with good performances, excellent visual effects, and good camera work. And it's a must-see if you want to stay in the story line of this book series, but as a stand alone film, it doesn't amount to much at all. It's just a bummer, we all have to sit through this first part to get to the meat and potatoes of Part 2. I'm going to assume that you all have seen the first two films, but if not, I suggest you watch those and read our review HERE, before you proceed. 'Mockingjay Part 1' starts off right where 'Catching Fire' left off, with Katniss rescued from the last game, while Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) was kidnapped and taken to the Capital.Katniss was rescued by the resistance with President Coin and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) running the show. Their goal is to take down the evil Capital, by uniting all the people who are now basically slaves to the Capital and evil President Snow to rebel and regain their freedom. Their strategy is to use Katniss as a symbol of the Mockingjay to make a series of commercials to amp up the spirit of the people to rebel. So Katniss travels from section to section, where the Capital is bombed and killed thousands of people for treason. Katniss sees this destruction and either sings or cries into a speech. Her camera crew films, and the people back at the resistance broadcast it all over the world. This leads to a bunch of people standing up to the Capital.Meanwhile, Peeta is sending video messages out to the people, telling the resistance and Katniss to stop this war and lay down their guns, but Peeta seems to be getting physically and mentally worse with each video. So what did we find out in 'Part 1'? That a big war is coming to a head and that Peeta and Katniss have some issues to work out. That's about it. While this is definitely the most sinister and darker of the 'Hunger Games' films so far, it is by far the slowest. At least the visual effects are all top notch and the one big action scene was quite good, but it was over before you could blink.I'm sure this film will go well with 'Part 2', but as of now, it's just a sedated piece of filler that will prep us for the next big film. And if the filmmakers chose to end this installment five minutes earlier, with a big cliff hanger, instead of a fizzled out ending, the movie would have left a better taste in my mouth.",4,2,4,12 August 2015
The Monuments Men," Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this.
","George Clooney has had an amazing track record of films he has been in and directed. From 'Good Night and Good Luck' to 'From Dusk Till Dawn', the brilliant man seems to know what he is doing. Clooney is also no stranger to war movies, as he has been involved in several different war films, but he has yet to direct one up until now with 'Monuments Men'. Sure, you can argue that 'Monuments Men' isn't a 'war film', but rather more of an art heist movie, but I would argue against that.I would categorize this film in the 'war' genre as it takes place during WWII, has battle scenes, soldiers, training camp, and Hitler. This story is a great story, one that you might not have heard of if it weren't for this film, but it's a mess of a movie from top to bottom, which is unfortunate, because it has an amazing cast. As the film would let you know at the beginning, 'This is a True Story', and it is. The film follows a small group of older men who head out to Europe at the tail end of WWII, in order to find and take back all of the art stolen by the Nazis for Hitler's giant art museum, which never came to be. In true fashion, the film starts out as 'Ocean's 11' started out with Frank Stokes (Clooney) trying to recruit a team to head to Europe.His first recruit is 'Ocean's 11' alum Matt Damon, and the two sit at a bar, drink, laugh, and talk about the operation. It is never explained what Stokes actually does in the film, other than he is a lover of everything art. He explains this to the President of the United States, who then allows him to form a team and head overseas. We see Stokes recruit several other older gentleman who are all art scholars of some sort including John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Dean Dujardin, and Hugh Bonneville. He doesn't recruit younger men, as most of them are already overseas on 'more important' operations.One of the main problems with 'Monuments Men' is its characters. There is no single trait to distinguish each character. They all seem to run together with the exception of Bill Murray's character who receives a little bit of background and emotion. Other than that, it is difficult to really feel for any of these characters, no matter what fate my serve them. So this team, as they've dubbed themselves the Monuments Men, are in Europe and are traveling place to place looking for the stolen art. And it becomes apparent that the big key art piece they are looking for is the 'Madonna and Child' sculpture by Michelangelo himself.As they go from place to place, saving art, and mostly avoiding being killed by remaining Nazis, there is no real character camaraderie to help us enjoy the mission their on, other than it being a group of people making things difficult for the Nazis. If you're expecting a film with lots of gun fights, war scenes, and blood, than this is not the movie for you, as there is not any blood, nor is there one single nazi kill. It made me want to immediately watch Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds'. Instead, if we have one of our main guys face-to-face with a nazi with guns drawn, the scene ends happily with the two sharing a cigarette, a few laughs, and both sides going on their merry way. Clooney tries to add some very emotional moments dealing in barrels of gold teeth or some other reference to the holocaust, but it seems to on the nose, and not enough time is given to make the scene work.In fact, each scene never seems to have an end point, but rather just clumsily slides into the next. The dialogue at times is very cheesy and silly too, and in no way works in this film, which tries to be half comedy and half drama. Perhaps one of the worst things about 'Monuments Men' is its score. Alexandre Desplat supplied the score here, which he has some impressive work under his belt, but here, he completely missed the mark at every turn. Instead of receiving a score that would add suspense or make us feel some sort of emotion, we got a score that sounds very similar to HBO's 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'.It was all very silly and slap-sticky. It completely takes you out of the element. Especially in the last scene of the film, which is a blatant rip off from 'Saving Private Ryan'. It is laughable, and not in a good way. 'Monuments Men' has a great story and a great cast, but missed the mark on just about every level. This movie could have been much better if someone else took the reigns from the get-go. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this. Instead, wait for this to air on cable before you enjoy.",3,2,3,22 August 2015
Captain Phillips," 'Captain Phillips' is one hell of a fine film and reminds us why we all love Tom Hanks. Great picture.
","Tom Hanks is back out on the water again with Paul Greengrass' 'Captain Phillips', the true story that was covered in the media a few years ago, where cargo ship captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) and his crew were attacked by Somali pirates off the coast of Africa during a delivery, and where Phillips was actually taken hostage in a tony life boat for a few days. As there have been several survival movies coming out as of recently, this one in particular can sit high with the rest of them, as Greengrass and Hanks do exceptional work and keep this two-hour long suspenseful film on the edge of your seat. I expect high box office returns for this outing as Hanks and the plot will drive people to theaters this weekend.I was a little worried that 'Captain Phillips' would be an eye sore as Greengrass is known for his quick and jerky cuts from his 'Bourne' movies, but I can happily say, that those obnoxious angles and edits have been left out. The film opens up with the good captain saying goodbye to his family as he is about to embark on a little trip to haul tons of food, medicine, water, and other goods to Africa. However, his big cargo ship and crew of about 20 workers have to go through some unprotected waters to reach their destinations.Phillips is a no non-sense guy and is always on top of his staff in doing their jobs. He knows the score and has been around the block a few times. He knows that he is going into these dangerous waters and even sets ups drills in case his ship is attacked by Somali pirates, who we have come to know in the news as desperate poor civilians in an anarchist country whose only means of making money is to kidnap and hold ransom foreign boats and captains for large sums of money, so that thy can pay off their evil bosses and possibly eat the next day. As Phillips and his crew are just out to sea, a large group of Somalis are standing beach-front and being recruited and heavily armed to take two small boats and attack the incoming large ships in hopes of a big financial score.These Somalis must only weigh 115 pounds at the most and can't be over the age of 25. It seems that one of the groups that is recruited is led by a guy named Muse (Bakhad Abdi), who doesn't want to hurt anyone, but just survive. As Captain Phillips is running a drill for an attack, he notices two small boats racing toward his large boat and a real attack is underway. Phillips does everything he can to prevent these pirates from boarding their ship, but due to the ship's largeness, it can't turn or move fast, and the pirates soon dodge the large fire hoses and are aboard a ship of over 20 crew who have no weapons.Phillips instructs his crew to hide in the engine room and keep out of sight as Muse calls Phillips 'Irish' from now on and demands money. After a bit of stalling and taking the pirates around the ship, Phillips gives in and gives Muse the $30k that is on the ship in cash. However some of the other pirates who have a super hot temper believe that if they kidnap Phillips, they will get an even bigger payday. As the navy and military have been alerted and are on their way, the pirates and crew have a standoff, but the pirates have the upper-hand here and take Phillips away in a dingy lifeboat, which they hope to make it to Somalia in under two days.Soon, the military, helicopters, Navy Seals, and several warships are tailing the little enclosed lifeboat, as tensions keep building on both sides. Muse often reminds Phillips that he is just a simple fisherman looking to survive and is not out to hurt anyone, but the same cannot be said for the other three pirates in the lifeboat who are constantly beating Phillips. In the big climax of the film, we again come to realize why Tom Hanks is one of the best actors in the business. We all know how it turned out in real life, Phillips was rescued, but what Hanks gave as a performance, is nothing short of perfection in the final ten minutes.His shock and terror of what had happened to him is simply stunning. He is speechless, silent, and only mumbling incoherent questions as the nurse asks him who he is and does he know where he's at. You have to see these final minutes of this film, for they will truly stay with you for a while, and the hour and a half before it only builds that tension and release. Greengrass did a great job with this film as his camera took us to a claustrophobic setting where we the audience are trying to breathe and stay calm as our hero Phillips is. And the pirates all do a decent job, if not a clichéd job here and there, but it gets the job done. Note that the pirate in charge of driving the small life boat is constantly terrified.Henry Jackman's musical score amps up the suspense and keeps things moving. 'Captain Phillips' is one hell of a fine film and reminds us why we all love Tom Hanks. Great picture.",8,1,3,22 August 2015
The Equalizer," And while this remake of 'The Equalizer' might not have the depth and symbolism that 'Training Day' did, it certainly is a fun action film.
","This remake of an 80s television show about a retired CIA operative who now helps regular people in trouble has been in the works for quite some time. I believe it was always going to star the impressive Denzel Washington, but a few directors have been in and out of the director's chair including Nicolas Winding Refn ('Drive'). He bowed out a while ago and the studio asked Antoine Fuqua to helm the project, which he accepted. Fuqua worked with Washington on the Oscar winning film 'Training Day', which also earned Washington an acting Oscar.That movie was a raw and gritty film about a couple of police detectives working the mean streets of Los Angeles. It had many layers of depth and character development alongside it's violent action scenes. Well don't go into 'The Equalizer' expecting that. Instead, go in expecting a 90's Nic Cage type of action film complete with slow motion shots of Denzel walking away from big explosions. The only thing that was missing were John Woo's white doves flying out into the sky when Fuqua turned up the action beats. That's not to say this movie is bad in any way shape or form. It isn't. In fact, it's quite good and entertaining if you walk in expecting a fun action movie with Denzel kicking all sorts of ass.We meet Denzel's character Robert McCall as he is heading to work at his job at a Home Depot type place as a general employee. He is a nice and fun guy around his co-workers, and even tries to help them out in life when he can. He spends his evenings at a local diner, reading novels, eating pie, and watching the local vagrants come in on their break. One of them is Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a prostitute who is constantly being beat by her johns and pimp/Russian mob underboss. Well, Robert won't stand for this aggression, and tries to make sure this doesn't happen again, but when Teri ends up in the hospital die to a severe beating, Robert heads over to the pimp who did this and we see Robert turn into a super soldier of sorts who brutally takes out five guys in under a minute.Once the higher ups in the Russian mob hear about this, Robert is forced to start taking out all assassins that are trying to get to him. He even enlists the help of his former colleagues at one point with cameos from Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo, which give a backstory to Robert's past and how important he was to the USA. Everything culminates back at Robert's workplace, the Home Depot, where all hell breaks loose as RObert sets these insane and violent traps around the store for his attackers.This is a straightforward action film with all the genre beats that come with it, twists and all. Denzel is 59 years old, but man he kicks ass like a healthy 25 year old. It's brutal, raw, and unrelenting. And while this remake of 'The Equalizer' might not have the depth and symbolism that 'Training Day' did, it certainly is a fun action film that is thrilling and highly entertaining.",6,0,0,12 August 2015
War Dogs," Don't go to war over 'War Dogs'!
","'War Dogs' looks good on paper and the trailer for the film sells the movie's comedy and fun moments. It seemed like the perfect project for director Todd Phillips ('The Hangover' trilogy, 'Road Trip', 'Old School') as he reunites with Bradley Cooper and adds Jonah Hill and Miles Teller to this story, based on true events about two school friends who love to smoke up and run guns for the government – some of which might be illegal. This is a very different film for Phillips from what we're used to, and unlike the trailer, the film isn't all that funny. Sure, there are some moments of small laughter here and there, due to Jonah Hill's character, but the rest is Phillips' wink to a mix of gangster movies, including 'Scarface', 'Goodfellas', 'Casino', and even a bit of 'Drive'.That sounds good on paper, but the end result was lackluster with the 115 minute movie seeming like a three hour endeavor. The pacing is off and one scene just seems to be a repetition of the one before it. 'War Dogs' tells the true story of Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who were high school friends, who eventually got a government contract to supply weapons to the U.S. Army in Afghanistan with no prior experience and being in their early 20s. This film of course has a bunch of fictionalized elements, which is good, but never has anything original or fresh.Perhaps the best scene of the film is in the trailer, where Diveroli (Jonah Hill) and Packouz (Miles Teller) are riding in the truck in the Iraq desert, being chased by people with guns. That scene was funny, action-packed, and highly entertaining. Unfortunately the rest of the film is fairly drab with some flashes of funny Jonah Hill moments. Phillips sure packed the film with winks and nods to the gangster movies I mentioned above with the same music, shots, and narration style that you see in Scorsese films. Plus, there are 'Scarface' posters everywhere in the film, along with references to the actual movie by name. I just got tiresome very fast.It's an interesting enough story to tell, but the characters aren't that redeeming nor are they that likable throughout, particularly Jonah Hill's character, who he plays the part perfectly. Teller is also great, but isn't given much to work with. Bradley Cooper shows up for a few seconds here and there, but again, isn't given much time to really explore his character, who turns out to be the most interesting part of the movie. 'War Dogs' looks good from a technical and visual standpoint, but there really isn't anything underneath that veil.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!",5,1,1,23 January 2017
Iron Man 3," 'Iron Man 3′ is a great addition to the Marvel universe, and might be the best 'Iron Man' film yet.
","Since 'Iron Man 2' proved to be less than stellar back in 2010, this third adventure for the Marvel hero returns with a much-needed boost of attitude and character. 'Iron Man 3′, which can be also considered a sequel to ''The Avengers', takes us through many twists and turns and tons of new Iron Man suits. Director Shane Black tosses away some of the wham-bam action to focus on the quick-witted humor and our hero's internal struggle with crippling panic attacks. I have no doubt that this will be a fan favorite of the franchise and will light up the box office something fierce.Jon Favreau serves only as producer this time, but appears as his recurring character Happy Hogan. It's known that Favreau turned the opportunity down to direct this new sequel (as well as 'The Avengers') due to creative differences with Marvel. Shane Black is famous for writing the screenplays for 'Lethal Weapon', 'The Monster Squad' and 'The Long Kiss Goodnight'. He made his directorial debut in 2005 with the wonderful modern noir 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang', starring Robert Downey. Jr.As we've seen in his previous scripts, Black has an uncanny talent for writing stories with serious situations and characters, while at the same time being silly and over- the-top. The formula works, and is perfect for a comic book movie like 'Iron Man 3′. Tony Stark continues to belt out cynical remarks and make us laugh, even in the most diabolical situations. This cross between seriousness and sarcasm seems to be a trait of every character, particularly Stark and Rhodes (Don Cheadle), who both show their much different sides in and out of their respective suits.We start out with Stark narrating a past event from New Years Eve in 1999, where he attended a party in Switzerland with fellow scientist Maya (Rebecca Hall). They run into the odd and clingy Aldrich Killian (an unrecognizable Guy Pearce), who wants to talk with them about something new he has developed. In perfect Stark fashion, he stands Killian up for a one-night stand. We cut to present day at the Stark mansion in Malibu, where Stark has not been sleeping and spends his nights tinkering with his Iron Man gear.Meanwhile, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the head lady in charge of Stark Industries. Head of security Happy Hogan (Favreau) follows her around and makes things run almost too smoothly. Stark himself can't be bothered with any of the bad news in the world. He's too preoccupied with his panic attacks and fumbling with new Iron Man related projects. Even mass bombings around the world and the hacking of the world-wide television networks by a bin Laden-type terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) don't seem to phase Tony.As Pepper is at the office, a now handsome and suave Killian tries to persuade Stark Industries to team up for the old project he tried to get off the ground back in Switzerland. Pepper turns him down for reasons unexplained, but things seem a little off. Then, maybe hitting too close to home these days, a bomb goes off at the famous Hollywood Chinese Theater, killing a bunch of people. Amongst the victims is Happy Hogan. He's survived, but is badly injured.This sets Stark off, which leads the terrorists to show up at his mansion with a swarm of heavily armed helicopters that literally destroy everything. (It's not a spoiler if it's shown in all the trailers.) Tony regroups in Tennessee without any fancy gadgets or an Iron Man suit. For a good chunk of the film, he has to rely on his brains rather than his machines to fight back. He even has the help of a lonely kid (Ty Simpkins), as they slowly figure out what is causing these bombs and who's really behind this terrorist regime.This is my favorite Downey performance of any of the 'Iron Man' films. While still the same snide yet funny, charismatic yet somewhat offensive hero, Stark is forced to be the hero he has become without any of his usual money, technology or resources. In one scene, he reminded me of Batman, as he used his intelligence and bravery to scale a mansion and easily take out his foes. Then we have Stark being his brash self, who's not above calling a kid a pussy or threatening to run him over with his car. Downey just owns both Stark and Iron Man. I believe this was the role he was born to play.Cheadle is also great as Rhodes this second time around. He gives more depth and insight into both sides of his character, Rhodey on the one hand and War Machine on the other. Pearce shines here too. I haven't seen him do such a great job since 'Memento'. Kingsley looks like he had a ball with this role. Every time he appears on screen, I yearned for more. Paltrow has much more screen time in this sequel, and we finally get a glimpse into her relationship with Tony.It's truly great to see Tony Stark rise to the occasion without the suit and deal with the deep-seated issues that have plagued him since the beginning. The script is witty, funny and smart, with brilliant and memorable performances from everyone. The film has some stellar action scenes on land and in the air that will leave you on the edge of your seat, drenched in sweat and wanting to see more.In true Marvel fashion, stick around until after the final credits scroll to witness a few more minutes that are quite amusing. 'Iron Man 3′ is a great addition to the Marvel universe, and might be the best 'Iron Man' film yet.",8,14,22,23 August 2015
John Wick," This movie pulls out all of the stops and is one of the most entertaining action films of recent memory and Keanu Reeves as always is a badass and great on film.
","It's been a long while since we've received a balls out action movie that works on every level. Luckily for us, filmmakers Chad Stahelski and David Leitch have concocted one hell of a brutal, fun, and highly entertaining action film, starring the man, the myth, the legend Keanu Reeves. If you've been bored with your action movie choices as of lately, don't worry, 'John Wick' is the ultimate action flick of the year. Sure, it's a story that you've seen many times before, and I'm sure you'll see many times after this one, but 'John Wick' is filmed so well, has great performances, and is as brutal as you would hope in a gut wrenching action film, that you'll leave the theater fully satisfied and wanting a 'John Wick' franchise.I know I did. Life is not good for John Wick (Keanu Reeves), a retired hit-man for the Russian mafia who has gone straight, and is leading a normal quiet life with his beautiful wife. Unfortunately, John's wife tragically dies and is left all alone with his new puppy to help him through this tough time. A few days after his wife's funeral, some criminals break into his house, steal his car, and make John's life go from bad to worse. Not knowing who John is, these criminals are in for some severe consequences as the head Russian puts it, 'John Wick isn't the boogeyman, he's the guy you send to kill the boogeyman.'From here, Wick is on a path of destruction as he goes through bad guy after bad guy to kill the people who stole his car and took away the thing that meant most to him. And man, Wick is unrelenting as he is a skilled martial artist and professional gun handler. He can take out any person or obstacle that gets in his way. And the directors do a perfect job of not cutting every three seconds so that we can get a long good glimpse at the excellent fight choreography so we can see the scenes play out and the stuntmen and actors perform their skills.On top of that, it's a lot of fun with some great lines of dialogue that will muster up some laughs throughout. 'John Wick' isn't a silly film by any means though. It's raw, tough, and has some of the best shot action scenes in a very long time. You'll feel every hit, shot, and kick full on, leaving you glad you weren't there in person to get a swift kick to the face.This movie pulls out all of the stops and is one of the most entertaining action films of recent memory and Keanu Reeves as always is a badass and great on film.",10,2,7,12 August 2015
Gravity," If 'Gravity' was the last movie I saw before I died, I would die happy.
","If 'Gravity' was the last movie I saw before I died, I would die happy. This is hands down, the best film of the year so far, and quite possibly the best film of the last several years. Alfonso Cuaron has come back with a vengeance after a seven year hiatus. Cauron directed 'Children of Men' and the third 'Harry Potter' film to name a couple. I know all of you have seen the trailer for this film, and let me just say, you're in the for the most thrilling ride of your life.Not since Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' has space been so beautifully photographed. 'Gravity' is not - I repeat, NOT a science fiction film. It's a survival story of man (George Clooney) and a woman (Sandra Bullock) trying to get back to Earth by any means necessary after a catastrophic accident happens just above Earth as they are fixing a new satellite. There are no aliens, futuristic space crafts, or fancy weapons. Just the regular NASA gear. This short highly intense 90 minute film will leave you on the edge of your seat, your mouth open, your eyes watery, and your mind blown with questions like 'How did they do that?'George Clooney plays a veteran astronaut named Matt Kowalksy who likes Hank Williams Jr. and telling wild stories to his past to Houston down below. He is the pilot of the rocket ship while scientist Ryan Stone (Bullock) is fixing a problem on the satellite. However, the Russians launched a missile at one of their own failing satellites, which has caused the debris to collide with other satellites and space stations that has caused a giant spread of debris traveling around Earth faster than a bullet, and it's headed right for Kowalsky and Stone.Of course, the worst happens, and now the surviving two members of this mission are without a shuttle back to Earth and must get back to Earth somehow before their oxygen in their suits runs out. Through drifting through space without hooked on to anything, to colliding with other space stations, things are highly terrifying for the pair of astronauts.The film centers mostly on Bullock as she has only had six months of astronaut training and has to figure out how to navigate ships, put out fires in space, and come to terms that she might not make it back home. There are a few very emotional moments with her, where we completely feel how scared she is. And Cuaron's camera never misses anything, let alone has more than 12 edits in the entire movie. Hell, the first 30 minutes of the film are all one continuous shot, and it will truly take your breath away.Clooney is very charming in this role as he is in every role and does a flawless job, but Bullock really shines here as she shows every emotion we would all go through in a horrible situation like this one. I have no doubt that she will be nominated for an Oscar for this role, and if she wins, well she deserves it.The effects are some of the best effects I've ever seen on screen. I honestly can't tell if they actually shot the film in space above Earth with real space crafts, or if there was any use of special effects. It's that good. Of course there are special effects, but you will never be able to tell. Every shot of the film, could be paused and framed, and put up in an art gallery. It's that beautiful.And if you see this movie, which I highly suggest you do, see it in IMAX 3D. Yes, I said 3D. I am not a fan at all of 3D, but 'Gravity' has the best 3D effects and picture I have ever seen in a film thus far. If every film that said it was 3D, was this good, I would be a fan of 3D. Steven Price composed this monumental score for 'Gravity' that will truly terrify you and make your hairs stand on end. It's the perfect and unrelenting score for a film like this.If you see one movie for the rest of the year, make it 'Gravity'. It's the perfect film.",10,3,6,22 August 2015
Lone Survivor," This intense and gritty true account of the failed mission of a Navy SEALs raid in Afghanistan packs a strong punch.
","Rounding out the end of the year is yet another survival story with Peter Berg's 'Lone Survivor'. This intense and gritty true account of the failed mission of a Navy SEALs raid in Afghanistan packs a strong punch, even though you know only one person makes it out alive like the title suggests. The real life Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell is are lone survivor here, and we can compare this film to plenty other movies that take place in the Middle East where a mission has gone wrong, but Berg pulls out all of the stops with this story, and not only gives us an hour and a half of sheer brutality, but also gives us some great character camaraderie and tender moments to connect with these honorable soldiers. With the amount of movies out this holiday weekend, I don't see this one trumping the box office, but might make a medium-sized dent.We all know that the Navy SEALs are the cream of the crop and the best of the best in keeping our great country safe. These soldiers are the best equipped, the most trained for the most difficult situations, and for most of the time, get the job done, if not every time. But once in a blue moon, something goes wrong. Back in 2005, four SEALs, Lt. Mike Murphy (Taylor Kitsch), Petty Officer 1st Class Marcus Latrell (Mark Wahlberg), and Petty Officers 2nd Class Danny Dietz and Matt Axelson (Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster) were tasked with a mission to be dropped off in the rural mountains of Afghanistan by helicopter, and had to trek around the rocky terrain until the came upon a village where a high ranking member of the Taliban and Bin Laden's right hand man was hiding out, and killed dozens of marines for breakfast earlier in the week. The task was to take this guy out and his soldiers, which upon arrival and looking through their binoculars at the village, the amount of Taliban members were much greater than anticipated.The mission heats up quickly when an old man and two young kids stumble across the SEALs, and there in lies a conflict of ethics. One of the young kids seems to be the next member of the Taliban, as he seems to not cooperate with the SEALs at all. Now the elite squad must make a decision of whether to kill them or set them free. After an intense discussion, they decide to let them free in fear of going to jail for war crimes, but shortly thereafter, the SEALs become in a horrific battle with Taliban members that seems to not stop. In video game like fashion, the bad guys keep coming with bigger and better weapons including a rocket launcher. But this is no video game, but real life and death.Berg does a great job showing the physical aspects of the soldiers and their tough and tragic situation. As bullets, explosions, and debris literally rip the flesh off our soldiers and blood continually pours out, we feel every hit, bullet entry, and fall these soldiers take. And I think Berg is the best in the business at filming characters falling down cliffs and mountains,as we saw in his film 'The Rundown' with The Rock. Berg tends to slow down the film as these character fall to the hard rocky ground, and speed up to normal pace at the moment of impact with a branch, rock, or tree, and with a loud and intense crunch or pop sound, we feel every painful hit. There is no shortage of these scenes here.Despite Wahlberg being 42 years old, and the character he played was not even 30 in real life, he definitely pulls off a young soldier very well. Never at one point did I think he was too old for the role. That goes the same for the other three, even Kitsch. Their friendship and camaraderie at the beginning of the film is incredible, and you just know these guys will never let the other down, as I know that Berg and some of the other actors went through some of the actual training the SEALs go through.This is one of Berg's best films and is loads better than his recent effort of 'Battleship'. With Steve Jablonsky's impressive score, and some great acting and physical performances by these actors, this ultra-bloody and tragic story is one for the ages and won't be soon forgot. The film let's us know that some of these situations that are portrayed happen everyday over in the Middle East, and it made me glad that we have people like the SEALs and good people overseas who are willing to take out the evil that is the Taliban.",8,0,1,22 August 2015
Fury," 'Fury' is an ultra-violent and bloody war film and is a solid entry into the WWII genre, however it almost imploded on itself at the end, leaving a bitter taste.
","When Brad Pitt signs up to kill Nazis in a WWII movie, you say, 'YES'. This particular movie is called 'Fury', and is a solid, very good war film. It's brutal, violent, raw, and has enough of a fresh feel to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire 134-minute runtime. Instead of being out in the open, walking the fields of France or another nazi occupied country, 'Fury' takes place mostly inside a small steel tank with five guys led by 'Wardaddy' (Pitt), during the final month of WWII. The claustrophobia sets in quickly and gives us an ample amount of time to dig deep into each soldier inside the tank.Writer-director David Ayer is known for his cop drama films, ('End of Watch', 'Sabotage', 'Street Kings', and 'Training Day') to name a few. And he pulls from his past work to take on the fierceness of this merciless story of a squad of U.S. tanks, winning the war against the Germans. It's a story you won't soon forget, yet in the final moments of the film, Ayer pulls a stunt that almost ruins everything that came before it. Despite that horrible aspect, 'Fury' is quite good.Wardaddy is a tank commander with the 2nd Armored Division who has been around for quite a few wars. He's a seasoned soldier, rough, tough, and has seen it all. However, there is something deeper inside him going on that shows us there's more to him than just being a nazi killing machine like we saw in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds'. But his sheer barbaric ways show when he initiates a newcomer named Norman (Logan Lerman), a young kid who is a trained typist for the army, who is literally thrown into Wardaddy's tank as an assistant driver, even though Norman has never seen the inside of a tank. Wardaddy forces Norman to shoot a captured S.S. Officer point blank in the head, and that will be the first of many things Norman is forced to do over the course of this movie.The other soldiers inside 'Fury', which is painted on the tank's gun barrel are Boyd (Shia LaBeouf), a rough solider who is also super religious, Trini (Michael Pena), the driver with a drinking problem, and Grady (Jon Bernthal), the aggressive red neck jerk of the highest level. These seem like stereotypes, but I can assure you, Ayer has written them with a good amount of depth, particularly LaBeouf's character who hasn't been this good in anything for many years. As the war is coming to a quick end and as the Nazis are still fighting to their last breath, the Americans are taking town by town, usually led by Wardaddy's tank unit.After the successful take over of a nazi occupied town, there is a moment for some down time where Wardaddy takes Norman under his wing and up to an apartment where a mother (Anamaria Marinca) and her teenage daughter (Alicia von Rittberg) come face to face with the two U.S. soldiers. They are terrified at first, but Wardaddy puts them at ease, and the women end up making a meal and drinks for the two soldiers. This might be the best scene in the film as we get a small glimpse at someone who has been through hell and seen such horrible atrocities, still trying to have a normal life of routine and genuine pleasantries. But war is terrible, and this nice situation doesn't last long as the rest of Wardaddy's crew heads up to the apartment and ruins this seemingly nice setting. It's not their fault really, but it's rather what the war and the stuff they had to do to survive and win has done to them, turning them into animals.The climactic scene doesn't seem to make any sense as the Captain of the unit tells Wardaddy and a few other tanks go on a big mission to stop a treasure trove of Nazis that are headed to a certain location. Even though the war is quickly coming to an end, and this mission doesn't seem to have much of a reason, it's unclear why the captain would send these great soldiers on what seems like a suicide mission. And this we are in the steel tank again as our soldiers fight a never-ending stream of nazi soldiers. But again, Ayer pulls this wild card out of his back pocket, that completely negates anything that came before it, and almost destroys his own film.Pitt is great in his role and gives a few layers of depth to his brute soldier character. Lerman ('The Perks of Being a Wallflower') plays the newbie who is forced to hold a gun and kill any German soldier he faces very nicely. And the rest of the crew turn in amazing performances as well. The set pieces, uniforms, and tanks all add to the realistic setting of 1945 Germany. And Ayer's direction keeps you on edge, particularly during one of the tank battle sequences. 'Fury' is an ultra-violent and bloody war film and is a solid entry into the WWII genre, however it almost imploded on itself at the end, leaving a bitter taste.",8,12,21,12 August 2015
The Maze Runner," 'The Maze Runner' might not be your go-to young adult film, but it is definitely thrilling and highly entertaining with some decent reveals in the third act.
","To end the summer and start the fall season, we have yet another Young Adult film adaptation from James Dashner's book series called 'The Maze- Runner'. Like the young adult movies to come out before this one such as 'The Giver', 'Divergent', and even 'The Hunger Games', it all takes place in the a futuristic society where Earth is mostly in ruins. And there is one person who might be able to set things straight and save a bunch people and bring peace. 'The Maze-Runner' is no different when it comes to these plot points.While 'The Hunger Games' is still one of the better made and looking films of this caliber, 'The Giver' and 'Divergent' fall in the 'less than thrilling category' if you get what I'm saying. Fortunately, director Wes Ball has conjured up a great cast of young adults and has shot a fast-paced action thriller that keeps us entertained and at times, on the edge of our seat. But with it's fast pace, the character development of some of the supporting characters is left in the gutter. But it doesn't seem to matter, because Ball has stylishly filmed the action scenes that we forget about any of the misgivings this movie has.We open our eyes and see a teenage guy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) who awakens in a steel cage elevator and arrives in the Glade, which is in the center of The Maze. Thomas is greeted by dozens of other boys who have came up there before him along with much needed supplies. The Glade is a big open field surrounded by woods and meadows and is enclosed by a giant concrete wall, which at night changes itself so it's a different Maze the next day. Alby (Aml Ameen) is the Glade's first prisoner and has been there the longest, which is three years, who gives Thomas a crash course on what they know, which isn't much because all of the boys seems to have some sort of amnesia where they can't remember their past other than their names.Alby and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) head up the leader faction of the Glade, while Gally (Will Poulter) leads up the security portion of it. Other factions include farming and food, and building weapons and shelter. Then there are the most respected faction amongst the boys - the runners. The runners leave each morning and run as far as they can through the Maze to map out an escape route or find out why they are there in the first place. However, they must be back before each night, because the walls change and the scary-as-hell Grievers come out, which are giant spider like creatures that are half organic and half robot (it's scarier than it sounds).Thomas is learning the tricks of the trade very quickly, which some like and some don't - mainly Gally who is trying to keep things as they are and not wanting to upset the Maze. But when the arrival of the first girl ever comes up the elevator by the name of Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), things get tense quickly. Not only is she throwing off the balance and peace of the other guys, but her strange connection to Thomas makes the others think something bad is coming for them. But soon enough, Thomas leads a band of people through the Glade in order to find a real way out and maybe they'll find out why they were put here in the first place.The movie suffers a little bit from some of the cheesy dialogue from the co-stars. It could have been better if there was a little more backstory to the characters, but some of this comes off as rushed and therefor some of the dialogue doesn't always work. What does work are the action scenes. They are top notch that will keep you on the edge of your seat. They are choreographed very well and keep the film's pace moving along. And the actors here all turn in great performances that are very believable. 'The Maze Runner' might not be your go-to young adult film, but it is definitely thrilling and highly entertaining with some decent reveals in the third act. After watching this first film, I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel.",7,0,0,12 August 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 'Rogue One' goes all the way!
","Since the release of 'The Force Awakens', Disney will be releasing a 'Star Wars' film every year for the foreseeable future. Well, it's been a year since 'The Force Awakens', which means it's time for another 'Star Wars' film, and luckily for us, we get 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'. I'm so glad that Disney is allowing up and coming, young filmmakers a chance to have a go at 'Star Wars', because director Gareth Edwards ('Monsters' and 'Godzilla') has knocked it out of the park, even though there were some re-shoots with writer Tony Gilroy ('Michael Clayton' and 'The Bourne' films). This is the 'Star Wars' film we have wanted for a long time, in that we get to see some characters do some truly amazing and badass things that we've never seen before, and a return to some of those classic set pieces and ships.'Rogue One' takes place in between 'Episode III' and 'Episode IV'. We all know that the original Star Wars film 'A New Hope' focused on Luke Skywalker destroying the Death Star, by way of stolen plans that Princess Leia entrusted to R2-D2 that instructed how to destroy that mega Death Star. We know how that turned out. 'Rogue One' tells the story of how and who stole those plans from the Empire and got them to the Rebellion. I don't want to give too much away here, because I know all of you will just fall in love with these characters.Every performance is excellent here from Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso to Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, and even Forest Whitaker as fan favorite Saw Gerrera. Everyone gives a great performance of characters struggling to overcome the empire and deal with their past losses. Alan Tudyk ('Firefly') voices the new droid K-2SO, which might be my new favorite 'Star Wars' character of the whole canon. K-2SO is just plain fantastic and funny in a way that C3PO could never be. It was a delight. Mads Mikkelsen and Ben Mendelsohn are just straight up phenomenal and have many layers to their characters and steal each scene they are in.Then of course Donnie Yen comes in and just owns every scene and proves he is the badass he has always been. There is a great story in this 133 minute film that keeps its pace with some of the best action sequences you'll ever see involving spaceships and tie fighters. Michael Giacchino has done a phenomenal job of bringing John Williams' score to this film by adding in some of the old with the new, and it just adds to every scene and suspenseful and heartfelt moment.'Rogue One' is definitely one of the best 'Star Wars' films I've seen.MUST-SEE!",9,4,7,23 January 2017
This Is the End," 'This Is the End' is no doubt one of the year's funniest films so far.
","Car crashes, explosions, decapitations, exorcisms, the apocalypse and tons of dick jokes make up Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen's 'This Is the End' – and it's the most fun I've had at the movies in ten years. In this dark comedy, the entire Apatow gang plus many more cameos from popular comedians all play themselves as they take on the end of days. It's gut-bustingly funny, sick, crude and self-deprecating, played like a twisted Reality show, complete with solo interviews and cameras scattered throughout the movie. I anticipate a big opening with long-lasting power, even after 'Man of Steel' opens later this week.'This Is the End' takes it cues from a short film that Goldberg and Rogen made called 'Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse' that had virtually the same cast, but was never released publicly. It only ran two minutes and was very low-budget. This time around, they have a mega budget with visual effects on a grand scale, and the cast has more to work with. Our two main focus points are Rogen and Jay Baruchel, as Baruchel flies into Los Angeles to visit his long-time Canadian friend, Rogen, for the week. Out of the entire Apatow cast of actors, Baruchel still resides in Canada and has a serious disdain for the life in L.A.We get a funny glimpse of the lives of young, successful actors in Hollywood, complete with all of the drugs, booze and jokes to go with it. The affair takes place at James Franco's brand new home that he designed himself, as he is a man of many talents. His home is fit for a king and overlooks the Hollywood sign, just a block or two away from a shopping center. The first segment of the movie is packed with hilarious discussions and songs from this all-star comedy cast, including Mindy Kaling, Michael Cera, Rihanna, Emma Watson, Jason Segel,and Christopher Mintz- Plasse. At one point, we see Cera getting serviced by two girls at the same time, all the while Baruchel is less than thrilled to be there.As Rogen and Baruchel walk across the street to grab a pack of smokes and a snack, all hell breaks loose literally. There are explosions, fires, large holes in the ground opening up, cars crashing into people and buildings, and beams of light shooting out of the sky and lifting people up. All of Los Angeles is engulfed in flames and many of Franco's guests are killed or swallowed up by the giant holes. After the initial apocalyptic impact, only a few survivors are left inside Franco's mansion, including Franco, Rogen, Baruchel, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson. After they regroup, they go through their food, water and weapons (which amount to only a baseball bat and a prop gun from the movie 'Flyboys').After their first night, the survivors are awakened by Danny McBride, who wasn't invited to Franco's party but ended up passing out in his bathtub. McBride uses most of their rationed food to cook breakfast, completely unaware of what happened the night before. Soon after that, Emma Watson shows up to take refuge, but leaves quickly after overhearing the guys talking about a non-existent 'rapey' vibe. Now left with nothing liquid to drink, tensions run high and things get serious. McBride turns into a horrible houseguest who takes more rations than he should, whereas the rest of the group tries to come to terms with what has happened and figure out how to survive, or at least get into heaven. The results are a highly entertaining yet perverse thrill ride.A lot of the film seems to have a healthy dose of improv between the actors, mostly dealing with certain parts of the anatomy, drugs and sex. We also get their takes on religion and how worthy of being saved they think they are, which offers a little insight into the Hollywood elite and how they think. The film takes a couple of twists and turns into demonic possession territory, followed by a monster movie. It all works if you don't take it seriously.The entire cast turn in solid gold performances and do what they do best, which is provide great comedy. I laughed from start to finish, even if some of the jokes are far-fetched or straight-up disgusting. 'This Is the End' is no doubt one of the year's funniest films so far. It will be difficult for any comedy to top what Rogen and Goldberg have delivered. I can't wait to see this again.",9,3,6,23 August 2015
World War Z," 'World War Z' may not be the perfect story or character-driven movie we wanted it to be, but its incredible action sequences and suspenseful situations deserve a look.
","We begin in downtown Philadelphia with retired United Nations investigator Gerry Lane (Pitt), his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and their two young daughters. While they're stuck in heavy traffic, the zombie apocalypse hits the city with a vengeance. Within a matter of seconds, thousands of people have turned into bloodthirsty and incredibly fast-moving zombies. Gerry moves his family and calls his former boss to rescue them from a nearby housing project rooftop. They're taken to a temporary refuge aboard several naval ships anchored in the Atlantic Ocean.Things move very quickly, and not in a good way. It seems like everybody's first thought and first action is always the right one, and nothing is ever explained in full. For example, it's never explained why Gerry is the only man capable of stopping and solving the zombie outbreak; he just is. As Gerry embarks on a worldwide journey to find answers, his first stop is South Korea, where he meets a team of elite soldiers and scientists looking for solutions. Gerry only listens and follows the advice of a former operative who has been relegated to a prison cell for treason. This former operative informs him that North Korea has fixed the zombie outbreak by enforcing a mandatory teeth extraction from every citizen, but that he will find more answers in Israel.After a suspenseful attack, Gerry jets off to Jerusalem, where the city has erected a six-story concrete wall to keep out the undead. Inside this wall, life is back to normal, but as soon as Gerry arrives, the zombies somehow manage to climb the wall and destroy the city in a matter of minutes. This escape scene is pretty spectacular and frightening, even if aspects of it don't make sense at all. But that seems to be the theme of the movie so far. During the escape, Gerry comes across a wounded female solider named Segen (Daniella Kertesz), whom he takes on the last plane out of Israel. His contacts aboard the naval ship then tell him to head to Wales, where a medical research facility is still intact.When a scary incident forces their plane to make an emergency crash landing, Segen and Gerry stumble upon the facility where the climactic finale takes place. This is the segment of the film that the studio demanded be rewritten, reshot and re- edited many times over. Gerry and Segen, along with a couple of remaining scientists, have to navigate a maze-like research facility full of zombies to get hold of a certain solution that could perhaps put a stop to this zombie outbreak that has by now engulfed most of the world's population. These particular final moments are completely different in tone than what we've seen prior to this moment, by way of adding a slow and suspenseful situation, rather than the high-octane action scenes that came before. It's not a wrong decision, just a strange one. Then, as if the movie has no more budget or time left, everything gets wrapped up very quickly in a vague matter, but not before Brad Pitt takes a long cool drink of Pepsi.There are certain aspects to 'World War Z' that work very well. The zombies themselves are fairly frightening. They turn instantly after being bitten, and develop super strength and super speed to attack their prey. They hurl their bodies at full force, even off buildings, to attack. They twitch and move in ways that human bodies aren't made to move. As heavy as this movie is on action sequences, one would hope for some pretty incredible action beats. Luckily for us, the filmmakers deliver that on a silver platter. Never before have we witnessed a zombie epidemic on this grand a scale. From the helicopter shots that show literally hundreds of thousands of the undead running for food and biting people whenever they get a chance, to the intense zombie outbreak aboard a plane in mid-air, you're guaranteed to be on the edge of your seat. I only wish that the filmmakers had put this much effort into the characters or story.Pitt of course does an amazing job as the leading man. He's set on saving the world and is fully believable in such a position. The rest of the supporting cast aren't A- listers, but still do the job. I think we would have been taken out of the whole experience if the supporting cast was full of Academy Award winners. Kertesz sticks out as a fresh face who holds her own alongside Pitt. Sadly, gore fans will be sorely disappointed as there isn't a drop of blood or any decent flesh-eating scenes in the entire flick.One thing that I liked most about 'World War Z' is that, for the first time since '28 Days Later', I didn't fantasize about wanting to be in a zombie outbreak afterwards. Movies like 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Zombieland' make it seem like a fun and a wild ride to be involved in this sort of apocalyptic situation. But with this flick, I found myself scared to even think of such a worldwide infection happening. Instead of watching people kill zombies in unusual and creative ways, we mostly see people running from them and unable to defend themselves, even with the most dangerous weapons. It gives the movie a realistic aspect that is all too horrifying.'World War Z' may not be the perfect story or character-driven movie we wanted it to be, but its incredible action sequences and suspenseful situations deserve a look, despite all of the film's flaws.",7,0,3,23 August 2015
42," '42' is a very good movie and will definitely have an impact on and inspire many people, especially the younger crowd.
","'42', which is the answer to the ultimate question in the universe, is also that historic and legendary uniform number held by Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play major league baseball. Brian Helgeland's biopic film on Robinson tells a polished and engaging version of the baseball hero that changed the nation. With phenomenal performances from Chadwick Boseman as Robinson himself, both fans of baseball and Robinson, along with a younger crowd who has never heard of the baseball player will eat this film up. The box office will draw some decent money, even if the director tries to head us over the head with what we are supposed to be feeling.We focus on the years 1945-1947 in '42' as we segue into last part of the film, which is Robinson's first year as an actual major league baseball player. Similar to the 1950 'Jackie Robinson Story' (where Robinson played himself), one of the vital scenes is where Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) asks Robinson if he has what it takes to keep a cool head while his teammates, fans, and opposing teams harass him because of the color of his skin. And that is one of the main reasons Robinson was a hero. Not only did he impress everyone on the baseball field, but he showed great courage and restraint against his aggressors.Rickey, maybe a man before his time, but certainly wanting to make a difference in the world socially and racially, hires Robinson to the Monteal Royals farm team, where we see Robinson taunted by his manager, teammates, going so far as to make him sleep separately from the team while on the road with a black family in town. But just like a good father, Rickey always says the right things at the right moments and has reminded Robinson to show his anger and voice on the field, rather than sink to the other's levels.On opening day in Jersey City, Robinson hits a powerful home-run to which his manager says, 'He might be superhuman after all.' Now that piece of dialogue wasn't necessary, but the film is riddled with instances like this. Rather than have the character's actions tell the story on their own, there is always some piece of dialogue to punch in this face to tell us exactly what we need to feel. That is this film's flaw, which isn't a huge problem, but is annoying as it happens too often.We do get a fair share of the racism that was hurdled towards Robinson throughout the film as we see his own teammates signing petitions to not play with him and specifically an obnoxious manager named Ben Chapman (Alan Tudyk) who pitches the n-word and every other slang term at the ball player. However, all of these terrible moments for Robinson are almost immediately redeemed by some form of just punishment in the form of a victory or great play. On the other end of the spectrum, Robinson has a few supporters of integrating races in sports, such as manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni) and a couple of colleagues, who all try to make it easier and help out Robinson.With the use of some CG work, some of the baseball fields and stadiums looked amazing as if the cast and crew were really in the 40s making a baseball film. The wardrobe and settings are spot on. Harrison Ford does a good job as Rickey, however his character seems to only go one direction, which is the father figure who doles out good advice. It's a good performance, but not much depth there. Tudyk and Meloni turn in great performances when they are on screen. And I was very happy to see John C. McGinley play Red Barber, the radio announcer. McGinley, mostly known as Dr. Cox on 'Scrubs' does an amazing job of being very animated and a lot of fun.And Boseman shines as the celebrated Robinson. Not only is he a plausible athlete, but his charm and dramatic sense of keeping his anger at bay, shows off his acting chops, which he has plenty of. Since Robinson had really nobody to talk to about his difficult times during this period in his life other than his wife, I would have though that his spouse would have had a more prominent role in the film, but that's not the case. I would have liked to see a bit more of their relationship, if only to see Robinson's escape from all of the hatred.'42' is a very good movie and will definitely have an impact on and inspire many people, especially the younger crowd. Robinson's story is a great one to tell, and here, it's told with grace and class. Even if Helgeland wanted to make a lighter film on such a sore and controversial subject, '42' is still a home-run.",7,0,0,2 September 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," 'Star Trek into Darkness' has tons of twist and turns and is on the highest level of entertainment.
","I must admit that when I walked into the crowded theater to watch J.J. Abrams' second journey into the 'Star Trek' universe, I was a bit apprehensive. The studio didn't hold any press screenings before the film was released on Wednesday. For some reason, the actual press screening was one hour later than the regular screening for paying audiences. Usually, studios do this when they know they have a terrible movie on their hands and don't want negative reviews published before opening day. Would that be the case here, or did Abrams simply want to keep the film's many secrets under wraps until it was released?I'll avoid specific spoilers in this review, and will try to talk more or less in generalities. First and foremost, know that I loved 'Star Trek into Darkness'. Abrams has conjured an action-packed thrill ride of a sequel with just enough heart to appease new fans of the franchise as well as old school Trekkies. I have no doubt that this will be one of the most successful films of the year, and won't be surprised if Paramount announces a third entry in the next few weeks.'Star Trek into Darkness' still takes place in Abrams' alternate 'Trek' timeline, established in his first film, but he continues to link the two continuities here as well. One of the things I love most about this sequel is that it's a story about how Kirk and Spock's friendship evolves. In this reboot of the franchise, we haven't seen Spock and Kirk become the friends that we know they'll be. Kirk is still young, cocky and brave, while Spock struggles with his half-Vulcan and half-human sides. These two Starfleet officers do not mix.Things start out with Kirk, McCoy and Spock on a primitive alien planet as a very large volcano is about to annihilate the entire landscape and its inhabitants. With this intense situation, Kirk does what he does best, by acting rogue and unwilling to follow the rules. Spock, of course, uses logic rather than emotion to accomplish the same task. From this, we see what their relationship is and what it could be. Later, Kirk is relieved of his Captain rank due to his insubordination, and is replaced by Commander Pike, who demotes him to First Officer.Meanwhile, a huge terrorist explosion destroys a bunch of buildings and kills a lot of people on Earth. At a Starfleet meeting led by Admiral Marcus (Peter 'RoboCop' Weller), we learn that a man named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) is behind the bombing and has escaped to a far off, supposedly uninhabitable Klingon planet. The Enterprise is sent to capture him. However, there's much more to this story and Harrison than meets the eye.Abrams focuses more directly on the duo of Kirk and Spock this time around. While we have some good moments with other characters, they don't have much screen time and mostly serve for comic relief, which is done flawlessly and works in great references to the original films and TV show. And if you thought that the previous movie had a ton of action sequences and spectacular visual effects, you're in for a treat with this sequel, which turns the action up to Eleven.Cumberbatch really shines here. You never know quite what to think about him, but he's truly a force to be reckoned with. Even though he's roughly the same size as everyone else in the film, he appears larger-than-life and is very terrifying. Quinto and Pine turn in stellar performances as well. This is maybe some of their best work to date, as we see both men struggle with their flaws and their friendship. I believe that the true core of this sequel is almost a love story, but one between two friends who are destined to do great things.Simon Pegg as Scotty has his own separate mission and is a key part of the movie. The humor he brings is much-needed and always welcome. Karl Urban never fails to impress as McCoy, the doctor who's always angry at something. It's amazing to see him flirt with some of the staff on the ship. Anton Yelchin's Checkov doesn't get a lot of screen time, but has a great scene involving his uniform. I believe Sulu (John Cho) will have a bigger role in upcoming films. In his brief time on screen, he demonstrates that he's capable of leading a starship. Zoe Saldana as Uhura serves as more of a comic relief role this time around. And of course Peter Weller puts his all on the table and is ruthless to a tee.I saw the movie in IMAX 3D. If you have the option to see this in IMAX, by all means do so. I truly felt like I was on the bridge of the Enterprise for the whole film. The sound was incredible. The 3D, however, is take-it-or-leave it. I didn't find it to be good or bad, just average. I would have much preferred to see the film in 2D.I can't wait until we have 'Star Trek' films where the Enterprise does what it's meant to do, which is go out into the beyond and explore new planets and life forms – to boldly go where no one has gone before. This isn't that movie, but I expect that the next one will be. 'Star Trek into Darkness' has tons of twist and turns and is on the highest level of entertainment. This is a remarkable sequel and I can't wait to see it again. This might be the most fun I'll have at the theater all year.",8,4,7,23 August 2015
The Babadook," 'The Babadook' is quite possibly the scariest film since Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'.
","If you've met me, you would instantly know that I'm one of the biggest advocates of the horror genre. I just have to get my hands on every horror title and at least view it once. No matter if it's a terrible B-movie, one that has a treasure trove of blood and entrails, or a slow burn psychological horror, I'm usually a fan of the horror genre in general. I love having nightmares more than the usual puppy dogs and ice cream dreams, and I love when a movie truly scares me so much so that I'm a bit frightened to walk down my dark hallway at night. I know it's a twisted mind set, and maybe it stems from my dad bringing me to see 'Aliens' at such a young age in the theater, but the horror genre is where I feel most at home.Now over the past decade or two, there have been only a few select movies that have actually scared me. Most of the horror films as of recently rely on standard horror beats to muster up cheap, fast scares that come across more silly and stupid than anything. It's that 'once in a blue moon' where a horror film does everything right. And that blue moon is 'The Babadook', which is an Australian horror film written and directed by actress Jennifer Kent. 'The Babadook' is quite possibly the scariest film since Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'. It's a story and film that will stay with you for days and keep you up in the middle of the night, scared to look out over the covers and walk alone down the dark hall in your home. It's not only one of the most frightening films I've ever seen, it's also a fairly endearing film too that shows the story of a single widowed mother of a young boy with an active imagination, and their struggle to keep a happy life.Sam (Noah Wiseman) and his widowed mom Amelia (Essie Davis) seemingly lead a happy life together and are still trying to pick up the pieces after Sam's dad died on the day of hi birth. Amelia used to be a successful writer, but now takes care of the elderly in a nursing home to make ends meet. Meanwhile, her lively young boy Sam is having difficulties making friends at school and spends his time making wood and steel catapults to fight invisible monsters. Amelia reads a bed time story to Sam every night before he goes to bed, but one night a strange book shows up called 'The Babadook'. It's written like a children's story complete with pop-ups, but the story is quite sinister that depicts a giant shadowy creature that lurks around you and your house at all times, never leaves, and will eventually kill you.Soon after she starts reading it to Sam, she realizes this is an evil book and tries to throw it away. Well of course the book shows up again and things start happening in the house to Sam and Amelia. Lights flicker, a strange and evil looking creature appear, one of the scariest voices echo through the house, and Sam and Emilia start to hallucinate. It's not a good situation. What makes 'The Babadook' so scary is it's character development between Sam and Amelia. You can tell there is a lot of love for each other there and they even make a pact to protect each other. By doing this, we feel very connected and attached to these people, and when evil starts to fly full circle, their transformations are even more terrifying.The creature itself is something straight from your worst nightmares and not something you would ever want to see in person, let alone your dreams. There is an aspect of 'The Shining' put into this story and Essie Davis plays this aspect pitch perfect. Her voice octave range, body language and expressions sell every emotion and action so realistically that she deserves an acting award. And Wiseman's performance as Sam is excellent as well. 'The Babdook' doesn't rely on CG effects, gore, or cheap scares.Every action and piece of dialogue is thoroughly thought out and executed, delivering one of the scariest films to ever grace the big screen. I can't wait to see this again and scare myself over and over.",10,4,8,11 August 2015
Don Jon," This is a good first film for Levitt, and he can only improve from here.
","In addition to starring, Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his debut as a writer/director with 'Don Jon'. At its core, the movie shows a simple man's transition from an unlikable sex-obsessed douche-bag into a somewhat friendlier human being capable of having meaningful relationships. The film is quite fun, but also often repetitive.Jon (Levitt) is a young man in his early 30s who bar-tends at a trendy night club in New Jersey. When he isn't working, he and his greased-back hair work out at the gym, meticulously clean his apartment, watch football with his two friends, and try to have sex with a different girl (who must always rank above an 8 on his hotness scale of 1-10) every day. As he narrates throughout the course of the film, he's very successful at this.Oh yes, there's one more thing. Jon is completely obsessed with watching porn, an activity he does more than once a day. He tells us that porn is and always will be better than the real thing. As he lists his many reasons for this, his speech is interspersed with actual porn footage. Jon has a bad temper too, and doesn't make friends other than his lifetime buds, who just want to see what hot girl he'll score with next.Then, Barbara (Scarlett Johannson) walks into the club, and of course she's a dynamite knockout from top to bottom. But then she speaks, and an unbelievable Jersey accent comes out and ruins everything – except to Jon, of course.Jon puts his best moves on Barbara, but she doesn't budge, at least for a while. She wants to be wined and dined over the course of a month or so first, and Jon is hell- bent on this conquest. However, he's never experienced love, and thinks that Barbara is the one, even though she manipulates him into doing things for her in return for sex. Everything comes to a head when she finds out about his porn obsession, which hasn't slowed down a bit since their exclusive dating. Barbara is so horrified by this that she screams, runs and never comes back.Jon attends school to become something more than a bartender. There, he meets Esther (Julianne Moore), an older widow who's a free spirit and takes a liking to him. She even figures out a way to get through to him about his selfish ways. She gives him a vintage '70s porn to watch, so that he can see the error of his ways and maybe change his thoughts on women and himself.Some of the best scenes in the movie take place at Jon's parent's house, during the weekly family dinners. His dad (Tony Danza) is not above cursing at everyone at the dinner table, and must have the football game on at all times, even when people are talking. Danza shines in this role and garners quite a few laughs.This is a good first film for Levitt, and he can only improve from here. He's brilliant as Jon shows his struggle between his two personalities. As a director, Levitt's camera-work won't win any awards. He tells the story straight, yet repeats himself often. On the other hand, the payoff is good enough in the end to make you glad that you watched the film.",7,1,2,22 August 2015
Fast & Furious 6," 'Fast & Furious 6′ is a ridiculous action spectacle that will garner more chuckles and applause for fan favorites than it delivers genuine thrills.
","With more than $1.5 billion in previous sales, Universal rolls out a sixth entry to one of its biggest film franchises this week. Despite awful dialogue and numerous over- the-top, zany action sequences that are more comical than suspenseful, 'Fast & Furious 6′ will probably push that amount even further. That being said, the movie delivers what its audience has wanted since the first entry. That is, all of the original actors are back this time, even Michelle Rodriguez. I have no doubt this will score big at the box office. At least, Universal seems to think so. The studio has already greenlit Part 7, which will be released next July and promises even more stars and bigger action.Director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan, who have immersed themselves in this fuel injected world for the last four films, have not let up with this one. It has to be difficult coming up with different and fresh situations for these characters to dive into movie after movie. Luckily for us, Lin and Morgan do a decent job here of not making us feel like we're watching the same thing over and over. This time around, instead of all the gun violence of previous entries, we receive a healthy dose of fight choreography, including MMA, wrestling and Thai martial arts. If it wasn't enough for the gang to race and chase exotic cars, Lin adds a giant military tank and large cargo aircraft to the mix. But with Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson all working together this time, there isn't anything they can't do, no matter how far- fetched the situation.As we have come to know these characters over the past twelve years, they come from modest means with a big criminal history. However, they scored $100 million in the last film, which led them to live lavish lives around the world. That changes when Hobbs (Johnson) shows up at Dom's (Diesel) new place on some remote island and asks to make a deal to help capture a criminal. In return, he and all his friends will be pardoned. The movie starts out very quickly with the entire group coming back together for this job, including Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot).The bad guy they're after is a British terrorist called Shaw (Luke Evans), who wants to acquire a weapon that can destroy an entire country and eventually the planet. The gang, along with Hobbs and his partner Riley (Gina Carano), have their first encounter with him during a chase through the streets of London. They all have nice BMWs this time around, while Shaw drives a custom-built Formula 1 race car that seems to be capable of doing everything the Batmobile can. A few chases later lead to a climax with a tank and a cargo plane that should appease the masses.The action itself is not executed well. The chase sequences and bigger action scenes are choppy, too quick and poorly staged. Due to the poor angles and fast cuts, not once did I think that the cars were traveling faster than the speed limit. On the other hand, the martial arts fighting is far superior to any of the car chases. I could feel every hit and fall. It's brutal, but not bloody. I hope that Part 7 has more of this fight choreography, because it definitely works.Meanwhile, a subplot follows Letty's (Rodriguez) return to the series. Last time we saw her, she was thought dead, but that's not the case here. She survived and is part of Shaw's team. She also has no memory of her past life or friends. This gives Dom and his crew a reason to take this mission and take down Shaw, which ultimately sets up Letty for future sequels.'Fast & Furious 6′ is a ridiculous action spectacle that will garner more chuckles and applause for fan favorites than it delivers genuine thrills. The acting is at time atrocious and the dialogue is just below that, but hey, this is a movie about cool cars and violence, which it delivers in truck loads during its 133-minute silly yet fun run-time. Don't forget to stay seated during the credits for a special peek at the seventh installment that shows a big action icon joining the franchise.",7,1,13,23 August 2015
The Book Thief," While I've seen better WWII films and better Holocaust films, 'The Book Thief' does a good job when it isn't trying to suck us into an emotional black hole.
","20th Century Fox would like you to compare 'The Book Thief' to the Oscar-winning 'Life of Pi'. The trailers even say, 'From the studio that brought you Life of Pi.' Not the director or the writer just the same corporation that financed both movies. The comparisons get even thinner from there.Sure, you can argue that both films come from novels, deal with survival of the most dire circumstances, and have lots of symbolism about life, death, love and God, but that's pretty much it. Any other comparisons are just an attempt to drive audiences to see 'The Book Thief' in the hopes that it will garner some of the same awards and giant pile of cash that 'Life of Pi' did. Unfortunately, I don't think 'The Book Thief' will accomplish these goals. Although the acting and story are pretty good, the poor pacing and too many cheesily sentimental moments ultimately undo the movie. That, and the lack of expensive CG effects, a beautiful world, or a big tiger.Working from Markus Zusak's novel of the same name, director Brian Percival (whose main claim to fame is a couple episodes of 'Downton Abbey') relies mostly on his cast to keep the movie trucking along. This is not a happy story by any means. It starts out with young Liesel (Sophie Nelisse) and her younger brother boarding a train, unaware that their mother is giving them up for adoption. On the way to their new family, the brother dies, as the narrator informs us over the grim images. In fact, the narrator is death himself.Liesel is not a happy child at first. She's forced to stay with a family with no other kids. Hans Hubermann (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife Rosa (Emily Watson) live in a small German village at the start of World War II. This village mostly consists of Germans who are not happy with Hitler and don't want to be associated with the Nazi party. Hans is the father every child wants. He's a kid at heart himself, who plays tunes on the organ, laughs at inappropriate times, and can talk to anybody of any age. His wife Rosa, however, has a thick outer shell, and seems to have a dark cloud over her at all times. Deep down, she's a lovely woman, but she rarely shows it.Soon enough, Liesel makes some friends at her new school, as well as an enemy or two. One of the friends is a boy named Rudy (Nico Liersch), an aspiring runner whose hero is Jesse Owens. Things get a bit more dangerous when someone from Hans' past shows up at his door. Max (Ben Schnetzer) is a Jewish refugee who wants to hide out in the Hubermann's basement. With Max's encouragement, Liesel learns to write. When she isn't writing her own stories, Liesel enjoys 'borrowing' great works of fiction from a Nazi officer's wife, which helps her escape her sad life.There isn't a whole lot pretty to see here. Our backdrop is a cold and frigid Germany, without too many green pastures or blue waters to take in. Fortunately, the actors hold our attention. Watson gives a great performance as a frumpy crank who hides her soft side without getting too silly about it. In recent years, Rush has been known for playing over-the-top zany characters, and we've come to love him for that, but here, he plays a sincere, kind-hearted and simple man. The true star is Nelisse. Her portrayal of Liesel is full of sadness and loneliness, yet conveys the character's strength in overcoming this horrible time in history. Her eyes sell every emotion flawlessly.On the other hand, the execution of the rest of the film is less than thrilling. At no point in time did I feel suspense for any character – which, for a WWII movie focused on the rise of the Nazi party, means that the film is simply not doing its job. Particularly in a scene where the Nazis search basements to capture hidden Jews, it would have done Percival some good to watch Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds', but I guess he missed that. A lot of the dialogue is cheesy and too on-the-nose' for my liking, and it seemed like the movie has four separate endings that don't flow well at all.On the plus side, the cinematography by Florian Ballhaus is beautiful and majestic, and the music by John Williams (yes, that John Williams) is one of the better scores I've heard a long time. While I've seen better WWII films and better Holocaust films, 'The Book Thief' does a good job when it isn't trying to suck us into an emotional black hole.",5,1,1,22 August 2015
Black Mass," It's okay to look at 'Black Mass' as a distant sequel to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies.
","It's okay to look at 'Black Mass' as a distant sequel to the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. Both have bad guys, wars, guns, monsters, and Johnny Depp. Maybe I'm reaching a bit there, but it's still fun to think about them as distant cousins in movies. The story of James 'Whitey' Bulger has been told a lot, especially recently. If you're unfamiliar with who Bulger is, he was one of the most vicious and heinous human beings to ever walk the planet. He was even the FBI's Most Wanted man for more than a decade, as he spent most of his time in Boston as a mafia boss who committed murder amongst other things.Not only that, but he was also an FBI informant, who in turn the FBI let him and his henchmen do whatever they wanted on the streets of Boston. It wasn't until only in the past couple of years until Bulger, who was then in his 80s, was caught, tried in court, and sentenced for the rest of his so called life. There was even a fantastic documentary about him, which you can read about HERE, or more famously, the movie 'The Departed', directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Jack Nicholson and Leonardo DiCaprio. In that film, Nicholson played a character that was based on Bulger. So you get the general gist of who this guy is.Director Scott Cooper ('Crazy Heart', 'Out of the Furnace') wanted to tell Bulger's story in the form of a feature film that tracked his start as an informant for the FBI and his rise to power as the most vicious kingpin and criminal we the world have seen. Despite an excellent performance by Johnny Depp (perhaps his best in years), 'Black Mass' is slow crawl to the finish line with episodic editing and far too much dialogue versus violent action sequences as the trailer would lead you to believe. Cooper even tried to mold 'Black Mass' as a Scorsese film in having his characters narrate over the film throughout the two hour run time.Even the narration was bland and unmoving. If you're looking for a 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino' type of movie here, you won't get it, even though some of the performances from Benedict Cumberbatch (Bulger's senator brother) and Joel Edgerton (the FBI contact for Bulger) are amazing. The film slowly treads along and shows us how Bulger and John Connolly (Edgerton), two childhood friends, who form an alliance between the FBI and mafia in exchange for information to take out other mafia outfits out, notably the Italians, to which Bulger and his crew have free reign to wreak havoc on Boston without getting pinched.And yes, this actually happened in real life. As the film progresses, we see more and more FBI agents and officers asking many questions to why nobody thinks to bring in Bulger himself. Add a semi violent scene in the mix, the mix and repeat with the questions and dialogue for over two hours, and you have yourself 'Black Mass'. I must admit I was pretty excited for this movie, but its slow pace and mediocre violence made me only want to view this once and never again, as 'The Departed' or the Bulger documentary itself is a far better experience than this movie.The only real shining light here is Depp as Bulger. His emotional and physical transformation is nothing short of haunting and frightening. Those steel blue eyes are as cold as an iceberg when he stares at you, and Depp pulls this off very convincingly. There's a great scene at a dinner table where Depp scares the daylights out of you and makes you laugh that infamous nervous laugh, as you never know if he'll snap and viciously kill you. I would not be surprised if Depp received a trophy for his performance here come award season.Yes, Kevin Bacon, Jesse Plemmons, Corey Stoll, Rory Cochrane, and Peter Sarsgaard are in the movie, but their characters are only given a couple of minutes of screen time, that we never get to spend enough time with them to make anything work or feel any remorse, let alone anger. In the end, I wish 'Black Mass' was better, but at least there are other options in regards to this subject matter to watch.Worth a Look",4,14,32,16 September 2015
Suicide Squad," 'Suicide Squad' commits suicide.
","There seems to be a good movie hidden somewhere in 'Suicide Squad', but the film itself makes it nearly impossible for you to find where those good moments are. The film is its own worst enemy, because it promises something new and fresh in the first dozen or so minutes, but then nose dives into the mountain from there on out. This is certainly writer/director David Ayer's most ambitious project and I can't tell if it's his mistake or the collection of DC/Warner Bros. executives who forced the notes on him to make this film not succeed, because again, the first part of the movie gathers your hopes up for something fun. Ayer wrote 'Training Day' and 'U-571', then transitioned into directing with 'End of Watch' and 'Fury', which were both new and fresh takes on tired genres. I was hoping that Ayer could breathe new life and put the DC Comic movie franchise on the right track, but alas, that is not the case.That being said, this is a tiny fraction better than 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', but again, that's not saying much either. I still think one of the worst films in the comic book realm was the recent 'Fantastic Four' remake. That movie on a whole was just terrible on every possible level. It was the worst movie of the year for me. Nothing worked on that film. Here with 'Suicide Squad', Ayer and Warner Bros. had all of the perfect parts to make a great movie, but somewhere in post-production, everything was lost, which makes me just more disappointed in 'Suicide Squad', because they had a ton going for it, but missed the mark, seemingly on purpose. This concept is nothing new with having a team of 'bad guys' unite to fight something worse for the greater good. Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' paved the way for this genre, which in turn gave birth to this sub genre that spawned 'The Magnificent Seven' all the way to Marvel's 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.Those films worked on every level of entertainment and filmmaking, where 'Suicide Squad' falls short on almost every account, whether it be the horrendous and cringe worthy dialogue throughout the whole movie, the unbelievably awful plot and relationships that are just flat out silly, to the vast amount of characters who never get any screen time other than a couple of shots of action. It was all a disappointment. Since most people won't know who or what the 'Suicide Squad' is other than big comic book fans with the exception of The Joker (Jared Leto) and maybe Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) , the first part of the film introduces us to all of the characters in a roll call style montage, each with their own flashback of their skill-set, arrest, and pop song. Sometimes, we are introduced to the characters twice, which didn't make sense.Like the trailer, Ayer filmed these biographical sequences with the use of those neon color schemes and the right amount of fun and explosiveness that promised something different that took us out of the dreary, dark, and moody DC universe, but as soon as this segment was over, it was back to dark and brooding in a dilapidated city of no color or even citizens walking around. The characters themselves are all great and have their individuality, but it never goes as far as that really. Sure Deadshot (Will Smith) shows that not only is he the world's deadliest assassin and has a chip on his shoulder in the form of Batman (Ben Affleck), but that he is willing to do anything for his 11 year old daughter, including to show her that he is not a 'bad guy'. That sounds good on paper, but the execution and dialogue is covered in smelly cheese throughout and never really investigates any of this.Jay Hernandez's character El Diablo probably has one of the better backstories, as his power is basically that of the Human Torch, but has now doesn't use his fire power anymore, due to an accident with his family long ago. Again, this wasn't explored as well as it should have been, and instead, we got awful dialogue and a terrible flashback that ended in that dreaded camera shot panning upwards with the character looking up at the camera, screaming, 'NOOOOOOOOOOO'. Another big problem with the film was the villain, who resembled a terrible looking Zuul from 'Ghostbusters'. The problem here is that the evil or 'villain' part is never explained as to why or what it is, but is rather just thrown in there with the tired use of the sky opening up and everybody and everything being sucked up into the sky. This villain is known as The Enchantress and is basically a witch with powers who in turn has a romantic relationship with the military leader named Flag (Joel Kinnaman).Again, she just owns this character from top to bottom. Her inner chaos and craziness is as good as her softer human side and you can tell she just wants to be accepted in some form or fashion. I'm glad she's getting her own film. Killer Croc's makeup is fantastic, but is only given some throwaway jokes here and there. In fact, the film had some reshoots to make the film funnier due to the backlash on 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', but it was done in such a lazy manner that you can easily tell where they added the worst and cringe worthy dialogue in to try and make it 'funny', which it wasn't. Other characters show up out of nowhere and never have anything to do but have some special skill that is never fully utilized or sought out. 'Suicide Squad' promises something good and different in its opening minutes, but then falls flat on its face and never recovers.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!",3,1,1,23 January 2017
Doctor Strange," Dr. Strange.....More Like Dr. Amazing.
","The next franchise in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes with mystical and magical powers in 'Doctor Strange', which is a damn good start to this new character. 'Doctor Strange' was created by Steve Ditko and first appeared in Strange Tales #110 back in 1963. 'Doctor Strange' or Stephen Strange is a highly intelligent surgeon who is in the top of his field. In an accident, he loses the use of his hands, which leads him to seek out alternate methods of healing. This brings him to a mystical and magical place across the globe where he meets 'The Ancient One' amongst other sorcerers that help him heal spiritually and physically.Whatever Strange had learned or knew before this, is out the window, as he learns of other worlds, universes, and powers beyond imagination. Soon enough, Strange has to help defend Earth, much like 'The Avengers' do, but on a different scale. While 'The Avengers' keep us safe from big monstrous physical threats on Earth, 'Doctor Strange' protects us from magical and mystical threats from other worlds – which in due time, we will see everyone come together and team up to fight some evil forces. At least I hope. Filmmaker Scott Derrickson was chosen to direct 'Doctor Strange', which seems like a 'strange' (all the pun intended) decision given his resume, which includes mostly horror movies – 'Deliver Us From Evil' and 'Sinister' to name a few, but it turned out to be a great decision along with his writing partner C. Robert Cargill, who was formally a film critic from AintItCoolNews, who co-wrote this film.The result is simply fantastic and a great start to the 'Doctor Strange' universe. Derrickson and Cargill have done a swell job in conjuring up a great origin story and executing each character's development here. From showing what kind of man Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was to his transformation to the superhero we see later on – it all works. Cumberbatch is excellent too here, hitting all of the right emotional notes as well as performing the physical aspects of the role nicely. The script has a slow burn approach to it in the first half of the film, but is sprinkled with excellent comic bits and action sequences. This slower approach is necessary to really connect and feel for Strange and it works out perfectly, as if you went on this powerful journey together.The only gripe I have, and mind you, it's a small one, is the relationship between Strange and Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), which feels rushed and tiresome, as it's been done before. Perhaps, there just wasn't enough time to really dig deep into it. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo was excellent and almost had a 'Serenity' quality to him, but was a very conflicted character, and he performed that very well. Mads Mikkelsen as Kaecilius was also fun to watch, but not the best villain w've seen. His makeup looked great and he did a great job, but there needed to be something more from him. Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One was perfect for her role and Benedict Wong as Wong stole every scene he was in.The visual effects were out of this world as some of the bigger action sequences had things I've never seen before in a movie. It was done on such a grand scale too that I was entranced in everything going on through the film. Now I'm not a fan of 3D, but if you have the option, see 'Doctor Strange' in 3D. The visuals are insanely good and it was indeed filmed with 3D IMAX cameras, and not converted like most movies are these days. It simply looks phenomenal. I can't wait for more 'Doctor Strange'.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,4,5,23 January 2017
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's vision for 'Barry Lyndon' is one of the most beautiful pieces of art and cinema out there.
","After 'A Clockwork Orange' and before 'The Shining', Stanley Kubrick made an epic period drama that was 187 minutes long. It's the least talked about films of Kubrick's resume, but should in fact be one of the most discussed for its sheer beauty and brilliance. Kubrick decided to adapt the 1844 fictional book called 'The Luck of Barry Lyndon' by William Makepeace Thackeray and the results were astounding. Not only did Kubrick's vision win critic and audience's praises, but it also won four Oscars and might be Kubrick's best looking film in his collection of work, which is quite the feat, considering every single one of his films is visually stunning.Hell, many critics and outlets have deemed 'Barry Lyndon' one of the greatest films ever made, and they wouldn't be far off the mark with that statement. But why does this film get the shaft from debates and film geeks like ourselves, spending hours discussing. Maybe it's perhaps the slow burn of this very long film, instead of Kubrick giving us a wild and adventurous tale of one man. Or maybe it's the fact that our main protagonist, Barry isn't such a great man from start to finish, thus disconnecting us with someone to relate to, not mater the time period. But I think that is one of the points here.Kubrick not only wanted to make a film that was similar to walking into one of the greatest art galleries of the world and spending hours looking at the gorgeous paintings, but also show us an objective look at a man's life and how he conducted himself in his own selfish ways, which leads Kubrick to hypnotize us for a couple of hours before smacking us in the face. It's quite a brilliant move on Kubrick's part. Told in two acts, 'Barry Lyndon' starts out with Barry's father being killed in a duel in Ireland. At this time he known as Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neil). After the death of this father, Barry falls in love with his cousin and makes several advances towards her, although she never reciprocates, because she loves the English military Captain.This angers the bratty and rude Barry and with his idiotic reaction to this, he is forced to flee his home and with no money and nowhere to go, he enlists in the British Army where he is shipped into the Seven Years' War. You'd think Barry would mature or think things through, but he doesn't and flees his post and regimen and ends up forced to join the Prussian army now. After the war, Barry is still a jerk and to make money, ends up becoming a cheating gambler with wealthy players. If his opponents give him grief or don't pay, he duels. Not exactly the best life.He soon has an epiphany and no longer wants to live a poor life of gambling, cheating, and stealing, therefor he decides to marry a rich woman so that he can live off her dime. He accomplishes this with marrying a very wealthy countess (Marisa Berenson). It's not too long that the countess realizes what kind of person Barry really is, who has now taken on her last name Lyndon, hence 'Barry Lyndon'. Barry openly cheats, steals, and does not love his wife, but only uses her for her money where he lives a life of debauchery for his selfish needs. The only person who seems to want to speak up or do something about Barry is the countess' son from her first marriage.And now we see all these issues and harm that Barry has caused come full circle as it weighs him down and causes him great humiliation, and rightfully so. What he has tried so hard to do, which is to clim the social ladder and keep his pockets full of money, suddenly come crashing down with his stupidity and childish actions. And the second half of the film focuses on Barry trying to confront these problems. This is not a redeeming story by any means as Barry never wants to better himself, but would rather keep up his shameful shenanigans for his own personal glory and wealth, which is coming to a stop quickly.Kubrick's vision for 'Barry Lyndon' is one of the most beautiful pieces of art and cinema out there. Each frame of the film could be paused, printed out, and hung up on your wall. It's that amazing. The use of natural light and classical music fully immerses you into this old world, and with award winning performances by everyone in the film, it's no doubt that Kubrick has concocted yet another masterpiece for himself and for us to enjoy and talk about. It's one of those films, like most of Kubrick's movies where if it is on television, you can't help but watch the whole thing all the way through. It's a film where you'll notice something different each time and take away something new with each viewing, which is something that doesn't come along too often.",10,3,5,12 August 2015
Interstellar," While this film could have benefited from being a tad shorter and tighter, 'Interstellar' still soars high above the rest.
","It's obvious with 'Interstellar' that Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is Christopher Nolan's favorite film, which is no secret if you've seen interviews with the 'Dark Knight' director. Armed with a core plot that all life on Earth will one day soon need to find a new planet to live on to survive, 'Interstellar' dares to define a new meaning to the term science-fiction. This visually stunning movie is a gift to watch on the big screen, particularly in IMAX, and tries so hard to deliver on both the science fiction aspects of space as well as our complex human emotions. With a film that has so much going for it in it's near three-hour run time, and so many big set pieces and theories, there are things that are bound to stick the landing, and other things that are destined to fall flat.Where you might 'Interstellar' in the science-fiction category, it doesn't fall into that 'way-out-weird' sub section, where aliens with acid blood run rampant. Instead, Christopher Nolan and his brother and co-writer Jonathan Nolan hired physicist Kip Thorne, who received a hefty executive producer credit for his consulting on all things science and technical on the film. My point is that every bit of space talk and what we would deem science-fiction was completely thought out by actual scientists and physicists to give us the most realistic version of this story. But Nolan tends to center the story on our core human emotions rather than the actual mission at hand, specifically between a father and his daughter. And it's through this plot device that molds this epic and beautiful film for better and worse.In an effort not to go the same route as so many other previous directors have gone, Nolan uses a life threatening infestation that is in the form of many big dust storms that are making planet Earth uninhabitable, rather than the usual climate change or global warming. Cooper (and impressive Matthew McConaughey), a former engineer and pilot, knows that something must be done soon, but has since been forced to become a corn farmer since NASA shut down several years ago, due to the economic climate. Cooper's ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) share her dad's love of space and science, which in a funny scene, gets her suspended for believing the Apollo moon landings from the 60s were real. Seems like people in this film think the Apollo missions were staged and filmed on land in order to bankrupt the Russians, a theory some people still have that Kubrick filmed these staged landings.Cooper and Murph share their farm house with Cooper's teenage son Tom (Timothee Chalamet) and Donald (John Lithgow), his dead wife's father. Cooper keeps things lively and obvious loves his kids to no end as they constantly talk about space and science and wonder about the stars in the sky. Luckily, NASA isn't really defunct now, but has gone secretly underground - literally, and is led by the intelligent Professor Brand (Michael Caine). He is leading an all out effort to send a spaceship to scout for a new home. The direct path to this mission is to go through a wormhole in space near Saturn that will shoot this brave crew to another galaxy, which NASA is getting signals from previous explorers they sent out years ago.Since Cooper is basically the only person for this job, he takes it, but that means he must leave his two kids, because he doesn't know how long he'll be gone. This doesn't go well, particularly for Murph who Cooper leaves inconsolable and remains an emotional mess for the entire film. This small crew led by Cooper includes Professor Brand's daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), a scientist, and amazing astrophysicist Romilly (David Gyasi), Doyle (Wes Bentley), and a very cool looking robot named TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin).Their trip to Saturn alone wil be two years, but once in another Galaxy, the time is different on Earth where maybe only a few hours to Cooper and his crew would be 23-years on Earth. And now Cooper and his crew must find a suitable planet to continue the human existence. McConaughey does an exceptional job here, pulling at the heart strings several times during the film. He can play the role of the ambitious go-getter and excited kid-like adventurer, and then flip the switch and become a ferocious brilliant leader and then turn it around and sob like a baby when seeing videos of his kids all grown up.Murph, now in her mid-thirties (Jessica Chastain) is good, but her character is one- note and still never gotten over the fact that her dad left her all those years ago. This is a recurring problem through the film. Anne Hathaway's character has a little more wiggle room, but not much and plays an annoying scientist who throws a small fit when she doesn't get her way. David Gyasi is excellent here, but is not given enough screen time to develop, although we all wish he was given the opportunity. But with Murph's older character, she just can't move past her her abandonment issues, therefor the story doesn't progress a whole lot with her, although she is a vital vein to the story.Hans Zimmer's score is monumental and always adds to each piece of emotion and suspense in the film. That being said, there were several moments where the impressive score outweighed some important dialogue, which was a little annoying, but just like Kubrick's '2001' opus, the space shots were silent with an good partnering score. Christopher Nolan has given 'Interstellar' the opportunity to explore the elaborate human emotions in a science-fiction setting, something I hope to see more of.While this film could have benefited from being a tad shorter and tighter, 'Interstellar' still soars high above the rest.",8,1,5,12 August 2015
Full Metal Jacket," 'Full Metal Jacket' is an intense yet darkly funny war film that continues to force us to question the duality of man as Joker so delicately put it.
","After five years spent making 'The Shining', Stanley Kubrick decided to venture once again into the war genre. This time, the focus is on the Vietnam war in 1967, centering on a group of marines going through intense bootcamp and traveling overseas to fight. Adapted from Gustav Harsford's book 'The Short Timers', Kubrick has concocted a masterpiece of war with deep themes of humanity and the struggles to be good and evil. The film itself plays out like a two-act play with half of the film taking place inside the first day of bootcamp, going through graduation. The latter half is war itself as we follow one particular marine with the handle of 'Joker' (Matthew Modine).Set to the excellent music of the 60s, we see America's youths getting every strand of hair from the hair cut off. I think Kubrick wanted to show us how our humanity is basically stripped and taken away once we enter the military so we can be reborn and trained again as a vicious killer in order to keep the peace. It's quite ironic, as 'Joker' states in the middle of the film when he is questioned on why he has a peace symbol on his marine helmet. He answers with, 'It's supposed to suggest the duality of man.'And Kubrick wanted to show Joker's journey as he sees both the good and bad in humanity. A lot of people say that the first half of the film that takes place at bootcamp is the better part of the film if not the only part of the film you need to watch. And while it is quite fun to watch Gunnery Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) yell at everyone for the better part of an hour, the actual war shows us just how some marines take to the atrocities of war. Some are sadistic, some are funny, and some are cautious.But when faced with the most extreme circumstances, our basic human instincts are usually the same. It's what keeps us moving forward as Kubrick shows in the final moments of this brilliant war film. And Kubrick's inclusion of all the actual Mickey Mouse songs and props were genius throughout the film. It was a subtle way to show us that in fact the marines thought this war and evil was indeed crap, hence the term Mickey Mouse was used as slang to describe something as amateur. And add to that all the marching and singing in the Mickey Mouse Show and it standing for American, Kubrick was on to something here, showing us through visuals and singing this theme song what we all really thought of the war as an entire city burns to the ground.It's truly a remarkable film with some damn fine performances by Modine and Ermey, but a little known actor at the time by the name of Vincent D'Onofrio delivers one of the best performances of that year and is still most recognized for this movie today (other than playing Thor in 'Adventures in Babysitting'). But his character Pvt. Pyle goes through such an intense time, that D'Onofrio transforms into something unrecognizable from when we first meet him with a smile he can't seem to remove. It's one of the more powerful scenes in cinema when we see Pvt. Pyle for the last time. 'Full Metal Jacket' is an intense yet darkly funny war film that continues to force us to question the duality of man as Joker so delicately put it. And Kubrick's camera-work, once again is the best there is.",10,1,2,12 August 2015
Pacific Rim," Robots, monsters and Ron Perlman. Oh my.
","Robots, monsters and Ron Perlman. Oh my. Director Guillermo del Toro gives us the movie that we've wanted to see since we were five-years-old. In an action-packed and brilliant visual effects spectacle, we have giant robots fighting vicious monsters on Earth. As a fan of genre films who knows how to tell a great story while mixing in loud and vibrating action sequences, del Toro was the perfect person for this project. 'Pacific Rim' moves fast and will keep you on your toes until the very end. While this summer has proved that big budget action movies don't always go the distance, I'm betting that this one will.We get almost twenty minutes of prologue before the title 'Pacific Rim' pops up on- screen. In the near future, a giant monster that resembles a mix of Godzilla and a dinosaur rises from beneath the ocean and destroys San Francisco. Unfortunately, this giant beast isn't the only one of its kind. Many more of these monsters, called 'Kaiju,' begin popping up all over the globe, wreaking havoc.Several years pass, and the countries of the world set aside their differences to make 'Jaegers,' 30-story fighting robots controlled by two pilots that sit inside the massive metal structures. We meet two Jaeger pilots, the brothers Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff), as they battle a powerful monster near Alaska. The secret to operating a Jaeger is for the two pilots to sync up their brains by way of something called 'The Drift,' which completely unlocks the other's secrets and memories, so that they can use their skill sets together to defeat their foes.Over time, the Kaiju adapt and get smarter, until they can now take out the Jaegers. The entire Jaeger program is being flushed down the toilet by the people in charge, to be replaced by a giant wall. (Now, if 'World War Z' taught us anything, it's that walls, no matter how tall or reinforced they are, won't stop zombies, let alone mega monsters.) However, when more and more Kaiju show up, Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) finds Raleigh and asks him to be a pilot again in one of the last four remaining Jaegers, in their final attempt to stop these monsters and save the entire planet.Since an unfortunate accident in an earlier battle, Raleigh doesn't want to share his mind in the Drift with anyone – until he meets the pretty Japanese girl named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), who is not only intelligent, but can hold her own in a fight with any of the guys. The two seem to make a perfect match. Meanwhile, the Jaeger program enlists the help of two scientists to tackle the obstacles of the Kaiju's origins and why they're coming to Earth. Dr. Newton Geizler (Charlie Day) and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) make up this mad scientist duo and provide a good bit of comic relief as they try to solve the Kaiju mystery. Finally comes Ron Perlman as black market Kaiju organ dealer named Hannibal Chau, who might just be the greatest character invented for the big screen in the past few years. I seriously want a spin-off movie focused on him.Guillermo del Toro knows how to film big action sequences in such a way that got the whole audience I was with cheering, clapping, laughing and yelling. Whether it be a Jaeger swinging an oil tanker ship like it was a sword, or one of the mega robots ripping out the tongue of a monster, everything is done on an epic scale with a heart-pumping soundtrack. The Kaiju all look very different from one another and seem to have minds of their own. The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen.Unfortunately, the two main leads, Hunnam and Kikuchi, are one of the biggest downfalls of the movie. While I like these two actors, they both fall completely flat with their surrounding co-stars, and their acting is almost laughable at times. But the film moves so fast and keeps so much else going on that you tend to forget about that problem.Idris Elba gets a great 'Independence Day'-style speech, and has a deep dark secret that I want to explore more. Charlie Day is terrific as the comic relief and Burn Gorman is a brilliant mix of Dr. Egon Spangler and Dr. Strangelove.Among the big action sequences, del Toro does a great job of developing the characters, even if they're a bit clichéd and silly. For this type of film, it works. This is one of the most entertaining movies of the year and I can't wait to see it again. A sequel is already in the works, so when Idris Elba yells, 'Today, we are canceling the apocalypse!', take that with a grain of salt.Don't forget to stay through the credits for a great little scene.",9,0,2,23 August 2015
American Sniper," 'American Sniper' fails in its redundant pacing and in my opinion, a poorly timed release, being Christmas Day.
","This production sure has had its ups and down. Actor Bradley Cooper was cast as real life Navy SEAL Chris Kyle who is one of the most decorated SEAL in US History with a confirmed 160 kills in the recent war as a sniper. He is responsible for saving many US soldier's lives. Shortly after Cooper signed on to star, David O'Russell ('Silver Linings Playbook' and 'American Hustle') wanted to direct, which would have made sense, because Cooper and O'Russell worked together before. But he dropped out and and Steven Spielberg signed on to direct 'American Sniper'. But yet again, Spielberg dropped out, leaving this project in limbo.But in the final minute, Clint Eastwood steeped up to the plate and took the reigns. After all of these directors, I'm surprised the studio wanted to release such a heavy handed and depressing film on Christmas day, particularly when this tragedy happened only within the last year or two. If you are unfamiliar with this story or don't remember all of the news stories, after Chris Kyle served four tours overseas, fighting terrorism and saving American lives, he had a fairly rough time adjusting to civilian life. But he found a happy medium between his wife and kids and helping injured soldiers back home with therapy sessions, which he chronicled in his autobiography of the same name. During one of his sessions with an injured marine he was helping, this marine murdered him and his friend in cold blood.It made national news and was a sad day indeed. One of the other big stories to come out Chris Kyle and his book was that supposedly he got into a bar fight with Jesse Ventura (yes, that Ventura), because Ventura was supposedly saying some nasty things about America and its soldiers. Ventura eventually sued Kyle and won, even after his death, which has made Ventura look like a world class asshole, but this entire storyline was completely omitted from the film, which is fine by me. Eastwood has concocted a pace very similar to the Oscar winner 'The Hurt Locker', which at times has a redundant feel. After Kyle's backstory from childhood through bootcamp, we travel with him overseas to fight in the war.After each tour, Kyle comes home to be with his family, each time a little worse for the wear as his PTSD is kicking into high gear. This happens four times, which again can get pretty repetitive and dull. Pacing aside, Cooper delivers a powerful performance as Kyle. His emotional range from a regimented soldier to a chaotic mess is brilliant. Cooper proves again that he is one of the top actors working today. And Sienna Miller plays Kyle's wife very well and realistic.Eastwood's direction is in perfect form here again with some very suspenseful war scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. That being said, 'American Sniper' fails in its redundant pacing and in my opinion, a poorly timed release, being Christmas Day.",3,5,14,12 August 2015
Southpaw," 'Southpaw' is the best boxing movie since 'Rocky'! Highly Recommended!
","When it comes to the world of boxing, there have been many films and documentaries that have been released on the violent sport. Some of the movies have done so well both financially and critically, that they have taken home more than one Oscar, and dare I say it, this new boxing film, 'Southpaw' is the best boxing movie since Sylvester Stallone put on boxing gloves in 1976 and put on one hell of a show against Carl Weathers in 'Rocky'. Despite its minor flaws, 'Southpaw' is an amazing film from top to bottom. Director Antoine Fuqua ('Training Day') has perfectly transformed Jake Gyllenhaal into a scary, muscular, bloodied monster of a fighter, who you would never want to step into the ring with.Along with Kurt Sutter's ('Sons of Anarchy', 'The Shield') screenplay, this story of a prized fighter who loses it all and tries to get back on top is one you won't soon forget. Oddly enough, this film was supposed to be some sort of followup to '8 Mile' with Eminem playing the lead role, but Eminem chose to focus on his music career more than star in this film, which Gyllenhaal took over and did a phenomenal job. Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope, the current Boxing Champion of the world who has never lost a fight. By his side since his humble beginnings from the orphanage he grew up in is his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams), who is not only his lover and best friend, but also his manager.The two live an ultra luxurious lifestyle on the outskirts of Manhattan with all the cars and toys you could ever want. Their lives are made better by their 11 year old daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). Billy Hope and his family are on top of the world. Even Billy's promoter and business manager (Curtis Jackson) seem to be making him more money and booking more fights for him, despite Maureen's pleas for him to retire so he can keep from getting injured seriously and be there more for Leila. Unfortunately, there is a terrible tragedy that leaves Billy homeless, penniless, and childless. One of the main flaws of the film is that Billy's downfall happens way too quickly.He literally loses everything all at once, which doesn't make any sense, considering how wealthy he is. It seems like everyone has turned on Billy, and now he must try to be a better father in order to get his little girl out of the hands of the state. This is where he meets Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker), a local boxing coach in a bad neighborhood, who gives him a job cleaning up the gym after everyone leaves. When an opportunity arises to fight the current champ Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez), who is also responsible for Billy's downfall, Tick trains Billy for one last fight for the title.This really isn't anything fresh or new story-wise, as we've seen this countless times before in other films, no matter what the sport is. However, with Sutter's script and Fuqua's brilliant eye for camera shots, this film seems brand new. Each performance is spot on. McAdams is fantastic and genuinely loves Billy, not just for his money and success, but for who he is, and it shows through McAdams's eyes and movements. Whitaker is also fantastic as the older crotchety boxing coach, who loves giving second chances.But the real star here is Jake Gyllenhaal. I mean, you don't see Gyllenhaal on screen, you see a new person named Billy Hope. He's virtually unrecognizable as the muscular and bloodied, ferocious monster he becomes in the ring. When outside the ring, you see his nurturing side, which he is consistently trying to improve. Needless to say, his performance here definitely deserves an award. With fantastic fight sequences that will make you squirm, some great dramatic and emotional moments, as well as a score by James Horner and new songs from Eminem, 'Southpaw' is one film you should not miss.",9,5,10,21 July 2015
Ant-Man," Where does 'Ant-Man' stand in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Find Out Here!!
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues this summer of 2015 with 'Ant-Man', which is a lesser known character and storyline than the usual big Avenger characters. This is a film that i've looked forward to for a few years now, because the story of 'Ant-Man' and his abilities are very cool. When I had my comic book store, I actually had the first five issues of 'Ant-Man' ever. I really dug those comics. Imagine how excited I was when news broke that director Edgar Wright signed on to write and direct the film.Wright is the brilliant man who brought us 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Hot Fuzz', 'The World's End', and 'Scott Pilgrim vs The World'. With those movies alone, you can only imagine what Edgar Wright could do in the Marvel Universe. However, it was never meant to be. Wright and the executives over at Marvel did not see eye to eye, so Wright left the project after working on it for three years. Marvel does a lot of good things and makes correct decisions most of the time in regards to their characters and stories on film. This is not one of those times. Instead, we got a director named Peyton Reed, who is the guy who brought us the cheerleading movie 'Bring It On' amongst other flops.This is a different film for the comic book company. Marvel bet big on 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which was not their routine story and set up, like we've seen in the past, but it ending paying off in a big way both critically and financially. With 'Ant- Man' they have a comedic actor, who really hasn't done anything in the form of action, take on the Marvel Universe and will be a part of the 'Avengers'. Again, this is a big bet for Marvel if they can stray from their usual storyboards. With the exit from Edgar Wright, it didn't look like a good bet.In an effort not to push back the release date of 'Ant-Man', Marvel hired Peyton very quickly, and after viewing the film, it became evident that almost everything was rushed. That being said, 'Ant-Man' is for sure a heck of a lot of fun and will sure make enough money for Marvel to bathe in and provide the already announced sequels. But that's about it. It's just a fun movie. Nothing more. Nothing less. 'Ant- Man' rushes from scene to scene and from montage to montage, leaving us out of any real character development from our heroes and villains. It just isn't really there.Yes, we get the backgrounds of everyone and some resemblance of a relationship between a few people, but it's all settled with a line of cheesy dialogue with no real emotion. As I continued to watch each scene, I could only think and say to myself, 'Edgar Wright would have done such a better job here.' Unfortunately, that's the way it is, folks. Paul Rudd is fantastic as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. I mean, how can you not like Rudd's genuine and unique comedic timing and charm, and that's where this movie succeeds most. Michael Douglas sure hasn't lost a step either, playing Hank Pym.He owns the role. Corey Stoll plays the villain of the film and while he is an excellent actor, the role and dialogue for him is so over-the-top and cliché, that you can't help but roll your eyes. Then there is Evangeline Lilly, who plays Pym's daughter Hope Van Dyne. She does an excellent job in her role, but again, the clichés are there and comes across as more as a character we've seen many times before.Perhaps the best part of the film are not with any of the superhero action, but with Scott Lang's criminal trio of friends, played by Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian, and T.I. Every time they are on film, I laughed till I hurt. They were fantastic. Unfortunately, they don't have much screen time. There are very small moments here and there where you can see Wright's hand prints, but they don't come along very often. Of course, you'll want to stay through the entire credit sequence as there are two extra scenes to get you excited for future films. That all being said, 'Ant- Man' is still fun, but doesn't hold a candle to any of the previous Marvel films we have grown to love.",6,2,10,21 July 2015
American Hustle," 'American Hustle' is one hell of a spectacle on the big screen, and while it may lack meaning and depth, it sure is a lot of fun to watch.
","Formally titled 'American Bulls**t', director David O. Russell has generated a lot of buzz for this film over the last few months. Coming off his Oscars for 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'The Fighter', you might think 'American Hustle' might be on par with his previous two films. While this movie is indeed great, it lacks any sort of depth or meaning that Russell has embraced in his previous efforts. But what he lacks in depth and meaning, he makes up ten fold in acting, characters, and insanity. I have no doubt that this 1970's comedy con-artist film will wow audiences with its comedy and sex appeal, but don't expect a 'think piece' here. With tons of other choices this holiday season, it's difficult to say how this will do at the box office, but with an A-List cast and the amount of hype this has, I imagine decent returns.Russel and Eric Warren Singer wrote the script to this film that plays out a little like 'Goodfellas' and 'Boogie Nights', and is a very fictionalized account of the Abscam scandal by the FBI on big politicians in the 70s and 80s. Before the film starts, there is a title card that says, 'Some of this actually happened', which garnered quite a few laughs. Instead of getting a boring look at the real sting operation in a film, Russel decided to write over-the-top characters and some hilarious incidents to spice up this story. Hell, the first 5 minutes of the film is literally Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) combing his remaining dozen hairs in an epic comb over and applying glue for a wig.Instead of diving into the ins and outs of the particulars of this Abscam case, Russell goes head first into the bizarre characters he has created and all of their flaws. The con artists are everywhere here. The police, FBI, and are main characters who are Irving and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), duo who are in cahoots, swindling people out of money and art. They are so successful at it, they have a legitimate business office and make tons of money. Irving and Sydney are even lovers, but Irving is also married to Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) and has a young son. Rosalyn is one of the funniest characters put on screen this year and Lawrence gives her and this movie so much life as she makes everything about her and would even go so far as to say she is responsible for all the good things in life.However, FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) arrests Sydney and Irving, and instead of putting them in jail for years, forces them to do a con job to take out corrupt politicians. And we're not talking about rape or murder corrupt type of stuff, we are talking about taking money from big investors to fix their turbulent city and make it better during the 70s. Thus, the long con is set in motion with each player conning everyone else, and quite possible the audience. The big mark here is Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is a great man, who doesn't do anything illegal until DiMaso, Irving, and Prosser basically force him to take money from a fake noble Sheik.Every actor shines here with Bale playing an overweight and balding character who struggles with his two lives and situation he is forced into. Adams is simply amazing and truly cons us all from start to finish. Seeing Renner is a great 70s wig and his swagger as a politician is quite epic as well. And Cooper here is just magnificent, and is a manic and deeply desperate man who is trying to get on anyone's radar. His commitment to this role is just amazing. Louis C.K., Jack Huston, and Michael Pena all turn in hilarious performances.Russell uses his camera much like an early Scorsese in this film as we twirl and waltz through this fun move. 'American Hustle' is one hell of a spectacle on the big screen, and while it may lack meaning and depth, it sure is a lot of fun to watch. The soundtrack is killer here as well.",6,0,1,22 August 2015
Rush," 'Rush' is a solid film with two brilliant performances from Hemsworth and Lauda.
","There's no doubt that Ron Howard can make great films. His movies have won numerous awards and have starred some of the biggest names in the business at one point or another. That said, with only a few exceptions such as 'Apollo 13′ or 'Parenthood', most of his movies tend to be forgettable after the first year or so and begin to collect dust in people's movie collections. Unfortunately, that's also the case with 'Rush'. People may love it at first, but I doubt that anybody will mention it next year.Much like Howard's first film as director, 1977's 'Grand Theft Auto', 'Rush' is a race car movie. However, instead of focusing on the races, this one hones in on the two main characters and their transformations at the height of their careers.The film tells the true story of the rivalry between Formula One champions James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) in the 1970s. The incredibly handsome Hunt leads a playboy lifestyle and is not above drinking, doing drugs or having sex with multiple women right before a big race. He takes dangerous risks and is a superb driver, which leads him to win quite a bit. On the other hand, Lauda comes from a very wealthy Austrian family that has disowned him for going into racing. He's the complete opposite of Hunt, and is only concerned with winning and working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. He has no time for friends, love or parties.Naturally, these two collide in more than one way and actively dislike one another. However, each respects the other's amazing skill in driving. After several races, Lauda is severely injured in a crash on the track and receives major burns to his leg and face, after which Hunt indirectly helps him return to racing in under two months.Howard's camera follows these two daredevils through their successes and failures. We forge bonds and gain respect for both, even despite their faults. Bruhl is phenomenal as Lauda. People used to call the real Lauda a rat because he had bucked teeth and mousy face, and acted like a rude prick most of the time. Nevertheless, when Lauda recovers in the hospital, Bruhl gives an exceptional performance. As the doctors vacuum out his lungs with a long pole, or when Lauda tries to put his helmet on over his newly burned face, the actor makes us feel the character's pain.Of course, Hemsworth is the Thor-like god we expect him to be. He's deeply charismatic, funny and devastatingly handsome, but there's real pain behind all the charm and beauty when his widely publicized marriage doesn't work out and his friends turn on him. One of my favorite scenes comes when Hunt brutally and deservedly attacks a member of the press for asking Lauda how his wife can look at his ugly face now that he's burned.'Rush' is a solid film with two brilliant performances from Hemsworth and Lauda. It's worth the price of a movie tick and I expect decent returns at the box office, but it rarely feels fresh and the racing scenes aren't particularly suspenseful.",6,0,3,22 August 2015
Nightcrawler," 'Nightcrawler' is one of the finest films of the year and looks impressive up and down the scale. Make it a point to see 'Nightcrawler'.
","It's very rare to me when a film stays with me for weeks on end. It's been more than a month and I still can't stop thinking about Dan Gilroy's directorial debut 'Nightcrawler'. It's a smooth yet very suspenseful thriller about a friendless sociopath who decides one day he is going to start a career in freelance TV new reporting, where we see him succeed as well as go to the metaphorical 'dark side'. This sociopath is played by the impressive Jake Gyllenhaal who (to put lightly) has major psychological issues. We've seen him play something similar before in 'Enemy' and 'Donnie Darko', but here, he's on a whole different level. It's easy for me to say that Jake Gyllenhaal plays the most frightening character in film in the last decade.We meet Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) as he is brutally beating up a security guard so he can steal some scrap metal for money as well as the man's watch. It's easy for us to see how unhinged Bloom is here with his facial expressions and actions towards everyone around him and needless to say, he can't hold a job for very long, but he is very willing and able to do almost anything in addition to him being somewhat of a brilliant mind. One night, he comes across a bad car accident and sees a freelance videographer (Bill Paxton), shooting the crime scene in order to sell this footage for money to local television stations. These freelancers are known as 'nightcrawlers'.Once Bloom sees how much money can be made with this, he is quick to sell some of his belongings to get a cheap video camera and a police scanner, and soon enough, her is out looking for something bloody. He catches his first major car accident and does everything wrong professionally including getting into the police officer's face, shooting closeups of the victims who are bloodied and on the edge of death with no regard of personal space or pleasantries. He has no limits of how he should act, think, or speak, which is why he is a loner. He turns in his first video to a local TV station where the news director, Nina (Rene Russo) will do and show anything on television for good ratings. Her motto is, 'the more blood and guts - the better'.Gilroy's script allows us to see Bloom in such a way where we should be afraid of him as well as encouraging him. All instances are awkward and horrifying, including Bloom holding an impromptu interview with an intern (Riz Ahmed) or taking Nina out to dinner and ultimately blackmailing her into sleeping with him to keep the news ratings high. There is literally no limit to what Bloom is capable of. And after Bloom witnesses a brutal home invasion/murder scene happen on camera, the things Bloom will do to satisfy his personal urge as well as his career definitely cross a big line.]'Nightcrawler' keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout its two-hour runtime. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom so pitch perfect, that you have no idea what he is capable of doing at any given moment. You don't know whether he will shaker your hand with a grin or rip your heart out of your chest and feed it to you. He's that scary. 'Nightcrawler' is one of the finest films of the year and looks impressive up and down the scale. Make it a point to see 'Nightcrawler'.",10,1,2,12 August 2015
Oblivion," 'Oblivion' is visually stunning film, one that should be seen on the big screen. Unfortunately, it falls short in the ways of storytelling or originality.
","It's been a great couple of years for science fiction fans. The genre has shown its big head again, and the masses seem to be eating it up. As we gear up for 'Elysium', 'Pacific Rim' and 'Star Trek into Darkness' (just to name a few) later this year, leading the way before summer is Tom Cruise's mega-budget 'Oblivion', directed by Joseph Kosinski, whose only previous film credit was 'Tron: Legacy'. I have no doubt that this will make tons of money at the box office, but it will likely leave a mixed taste of sweet and sour when most viewers leave the theater.To put it simply, 'Oblivion' is a giant mix of your favorite sci-fi films rolled into one 124-minute spectacle. While that might sound good on paper, sort of like a sci-fi nerd's paradise on film, that paradise can overload very quickly. Unfortunately, 'Oblivion' doesn't just pay respect to previous sci-fi films, but bluntly rips them off.Much like how 'The Lord of the Rings' started, we open with a detailed recap of the last 60 years on Earth narrated by Tom Cruise's character, Jack Harper (apparently no relation to Jack Reacher, Cruise's character in his last movie). Jack tells us how aliens attacked Earth and our moon, which caused natural disasters that pretty much wiped out most of the planet and its human inhabitants. However, the survivors fought back with nukes to kill the aliens. Well, that 'worked', but also destroyed the planet. Now, the humans live in a giant space station that takes all of Earth's natural resources for energy to transfer onto a new planet. Jack's job is to make sure that these giant machines do their job without getting destroyed by leftover aliens, who are referred to as 'scavengers.''Oblivion' takes several twists and turns throughout, all with different aspects of the sci-fi genre. The plot is reminiscent of Pixar's 'Wall-E', as Harper refers to himself as part of the clean-up crew of an abandoned Earth and even carries a little plant in a can that proves life can now sustain itself after the nuclear fallout. The giant space station looks eerily similar to the mothership in 'Independence Day', so much so that I expected Will Smith to pull out a cigar and say, 'Welcome to Earth.'To help Jack out on his missions, he's assisted by robotic drones, which are blatant knock-offs of Eve in 'Wall-E' and the robots from the video game 'Portal'. These drones talk, have unlimited fire power, can travel fast, and are extremely hard to kill. And what do all of these drones have for a camera and voice box? That famous red- eyed camera, made famous in Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. When Jack finally meets up with Malcolm Beech (Morgan Freeman), I thought I was seeing an older Morpheus from 'The Matrix' films.There's a point during the film where you just say, 'OK, I get that you're paying respect to classic sci-fi films, but let's do something original.' I can easily name several other instances of sci-fi films that 'Oblivion' pays homage to, but I don't want to ruin the surprises – or lack thereof – as you can see some of the twists and turns coming from a parsec away. This is not a typical all-out action film with tons of futuristic guns blazing non-stop and spaceship chases. No, this more of slower paced, character driven film, which at times seems to overstay its welcome just a tiny bit too long.I don't mind a slower paced movie, but when it travels in circles and ends up doing the same thing again and again is where I start to lose interest. That being said, the film is a marvel to see on the big screen. It's quite beautiful to look at, even with its desolate landscapes. The futuristic flying machines, guns and other objects are all created with some pretty spectacular effects. I also saw 'Oblivion' with the new Dolby Atmos sound system, which might be the best sound I have ever heard during a film. (Atmos has around 64 speakers in the theater that line the side walls, the back walls and the ceiling above. Each speaker is independently controlled, and smoothly and flawlessly pour out the sound.) It was a great experience, and if you have a Dolby Atmos equipped theater near you, I highly recommend seeing it there.Tom Cruise does a decent enough job here playing a guy who slowly figures out that things are not what they seem. However, I thought his characters in 'Jack Reacher' and the latest 'Mission: Impossible' had more depth and were more entertaining to watch. Morgan Freeman is always great to see on screen, but feels a bit underused and doesn't have enough screen time. Cruise has two female co-stars. Both Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko turn in solid performances, but are ultimately forgettable. It's great to see Melissa Leo in the mix, as well as Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau (Jaime Lannister from 'Game of Thrones') and Zoe Bell ('Death Proof'), who show up in their tiny roles.'Oblivion' is visually stunning film, one that should be seen on the big screen. Unfortunately, it falls short in the ways of storytelling or originality. You can't make a quality movie by putting together your favorite aspects of previous films and expect it to be coherent. If you're a sci-fi fan, you'll probably want to see 'Oblivion', even if its flaws outweigh its strengths.",7,1,2,23 August 2015
Man of Steel," 'Man of Steel' is everything we've wanted in Superman reboot. From the action to the dialogue to the characters, everything works on all levels.
","This reboot of one of the most beloved superheroes does an amazing job of retelling the fall of Krypton and Superman's struggle with his identity and origin. The film has some of the best action sequences I've seen in the last few years. With a lot of help from Christopher Nolan as a producer and writer, along with a great cast, this will score big at the box office for weeks to come and might be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year.The first twenty minutes take place solely on Krypton. We see an incredible visual landscape of this far-off world with new animals, futuristic buildings and spaceships hovering in the sky. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) realizes that his species and planet are about to meet an impending doom and informs the governing council of this unfortunate business. He and his wife have found a new planet to send their only son to survive and keep their race alive. However, the treacherous and murderous General Zod (Michael Shannon) has an evil plan of his own. Fortunately, it's stopped short, and he's sentenced to spend eternity frozen in deep space with his cohorts.From here, we see an older Kal-El (Henry Cavill) wandering from state to state on Earth, performing a variety of odd jobs such as working on a fishing boat and an oil rig, to even cleaning tables at a local dive bar. As he walks from place to place, we get flashbacks of him growing up in Kansas with his adoptive father (Kevin Costner) and mother (Diane Lane), who try to provide a normal life for the boy that crash landed on their rural farm. Kal-El starts to show signs of who he is as a young boy, from using X-Ray vision at school, to lifting a school bus full of kids from sinking to the bottom of a lake. From that particular incident, Pa Kent has an emotional talk with his son and shows him the capsule he arrived in. He tells him, 'You're the answer to whether we're alone in the universe,' but warns that the people of Earth might not be ready for him.In the meantime, respected reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) investigates a big story about a large object that has been buried underground for thousands of years, and travels with the military to do a piece on this phenomenon. Kal-El disguises himself as a crew worker on the site and finds himself in this object, where the image of his father Jor-El appears and teaches his son about the history of Krypton and their family, and reveals the red and blue suit. After he's gotten a few lessons in flying, General Zod and his minions rear their ugly heads on Earth and call out Kal-El. They demand that he be turned over to them or else they'll destroy the world.In the early scenes, we get an amazing character piece on the son of Krypton and his family, complete with epic action beats around every corner. From this point on, Snyder cranks the action up to eleven as gives us an explosive brawl between Kal-El and Zod on the streets of Smallville, which escalates to something even bigger in Metropolis. To say this movie is action-packed is an understatement. Yet between its fights in the air, on the ground and in between buildings, Snyder and Nolan still manage to pack in enough character development and some witty rapport between Lois and Kal-El.Surprisingly, Snyder doesn't use any of his famous slow motion in 'Man of Steel'. The fight scenes are fast and brutal. It seems like he took his cues from Nolan's Batman trilogy on this one. Also, Snyder uses a lot of hand-held camera shots to put us right in the thick of things. The movie has a few over-the-top moments scattered throughout, but oddly, they all work on a satisfying level.If you had any doubts about Henry Cavill filling Christopher Reeve's shoes, you can lay those to rest. Cavill is perfect for Superman. After viewing the movie, I knew for a fact that there could be nobody else but Cavill to play this role. I even saw glimpses of Reeve's charm and power in Cavill constantly. The actor is going places after this.Kevin Costner plays an emotional role as Kal-El's adoptive father. I'm glad that he left Tarantino's 'Django Unchained' for this movie. Diane Lane does a phenomenal job too, showing an unconditional love for her son, no matter what danger comes her way.Then we have Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Finally, someone has made Lois a real character who can handle her own. Not once does she really need the help of Superman. She can use a gun and stand up for herself. She's bold, funny and very likable. I like where her character is going. Michael Shannon is amazing as Zod, almost to a frightening degree. His anger and facial expressions could scare small children for weeks. Harry Lennix, Christopher Meloni and Laurence Fishburne turn in solid cameos as well.Hans Zimmer provides the score, and while I sorely miss John Williams' epic music, this one is strong and packs enough punch to further the suspense and emotions in each scene. It would've been nice to hear a small portion of Williams' theme at some point during the film, though. Also, I was surprised that the movie doesn't have a teaser after the credits for a sequel or a Justice League crossover. I was hoping that DC would follow in the footsteps of Marvel with this, but not this time around.'Man of Steel' is everything we've wanted in Superman reboot. From the action to the dialogue to the characters, everything works on all levels. This is a great start to something bigger in the future and I highly recommend everyone see this the first chance you get.",8,2,6,23 August 2015
Bridge of Spies," 'Bridge of Spies' with Hanks, Spielberg, and the Coen Bros. is solid, yet forgettable, & that's unfortunate!
","The year 2015 gives us yet another Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg movie called 'Bridge of Spies' with an added bonus of the Coen Bros. serving as co-writers. Now with a cast and crew like this, I expect something that would live on forever and win all the awards come award season. That's not really the case here though, as Spielberg's recent directorial efforts have been lacking a bit. I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying that 'War Horse' and 'Lincoln' were long, slow, dreary period pieces with no real momentum, despite some awards and critical acclaim.That being said, I bet any of you a hundred king-size Snicker's bars that you haven't watch or even thought of those two films since they were released. This all could be said about 'Bridge of Spies', which is of course, well made, interesting, fun, and well-acted, but really only worth one viewing and no more. Once it ends, you'll immediately forget about it and start thinking of Spielberg's next project, which a return to the sci-fi arena with 'Ready Player One'. I'm of the mindset that all of Spielberg's movies are worthy of unlimited viewings, no matter what time of day or night it is.It's just unfortunate that 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of those instances. All that being said, 'Bridge of Spies' is technically top notch with Tom Hanks giving another good performance. Set during the height of the Cold War, a soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is caught in New York City and put to trial unjustly. Meanwhile, the US sent some new U-2 spy planes do to take some images of Mother Russia, where one plane was shot down over the Soviet Union, where the pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) survived the crash and was captured and put in prison.Back in Brooklyn, lawyer James B. Donovan (Hanks) was forced to defend the Russian spy they caught and make sure he had a fair trial, but with the new information, he is tasked to try and make a deal to release the spies back into their country's custody. A trade off if you will. From here, Donovan has to weave in and out of high level Russian buildings, as he tries to broker a deal, which if not executed correctly, could have started a major war. There are plenty of Spielberg-ian moments to be had, which is always nice to see and Hanks's performance again is solid, however not on par with some of his previous work.The script is tight and to the point, but there isn't really any guts or memorable moments in this film. It plays for a good two and a half hours, all of which are mildly entertaining, but in the end, it's completely forgettable, which is unfortunate, because you have Spielberg, Hanks, and the Coen Bros. here.Worth a Look!",5,11,24,14 October 2015
Split," M. Night Shyamlan is quite excellent.
","M. Night Shyamalan has sure given us some wonderful and unforgettable films over the years. Somewhere along the way, Shyamalan lost his way as a filmmaker. So much so, that the studios would leave his name off all advertisements for the movie. It wasn't until 'The Visit' when Shyamalan came into the good graces of his fans again. Perhaps this is because he only had a very small budget to work with and got creative control without a ton of studio interference to do his own creative work. Now we have a new small budget film from Shyamalan called 'Split', and is yet another step forward for the filmmaker in the third part of his career, which seems to drop the Spielberg aspect and go straight for the B-Movie genre.This is where Shyamalan succeeds where so many others have failed. He's made a B- Movie with elegance and class that makes you think outside the box and keeps a high amount of suspense from start to finish. Sure, there are aspects to this film that are silly, over-the-top, and downright laughable at times, but it is more of a nervous, uneasy laugh, as we see where Shyamalan takes us. The film is simple enough, as we see three teenage girls kidnapped, (the main one being Anya Taylor-Joy from 'The Witch'),and brought to an underground basement somewhere by the likes of a man with split personality (James McAvoy), or shall I say 24 different personalities. We don't know why he has taken these three girls really, but he does reveal some sinister clues as to perhaps why they were chosen.His different personalities range from manly scholars, to endearing women, to an 8- year old kid, to artsy yuppies, and more. And McAvoy plays each of them perfectly, as he mixes their personalities with a certain kind of gentle yet horrifying way. As time passes, we see each split personality give clues as of what's to come, yet the burn and suspense is so high that you will be on the edge of your seat through the whole film with sweat pouring down your forehead. Shyamalan is not afraid to go to some certain dark places here either, as we see in some flashback sequences, and I applaud him for that, even more so for keeping the film with a PG-13 rating, but still managing to show enough to get the point across.Again, there are some fairly silly moments here, but they do serve a purpose in the overall story that makes this one big success for Shyamalan. Now for the moment of Shyamalan's calling card – a twist ending. Well folks, there isn't one. You read that right. There isn't one. It's a straight and narrow approach, but an effective approach. 'Split' is a very suspenseful B-Movie that achieves its goal from square one, which is to entertain and put you on edge, and keep you guessing until the very end. Shyamalan has sure found his calling card in the third act of his career and I hope he sticks with it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",7,1,10,23 January 2017
Divergent," guess 'Divergent' has nowhere to go but up.
","'Divergent',much like what it means to be a Divergent, never finds its pacing, story, or place in its 140 minute run-time, which is way to long in this case. The movie is unorganized, clunky, awkward, and cheesy. It never delivers a suspenseful atmosphere or on the gritty-mature nature of the story that it prides itself in having. Sure, it might have these aspects in the book version, but it is non-existent on film. I'm sure the word-of-mouth of this movie was not persuade movie-goers who are not familiar with the books to venture out and take a look, but those die-hard fans are sure to turn out in droves to see the hot male actors deliver their favorite lines.Again, the story takes place sometime in the future in a war-torn Chicago, where the remaining survivors of whatever happened are put into different factions to live and contribute to society at the age of 16. Each faction does something different whether it be lead, help others, grow food, or provide security. Much like when you're a teenager, trying to fit in to a certain group or discovering your true identity, each 16 year old is given a sort of test with hallucinogenic drugs that will tell them which faction they will most likely be in, which our main star Beatrice or Tris for short (Shailene Woodley) is labeled as a Divergent, which is bad news for society, as she doesn't exactly fit in with any faction. This means she can think on her own and not follow orders. People are supposed to report Divergents so they can be killed, but on the big ceremony day, these teenagers choose which faction they join for the rest of their lives.Only in this future, once you choose your faction, you can no longer see your family again if you choose a different faction from theirs and the one you grew up in. This isn't really explained in logical terms and doesn't make sense. Tris was born into the Abnegation faction, which is a peaceful and humanitarian group of people who lead the rest into a good future. But Tris seems to like the Dauntless faction, which provide security for people, and are loud, fun, and look like punk rockers. Hell, the way the even arrive looks fun as they jump off a moving train and and walk into the Choosing Ceremony like they were in some rock/rap music video, while the rest of the factions are in colored long robes, resembling a court judge.Upsetting her parents (Ashley Judd and Tony Goldwyn), Tris chooses Dauntless while her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort) chooses Erudite, the faction that is all business and led by Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet), who is quite good as a villain here. As soon as Tris joins her new faction, she and the rest of the recruits start training in the underground tunnels of a train line which is now home to the Dauntless. Since the Dauntless are the 'police' of this new world, there is a lot of physical training to go through, which is led by Eric (Jai Courtney), a rough no-non- sense man who would kill his best friend in a blink of an eye. After the first hour of Tris going through physical exercises that would make a marine think twice and some full-contact fights with the other recruits, Tris realizes there is something much more sinister at work here than protecting the people.One of the leaders of Dauntless is called Four (Theo James), and notices something different about Tris on how's she' not like the rest. Four administers a series of more hallucinogenic tests to look for her fears and to see how she deals with these situations. But her test results always prove that she is a Divergent, but of course Four and Tris are attracted to each other so nobody finds out. We come to find out half way through the film that the Erudite faction is planning a takeover Nazi- Germany style by drugging the Dauntless into soldiers and killing every man, woman, and child that belongs to the Abnegation faction. Now Four and Tris must make out and destroy the Erudite faction's plans before blood is shed, all while they are under everyone's radar.This PG-13 movie never gets to gritty for people under thirteen, but it so desperately wants to be that. The interactions between the characters are clumsy and are not given enough time to feel any real emotion for when something drastic happens with the exception of Tris. There aren't really a whole lot of good fight scenes or big special effects either. This first installment in the 'Divergent' series seemed like one big 2.5 hour set-up for something bigger, that ultimately won't pay off. Woodley and Winslet are the best here as Winsley delivers her character with a vicious angle and Woodley gives a great and charming performance like she always does. A lot of people are saying that Theo James turns in a great performance here, but they are all wrong. His performance is one-note, boring, and has no energy. If this movie was James's demo reel, I would not cast him in anything in the future. Miles Teller, Jai Courtney, Mekhi Phifer, and Zoe Kravitz all turn up here as well, but aren't given a whole lot of screen time. But Teller as always is hilarious and great on-screen.The filming isn't that great either and seems like a paint-by-the-numbers shooting script than anything that would force us to think or entertain. The score is uninspired even though Hans Zimmer was credited as an executive score producer, and it never adds to any emotion or suspense happening on-screen. I guess 'Divergent' has nowhere to go but up.",2,2,2,17 August 2015
Ender's Game," 'Ender's Game' will truly satisfy every sci-fi fan and will leave them clamoring for more. I know it did for me.
","Gavin Hood's adaptation of Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game' is everything I wanted it to be and more. I'll admit, judging by the trailers to this film, I didn't quite see how this would work, and I even thought it didn't look the least bit good. But ten minutes into the film, I knew i was dead wrong. And not only wrong, but this might be one of my favorite films of the year, and might be one of the best sci-fi films ever made. I know, that's a strong statement to make, but I stand by it. This visually stunning film, along with its great performances and story have created one hell of a fine film, that I sure hope will make enough money to warrant a sequel. Because after watching this two hour sci-fi opus, I wanted more...immediately.'Ender's Game' takes place in an unidentified future Earth, where a short while ago, aliens showed up in the sky. Naturally, Earth attacked, and all things went to hell when the aliens swarmed Earth, almost destroying humankind. Luckily for us, a fighter pilot named Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley), figured out a way to get the aliens off our planet. But the governments became to scared and started preparing for the aliens to come back and retaliate.Now some fifty years after the aliens came and went from Earth, we meet Andrew 'Ender' Wiggin', the youngest of three in a world where population control is at an all-time high. However, at Ender's young age of ten, he has a rare gift that has him able to analyze any situation and successfully achieve the best outcome possible. It's like he's the best chess player in the world, but with real life, as we see him defeat his school bully, but then still brutally attacks him while he's on the ground, and then explains that he, 'wanted to win the fight, and all fights after that.' This is a trait Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) is looking for in his training network.Come to find out, the government now believes that children have better intuition and make better decisions than adults, and with their video game playing skills, they can fly ships and evade enemies easily. So now there is a giant space station that hovers above Earth where selected kids go to train to be fighters against these aliens. And Col. Graff thinks Ender might be the sole leader to lead the entire army to defeat these aliens. A lot of the film is set in a type of bootcamp in space and is very similar to 'Harry Potter', where kids are in a special school and divided into teams where they are constantly learning and competing against each other. They even have team colors and names. You can't say this stole from 'Harry Potter' though, as 'Ender's Game' was written a couple of decades before the magical world of Harry Potter.Not only do the higher ups in the army like Ender for his skills, but that he seems to possess certain traits equally that kept his brother Peter (the violent sociopath) and sister Valentine (the caring peaceful girl), played by Abigail Breslin out of this academy. And it's here that we see Ender (Asa Butterfield) struggle with the task he has been given, which is basically to commit genocide on an alien race. But as he says and has a unique gift for, he can always tell and knows what his enemies are thinking and believing, and when he finds this out, hate turns to love. Petra (Hailee Steinfeld), a girl in the academy he meets sticks by his side and helps him along the way.The epic climax and twist will blow you away, if you already haven't read the books, and the actors pull it off very well. There could have been so many moments in the film where situations could have been handled poorly, but instead were executed by talented people and garnered excellent reactions inside the theater. Harrison Ford has done the best acting job here than he's done in the past several years. He owns this role. Plus it's great to see him in space again. Butterfield does and amazing job of being a constant emotional wreck, but always steps up to the plate when he has to. Viola Davis, Steinfeld, Kingsley, and Breslin all turn in good performances as well.The special effects are stunning as well here. The picture is on an epic scale and is always beautiful, specifically the space station where the kids train. The music score is also impressive and always adds so much emotion and suspense to each scene. 'Ender's Game' will truly satisfy every sci-fi fan and will leave them clamoring for more. I know it did for me.",8,0,1,22 August 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," 'Rogue Nation' is the Best 'Mission Impossible' Yet!
","A couple of years later from 'Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol', we have Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team, consisting of Benji (Simon Pegg), William (Jeremy Renner), and Luther (Ving Rhames) on a mission to acquire a certain dangerous cargo that is about to take off in a military airplane. I'm sure you've seen the trailers by now to know that Tom Cruise did indeed do his own stunts again, including actually hanging off the edge of airplane as it took off high in the sky. This is the opening scene to 'Rogue Nation', the fifth film in the 'Mission Impossible' franchise that ignites the bomb and iconic theme song.As the case with each film, there is a new director and writer this time out, which is Christopher McQuarrie ('Jack Reacher', 'The Usual Suspects', 'The Way of the Gun', 'Edge of Tomorrow'). McQuarrie is a very talented man, and he brought his unique sense of dark humor and wit to this fifth installment. I might just have to say this is the most fun I've had with a 'Mission Impossible' film, and that's saying a lot, because I really enjoyed the last two. McQuarrie's script is smart and energetic from start to finish, barely leaving you room to breathe, but also adding a good bit of character development for the new characters.In an early scene we see William (Renner) sitting alongside Director of the CIA William Hunley (Alec Baldwin) in front of a panel of people, as Hunley explains to them his theory that the secretive 'Mission Impossible' unit is responsible for tons of damage and destruction all over the world, and that Ethan Hunt and his team need to be brought to justice and serve time in prison, but most of all, the unit needs to be shut down. It's a hell of a way to start of this fifth film, as now the US government is now after Ethan as well.Soon after that, Ethan enters an awesome record store that sells amazing jazz and blues albums, only to enter a 'listening room' and get his next assignment, only to be gassed and see his secretary shot by a creepy tall man named Solomon Lane (Sean Harris from '71'). Ethan wakes up in a cruddy sewage basement of sorts to be tortured and beaten up by some rough looking me, although a woman named Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) seems to help him out. Once he escapes, he puts two and two together and realizes there is a secret 'syndicate' that nobody believes is out there. This syndicate, possibly headed up by Solomon Lane is trying to destroy and kill most of Earth's population, and now Ethan and his team must try and stop this from happening, as well as steer clear from the US government, hence the Rogue title.There is no shortage of action here and even though the film is rated PG-13, it feels like a soft 'R'. The fight choreography is amazing, as every hit, punch, or kick is loud and robust, you really feel like it's happening to you. The chase scenes are equally incredible here and puts you in the center of the highly suspenseful maneuvers on the motorcycles and cars. I was definitely on the edge of my seat. Everyone turns in a solid performance here as usual, but this is Simon Pegg's movie to shine, and delivers the emotional goods here, just like he does with every film he's in.Rebecca Ferguson is a much welcome newcomer as well, and I hope to see her in future installments, and then there is Alec Baldwin, who of course is great in each scene-stealing segment, right up to the very end. 'Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation' comes in at about 130 minutes, but it feels like only 60, due to the quick pace and energetic action pieces. Even a long scene during an opera in Vienna that is filmed perfectly seems to go by super fast. I have no doubt you'll have an excellent time with 'Rogue Nation', I know I sure did.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",8,3,7,31 July 2015
The Lego Movie," I can easily say that 'LEGO MOVIE' is one of the best films of the year so far. Sure, it's only the first week of February, but it really is that good.
","In the past, we've seen video games and board games adapted into movies for the big screen. More often than not, these adaptations are usually panned by critics everywhere and let down the fans. Or the film is decent enough for a 'one-time' watch, then is completely forgotten. You can say the above about 'Battleship', 'Street Fighter', or 'House of the Dead'. 'Clue' might be the only board game adaptation to sustain any sort of fan following, and actually has received a lot of positive remarks since it came out 1985.But nowadays, where kids born in the 70s and 80s, are having their favorite toys and games adapted into main-stream movies. LEGOS have been around for a very long time. I remember playing with them for years on end, building dinosaurs, cities, and spaceships. It seems that for several years, LEGO went off the radar, but over the past few years, they have made a comeback in an epic way. Now, there are LEGO boutique shops at almost every mall across America, not to mention a LEGO theme park called LEGOLAND. And we have been seeing more and more movies and TV shows selling their rights to LEGO, in order to sell LEGO-themed products. We've seen 'Star Wars', 'Lord of the Rings', and 'The Simpsons', to name a few, all now part of the LEGO world.It was only a matter of time before there was big LEGO movie with A-List stars attached to be released. Well that time has finally come, and I'm here to say that it is everything I could have hoped for and more. Just like the song you hear in the amazing trailer, 'Everything is Awesome', that is how you can describe the 'LEGO MOVIE'. It's rare when I have high hopes for a film, and then the film delivers on every level. I'm just glad it happened with this particular movie, as I'm sure fans of all ages will thoroughly enjoy this beautifully animated film.Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the two guys who gave us 'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs', the remake of '21 Jump Street', and the hilarious TV series 'Clone High', did a knock out job with the 'LEGO Movie'. The conjured up one hell of a cast that delivers on every note, along with some beautiful animation that brightens up the screen everywhere, and have given us a script that will not only make kids under the age of 10 laugh, but will also get the adults to burst out with laughter as well.The film just works on every level. The story focuses on Emmet (Chris Pratt), who seems to be the happiest guy in the city. He loves his job as a construction worker and enjoys following the rule book. However, Emmet seems to normal and nobody really pays attention to him. Meanwhile, there is an evil man trying to take over all of LEGO world who calls himself Lord Business and doubles as President Business (Will Ferrell), the nicer face to the people, as to trick them into his villainous scheme. Vituvius who resembles a 'God' like figure (Morgan Freeman, of course), tells of a prophecy of a special guy who will one day realize his abilities and save the world from Lord Business. Well, this happens to be Emmet, as he pairs up a hip chick named Wyldestyle (Elizabeth Banks), to set out on an adventure to recruit a bunch of other people to destroy Lord Business.They enlist the help of Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, the Star Wars characters, a unicorn-kitty, and just about every other pop culture icon you think of. The results are hilarious, as each actor lending their voice does a perfect job. Will Arnett as Batman is genius casting and the Star Wars cameos made me excited once again for a 'Star Wars' movie. The different worlds in the LEGO world all bring back tons of nostalgic memories of growing up, and are all laid out perfectly here.The pacing is quick, and there is never a dull moment. I couldn't stop singing the 'Everything is Awesome' song for two days after I saw the movie, and my only thought was that I had to see this movie again. I can easily say that 'LEGO MOVIE' is one of the best films of the year so far. Sure, it's only the first week of February, but it really is that good. Rush out to see this film. You'll love it.",9,0,1,22 August 2015
Dallas Buyers Club," 'Dallas Buyers Club' is more than just a depressing story. It offers hope and redemption in some dramatic and even comedic ways throughout. This movie is a must see.
","'Dallas Buyers Club' is a fresh take on the familiar AIDS story. The film has a knockout script and amazing performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. The true-life narrative about a heterosexual Dallas man diagnosed with HIV in the '80s is not as down-trodden as it might seem at first glance. This little indie movie deserves attention for more than just McConaughey's name and the drastic weight loss he underwent for the role.McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof, who starts the story as extremely unlikable. We meet him during a drug binge while in the middle of a three-way with some trashy girls. By day, he's an electrician for the city of Dallas, and by night, he's an urban cowboy not above yelling racial or sexist slurs at anyone. McConaughey pulls this off nicely, as if he wants you to hate him. But when a minor accident sends Woodroof to the hospital, his blood test results reveal that he's positive for HIV and that his T-cell count is dangerously low. True to character, he yells at his doctors (Denis O'Hare and Jennifer Garner) for implying that he's homosexual and getting the diagnosis wrong. Clearly, he's in denial.After some research at the local library, Woodroof comes to terms with his illness, even though the doctors say that he has about 30 days to live. He tries to get on a drug trial with the new experimental medication called AZT. When he's turned down, he makes a shady deal with one of the hospital's lower-end nurses to sneak him some of the medication. Upon taking it, his condition worsens. After more research, he finds out that AZT is more harmful than good, and researches natural vitamins and proteins that can help keep the virus at bay.Woodruff travels the world in search for these drugs. In his own uncharming way, he decides that he can make some money selling them to others with HIV. In an effort to keep authorities away from this business, he opens a 'Buyers Club,' which means that he sells a monthly membership to people, and in return they receive a monthly drug dose for their illness. Since Woodroof is known as a homophobe and is disliked in the gay community, he forges a partnership with Rayon (Jared Leto), a transvestite who also has AIDS, but is a key to moving the vitamins around town.One of director Jean-Marc Vallée's goals here was to show how the FDA and other government officials were not in the game of making sick people feel better, but rather to line their own greedy pockets with money from a drug that was clearly not working. Another aspect that Vallée focuses on is Woodroof's transformation from an asshole to a decent guy who ends up helping others. McConaughey achieves this perfectly. When he gets a dose of his own medicine from a former friend who puts him down for being gay, Woodroof's face displays the horror of what he's done to others. This role will probably get McConaughey an Oscar nomination.Garner has less to work with her and her character is a little one-note, but she turns in a solid performance. Leto, on the other hand, fully dives into his character. We feel all the emotions that surround him, even his flaws and his downward spiral.'Dallas Buyers Club' is more than just a depressing story. It offers hope and redemption in some dramatic and even comedic ways throughout. This little indie movie is a must see.",8,2,2,22 August 2015
Now You See Me," 'Now You See Me' is one hell of a fun movie and definitely invites a second viewing.
","Mixing parts of 'The Illusionist', 'The Prestige' and a healthy dose of 'Ocean's Eleven', director Louis Leterrier's 'Now You See Me' is a heist movie involving four magicians. The illusions in the film are over-the-top but incredible, and despite the film's flaws, its super fast pace helps its problems vanish from memory. With an all- star cast and decent dialogue, this magical caper might be one of the summer's biggest surprises.Getting things started quickly, we're individually introduced to our four magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), a cocky sleight-of-hand illusionist who could put David Copperfield to shame; Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), a beautiful escape artist who can slip out of a glass box full of hungry piranhas; Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), a hilarious and quick-witted hypnotist; and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), who's basically the equivalent of Matt Damon's role in the 'Ocean's' movies, a terrifyingly good pickpocket.All four characters are first brought together by an unknown person to pull off a high-tech illusion. Fast forward to their first heist. Now dubbed the Four Horsemen, the team somehow manages to rob a bank in Paris, France while live on stage in Las Vegas, then makes the arena rain with cash over their audience. FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is hell-bent on taking down this band of thieves with the help of Interpol detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent), who seems to have a few secrets of her own. On top that come Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a television personality famous for debunking magic tricks, and Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), the financier for the Four Horsemen.These characters move quickly from state to state performing shows that draws hundreds of thousands of spectators. Meanwhile, several law enforcement agencies track their every move and Bradley tries to cash in on their mistakes. A car chase and a decent fight scene later, the film climaxes in New York with a twist ending that would put M. Night Shyamalan to shame. I can't wait to watch this movie again to see if I missed any hints to the twist along the way.The illusions are such an unbelievable spectacle that you have to watch the movie with a childlike sense of wonder and fascination. Much like the audiences seen in the film, you too will turn to putty in the Four Horsemen's hands. This incredibly fast-paced movie succeeds with fun banter between the actors. It's like a 'Zombieland' reunion with Harrelson and Eisenberg, and a 'Dark Knight' homecoming for Freeman and Caine, complete with witty insults and threats. It's a real treat.'Now You See Me' is one hell of a fun movie and definitely invites a second viewing. I don't think this will win any awards, and maybe it has a few issues here and there, but as quickly as this picture moves, you won't pay attention to the problems, because there's a bigger surprise up its sleeve.",8,1,2,23 August 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," This is the BEST 'X-Men' movie to date and is well worth one-hundred viewings.
","The big blockbuster movies for the summer of 2014 have officially kicked off and 'X- Men: Days of Future Past' might be the best one yet. For the past year, I've been looking forward to seeing this and original X-Men director Bryan Singer returning to this storyline. If you remember, back in 2000, Singer was the first director to take on a big budget comic book movie with the first 'X-Men' film, and the studios were waiting to see if it was going to do enough business. Made on what seems to be a modest budget of only $75 million, the first X-Men film made $300 million domestically, and that's before 3D and all of the IMAX screens. Well, the rest is history, as we have had tons of comic book films come out since then. But it feels great to be back with the one that started it all.First off, this 'X-Men' film is superbly shot and told. It deals with time travel, and not every director and writer in the business can tell a good time travel story without some people getting thrown off course. But here, it is done exceptionally well and is easy to follow. If the title 'Days of Future Past' confuses you, don't worry, I'll explain it. The title refers to a story arc of the X-Men comic books and focused on a desolate Earth where these large and highly adaptable robots called Sentinels destroyed everyone and everything. You might remember the Sentinels as the giant purple robot bad guys from the comics. It's as if the worst possible outcome of a 'Terminator' were to come true, only with no Arnold Schwarzenegger to handle things and save the day.These Sentinels are zeroing in on the X-Men, as it seems they are the last of the mutants left on Earth. In an amazing opening scene, we see Magneto (Ian McKellen), Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Bishop (Omar Sy), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Blink (Bingbing Fan), Sunspot, Warpath, and Colossus, Halle Berry returning as Storm and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine trying to fight off these Sentinels. Singer must be a huge 'Portal' fan, because there is a lot of portal opening going on here in the style of the game. And it's so much fun to watch. Pryde is able to take somebody's mind and soul and send it back in time, which Xavier and Magneto want to do to stop this Sentinel war from starting. But the ability to go back in time to the early 70s would rip apart anyone's brain.But since Wolverine can regenerate immediately, he is sent back in time to find the young Prof. Xavier (Jame McAvoy) and the young prisoner Magneto (Michael Fassbender) to help stop Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from killing Dr, Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), who is responsible for creating the sentinels and selling them to anyone who wants to buy them. We find out that Mystique killing Trask is the one event that sets in motion the destruction of the future that we see in the first scene.The bulk of the film is running around with Wolverine and the younger versions of Magneto, Xavier, and Beast (Nicholas Hoult) as they try and fix the past so that the world is not destroyed and they can keep their lives. It literally is a race against time. One of the coolest scenes involved Quicksilver (perfectly played by Evan Peters), when he broke Magneto out of prison. I could watch that scene on loop for hours. If you can believe it, Wolverine plays the level-headed man through the entire film this time around and focuses more on the young Xavier coming to terms with his handicap and dealing with his super power and McAvoy shows his struggle flawlessly.Fassbender is cool as ice as Magneto again and Peter Dinklage is as good as ever as the evil Dr. Trask. One of the only complaints is the lack of a big epic climactic fight scene at the end. Sure, there is a big climax, but it offers very little fighting. But that's nit-picking. And of course, stay till the end of the credits for a great scene of what's to come. The acting, filming, and special effects were all top notch here and I want Quick Silver spin off movie for sure. This is the BEST 'X-Men' movie to date and is well worth one-hundred viewings.",8,0,1,17 August 2015
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," It's not so fantastic.
","Grab your wands, spell books, wizards and witches, because the world of 'Harry Potter' is back for the long haul with J.K. Rowlings' book 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to find Them'. This film is the first in a set of five upcoming movies and begins with a good amount of character introductions, but not necessarily origin stories. Instead of taking place in a somewhat modern day London or even that of the magical place of Hogwarts, 'Fantastic Beasts' takes place in the 1930s in New York, which is around the same time that King Kong would have been climbing buildings. So before Harry Potter himself was even born, this whole fantastic tale took place, which follows a young man named Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) who travels from England to the USA to release a beast of a bird in Arizona to be free. Scamander is a bumbling and clumsy young man, so it's easy to see how and why he would lose his literal briefcase full of beasts out on New York, which is the main stage and story for the film.Meanwhile, there is an evil wizard named Gellert Grindewald who is on the loose and is one of the most dangerous and most evil wizards there ever was, along with a U.S. group that hates all wizards and witches that tries to take out Scamander and other wizards and witches. Scamander has some help on his quest with two sisters named Tina and Queenie Goldstein, who work for the U.S.A.'s version of the Ministry of Magic called the Magical Congress of the United States of America, which is mostly led by a sinister yet conflicted man named Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), who has taken to an abused young boy named Credence (Ezra Miller). Filmmaker David Yates is back in the director's chair again, as he will be for all five films.Yates knows the world of 'Harry Potter' very well, as he directed the last four 'Harry Potter' films, and leaves the kid jokes at the curb. 'Fantastic Beasts' is a very dark and sinister film, although it is filled with wonder and amazing creatures. What Yates and Rowling do well is fully immerse you into the magical world of wizards again, with different spells, fun buildings and creatures, and hints of bigger back stories that are not fully told yet. This setup of a film introduces us to some great characters and plot points that will be the focus of future films without giving much away here, which was a nice touch. There are some mentions of a few characters from the 'Harry Potter' films, but again, 'Fantastic Beasts' stands on its own and is fairly easy to separate the other movies from this.The world here is bleak and full of adult themes, leaving the funny kid jokes on the back burner, which I admit, I miss here, but the new comic relief comes from Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski, who is a muggle whose dream is to open up a bakery. By just being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he is tangled up with Newt and this world of magic, and he steals every scene he is in. I really hope they bring him back for future films in a big way. 'Fantastic Beasts' is a great start to a new 'Harry Potter' franchise, despite the bleakness throughout the film.RECOMMENDED!",5,3,5,23 January 2017
The Conjuring 2," I slept with the lights on after 'The Conjuring 2'!
","It seems like a ton of horror movies come out every year, and most times, they don't live up to their potential. There are a handful of horror movies over the last decade that really satisfy us horror fans. Films like 'The Babadook', 'It Follows', and 'The Conjuring' will still be talked about for years to come. One name in the horror genre, or at least in recent years is James Wan. This man burst onto the scene with 'Saw', which was basically genre changing and spawned a ton of sequels. Wan also made a few other horror films, all testing the bounds and pushing us into a new horror direction, while still respecting his influences.I can easily say that James Wan's name belongs up there with the likes of John Carpenter and Stephen King. The guy knows horror and how to execute it so well that his images will continue to haunt for many years to come. I'm glad he signed on to take on the Ed and Lorraine Warren investigations some years ago and gave us 'The Conjuring' and now 'The Conjuring 2', which was previously titled 'The Enfield Poltergeist'. If you're unfamiliar with Ed and Lorraine Warren, these are two real-life people who were paranormal investigators and professors, who helped a lot of people from hauntings and possessions.Perhaps their most famous investigation was 'The Amityville Horror', which is where 'The Conjuring 2' starts out, as Ed and Lorraine Warren are investigating the house a few months after the Lutz family moved out. It's here that Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) has a vision of something so sinister, that she makes her husband Ed (Patrick Wilson) promise that they are done with these investigations. That's when things start to go awry over in England at the Hodgson residence where things go bump in the night and then some, as the mother Peggy Hodgson and her four young kids are subjected to moving furniture, screams, and much more.Ed and Lorraine hear of this and set out to England to help out, despite their previous promise, and then all hell breaks loose – literally. Running at over two hours, there are certain times where 'The Conjuring 2' seems like its doing too much, but there is nothing bad about the movie really. It's just that we're put through so much suspense, horror, and terror, that by the final act, we are glad it's over with. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it makes you exhausted by the end. Director James Wan is true modern master of horror. He uses the usual horror genre tropes, but makes them relevant and fresh all over again, whether it be a child hiding under the covers while something is hovering over you, or a possessed toy, and even ghostly visions.Most of these moments will leave a lasting and terrifying impression that will make it difficult to sleep at night, particularly a certain beastly nun. I still get shivers thinking about it. Wan also adds some comedy here, but is used sparingly, and is relegated to the time period. It was a nice breath from all the intense horror that was going on in the film. The score is fantastic and adds to every single moment of terror. It's incredible that these stories are real and that you can actually research them, and Wan does an incredible job of adapting the material and making it entertaining and scary-as-hell. 'The Conjuring 2' is a fantastic sequel and is an instant horror classic.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,0,0,23 January 2017
Inside Out," It's safe to say that Pixar is back on top again with 'Inside Out'.
","I'm a huge fan of Pixar and their animated films. They have changed the way films are made, and each movie since 'Toy Story 1' in 1995 has been a success both critically and financially, making Pixar one of the biggest movie studios ever. Hell, all of the Pixar films combined have made over $9 billion (with a 'B') at the box office. That's not to mention home video or merchandising sales. Since 'Toy Story III' in 2010, there has only been three Pixar movies, all of which have been less favored to Pixar's previous films including 'Wall-E', 'Up', and the third 'Toy Story' movie.With 'Cars 2', 'Brave', and 'Monster's University', the story lines and general excitement were muddled and less than stellar. It seemed like Pixar mostly phoned it in, trying to capitalize on toy sales or the laziness of a sequel rather than a good film with a decent story line developing characters. Now we're in 2015 and we have a brand new original Pixar movie called 'Inside Out' from the director of 'Up', Pete Docter. In fact, Pete Docter adapted the story from his own life where his parents packed him and his siblings up and moved across the country to a new place, where he had to make new friends and learn new surroundings.It was rather tough for him, being young in a new school, having to deal with bullies and being 'the new kid'. This translates into a young girl named Riley who has two loving parents (voiced by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan) who moves their family from Minnesota to San Francisco for a job. Riley is a great kid, who is popular, always nice, loves her parents, and is quick to make you laugh and care about what you have to say. This is mostly due to the emotions that live within her. According to Pixar, every living thing, whether it be a human, dog, or cat, have little beings living in our brain that make us function and feel the range of emotions we go thru life with.Luckily for Riley, her main emotion is Joy (Amy Poehler) who is more or less in control of Riley most of the time, as she believes Riley should be happy every second of every day no matter what. There is also Sadness (Phyllis Smith from 'The Office'), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling), who all make up the range of emotions that Riley shows thru her young life now. These emotions living in her head operate the control board in her brain to make her function, creating good and bad memories for her.Unfortunately, something happens between Sadness and Joy, and they are thrown out of the 'brain control' room, leaving Fear, Anger, and Disgust to operate Riley. As Joy and Sadness try to make their way back to the control room, they learn important life lessons in order to make a great living being. One of the things I love most about 'Inside Out' is that it never dumbs down any plot line for a younger audience, which was something 'Wall-E', 'Up', and 'Toy Story III' never did either.Each character has its moment to shine and never sways off course or goes into the land of silliness to attract a cheap laugh. Instead, these wonderful characters take us on an emotional journey of new change and how to deal with our feelings. 'Inside Out' is a true delight to watch and I can't wait to watch it again. The voice actors are all excellent with Poehler and Smith delivering some excellent performances here. Lewis Black and Bill Hader are down right hilarious the whole way through as Anger and Fear. It's safe to say that Pixar is back on top again with 'Inside Out'.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!P.S. - The short Pixar film before 'Inside Out' is called 'Lava' is FANTASTIC.",8,4,25,27 July 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Desolation of Smaug' is a great second installment and loads better than the first film.
","And we've arrived in the 2nd year of Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy with 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug', and let me tell you, it's a big improvement on the last film, which was released the same time last year. First off, we don't have to spend a half hour inside Bilbo's home with thirteen dwarfs eating, drinking, and singing songs about washing dishes and Bilbo's unhappy attitude. In this sequel things start off fast and to the point, which is sure to excite all audiences. Still, adapting J.R.R Tolkien's less than 300 page novel into three separate films might be a bit much, but damn if it isn't fun and highly entertaining this time around with a giant fire breathing dragon, some epic battles, a familiar elf, and an escape from orcs that I could watch 100 times in a row and never tire of. Just like the previous films set in Middle Earth, I expect another billion dollars for Jackson and co.You might happy to know that this sequel is less than three hours, but barely, which is surprising given the shortness of the novel it's based on, but Jackson is adding a bunch of the appendices from Tolkien's universe. And while the last film dragged on quite a bit, Jackson this time around paces the film very nicely with great development with new characters and some intense action sequences.'The Desolation of Smaug' focuses on Bilbo and the thirteen dwarfs making their way to the Lonely Mountain in the underground kingdom of Erebor to have Thorin Oakenshield reclaim the throne from the frightening dragon named Smaug, which we saw at the beginning of the last film where the kingdom was destroyed and torched. Once again, Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarfs encounter many obstacles along their way, which hinder their advancement to the lonely mountain quickly.Originally, Guillermo Del Toro was supposed to direct these films, but dropped out, however still has a credit in the film. But Jackson and his co-writers and producers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens decided to add a couple of new characters to the film, which were not in the Tolkien books at all. Perhaps to give a small romantic angle for our traveling companions. You'll be happy to know that Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and fellow elf Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), a sexy female elf who is as skilled with a sword and bow as Legolas is, both have big story arcs here and whose romantic feelings are mixed with one of the dwarfs, specifically Kili.Gandalf senses something wrong and leaves Bilbo and the dwarfs to travel the road alone for the time being, as Gandalf sets out to ultimately discover the one true evil that sets the 'Lord of the Rings' films in motion. Meanwhile the dwarfs and Bilbo head into the Mirkwood forest, where if you stray off path, you'll begin to have an acid-like trip and become lost forever. Add to that some giant spiders who enjoy dwarfs for breakfast, and you got yourself a little suspenseful scene. But the elves show up, but end up taking the dwarfs prisoner, but thanks to Bilbo the burglar and a big orc battle, the little band of men escape in one of the best escape scenes I've ever seen. I'm serious, this need to be some sort of ride at a theme park. It's that fun.Th dwarfs and Bilbo end up at a once great town on the sea named Lake Town, where a jerk dictator (an excellent Stephen Fry) has taken control over the town and turned into a poor and poverty stricken city. Luckily a man named Bard (Luke Evans) smuggles the dwarfs in the town to help them on their quest, where Bard soon realizes he'll have to play a much bigger role in this trilogy. But that's not this time.Here, we end up in the gold and rich kingdom of the dwarfs and we meet Smaug. This dragon is just incredible. He's voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch and might be the scariest scaled character to ever grace the screen. His movements, motifs, and voice are purely terrifying. While Cumberbatch's voice is a little too modified digitally for me, it still is great.Martin Freeman plays Bilbo very well again, and has a little more wiggle room here to see his decent into madness and obsessions with the ring and other riches, but ultimately shows how courageous he really is. Lilly does an impressive job here to as the elf while Bloom as Legolas is there to only shoot his arrow into orcs. And that he does very well.While there are some suspenseful moments, we all know how this turns out, and being three movies long, we know the dwarfs and Bilbo won't be killed off, no matter how dire the situation is. This doesn't really take anything away from the movie, but it's always in the back of your mind. This 2nd installment ends on a big cliff hanger and will leave you in the theater yelling, 'Nooo', as the prefect and vicious Smaug sets out to unleash his fiery evil and the orc population is growing rapidly.The 3D is is okay at best, but is not necessary, and actually darkens the screen quite a bit, which I didn't care for, but there is more filmic look to this one, which was nice compared to the high frame rate of the first film. 'The Desolation of Smaug' is a great second installment and loads better than the first film. It's also the darkest yet, as nobody has a good outcome as of yet. Despite the abundance of too much CG, I cannot wait to see this again.",8,0,3,22 August 2015
Non-Stop," I enjoyed 'Non-Stop' for what it was and what it tried to be, but the ending is almost unforgivable.
","In the next installment of Liam Neeson saving the world, or in this case, 150 people 30,000 feet up in the air on a commercial airliner from New York to London, things are so over-the-top ridiculous, things tend to not make a whole lot of sense. But what do you really expect from a Liam Neeson movie these days? That being said, this thriller in the air called 'Non-Stop' is quite fun and is less cheesy than the 'Taken' films, but not as gritty as 'The Grey'.This outing marks the second team-up with Neeson and director Jaume Collett- Serra who previously worked on 'Unknown'. Jaume also directed the remake of 'House of Wax' (the one with Paris Hilton), and the little horror film, 'Orphan', so keep that in mind. But I have no doubt that Universal Pictures will make their money back with this Neeson vehicle, despite just how absurd this film is. The three writers on this movie make a decent attempt at a 'terror in the sky' story line as we meet Bill Marks (Neeson), who is a former NYPD officer turned Air Marshall who is completely afraid to fly. So much so, that he has a death grip on a ribbon and his seat at the same time.But luckily he sits next to Julianne Moore, who makes an effort to calm him down. But this seemingly normal flight takes a turn for the worst when Marks receives a text message saying that someone will die on the plane every twenty minutes if $150 million is not wired to an account.Twenty minutes go by and someone dies, and then another, and another. Meanwhile for reasons unexplained, the rest of the people on the plane are unaware that people have died, nor do they know what is going on.The writers give us a twist with the account that the $150 million is supposed to be wired to is under Marks' name, thus everyone accuses him of hijacking the plane, rather than protecting it. Marks tries all sorts of tricks to find out who is sending the texts to him, but cannot seem to find the villain, let alone figure out how wireless works over the middle of the Atlantic ocean. For most of the film, we are on a mystery hunt with Neeson, as it plays out more like a 'Whodunit' yarn, than an action packed thriller.The characters on the plane aren't exactly original as we have the Muslim guy who everyone thinks is a terrorist, the burly bald guy who is a police officer, the angry black guy, a creepy dude with glasses, and a hot female who is not above having sex in public. The plot goes from bad to insanely ridiculous when a bomb is discovered on board. How they deal with this is laughable, and when the villain and reason behind this debacle is just atrocious. It comes across as lazy writing, and would never be a real reason for doing something like this. It just doesn't make sense, much like the entire movie.Neeson does all he can with what he's given here, and even his short speech of how he's not a great man, but an asshole alcoholic is not engaging. And anybody, literally anybody could have played Julianne Moore's role, as her character is not important. It took 'Flight 10 minutes to accomplish a great and suspenseful airplane sequence, in what it took 90 minutes for 'Non-Stop' to not accomplish. I know this review makes it sound like i really hated it, but that's not necessarily the case. I enjoyed 'Non-Stop' for what it was and what it tried to be, but the ending is almost unforgivable. Is it worth seeing? I wouldn't waste your time in the theater, but should satisfy enough on home-video.",4,3,4,22 August 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an amazing film and has Anderson pushing his talent and eye in new and creative directions.
","But there are a handful of directors who don't cater to money or studio execs, and continue to follow their vision and make amazing films. One that comes to mind is Quentin Tarantino. His films have always been consistently amazing and are always highly entertaining as well as incredibly well-made on every filmmaking level. Another director who follows this pattern is Wes Anderson. Each one of his films are consistently well-made, and are highly entertaining. In addition to that, both Anderson and Tarantino have a unique style that showcases them personally and their artistic mind.You can always tell just by looking at the visual image of a film if it was was directed by Anderson or Tarantino by how they use their camera. And if you turn on the sound, you can always tell by the score, music, and type of dialogue each of these fine directors write. When watching any Anderson movie, you are almost immediately transported into a whimsical and almost fairy tale like land with brilliant and witty characters that seem to be visions of old folklore and legend. Hell, even right down to the costumes, these characters that Anderson has created are iconic, as people dress up as them for Halloween each year.With Anderson's latest film, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', nothing is different, but everything is new in a big way. Anderson continues to wow us with his visual and audio style, even 13 films into his career without missing a step. It's very difficult to pick a favorite Wes Anderson film, and when I thought about this after someone asked me this question, I had to give it some thought. Now while 'Rushmore' and 'Royal Tenenbaums' hold a nostalgic value for me as these were the films that introduced me into Anderson's world, I'm gonna say that 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is my favorite Anderson film yet. And that's a bold statement coming from me, since his resume of films are all top notch. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is Anderson's WWII film.Like Tarantino made his WWII film with 'Inglorious Basterds' with it's own sense and re-writing of history, Anderson has made something similar. And boy, does it pay of on every level. Based on some stories by Stefan Zweig (who was born in the 1800s), this story follows a somewhat multi-generational plot of the owners and staff of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', which was a luxurious hotel back seventy years ago, but present day, can barely keep its lights on. The film is told in the form of a story over dinner by a man who supposedly owns the hotel and is one of the wealthiest people in the world.We travel back in time to the start of a fictional WWII where the Nazi party is called the Zig-Zag party. The Grand Budapest Hotel is in full swing with royalty, celebrities, and politicians partying, and staying for long weekends and events. The owner of the hotel has entrusted M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), a trusty 'head of staff' who services the high-end guests in more ways than one, particularly the elderly women. Gustave is in charge of every maid, server, clerk, and bell hop, and he runs a tight ship. One day, a young teenager who is named Zero (Tony Revolori) comes by the hotel in search of a job.Due to his determined attitude for perfection and willing to do anything for the job, Gustave takes him under his wing and makes him his assistant. One of the hotel's guest is a very wealthy elderly woman who comes to the hotel to get frisky with Gustave, and upon her latest visit, she tells him that she is scared for her life. Soon after that, she is found dead and Gustave is invited to her will reading, when he and her sinister family (Adrian Brody) and his bodyguard (Willem Dafoe) are angry that she left Gustave one of her paintings, which is valued in the millions of dollars. Wehn Brody and Dafoe try to make waves, Gustave and Zero steal the painting, which sets our story in motion that involves a thrilling snow ski chase, a prison escape, Nazis, a big gun battle in the hotel, and enough dry wit to last two films.This is more of a cat and mouse chase as Zero and Gustave are trying on the run from Brody and Dafoe, as they come into contact with quirky characters throughout who either end up dead or saving the day. There is a good side story of where Zero falls in love with a local girl who cooks at a great bakery as he shows his true loyalty and servitude to the job. Most of the Anderson regulars show up during the film, but only in small doses.The main people are Fiennes and Revolori, who give Oscar worthy performances. During the film, I had to remind myself that Gustave wasn't a real guy, and that it was Fiennes playing the role. It's that good. Being a war film, yes there is blood and gore, as well as some great gun sequences, but it is done in that famous Anderson style that makes it all seem magical. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an amazing film and has Anderson pushing his talent and eye in new and creative directions. If you see one movie this month, make it this one.",10,3,6,17 August 2015
Foxcatcher," While it might drag a bit, 'Foxcatcher' worth the dark journey to take this riveting ride.
","Director Bennett Miller has chosen his four films wisely. Starting with 'The Cruise' back in 1998, Miller has only three more films on his resume, including 'Foxcatcher'. The previous two were 'Capote' was an Oscar winner as well as 'Moneyball'. Miller has an uncanny knack for telling compelling stories that are based on real life events and engaging the audience to not only be entertained, but to think and discuss these characters and sometimes real people's motives in what they did in their particular story. You can add to that, Miller's success in getting his actors to win Oscars almost across the board, and this very dark and creepy film 'Foxcatcher' is no different.Written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman, 'Foxcatcher' has many layers that all fall into the disturbing, freakish, and ultimately tragic character study of one man. It's quite an emotional and difficult journey to take in the theater. One that is sometimes a bit on the slow side, but none-the-less, brilliant. And it is here, where you can see Steve Carell, virtually transform into one of the creepiest characters in recent memory.That story follows or shall I say centers on the story that shocked a nation back in the mid 1990s where a member of one of the wealthiest families in the world, John du Pont (Carell), murdered a longtime friend, gold medal Olympic winner in wrestling Dave Schultz, in cold blood. And Miller, Frye, and Futterman try to show us some of the motives that might have caused du Pont to commit this atrocious act. The film is actually told through the eyes of Dave Schultz's brother, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum), who also won the gold medal in wrestling at the 1984 Olympics with his brother.However, three years later, he is barely getting by in his small apartment and making money by trying to encourage elementary school kids to be excited about school and sports. His brother Dave (Mark Ruffalo), seems to be doing a bit better with his beautiful wife Nancy (Sienna Miller) and their young kids in Colorado. One thing is for sure though. Mark is a very hard worker and determined to be the best he can be, which is why he almost immediately accepts a first class ticket to to the du Pont estate to talk with John du Pont, an older and very creepy man with very pale skin and very unnerving eyes. His nose protrudes out quite far, but John always keeps it tilted upwards as if he's better than everyone else. It will take a minute, but this man is in fact Steve Carell under heavy makeup, and he just owns this unconventional role.From when du Pont starts to talk with Mark, you can tell the creepy factor is there, but his speeches are actually quite encouraging and patriotic, which is the key to getting Mark to sign on with du Pont as his coach and manager for future competitions. But it's very clear early on that du Pont has other motives. Du Pont is a weak person, both physically and mentally, with only his extreme wealth to shield him from anything harmful with the exception of his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and her love for horses, which he despises. In fact, if you met du Pont on the street, you would probably veer to the other side, but due to his money, he has been in the best school and best social circle, but alas, he has no friends.Only servants. After Mark wins a few contests, du Pont makes him a coach and sets up a compound on his property called Foxcatcher where they will find the best athletes in the wrestling world to compete in future Olympic games. But for some reason, du Pont turns on Mark, even calling him names, and enlists the help of his brother Dave to more or less take over. Over the course of this segment, du Pont more than just verbally abuses Mark. While it's never shown beyond that, it's definitely implied. The dynamic and relationships keep transforming and shifting between these three characters, so much so, that each relationship is very brutal to watch in its spiraling downfall, up until the horrid tragedy. But it makes for a very compelling experience, on that you can't believe actually happened.Miller has concocted a brilliant piece of storytelling and conjured up some award winning performances from his cast. While the film plays a bit slow at times, these performances and characters keep things very interesting and terrifying. The story is told over the course of a decade, and the editors and director did a fine job in connecting each big bit of the story together to tell us what just went through du Pont's mind that lead him to murder. Carell is one of the finest actors out there right now. I know we're all used to seeing him make us laugh and act goofy, but he is equally good at playing sadistic and creepy ,and it shows perfectly here with his mannerisms and speech. You'll feel your skin crawl every time he's on screen.Tatum turns in a very volatile and excellent performance as well. You can see the pain and agony on his face in every frame, and you just want him to do the right thing. And of course Ruffalo is amazing here as well, as he is the best friend everybody wished they had. He pulls it off with such genuine charisma, that it really is a punch in the stomach when we get to his untimely fate. 'Foxcatcher' is a well done film and a great addition to Miller's resume. While it might drag a bit, it's worth the dark journey to take this riveting ride.",8,3,4,12 August 2015
It Follows," The scariest and best horror film in years!
","It's very rare these days that a horror movie consistently delivers on genuine thrills and scares. And I'm not talking so much about the cheap 'jump out and scare you tactics'. I'm talking about a deep psychological horror that lingers in your mind for days after, causing you to look over your shoulder and think twice about those strange noises you heard. Not since 'The Babadook' has a movie been more terrifying than 'It Follows', which is a horror film from newcomer David Robert Mitchell who wrote and directed this masterpiece of horror.What works so well with 'It Follows' is its simplistic nature of the unknown. We never know why this terrifying situation is happening, but it is, and the characters have to deal with it, which makes it seem more realistic and grounded, considering there weren't a lot of major visual effects. The title focuses on something that follows you. It could be someone you know or a complete stranger and it has one goal. It wants to kill you. How does one become so lucky to have something follow you? The answer is sex.I thought Jason Vorhees from the 'Friday the 13th' franchise was the leader in pre- marital sex murders. He might still be the poster boy, but 'It Follows' is the new, fresh evil that awaits if you decide to go down that slippery, yet amazing slope. We follow a teenage girl named Jay (Maika Monroe from 'The Guest') who is out on a date with a guy named Hugh. As they are in the movie theater, having a good time, Hugh notices a strange girl staring at him and walking towards him. Jay cannot see her.Hugh quickly leaves with Jay, playing it off, saying he doesn't feel well. The couple heads to an abandoned warehouse where the have sex. Directly after their intimate session, Jay wakes up tied to a chair where Hugh tells her she has the curse, which now she sees someone following her. Hugh gives her a few instructions on how to stay alive and then leaves. Now, Jay starts seeing a variety of scary looking people, following her day and night as this entity is trying to savagely murder her.With the help of her friends and a young man named Paul (Keir Gilchrist from 'United States of Tara'), who has had a crush on Jay for years, the teens try to deal and run for their lives from this horror, while protecting Jay. David Robert Mitchell has given us a great set up for something that is truly scary. Each character has their own struggles and the dialogue between the circle of friends is the real thing. As the story progresses, so do the characters and their attempts to try and rid this evil from the world.Almost every viable option is tested, even the opportunities that would have us not look at Jay in a positive light. But that's the world of teenagers when it comes to sex, or at least that's the way I remember those younger years. 'It Follows' is an innovative and fresh addition to the horror genre. It's creepiness and terror lasts for days after viewing, making you look behind you to see if anyone is indeed following you.",10,6,21,21 July 2015
22 Jump Street," '22 Jump Street' is funny as hell and should be allowed to have ten more sequels.
","The movie theater chains across America are plagued with sequels, reboots, and remakes these days. It seems like almost every film out there is either a sequel or a remake of an older film, leaving the original indie films left out to dry for the more independent theaters or video-on-demand. While you want these sequels and remakes to be just as good as the original or first film, most of them fall a little short, or are down right terrible. There are only a select few sequels that receive the praise and box office power that have audiences across the globe cheering its name. And I'm happy to report that '22 Jump Street' falls into that category, maybe even being towards the top of that list.First off, the sequel to '21 Jump Street', now titled '22 Jump Street' is funny as hell. I lost my breath from laughter several times throughout the film. Almost everybody is back this time around to add to the hysterical comedy. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are back in the director's chair again, and have just come off their massive hit 'Lego Movie'. These two guys are definitely the future of filmmaking. They have a very successful track record so far and with this sequel that promises bigger action sequences, more cameos, and bigger stunts, they delivered on every level. One thing I love about this revamp of the hit TV show from the 80s, is that it is very self aware, as we are told by Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) that his 'department' is surprised that the first go-around of 'Jump Street' did so well, and since it passed people's expectations, there was going to be another case with a bigger budget in hopes of a good return (wink wink).'22 Jump Street' is directly across the street from '21 Jump Street', and instead of a Korean Jesus, we have a Vietnamese Jesus. Schmidt and Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) are enrolled in online college courses, looking for professor's who are using secret code in their lectures to inform people of drug deals. After a giant and hilarious car-chase that involves animal life, Schmidt and Jenko are back at 'Jump Street' in front of their boss Captain Dickson (Ice Cube, excellent), who informs them they are going to do the same thing as they did the first time around, only with better gear and more money.It's the same set-up, as the unlikely duo are sent undercover to a local college to investigate a new drug that recently killed a student, and is about to make its way across campuses around the nation. This time around, Schmidt and Jenko assume their alter egos Doug and Brad Mcquaid, but don't get them mixed up this time, as Schmidt is in art classes and Jenko tries out for football and is accepted into a fraternity. Meanwhile, Schmidt charms a nice girl named Maya (the beautiful Amber Stevens). The rest of the film plays out much like the first film did, but with even funnier jokes, and bigger action set pieces.Tatum and Hill's chemistry is off the charts. I think they are best friends in real-life, or at least it seems that way, and the two play off each other incredibly. Tatum just owns this role and has perfect comedic delivery, while Hill is the king of improv. Ice Cube receives more screen-time in this sequel, and still has me laughing as I write this and as you read this with some of the things his character did. Jillian Bell ('Workaholics') shows up too and proves that she is still one of the top comedic actresses in the business today.Possibly my only complaint is that I didn't think Maya's character was fleshed out all that well. I loved Brie Larson's character from the first film along with her charm and wit, but with Maya, things felt lazy. But that is so minor in the scheme of this excellent film, that you won't think twice about it. Be sure to stay through the incredible end credit sequence for a final scene. '22 Jump Street' is funny as hell and should be allowed to have ten more sequels.",8,1,3,15 August 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," . I hope you enjoy 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' as much as I did.
","I was half nervous and half excited for this sequel to one of my favorite superheroes to be released onto the world. I am a huge fan of the first film that came out a couple of years ago and thought that it was a solid reboot, even better than the original one from Sam Raimi. And I felt that it needed a reboot since the third Spidey film was one of the worst movies ever made. Needless to say, director Marc Webb and actor Andrew Garfield did a phenomenal job with their version of the web- slinger. The story was spot on, the script was solid, and the acting by everyone involved was terrific.Garfield brought multiple layers and likability to the Peter Parker/Spider-Man character that Tobey Maguire never did. And while I will always love Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, possibly because they have Bruce Campbell in them, I will always resort to these new ones, because they're just that much more fun and better made. But what got me nervous about this sequel is that when the trailers started airing, we saw bit by bit that there was going to be not one, not two, but three villains in this film. It seems like a lot of story line and character development to fit in the span of a couple of hours. Several directors have tried this before and have failed miserably. Luckily for all of us, Webb has done an outstanding job, concocting the story lines to produce a forward moving and fluid pace and story arc. The results are highly entertaining and and almost perfectly done.This sequel starts off with a flashback that shows us what actually happened to Peter Parker's parents and why they left him with his aunt and uncle, which is very similar to the opening of 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Then we are off swinging through the city with Spider-Man as he is trying to stop a mad man (Paul Giamatti) who is in a large truck full of some chemical, plowing through cars and people, evading the cops. Webb uses his camera so gracefully and perfectly that I could literally spend hours on end swinging with Spidey through the city. It's definitely a rush.It's graduation day as well and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) is number one in her class as Parker is trying to get to his own graduation to see her speech and walk across the stage an accept his diploma. Gwen and Peter still have a great relationship, but Peter still struggles with seeing visions of Gwen's dad (Denis Leary) throughout the day who reminds him to stay away from Gwen for her safety. This was really a low point of the movie and felt very cheesy, but was trying to foreshadow for later circumstances. After a chance encounter with Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), a nerdy employee at Oscorp who just wants a friend and to be noticed and Spider-Man, Dillon becomes a huge obsessive fan of the web-slinger. But when a freak accident transforms him into an electrical charged mutant who seems to resemble and have the same powers as Dr. Manhattan from 'The Watchmen', his temper gets the best of him and he wants to destroy the city and Spider-Man.Meanwhile, we see Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan, excellent) set by his father's (Chris Cooper) deathbed where Norman tells his son to carry on his legacy. Here is where we see Peter and Harry's friendship that has been strained over the years, but the two pick up right where they left off and seem to have a great time together, despite everything that has happened. Webb decided to make the whole Green Goblin aspect an organic virus that attacks the body and changes your skin and eyes rather than a suite. There is a whole lot of X-Men type stuff going on here in Spider-Man with people turning into mutants and what not.This Green Goblin virus kills you, but Norman tells Harry before he dies that there might be a certain type of spider venom to prolong his life or actually cure him, since this virus is hereditary. So Harry asks Parker is he can get in touch with Spider-Man for a chance at getting some of his blood for survival. It doesn't pan out so well for Harry so now it is Spider-Man vs. Electro and Green Goblin. The fight scenes are epic and a lot of fun to watch. Webb had Spider-Man use his web slinging abilities and surroundings to the fullest. I just can't wait to get back and watch these action scenes again.There are some flaws though with the film. Electro didn't seem to get the amount of time he deserved and should have been given a full movie to run with his character, instead of having to share with Green Goblin. And yes, Rhino is in the film, but not for more than a minute or two. I expect he will back in future sequels. But, Webb has big plans for the Goblin in future films as this one sets up perfectly as we get to see several other future villains for a split second. Other than that, the film was a solid sequel, and far better than what I though it was going to be. The Spider-Man one liners were excellent and funny and each relationship hit its mark. And of course, Stan Lee's cameo was brilliant as always. I hope you enjoy 'The Amazing Spider- Man 2' as much as I did.",7,1,4,17 August 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," 'Pawn Sacrifice' is definitely worth your time.
","We've seen many stories, films, and television specials about Bobby Fischer, who has a reputation for being the greatest Chess player to ever walk the Earth. It's also well documented on how Fischer fell into madness and became a recluse from his paranoia until his death in 2008. Fischer was for sure a strange and chaotic man, but he was also a genius and fairly charismatic when he wanted to be. Needless to say, Bobby Fischer's life is as interesting as it is sad and is worth telling, which is why so many people have told it over the years.But with director Edward Zwick's ('Glory', 'Legends of the Fall', 'Blood Diamond', 'The Last Samurai') excellent ability to tell a story and Steven Knight's ('Locke', 'Eastern Promises') fantastic, yet brutal script, we finally get to the bottom of Bobby Fischer's descent into madness as he's challenging the Russians to a game of chess for the world championship in 'Pawn Sacrifice'. This is somewhat of a biographical film, and although it does show a young Bobby Fischer for a short amount of time on screen, the film's main focus is over the span of a couple of years where we start to see Bobby (Tobey Maguire) show signs of his mental illness and challenge Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber) to the world championship of Chess.At first, we see Bobby as a very charming young man who loves to talk to the press when he wants to, exuding an almost Muhammed Ali vibe about talking about his talent and opponents. On the other hand, he can be as vicious and cruel to anyone around him if he doesn't get his way, which at times is very unreasonable. This is where Tobey Maguire shines. I've always enjoyed watching Maguire on screen and he's come a long way since his days as Spider-Man. Maguire lets it all hang out here as he struggles with his illness and rocky life in the limelight, which at the time, he was one of the most famous people in the world. Not only that, but he was the poster boy for the United States of America, beating the Russians during the end of the Cold War.After quitting and losing to the Russians and claiming they cheated, Fischer chose to retire from chess, however a lawyer/manager/'friend' in Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlberg) talked Fischer into beating the Russians in a series of games for the World Championship on a lengthy list of demands. To accompany Fischer on his journey to maintain his sanity was long time friend and 'only person to have beaten him at chess' was William Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard), a priest who enjoys drinking and smoking, and of course playing chess. The banter with these guys is quite fun, but at times very sincere as they want the best for their friend Bobby, but as we learned, the greatest chess player of all time would do what he wanted, when he wanted, and became paranoid that the government, Russians, and Jews were out to get him, even though he was Jewish himself.I did like that Zwick gave us some little hints that probably some of the greatest minds in chess all had some sort of insanity in showing that Boris Spassky showed signs to of paranoia, and that it wasn't just Fischer. With an excellent screenplay and a fantastic performance by Tobey Maguire, which might give him some attention come award season, 'Pawn Sacrifice' is definitely worth your time.Recommended!",7,2,5,16 September 2015
Big Hero 6," But is 'Big Hero 6' worth seeing? One-hundred percent Yes it is!
","Disney's CG animation department is on a huge winning streak. With the success of 'Wreck It Ralph' and 'Frozen', Disney is back in the animation game after a long absence while Pixar did their thing. Dinsey's latest animated adventure is called 'Big Hero 6', and is based off an old Marvel Comics title. I can safely say that 'Big Hero 6' is a big winner and continues Disney's streak of success.This heartwarming and thrilling story takes place in a futuristic city called San Fransokyo and follows a young boy with a pension for science and a gentle vinyl balloon robot that acts as a Professional Health Care Provider. Directors Don Hall and Chris Williams have perfectly concocted a great group of characters and woven a storyline that appeals to all ages and sexes. While yes, there are robots and superheroes, there is also a high level of emotional issues to keep you invested deeply with every character.The young boy we follow is a 14-year old Wiz-Kid who graduated High School at 13 named Hiro (Ryan Potter), who would rather enter his BattleBot in underground contests for money than get a real education. His older brother Tadashi (Daniel Henney) tries to keep him on the right track by showing him his college, lab, inventions, and friends. But an accident puts everything on hold and Hiro takes solace in Tadashi's newest invention - Baymax (Scott Adsit), a bit vinyl balloon robot who acts as a gentle doctor.However, this accident might not be an accident, but rather homicide, and Hiro takes upon himself to solve the mystery when he comes across a super villain with a Kabuki mask. In order to take down this villain, he upgrades Baymax and uses the help of his new friends GoGo (Jamie Chung), Wasabi (Damon Wayans Jr.), Honey Lemon (Genesis Rodriguez), and Fred (T.J. Miller), who all become fun superheroes to take out the bad guys. Each character is distinguishable on their own and each pack some good laughs.The big action sequences are thrilling and a lot of fun, but don't pack big pop that previous Pixar movies have. The animation and CG effects are quite amazing and the part Tokyo, part San Francisco skyline is gorgeous, making each color pop off screen. There is enough heart and soul in 'Big Hero 6' to appease every age here, and enough laughs to go around twice.And don't forget to stick around till after end credits for a spectacular sequence with a big cameo. Also, the film is preceded by another excellent animated short film called 'Feast', which shows the span of a family's life through the eyes of their pet dog. It's amazing and Oscar worthy. But is 'Big Hero 6' worth seeing? One-hundred percent Yes it is!",8,8,10,12 August 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Best Marvel movie to date. This is a MUST-SEE!
","It seems like Marvel has a formula in motion that combines critically acclaimed performances and effects with box office success, which is a rare feat these days. Then along comes a movie based on the Marvel Comics called 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which I'm sure most of you never read or heard of before this movie started being made. Marvel Studios decided to go a different route with this film and gamble on the 'not-so-big-names' and a different kind of script and story than it's previous flicks. Not since 'The Avengers' has there been this amount of visual effects or a big super-hero team like this one, and Marvel is betting big that it makes 'Avengers' type money in the long run. And I'm here to say that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is my favorite Marvel movie to date, and I'm betting it will make the big box office splash that Hollywood so desperately needs this summer. Yes, it really is that good.If you are unfamiliar with the story of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', they were first introduced back in 1969 in Marvel Comics, but it was a different team than you see on screen and in comics today. No, not until 2008, did the new team appear in comics, which is what this new film is based on and writer/director James Gunn knocked it out of the ballpark. Gunn got his start with the infamous movie group 'Troma', but then went on to write a great superhero indie film called 'The Specials' (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED), then went on to write the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' in 2004, followed by directing 'Slither', 'Super', 'PG Porn', and now 'Guardians of the Galaxy'. Needless to say, it's an odd choice by Marvel, but none-the-less the perfect choice.'Guardians of the Galaxy' is about a rag-tag group of people (some aliens from other planets and one human), who decide to team up and fight evil across the galaxy. The team is lead by a human named Peter Quill who calls himself Star Lord (Chris Pratt), who spends his time working for an intergalactic thief Yondu (Michael Rooker), stealing objects of great value from different planets and selling them for a hearty bounty. Little does he know that one of the objects in his possession is sought after by the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) and Ronan (Lee Pace), who plan on using the object to kill off entire planets. When a beautiful alien named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) tries to take the stolen object from Quill, they run into Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel), a raccoon that has been modified to walk, talk, shoot guns, and has a pension of danger, and a magical tree that can grow to any size and be a huge asset in a fight.The four of them are arrested and taken to prison where the meet Drax The Destoryer (WWE's Dave Bautista), where he informs them that he is after Ronan for killing his family. The five new 'friends' all seem to have the same goal in common and escape prison to head out to stop Ronan, while figuring out that by sticking together, they can fight evil and save innocent lives. Gunn's script is truly satisfying, as he has enough time to dive into each character's psyche and make them vulnerable. This makes us take the journey and care about each character throughout. His unique humor in the script has perfect timing and is very different and more adult for a Marvel movie, which should satisfy a lot of people. Look out for the Jackson Pollock joke.And the visual effects are stunning. From the huge spaceship battles on different planets to the excellent practical makeup effects on the aliens, they all look flawless. Rocket the Raccoon and Groot look amazing and fluid and make Gollum from 'Lord of the Rings' look like chicken scratch. James Gunn did not disappoint with a $170 million dollar budget film. Chris Pratt just owns this film too and is the next big action star. His sincerity and humor are solid gold and you root for him every step of the way. You believe he is just a regular fun guy, but when he has to fight, you believe that he can indeed kick some serious ass. Zoe Saldana does and impressive job here too, as she always does. Dave Bautista does a magnificent job as the hulk of a species who is hell bent on revenge and takes everything literally, which plays to great comic effect through his delivery. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel's voice work is amazing as Rocket and Groot with Lee Pace coming in nicely as the villain.Cameos from John C. Reilly, Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close, and Benicio Del Toro are all excellent and am sure will have bigger parts in the next films. During the Benicio Del Toro scene, keep a look out for other heroes. Tyler Bates's score and the abundance of 80s and 90s rock music is superb here and might be the best soundtrack I have heard from a movie in a long time. You'll find yourself singing and swaying in your movie seats, and to end the film with a Jackson Five song is pure brilliance. Again, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is my favorite and dare I say it, Best Marvel movie to date. This is a MUST-SEE!",9,2,5,15 August 2015
Evil Dead," 'Evil Dead' is scary as hell.
","Much like the rest of you, I followed along and reported the up-to-news as I got it in on everything having to do with this remake, and I have to say, that I was apprehensive to a lot of it. Having newcomer director Fede Alvarez fill the might shoes of Raimi, and not having Bruce Campbell reprise his role of Ash, or even having an Ash character had me scared and annoyed that this glorious remake that I have wanted for so long was going down the tubes. And the fact that Campbell, Raimi, and Tapert were only producing the flick had me even more worried as they might not be on set every day to make sure things were running smoothly. Luckily, after a little production time had passed, we reported that the trio was very hands on in every aspect of production. Then came that infamous scary trailer and after viewing, my mind was at ease as all my worries disappeared and I knew we were going to get the 'Evil Dead' we deserved, even if it didn't have Bruce Campbell as Ash.'Evil Dead' is scary as hell.Alvarez with the help of Raimi conjured up a spectacular remake that would make the original proud. There are tons of homages and throwbacks to the original two movies and enough of the same story line to know what is to happen next, however, this remake has a few curve balls that it will throw in your direction, along with enough blood and guts to make Peter Jackson squirm.As in the original film, we focus on a group of 20 somethings who journey off to a remote cabin in the woods. However this time, it's not for a fun vacation. Instead, the group of friends are here for a girl named Mia (Jane Levy) who has a serious drug habit who they are planning a detox and intervention. Her group of friends have even enlisted the help of her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), who has been off for the past few years doing his own thing and not once thought to call his sister or his friends. Something doesn't smell right though, and soon enough someone finds the book of the dead and even though the book is wrapped in plastic with barbed wire, and in the pages it says DO NOT READ, the passages are read and all hell breaks loose and there is sure to be some swallowed souls.Fede Alvarez will be a household name soon. He packed enough confidence in taking the reins of this iconic fan favorite and made it his own. In return, we get a no-holds barred gore fest that has great acting, plenty of genuine scares, and a treasure trove of scenes that will have you covering your eyes in horror. Alvarez keeps the tone close to the first film in that it is serious with no silly gags that will make you laugh. If you indeed do laugh during this remake, it will only be the nervous kind of laughter, not because something was funny.There is no CG blood in this remake. Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell made sure to secure a generous budget and decent shooting schedule to create the perfect atmosphere for real effects using gallons upon gallons of real-fake blood. The result is very satisfying as us as an audience can always tell the CG blood from the real blood, and somehow I always feel slighted and taken away from the film because of this. As if it didn't happen and the actors didn't get dirty or hurt in any way. That's not the case here. There are plenty of flesh cutting scenes that involve tongues, eyes, and other various limbs that will make you scream out in the theater for it to stop.The acting was surprisingly very good this time around. Yes, I know, Bruce 'man- god' Campbell is the greatest thing in the world, but he wasn't the best actor back in the 80s. Here, we have relatively new actors who all turn in very solid performances and are very believable as each one of them meets a gruesome and violent death. The cream of the crop here is Jane Levy, who seriously terrified me to no end. She plays a cool enough girl who has some problems, but is always very charming. However, when things take a turn for the worst for her and she turns into a deadite, her voice and body language will haunt my nightmares for quite some time.From cutting off your own hand, to a nail gun, to it literally raining blood from the sky, 'Evil Dead' is a very satisfying and fun experience at the theater. An experience you don't want to be alone at, but rather view the film with friends. I'm sure you will all pick up on all the 'head nods' to the original film throughout the entire film. And when you're not on the edge of your seat and covering your eyes from the pure and unadulterated horror that is on the screen, you will find yourself clapping at moments when someone sees a chainsaw or reloads a boomstick.'Evil Dead' is some of the most fun I have had at the theater in a long time and I can't wait to see it again. And don't forget to stay in your seat till after the final credits roll, as you will be treated to something very special.",8,1,3,2 September 2015
Jurassic World," 'Life finds a way.'
","It's been 14 years since we've stepped foot inside 'Jurassic Park' and got to witness all the wonder and terror of the magnificent creatures called dinosaurs. I think it's pretty safe to say that the first film has been the best in the franchise so far with parts II and III falling behind in terms of overall enjoyment. However, this new reboot of the franchise comes a close second to the first film, as it seems like a 14 year sequel to part I and forgetting the last two films ever happened, which is not necessarily a bad thing.Stepping up to the plate as director this time is Colin Trevorrow, who must have impressed Steven Spielberg with his first hit film 'Safety Not Guaranteed', which was a slow burn sci-fi movie that was quite brilliant. Bits of Trevorrow's insight and style are infused in 'Jurassic World', but this being a big summer blockbuster, it has a more action packed formulaic presence than what we're used to with Trevorrow's work. That being said, 'Jurassic World' still packs the usual suspenseful moments and thrills that come with giant dinosaurs breaching their contained walls and wreaking havoc. What's different and fun this time around is that the 'park' is now a fully functioning theme park similar to the likes of Disney World, complete with tons of big hotels, restaurants, attractions, guided tours, and over 20,000 people waiting in line to get a glimpse at their favorite dinosaur.The person in charge of the park is Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a woman who is all business and no play, and who would rather raise profits than keep the guests and dinosaurs safe and healthy. She even doesn't pay attention to her two nephews Gray and Zach (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson), when they visit her and the park for their first time. In order to raise profits a fraction of a percent, she and new owner of the park Simon (Irrfan Khan) have secretly cross-bred a variety of dinosaurs to make a scary, gigantic new dinosaur that promises to scare the masses, which should boost profits. This being a 'Jurassic Park' movie, things are not all happy and friendly.The giant monster dinosaur gets loose and due to its molded DNA, has a few special tricks up its sleeve, most of which are bad news for any dinosaur or human. Luckily, there is a guy who works on the island named Owen (Chris 'Star Lord' Pratt) who has figured out that dinosaurs can form relationships with humans, specifically the velociraptors, in which he can communicate and train them as if they were pet dogs, and might be able to stop the big dinosaur from wreaking havoc with their help.Meanwhile, a man named Vic (Vincent D'Onofrio), the head security official in charge of InGen, has a hidden agenda in place for the raptors. 'Jurassic World' is best when the dinosaurs are attacking and that certain level of suspense we've come to expect with the 'Jurassic Park' movies. Where it doesn't work is with the multiple story lines that never seem to move past beyond their initial introductory stage. Even the two kids of the film are problematic in that we don't spend enough time with them to really enjoy their characters.Needless to say, the main star here is Pratt, who makes us believe he is capable of running with the raptors and can still be very charming and funny throughout. Yes, most of the characters here make very dumb decisions, but hey, it's a 'Jurassic Park' movie. We need those stupid moments to have a film at all. 'Jurassic World' is also self aware of the movie it is, referencing the previous events in a funny manner, which is always welcomed. Michael Giacchino did a great job with the score as he built upon John Williams's iconic music for the film, which makes an appearance as well. 'Jurassic World' still doesn't hold a candle to the first film, but comes in at a close second for thrills. Jeff Goldblum said it best, 'Life finds a way.'Recommended!",7,0,5,27 July 2015
Prisoners," I have no doubt that you'll leave this movie shaken for at least a couple of days, and I won't be surprised if 'Prisoners' were to be recognized come Oscar season.
","Denis Villeneuve (director of the Oscar-nominated 'Incendies') has given us one hell of a terrifying and highly suspenseful ride with his first major Hollywood film, 'Prisoners'. The movie has an amazing cast and an excellent script.It seems like almost every week, we hear a news story about a child in our neighborhood, town or city that has gone missing. The reactions and damage this causes the families feel all too real and scary in the film, which features violence and suspense that never let up.The movie begins with Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) teaching his son how to kill a deer for sport and food. It's an interesting and haunting scene. Next, Keller and his family head over to the home of their neighbors (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving dinner. While the mothers prepare the food, the husbands talk about work and sports, the older teenagers watch TV, and the two young daughters of the families play around the house.As the Thanksgiving afternoon goes on, the two girls venture outside to play, but they never come back. The older kids noticed a creepy old mobile home parked out front during the day, and now everyone panics for the worst. The police are called, and Det. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes the lead in the case. The cops soon find the mobile home a few miles away and arrest the owner, Alex Jones (Paul Dano). However, Alex has the intellect of a ten-year-old, and is released a couple days later due to lack of evidence, even though he whispers incriminating evidence about the two missing girls directly to Keller.Keller observes Alex's weird behavior and is convinced that he's responsible for the abduction. Since the police aren't doing anything about him, Keller takes matters into his own hands by kidnapping Alex and torturing him to get answers. Meanwhile, Loki pursues other leads to find the missing girls, including Alex's aunt (Melissa Leo) and a strange man obsessed with mazes.'Prisoners' is as scary and suspenseful as 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac' put together. The film draws amazing performances from Gyllenhaal and Jackman. Both men show just how far they will go for their families and jobs, even if it makes them the bad guys. Dano is terrific playing an innocent yet highly creepy guy. You never know what he has up his sleeve.Villeneuve's direction is beautiful and haunting as he takes us through the gritty and grimy underbelly of two seemingly normal families during the worst part of their lives. I have no doubt that you'll leave this movie shaken for at least a couple of days, and I won't be surprised if 'Prisoners' were to be recognized come Oscar season.",8,1,2,22 August 2015
Silence," 'Silence is Golden'!
","Martin Scorsese certainly has had a fantastic career in film. From films like 'Raging Bull' to 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', to 'Taxi Driver', 'The Departed', and the recent 'Wolf of Wall Street' – it's easy to say that Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers still out there today. Scorsese may be know for a lot of gangster and super violent films over his career, but he has made a variety of other movies in different genres, including the recent kid's film 'Hugo'. He is also a big supporter in world cinema, making it easier for people around the world to experience new filmmakers from other countries. One genre Scorsese is fairly into is the religion genre.Back in 1988, Scorsese made 'The Last Temptation of Christ', which won some awards and went on to be one of the most talked about movie of its time. Fast forward to present day and we have a brand new religious film from Scorsese called 'Silence', based on the 1966 novel of the same name. This film is set in 17th century Japan where two Jesuit Portuguese priests travel to Japan in order to look for their missing fellow priest, who hasn't been heard of in some time. This is cause for great concern, because Japan at the time, was against Christianity, and would kill people violently if they believed in the Christian God. Scorsese's films usually clock in at around the three hour mark. With 'Silence' is is about twenty minutes shy of that three hour milestone, but don't be fooled by the short time stamp.This is a very slow burn film, which takes its time going places. That's not to say that's a bad thing, but it's not as fast paced as let's say 'Wolf of Wall Street'. Scorsese has perfectly crafted a historical drama that captures every essence of the time period and location, as well as, having a strong message without being at all preachy or conforming to one religion, which is always most welcome. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver play both Jesuit priests named Rodrigues and Garrpe respectively, as they trek to Japan secretly to find their mentor Ferreira played by Liam Neeson. Rodrigues and Garrpe must literally hide from everyone, with the exception of the very poor villagers who consider themselves Christians and hide them in a small hut.Over time, both priests have to begin their search again for their missing fellow priest, but are captured and are mentally and physically tortured. Their captors aren't all that bad in a sense, as they try to make Rodrigues understand where they are coming from, while trying to understand him. They stick by their word in that if the Christian believers just step on a stone that depicts their God, they can go free, but that isn't always the case. Rodrigues is the focal point of the story here too as his faith is always tested in many different ways, until he realizes that he can still believe in something without shouting it to the world.Neeson and Driver are excellent in their roles, but don't have a lot of screen time, specifically Neeson. It's a wonder he is top billed at all. Garfield is excellent here. His emotions are raw and true, however his Portuguese accent comes and goes throughout the movie. Scorsese framed this film perfectly as every shot looks beautiful and amazing, even with scenes that involve death. 'Silence' for sure is a slow paced and long film, but the journey to the end is very rewarding, making this Scorsese film one to be remembered and proving at the age of 74, he can still put out amazing films and art that means something.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,5,11,23 January 2017
Logan," 'Logan' is the 'Wolverine' film we've always wanted!
","For decades now, we have been clamoring for a 'Wolverine' film done right. From his first incarnation in Hulk #181 to his own miniseries in comic book form in the 1980's by Frank Miller, to the amazing Saturday Morning Cartoon, and his first appearance in a feature film in 2000 with 'X-Men', which had the song and dance man Hugh Jackman play the iconic character. He was so good at playing Logan/Wolverine, that fans immediately took a liking to him as that character and he went on to play the 'Snikt-y Snikt' character in almost a dozen more films. Besides the 'X-Men' films, Wolverine got his own set of standalone films, which may or may not have been liked by a lot of people for various reasons. Either the story was too silly or the character Wolverine was to PG for fans.If anyone knows the Wolverine character, it's that he's a brutal, violent, hardcore rated R character, which is something we haven't seen in cinema form at least. That is until now with James Mangold's new film 'Logan', which is very much an R-rated movie, complete with blood, ultra-violence, nudity, and vulgar language. It's everything we've always wanted in a Wolverine movie – FINALLY! With the past three X-Men films, we've seen our favorite X-Men characters growing up as it served as the prequel to the 2000 film. 'LOGAN' is set in the year 2029 and the world has changed for the worst, at least for a mutant friends. This is a very bleak, dark, and violent film with some flashes of dark humor. Nobody is doing well in 2029 here, particularly Logan (Hugh Jackman) who has crawled inside a whisky bottle and has never came back out, with the exception of driving a limo for cash around town. He's old, mean, and his body is starting to fail him. When he's not driving or killing people, he takes care of Charles Xavier (Sir Patrick Stewart), who is suffering from seizures and dementia, and who lives in a rusted out, abandoned water tower. Life is not good here for anyone.Meanwhile, a little girl named Laura (Dafne Keen) crosses paths with Logan who seems to have the same abilities as the Wolverine himself. Logan is now charged with the task of transporting this little girl to a safe haven with Charles in tow, as a group of bad guys are after her, led by Dr. Zander Rice (Richard E. Grant). It's a fairly straight forward story and it takes its time setting up these older, dying characters, as well as its new ones. 'LOGAN' doesn't mess about with side tangent plot lines or love interests here. It's balls-to-the-wall, heart breaking action and drama, which is something we've wanted for a long time now with the Wolverine character. The script is written by Scott Frank ('Get Shorty, 'Minority Report') and Michael Green ('Heroes', 'Gotham'), which these two writers have expertly added in a fair dose of emotion into these characters, but never back pedal into past films. It was a breath of fresh air. James Mangold certainly was influenced by some of his favorite old western films, as can be seen in some of camera shots, which are just fantastic.Also, if you ever wanted to see Wolverine go berserk, you'll finally get that here on more than one occasion, complete with some long shots of Wolverine slicing and dicing the bad guys without any cuts. Simply amazing. In the past films, we've seen the characters Professor Xavier and Wolverine rather smart, witty, and put together for the most part. That's not the case here. These two characters are very sick and are not doing well mentally and physically. Jackman and Stewart give award worthy performances here, which might bring a tear or two down your face. It's that good. Newcomer Dafne Keen as Laura was also fantastic and very believable in every second she's on film. 'LOGAN' runs at about 135 minutes, which can seem a bit long, but everything is necessary here and for good reason. 'LOGAN' is the Wolverine film we've always wanted and it deserves some high recognition.",9,114,246,17 February 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the Avengers movie we need, but not the one we necessarily deserve.
","To basically start out the summer of 2015 with a big bang, comes the highly anticipated sequel to Marvel's 2012's 'Avengers' film, which is titled 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. It's been a long time coming too. Ever since 2008, when we saw Robert Downey Jr. put on the Iron Man suit for the first time, we all knew Marvel Entertainment had a huge franchise on their hands, as they teased a big film called 'The Avengers', which put a lot of our favorite superheroes together to fight evil. After several solo movies with the likes of Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man, we finally got an 'Avengers' movie in 2012, which made over $1 billion for Marvel and Disney, and was met with much praise and critical success. It was because of this, that Marvel has announced tons of superhero films through the year 2019 that will play into their overall story arc they have been building since 2008. We've all been anxiously awaiting this sequel for quite some time now, with tons of posters and trailers that have more than elevated our calm levels with excitement. Now the time is finally here for another hefty dose of 'Avengers' with each superhero returning along with Joss Whedon directing.First off, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the Avengers movie we need, but not the one we necessarily deserve, to quote a certain police commissioner. Don't get me wrong, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a good movie. The characters, the dialogue, and of course the action are all very strong, with a huge emphasis on the action aspect. Other than that, there is no real character development with the exception of one character, and the whole Marvel Universe doesn't seem to move forward with anything. Instead, it seems like Marvel and Disney just wanted to show big action scene after big action scene for this sequel, which is why I said it's the film we need. I say this because the first 'Avengers' film spent most of the movie gathering these heroes to fight together, and only in the last 20 minutes of the film did we get to see everyone in action at the same time. So it was great to see all of our favorite heroes, win the fight, party afterwards, and have a few jokes with one another, specifically everyone trying to pick up Thor's hammer.So why is the film called 'Age of Ultron'? Well, Tony Stark creates a new artificial intelligence program that he dubs Ultron, which is like Jarvis, but has the ability to be 1000 times more powerful. This program manifests itself into one of Stark's backup Iron Man machines and is voiced by the amazing James Spader. This new program is supposed to protect the Earth from any threat, but Ultron himself thinks that the extinction of the human race is the way to save itself and create peace. As Ultron is literally getting smarter and stronger by the second, 'The Avengers' have a tough time trying to take him down, which leads us on a journey of several epic fight scenes. One of the redeeming qualities here is the amount of time we get to spend with Hawkeye. He's the only real character who is paid attention to in detail here and moves forward with his story. I know that the other heroes have had their own films, but in 'Age of Ultron', it only seems that they are there to fight the bad guys. Except Hawkeye, whom we find out has a family on rural farm and knows all about his 'avenging'.There was a bit of a side storyline of Black Widow and Hulk possibly giving it the olé college try in a relationship, but it's difficult to say where any of it was going. Perhaps another sequel will tell us. Then we have three new characters introduced to the Avengers, which are Quicksilver (Aaron-Taylor Johnson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Vision (Paul Bettany). You saw Quicksilver in the last 'X-Men' movie last year, played by a different actor, whereas Scarlet Witch is a bad-ass here and as we find out can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Lastly, there is Vision, one of the coolest heroes, who is the complete opposite of Ultron, but just as powerful. Where Ultron wants to only destroy, Vision wants to protect and save.The look of Vision is amazing. They really knocked his practical effects and makeup out of the park. Joss Whedon's script is great for the amount of action this movie has. When we do get a bit of dialogue between two characters, the brilliance and wit of Whedon's mind comes full force, specifically when Hawkeye is trying to tell Scarlet witch just how ridiculous everything is. This was a great moment that made me think back to Whedon's television days. James Spader was born to play the role of Ultron. His voice and mannerism are haunting and scary-as-hell. If they gave voice acting Oscars, Spader would be in the running.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is not the movie we deserved, because this film did not forward to the story of the Marvel Universe one bit, nor did it have those special 'wow' moments from the first film. Instead, we get some pretty fantastic and epic action scenes with all of our heroes fighting together for over two hours. It doesn't necessarily make for a bad movie, but just not an excellent one that we thought we'd be getting. And yes, there is a big tease during the credits of the film, so be sure to stay in your seats to see who pops up and where Marvel is going.",7,3,8,6 May 2015
Everest," 'Everest' is intense as hell and reassures me that I'll never want to climb that mountain.
","Based on the 1996 Mount Everest Disaster where several climbers lost their lives, director Baltasar Kormákur ('2 Guns') shows us what happened in those days that led up to that horrifying experience. I consider myself a little bit of a daredevil here and there. I love to bungee jump whenever I can, although I admit it's been a while since I have, but I don't think I have the guts to climb a mountain like Everest, which is the tallest mountain on the globe at almost 30,000 feet in the air. But year after year, people trek out there and climb it and succeed, where others don't.'Everest' plays out like two separate films.The first half introduces us to our climbers in 1996, including a doctor from Dallas Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin), a mailman Doug Hansen (John Hawkes), journalist John Krakauer (Michael Kelly), and Everest guides Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), who implore to their civilian climbers that they need to rest up and train their bodies to weather the harsh and dangerous conditions of climbing Everest. The guides even tell them that once they are at a certain altitude, their bodies literally begin to shut down and die and that it's imperative to reach the top and get back down the mountain in a certain time frame.So in this first half, we see the bonds and the triumphs of climbing the mountain, making it from camp to camp as each climber struggles to breathe and make it higher. There are a couple of scenes that are fairly intense with swooping camera angles that look down off the mountain that would make anybody feel dizzy and hold onto their seat arms. However, the turning point here is once several climbers reach the glorious peak of Everest and start their descent down, when a bad storm hits ferociously upon the climbers, which ultimately kills several people off.This second half is so intense and packed with a mighty sound from the IMAX speakers that I literally thought I was in the middle of this storm as well, and found myself bracing the seat in a panic. It almost seems like these people were on another planet, as most of us have never seen terrain or weather like these people experienced. Since this is a true story, we all know what happens, and it's heartbreaking to watch the inevitable as Kormákur shows us the final moments with each climber and the base camp notifying their families.Towards the end of the film, this aspect seems to drag the pace of the movie down and goes on a bit too long, but some might think it's a nice and refreshing breather from the chaos that came before it. Kormákur did an excellent job with his camera-work here, making us feel like we were actually on top of that mountain, in addition to giving us enough time with each key player here, although we center mostly on Rob Hall and Josh Brolin most of the time, which is unfortunate, because Gyllenhaal's character of Scott Fischer seemed to be more interesting and conflicted than anyone else, but he's a side player here.I'm not sure why the film was in 3D, as nothing really popped out, other than the depth of the land, but the IMAX screening was fantastic as well as the roaring sound. 'Everest' is intense as hell and reassures me that I'll never want to climb that mountain.Recommended!",8,3,7,16 September 2015
Elysium," 'Elysium' loses interest quickly and fails to be very fun or entertaining.
","With 'District 9', Neill Blomkamp quickly became one of my favorite directors. He not only created a realistic world infested with aliens, the film's acting, action and politically-conscious story were nothing short of excellent. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about his second feature, 'Elysium'. While the sci-fi flick has some good moments, it's mostly wasted on lackluster storytelling.In the year 2154, Earth has become overpopulated. People live in filth, work for crime lords, and are desperate to find food or health-care. Meanwhile, just a stone's throw away is a giant space station called Elysium, where the wealthy live in huge mansions surrounded by golf courses and over sized pools. More importantly, in every home is a machine that can fix any health issue, including cancer, severed limbs, old age and even death. Yes, residents of Elysium can live forever. Of course, the poor people on Earth don't have access to these machines.The story follows Max (Matt Damon), a factory worker hoping for a shot to go to Elysium some day. After an accident exposes him to deadly radiation, Max learns that he only has five days to live. Desperate to get to one of those healing machines on Elysium, he enlists the help of a crime boss, who outfits him with a mechanical exoskeleton that gives him super strength. Elsewhere, Delacourt (Jodie Foster), one of the executives running Elysium, is charged with keeping the people of Earth from entering the space station, even if that means killing children. She's even hired a sadistic killer (Sharlto Copley) on Earth to help her with this job. Now, it's up to Max to save himself as well as the people of Earth.One of the main problems with 'Elysium' is its story structure. We don't spend enough time with Damon's character to really connect with him. He doesn't seem like a particularly great guy, and his full back story is never truly revealed. Instead, we're rushed into action scene after action scene. The third act falls apart with too many things going on at once, and wraps up with a half-assed ending that could have been much more powerful.The visuals and design are of course top-notch. The futuristic cars, robotic police officers and Elysium itself look phenomenal. Damon does a decent job, but seems a bit one-note. Copley makes a great bad guy, even if his accent is hard to understand at times. But then there's Jodie Foster. Good grief. She deserves a Razzie Award for this performance. It's downright laughable and almost ruins the movie completely.Other than a few decent fight scenes and some amazing visual effects, 'Elysium' loses interest quickly and fails to be very fun or entertaining. Yes, we get that Blomkamp wants to make a political message about free universal health-care and the wrongs of the class system, but there are better ways to tell that story.",3,0,2,23 August 2015
Selma," 'Selma' is a powerhouse of a film and stays with you long after you see it. Don't miss this film.
","It's no doubt that Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most influential people in the world. He fought for basic human rights, received a Nobel Peace Prize, and not only changed a nation for good, but changed the world. This film is not necessarily a biopic on iconic man, but rather a glimpse on a short period of time that focuses on the 1965 voting marches from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama, that was to ensure that anyone, no matter your race, color, creed, or religion, could have the right to vote.These marches and peaceful demonstrations were well documented by the press back then and eventually led to President Lyndon B. Johnson changing the law so that everyone had to right to vote in any election without hassle. And this film 'Selma' shows us the hardships, violence, brilliance, and struggles of Martin and his followers and believers for a better place to live. It's an emotional roller coaster for sure, but with its award winning performance by David Oyelowo ('Interstellar') and great camera work, 'Selma' hits all the right notes, despite a few pacing problems.We start out with Martin receiving his Nobel Peace Prize, as the master of ceremonies tells us and him that the world knows and loves the work he is doing. Once back in the states, Martin heads to the White House again to talk with President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) about singing a law into effect to allow the black voters the right to vote without hassle, which Johnson doesn't do. Concurrently, while it is legal for the black population to vote, the law enforcement and people who work at the voter booths are not allowing them to vote for prejudice reasons, particularly in the South. That is when Martin and his people head to Selma to stage a demonstration until the law is passed.Martin picks Selma, because he knows their law enforcement are violent assholes who have no love for human life, but are blinded by hatred for something they don't know. Knowing that his followers will show peaceful demonstrations and marches, he is willing to bet that the white law enforcement will show brutal violence with the hopes of these acts of chaos will be shown on live TV for the world to see, forcing the President to make a move. His strategy worked, but not without some pain and sorrow.Director Ava Duvernay shows us just how horrible and violent these marches were, and it's hard to watch in certain moments as we ask ourselves, 'Were we really capable of this?' And we quickly think, 'Yes, and it still goes on today.' The main issue I had with 'Selma' was that were too many moments that slowed the film down due to a long shot of someone looking intense into the camera or into the wide open. I get why these moments were there, but it seemed to happen after each scene. But it's a minor complaint in an otherwise excellent film.David Oyelowo plays Martin Luther King Jr. flawlessly. Not only do we see his strengths in speeches and rallying people for good, but we also see his internal struggle with his family and own willingness to carry out his life's work. Oyelowo definitely deserves some awards for this role. Thee rest of the cast including, Tom Wilkinson, Tim Roth, Common, Carmen Ejogo, Giovanni Ribisi, Oprah Winfrey, Keith Stanfield, Wendell Pierce, Martin Sheen, and Cuba Gooding Jr. all turn in amazing performances. 'Selma' is a powerhouse of a film and stays with you long after you see it. Don't miss this film.",8,10,16,12 August 2015
La La Land," I'm in love with 'La La Land'!
","Ever wish there was a movie that didn't involve zombies, drug cartels, robots, or superheroes facing off in a post-apocalyptic end-of-world scenario? It seems more often than not these days, that those types of films are taking up all of the theaters at your local movie theater. Luckily, every once in a while, we get something different, kind, and magical. This time of year, we are so very fortunate to get one of the absolute BEST films of the year, if not in the past several years with 'La La Land'.Director/Writer Damien Chazelle ('Whiplash' & '10 Cloverfield Lane') has gone back to the music roots and made this ode to the golden age of Hollywood musicals, but set in present day Los Angeles with stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Chazelle really hit home with 'Whiplash', but 'La La Land' is a more light-hearted take of music and love as a musician (Gosling) and actress (Stone) cross paths in Los Angeles, fall in love, and sees if their relationship stands the test of time and fame as both end up making it in their respective fields.This film really highlights the talent of Chazelle, as each dance and music number is perfectly scored, choreographed with excellent attention to detail in every moment. He pays homage to the old days of cinema without hitting you over the head too often and makes you fall in love with these amazing, yet flawed characters. Gosling and Stone deliver outstanding performances and yes, actually sang and danced on their own, in addition to playing their own instruments. The result was simply magical with an excellent jazz score that I can't stop listening to.'La La Land' is such a beautiful film that you will be immediately entranced in its brilliance from the first scene, which is a 'one-take' scene that was shot on location on a 1oo foot bridge ramp in Los Angeles with over 100 dancers taking place in the opening musical number in a simulated typical L.A. traffic moment. The colors and choreography are just incredible and paves the way for the rest of the film. 'La La Land' is a perfect blend of comedy, drama, and music- and one breathtaking visual experience after another. This film will be watched over and over again for many years to come.MUST-SEE!",9,4,13,23 January 2017
Don't Breathe," Horror has a new name with 'Don't Breathe'.
","Fede Alvarez burst onto the scene a few years ago with his short film on YouTube called 'Ataque de Pánico!' It was so well received and well done that a few weeks later, Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Rob Tapert were calling him non-stop and even offered the Uruguayan filmmaker the chance to direct the remake of 'The Evil Dead', which came out 2013 to rave reviews and fan appreciation for what it was. Since then, Fede has a few projects in the works coming up, as he is one of the top new filmmakers to watch in the horror genre.His newest film, 'Don't Breathe' is almost the complete opposite of 'his remake of the 'Evil Dead', in that it is shows almost zero gore and blood and relies on a high amount of suspense and tension throughout the film, which is indeed very successful. I was definitely fidgeting with my fingers and on the edge of my seat the entire time, as the movie goes through dark halls and corners both visually and metaphorically with some sinister twists and turns throughout. The added suspense comes with making the unnamed old man in the film blind, as three young adults plan to rob him, not really knowing who or what he is.Even the multiple locks on the doors and bars on the windows in his run-down Detroit home are not enough clues to these kids that maybe this house is not a good idea. The young adults Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto are on a house robbing spree, in order to make enough money to get out of Detroit. It's a half-baked notion and story, but it gets us into the house owned by a blind man (Stephen Lang) with a past. The problem here is that each character and most of the dialogue just doesn't make any sense and comes across as silly to where you just roll your eyes. It takes you out of the whole suspense here and there during the film.The reasons why these kids rob houses isn't entirely clear and they don't come across as being in anyway redeeming, compared with the crimes they commit. The dialogue is also borderline cringe worthy, and when Stephen Lang finally talks, he sounds a lot like Batman's nemesis Bane, which caused laughter, rather than horror. That all being said, Fede Alvarez is a master of his camera and shooting a movie. From the steadicam one shot that moves multiple levels through the house as the robbers case the place to the slow and intensifying shots in the more suspenseful moments all work very well. The camera purposefully lets you know what props and other devices will come into play later in the film, which already gets your mind going.Alvarez also uses a different version of night vision here when the lights go out in the basement of his home, which is utterly terrifying, and I hope that gets used in future films. Jane Levy is an excellent actress and coming from her starring role in 'Evil Dead', she has more or less to work with here, but she gives it her all and is the one character who actually has some sort of backstory. The other two actors, who again are good, just have no where to go here, thus not connecting or really care what happens to them.And of course there is Stephen Lang, who besides his accent in the film, is one of the scariest characters of recent memory, who takes some dark turns throughout, but also has his own reasoning, which is in away – sympathetic. Oh yeah, and he's blind. The score by Roque Baños has a John Carpenter aspect to it at times and always adds to the high tension throughout. I just wish the story and the bulk of the characters weren't as silly as they came across here. Still, this is a solid and effective effort from Fede Alvarez.WORTH A LOOK!",7,2,6,23 January 2017
Detroit Rock City," 'Detroit Rock City' is one of those films that is always welcome on my television at home.
","Over the years, we have seen a wide variety of coming-of-age stories on film, but nothing quite like 'Detroit Rock City'. While this film has all the aspects of a true coming-of-age film, it also has a ton of very adult situations, which ultimately made this film rated R. We've seen a group of kids find rich stuff, look for a dead body, build a tree house, and even shoot a homemade movie based on 'Rambo'.It wasn't until 'Detroit Rock City' in 1999, where we had a group of four burnout teenagers literally do whatever it took to score KISS tickets, which included stripping, robbing a store, fighting, and even drugging a preacher with magic mushroom pizza. While this movie didn't do to well at the box office, it became a huge cult hit on home video and continues to garner laughs and a spectacular soundtrack some 16 years later.'Detroit Rock City' centers on a teenager named Jeremiah or 'Jam' for short, whose single mother (Lin Shaye) rules over the household with a God fearing iron fist. She makes him tuck his button down shirts into his khaki pants for school and would never allow him to listen to anything more dangerous than The Carpenters. Little does Jam's mother know that he secretly loves rock n' roll, especially KISS, and is in fact a drummer in a KISS cover band with his three friends Hawk (Edward Furlong) , Lex (Giuseppe Andrews) , and Trip (James DeBello).These friends are not necessarily the friends you would bring home for a family night dinner, as they are always stoned, dirty, and destructive. That being said, they are true and loyal friends to the end, which is what this film is all about. Jam has four tickets for him and his friends for the KISS concert that night, but unfortunately his mother finds them and burns them up in front of everyone. This causes all four friends to ditch school and try to score KISS tickets by anyway possible, but due to their lack of intelligence, it proves more difficult that it really should be.Whether it be fighting off disco douchebags, saving a girl from two rapists, winning money in a strip contest, even outrunning a fat Elvis security guard, or having sex for the first time in a sacred place, these four friends will stop at nothing to see KISS and protect their friendship to the end. The movie is completely silly and has some very gross out moments, including two gallons of puke and one hell of a bloody fight in the street. That being said, 'Detroit Rock City' is as genuine as it is funny, and even though these kids might not be the brightest in the bunch, they would be friends I'd like to have.It's so exciting that all four members of KISS signed off on this movie. Not even that, each member had a ton of creative input that went into this production as well as cameos. Speaking of cameos, there are a ton of them here, including Shannon Tweed, Ron Jeremy, Joe Flaherty, Natasha Lyonne, and Melanie Lynskey to name a few. Everyone does a great job in their roles here, and seems to have an amazing time on screen, no matter how over-the-top it can get. 'Detroit Rock City' is one of those films that is always welcome on my television at home, because it's highly entertaining, hilariously funny, and has an excellent soundtrack.",9,0,0,11 August 2015
"McFarland, USA"," I guess you can say this is another Disney Sport's Classic you can add to your shelf.
","When it comes to Disney and their line of sport's films, you can almost always bet on a winner. Each movie, ranging from 'Remember The Titans' to 'Miracle' to the recent 'Million Dollar Arm', have all emoted inspiring characters, a variety of intense emotions, and a high entertainment value. And I'm happy to say that their new film 'McFarland USA' is a welcome addition to this high level of filmmaking.Usually in these Disney films, there are several aspects that can be traced through each film. You have an under-dog type team or athlete that has to overcome something in the sport as well as in their personal lives. You also have a losing team coming up the ranks to quite possibly be the best around. While these aspects of the story ring true as well in 'McFarland USA', the script and director Niki Caro ('Whale Rider') have executed a genuine and charming story that makes everything seem fresh as if you're seeing it for the first time. 'McFarland, USA' is actually a town in central California, where the local high school has won numerous cross- country running championships.This film tells the story of how one coach led his students to victory. Jim White (Kevin Costner) is that coach, and what works so well here is that White has his own demons to deal with. He's been fired from numerous other coaching jobs or his hot temper and is not happy about relocating to the relatively poor community of McFarland, where like his last name, is the only white person in this small, yet lovable agricultural town. He soon realizes that some of the kids on the football team are excellent runners, because they have learned speed and agility from working every day with their parents in the green fields, harvesting food, thus having the idea for a great cross-country running team.To take a different approach again, these students don't take to well to their coach at first, but when the students and their coach alike spend a few days in each other's lives, understanding what each person goes through a day, the team finally forms that tight bond, as they learn from each other. It all has a fairly predictable path (it's based on a true story), but it's still very satisfying to watch, because of the the performances and script. Costner is brilliant here, as he is no stranger to sport's films, but here, he wears his heart on his sleeve and leads this film to greatness.Carlos Pratts plays the star runner who has has an attitude and struggles with his family and the team. Every emotion he conveys is powerful. I wish the beautiful Maria Bello had more to work with here, but she does turn in a solid performance. There are a few moments where Caro tries to hit you over the head with the heavy emotional crescendos, but you can't deny the pleasing way the film is told and all the rewards it delivers through the end. I guess you can say this is another Disney Sport's Classic you can add to your shelf.",8,0,0,12 August 2015
Jersey Boys," 'Jersey Boys' the film is a solid gold hit.
","You might think it's quite odd that Clint Eastwood directed a musical this year with 'Jersey Boys', which is an adaptation of the Broadway stage play that is currently the 13th longest running show in history based on the careers of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, but you'd be wrong. In fact, Eastwood is very big in the music scene and always has been. You remember the film 'Honkytonk Man' and 'Bird', don't you, which were both about musicians. And you can add to this the eight films he wrote and composed the music for. My point is that Eastwood is a solid choice for this great musical adapted into a feature film.But the question is , how well does it transfer to film from the stage? Where 'Jersey Boys' the film might lack in the glitz and glamor that you would find on stage, it makes up for in emotional depth as we jump from each point-of-view from each band-member throughout the 134-minute film, which in my opinion was about twenty minutes too long. 'Jersey Boys' has a 'Goodfellas' - light backdrop that follows a young Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young) getting into trouble with his friends Tommy Devito (Vincent Piazza) and his brother Nick in early 50's New York. They all do odd jobs for the local mob boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken) by day and play in a band by night. It seems that everyone in the neighborhood, including the police know who young Valli is and constantly ask him, 'Don't you need to be home by 11', when he's out late?At home, his parents are good Italian working class people who have a framed picture of the Pope and Frank Sinatra paired together watching over Valli's every move. With Valli's impressive high pitched falsetto voice, people start to take an interest in their band called 'The Four Lovers' as they are going from lounge to bar to bowling alley, performing their tunes, but they don't seem to be cutting record deals yet. Since the Devito brothers can't seem to stay out of jail for short periods of time, the band takes on Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) as the bass player and things pick up. But it's when Joe Pesci, yes that Joe Pesci, introduces Frankie, Nick, and Tommy to Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen), a writer and musician, where the band really takes off. Gaudio previously wrote the hit tune 'Short Shorts' that previous summer, and was known to be a class act. Tommy, the band's self made manager whose temper is fire hot, eventually agrees to bring on Bob, and when they do the hits roll in including 'Sherry', 'Big Girls Don't Cry', 'Walk Like A Man', 'Rag Doll', and 'I Can't Take My Eyes Off You'. All of these were #1 hits and provided the band with big money and concerts, and television appearances.They even changed their name to 'The Four Seasons'. But while the band was doing well, Tommy was secretly spending their hard earned money on gambling and becoming increasingly in debt with the mob. Needless to say, it was a rocky road for 'The Four Seasons', despite all of their money and fame, but all are still alive and well and eventually reunited for their induction in to the music hall of fame in the early 90s. Eastwood did a great job of showing us the more dramatic and emotional moments with each character, followed by a fun and energized scene or two of their big musical accomplishments that actually had people clapping and dancing in sync with the songs throughout the film.And let me also credit Eastwood for hiring Young and Lomenda for these roles, as they were the original Broadway actors for the first run on stage. And they pull it off flawlessly. Young's Valli is pitch perfect and spot on, never missing a beat, while the others fall into place. And Piazza (whose known as Luciano from HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire'), pulls out a great performance as the hot-tempered band-mate, but he gives his character Tommy Devito (Joe Pesci's character name from 'Goodfellas') so much charm and wit, that it's easy to see why Frankie always stood by his side no matter what kind of trouble he got into.However, Eastwood is also known for having a slower-than-desired pacing with his films, and this one is no different. There are a few scenes that could have been cut out that while they offered some emotional depth to some of the characters, they were not given the proper amount of set-up time to make us grieve and didn't go with the basic story he was trying to tell. But other than that, 'Jersey Boys' the film is a solid gold hit. And the end credit scene with the Broadway vibe and dance routine was outstanding. I only hope the younger generation takes to this film and appreciates the music.",7,0,0,15 August 2015
12 Years a Slave," '12 Years A Slave' receives my highest recommendation.
","There have been many films about slavery and the Civil War over the years. Only a couple have been good, and those have featured a big war in the storyline. But as far as a story strictly on slavery goes, the film count doesn't have a lot of marks for great movies. With the exception of Quentin Tarantino's 'Django Unchained', which was more a fantasy and revenge flick on slavery, British director Steve McQueen's '12 Years A Slave' is a phenomenal film from top to bottom, yet it's extremely rough to watch in certain parts due to the emotional content of the story. Chiwetel Ejiofor leads an all-star cast in one of the finest films in recent memory. One we won't soon forget and will discuss with friends, families, strangers, and others for months to come.Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup, a real life free black man who lived with his family in New York in 1841. He lived in a good neighborhood, in a good house, and was well respected in the community, whites and blacks alike. Solomon plays the violin very well and is highly educated. However, one day, a pair of white men take him to dinner and offer him a job for a few weeks for good pay. The guys drug him and Solomon wakes up in chains and is on a boat on his way to the South, particularly Louisiana, where he is sold into slavery for twelve years before his amazing rescue back to his family.Northup actually wrote a book detailing his experiences as a slave and is still selling copies today. Once Solomon arrives in Louisiana, nobody will believe who he says he is and is renamed Platt by a slave trader (Paul Giamatti), who in then takes him and several other slaves to be sold. This scene is particularly rough to watch as we see Giamatti use these humans as products more than people to sell to his buyers. And when he separates children from their mothers, it particularly emotional. Several of the slaves including Northup/Platt are sold to a plantation owner named Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who takes a liking to Northup's violin playing and higher education.Ford actually seems like a good guy, but was put in the wrong time period and the wrong place, as he doesn't seem to enjoy the idea of slavery nor does he beat any of them. That can't be said for one of his underlings, Tibeats (Paul Dano), who is quite the opposite and enjoys punishing and abusing these slaves. He pushes Northup to far one time, which causes Northup to beat up Tibeats. And Ford fearing that Tibeats will retaliate harshly, sells Northup to cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).Until now, Northup seems to be doing the best he can to stay alive and plays the helpless victim very well. But it isn't until Northup arrives on Epps plantation, to where things get even better film wise. Epps is in fact a real person and even read Northup's book. But Epps is truly an evil man, and not a one-note evil, but layers of it. Fassbender, who was the star in McQueens previous films, is indeed amazing once again here, if not on a grander scale. Epps' belief is that he can void any thought from his slaves, no matter what they might be in the form of physical harm. But he also reads scripture to his slaves on Sundays, and has them dance in his house for him. However, his marriage is constantly on the rocks with his wife (Sarah Paulson), who belittles him in front of the slaves on how he is not a real man, and how he drinks to0 much, which he does, and it doesn't bode well for anyone, especially the small slave girl named Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), who is raped repeatedly and beaten by Epps and his wife.Towards the end, Epps hires a contractor to build a small gazebo on the plantation by the name of Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt), who is from Canada, and might just be the only way for Northup to escape from slavery as Bass doesn't believe in this slavery nonsense and will even argue with his employer.There are many scenes of difficult watch moments, which include Northup's near death, lashings that show bone on several slaves, and brutal hangings that befall some poor individuals. The routines of the slaves is captured here and it is truly horrific. Even though this story about this particular man has a happy ending, this was not the case with most others. The outpour of emotion from the final scene as Northup looks upon his now older family and out into the open land will leave you in tears and take your breath away as Ejifor seems to go through all of his emotions with his two eyes. It's amazing.The performances by everyone are at the highest level here with Ejiofor and Fassbender sticking out as the cream of the crop. For Ejiofor showing that he is never giving up and wanting to escape, but never says it, is truly remarkable. And McQueen's direction will surely earn him an Oscar nod for this is the most beautifully shot film on slavery ever made.'12 Years A Slave' receives my highest recommendation.",10,1,3,22 August 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," 'Edge of Tomorrow' is highly entertaining and is an excellent addition to the sci-fi genre. I can't wait to watch it again on repeat.
","I'm very glad that the science-fiction genre is back and doing very well these days. The more sci-fi in theaters, the better. And we have what seems a pretty good lineup this summer of movies that involve everything you could want in a science-fiction film. Here to start off June 2014 is 'Edge of Tomorrow', formally titled 'All You Need Is Kill', which is based on the 2004 novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka of the same name. Director Doug Liman ('Swingers', 'Go', 'The Bourne Identity') took a swing at this $178 million dollar budget film and hit a home-run.Although we may have seen similar things in different sci-fi films before, this film feels fresh and original with its great script, good performances, and amazing special effects. One could say that this is like the movie 'Groundhog Day' but with an apocalyptic alien invasion backdrop thrown in that stars Tom Cruise. And let's face it, if Tom Cruise is in the film, you can rest assure that he will save the day, the planet, the solar system, and the universe. The guy just gets things done.We follow a man named Cage (Cruise), who is a military officer journalist who is in charge of convincing the human race that we need to send as many people to war to take out this vicious alien race that has attached our planet and left major cities in utter ruin and millions dead. These aliens are called Mimics, and they look amazing and evil in all the right ways. Their bodies look metallic and have many tentacle like arms and spears. They can move at lightning speed and are super strong. These aliens look like a futuristic killer octopus hyped up on the best speed that money can buy. They can be killed, but it takes some fairly impressive firepower to do so. Needless to say, the Mimics are winning the battle.After a rough talk with the head general (Brendan Gleeson), Cage finds himself demoted to Private and is about to be shipped off to the literal front line of a full scale attack on the Mimics. Even with a full metal robotic endo-skeleton for armor, Cage only lasts a few seconds in battle when he is dropped off (Normandy Beach style), as he has never seen combat or used a weapon before. However, after he is killed by a different looking Mimic, he awakens the day before when he is demoted to Private and has the same conversations with his new officer Master Sergeant Farell (a hilarious Bill Paxton). Everything happens the same exact way, but when he dies, he loops back to waking up at the military base and demoted.A woman named Rita (Emily Blunt), realizes what Cage is going through and asks him to find her when he wakes up again. Rita is the literal poster child for bucking up, becoming a badass, and killing Mimics, as her face is on every bus and billboard around, telling people to sign up for the military. Once Cage and Rita meet up, they figure out that the only way to win this alien war is to kill the head Mimic called the Omega, which is very similar to Vampire lore. So the film plays out like 'Groundhog Day' with Cage learning and going further into finding the Omega each day, but is always met with death on the beach, thus repeating each day.Watching a movie that loops over and over can get tedious, but Doug Liman and his editors did a flawless job in keeping things fresh and non-redundant. At no point in time did I say to myself, 'Here we go again with this.' Instead, we got different perspectives and comical moments from Paxton and Cruise. It was nice to see Cruise 'not know how to fight', at least for a little while here and was met with some good laughs. There are some small nit-picky things I can go into and pick apart, but they are so minor, I'm not going to bother, although I did think the overall ending was wrapped up too nicely with a pretty bow, which is something that recent Tom Cruise movies have a lot of.The special effects are a mix of practical and CG and look very impressive. This proves that Liman can take on a blockbuster budget action film and succeed. I only hope that it makes its money back, because it deserves too. 'Edge of Tomorrow' is highly entertaining and is an excellent addition to the sci-fi genre. I can't wait to watch it again on repeat.",9,1,3,17 August 2015
Whiplash," 'Whiplash' is the BEST film of 2014.
","Big sacrifices and the desire to be the best in the world with your skill and art form is both questioned and put to the test in writer/director Damien Chazelle's phenomenal jazz-infused film 'Whiplash'. This movie is focused on jazz music, but closes in on what one individual will go through to be the best in the world with the difficult question being, 'Is it worth it?'This is Chazelle's second film, and if his sophomore effort tells you anything, it says that he is destined to be one of the greats. The background of 'Whiplash' is quite impressive. Chazelle entered it in as a short film at Sundance in 2013 where it won the Best Short Jury Prize. A year later, we have a a feature length film, which is bold, refreshing, and flawless. If you've ever been a part of a school band, theatre troop, choir coral, or debate team, I'm sure you've had a teacher whose style was to bully or engineer their student's lives in a negative manner to get their talent the best it can be, as well as to separate the winners from the quitters.It will surely bring up memories, good or bad while watching this film as the Shaffer Conservatory of Music University's (ranked No. 1 in the U.S.) top music professor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) more than just instructs his students to play some of the best jazz compositions around for competition. In fact, Simmons pulls the soul out of Gunnery Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) from Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' to mess and manipulate his students to give him perfect performances.Andrew Nyman (Miles Teller), a 19 year old freshman is a very devoted drummer who is on scholarship at Shaffer in hopes of making a career in music. Instead of posters of naked women or John Belushi on his college dorm room walls, he has posters of Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker, giving you the idea that Nyman is indeed serious and passionate about his studies. You can add to this a very traumatic experience for him that happened a year ago that urged him to spend every waking minute practicing, which leaves him not only inclined, but even enthusiastic to endure whatever Fletcher throws his way, figuratively and literally.Fletcher's jazz ensemble of students are very talented, however are tossed in and out at Fletcher's chaotic demeanor no matter how light the mistake. Fletcher always demands the impossible on every minute detail and is not afraid to use very course language to intimidate his students to get them to play something to his liking. Nyman must sacrifice having a genuine relationship with a new girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) and spending time with his father (Paul Reiser) in order to appease Fletcher. As Fletcher pushes, terrorizes, and pressures Nyman to get a good performance, Nyman's emotions come to the front, crying, punching walls, and even destroying his drum kit to the point where his hands bleed profusely. But again, the central message of this story is what are you willing to sacrifice and go through to be the best at your skill and art form.This is not a puff piece about jazz music or attaining your dream, but rather a raw and intimate look of how truly heartbreaking and tormenting it can be to play music at the most prestigious school in the nation. Chazelle has perfectly orchestrated a flawless flow with a superb payoff as we climb that treacherous ladder to attain that beautiful view. His editing skills are top notch here with cuts set to the sweet jazz soundtrack that should earn this film an Oscar nomination not only for acting, directing, and writing, but also for editing.Miles Teller is is brilliant and raw in this role, and continues to amaze and entertain throughout every performance he gives. And Simmons plays this part very two- faced, in the fact that he can downright scare the innards out of you and make you run the other way, while on the other hand, make you fall in love with his brilliance in a flash. These are two performances that won't be soon forgotten. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard this year, making 'Whiplash' in my Top 3 films this year.",10,2,4,12 August 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," This is the best film of the year and I can't wait to see it again and again.
","This marks the fifth time Scorsese and DiCaprio have worked together, and this time we focus on real life man Jordan Belfort (DiCaprio), who wrote his biography on his time on Wall-Street, and how he conned many people out of millions and millions of dollars through his illegal operation and tactics. We follow a young early 20 something New York kid from a middle class family who hits Wall-Street and immediately falls in love with everything involved in the stock broker business. His boss (Matthew McConaughey, amazing), tells a young Belfort the two keys to be successful in the business over a hilarious high-end lunch in the skies of New York. Those keys to success are copious amounts of drugs and tons of sex.Unfortunately, the Wall Street life comes to a halt for everyone on Black Monday, which was a giant stock market crash in the 80s and the firm that Belfort was at, closed down, leaving him out of a job. But hell bent on making money and devising a life style fit for a Roman God, Belfort opens up a stock broker firm with a good name called Stratton Oakmont in Long Island inside an abandoned car garage, where he enlists some shady friends who seem to only deal drugs and turns them into cold-calling salesmen with suits and ties. Among these men is Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), a person who Belfort met by chance. Donnie is Belfort's right hand man and close friend through these few years.Belfort's goal was to get super wealthy people to purchase penny stocks, meaning these wealthy people would give Jordan and his company thousands and millions of dollars for a company that was either non-existent or was being run out of someone's home, and had no chance of making any money. Meanwhile, Belfort and his employees reaped the benefits. Along with that, they fixed market prices, forged documents, and lied, cheated, and stole from their clients. But that's just the surface of the film.The real meat and potatoes of the movie are watching Belfort and Donnie tailspin out of control and hit rock bottom. From a two million dollar bachelor party for Belfort for his second marriage to Naomi (Margot Robbie, beautiful and great here), to mansions, yachts, a helicopter, and enough drugs to satisfy an entire small country, life is not slow, nor modest here.And what Scorsese does here, is make this entire situation laugh out loud funny, even doing a parody of a drug induced sequence that might be one of the best drug related scenes I've seen in cinema history, where we have DiCaprio take a bunch of long lost Quaaludes to which he narrates that he skips directly 'to the cerebral palsy' phase, and has to crawl out of a country club and drive his Lamborghini home, only to have a near death experience while watching Popeye eat his spinach. It's one of the best scenes in a movie in a long time, and DiCaprio is just magnificent here as he uses his body to fumble around in a drug-fueled state.From all the criminal activity that the real Belfort did, he only got a two year or so sentence in a country club resort prison where he was roommates with Tommy Chong from Cheech n' Chong, and now he is a motivational speaker, and I'm willing to bet his fee to speak will skyrocket after this month ends. Scorsese and DiCaprio show us just how brutal it was for Belfort to make his decisions to take on the FBI and eventually rat out many of his partners in turn for his shortened sentence.Jonah Hill is simply amazing here. With his fake giant teeth and hilarious dialogue, you can't help but like yet hate his character. This is truly Hill's best role to date, as he has a lot of room to go crazy here. Margot Robbie plays Belfort's wife with a certain class and crass,a s we clearly see she is beautiful, but also loves the lifestyle, but is quick to move on if the money runs out. McConaughey is brilliant too, but is only on screen for a few minutes, but for those few minutes, we are in the palm of his hand. And playing Belfort's dad is Rob Reiner, who turns in a hilarious performance as a dad who has an opinion on everything, even though he and DiCaprio look nothing alike.And then there is DiCaprio. I've never seen him let loose the way he does here. Well maybe for a few seconds on screen in one of his earlier movies, but the amount of physical comedy, and the use of his body here is over-the-top, and grand in all the right ways. If DiCaprio doesn't win an Oscar, then something is wrong with the entertainment business. His long monologues on pepping up his team of 1000 employees are riveting, and he delivers each line with a surge of chaos and was always one step ahead of everyone.Scorsese uses some elements from 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' here as far as certain shots go, as well as the whole narration aspect is concerned. Throughout, DiCaprio/Belfort is telling us this story, and we are forever charmed by his presence, even though he is doing something very wrong. After all the violence, drugs, intense sex scenes, and criminal activity, Scorsese wanted us to see the rise and fall of a young man who was an addict to money and drugs, and eventually got off very light, considering his crimes.Basically, Scorsese made another gangster movie, but instead of the mob guys, we have super rich white guys in $3000 dollar suits, working on Wall-Street. And it works perfectly here. This is the best film of the year and I can't wait to see it again and again.",10,3,7,22 August 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," . It's quite a sad story when I'm not all up in arms and joy about a movie that involves Middle Earth.
","We are at the end of this 'Hobbit' trilogy with 'The Battle of the Five Armies'. The last three years seem to have gone by fairly fast. It seems like yesterday when I was writing about Warner Bros. heading back to Middle Earth with the 'Hobbit'. I was super stoked about it, because I was such a huge fan of the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. I think I saw each of those films five times in the theater, owned each version that came out on DVD and Blu-ray, and went back to see them when they were re- released. I just can't get enough of the 'LOTR' films. But shortly after the announcement that we were receiving a 'Hobbit' film, things started going downhill.Now, 'The Hobbit', written by J.R.R Tolkien is only 320 pages long. The 'LOTR' books were well over 1200 pages long combined. You can do the math yourself, but taking a small 320 page book and splitting it into three long movies is very difficult to get right. Well the end result was less than stellar. There was way too much filler, slow pacing, and everything just kind of fizzles out. With 'Lord of the Rings', Jackson and his crew took their time and made three incredible films. I am still to this day thrilled, watching 'Return of the King'. It's emotional drama still makes me tear up and the battles are still incredible, along with it's several endings, which are all necessary and beautiful. You really connected to each of those characters in 'LOTR' and even felt that you went on that long and dangerous journey with them. With these 'Hobbit' films, that is definitely not the case. With the first 'Hobbit' movie, it took literally 45 minutes to get out of a young Bilbo's house and start this journey. And even after that, it took another hour to have even a little bit energy. The second film was a bit better, spent some more time with each character and has some fun adventurous action. And most importantly, it finally told us where the story was headed, which was to see the big evil dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch).Part two literally left us hanging on a cliff with Bilbo watching Smaug head to the lake town to destroy it. So what would seem like one of the big climactic scenes of the book, being Smaug destroying the town and then meeting his own fate, happens before the title 'The Battle of the Five Armies' appears on screen. And that is a big problem with splitting this book into three long movies. Smaug was one of the coolest and greatest characters in 'The Hobbit' and he didn't get a chance to shine, at least in this third film. Where 'Return of the King' had tons of depth, meaning, and intense action scenes, 'Battle of the Five Armies' did not.Instead, this third and final film is basically just one long action film, void of any real character development or payoff. Since Smaug is no longer a living dragon, the dwarfs can claim their throne of treasures once again. But this also entices a big powerful orc army to travel to their kingdom to destroy it and use its riches to conquer and kill Middle Earth. So from one fight to the next, we get a straight up action movie. And while we still have these epic large battles where ten-thousand people fight another ten-thousand people, Jackson made the main characters have more intimate fight sequences, which was nice, but again redundant. No character has a transformation in this film. In the 'LOTR' movies, each character went through a rough transformation.They were not the same people at the beginning of the film as they were at the end. But in these 'Hobbit' films, particularly this final third one, not one person has changed or gone through some difficult transformation. The only character to have a glimpse of change is Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), who is blinded by the cursed gold in his kingdom, therefore he comes across as a dick. But of course, he has a change of heart, throws off his crown, and becomes the good guy again. And that is the extent of the character development in 'The Hobbit'. Jackson does manage to hint his 'LOTR' trilogy, but it is done in a very small way, which comes across very cheesy, as if Jackson was giving us a big wink several times in a row. And now let us discuss Legolas. You know the blonde elf who is a Jedi ninja with his swords and bow and arrow.It seems like the studio and Jackson wanted to film a lot of scenes with him trying to have those big cool moments like he did in the 'LOTR' films. But rather than having one of those big moments per film, Jackson added about a dozen of those moments within the span of a half an hour in this 'Hobbit' movie. It completely took the awe and coolness out of each of those moments. Not too mention they were mostly laughable and the CG wasn't perfect. All that being said, the movie as a whole, looks beautiful and was filmed perfectly. The landscapes and epic battle scene shots look very nice. But the performances are solid other than Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Bilbo (Martin Freeman).It seems like everyone else was tired of making the film by then. It's quite a sad story when I'm not all up in arms and joy about a movie that involves Middle Earth. But the fact remains is that the studio was so greedy that they ended up having a poor film trilogy in order to make more money. And who suffers? We the fans and audience do.",4,3,6,6 May 2015
The Secret Life of Pets," Nothing is so secret about 'The Secret Life of Pets'!
","It seems like there are a wealth of animated talking animal movies these days. With Pixar, Disney, and DreamWorks releasing 'Zootopia', 'The Good Dinosaur', 'Finding Dory' and 'Kung Fu Panda 3' recently, it only seems fair that Universal dipped their hands into the sub-genre as well with 'The Secret Life of Pets'. Universal's animation studio Illumination Entertainment brought us 'Despicable Me' and those darn 'Minions' to the big screen, which has made the entertainment business billions of dollars. It seems logical for the studio to cash in on the talking animal genre now, since everyone else is doing it, however with an already over-crowded market for these films, 'The Secret Life of Pets' may fall short of beating out 'Zootopia' and 'Finding Dory' in both the financial and critical realms. I'm not saying that 'The Secret Life of Pets' is a bad movie or anything. In fact there are some great moments that are funny and charming, but it loses itself in the second half of the film when it becomes an action-caper movie that becomes over-the-top and even drags in its short run time of less than 90 minutes.The film really succeeds when it shows just what are pets do when we humans leave for work in the morning and go out the door. The writers and director ('Despicable Me') sure had some clever and hilarious gags that showed the special nuances of our pets that all of us can relate to, but the story revolves around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier who has a great bond with his owner. All of that changes when his new owner brings home a new giant brown dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). These two dogs are basically the equivalent of Mike and Sully from 'Monster's Inc.' in both shape and personality. The two don't get along due to some jealousy issues, but the pair of dogs find themselves lost in the streets in a beautifully rendered Manhattan without collars, and are now on the run from the dog catchers as well as an underground animal rebellion known as the 'Flushed Pets', led by a psychotic ninja bunny rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart turned up to 11).Max's pet friends try to search for him, including a ritzy and hopeless romantic Pomeranian (Jenny Slate), an obese house cat (Lake Bell), a hyperactive pug (Bobby Moynihan), a relaxed dachshund (Hannibal Buress), a tiny parakeet (Tara Strong), a confused Hawk (Albert Brooks), and a spry, old hound (Dana Carvey). Yes, there are too many characters here, and in fact, there are more in the film, which is one of its downfalls. There are just too many characters to juggle in this short time span and most characters just show up for a small amount of time for a few jokes and laughs, then basically disappear.Again, the first half of the film is quite enjoyable with all of the quirks and actions of each pet getting laughs, however in the second half of the film, pets are driving human cars down the busy streets of New York and all come together in a 'Spider- Man' like scenario climax. Perhaps one of the best scenes in the film is when Max and Duke head to a hot dog factory that plays out like 'Grease' and early 40's musical movies. With most of the characters not getting enough time for care and the over- the-top action sequences once again, 'The Secret Life of Pets' becomes rather exhausting and most unfunny toward the end. Still, the film looks amazing visually with the ever so tall skyline of New York as seen through the eyes of our smaller furry friends and the score by Alexandre Desplat sounds excellent and has the Woody Allen New York vibe to it. The film is still mostly enjoyable and has some great comedic moments, but if it just stuck with a simpler story line, instead of turning into an action film, things would have flowed smoother.WORTH A LOOK!",4,0,0,23 January 2017
Finding Dory," 'Finding Dory' gets lost in the sea.
","Another Pixar sequel is here, and this time it takes place under water with 'Finding Dory', the sequel to the 2003 hit 'Finding Nemo'. Wow, has it really been thirteen years since Pixar made $940 million off that cute orange fish? Well, Pixar is in the sequel making business these days, and with 'Finding Dory', they seem to have made an enjoyable and entertaining sequel that has some funny moments, but misses the mark on the heart and soul of the first film – not to mention the lack of creative story telling devices that the first movie had throughout. I'm sure this sequel will make a huge splash with all audiences, but the kids are more likely to eat this up than the adults.Taking place a year after the first film, Marlin (Albert Brooks), Nemo (Hayden Rolence), and Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) are enjoying life in the reef, where Marlin is still worried about everything, Nemo is loving school, and Dory is still forgetting everything, due to her short term memory loss condition. Somehow, she remembers she has a parents (Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy), and even stranger is that she somehow remembers where they live, which is in California. Soon, she enlists the help of Marlin and Nemo, and the trio are off from Australia to California via a recognizable sea of turtles. This is where I thought the plot would thicken with adventure, but in a split second, the trio is in California, where the bulk of the movie takes place at a dreary Monterey Marine Life Institute, which is more like an aquarium, leaving the vast ocean life on the back burner this time.Things get a bit silly and ridiculous from here on out in the form of Dory trying to enlist the help of other animals to get herself inside the aquarium. Perhaps the best addition to this sequel is in the form of a color/shape shifting octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill), who is perfectly content being inside a tank and not in the vast ocean abyss. He's super funny in a good dry way. Other supporting characters include a near-sighted whale-shark and a Beluga whale who can't use its auditory sense very well. They are also welcome additions, but don't serve much purpose. There are some genuine moments and a decent, if not jumbled message for the kids, as well as some good laughs, but it doesn't pack the creativity nor the current that the first film had.Visually, the film is stunning, and maybe one of the BEST looking Pixar films to date. Every nuance of sea life and underwater scene is intricate with the finest of details and fully immerses you into this world. The voice work is spot on and Ellen DeGeneres shines as Dory, while Ed O'Neill and Albert Brooks pack some good laughs. Even though, a lot of the charm and boldness of the first film is gone here, 'Finding Dory' is still worth seeing. Be sure to stay until after the credits for a great sequence involving some cameos and a trio of hilarious sea lions.WORTH A LOOK!",7,1,7,23 January 2017
Arrival," Prepare for their 'Arrival'.
","Not to be confused with 'The Arrival' with a young Charlie Sheen, although both of these films involve visitors from another planet, the simply titled 'Arrival' takes the alien invasion genre into paths that we've never traveled down before. Directed by Denis Villeneuve (Enemy, Prisoners, Sicario), instead of giant cities falling to the ground and millions of people disintegrating into thin air by a laser beam, 'Arrival' follows the path of two people who want to find a way to communicate with the new aliens that have seemed to land at twelve different locations on planet Earth. Set in present day, multiple giant alien spacecrafts land on Earth, where the governments around the globe put their best and brightest on the job to try and communicate with the new visitors.Stateside we have Louise (Amy Adams) and brilliant mathematician Ian (Jeremy Renner) teaming up with the army led by Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker) to actually go inside the spaceship and try and communicate with the aliens by trying to learn their language and writing. Of course, the ultimate goal of almost everyone on Earth is to find out two questions from the aliens, which are 'Why they are here and What do they want?' Over the course of several months, Ian and Louise communicate with basic language skills with the aliens in order to try and figure out why these twelve spaceships have landed on Earth.Villeneuve always gives an honest look at how we might react to this, by sprinkling the backgrounds with news pundits covering looting and politicians giving their two cents in. The real underlying story is with Louise and the loss of her young daughter to cancer, which we find out in the first scene of the film. Her coping and flashbacks to her daughter play a key role in moving on with life and trying to find an answer as to 'Why'. The film goes down a brilliant rabbit hole as to why the visitors are here on Earth and what their intentions are.There is a mix of senses that Villeneuve and writer Eric Heisserer incorporate throughout 'Arrival' that plays to your pleasures and fears on a very emotional level. You won't see burned buildings or people running and screaming or even the White House being blown to bits here. Instead, you will get an excellent and very original take on the alien invasion that has a ton of heart and soul with some grounded, yet excellent performances by everyone involved. This is one of the top sci-fi films in a long time. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8,1,6,23 January 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," 'Birdman' isn't just a film, it's an experience so magical and raw, that you'll be talking about it for months to come. Run, don't walk to see 'Birdman'.
","It's a very rare occurrence where a film changes the game on almost every aspect of filmmaking. From acting to camera-work, 'Birdman' literally soars above the rest where fierce emotions of erratic actors are put on display in a chaotic yet darkly comedic setting inside the St. James Theatre on West 44th Street in Manhattan. Not only do these actors turn in Oscar-worthy performances of the highest order, but director Alejandro G. Inarritu (Amores Perros) and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have given us an image so fresh and that pushes the bounds, that this is one of the most pleasing films of the year, visually speaking and unlike anything you might have seen before. Lubezki has worked with Alfonso Cauron on 'Children of Men' and the recent film 'Gravity'.Now if you've seen those movies, you will remember that they were famous for having long scenes, greater than ten minutes without a single edit or cut (or at least it was made to look like that). Well keeping that in mind, Inarritu and Lubezki enhance that experience by making the entire film of 'Birdman' look like it is one long continuous shot, following the actors over the course of a few days. This gimmick is rarely used in film, mostly because it is very difficult to do and pull off well. Alfred Hitchcock pulled it off in 1948 with 'Rope' and Josh Becker did it in 1997 with Bruce Campbell in a film called 'Running Time'. But none can hold a candle to what 'Birdman' pulled off with this illusion of one long shot. It makes the movie that much more magical.As I said before, the film takes place all in Broadway Theatre, leading up to opening night. The cast is lead by Michael Keaton, who plays Riggan Thomson, a washed up older actor, known for his big superhero films from twenty years ago, who is in desperate need of staging a comeback to become recognized again and to leave his mark on the world. Riggan went off the Hollywood radar when he turned down 'Birdman 4' all those years ago, and is now wanting the respect from his audience, critics, and peers to spur his ego once again. But Riggan will always know that he will forever be paired with his Birdman character, as he has a poster of Birdman in his dressing room and even the fictional character of Birdman talks to him as his psychotic alter ego from time to time as he walks through the theatre, getting stuff ready for opening night.Riggan isn't making it easy on himself either, as he's chosen to write, direct, and star in this Broadway play, which is based on Raymond Carver's 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'. He has hired another film actor named Lesley (Naomi Watts), who is making her Broadway debut and Laura (Andrea Riseborough), who is the on and off again girlfriend of Riggan. But when a bizarre accident leaves another actor unable to perform the role, Lesley wrangles her boyfriend, also a big named film actor Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), which will certainly sell tickets. Shiner is not the easiest person to work with and in fact makes things very difficult for Riggan and everyone else involved from, starting fights, trying to force re-writes, and even drinking real alcohol on stage rather than water during a preview that results in disastrous effects.If that weren't enough, Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone), who is if fresh out of rehab is reminding her dad how irrelevant he is because of his lack of commitment to social media and interviews, and not to mention his best friend and accountant played by a straight laced Zach Galifianakis who is constantly telling Riggan they have no money and that everything is riding on the success of this play. Inarritu shows us all of the inner workings of a Broadway play, from costume fittings to bursts of rage, fights, smoking cigarettes on the roof, to getting locked out of the bulding in your underwear and having to run through a packed Times Square to meet your cue on stage.We see these aspects of a play, but there is something much more at work here, which is showing us how these great and respected actors are mere shells of a real person, void of any sane human emotion. While they may shine on stage perfectly, in real life, they can't figure simple things out like communicating on a plain level with one another or holding a relationship for longer than a few days. It's quite sad to see as each actor gives such emotional and real performances, that you can't help but sympathize with them.The only thing that stuck out to me that didn't seem to fit in to this realistic setting was when the premiere New York Broadway critic tells Riggan that she will kill his play and give it a very negative review, even though she hasn't seen the play. Her reason is that he is a poser from Hollywood who is trying to deliver garbage into the New York scene. While I'm sure this happened more than fifty years ago, I'm certain it wouldn't happen today. But I get why Inarritu put it in there, which is to add to that ever growing tension on Riggan before opening night.Michael Keaton is beyond excellent here. He gives a performance for the ages here and is highly deserving of the Oscar for Best Actor here, delivering on every chaotic and sweet human emotion on the spectrum. Norton is as always excellent, as is everyone else, particularly Emma Stone who plays a lost young woman searching for meaning and her father who has never been there for her. 'Birdman' isn't just a film, it's an experience so magical and raw, that you'll be talking about it for months to come. Run, don't walk to see 'Birdman'.",10,4,8,12 August 2015
The Conjuring," 'The Conjuring' is definitely the front-runner for the scariest film of the year so far.
","It's been a couple of years since we've had a really great and pure horror film, capable of producing genuine scares. 'The Conjuring' may just re-vitalize the genre this summer. Filmmaker James Wan brought us 'Saw' and 'Insidious', which both changed the horror genre when they were released. With this one, Wan set out to make an homage to the classic horror films of the '60s and '70s that relied on building tension and genuine scares rather than the CG effects and gore that we've come to expect out of most horror flicks these days. The results pack a punch that may scare up some box office dollars this weekend.When directors pay homage to a genre, some get carried away and try to add too many of their favorite moments from other movies. We saw this happen recently with the sci-fi 'Oblivion'. In 'The Conjuring', we get a mixed bag of 'The Amityville Horror', 'Poltergeist' and 'The Exorcist'. While at times we can see direct correlations and rip-offs from each film, Wan does a good job of keeping things fresh and the scares moving fast. Although I don't think you'll be hiding under the sheets for weeks to come, this movie definitely produces some horrifying images.The film is based on real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are most famous for their work with the Lutz family in Amityville, NY, which 'The Amityville Horror' was based on. In this one, they hear about strange occurrences with a family of seven at a rural farmhouse in Rhode Island. Before we jump into the main story, we get a scary-as-hell glimpse of what's to come from a previous case that the Warrens worked on, involving one of the creepiest dolls ever put on film. The image of that doll will leave a lasting impression.The setup is familiar enough as Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) and their five daughters move into their new big home in the middle of nowhere. Soon enough, the family members start to smell horrible odors, hear strange noises and see ghastly things. At first, only one at a time tends to see or hear these strange occurrences, which builds the tension as we progress through the story. They even play a game similar to Hide and Seek, called Hide and Clap, that involves a blindfold and is truly terrifying.Once the hauntings get more severe, Roger and Carolyn enlist the help of the Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) to help rid their house of whatever entity is in there. Ed is reluctant to accept the job at first since a previous case made a disturbing impression on his wife Lorraine, and she hasn't been the same since. Eventually, they accept and head over to the Perrons' house with cameras, holy water, crucifixes and UV lights. It doesn't take long for them to realize that more than one force is in the house, including ghosts and demons. As we journey through the entire house of big rooms, closets and small passageways, we come to a chilling climax that involves an exorcism.One of my biggest complaints is that the film steals too much from other horror movies, even the finest of details, which kind of takes you out of the moment. It doesn't happen too often, but when it does, it's a bit distracting. Another problem is the abundance of daughters that the Perrons have. I know this is supposedly based on a true story, but in this adaptation, five daughters seem too much, as we don't get to spend enough time with each of them and the movie has too much going on. Add to that the side story of the Warrens' own daughter having issues, which doesn't coincide with the main plot too well.That being said, the film's creepy atmosphere and its many scares outweigh the bad parts. Livingston, Wilson and Farmiga turn in great performances. They're never over-the-top and seem very realistic. The one that really shines, though, is Lily Taylor. She gives a brilliant performance full of range and viciousness. With minimal CG effects, 'The Conjuring' is definitely the front-runner for the scariest film of the year so far.",8,1,2,23 August 2015
Straight Outta Compton," 'Straight Outta Compton' is one music bio-epic you can't miss. It's an incredible film that is executed exquisitely, and not only that, it's an important film.
","Music biopics are one of my favorite genres of film. I love seeing a musical artist or band portrayed on screen and their rise to fame, complete with how they came up with their platinum hits, warts and all. As of lately, we haven't seen a ton of these biopics with the exception of the excellent 'Love & Mercy' about Beach Boys member Brian Wilson. Most of the biopics usually focus on one person or a band and go up until they hit it big, but that's not the case with 'Straight Outta Compton', which is more of a bio-epic than a biopic. Instead of following one person, the film follows three main characters with a treasure trove of other superstar artists.The three in question are Andre Young, O'Shea Jackson, and Eric Wright or Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E respectively as they form one of the world's greatest rap groups in the late 80s - 'N.W.A.'. Director F. Gary Gray ('Friday'), has perfectly strewn together several characters and told their stories through several years, highlighting the good times as well as the bad of these three amazing artists. If you grew up like I did in the 80's and 90's, 'N.W.A.' was a huge deal. Not only was their music and lyrics incredible and powerful, but they spoke the truth about was going down in their violent neighborhoods as well as how the racist and trigger happy L.A.P.D. would treat them and their fellow neighbors.Nothing like that had been done before and caused a revolution of sorts as it gave the people a voice to stand up against the unfair and unjust law enforcement, as well as shed light onto what was going on the in these certain neighborhoods on a daily basis. Dre (Corey Hawkins) and Ice Cube (Ice Cube's son O'Shea Jackson Jr.) were already creating beats and rapping about the streets at local rollerskating rinks and other parties in town to get by, and people were taking a keen liking to the new style of rap. It was then that they asked their drug-dealer friend Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) to front the money to cut single, which would become 'Boyz n the Hood', as Dre made the music, Cube wrote the lyrics, and Eazy sang.It didn't all come easily either as we see in a humorous scene where they finally talk Eazy into getting on the microphone, and realize he sounds awful, that is until Dre gives him some advice and direction, to which we hear those iconic lyrics, 'Cruisin' down the street in my 64'. This film is made up of moments like this, and it's so much fun to see how these amazing artists came up with it. After the 'Boyz n the Hood' single was released on Eazy's Ruthless Records, Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a music manager comes after Eazy and tells him her can bring him to the top of the music game. All seems kosher and right with Jerry at first, but he's focused on Eazy rather than anyone else in the group, leaving Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella without pay or claim to their contributions to their first record 'Straight Outta Compton'.As we go through these guy's careers, we also see their vulnerable side, as they struggle with fame, death, law enforcement, and even the federal government who try to cease and censor their music. We even see the origin of their famous song 'F*ck the Police', after several repugnant L.A. police officers force these guys to the ground outside their music studio for doing literally nothing, which is something these musicians have witnessed and been privy to many times before. We also get glimpses of how TuPac, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, and Suge Knight came into play as well, with their usual claims to fame, whether it be how Snoop and Dre created 'Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang', Dre showing 'California Love' to TuPac, or Suge Knight showing his true violent colors.It's all well directed and executed in a manner that you'd always hoped it would, which respects these artists. The film spans quite a few years and gives each person enough time to relate and sympathize with, which is key in this story and Gray shows each sequence, emotional moment, and concert flawlessly. The actors here are perfect as well, and all show some great promise in their future careers. Each performance was spot on and very believable, pulling out each emotion perfectly. You might even muster tears at certain points from these great performances.Not only that, these guys look so much like the real-life people they're portraying that I forgot I was watching different actors several times throughout. Their facial expressions and mannerisms are spot on. And of course, Paul Giamatti plays the asshole business manager/agent very well, just like he's played in several other films in his recent career. Then of course there is the music, which is chock full of the greatest rap hits from this time period. You'll find yourself moving to the beat with each song. It's hypnotic in a way.'Straight Outta Compton' is one music bio-epic you can't miss. It's an incredible film that is executed exquisitely, and not only that, it's an important film, that showcases some of the violence of law enforcement that is going on today. This is a must-see.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION AND MUST SEE!",9,20,60,13 August 2015
The Wolverine," While 'The Wolverine' is still not a solid film, it's a step in the right direction.
","This second installment in a supposed Wolverine trilogy is certainly a step in the right direction. Despite 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' being a terrible mess of a film on all levels, it managed to muster almost $400 million worldwide. With James Mangold at the helm this time, we finally have a decent attempt at furthering one of the most beloved mutant heroes in comic book history.Writers Scott Frank and Mark Bomback take their cues from Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's comic book story arc from the early '80s to give us a modern-day take on the character. Dealing with severe depression about his immortality, Logan takes on the Yakuza and corporate corruption in Japan. While it's not the norm for a comic book film, Mangold pushes things in the right direction, until an anticlimactic fight scene that falls apart on every single level.We first see Logan (Hugh Jackman) a bit of time after the separation of the mutant squad in the horrible 'X-Men: The Last Stand'. Logan has let himself go. He lives in the forest on a pile of rocks, and has a beard that could compete with Grizzly Adams. His only friend is a giant Kodiak bear. Throughout the movie, Logan is haunted by corny dream sequences about his late love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who Logan was forced to kill some time ago. For some reason, Janssen's wardrobe consists only of white lingerie.As we learn in a flashback, Logan saved a young Japanese soldier from a nuclear bomb, and the two have stayed distant friends for many years. When Japanese hipster Yukio (Rila Fukushima) shows up in the present day to inform Logan that his long-time friend, now a powerful business tycoon known as Lord Yashida, is knocking on death's door and wants to say his final goodbye, Logan follows her to Japan, where things get a bit hairy. After Yashida's death, events spiral out of control. Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is a target of the violent Yakuza, seemingly led by Mariko's father (Hiroyuki Sanada). She and Logan go on the run from assassins, ninjas and the mutant villain Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), who dresses in green and kills her victims with a venomous kiss (and is eerily similar to Batman's enemy Poison Ivy). This all leads to a climactic battle where Logan must defeat the Silver Samurai.Other than a fun and silly scene on top of a 300 mph train, most of the action takes place on the ground with very little CGI, if at all. The martial arts fighting is spot-on and fun to watch. Mangold does a good job capturing the Japanese culture and cinema.Hugh Jackman once again owns the Wolverine role. We see him struggle with his personal demons and physical ailments, as well as take on seemingly unstoppable villains with this constraint.The 3D conversion does little to impress, although the wide shots of a snowy Japan add some good depth.While 'The Wolverine' is still not a solid film, it's a step in the right direction. Some of the pacing is a little slow, and some elements of silly comic-book humor feel out of place. An end-credit sequence will blow your mind and might make you jump out of your seat and yell 'YES!'I figure that fans of the story and Wolverine will venture out to see this bloodless PG-13 super-hero movie, but the rest of us might as well just wait for the upcoming 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'.",5,1,3,23 August 2015
Thor: The Dark World," I'm not sure who really is to blame for this sequel's dragging pace and missed opportunities, but with an excellent third act, all is pretty much forgiven.
","And we're back with the first non-Iron-Man sequel in the Marvel universe with 'Thor: The Dark World', with the entire cast back ready for more saving the universe and defeating evil. However, this time around, the sequel felt uneasy and a little bit off, as it dragged in the mid-section quite a bit, or when Tom Hiddleston's Loki (Thor's adopted brother) is not on screen. Sure, the main event is Thor himself (Chris Hemsworth), but he seems to take a back seat for most of the film, as the co-stars really drive this movie as Thor smashes his hammer from foe to foe.This sequel is set to make a killing at the box office, and I'm sure it will opening weekend, but I imagine word of mouth after that will drive sales down. That's not to say that this is a poorly made movie, or even that it's not an enjoyable film. On the contrary, it's a very enjoyable film, it just dragged a bit, and I'm sure that's why Marvel filmed some extra scenes with Loki, which were sorely needed this time around. And director Alan Taylor does his best with the big steaming head of Marvel looking over his shoulder constantly. I'm not sure who really is to blame for this sequel's dragging pace and missed opportunities, but with an excellent third act, all is pretty much forgiven.As we see in the opening scene, which is a very early epilogue, is a battle with creatures known as the Dark Elves, who look very creepy on a planet called Alfheim, who were actually existing before the beginning of time. Their big weapon against everyone and everything is called Aether, which is a black and red gas like substance that can destroy all. However, the Dark Elves are seemingly all killed by Thor's grandfather, but a few manage to escape.Cut to present day, which is literally right after the 'Avengers' film as we see Loki in handcuffs awaiting his sentencing for destroying New York by King dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins). He is sentenced to the rest of his life in the Asgard dungeon with all of the other criminals from the other worlds or realms, which his cell resembles something similar in X-Men or any other futuristic movie, with white walls, and fancy furniture, and a glass like window instead of metal bars, where he has genuine conversations with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) about their relationship and love, and who finally gets a bit more action and character this time around than the first film.Since the Bifrost bridge that connects Earth and Asgard was destroyed in the first film, Thor and his love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), have not seen each other, as Thor and his small army of friends are keeping the peace on other realms. But Thor checks in from time to time with the gate keeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) who can see that she is doing alright, and even on a date with Richard (a under-used Chris O'Dowd). But when her intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) interrupts her date with news of some space anomaly that is similar to the first time Thor appeared, Jane is sucked into a different realm and the Aether enters her body, giving her some powers.As this happens, the remaining Dark Elves are awakened and led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) to retrieve the Aether and destroy the universe. With the cutting between the Dark Elves plotting war and the Asgardians and Earth, all becomes a bit jumbled and messy. As Thor takes Jane to Asgard to seek help and meet the family, it's clear that the Dark Elves mean business and the only one who can seem to help out is Loki, to which against better judgement is freed from prison and asked to help defeat the bad guys.It's only here with Loki, when the film sparks new life, that is until the final battle in Greenwich, London, where buildings are destroyed, and Earth, Asgard, and The Dark Elves square off. With the great character of Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Loki delivering great one-liners, the sequel finally finds its footing, and becomes the movie it needs to be.Director Allen Taylor has directed some of the best episodes of the best television shows of recent memory including 'The Sopranos', 'Mad Men', and 'Game of Thrones'. He seems to do a good job here without the advantage of having several hours worth of plot development, but again, Marvel is known for clashing heads with the creative types. And editors Dan Lebental and Wyatt Smith deserve some mention here, especially in the final 15 minutes of the film, as the battle travels between realms quite often, and the timing with this is flawless. And Brian Tyler's score is excellent, as it always adds some great suspense and emotion into every scene. I definitely need this soundtrack.And be sure, as always, to stay till the very end after credits roll. As there are not one, but TWO extra scenes that might make you scream and laugh.",7,2,3,22 August 2015
Lucy," Worst movie ever.
","I have no idea why such amazing talents as Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman said 'Yes' to Luc Besson's 'Lucy'. Maybe it's because it was shot in Taiwan and France, and the actors got to travel and see the sights, but it definitely couldn't be because of the script or filming. There was a time when I loved Director/Writer/Producer Luc Besson. He gave us 'Leon: The Professional', 'The Fifth Element', and 'La Femme Nikita'. He makes most of his living by writing shoddy action movie screenplays and producing, such as the 'Taken' franchise, 'The Transporter' movies, and many other action films that you don't remember anymore.I would just like to know what happened to this once great filmmaker who gave us such great characters as Leon and Mathilda or Corbin Dallas, Leeloo, Ruby Rhod, and the impressive Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg. Besson's newest film 'Lucy' has a decent set up, but fails to tell us what the characters or film itself is trying to tell us. At one point, it wants to be a superhero movie, then at other times it wants to be a cat and mouse gangster film, then it wants to jump into a Terrence Malick 'Tree of Life' scenario complete with dinosaurs, time travel, and the Old West.For some reason, Besson wanted to keep 'Lucy' right at 89 minutes, but decided to pack enough characters and story to last 2.5 hours. Needless to say, you won't feel anything for any character, no matter what their demise. If you've seen the trailer or even the tag line for the poster, then you already have a sense of what the film is about. Johansson plays an American girl named Lucy, living with a friend in Taiwan, who spends her days going to class and her nights partying with all the wrong people. She meets up with a guy who she dated for one week, who asks her to deliver a briefcase to a guy she doesn't know. This guy turns out to be some sort of drug lord yakuza named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi), who now has Lucy and three other people in his custody.They are all told they will be drug mules for a new type of drug that is guaranteed to make kids go wild, and all four captives are cut open to put the drugs in their lower stomach for transport across the globe. Lucy is beaten by one of Mr. Jang's goons for not putting out and one of the bags of drugs in her body starts to leak out into her blood stream. Due to a chemical in the drug that creates life for pregnant women, Lucy is able to use more than just 10% of her brain, which brings us to the overall story arc of the film. If you can use more than 10% of your brain, or hell, if you can use 100% of your brain, what would you be capable of? That is what Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), tries to answer for us, as his scenes are spliced into some of the action beats as he is giving a lecture to students and colleagues on what a human being is capable of if they start using more than just the average 10% of brain power we are given.Well it seems that Besson thinks that it turns you into Superman, Magneto, Professor Xavier, Mystique, and Wolverine all at once, as Lucy now has telekinetic powers, X-ray vision, the ability to control people and objects, the ability to change her physical appearance in one second, and the ability to heal faster. The theories here are so insane that they are laughable, as in one scene, we see Lucy looking at people in a populated area on their mobile phones, able to see their cell signals shoot in the air. And just like a touch screen computer, she can move her hands and move the signals to find something she is looking for, which is Mr. Jang and his posse who are after Lucy. But after the first action scene with Lucy literally moving her hand from her left to the right, which takes out a dozen armed gang members, we never again feel like she is in any real danger. And it's completely ludicrous that in the final climactic fight scene, that she doesn't help any of the real police officers in the stand off with the yakuza, when all she has to do is move her hand. But hey, she is now time traveling and turning into a computer, literally.Besson thinks that is we use more than 10% of our brain, we become less human, as Lucy turns into basically a 'Terminator' void of any emotion. Man, what a waste of a good set up and talent. Johansson is good with what she's given, but the script doesn't give her much to work with, besides one scene when she is on the phone with her mother, telling her that she can feel everything and that she is going to die. And Freeman is there to play the same role as he always plays, which is the older man with wisdom. 'Lucy' is a superhero movie without any fighting in it, besides some gun-play. It definitely wants to be something more in that Lucy might have the answers now to why we are all here, but instead of investigating that topic, it would rather spend more time on a band of gang members coming after Lucy, only to be immediately killed off with a wave of the hand. Do yourself a favor this weekend, and SKIP this movie.",1,0,4,15 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force is strong with this movie.
","I can't believe it's finally here. Ten years since the last 'Star Wars' movie, which was 'Episode III' by George Lucas. In the decade that followed, we all thought we would never see another 'Star Wars' feature film again, since Lucas himself destroyed and ruined the prequel trilogy and continued to alter the original trilogy to dried up mess of movies that are almost unrecognizable. Fortunately for every 'Star Wars' fan in the world, he sold his production company that included the rights to 'Star Wars' to Disney for a modest amount of $4 billion.Disney needs to make that money back somehow so their first announcement was to make the three 'Star Wars' sequels with 'Episode VII', 'Episode VIII', and 'Episode IX'. Not only did they announce that, but they also said that Lucas would not be a part of the future films, which is when they announced that J.J. Abrams would take over the first movie in the sequel trilogy. It's a crazy, yet smart move, because Abrams directed the 'Star Trek' reboot and now he has 'Star Wars' under his belt, which is one of the biggest film franchises in history and one of the largest and most rabid fanbases ever.Through future announcements and trailers, we realized that Abrams had enlisted the original cast to return in their roles. Yes, that means Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are back as Luke Skywalker, Leia, and Han Solo. It's something we all collectively thought we would never see again, and through these trailers, we cried, we cheered, and we became those kids again, waiting in lines at theaters without mobile phones for hours on end to see our favorite movies. That's all changed as the Force has indeed awakened in a big way. J.J. Abrams has made one hell of a 'Star Wars' film, one that should please all fans who haven't been excited or happy with 'Star Wars' since 'Return of the Jedi' in 1983.Abrams was adamant about using almost CG here, but rather practical effects with big props, real set pieces, and puppets and robotics to make this movie, just like the filmmakers did in the original trilogy, and I'm here to say, it looks fantastic and true to form without any of the unrealistic CG. So where and what is 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' telling us? Taking place some thirty years after 'Return of the Jedi', the film focuses on two new young people named Rey and Finn (Daisy Ridley and John Boyega respectively). Rey is a scavenger while Finn is a stormtrooper who abandons the dark side to help Rey.Since the fall of the second Death Star from 'Return of the Jedi', Luke Skywalker has been in hiding and both The First Order (the new dark side factoin) and the rebellion, led by now General Leia Organa, are looking for him. Luckily, a new, cute droid named BB-8 might have a map to Luke's location. Abrams has taken careful consideration with the new and old characters, using their skills and traits to their fullest without ever being over-the-top or paying homage. It all seems realistic and made from the heart instead of trying to pay homage. Other past characters and of course the famed Millennium Falcon show up quite a bit as well.'The Force Awakens' is action packed with a fast pace from start to finish. There is barely any time to breathe. That being said, Abrams along with original 'Star Wars' writer Lawrence Kasdan have achieved a great mix of drama, character development, and comedy to make this a very successful, entertaining, and quality 'Star Wars' movie. Boyega is fantastic as Finn and Daisy shows she has a ton of range of emotions and physicality for this amazing role. The original cast members all turn in great performances as well.There is also an excellent performance from Oscar Isaac who plays Poe, one of the best X-Wing fighter pilots here and is key to the story. One of the bigger surprises in the form of acting is from Lupita Nyong'o who plays Maz Kanata, a pirate who is virtually unrecognizable from all the makeup. She steals the film in every scene she's in. Then there is of course Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who is the new big bad guy who is just one of the better villains in recent memory.Driver is one of the best actors right now and his struggles and emotion here in the film is fantastic. He's not your typical villain, and it's a breath of fresh air. On top of all this success is John William's new score, which has the nostalgic fanfares along with some new scores. It's simply amazing. 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is the '' movie we always wanted since 1983, but never got, but now that we do, we can all rejoice and become those kids again. The force is strong with this movie.MUST SEE!",9,5,27,17 December 2015
Godzilla," 'Godzilla' is definitely back in a big way,
","And that is what Edwards focused on here with his $160 million dollar version of Godzilla. There are virtually no comedic lines or quips in the two-hour run time of this reboot, which I think this 'Godzilla' remake could have used maybe just a hint of instead of being somber the entire time. I almost wanted Batman's arch nemesis The Joker to show up at some point and say 'Why so serious?'We start out with some vintage footage of nuclear bomb 'tests' and head straight into a similar opening to 'Jurassic Park', where we meet Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), a scientist and his cohort Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) as they land via helicopter on an island in the middle of a major dig to discover the bone remains of something the size of a skyscraper. Meanwhile in Japan, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston), a nuclear physicist and engineer at the Janjira nuclear plant and his wife Sandy (Juliette Binoche), another engineer at the plant discover strange seismic extractions and noises getting stronger and louder every hour. Most people think it's an earthquake, but Joe thinks its something worse that 'will send us back to the stone age.'We cut fifteen years later where Joe and Sandy's kid, Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has a family of his own and is called to retrieve his father from Japan who has become reclusive and some sort of nutcase whose apartment walls are riddled with articles, images, and memos of what he's been working on for the past twenty or more years and still trying to prove what caused the Janjira plant to fall to ashes fifteen years ago. Once Ford and Joe are reunited, Joe's theories become true as we see a M.U.T.O., short for a Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism escape from an underground bunker and fly off in the sky, but not before causing tons of destruction.This M.U.T.O. has long insect like legs, red evil eyes, and one bad attitude. Unfortunately, this giant creature looks part robot and part insect and has no character definition whatsoever other than roaring sometimes. This is when more seismic activity comes up on everybody's computer as Godzilla has awakened and has headed towards this M.U.T.O. This M.U.T.O. has two things on its mind. It needs to feed and lay eggs. It's source of food is nuclear and senses out every nuclear warhead, missile and base that it can to eat. It also finds the male version to itself so it can breed along the way, which leads into a giant 2-on-1 steel cage match between the two M.U.T.O.'s and Godzilla himself in San Francisco.Edwards is an expert with his camera and captures the carnage brilliantly as fighter jets crash into buildings and men in parachutes try to dodge the chaos on the ground, all while three giant monsters are battling it out. It's quite spectacular. However, we don't fully see Godzilla until maybe halfway through the film, which is unfortunate since this is 'Godzilla'. But when he's on camera, does he own every aspect of that screen. He's a little big bigger and a little bit beefier than before, and is a beautiful creature not to be messed with. Even Godzilla's eyes speak in volume to what he is feeling. I only hope that if future films are to come of this franchise, they show more of Godzilla in action.In addition to the very serious tone with this is the inability to connect with any of the characters besides Cranston's Joe who turns in a great performance. I can't say the same for anyone else though. Johnson could have been played by any hot male action star and had no direction or depth at all as he tried to diffuse bombs for the navy and help people along the way during the monster attacks. And Watanabe can only be seen in long distant glares at the chaos that was unfolding and uttering lines like 'Let them fight', which was an homage to the sillier sequels from the past. And Ford's wife who is played by Elizabeth Olsen is good, but is not given much to work with and plays a frantic mother and wife for short spurts.But luckily, Edwards keeps the pace moving despite these things with great and beautiful action sequences in Hawaii and Las Vegas, before the ultimate San Francisco showdown. I just wish it took some of the characters a little while longer to accomplish certain tasks or be in a certain place rather than it happening on the first try every time. It took the realness out of the whole equation as odd as that may seem with this movie.All that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this 'Godzilla' and has no resemblance to the 1998 reboot from director Roland Emmerich that starred Matthew Broderick. In fact, it's okay to completely forget that film was ever made. Evan's 'Godzilla' is a visual masterpiece and one of the finest monster and action films of all time. Nobody can make this amount of destruction look so beautiful and magnificent like Edwards. And even though we don't get tons of time with Godzilla, the time we do is insanely fun and epic, which composer Alexandre Desplat's score adds a lot of suspense and fun to the entire film.We have to see how well this one does first at the box office, which I hope scores big for weeks to come, because 'Godzilla' is definitely back and BADASS!",8,0,3,17 August 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is completely awesome and probably the most fun you'll have with a film this early on in the year.
","I can officially say that the first AWESOME, s movie of 2015 is finally here, which is 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. Based on Mark Millar's comic book, director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Snatch) has once again delivered the goods and high entertainment value with an homage to spy films, particularly the 'James Bond' franchise. So what's that mean? It means the guy who made 'Kick-Ass' and produced 'Snatch', made his own version of 'James Bond', and it's as violent and gory and funny as his other films I mentioned.What works so well with 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', besides the fun acting, incredible fight choreography, stunning camera work, and over-the-top characters, is that it's self-aware of exactly the type of movie it is and wants to be. It even goes so far as to mention the 007 agent a few times and talk about the usual spy genre movie tropes and how this is completely different, which of course it is. I only wish I could go back and watch this for the first time all over again.There isn't anything really new here as far as story goes, but how it's executed and delivered is as fresh as the morning snow. In London, there is a super secret service, made up of highly trained and intelligent people called the 'Kingsman', which on the outside is a storefront for very fashionable clothing, but is rather a spy agency that comes with all the fancy weapons and gadgets. This elite group is headed up by Arthur King (Michael Caine), and we center on one of the agents named Harry (Colin Firth). As this group tours the world, stopping bad guys, it's bound to happen that some super agents will bite the dust, hence a need for new recruits.This is where a young man named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) steps in as a new recruit and has a forgotten relationship with Harry. A good chunk of the film is spent in a dangerous and highly entertaining training camp sequence where Eggsy along with other possible recruits try to attain the role of Kingsman. These training sequences put Navy SEALS boot camp to shame. Meanwhile, a billionaire guy named Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a hilarious lisp) has invented a microchip to make the internet and phone calls free for everyone. In fact, the microchip is free itself and available to the everyone, everywhere. But Valentine has a secret diabolical plan in play with these microchips that just might kill everyone on Earth.So now the Kingsman must step up to the plate and prevent this from happening, and needless to say, things hits the fan in the most gruesome and fun way imaginable. Some of you might think Colin Firth is not the right man for a character who can kick anyone's butt in two seconds or chop a dozen heads off in one swing, but I'm here to tell you that you're completely wrong. Firth is a maniac, period. He owns this role with strong charisma, wit, and elegance. It's like if his older roles from some period romance project he did, finally grew a pair of giant balls and found an underground arsenal of giant guns and was programmed to kill anything and anyone in matter of seconds.That's how Firth plays this role, and I couldn't get enough of him. Taron Egerton does a great job here too as the punk kid with a bad home life with a heart of gold, who changes his tune and becomes the person he was supposed to be. And boy, is he rewarded at the end of the film too for his accomplishments. Unfortunately, there are not any snakes or sharks here for Samuel L. Jackson to be afraid of, but lucky for us, this is a highly energetic and flamboyant role for Jackson, unlike anything we've ever seen him in. His lisp is golden and hilarious, his fear of blood, vomit, and violence causes huge belly laughs, and his love for McDonald's hamburgers and fries hit all the right notes. It's the classic over-the-top James Bond villain here, and Jackson played him perfectly.And if you're a fan of the fight scenes from 'Kick-Ass', meaning the no-cut, one-shot camera movement to capture all the decapitations, blood, kicks, and punches, then you'll greatly enjoy the fight choreography here. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is completely awesome and probably the most fun you'll have with a film this early on in the year.",9,3,9,12 August 2015
The Hangover Part III," If this is the final chapter for the Wolfpack, it's a sad and unfortunate way to go out – not with a bang, but with a whimper and a slap in the face.
","I'm not quite sure why 'The Hangover Part III' was called 'The Hangover Part III'. The first two films in this series actually dealt with four friends who had epic hangovers and crazy exploits and adventures. This third installment doesn't even include a hangover, and oddly leaves a lot of the comedy at the front door to focus instead on violence, murdering animals and action sequences. I'm sure this will score a giant opening weekend box office reward, but bad word of mouth should prevent this third and final act from making any more money past the next couple of days.The first 'Hangover' film was a fun, nutty comedy that garnered gut-busting laughs with its witty dialogue and entertaining characters who got themselves into some off-the-wall situations. Then 'Part II' was released and was virtually the same thing all over again, but in a different setting. Despite the many similarities, the sequel offered some genuine funny moments from time to time. However, this third movie is the bottom of the barrel. Instead of making a raunchy comedy with some action beats, director Todd Phillips decided to make a deplorable action-crime film with occasional bits of comedy, and it almost never works.In the first few minutes, we see a prison riot that leads to the escape of Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong) and two deaths, one of which is an adult giraffe that Alan (Zach Galifianakis) purchased for reasons unknown. In a trailer towed behind Alan's car, the poor giraffe dodges a few highway bridges until one is too low to dodge. The giraffe is decapitated into a bloody mess that causes a giant highway pileup behind him. This third go-round tries too desperately to push the bounds into more depravity. And no, this isn't the only act of killing animals. You can add drugging and neck-breaking a few dogs and smothering a rooster with a pillow, to name a couple of other instances.From Alan's behavior and actions, it's clear that he needs some intense help. His family and the Wolfpack decide to stage an intervention and take Alan to a nice rehab facility in Arizona. To sweeten the deal, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) agree to drive Alan together to the facility. However, the guys don't get more than a couple hundred miles before they're run off the road, kidnapped and tied up by a ruthless mobster named Marshall (John Goodman).Marshall had over $40 million in gold bars stolen from him by Mr. Chow a few years ago, and can't seem to locate Chow's whereabouts. But he knows that Alan has kept in touch with Chow often over the years. Therefore, he kidnaps Doug and forces the other three to locate Chow and his gold. Thus begins our third adventure, which takes the three best friends to jail in Tijuana, a basement in Mexico, and ultimately back to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, where this whole franchise began.One of the few likable scenes in the movie comes when Alan meets the female version of himself (Melissa McCarthy), who runs a pawn shop in Vegas. Their banter, body language and love-at-first-sight is engagingly awkward, yet sweet. It's definitely one of the highlights of the film. The rest of the 100 minute run-time, the entire cast seems to be bored and phoning it in. Cooper is still fun to watch take charge of the situation and is witty enough to receive a pass. Galifianakis takes in a meatier role here, but his usual quirky characteristics come across more rude than funny. Jeong's Chow is much less funny here and more aggressive and murderous. Poor Bartha only receives a few minutes of screen time once again, while Helms' Stu is off-camera a lot and not as animated as he was in the first two movies. Some of the minor characters from the previous two films return for a few minutes, but no instance is fulfilling.If this is the final chapter for the Wolfpack, it's a sad and unfortunate way to go out – not with a bang, but with a whimper and a slap in the face. The filming, dialogue and characters feel one-note and vague throughout. The only good thing to come out of 'The Hangover Part III' is the end credit sequence that showcases a familiar scenario and sets up a possible fourth film. That part was met with giant laughs by the audience I saw it with, at least.",1,1,2,23 August 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," This is a great addition to the Coen Bros. library.
","The Coen Bros. have knocked it out of the park yet again with their latest film 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. Although, I don't think this will have the big box office draw that 'O Brother Where Art Thou?' or 'No Country For Old Men' had, but I expect people to be talking about this film for months to come and singing the impressive soundtrack, which was produced by T Bone Burnett. In the scale of things, this is a very small film set in the New York folk music scene in the early 60s. In true Coen Bros. fashion, the mood is darkly funny, and follows a man, who tries to find himself later in life through his music. I can't recommend this film enough.We first meet Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) inside a seedy bar/cafe, where the spotlight shines on him and his lonely guitar as he sings a song about being put to death, then as he exits the bar after his set, a mysterious old man whose face we cannot see beats Llewyn severely for reasons unknown. Llewyn is a struggling musician, who has the potential to be the next Bob Dylan, but lacks manners and vision as he drifts from couch to couch of his friends if he needs to sleep, while also treating these 'friends' in not such a swell manner.We don't really know why Llewyn acts the way he does, but it seems to stem from his music partner's early death that is still clearly effecting him. The Coen's have crafted a perfectly flawed character that is a true test of the human spirit that we see this man get rejected, beat up, and abused - most likely because he deserved it, but how we still want to follow him into the darkness and back, time and time again.While staying at Jean and Jim's (Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake) place, Llewyn is hit with some rough news by Jean, and is forced to fix it with cash he doesn't have and perform music on stage with her and record a new commercial album with Jim and his friend Al Cody (Adam Driver), who is donning the cowboy look in New York. The recording session is very comical.But then the Coen's flip the film upside down into some form of a bizarre episode of 'The Twilight Zone' with Llewyn going on a roadtrip to a gig with an old entertainer played by Coen favorite John Goodman, who has a personal driver who doesn't say one word, and where Goodman himself constantly berates Llewyn. It's a bumpy road ahead for Llewyn and perhaps on this road, we get a glimpse of the true man Llewyn really is, which makes the title seem perfect.The film is beautifully shot of course as we capture the essence of big city life in New York, but specifically in the seedy underbelly of the folk music scene. It's not a typically bright movie, but neither is the film itself. Isaac does an amazing job as Llewyn as we see him struggle with his own mind and body through this two hours of time. And the soundtrack is killer and have been listening to it since the film came out. This is a great addition to the Coen Bros. library.",9,0,2,22 August 2015
Her," It's truly remarkable.
","Usually, the month of January is reserved for films that tend to fall below the less than average category, and are almost always immediately forgettable and tend to leave a bad taste in your mouth like a caramel onion. However, with Spike Jonze's original and fresh tale on the age old story of finding love in the most unlikely place, 'Her' might be the one of the best films not only to be released in January, but in the last few years. I have no doubt that this beautiful and smart film will win tons of awards as well as make a decent sized dent at the box office by word-of-mouth.'Her' could take place next week if needs to, as we are set in the not so distant future where more and more people are living in luxury high rises, and having all of their information brought to them in the form of a tiny computer no bigger than a credit card with one hell of an operating system. The film follows Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a good man who is recently divorced and can't muster up the energy or courage to ask anyone out since his breakup. But that doesn't stop him from performing well at work or spending time with his friends. He's a jolly guy, but deep down he is very lonely, as he sits in his colorful apartment alone playing a virtual reality video game with a foul-mouthed character.He purchases a new operating system, which is billed as having a great artificial intelligence chip added. Once he installs this into his computer and picks a female voice (Scarlett Johansson, AWESOME), it's as if he is talking to a real live person who is by his side at all times. Not to mention this operation system who now goes by Samantha, knows everything about Theodore and begins to know what he needs, loves, and hates. And in our time of people falling in love with their electronics and people spending their spare time on a computer by themselves, rather than with other humans, it's not so difficult to see how one very alive man can fall for an electronic voice, especially someone who is very lonely.Jonze answers most questions we would have about this not-so-far-off future and the ins and outs of having a serious relationship with a computer. Such examples are, How do they have sex? Another one might be, Is this operating system in love with anyone else, as I'd assume other people have bought this operating system? Can Samantha see and hear Theodore at all times? The way Jonze shows the answers to these questions is brilliant. It's a true love story with a different outcome than you'd expect. 'Her' touches on all the emotions, while Samantha begins to experience the same. And Theodore is his own worst enemy and tries his best to not let his past or his depression get in the way of something great.Phoenix does an incredible job as Theodore, as from the moment we meet him, we instantly like him. His mannerisms, his easy-going attitude, wit, and charm go a long way here, and we can't help but root for the guy. I'd want him as a friend. And Johansson is flawless here, but we never see her, but only hear her voice. Now, I wouldn't be surprised if Johansson got an acting award for her voice work here, as it is the best I've ever seen and heard. Her delivery will make you think she is actually there in the room, experiencing every feeling. It's truly remarkable.'Her' is no doubt going to be in the TOP 5 films of 2014 for me, although this is slated for the 2013 Oscar race. Run, don't walk to see 'Her'.",9,0,1,22 August 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the ultimate summer movie, and I don't see that changing any time soon.
","It's a damn shame that every action movie can't be as good as 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. So many action films will try, but will ultimately fail for a variety of reasons. Pure action filmmaking and movies just don't get better than this movie. 'Fury Road' is a troubled story to say the least. Original creator George Miller who made the original three 'Mad Max' films had the idea for this fourth installment back in 1998. That's 17-years ago. This project wasn't necessarily put on a hold shelf, but a few things had happened to delay the film from being made. From 9-11 to foreign policy, to Mel Gibson's infamous arrest, there were a variety of things that prevented this movie from seeing the light of day.Years went by and George Miller went on to make 'Happy Feet', which is a far world away from the likes of these 'Mad Max' films. However, the script showed up again and some rewrites happened, and Miller got all excited again, hence this new film. At first, Miller wanted Gibson back in the iconic role, but both he and Miller decided to revamp the series and go with a different cast and angle. That pretty much brings us to 'Fury Road', starring Tom Hardy as Mad Max. Make no mistake about it, this film is epic in every way and I don't say that lightly.It's a rare occasion where I get overly excited for a movie and have the highest form of expectations, when after viewing said film, it meets and exceeds all these expectations. That's the case with 'Fury Road'. Not only did George Miller build on this post-apocalyptic universe, he also made one of the best action films I've literally ever seen, with mostly using practical effects and not CG. There is really zero down time in this film. From start to finish, something big is happening on screen, which doesn't allow you necessarily to get one breath in, let alone blink your eyes.What I like about this film, is while it's a remake, it doesn't need to spend any time with a backstory for Mad Max. Miller knew that almost all of us would know the general gist of the story going into it, hence we are thrown in straight to the action from scene one. Max (Tom Hardy) escapes the grasp of an evil monster of a leader named King Immortan Joe, who enslaves the poor people below him and keeps all the precious and rare water for himself. Max crosses paths with Furiosa (a badass Charlize Theron), who is taking five women who were impregnated by King Joe to a better place to live.King Joe doesn't like this one bit, so he takes his insane minions, and all of their weaponized vehicles, along with a few other war lord gangs, and chases after Max and these women. These car chase sequences and fight scenes are legendary. Each and every one of the 150 stunt men and women earn their pay check the more with the chaotic stunts that are shown here. Plus, Max more or less takes a back seat here, where Furiosa and the other women show that they can handle themselves in any situation, however, Mad Max for sure earns that name here.This is the purest form of action, which each character and story told through very little dialogue, but somehow through the intense battle sequences and their facial expressions, you bond with them. Nicholas Hoult plays one of the minions named Nux, and he's unreal in this role. I can't believe the little kid from 'About a Boy' turned into this amazing character. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' really has it all in the form of action, explosions, gun battles, chainsaws, and vehicle chases.There is so much happening on screen, that you'll have to go back for a second time to catch it all. I just wish that other filmmakers who were making an action movie would take notes here and follow suit, because this is exactly how to make a movie. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the ultimate summer movie, and I don't see that changing any time soon.",10,1,13,27 July 2015
Goodfellas," I'll never get tired of seeing this movie.
","By the time 1990 came around, Martin Scorsese had already made several masterpieces in film, which continue to be praised and talked about to this day. With the likes of 'Raging Bull', 'Taxi Driver', and 'The Last Waltz', we all knew that Scorsese was one of the finest filmmakers and storytellers around. Even with just those three previous films mentioned, you'd know you were in for a treat when Scorsese wanted to show you something. Then 1990 came around and Scorsese once again changed the film community with a movie called 'Goodfellas', which was his big foray into the whole mafia genre.Like myself, I think that most everyone around would say that 'Goodfellas' is one of the best mafia movie that has ever been put on film. Besides 'The Godfather I and II', I'm willing to bet that 'Goodfellas' can stand side by side with those two films, because it is just that good. However, Scorsese told this mafia drama in such a different way, that it got most filmmakers to start telling their stories on film the same way that Scorsese did with 'Goodfellas'. It's one of those movies that while it may be over 3 hours long, it is completely re-watchable at any time or day, because the characters, dialogue, and story are so compelling and told in such a fantastic and realistic fashion, that you can't help but watch the whole thing all over again, and become entranced by what's transpiring on screen.In 1986, a writer by the name of Nicholas Pileggi wrote a non-fiction book about a real life mafia guy named Henry Hill. This book called 'Wiseguy' detailed the life of Henry Hill from his childhood through his adulthood, as he joined the Lucchese crime family at an early age. The book talked about all the acts of violence and criminal activity that went on, including the largest heist in American history at the time, which was the Lufthansa heist. Luckily, Scorsese got a hold of the book and decided to make a film with a young Ray Liotta playing Henry Hill, who narrated what went on throughout the film.Scorsese also got two 'Raging Bull' actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci to star in this film, which earned Pesci a numerous amount of awards. Scorsese did something that original with this mafia genre, which was tell this story from a sentimental side from the eyes of these bad guys. Yes, we know that these iconic character are violent criminals who murder, steal, and exploit, but we also got to see the family and vulnerable side to them as well, which is one of the reasons 'Goodfellas' is such an achievement in filmmaking. We virtually get to meet almost everyone in the Lucchese crime family and not only see them commit these heinous acts of crime, but we get to see them being friends with one another, taking care of their families, and sticking up for each other.As many as there are kills and blood in 'Goodfellas', there is as much laughs and jokes, which makes this realistic. The real life Henry Hill really laid everything out on the table for Scorsese and Pileggi to get acquire the total realness of the story and picture. Each character is based on someone in real life, which is kind of difficult to imagine. Even some of the more iconic dialogue scenes were taken from real instances, such as the 'Am I funny to you' scene with Liotta and Pesci. It's a funny scene, but damn is it scary for a moment when you have no idea what Pesci's character Tommy is capable of. That's why this film is so amazing. You get sucked in to feeling for these guys and want to be their friends, because they are all charming and fun, but we are quickly given a wake up call to see just how rotten these 'Goodfellas' are.Still, after 25 years, 'Goodfellas' continues to be one of the best films ever made and paved the way for Scorsese into the mafia genre, as well as this brilliant style of filmmaking. We saw it in 'Casino', 'The Departed', and the recent 'Wolf of Wall Street' film, and never disappoints. But 'Goodfellas' is where it all started and continues to be the foundation for most modern mafia films. I'll never get tired of seeing this movie.",10,0,1,6 May 2015
The Great Gatsby," 'The Great Gatsby' is worth seeing and might just be the best adaptation yet of the iconic novel.
","This is far from the first time someone has tried to adapt 'The Great Gatsby' to screen. Previous attempts include a 1926 silent film, a 1949 version directed by Elliot Nugent ('My Favorite Brunette'), the 1974 film with Robert Redford, and a 2000 television movie that starred Paul Rudd. I've seen the latter two, and while I enjoyed some of the performances, both came up weak in the end. Now we have Luhrmann, who seems to have blended Fitzgerald's novel with his own 'Moulin Rouge!' and given it a good wash. While its grand 3D visuals, techno-inspired epic parties, and a soundtrack by Jay-Z, Jack White and Beyoncé might strike a bitter chord with fans of the novel, rest assured that Luhrmann stays fairly faithful to the book.'Gatsby' starts off in grainy black and white, as some dull music rolls out during the opening credits, which morph into highly colorful 3D as if the theatre curtains were drawn up to show us that green light from the end of Daisy's pier. We cut to Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a therapist's office, trying to explain what went down in the summer of 1922 when he lived in West Egg, New York. As he begins, we get a montage of New York being built and the city's successes and declines. The archival footage mixed with the CG footage looks great with an impressive view of 1922 New York City. The only other film I've seen that has matched this detailed recreation of the old Big Apple was Peter Jackson's 'King Kong'.We learn that Nick was a young graduate of Yale and wanted to try his hand on Wall Street. He moved into a small house smashed between two large riverfront mansions. Across the river are his old Yale buddy Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and his wife Daisy (Carey Mulligan). One of Nick's wealthy neighbors is the reclusive and impressive Jay Gatsby, who throws excessive and expensive parties almost every night, where politicians, gangsters, celebrities and socialites show up. However, none of them actually knows Gatsby or has even seen him before.Not until 35 minutes into the film do we even get our first glimpse of Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), with a brilliant entrance and introduction. He simply owns the world with his smile and confidence. On the other side of the lake, Daisy still longs for her long-lost love (Gatsby, of course), whom she had last seen five years earlier, before he left for the war. While he was away, she married Tom, who's a pompous bully, to put it lightly.DiCaprio really puts his heart on his sleeve and bares his soul to be embraced or rejected by Daisy. DiCaprio's performance, as he awkwardly tries to talk with and move around the love he hasn't seen for many years, should win him an Oscar. It's endearing to watch this coming from a person like Gatsby.Meanwhile, during the affair between Gatsby and Daisy, Tom has an affair of his own with Myrtle (Isla Fisher), the local wife of a man who runs a down-and-out garage on the outskirts of town. Their friend Jordan (Elizabeth Debiki), a golf pro and socialite, tries to keep Daisy happy and Tom unaware of what's transpiring until everyone ends up at the Plaza Hotel, spilling their guts about their feelings. This leads to car wreck, and then to Gatsby's pool, which might be the best shot scene in the movie.Luhrmann really slows things down after an hour into the film so that we can see Gatsby's love for Daisy grow as he tries to recreate the passion from when they first met, even though Nick tells him that he can't repeat the past. It's here where we lose Nick in the story. He only serves to narrate from time to time and becomes a bit tedious as the other characters are far more interesting.Maguire does a great job as Nick as far as that can go, being that he's more of a fly- on-the-wall and sides with Gatsby throughout, even though he might not have in the book. Edgerton plays a mean Tom to a tee. You hate the guy, but that's a good thing and he gives an amazing performance. Fisher and Debiki are solid as well whenever they're on-screen. Mulligan is charged with the difficult task of Daisy. Daisy is different for everyone. She is the American dream girl, which could be bad or good for some people. Mulligan does an okay job here, but I felt like I wanted more from her. She seems to tone down her role a bit, which leaves her relationship with Gatsby something less than desired. Truly shining above the rest is DiCaprio. He is Jay Gatsby. His persona, charm and character are flawless. He's truly larger than life here, and one of the best parts of the film. Every time he's off-screen, you want him back on-screen.The picture itself is incredible with its detailed sets, lavish parties and amazing costumes. The film is also in 3D, which I found less than thrilling. Sure, it has some added depth, but it's mostly unnecessary and took me out of the story. I think the story could do just fine without the added effect.With Luhrmann's beautiful direction and Jay-Z's music contribution (which is a breath of fresh air and I think coincides with Fitzgerald's love of modern music), 'The Great Gatsby' is worth seeing and might just be the best adaptation yet of the iconic novel. I can't wait to get my hands on this soundtrack and watch the movie on Blu- ray in glorious high definition.",8,2,5,23 August 2015
Warm Bodies," 'Warm Bodies' is a great addition to the zombie genre and stands out from the rest fresh love story and great and likable characters.
","Jonathan Levine's adaptation of Isaac Marion's 'Warm Bodies' focuses more on an undead romance than any political or social issues, with having just enough blood and guts for genre fans. I have to say that this zombie flick ranks right up there with some of the best living dead films ever made. It's original, fresh, and has an amazing soundtrack. I have no doubt that this lovable zombie movie will make tons of money at the box office.Director Jonathan Levine has taken up the horror genre from his recent efforts in 'The Wackness' and '50/50' to give us a coming of age story set in a dystopian world conceived by writer Isaac Marion, whose book of the same name was published only a couple of year ago. I have not read the book yet, but if it's anything like the film, I'm sure I'll love it. This love story starts out in the very near future where we see a post-apocalyptic world where most people are no the undead, who spend their time wandering around looking for still-live humans to feed on their brains, guts, and organs.Among the millions and millions of zombies is R (Nicholas Hoult). He goes by R, because he can't remember his name as we hear him narrate throughout the entire film. R also cannot remember anything about his former life before the big zombie apocalypse, other than that it happened and what might have caused it. During an afternoon, R and several other zombies are out looking for humans when they stumble upon a group of survivors salvaging a pharmacy for medicine. Durring the attack R is captivated by Julie (Teresa Palmer), who is very much alive and who is killing the zombie attackers. In an effort to dodge her bullets, R attacks Perry (Dave Franco), Julie's boyfriend and brutally kills and eats him.However, it's love at first sight with R, and decides to spare Julie being eaten by himself or any of the other zombies, and escorts her to safety to his home, an airplane at an airport that he has converted into a makeshift home complete with a collection of records and a record player that he operates. At first, Julie is very scared as R only blankly stares at her and groans. But after a little while, she seems to notice he is different and that he is trying to communicate with her, even learning to slowly speak again.It's here where we find out why zombies eat people, especially their brains, as it not only gives the undead their daily fill of vitamins, but also gives them access to their victim's memories, thus making the deadites feel a bit more alive and human. However, Julie knows she can't stay in the airplane with R forever, as she must get back home, which is a section of the city that has been blocked off by giant 100 foot cement walls and is led by her widowed dad, Grigio (John Malkovich), who at one time might have been a decent guy, but is now in charge of the safety of a lot of people and in charge of the make-shift military, and who rarely has time for his daughter.As Julie starts to make her way back home, R realizes that he is transforming into a human again and that there maybe a cure. So , R must tell Julie so that her dad and his army will stop killing the zombies. However, there is a larger threat that equally effects the humans and zombies. They are called boneys, which are a sort of mutation when humans turn to zombies and are undead for a long period of time. These boneys are mostly skeleton-like and have no brain function what so ever, other than eating anything they can find. It's up to R and Julie to let the rest of the world know their secret.The story plays out perfectly with no lags in the script or characters. Everything is on pace and brilliantly told. Their is also quite a bit of comedy here, not only from the situations of teenage love and how awkward that can be, but by one of R's zombie friends, who is hilariously played by Rob Corddry. Also, 'Warm Bodies' is completely aware of itself and how silly at times it can be, which makes this undead comedy shine above the rest.Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job as R as he flawlessly showcases his zombie-like body language and his undying wish to be alive again. Hoult rose to fame as the main kid from 'About A Boy' starring Hugh Grant. Hoult does not have the English accent here and he sounds great when actually is verbal. He's very charismatic as Malkovich and Palmer also turn in solid performances. There isn't ons of gore in this, as it tends to stray away from the blood and guts aspect and focus on the relationship between Julie and R, but there are bits of brains and its of blood here and there to please any gore fan out there.With a killer soundtrack composed of artists ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Roy Orbison to Bob Dylan to Guns N Roses, the older crowd will laugh and love the music used here, even with its cheesy placements, but like I said, the film is fully aware of itself, so you'll be pleasantly happy with it. 'Warm Bodies' is a great addition to the zombie genre and stands out from the rest fresh love story and great and likable characters. I have no doubt that once you leave the theater after watching this, you'll be dying to see it again.",7,1,1,2 September 2015
Sully," I'd ride with 'Sully' anytime.
","We all remember what took place in New York on January 15th, 2009. Pilots Captain Chelsey 'Sully' Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles took an Airbus A320 with 155 passengers aboard out of LaGuardia Airport to their destination. However, a couple of minutes after takeoff, a freak accident with a flock of birds took out both engines of the airplane, leaving the Airbus without any power and no airport immediately in range to land. Making a calculated decision to save everyone's life, Sully was forced to land the plane in the very cold waters of the Hudson River.Nobody was seriously hurt or injured and everyone survived and escaped the sinking plane with Sully and Skiles being the last off the plane, making sure everyone was safely rescued. Sully became a national and world hero for his calm and collected demeanor and quick thinking to save everyone's life. That actually happened almost eight years ago. A character in the film says, 'It's been a while since New York had news this good, especially with airplane in it', which is the overall feel of the film. Directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and a river of cameos, this docu-drama is a feel good film about a man who emulates the golden age of Hollywood heroes in film, but in real life in this case. Captain Sully is 'just doing his job', and doesn't see himself as a hero.He is good at his job, is a good family man, and always does the right thing, which is something we used to see in the old Hollywood films. He is always calm, collected, and polite, no matter the issue or obstacle, which is one of the main reasons this true story turned out the way it did. And that is how Eastwood tells this story. 'Sully' has a lot of similarities tot he Denzel Washington film 'Flight', in that both films have a forced airplane landing shortly after takeoff where there are a ton of survivors. Both films have investigations into the pilots on their decisions, but 'Sully' is basically the complete opposite of 'Flight' in that Denzel's character was dealing with some strong personal issues after the first ten minutes of the film where we see the forced landing.In 'Sully', Captain Sullenberger (Hanks) is basically the perfect man and we don't have to see him deal with his demons, other than his long jogs at night around Mnahattan, as the press hounds him and his family at home about being a hero, as well as if his decisions were the right ones. This is Eastwood's shortest film, running in at 96 minutes. The story is straight and to the point and doesn't lollygag with any side tangents. Eastwood shows us the forced water landing in the Hudson twice from different perspectives throughout the film, which gives the movie a great pace, instead of showing the whole thing in the first few minutes, followed by 85 minutes of an investigation.The forced landing sequences itself are shot very well with every detail getting on screen. The suspense and tension are at an all-time high, even though you know everything and everyone turn out okay. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are both excellent in their roles and every cameo does a great job too. Eastwood shows again that he is a master at his craft and is showing no sign of slowing down with 'Sully'. Stay tuned for the credits for a recent reunion with the real Sullenberger and survivors that might call on some tears.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",7,0,1,23 January 2017
The Martian," 'The Martian' might be one of Ridley Scott's best films.
","It's no doubt in my mind that director Ridley Scott was the perfect person to direct 'The Martian', which was based off of Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name. His brilliant story telling and eye to make a desolate planet like Mars look beautiful is simply majestic. Scott is mostly known for directing 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner', which kind of makes him one of the Godfather's of science-fiction, but he has a few other gems on his resume too, all in different genres. With a movie like 'The Martian' that is in the sci-fi realm, I was pleasantly surprised and overjoyed to find the film quite funny with a very feel-good quality to it, which is something that is not really present in Scott's sci-fi movies.So I'm glad to see that the humor from the book transferred to film very well. 'The Martian' centers on a group of scientists and astronauts who have been doing research on Mars for a number of months including a cast of Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Askel Hennie, and Matt Damon. A few minutes before a giant storm is set to hit the crew, they decide to pack up and leave Mars early, in fear that the storm could tear apart their ship and housing. As they are walking toward the ship, a satellite flies off one of the structures and hits Damon's character Mark Watney, sending him flying a few hundred feet back.Due to the darkness and debris that is flying around, the crew cannot find Watney easily and if they don't get on their ship and take off, they could all be stranded there. It didn't help that Watney's vital signals went to zero. Thinking Watney is dead, the crew heads home, but to everyone's shock and awe, Watney survived and is actually quite healthy. The problem is, he has no way to contact Earth or get home. Not only that, he only has a finite amount of food left, so being a Botanist, Watney tries to grow food, phone home, and get off Mars.Luckily, the folks at NASA back home have a plan and so does Watney, but can he survive the number of days it will take to be rescued? Don't get me wrong, 'The Martian' is as intense and suspenseful as it is funny, which writer Drew Goddard, perfectly mixes these two aspects into one excellent screenplay, and it's here that we really connect with each character, no matter how small or big their roles are. We mostly communicate with Mark through a series of hand-held security cams, as he talks to us on what he's thinking and planning.Instead of slowly going insane, we see him logically solve each problem in order to get home with a bit of wit and humor, which was a nice breath from the usual gloomy and dreadful scenarios we've seen play out in films like this before. The visuals are stunning in this dry landscape and was filmed in Jordan as well as on sound stages in Hungary, where almost everything looked to be real and done practically. It certainly pays off in the final version. Even though the film is roughly over 140 minutes long, it seems to only last an hour, and you don't want to leave Watney's side for a minute. That's how likable he is and to Matt Damon's credit, he just nails the role.Jeff Daniels, Donald Glover, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Sean Bean also show up throughout the film, and in one case Sean Bean has to explain to a group of scientists a moment in the 'Lord of the Rings' film, which is probably one of the better things I've seen in a while. I'm happy to say that the 77 year old Ridley Scott has not lost his way at all. 'The Martian' might be one of his best films, one that well made and acted on every level.MUST-SEE!",9,3,60,2 October 2015
Furious 7," Let it be said now, 'Furious 7' is the first big action film of the early summer.
","It's difficult to talk about 'Fast and Furious 7' or how it's billed 'Furious 7', without mentioning the tragic accident that cost actor Paul Walker his life back in November. This accident was not part of filming, but did drastically change the story line and halted production for quite a while. Walker had not finished filming his scenes, but you wouldn't know it, as the filmmakers used a combination of amazing CGI and stunt doubles to add him through the entire film. It's seamless and flawless in that aspect, and yes, there is a very moving tribute to him at the end of the film, which might cause you to choke back a few tears. I know I had too.It has been 14 years since the first 'The Fast and Furious' film graced our screens, and who would have thought that it would be the powerhouse franchise it is today. The first film back in 2001 cost $38 million dollars, which is pretty cheap for a big action film. Cut to today with 'Furious 7', the budget has gone up to $250 million and has added a string of A-List actors to this high octane world, including Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, and The Rock. Whether or not you've seen any of the 'Fast and Furious' films, you're going to have a great time with 'Furious 7′. Do these films have smart dialogue or lengthy story plots? No, but that's not the reason for seeing these movies. Instead, you get a treasure trove of fast cars, big explosions, fantastic actions sequences, and fun performances by each actor. 'Furious 7′ picks up right where part 6 left off, where an over-the-top villain who seems to be able to take on armies of people with his barehands by the name of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), is after the 'Fast and Furious' team for putting his brother in a vegetable state in a previous film.He has promised to kill each and every member of the team. Meanwhile, there is a security surveillance program called the 'God's Eye', which can tap into any satellite or camera and find anyone with in a matter of seconds that an underground branch of the FBI wants. This branch is run by Kurt Russell, who tells Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) to rescue the hacker who created the program (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a group of terrorists, which in turn they can find Shaw before he can kill them.I know, I'm exhausted after explaining that too. 'Furious 7′ spans a few different countries and an avalanche of multi-million dollar cars that would make James Bond excited in more than one way. Director James Wan ('Saw') has perfectly concocted one of the ultimate action films that uses fast cars, big guns, excellent fight choreography, and giant explosions to keep the 132 minute film keep its super fast pace. There are a few melodramatic moments from time to time, but it's done in a good way, so that we can grow closer to the characters. If you can get through the stinky cheese one-liners throughout, which make you laugh more than anything, you're going to have an excellent time here.On a side note, I'm so glad they added Thai film star Tony Jaa to this film. I've been waiting for him to show up in the US for so long, and I hope he is here to stay, because his fight choreography and talent is some of the best out there. Don't believe me? Check this clip out. 'Furious 7' keeps its laughs, charms and cameos flowing, and even though Paul Walker is gone, there is no sign of stopping this franchise, which is a good thing. Let it be said now, 'Furious 7' is the first big action film of the early summer. Go see it.",8,73,86,6 May 2015
