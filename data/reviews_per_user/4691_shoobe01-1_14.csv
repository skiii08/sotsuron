Deja Vu," If only Ridley had made it instead
","There are plenty of SF movies as implausible as this that I can get around and love, that's not the problem. Nor is the cast, the acting, most of the script, the set decoration and art direction, the very good use of locations, much of the photography, even the sound design and VFX.What sucks is the direction. The editing that chops half the scenes into mayhem. The added mayhem in general. Too many car crashes when a near miss would do. Cars flying through the air when a simply collision would do. Oh my god the rescue scene, with helicopters so low they are about to run into boats, and boats speed through the water apparently to chop up survivors. Don't even get me started on the explosion. So filmy fire laden, unlike anything real and not at all like the very, very, very specific description and diagrams of the explosion shown on screen! Music is also overbearing all the time, ruining most scenes with any emotional content by yelling at the audience THIS IS TOUCHING! THIS SCENE IS ALL FORESHADOWING! Really disappointing, as the story is quite interesting and maybe was even filmed enough someone could edit it into a good movie. But this is a total hack job. Urgh.",5,0,1,18 March 2017
Public Enemies," I was promised a Michael Mann crime epic, what's this?
","Rarely have I been so disappointed in a film. I mean, it was FINE, but this is what counts as a Michael Mann crime saga now? How did this get so amazingly generic in every way?There are not even an unusually large number of awesome scenes that make you see what could have been. It's rushed, over-packed, and therefore unfocused.For no good reason. It picks up rather out of the blue, so could have just done that halfway through what they filmed, then drop the entire mobster subplot, and let the rest breathe. MAYBE that would have saved it. Maybe.",6,1,2,2 June 2020
The Book Thief," Maudlin, bloodless tale of life next door to the Nazis.
","Well acted, immersive environment so great production design, but not up to the standards of the best of 80s TV movies, especially on the holocaust. Maudlin all over, in a painfully cloying way too often. Narrator totally blew it for me. The kids don't grow up. Which makes it hard to to follow that this goes on for like a 5 year period, plus they act like their starting age (12?) even 5 years later when they should not be.And also, bloodless. for 90% of this film this would be great. It's village life to the
jedermann, they see politics, what the war means to them, etc. remotely. But none of the bad seeping through sticks really. Dad thinks he may have run afoul of the rules, and they will come get him, but... we don't feel the peril as none is really shown.Flat. Boring.",6,0,0,2 January 2019
Oblivion," High concept paranoia / soft SF, wrapped in a candy shell of hard SF action
","Not sure why so much hate for this. It's a somewhat typical (spoilers!) Nothing Is What It Seems To Be plot, with at least two of these big reveals of things that are surprising.It is also Yet Another Post Apocalyptic movie.But, it all works. It's a perfectly good paranoia / soft SF concept thing, wrapped in a candy shell of hard SF devices and a few gunfights, all of which (okay, aside from a few bits of grandstanding like the first dive off the tower platform) are entirely integral to the plot.Not for a moment did I see anything where I thought that was dumb, or contrived. Several times I was entirely surprised at the turn it took; sure in retrospect you can see how that's a 'typical' choice, but in film, it worked.Visuals are lovely. Great art direction that reminds me of the 70s era soft SF stuff, taken to a beautiful conclusion it is today. Entirely believable VFX, which is critical. If the drones looked like they were on sticks, wires, or were models, it wouldn't have worked.",9,2,2,1 February 2019
The Revenant," A weird detachment between style, form, and story
","I am surprised how much I didn't like this. I didn't even like the photography. Too many 360° pans and jumping off cliffs that make the camera a character, or at least felt very out of place in the setting (when they were very reasonable when used in Gravity, for example). Some great acting, some amazing VFX, but... no story. I mean sure there's a story, but somehow one that was so fantastical, so remote from the actions of the characters that I didn't ever connect the two so didn't feel any emotional attachment to it. Even the bear scene was the tour-de-force of film-making that everyone says while also making me have absolutely no concern for Glass.Take the opening attack, and compare it to the attack on the convoy leaving the fort in Last of the Mohicans. The latter gives you a much better sense of the geography of the action, even when they go off to the river and are chased down; this all gives the scene a distinct sense of peril. The characters might not make it. Not so in The Revenant. Even with the quite common chance of death, as people start dropping from arrows and hatchets, it all feels remote, cold, isolated. And confusing. Warriors coming from off the frame to kill someone doesn't seem frightening, so much as confusing.",5,1,2,3 August 2018
A Quiet Place," Any innovation ruined by checking-the-boxes horror movie choices
","It's a contemporary American horror movie, which means the heroes are supposed to be smart, but actually do lots of dumb things, the creatures are arbitrarily intelligent and powerful (not infinitely powerful: arbitrarily. Randomly.) and there's bog-standard This Is Scary music to tell you when something scary happens.Meh all around, but I'll say what pushed me over the edge was the music. A film entirely about how you can't talk, can't make a noise, has several scenes of (good sound editing!) noise of the breeze in the trees, quiet footsteps, etc so a giveaway noise is that much more jarring,... then just has other scenes full of incidental music. No. Hard fail. Not clever film-making but just checking-the-boxes horror movie time.",4,1,3,9 February 2020
Into the Wild," Self-aware movie about self-absorbed idiot
","For anything based (especially closely) on a true story, there is no getting away from the basics of the story. And for this one, there's no getting away from the fact that McCandless made decisions throughout the narrative so bad most 6-year-olds would do better. I have thought this since the original Backpacker article, and do not understand why anyone cares why this particular person got himself killed in the wilderness. The movie had a chance to do that regardless and I totally gave it a chance. Films can use the medium to express a different perspective even of topics that you disagree with. In that, Penn and his cohorts totally, totally failed me. It's 100% an L.A. version of what the outdoors is about, repeated encountered with what I can only characterize as the idealized version of hippie/dropout culture; really every scene to me was trite. The narration, overly-digital handwriting, and whole structure (everything, all the way through contemporary pop music every 11 minutes to set the timeframe,) completely ruined it for me and not once did I ever get totally absorbed into the story, and think I was watching anything but a TV movie.Two stars only because it was executed in a fundamentally workman-like manner, and there was no actually painful acting, mismatched footage, overly visible crew or FX, etc. But it was a close call. Bad show.",2,2,3,7 June 2013
The Artist," A charming homage to Hollywood of old... and that's it.
","There's no there, there. Dirt simple story you can see coming a mile away, so it's all about how they tell it, and it's told poorly. Pointless scene setting takes forever (that breakfast seems to have taken 1/3rd of the movie), important points skip on by. Acting and most photography is unimpressive. Too many straight on one shots. Too much mugging for the camera, too talkative, when it's a form that requires expression and movement. And too much feels like a gimmick. A silent movie it ain't. The two sound interludes make no sense. I expected it to become a sound picture with the advent of sound in film. That might have been interesting, and a way to show how the world changed overnight.",5,0,3,6 April 2017
Sausage Party," Trying too hard...
","...to be edgy or offensive, and it shows. A lot of it flowed naturally and worked fine. But closer to a quarter of the film was A Bit that was specifically sexual, or racist, or whatever, never meshed with the rest of it, interrupted the action, and usually wasn't even especially funny.Also didn't like any of the Explain What Is Happening. 4th dimension? And people high enough can see them then? No. Bad idea.Wish I could just hate it, but the core was pretty good. A sort of fully-horrifying version of Toy Story 2, with a secret life under our noses, and a terrible truth to it. Liked the premise, liked the parts that stuck to telling that story. Just, not the rest.Which really I should have expected as that's a Seth Rogen/Jonah Hill/etc film.P.S. Three story credits, four writers, and two directors? It shows.",6,1,1,4 March 2019
A Hard Day's Night," I /guess/ I am not a fan?
","Almost unwatchable. The definition of dated, in tone, style, art direction, cinematography, editing, and more. Inconsistent, lurching from long static scenes to strange little dramatic bits, to musical numbers oddly apropos of nothing. You'd think a band, on a tour, with no other structure to get in the way, could manage to make the musical numbers more integral with the film.It seems to have been stopwatch edited; every Beatle has equal screen time, so even if there's no other reason there are regular cuts to random ones mugging to the camera about what is happening elsewhere.Even forgiving the pretty atrocious acting, it's just bad.",5,0,4,24 February 2019
Godzilla," Another in a series, the American Action Movie Mess®
","Started out promising, some great cinematography, but rapidly devolved into American Action Movie Mess®Way too broad in scope, so the origin story is buried, shuffled past, and just too much is happening. The Hero is absolutely generic, in looks, as written, and has no acting ability at all. At least when we're promised the movie is full of Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche and he acts alongside one of them for a while. It sticks out. Action scenes are poorly done, so it's often hard to tell what is going on. Or, things make no sense. Or, it's just so dark you cannot tell anything is happening at all. Despite, apparently, thousands dead, there is no sense of consequences. The peril is told, not felt, not really shown. Maybe that's all they could get with PG13, but in that case: make a different movie. HORRIBLE continuity and accuracy. Forget plausibility, we can go with alternative histories and stuff, but the same buildings are destroyed multiple times, 'EMPs' work when needed for the plot instead of on all devices, a clone of SFO is in Hawaii, and Yucca Mountain is in the hills outside San Francisco, the bay is a mile deep, and much more that is distractingly stupid and awful.",5,0,0,14 August 2018
Her," Meh. Just... not really feeling it.
","Perfectly good concept behind it, and I am not one of those offended by the subject matter, because I fear technology, by some hidden politics or morality, by the sex or swearing, etc. I just didn't like it. I do not think it was especially well made, or well acted (and learning the voice actress was replaced seems to explain some of that), and really didn't like the montages. Sometimes, I was confused as to what I was supposed to know at the end of one. Last note: nice locations but they didn't work for me as I've been in exactly those places in Shanghai. So it felt a lot less Shanghai to me then Future LA. A lot. They showed recognizable buildings, so even some non-locals would figure this out, and I found that an odd choice.",6,0,0,26 June 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Will you hold it against me if I say 'Hackneyed Ridge?' Probab;y.
","This film wants to be a bio of moral courage in the face of whatever. Sure. I can see how that was the point. But they lost it on the way. And in the end, to me, absolute and 100% failure. It Is A War Movie. Have no doubts. A lot of the movie is the fighting on Okinawa, from the point of view of the armed soldiers, and their officers and NCOs. Sometimes, briefly, from the POV of the Japanese. There are occasional cuts to little vignettes of our hero doing things. But they are disjointed and have no obvious point. And the whole opening, the first hour or so, is tragically maudlin. A trite aw-shucks love story/basic training thing that turns into a slightly put-upon then triumphant but boring victory. Boring is the deal. Sure the battle scenes are gory, but what's the point of it all? I mean, in the film, why are we watching this? Why does any of it inform anything we're supposed to understand about the morality or faith of our hero? It all feels like a TED talk. A PPT that tells a Heartwarming Story of Success In Adversity. Or if you prefer, a sermon with a great story. But film should show, not tell. And this thing tells you, repeatedly, what you are supposed to think, then goes off a plays video games for a while in between.",5,2,2,21 March 2018
Draft Day," Nearly great sports procedural. Nearly.
","I have long thought that 'procedural' is a broader category than it is given credit for. Everyone believes in police procedurals, a few admit there are medical procedurals, but I think there can be anything. This is a Sports Procedural.And it works as such. A drama, wrapped around and constrained by the minutiae of the process such as the time constraint.It even has a sort of 'mystery' of discovering what the right choice is, and why. It works for me.I assume it was set up for an international market as some clever plan to make everyone love American Football, by over-explaining stuff, but I think the intros to each city, etc. worked well actually. I assume some are annoyed by this however.The core actors do a pretty good job. Costner is a bit too typical Costner but pretty good, Garner is... well, her best role is certainly credit card commercials unfortunately, but Denis Leary is excellent (and not too much like himself), Frank Langella is surprisingly nuanced for the Evil Businessman. Aside from Sam Elliott who is always awesome, the supporting cast is really, really hit and miss, with way too many misses. I suspect - knowing nothing of football - a lot were stunt casting, or gifts to the league. A few people even seemed like they should have had lines, but were edited out because they were just too awful.All in all, a pretty good story, a pretty good script, but let down by some poor acting, and some odd editing choices (oh lord, that split screen crap).",7,1,1,7 March 2019
