Minority Report," Not for the Idiots
","Minority Report is a sci-fi whodunnit that reaffirms Stanley Kubrick's paradoxical belief that the cinema can both provoke and entertain.  Set 50 years into the future, the film is about John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a detective who works for an organization called Pre-Crime which identifies and captures people just before they commit a murder.  It does so through the use of Pre-Cogs, basically three psychics in a forever trance-like state, that have premonitions of the act before it actually occurs.  The system was created by Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) and Iris Hineman (Lois Smith), and in the six years that it's been in place, there hasn't been a single murder.  So far so good. But  enter Danny Witwer (Colin Farell), an official of the Justice Department, who has some concerns of the legality and morality of the setup.  Anderton completely believes in it but Witwer doesn't feel it's right to punish the people if they haven't committed the murder yet.  Witwer also tells him that since the system was designed by humans, it's not perfect.  There's always one flaw and it's always human. Now if you thought that Steven Spielberg was finished after Saving Private Ryan, well then you clearly haven't seen this film - or you might just be an idiot.  He's taken Phillip K. Dick's short story and expanded it into a 2 hour 20 minute mind-bending race-against-the-clock thriller, complete with all the thrills, chills, and the required surprise twist that we expect from something of this scale.  His direction propels the film while still giving us a multi-layered plot without slowing down the action.  You need to pay attention to all the details because it's not an easy one to (completely) get in one viewing.  If you're the type of person who likes to leave his brain at home before heading to the theater, then I suggest Attack of the Clones or maybe Goldmember is more to your liking.  Acting-wise, Cruise, Farell, and Sydow are all good in their roles, yet it's Samantha Morton as the Pre-Cog Agatha who outshines them all.  Her chilling performance provides the movie with some of its most memorable scenes and much of the sympathy that's supposed to go to Cruise's character ends up going to her. An Oscar nomination would be well-deserved, although it's doubtful she'll get one because of the limited screen time and since Dreamworks will probably push the disappointing Road To Perdition for the awards over this film.  Technically the picture is flawless and should be a nomination sweeper with directing and picture nods going to Spielberg.  A near-masterpiece, the movie is an easy 4 out of 5.  Why not 5 stars you may ask ?  Well it's because Spielberg, as usual, puts too much of his family/love theme into the plot.  That's what ruined AI and it's also the one false note in this movie which, otherwise, is sci-fi film noir at its finest.",Null,0,0,26 November 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Adventure on the high seas
","Peg-legs, swordplay, plank walking, ships, cannons and ancient curses. Now that's what a summer movie should be. We start off in the 1700s, give or take a hundred, in an island off - where else - the Caribbean. After 30 minutes of setup and character introduction, the island is attacked by the Black Pearl which takes Elizabeth Swann -the Governor's daughter- prisoner. But this be no random pirate attack. The pirates are victims of an Aztec curse that has left them in a state of undead and need Elizabeth's medallion to break it. The roguish Cap'n Jack Sparrow, former captain of the Black Pearl, sets off after them with Will Turner, his new sidekick. That's basically the movie. Now if you're coming into this expecting an intelligent drama about the dangers of sea life, well, forget it.  Pirates is a movie whose sole purpose is to entertain, without insulting your intelligence, and entertain it does. It is one of those rare films that's good and fun, and much credit goes to Johnny Depp. One can only guess as to what compelled him to do away with the conventional Errol Flynn pirate and instead channel Keith Richards with a little PePe Le Pew. Depp is an actor who consistently rises above the script, regardless of the film's quality. The stumbling, slurred deliveries, facial expressions and goatee - things that would be out of place in another movie - only add to the performance because they fit in the context of the film. His performance is funny, eccentric, charismatic, and fully worthy of an Oscar nomination. It's time he got some recognition. Without him this would have been an average movie with a good performance from Geoffery Rush. As the mutinous first mate Barbosa, Rush also provides some humorous moments and has some good exchanges with Depp. Orlando Bloom is Will Turner, a blacksmith, who happens to be the reason for the curse. He holds his own as the movie pirate - looks, thinned mustache, ponytail - and Keira Knightley is even better as the damsel in distress. The production values - set design, costumes, cinematography -are first rate as are the special effects.  The film also benefits from a rousing score courtesy of Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer.  The movie could have spent more time in the editing room as it sometimes looses momentum. At two hours twenty minutes, it's about half hour too long. The direction is O.K. The battle scenes and sword fights could have been better choreographed. They come off flat and fail to provide any thrills. The only enjoyable one is the last one when Sparrow and Barbosa are moving in and out of the lunar beams. But these are just minor holes in an otherwise solid film. Pirates of the Caribbean is a fun swashbuckler with a good cast and should appeal to all, even if the wind occasionally goes out of its sails",Null,0,0,1 March 2004

Spider-Man 2," Better than the First? By: ABBAS H.
","A phenomenal entertainment piece with twists, turns and the occasional hero guessing his purpose.  If you like action and a series of heartfelt chuckles than this movie is right for you. Now telling you the plot is a waste of yours and more importantly my time, so lets skip that.  The movie offers you two hours of great action and humour.  You don't have to be a genius to understand the plot.  However if you are a typical ' Nobody understands me!' teenager who wants Michael Bay type action - cars and planes blowing up - than go see I, Robot.  As usual Toby Maguire, Kirstin Dunst and James Franco deliver more than believable performances that grab your attention and pull you into their characters. There are some flaws but an overall solid film. Spend your ten dollars on this movie and you won't regret it; unless you are an idiot. So sit back, enjoy and decide which one is better. But just in case you lack the proper knowledge let me put your mind - if you have one - at ease. Spiderman2 does in fact edge out the original.",Null,0,0,18 July 2004
The Last Samurai," Dances with Shogun
","Or is it?  Although the theme of an outsider becoming part of a fading culture has been told countless times - most obvious comparison being the superior Dances with Wolves - Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai is a grand and intelligent film that stands on its own.  Our tale begins in 1876 where burnt-out Civil War hero, Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), spends his days as an unconvincing drunk.  He is approached by two of the Emperor's men who want him to come to Japan and train the military in modern warfare in order to put down a Samurai rebellion.  The Samurai are fighting to preserve their culture as well as Japan's  from becoming westernized.  Eventually Cruise is captured and now has theological discussions with Katsumoto, the Samurai leader. The two men are from opposing cultures but share the same values and Cruise starts  understanding who and what the Samurai are.  The rest you can guess.  
      As you watch the story unfold, it becomes obvious that Tom Cruise has thrown himself into this role.  He read Civil War diaries, Samurai articles, took martial arts, gained thirty pounds, and grew a beard! He also learned some of the language and studied Bushido, a code of loyalty and sacrifice.  So you can't fault his preparation. Yet somehow he still comes off as Tom Cruise.  And for this movie that's all you need.  Think about it:  Who would you rather have leading you into slow motion suicide battles?  Tom Cruise or some 'character'.  Cruise looks heroically handsome whether he's pointing a rifle, spinning a sword, getting stabbed, or doing the obligatory putting-on-the-armor scene before the final battle.  His co-star, Ken Watanabe, brings a dignified presence to the role of Katsumoto.  He is also a wounded man, defending the Samurai code even though he senses the end is near.  Watanabe acts with conviction and his performance is worthy of award consideration.  The rest of the cast is fine, there are no weak links.  The movie's look is authentic and the battles are well choreographed and bloody.  But there are some pacing problems and an unnecessarily long drawn-out ending.  There is also too much of a been-there done-that feeling that is hard to ignore.  The Last Samurai is a thoughtful film - meaning it will flop - but it's not the great epic that it aspires to be.",Null,1,1,17 December 2003
