Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Critics are Idiots. The movie is quite satisfactory.
","This movie had a very tough job -- meeting up with the hype and expectations of everyone. The film does a quite satisfactory job of being entertaining (that IS what it's about, you know) without any of the problems that could have occurred. The FX are part of the story, and woven into it smoothly, so they don't look like something tacked on or the basis for it in the first place. The story threads the fine line between being complex and being 'too deep' (The events that must occur to describe the fall of a galactic  government is not easy to squeeze into the 7 or so hours available for three movies -- this does not allow for tremendous depth). The characters are rich enough that you can fill in much of what needs to be filled in, and it's fun.Find your local 'poo-poo'ing critic, and help him get his head out of that tight spot it's managed to get stuck in....",9,0,0,1 June 1999
The Fifth Element," Luc Besson is the modern Kubrik
","Each of Luc Besson's previous two movies has been impressive, and each has stretched his visible skills at storytelling. This third of Luc Besson's movies is truly a French comic book broken free of its panels -- not to be taken even remotely, momentarily seriously, it is a wonderful mixture of a comic book's childish simplicity and a movie's visual animation. Although quite violent, it is filled with sharp, witty dialogue and quick characterization, with many visual jokes and puns subtly slipped in for additional humor (the cigarette, for example, that's 75% filter). Bruce Willis's casting as the beaten down Corbin Dallas is obvious, but perfect. Gary Oldman deliciously overplays the wickedly evil Zorg, Milla Jovovitch wonderfully bounces from vulnerable to superwarrior, and the rest of the casting is equally inspired, straight down to 'Tiny' Lister as The President. The 'Mobius' inspired cityscapes and visual elements fit perfectly into the comic-book nature of the movie.No question, it *does* suffer on the small screen -- try to catch it in wide screen on a large Home Theatre system if you cannot see it at a real theatre. This movie needs to be 'big' to be truly appreciated.The world has lost its Kubrick, but it's found an obvious successor.",10,1,2,1 June 1999
American Beauty," A strangely uncategorizeable movie...
","Is it a comedy? A drama? A tragedy?This movie is all those things, yet the 'catch all' term 'dromedy' or whatever trivializes it too much. It's really hard to discuss this movie without giving something away, but it's quite good. Next to 'Fight Club', it's one of the years best, and more likely than FC to get an Oscar nomination.Spacey will almost certainly get a Nomination this year for Best Actor, and I would not be overly surprised to see other nominations, as well.The story, essentially, is of a man who has become complacent, and allowed his life to become boring and, well, 'lifeless'. It is about his growing dissatisfaction with it and his efforts to change that. But make no mistake: this isn't 'Middle Aged Crazy' -- there's far too much talent here all around to wind up with that. This film, instead, actually makes a statement about life and living that that film never even dreamed of.The thing that struck me as really odd about the film is how you feel as you walk out of it. The 'emotion' you feel isn't really what you might expect, given the ending I shan't reveal or even allude to. And that's the unique part.This is definitely a 'must see'. Six thumbs up (what can I say -- I'm an ERB Martian).",10,0,0,12 November 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," An underestimated classic... One of the best SF-Action movies ever.
","This movie is going to eventually be respected as a true classic -- The notion of the T-2000 robot is almost as significant an advancement of the concept 'robot' as Asimov's '3 laws' were 50 years ago. The effects are well integrated into the plot, and the behavior of the robot, as it develops un understanding of its own capabilities is well thought out. (The scene where the robot stares at its frozen, shattered body part is perfect. Its second fight with Arnold, where it no longer is limited to 'human' reactions to attacks is equally impressive).It should be interesting to see what Cameron's T-3 will be like (esp. after the comment 'T-3 but without me').",9,1,1,1 June 1999
Being John Malkovich," A Strange and Surreal Dark Comedy of Self and Obsession
","This movie is a highly strange and surreal look at self and obsession. Its unique premise is easily what makes the movie worth seeing, yet it really does not delve all that deeply into those questions. If you'd like to get a clue to the answers of the ideas proposed by this movie, you won't find them here -- that's why it does not get a total 'thumbs up'. But it does have a very quirky sense of humor and, on the the whole, is funny enough to be worth seeing. I don't think anyone will look back ten years from now and define this one as a 'classic', however...",8,0,0,12 November 1999
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog Day Meets Alien Invasion Action Pic
","That summary pretty much tells you the whole general plot, but it does a great job of making an interesting story out of it, nonetheless. It's not the classic that GHD was, but it's a very effective, very competent SF thriller... and for Hollywood, the fact that I said it's good SF and not merely Sci Fi says a lot. I use SF in a fairly restricted way, unlike most. This is not some deep thinking picture, though it can and could elicit some good college dorm BS sessions as can any time-travel sort of film. I would liken it in quality to another pretty good Tom Cruise pic, 'Minority Report'. I can recommend this as both an entertaining movie as well as a movie worth seeing on the big screen.",9,3,6,8 June 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Finally, DC gets their s*** together
","This is definitely up to the hype. They take two major comic events, one for Batman, one for Superman, and meld them into a single screenplay, while not slighting either. Decent characterization, decent plot, decent balance of action and story. It's not as funny as the first Avengers, nor quite as good as the 'first' X-Men (i.e., 'First Class'), but it's as good as anything DC has put into a movie, including Dark Knight, and as good as any of the better Marvel movies.Well worth your time, if you're a comic fan at all. You get to see glimpses of the other 'JLA' heroes, too -- Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman.",10,4,10,24 March 2016
Cloud Atlas," Very Good, 'Thinking' picture.
","This is not a fantastic movie, but it's a very very good one. If you go into it expecting another 'Matrix', you'll be disappointed. Like 'The Matrix', it's a thinking picture -- you'll likely leave it with friends talking about what it says and what it means -- but unlike The Matrix, it's a lot less of an action picture. There's one segment which does have a fair amount of action, but most of the story isn't filled with very much of things like that. It's a lot more 'characterization' based.The trailers are slightly deceptive, too. They make it look as though it goes from the distant past into the far future, but in reality, it spans about 500 years starting in around 1830 or so.The theme is the connectedness of all humanity, and of how what goes around comes around... Karma, in the classic sense. Even if you don't believe in Karma, it's still the kind of picture that engenders discussion about why you, or those around you, believe or disbelieve.I'd suggest its cinematography does make good use of the large screen, and will suffer on the small one... so it should be seen in a theater and not just in the home cinema.",9,4,15,28 October 2012
