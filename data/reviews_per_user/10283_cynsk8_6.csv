The New World," Poetic and Impressionistic
","The New World Critics were split on the merits of this movie. As of this posting, the movie managed to garner a 54 on Rotten Tomatoes.com. Few people however, seemed to appreciate the poetic essence and impressionistic nature of this film and instead considered it dull and uninteresting.If your a fan of epic historical tales with sweeping sequences of action and intrigue, then this film may disappoint. It is much more an exercise in somber reflection and tacit emotion. Nature and the beauty of an unspoiled land are placed in the forefront, whereas the colonist invaders are held at somewhat of a distance. Pocahantas is decidedly the only character with color and life. If you are a fan of Colin Farrell or Christian Bale, this movie is also for you-they both were beautiful.",8,4,8,23 January 2006
Alexander," Beautiful, and Not Just Colin
","An all around beautifully done film. There has been so much negative press about this film, but it truly serves it's purpose, to portray one of the most powerful and enigmatic men in history. The writer should be appreciated for his use of poetic license in depicting what would have had to have been an eccentric, power hungry megalomaniac. Even the sexuality, which has been criticized relentlessly, was beautifully done. Lest this Christian-centric society forget, Alexander was a pagen and lived in a culture where bi-sexuality was frequent if not almost normal. It is ridiculous to assign western conservative morals to this movie.Angelina Jolie was sensuous, mysterious and dogmatic and was a perfect choice to play Olympias. Colin Farrell was simply beautiful and we only needed to see more of him. Pish Posh to all the critics out there who poo pooed this movie-it was what a historical epic movie should be. Long, drawn out with great scenery and a beautiful hero. I wish it had been 2 hours longer.",8,4,12,23 December 2004
Brokeback Mountain," A Must See
","Not Quite but Almost spoilers****** Well, not for the lack of trying, we finally made it into a sold out showing of the newest Golden Globe winner. For all the hype I was expecting a slam dunk best picture nominee, however the reaction was more 'what was all the hype about.' This movie is unquestionably a must see. It is ground breaking on so many levels and challenges one to remember the profound obstacles to being gay in America.Brokeback is every bit about story. Except for the expansive shots of BIG Sky country, above average performances by Heath and some very emotional sex scenes, to me this movie lacked the necessary elements of a 'best picture' film. Don't misunderstand, I thought the movie was amazing, it drew me in and I did not feel the time passing. Clearly the 'best adapted screenplay' Oscar is a shoe in.What seems to resonate most about this picture is forbidden love that is so deeply hidden and denied. It is this contrast between sweeping all encompassing love and deep tormenting anguish that makes you feel constant tension and discomfiture.",8,5,6,23 January 2006
Closer," A Great Surprise
","I expected a mediocre picture and instead was pleasantly surprised. I was also amazed that upon leaving the theatre, audience members were commenting that it was the worst movie they'd ever seen. Hummm, there is no accounting for taste, audience members at the same theatre walked out last month on Finding Neverland. For anyone with an appreciation of good storytelling, witty dialog and great acting, this is the movie to see. Although one felt strangely about laughing at so serious a story, there was the inevitable confrontation scene between Larry and Dan and one could not help but be amused. Clive Owen was wonderful and the dialog in this scene was some of the best this year. Please see this movie and hope that it wins many Oscars for some truly great performances.",8,1,1,23 December 2004
The Da Vinci Code," The Critics are Wrong this Time
","Critics have flamed this film and I have to say I think they were wrong and overly biased. This is not the first time this year where professional reviews were just plain off base. Come on, who really thought MI III deserved a 70% on the tomato meter. MI III had to be one of the worst movies ever, and I love action movies and have seen tons of them. I'm usually pretty dead on with critics of my assessment of a film.Reading all of the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, I just don't buy that the story was flat. Let's face it, the book, although a page turner, was not an action packed thriller. It was more of a slow evolving mystery-thriller. Hello, that's why a 2 ½ hour movie was necessary. Although I do agree that Tom Hanks was wrong for the role and that Ron Howard is a sucky director anyway, this movie did NOT deserve an 18 on the tomato meter.I saw the movie in Lake Mary, Fla and the audience clapped when it was over. I thought the film did what the book didand that is appeal to the average American audience. I read one review on IMDb that pointed out the lack of European flair, but this movie was made for Americans, by Americans. Who is more American than Opie? So why the crummy reviews? I think critics and movie snobs alike, all got on the band wagon to pick apart one of the most anticipated movies of our generation. Let me say here, that I don't believe this movie deserved a 90%, or even an 80% for that matter. But an 18??? Who are we kidding. The movie was very respectable. It had good pacing and took time to elaborate the details, albeit multiple times, but it was very necessary to get the whole point across.Everyone that I have spoken too really liked the movie and seemed to get a lot out of it. It may not be a work of cinematic genius on par with the likes of the top movies of last season, but certainly did the book justice.",7,0,3,20 May 2006
V for Vendetta," Everyone must see this provocative but important movie.
","V for Vendetta explores one man's courage to stand up to a government that continues to isolate its constituency. Not unlike the Frodo character in Lord of the Rings, V is one insignificant human that inspires a nation and changes the course of its history. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) plays the enshrouded V, who, within the course of a year turns the tide of a fascist and oppressive dictatorship. On a more symbolic level, the movie reminds viewers how seemingly insignificant violations of liberty can lead toward the consolidation of power.On a historical note, one need only know a tad bit of British history to really appreciate the metaphor behind the lead character V.The Facts: Guy Fawkes (April 14, 1570January 31, 1606) was an English soldier and a member of a group of Roman Catholic conspirators who attempted to carry out the so-called Gunpowder Plot in 1605. The plot was an attempt to assassinate King James I of England (James VI of Scotland) and the members of both houses of the Parliament of England. To do this, Westminster Palace was to be blown up during the formal opening session of the 1605 Parliament, in which the king would address a joint assembly of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Guy Fawkes was in large part responsible for the later stages of the plan's execution. His activities were detected, however, before the plan's completion. Following a severe interrogation involving the use of torture, Fawkes and his co-conspirators were executed for treason and attempted murder. Guy Fawkes is remembered with Guy Fawkes Night on November 5",Null,5,10,26 March 2006
