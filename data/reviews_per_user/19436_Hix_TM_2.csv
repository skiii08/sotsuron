Requiem for a Dream," Short-Point
","Not much can be said that hasn't already, but I'm unsure if the following point has been made:This film isn't about drug usage, but about drug addiction. Aronofsky isn't saying that drug use leads to destruction (In fact, I believe the man is a cigarette smoker himself), he's merely pointing out the troubles of abusing drugs and becoming addicted to them.",Null,0,0,4 December 2001
Blow," Brilliant, yet self-destructive.
","Make no mistake... this is a film that not many people will like. It is not the crazy comedy of Fear and Loathing, nor the Gangster/Crime life of Goodfella's.In fact, it's a parent/child drama piece, but it's about a drug dealer. This is its problem. Whilst its theme centres around family and the notion of success, the narrative is of a drug dealer. Therefore, most people who normally would have emotional interest in the themes are going to be put off by the drug connotations, and the ones interested in the drugs won't give a damn about the family thing.I urge all people to see this film. It's about family, particularly a father/son relationship, so go in expecting that. Anyone put off by the drugs connection should go see it for an education and anyone put off by the moral centre should go see it, because what it says about family is important.",Null,0,0,20 July 2001
