Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A very funny film overshadowed by an even dirtier mind.
","It's saddening to see an actor wasting his talent as a great comedian by exposing his sexual perverted mind.The film had the potential of being a great comedy were it not for the fact that 80% of the jokes were about immoral as one can get.Personally, I am appalled by Mr. Cohen's expectations that we viewers are on his level and will embrace and enjoy his nonstop indecent script.Take for example the Movie 'The Bird Cage' (Robin Williams, Nathan Lane) about a son of a bi-sexual couple coping to get married without the bride's parents knowing that. It's pure comedy with little if any indecent writing. Would it be for Mr. Cohen, that film would be a marathon of filthy episodes. One final comment: The proper rating for this movie is NC-17. If this movie doesn't deserve an NC-17 which one does?",3,5,11,28 November 2006
