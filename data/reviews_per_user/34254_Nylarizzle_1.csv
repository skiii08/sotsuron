Come and See," All five senses
","Before this movie started we were prepared for the gruesome scenes so I was quite nervous to start this film. As soon as the film started and his voice was so raspy and creepy that I thought this movie was going to be much more dreadful then it really turned out to be. 'Come and See' was such a powerful movie and sent me through an emotional roller coaster. In the beginning of this story you see a 12-year-old Florya(Alexi Kravchenko),who is willing and excited to join and fight for his honor. It takes you through his raw journey of his process of being hardened through this war. He stumbles across Glasha and they are immutably bonded with her by the explosions, which leaves him temporarily deaf with a horrible hum that is throughout the movie. This is when things started to get odd. They go back to the village where he was from to see his mother and finds an unsettling mound of bodies..'Come and See' is a deeply raw and dark film. Watching this movie and watching Florya go through these struggles there is a sadness and a feeling of stress. This is a movie where you use all five of your senses. I could not just relax and enjoy this movie without it pulling me into the rawness of this war. The acting was beautifully done, and they really bring you into this movie and make you feel everything they experience. This was a great movie that I honestly would never have known about but am glad I got a chance to see it. It has opened my eyes.",9,1,1,7 June 2010
