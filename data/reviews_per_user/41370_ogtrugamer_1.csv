Come and See," A very sad and unsettling movie
","I don't think I've ever seen a movie that comes close to this in terms of depicting real violence and cruelness of humans and the effects a war can have on a young boy. This movie will stay to haunt you long after you've seen it so word of warning to those who rather not have these images stuck to your head.There are many effects which give the movie an uneasy feeling; the sound of the airplane at the beginning that sometimes circles above at other points too is haunting to say the least, and the cow's eye moving wildly when it's dying is unsettling to say the least. Not to mention the screams of the people who get burned in the cabin...War is hell and this film will definitely show it better than any Hollywood-flicks with censor could. Recommended watching to anyone who can handle it.",9,2,2,5 April 2019
