The Rock," Superb acting, excellent writing, great plot. 'The Rock' Kicks ass.
","This film is SADLY Underrated. An explosive thrill ride. Captivating from beginning to it's end. This movie easily could have been another action movie thrown together to make money. Every aspect of 'The Rock' shines; The performances are phenomonal, Hanz Zimmer's Composing is amazing(I highly suggest going to downloading the main theme off any file sharing)the direction is good, the charactors are well developed, solid, unlike a hulking retard who walks around aimlessly with a huge machine gun such as rambo...Any American will feel compassion about American soldiers losing their lives and not being honored or remembered Which is a the cause of the action in the film. General Hummel 'Possibly the greatest battalion commander of the vietnam war'. A great military leader who was very successful in his aray of missions. For the troops that died under his command during blackOps missions (blackops meaning secret, planned and prepared by the US Goverenment, but never made public) were never given medals, money to their families 'These men died for their country and weren't even given a military burial.' Hummel puts together his own team of troops and takes over Alcatraz with 81 hostages and 14VX Gas Warheads and demands the money from the U.S. Government. Brilliant job to everybody involved in the production. 'The Rock' is my favorite movie of all time. Hats off Connery, Cage, Hans Zimmer, Micheal Bay, David Morse, andDON SIMPSON!",10,3,3,8 August 2001
