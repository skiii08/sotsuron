Alien 3," Excellent addition to the trilogy
","Let's forget there was a part four.Alien cubed, as I affectionately call it (that's what it looks like, a mathematic equation) didn't sit right with me the first time I saw it, which was in the theatre.After I had a chance to buy the video and watch it several times, it grew on me. It's a dark and grizzly painting of solitude and terror. After the all-out shoot 'em up of Cameron's Aliens, it was refreshing return to the 'we've got no weapons' point of view. It also restored the science-fiction style of storytelling that was for the most part absent in number two.It's an excellent story with very good flow. I loved the conversation with the inmates as they debate their philosophy (religion) of prison life on a planet with no females. I also enjoyed the multiple conversations Ripley had with the doctor. Very quiet and serene. A couple of elements that are hard to find in Aliens.I realize I keep comparing to it's predecessor but this movie was the perfect fit for third slot of the Alien installments. Aliens got us all worked up into an adrenaline rush of 'gotcha' terror and Alien 3 let us relax and enjoy a good story.Because of this and director David Fincher's other works, I'll definitely be looking forward to his future films.",8,0,4,21 May 1999
