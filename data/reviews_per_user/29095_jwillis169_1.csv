The Blair Witch Project," This movie is utter drivel. Period!
","Probably the worst movie I have ever seen, with the possible exception of Wild, Wild WestAll this movie did was give me a headache with all the camera bouncing. And it wasn't even an enjoyable headache.  There was absolutely nothing scary about this movie.  In fact, it was completely unscary.  It was like watching a really really boring, poorly made public access TV documentary.  Ooohhh, and the script!!  Any third grader could have written it: 'What the &%$#&!! was that??!!'  repeated over and over for 2 hours, without even changing inflection ... how creative.(MINOR SPOILERS - but who cares, if you haven't seen it, don't, it's complete crap ... and if you have, you already know, so...)The were 2 parts of this movie that I found *somewhat* worthwhile:  What I like to call the 'Bundle o' Josh' was good for about 30 seconds of spine tingling, and the last 2 minutes were definitely a worthwhile scare ... but this does not come close to making up for the complete disappointment of the first hour and a half plus.I paid a dollar to see this at a discount theatre.  The way I look at it, someone owes me about 89 cents.* out of ***** (if I believed in giving 0 stars, this would be it)",1,2,5,25 August 2003
