Requiem for a Dream," One of the most compelling, gut wrencching, thought provoking movies, about drug addiction, ever made;
","Although this film was originally slapped with an NC-17 rating, the gratuity and brutal honesty in the depiction of drug abuse and human emotion, should not be censored to the young demographic; it should be praised, even pushed, on the young people in this country. Schools should show this film in Health class, Rehab clinics should show it to their patients; and yes, most importantly; Parents should see this with their children. 110 minutes of gut wrenching reality is better then a lifetime of addiction, and that would send the message home very quickly to teenagers, thinking of experimenting with drugs.Easy Oscar nomination for Ellen Burstyn. Also wouldn't be surprised if this got an Oscar nod for editing, score, director, and film. This film will stand the test of time, and will be the household poster board for PSA'S around the world.",Null,0,0,9 October 2000
