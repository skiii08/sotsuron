Despicable Me 2," Not Terrible
","I actually paid to take the kids to this movie in the theaters. It's a feel good, cute little kids' comedy. We rented it this week and the kids have watched it over and over, so obviously it appeals to them. However the more I watch it, the more I can't stand how terribly they animated Kristen Wiig's character. Her lines are really funny, but they got the facial expressions all wrong. Drives me bonkers.Overall, it's not terrible and you'll laugh a a few times. I just think they ruined Lucy in animation.The kids will like it, though. Even the ''annoying'' menu screen seems to captivate them.",6,0,0,13 February 2014
