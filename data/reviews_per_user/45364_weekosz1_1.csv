","I don't know if you're watching the same movie as me (reviewers with vote 8,9,10) , but i can review this movie only one word --> boring.I can't agree with that kind rating 8,9,10 of this movie.Although the director did a great job and the publishers also.Special effects are 10/10.Sound & Music is 10/10.The plot is interesting for 15 min. than it becoming monotonous and the end is a mind manslaughter of innocent history teacher for 'better' egoist cause. No , this movie doesn't appeal to me.",2,10,17,7 May 2011
