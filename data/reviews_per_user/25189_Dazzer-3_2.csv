Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The film was great
",I thought that the film was great and i can't wait for Episode II to come out in 2002. The lightsabre battles had been improved greatly from the originals and the special effects were brilliant. i recommend this film to anybody who wants a good day out at the cinema,9,13,18,9 September 1999
The Mummy," Not that bad
",The Mummy had some very good special effects and it was very loud which made me jump. but the storyline was not that spectacular and i didn't think that it was worth the money to go and see it. If you want my advice go and see it for the special effects but nothing else.,4,0,0,11 September 1999
