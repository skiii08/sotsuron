Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," NO disappointment in this sequel
","Talking about sequels, more often than not, they are disappointment compared to the original. But this team has done again. They brought back the sequel with quality. I enjoyed this film as much as I did in the first part. The action, thrill, intelligence, all are placed perfectly in this film. The screenplay and making pattern is pretty much same as the first part and story moving in good pace. The main characters did a fantastic job once again. Holmes and Watson chemistry is perfect and delivered a great performance. Here I really like the way how the hero and villain play their games, both are very clever and the equality was very interesting. Simply, if you liked the first part, just go for this one. This is perfect entertainment and No disappointments.",10,156,254,23 December 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Watch it just as a movie, you won't be disappointed
","First of all I am not the one who played this game and want to see what they did in the movie. So I had no expectations. I was expecting a movie which is filled with action and fun ride. Prince of Persia just delivered exactly that.Lets start with what I enjoyed. First the CGI and special effects, which was just awesome. Very well done. I felt like I was travelling in the Arabian desert. Second one is casting. I was bit surprised to see Jake Gyllenhaal in this role because this is an action movie. He is a normal size guy who was just after girls. But here, oh boy! he just looked like a perfect action hero. He build physically and really good to see him as an action hero. Very good transition (this don't happen too often). He richly deserved some prise for his efforts. Gemma Arterton, perfect and just looked as a beautiful princess Tamina. Other than these two, I felt everybody did their job well enough.In the making side, the action scenes are very good, lots of fun and humour, good graphics, I couldn't see any flaws in the making. Only thing I would say wasn't great is the script, but still it was good enough. As I said if you are looking for a fun and adventure, with no expectations, this is really worth it.I give 8/10 for this and I was really enjoyed.",10,23,50,22 May 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A visual treat, just like LOTR
","First of all, The Hobbit, as we all know, is a prequel to the LOTR. So technically, there would be nothing different. How can it be any different?. It will be the same Shire or Rivendell or Mountains or any creature. So The Hobbit will not satisfy the viewers who are expecting surprise like the LOTR did. Story, its about the hobbit, who is not a brave warrior or hero. So, stop expecting another surprising film like LOTR. This will be a familiar film for all the LOTR fans.If you cut down your expectation, You have everything to look for. This film has a nice story, wonderful action sequences, very good performances and ground breaking visual effects. Cast and the technical team did their job perfectly. You don't need know anything else actually.Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing the Middle Earth to big screen again, that too in 3D.",10,9,20,15 December 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," Well executed and acted fiction film
","After watching the trailer I thought this film is going to be very similar to 'Source code'. Then I questioned myself why would Tom Cruise star in a film which is similar to a popular cult film. So I've have decide to watch it. Oh boy, I was surprised. It's nothing like anything before.It's a simple storyline or not so simple. A coward major with no combat skills thrown in to a most brutal battle. With no combat skills what so ever he dies there brutally. Then shockingly he wakes up a day before(watch the film to understand why). He realises situation that that war is impossible to win, and he had to die every time, wake up a day before, go to war again and die again until it's won. What I like about this movie is the plot which was the biggest sea landing in WW2, D-day. Everything has been put together perfectly well in to this plot. The emotional depth, humour and the performance from the cast were amazing. Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton probably at their best. Though its the same day again and again, the things slowly starting change every time he restarts the day. The flow and progress is really well put together by the Director. Doug Liman back to his 'Bourne Identity' best. Overall a satisfying edge of the seat action/science fiction film after a while. A must watch.",10,3,6,8 June 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," 'Not everything, Not Yet' - Finale that Bruce Wayne deserves
","Ever since 'The Dark Knight' was released I was so curious to see how this all going to end for Bruce Wayne more than the Batman (you cannot end Batman). The plot still connects to the first and second instalment. That shows the brilliance of the script writers. Bane as a villain, was a good performance by Tom Hardy and menacing. After Joker, you cannot better, at least you have good enough. All the other supporting cast did their job really well. Christian Bale once again showed what a fantastic actor he is. Technically the film is brilliant. The vision is really big and wide from the director and the cinematographer. They came up with some fantastic mind blowing action sequences. You don't have Batman appearance often, but when ever he enters I got goose bumps. Music is fantastic as usual and very appropriate. All the credit should go to Nolan for creating a master piece trilogy in this genre. He continues he reputation of making film with thrill and emotion. After Dark Knight, when you know you cannot create a batter film than that, he was still managed to come up with a film like this.Overall, Brilliant and very satisfying Finale to Bruce Wayne and the Batman.",10,7,15,5 August 2012
Black Panther," Performances and CGI wont help if it's poorly written or lack of story
","Ever since i watched the trailer and they started using this 'all black' marketing strategy, it kind of showed there is nothing else in the movie. But my friends recommended it so I gave it a go (later I came to know they haven't seen many marvel films). Sadly I was disappointed as this an average flick. Storywise, there is nothing much. It starts well, entertaining and made me curious. But sadly after 30 min or so, it turned into a below average film. No consistency in characters. W'Kabi turns negative all of sudden and surrenders in the end all of sudden? Ulysses Klaue character was well setup, but ends suddenly!. The story, scenes are pretty much loopy, predictable and long, poor dialogues (like - are you ok?, yes i'm ok). So many scenes are redundant, two long challenge scenes with same pattern and same dialogues and length, long drinking the potions scenes, three times getting buried and visiting ancestor - could have trimmed these repeating scenes, but it could cost the movie length badly i suppose as there is nothing else to show. Couple of good action scenes, though climax is a war sadly nothing worth mentioning.Good performances from all of them. King's sister was brilliant and funny. The girlfriend and general did their part brilliantly. Andy Serkis was good but nothing much to it in the story, Michael B. Jordan was menacing, but not doing much after that. Chadwick Boseman physically he looks like a kid in the challenge scenes (maybe he is nothing without black panther potion!).Overall good CGI and performance, but because its poorly written it fails to engage. I dont understand the hype and biased reviews! maybe it has something to do with 'all black' thing instead of based on how the movie actually is.",4,13,26,22 March 2018
