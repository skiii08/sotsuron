The Avengers," The heroes are back and they are here to stay.
","Marvel Studios has the mighty super heroes come together and battle against evil to stop the invasion and capture of the planet Earth. Collectively the super heroes are called the Avengers; Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, the Hulk, the Black Widow and Hawkeye. Iron Man is played by Robert Downey Jr. who is a boy genius playboy until he's wearing his super-robotic--suit and fighting crime. Thor is played by Chris Hems worth a demigod, protector of the 9 realms, with the mighty and powerful hammer. Captain America is played by Chris Evans, the first super hero that was known to man; has great strength and a powerful and authoritative shield. The Hulk is played by Mark Buffalo who is a mild-mannered bright scientist that specializes in gamma radiation until he gets angry; and then he expands into a green muscle creature that smashes anything in its path. Then there's Natasha or better known as the Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson; specializes in spy stuff and mind tricks. Finally Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner carries a bow and arrows demanding respect and justice by using his impeccable shooting skills to take down the aliens. The theme of the movie hovers around separate egotistical super heroes that mature, bond together to form a family called The Avengers to stop an alien invasion for world dominance; the whole theory of leaving playboy-party-puberty time and becoming an adult with high morals. The Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division or S.H.I.E.L.D. is an international peace keeping agency; has located the mysterious Tesseract device and the Army's super soldier Captain America. The Tesseract is actually a gateway to an entirely new world of the powerful gods called Asguard. When S.H.I.E.l.D. activates and starts recording the Tesseract's energy output; the evil God and brother to Thor known as Loki transports through the Tesseract and enters Earth; immediately assumes that he can rule all human beings.Nick Fury played by Samuel L. Jackson, the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. takes this thievery of Loki as a terrorist act on Earth; starts to form a highly decorated task force, The Avengers; motivates them to use their combined skills to stop Loki and lizard- looking- mindless-army.The theme of this movie, leaving playboy-party-puberty time behind and becoming an adult with high morals, is a theme that has been used through movies for decades. The most famous movie that comes to my mind immediately is the movie Star Wars part 4, The New Hope. Luke Skywalker starts off as an unsure, mischief-trouble- finding, no direction young adult to a mature, self-controlled, high morals, team player to defeat evil. The use of special sound effects when the super heroes are in action just grab your attention, pull you to the edge of your set, and personally made me feel like I just pummeled my arch-enemy and showed him how an insignificant little wimpy of a boy that he truly is. The special technique to be able to actually write, direct, and tie all the Marvel Hero movies together to enable the viewer have such feeling and meaning of freedom, comradery, and defeating evil.The Avengers movie is a classic good defeats evil, action adventure, adrenaline-rush feel good movie. After watching this movie you feel the sense of happiness and calming effect that there are higher more powerful beings that will protect you at all costs.",8,1,4,29 September 2014
