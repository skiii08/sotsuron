Catch Me If You Can," A HIGHLY ENJOYABLE MOVIE
","Thanks to the fact, that it was made by a truth story. The story itself is simply superb, maybe a little too light-weighted to become a masterpiece. Spielberg & Hanks did their's job as we expected from them, while a pleasent surprise came from DiCaprio, who managed to get rid of the Titanic-look-a-like style and gain some acting abilities. But the best performance came from supporting actor Christoper Walken. An Oscar play. Catch me if you can is one of the best movies in 2002 and if it wouldn't be a little slow paced at the end, it would sure win the title - a classic movie.8 out of 10.",8,0,1,19 February 2003
Se7en," ONE OF THE BEST THRILLERS FROM '90s
","What defines a good thriller? A good story. No doubt. But what defines superb thriller? A good story told differently than in any other thrillers. Some movies succeed in that, while other doesn't. Se7en succed. With it's great 'film noir' touch (rain, scenography, type of acting,...), superb story with surprises following one after another, great acting by Brad, Morgan, Kevin & Gwyneth and a intelligent touch of directing by David Fincher (also used in his next masterpiece Fight club, 7/10).

12 Monkeys," WOW, IT WAS GREAT TO SAW,...
","...this movie again. Why, may you ask?Well, the nineties was the golden era for H'wood movies and this is one of the great specimen from this period. A strong, 'dark' story, almost as good as in Bladerunner. Bruce and Brad in their best performance till then, beautiful Madeleine Stowe (o.k., at least where she wore blonde hair:) made this movie almost perfect. It's a movie made for intelligent viewer, who appreciate the amount of details, which are involved in the story. Why not giving this movie 10 out of 10, than?Although the movie is filled with originality, i was a little disappointed by the ending. It was too predictable to make this movie immortal. Sorry, Terry. Despite that, it may not be one of the 10 my favorite movies of all times, but it isn't far away from being one, and that's why almost 9.8 out of 10.",8,0,1,11 September 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," COULD AND SHOULD BE BETTER...
","...judging by high ratings on Imdb. But still watchable enough that 2,5 hours goes by pretty fast. On the other hand, this movie will soon be forgotten, why? Well, for the story itself, i believe. It provides already seen stuff: a love story (a terrible part of the movie, since you can't feel any chemistry between Will (lousy play by Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (a mediocre play by Keira Knightley), pirate duels (some of them way too long) and a simple story (meant for kids and not so intelligent adults), without any twists. On the other hand, there's Johnny Depp, which is the main star, what he proves by great acting. With a slightly more capable director and screenwriters which could change the script and made it in a love story with Jack & Elizabeth (heh, like in Beauty & Beast), this movie will certainly gain some points with more demanding viewers and become a classic romance movie. Too bad, since the sound part is also great.Since it's not a classic, but somewhat between, only (but still good)7 out of 10.",7,0,1,10 October 2003

","Easy? Take a good looking (probably blond) girl and a handsome guy (successful, probably working in advertising), sexy cliches like motorbikes, sexy clothing, cool apartment. Put all this into a romantic twisting plot with happy end. And yes, add some humor lines. You'll win, since there is always a market for people who lives their romantic fantasies throughout the movie. Well, nothing wrong with that. If the movie includes chemistry with leading actors, original plot with the unexpected twists at the end (happy, naturally), a laughable humor and memorable love scenes.

","Why?   Well, hard to say , but after every time i have seen this movie, i discovered something new. It's about a poetry and it's watchable like a poesy. It's about being brave. It's about seizing the day. And if you saw this movie, you certainly seized the day. It's one of this movies, that i would be sad if i missed it. Real sad. First a lot of credit goes to the great Peter Weir, who certainly know his business, then it's the beautiful scenary and setting, not to mention the Jarre's music. I could mention the actors, but i won't. O.k. maybe in one word. Pure brilliance. I guess i could talk in superlatives of this movie for hours, but i won't. Watch this movie.

Insomnia," ONE OF THE BETTER MOVIES...
","...coming from, a this year, very poor Hollywood production. Fairly good story, some twists, but most of the things were excepted and that's what I resent this movie most. Although Al Pacino fits perfectly for this 'insomnia-look-a-like' role. And he plays it with style. Pacino style. Others were pretty much unnoticed, including Robin Williams. The directing by Nolan is also on the level, though nothing special, as the rest of the movie. But, despite that, this movie is worth watching, otherwise you'll missed beautiful Alaska scenes and the legendary Pacino. Maybe I have rated this movie too low, but hey, it's a little above average, so that's why a6 out of 10. (plus applause for Pacino).",6,0,0,11 October 2002
We Were Soldiers," HOW MEL BECOMES RAMBO.
","We were soldiers is a movie about Vietnam war. But, does it show us, the real tragedy and stupidity of the war? The traumatic experience of all the young man who suffered for the stupid cause in the foreign country?
No, instead that, they provide us an half an hour of romance in a poor 'Pearl Harbor way' and an hour and a half of fighting, with Mel Gibson as a 'Braveheart'. Fighting, suitable only for those who enjoyed Rambo type of a movies with a better injury effects. Since I nearly fell a sleep in this one, i couldn't rate it higher. Infact, like one of the critic wrote, U.S. vets deserve better movies, like Born on the fourth of July (10 out of 10) made by Oliver Stone.

Partly because I watched it as a kid and partly because, sometimes just feel good to watch a 'no-brainer'.-SPOILERS-It provide all elements of 80's flick...cool, easy-rock music, happy end, lame emotions, simple dialogs and if you want...Ray-ban glasses. But does it have something that makes it different from the others. Hmmm...Arm-wrestling? A kid who travels as a baggage and survives?-END OF SPOILERS-Ehh, who cares. It's Stallone movie, meaning a lot of nonsense, easy story and sentimental moments. Watching it, as a kid in eighties, was a lot of fun, now it's just a lot of thinking:'Why the hell did I rent this one?'But still, since it made me remember those happy days in 80's, when everybody dreamed to become next Sly, it deserves a strong4 out of 10.",4,1,5,8 October 2004

Or date a casual neighbourhood friend?These are just some answers on which Bridget (playing Renee Zellweger, a perfect pick for this role, btw) wants answers. Will she find it? Well watch the movie and see it for your self, as for me, I didn't search the answers with her, I just simply enjoyed an hour and half romantic comedy (heh, with a touch of British humor), though i would prefer that Hugh Grant would play a casual-looking guy with a 'deer-pullover' instead of 'woman-just-can-resist-me' type of boss.

Some action scenes, a guy gets killed and a daughter does hers best to revenge it. Throw in some (in this case NOT) funny lines, a love scene or two, some explosions and computer tricks and whoa, you get a a movie.

No. Neither did a Fed-ex employee, till he hit the deadly ground of the tiny island in Pacific. Great story for a movie, huh?A story who cries out to become a masterspiece movie. Did it?Well Tom Hanks proved once more that he is one of the best actors around (although he proved his talent much more in academy awarded Philadelphia and Forrest Gump), Heln Hunt did his part correctly, while others are un-noticed. Why didn't I grade this movie better? Hmm, mostly it was too long...there are some scenes which are totally unnecessary, and I guess that this is the director's blame. Plus there are some minor things that bothered me...for instance...after the crash he collected all of the crates, but he opened it in a day or two. Why?

The Exorcist," JUST DIDN'T CONVINCED ME
","What means, I wasn't that scared during the movie as i supposed too, since it is a horror. But than again, horror movies aren't really my type of genre, that's why i was more focused on play and movie effects. Sadly, none of them were that special to call this one the best horror movie of all time. A girl gets possessed by devil. She got save by the priest. Plus some vomiting effetcs and bed moving. And that pretty much covers the action. On the other hand, this movie provides some unusual scenes. such as the one in hospital, some interesting dialogs and 'strong' language, which wasn't so frequent in seventies. Most of this praise goes to the director of this movie.  Maybe this movie was way ahead when it was made, but since it didn't make me fall from chair when the scary scenes were played, I can only rate it by

To be honest, it was pretty hard to top the 'jigsaw' methods from the first two parts, but at least you could feel the sympathy for the torturing ones, while in this parts the characters are too week to feeling sorry for them. Except Jeff (Angus Macfayden), who's role is well performed.Still, if you are 'jigsaw fan' or just dig the first two parts, you'll find some interesting moments, but you won't talk a day after about them, as you did in the previous parts.

","All star cast, capable director, a remake with a classy story involving a bunch of twists, cool music score,...Is there absolutely anything that prevents these one to be a classic? A classic like Scorses's Casino? Well, theoretically...Only one thing. More demanding viewers will find it too shallow, some may even say, that there is a lack of chemistry in love story, but perhaps the biggest blame was, that the actors just didn't do their job correctly. That the entire crew looked just 'too cool', wearing classy clothes, big smiles and trendy sun-glasses.Ups, i named more than one thing, so the impression is, I didn't liked the movie. Errr, wrong.

The president jumps into the F-16 and saves the earth. Arghhhhh... Oh yeah, and the dog survives. I could say i even liked this movie, when it first came out.

I haven't notice such a dull script since...Pearl Harbour maybe. And since i'm the citizen of the earth, the funny showing of US patriotism...till Pearl Harbour.
All in all, you could say that Pearl Harbour is the sequel to ID4. It contains everything. Beside, dull script and US patriotism, a 'puke up' love story, stupid officers dialogs ('the world needs you, son' style), a friend dying, someone sacrificing for the good of the nation, needless humor scenes...Anyway, not all US movie are that corny.

And a wild world in the start of the 19th century.Do we have a legend of the nineties here ?   In some aspects...yes. There's plenty more than just a H'wood love story, Brad Pitt and emotions. In some place, there are hidden messages of what life is all about. That death is a part of live, just as a birth is and discovering who you are. Oh yes, and there is one unforgettable (and for my opinion the best) scene in this movie...the one where father writes on the table...I'm happy. Do we need more words here? On the other hand, it's true that, although great, music it's at some places to loud. Heh, and a scene or two with the Brad totally unnecessary.

That they live in country, where can't you trust anyone, especially your government? Where it's dangerous to be a president with a guts?Hard enough! But, all i can say is, that Stone had a guts to made a movie, that proves all this facts and shows us, who doesn't live in the U.S. such a different perspective on the States. And he did it great.

So what's missing to beat a legendary 'Lepa sela, lepo gore'?Hmmm, for my taste it's just too...simple. Not exceptional (except the last shot of the 'dead man' lying).Although, there were some better movies taped in the past few years in the region of the former YU (heh, it's still gives me a chill, when i think about Serbian movie 'Rane', probably the best movie made in these years.

","Why?Well, if you like original jokes (sometimes silly, but hey, what can you expect from 2 dumb guys), nice story and mostly black orientated humor (ahhh, the unforgettable scene with parrot...) than these is the movie for you.Sure, some will dislike Jim Carrey's impression of Jerry Lewis, although his 'monkey scenes' goes along in this movie (hmmm, what is hard to say for Pat detective 2 & Me, myself and Irene). Jeff Daniels did his part O.K. too. And yet we must not forget super-sexy Lauren Holly who fitted perfectly for her role.

No, respecting Eminem for what he did in his life, I must say that movie is quite watchable. And got a very hot scene in car factory with Alex (a great play by Brittany Murphy). O.k. plus some superb hip-hop battles.But those two things aren't enough to put this one above average. Eminem play was o.k., but hey, he played itself, while others (apart from before mentioned Brittany Murphy) were unnoticeable. Even Kim Basinger.

Sharon looking sexy as always and too bad her role is so small. Music score and around effects just add a the cream on the pie.All in all, you'll probably enjoyed this one as i did (referring to high imdb ratings).

And finally not bad acting, not bad at all. Especially praise goes to support role played by hotel manager (Hector Alizondo).All of this before mentioned facts saves this one from being judge just as one in a million love flicks coming from 'the land of dreams' who were soon forgotten after release.

Needless to say, that I got nearly bored in first half an hour, but what I resent this movie the most, is the fact, that this is just another Hollywood 'love-can-conquer-all' type of movie, what reminds me of a poor Pearl Harbor.The movie should provide more, especially for the more demanding viewers, than just a simple love story. I had the feeling that the director just haven't enough courage, to show us the real John Nash. Like Oliver Stone did in magnificent J.F.K.

","Did what? A sports movie? An epic saga of a football? A Hollywood type of a loosing (at the start) and winning (at the end)?None of above. Since, Stone is unconventional director, with his genius storytelling (not to mention editing, camera movements), he always tends to find the ultimate truth. That's why, he may not be very popular among many Americans, who believe that they live in the greatest country in the world. He showed them corrupted politics (J.F.K., 10 out of 10), puritanism (People Vs. Larry Flint, 9 out of 10), truth about Vietnam (Born on the Fourth of July, 10 out of 10). And now he touched the first U.S. sport. Football. And how? He created another masterpiece with adrenaline camera movement and picture editing, mixed with 'heart-beat-pumping-music'. If this movie were made by any other director, we wouldn't see background. Drugs, sex, prostitution, sedatives, corruption and other. And of course, it's all about money.

","Why?Gangs of New York is an epic movie. With a great scenery and a great leading actor (Daniel Day-Lewis). But, sadly, it fails in any other 'cinema elements'. I was a little sceptic about DiCaprio and Diaz. And boy, was I right. After a successful act in 'Catch me if you can' DiCaprio just didn't manage to cope with a tougher role of Irish emigrant. Maybe Brad Pitt could done this one better. What about Diaz? Great in 'The mask' or 'There's something about Mary', but as an Irish girl? She didn't convinced me. Nicole Kidman at her place, perhaps. Scorsese may be one of the greatest active U.S. directors, but he should stick with 'Goodfellas' instead of making history movies. Leave that to Stone, who proved his masterhood in 'J.F.K' or 'Born on the fourth o July', if you want.

Born on the Fourth of July," OUTSTANDING COURAGEOUS WAR MOVIE
","Well Done, Oliver Stone.With this movie you proved that you're one of the greatest US directors. Ever.A lot of credit goes here to Cruise too, though we must not forget others. They all did excellent job and really show us who don't live in the States, the stupidity of Vietnam war and the courage of Vietnam vets, who suffered and were so humiliated after their return to their 'so called' democratic country. It takes a lot of courage to be Ron Kovic. But it takes even more courage to make a movie, which puts on test your country.
This movie has also something what other's don't. A superb music theme, which makes it even more emotional.Once again the Stone showed us all, that US is far away by being 'the greatest country in the world'. It just a country like any other. With its corrupted politics who makes mistakes and some great people, who are courageous enough to fight against the system (remember JFK).All in all, this movie has opened my eyes when i first saw it at 13. And now, after i have seen it again, it still shocks me. Deserved 10 out of 10.",10,1,4,29 December 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," THE BEST INDY...
","...hmmm, why? It's got all the parts that make it immortal. Great starting scene with young Indy (River Phoenix), colleague scene in N.Y., romantic scenes with a beautiful opponent in Venice (Alison Doody), interesting and funny scene in Austria & Germany (incl. hilarious 'Hitler scene'), magnificent zeppelin and for the final outstanding Alexandreta ending. Add Sean Connery style of acting, John Williams music soundtrack, breath taking action scenes and you got a winner. It's very rarely that sequel beats the original. And this one beats it with a great advantage. Far best story, actors, humorous scenes, the  most beautiful Indy girl,...All I can say is...Since this is the best part I can't imagine a sequel that could beat it. Heh, I guess that this is the price of imortality.10 out of 10",10,0,0,18 March 2002
Back to the Future," A TIMELESS CLASSIC!
","Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis and Alan Silvestri (music). Can just anything go wrong here? Hardly. This trio combined a great story in a timeless classic, full of humor, great charismatic acting from Michael J. Fox (undoubtfully his best performance. Ever.), not forgetting others, especially good-looking Lea Thompson aka young Marty's mother.  Back to the future is one of the best movies made in 80's and certainly, the best movie dealing with time traveling. What just reminds me of a poor production that Hollywood offers us these days (Time machine, 2 out of 10). Plus, it's one of the movies, you never get bored watching it again and again. That's why a strong9 out of 10.",9,0,1,22 September 2002
High Fidelity," PLEASE RATHER READ THE BOOK!!!
","Why?Well, firstly, it's one of the the best books in modern era. Like a Selinger's 'Catcher in the rye' for the 60's generation. And, secondly, you'll see, what could a more capable director did with this movie. No offence, Stephen.Since I read the book before the movie, I certainly expected more funny scenes (for instance, when the main character goes to the movies with his parents and how he comments this event) and maybe a stronger dramatization. I'm not even to sure, if I would put John Cusack for a lead role. While others, especially the guys who worked with him, were much more appropriate.On the other hand, there is a scene (you know, the one with alternate ending, with 'aircondition fight scene') who laughs my pants out. But, sadly, this was the only thing that was above average in this movie. Otherwise it was just as I was watching the Sex and the city episode, only from a man point of view.3 out of 10",3,0,1,29 December 2001
