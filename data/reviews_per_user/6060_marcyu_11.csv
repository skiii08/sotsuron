10 Cloverfield Lane," So Stupidly Awful
","DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is one of the worst ones I have seen in years. Stupid premise, stupid plot, stupid characters, stupid EVERYTHING. This is 45 minutes of my life I will never get back (thanks to the magic of the fast forward function).PLOT - 2; Only the last 10 minutes saved this movie from getting a 1/10.CHARACTERS - 3; The setup was weird and the way they started developing was even more odd.ACTION - 1; The last 10 minutes were the only action scenes of the ENTIRE MOVIE.Please don't waste your time.",2,1,5,21 June 2016
Memento," Not What You'd Expect
","I found this film to be very well made.  This movie is about an insurance claims agent who loses his short term memory, which he believes he can regain by avenging the death of his dead wife.  This is one of those films that goes from the end of the story to the beginning.It wasn't confusing to follow the timelines as they merged to the climax, but it's not a film you really enjoy throughout.  That's probably my only criticism of this film:  you can't enjoy it until the very end.Most of the time, you're sitting trying to fit the pieces together.  And do not be fooled by the beginning of the film.  I thought I had it figured it in the first 10 minutes, but the ending is absolutely impossible to guess. The editing on this film was near flawless.If you want a film that will intrigue and challenge you, this is it.  If you're looking to just relax and watch a no-brainer, save this for another time.",10,0,1,2 December 2001
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Too Raunchy
","I liked 40-Year-Old Virgin a lot, even though Steve Carrell is usually a bit too odd for me. And Knocked Up was one of my favorites of that year, in spite of those crazy sex scenes. But this movie really pushes the envelope too far. To be fair, the funny moments in this movie were very good, and it was thoroughly enjoyable during those times. However, the balance of romance and gross overboard nastiness was not well-balanced this time, in my opinion. I think that most good movies are kept from being great by editing too much of it away. In the case of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the director, Nicholas Stoller, could probably have used Apatow's eye in the cutting room.",4,3,7,28 January 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," A Libby's Wet Dream Come True
","This movie is a liberal's wet dream come true. I especially liked the part where the Americans become the illegal immigrants. I almost died laughing. Include that with the greenhouse effect, the next ice age, Bush/Cheney bashing, SEC hunted stockbrokers, and third world countries, and you have the exact formula needed to have a Federal Election Commission ruling to make the viewing of this movie illegal in the United States during a general election year (the Bush administration actually tried the same thing with Fahrenheit 9/11). Would've been a much better movie if they actually stuck with the story's world viewpoint instead of focusing on a small select group and the politicians involved.",6,1,2,13 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Mixed Review
","I would give it a 7.5 out of 10, if it existed.  I rounded down to 7 due to Lucas' inability to direct any type of on-screen romance.  The audience, which was applauding even before the movie began, groaned when the 'romantic' scenes were playing.  They were too slow, too contrived, and visually awkward.  Clearly, not his strong point - unfortunate due to the sheer volume of these scenes.  The action scenes were quite excellent.  And Yoda - well, you'll see.  Kudos for the action scenes.  Thank goodness we didn't have another intergalactic C-Span for a movie.  The local Washington Post reviewer here said the movie lacked a plot.  This is why almost everyone I know ignores the Washington Post reviewers.  Plot and intrigue galore.  And here's hoping Lucas somehow finds the humility to ask his good friend Steven Spielberg to direct the last of the prequel series. Spider-Man was a better movie.",7,0,0,16 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Overhyped
","Just saw this movie at 12:00 a.m. with a bunch of friends.  The movie attempts to, and almost accomplishes, its goal of matching the book. Therein lies its weakness.  I found the movie much too slow with too few action sequences to justify 3 hours of playing time.  A cinema event should give us an experience that makes us hold our breaths.  The special effects were tremendous, something which did have me at the edge of my seat. However, as I stated before, the plot advancement seemed to crawl at times; in rare cases, it virtually stopped as it attempted the develop characters - something it failed to do at the expense of the storyline.  Because of the pace of the story, I am giving it the following rating: 
6 out of 10",7,0,0,19 December 2001
Disturbia," Just Plain Awful
","DO NOT watch this film. If you watch it, you'll wonder why you didn't listen to good, free advice.The clich√©s are tired, the setup for the premise of the movie was wholly unnecessary, and the writing left everything to be desired by movie's end.I'm uncertain how this movie earned this high rating. Movie plot is painfully predictable, some of the scenes defy reality, and the Asian character was overly stereotyped.There's hardly anything redeeming about this film. I'll never get back the 2 hours this joke for a movie took from me.",4,1,4,12 August 2007
Collateral," Pretty Awful
","More style than substance. And pretty badly styled. I didn't mind that Cruise was cast against type. I really liked Jamie Foxx. And how can you not love Jada Pinkett Smith? But the script was almost unusable from a reality point of view. Do NOT trust these hugely overinflated IMDb ratings that this movie received. I can't see how anyone could really like this movie. It doesn't leave you with anything but a bunch of loose ends and unfulfilled dreams. Highly NOT recommended. Not even a good rental. Don't waste your time and money unless you really feel like watching a movie with weird characters, a bad plot, and awful action scenes.",2,6,10,19 December 2004
Resident Evil," Much Better Than Expected
","I thought this might be one of those brainless action movies that I'm used to watching.  Having this be one of the 'video game' films didn't make me expect much.  What a surprise!  The writing is excellent, especially for a movie of this genre (horror action).  The acting was a tad cheesy with a couple of the supporting cast, but overall, the acting was good.  Whoever wrote the screenplay for this should get an award for doing an unbelievable job with material that could have easily become bad.  The editing with the flashbacks made this movie a pleasure to watch.  Well, lots of gore, too, but it was partly a horror film.  Don't sell this flick short - you'll be in for a pleasant shock.",8,0,1,23 August 2002
Wimbledon," Funny yet Flawed
","Writers in Hollywood still do understand the fact that one night stands are not the norm for today's society. The best comedies, romantic or otherwise, are the ones whose premise, mannerisms, or anecdotes find humor in real everyday life. I found Dunst's performance to be not very believable, but, she has a good range of emotions, which she displays well in this movie. The real star of this movie, however, is Bettany. I've found his acting to always be extraordinary. His breadth in the acting craft is almost without parallel. A Knight's Tale was the first movie to really showcase his abilities, and he has yet to falter in any vehicle after that. Still, neither of these actors can save this shortened movie. Perhaps it should not have been edited down the the result that you see on the screen.",6,1,2,22 September 2004
8 Mile," Never Seen Eminem Before This
","There appears to be a polarization between those who love Eminem and those who hate him.  Since I've never seen him before this movie nor have I ever heard one of his songs before, I'll try to give my impartial impressions.Another disclaimer - I don't listen to rap and The Sound of Music is one of my top movies of all time.  That being said, I liked this movie.  I enjoyed the way Mekhi Phifer and Kim Basinger played their roles.  Both were top notch.  I thought Eminem did a fine job for his debut, although he was basically playing himself.The backdrop was done superbly.  Having grown up near trailer parks, I think the movie captured their gritty reality.  I especially loved the parts where they had to bum rides and go on buses because their car wouldn't work. Make no mistake, this is how poor live in this country.I also liked how gunplay was kept in its proper perspective.  Guns are dangerous and should not be played with, and I think the movie showed how most people react to them in real life.  Of course, the way the movie was written, I think it was intentionally attempting to alleviate the anti-homosexual and sexist remarks Eminem had made a little while back (in fact, this is the only thing I ever heard about Eminem before this movie).The editing was excellent and smooth, and I enjoyed some of the scenes that were tossed in purely for the cheap laughs.  Hey, I like to enjoy a movie! The director obviously did a great job.  Overall, 7 out of 10.  Quite enjoyable - would've rated higher if that gratuitous sex scene wasn't in there.-Marc",9,0,0,28 November 2002
