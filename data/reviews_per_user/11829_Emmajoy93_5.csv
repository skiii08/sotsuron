Casablanca," Casablanca amazing piece of American film
","Casablanca was an amazing piece of film, and has become such a great classic. It was some very famous scenes, and lines, that I have actually heard from people or television shows or movies mimicking Casablanca before I even saw the movie. Such as ' Here's looking at you kid.' And the famous line at the end that Bogart tells Ingrid to get her on the plane. The song 'As Times Goes By,' became very well known I think because of Casablanca. Casablanca had such a cultural significance because it was filmed during World War II, there were many people who went to Bogart's restaurant for his help to get them out of Casablanca so that they could live, because the Nazi's were starting to invade it. Casablanca was a classic romance in which Ingrid tried to chose between to loves of her life but knows she can not stay in Casablanca or she will do, so Bogart tells her to leave in that famous scene at the end and risks getting killed himself for shooting one of the Nazis. This film is very enjoyable, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has not seen it.",10,1,3,3 May 2016
Annie Hall," Woody Allen favorite comedian
","Woody Allen is one of my favorite comedians, so pretty much anything he does or is in I really enjoy. But I remember watching Annie Hall with my dad when I was younger and laughing pretty hard at some of it. The great thing about Annie Hall with Diane Keaton, who is also a really great actor, and her and Woody Allen play great off each other, is that this movie broke the invisibility gap in films that no other films have ever tried before. For example in the very beginning we see Woody Allen talking directly to the camera as if he is talking to us, the audience. Where he also says one of my favorite lines from Charlie Chapman, ' I wouldn't want to be part of any club that would have me as a member.' Which is kind of like Woody Allen's motto in life. Another example is that they used two different split screen shots in the film, Allen added subtitles in the movie at one point, and he even had a cartoon version of himself in the movie.",10,0,0,6 May 2016
The Graduate," Great use of cinematography
","This was a really great film because of all the work the cinematographer put into making this film something special. Something different for the audience. He used many different camera angles and techniques in this movie. For example when we see from Dustin Hoffmans point of view when he is in all the scuba gear and we see what we sees underwater while he is diving in the pool. They used different match cuts in this film and some reverse shots. And dissolve shots of Mrs. Robinson. I like how they used Simon and Garfunkel songs throughout the whole movie, I thought that was different than other movies. But the song Mrs.Robinson is a little different in the movie than on the radio. I think the movie really made that song popular. And I think Simon and Garfunkel became pretty popular to my generation because of The Graduate. I thought Dustin Hoffman was perfect playing the kind of awkward college graduate not sure what to do next.",9,1,1,6 May 2016
Singin' in the Rain," Amazing piece of film
","I used to not really like musicals, but this movie seemed so different than the other musicals. This movie was so wonderfully and had such a great characters and memorable tunes that it was hard to not fall in love with it. The story was well told. Gene Kelly is a truly amazing actor, singer and dancer. The choreography was very enjoyable in the movie. I found myself nonstop smiling while watching this movie. This movie had romance and a little bit of humor. I think a really great part about the movie is how they showed the history, of when the jazz singer came out, which was the first movie with sound and how they could incorporate sound in the movie they were making, to make it a hit. But went through some struggles to get sound on film at first. The scene and the song of Gene Kelly in the street singing is such a memorable scene and an iconic song.",10,0,1,6 May 2016
Pulp Fiction," Very brilliantly shot film
","Pulp fiction is one of the best crime/ dramatic movie of my time. The movie had such a great cast, and some intense dramatic scene pretty much through the whole movie. I remember not liking this movie when I was a kid, but now that I am older I really enjoy watching this film. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie but the most memorable scene I think was when Uma Thurman and John Travolta are dancing on stage at the restaurant to ' You never can tell' by Chuck Berry. Another famous and great scene is Samuel L Jacksons speech hes giving to the guy while shooting every one else. A lot of action shots in this film, drugs, guns, and violence. A very brilliantly shot film.",10,3,6,13 May 2016
