The Legend of Bagger Vance," Sadly, a truly stupid, annoying movie
","I really wanted to like this movie. I'm a keen golfer. More than that, a keen student of the history of golf. And I actually believe many of the things that are said about golf in this film. Unfortunately they are drowned in endless sickening violins, and Will Smith's awful, permanently smirking character. If I had to play a round of golf with a pontificating smirker like that, it would be really all I could do to get round the course without making a serious attempt to do him an injury. There are certainly other nits that could be picked - the rules of golf are not well respected in the presentation, and the movie is rather unfair to Robert Jones and Walter Hagen, who were, after all, real people. But the massively annoying Bagger Vance character and the dreadful syrupy music drowning all significant moments are what really sink the movie. The style of the cinematography somewhat matches the music, but I could have lived with that, if it were not for the other problems. Given the paucity of decent golf movies, I suppose this is worth checking out for those interested in golf and its history, but it really is a bit much to take - muting the sound, especially when Bagger is speaking, might improve it quite a bit (although you'd still have to endure the best part of an hour of that annoying smirk).",2,0,1,12 March 2013
Erin Brockovich," Badly presented 'true story' completely lacks credibility
","There's no way you could fail to be aware that this is a 'well meaning' movie. Unfortunately it's also a badly scripted, sloppily directed movie, which completely destroys its own credibility in the first ten minutes, and then does absolutely nothing to re-establish any credibility for the rest of its excessive length. Let me make myself quite clear here - I'm not commenting whatsoever on the facts of the 'true story' on which this movie is based... that's another issue entirely (but listening to the real Erin Brockovich on the DVD... now I don't claim to know all the facts or anything... but she was sure infinitely more credible than anything in the film itself). The movie doesn't need any facts to refute it - it's so flawed that it thoroughly refutes itself. If you're the kind of person who finds the incoherent and self-contradictory ramblings of drunks on public transit entirely fascinating and believable, then this movie is for you. Everyone else - forget it... unless you really need another reminder of how obscene it is that Julia Roberts is pretty close to being the highest paid actor on the planet (not that she can't act - she can, up to a point... she's just nowhere near that good). And just in case you saw the trailers and the posters and were wondering - no Ms. Roberts' stunt mammaries are not enough to save the picture.",Null,0,4,15 August 2000
Star Trek," Very Disappointing
","I must say I was very, very disappointed by this movie. I had read a lot of critical praise for it, and not seen much in the way of negative comment, so I expected it to be a least fairly good. Unfortunately this was not so. Frankly it seemed to me mostly a load of distasteful sensationalism, that did nothing but harm to the Star Trek vision. Of course it has plenty of fancy special effects - although they do seem to lean heavily towards a lot of flashing coloured swirls. And the acting is thoroughly professional - given the script, I don't think the actors can be faulted at all. They do excellent work with what's available to them. But the whole direction seems a complete disaster to me. Really I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised or disappointed. This is entirely consistent with Abrams' previous performance. I have to admit I've found all his previous output pretty much intolerable, with the possible exception of parts of Felicity. But I don't really have any emotional investment in, for example, Mission Impossible, so I didn't much care if he made a mess of that - other than the fact that film was just extremely unpleasant, and generally a negative contribution to the human race. I care more about this, because I really do think that Star Trek was worth saving from being reduced to this kind of nasty trash. Ah well, nothing is safe in this universe. As Spock might say, we must try to avoid emotional involvement, and rationally all we can do is try our best to encourage positive alternatives. As a final note, though, I truly am shocked that this movie didn't get much more negative response, especially from fans of the real Star Trek (fairly multifarious though that may be... but I certainly wouldn't include this unpleasant misbirth).",2,6,11,21 November 2009
Yes Man," No, no, no, no
","Let's not mince words - this movie is completely worthless, worse than awful, appalling. Every minute that anyone, anywhere spends watching this utter rubbish diminishes the human race. Try as I might, I cannot see anything positive likely to arise for anyone from watching this. Why was it made? Presumably to raise money, to attempt to revive Jim Carrey's career... surely not out of anything resembling artistic vision, let alone inspiration. It's not offensive or anything... just desperate, dismal, and dispiritingly rancid. You could, I'm pretty sure, find more enjoyment and enlightenment by going out onto a busy street and inviting strangers to insult you - at least you wouldn't have to pay them, and you might possibly hear something useful or amusing, which is more than you will get by paying to see this movie.",1,5,13,17 May 2009
Event Horizon," What an annoying movie!
","What an annoying movie! You've got a bunch of pseudo-scientific bafflegab. You've got a bunch of weird dream and hallucination sequences. You've got a bunch of people acting in all sorts of odd ways, but dominantly ill-tempered and unreasonable. And then the pseudo-scientific bafflegab progressively slides into pseudo-religious bafflegab about 'evil', and the whole sorry mess sort of morphs into some kind of horror film. I don't know! The production values are all excellent - acting talent, special effects, editing... but it all seems so pointless, and thoroughly unpleasant to watch as well. And if you hang on expecting it all to make some sense... well 'don't' is all I can say. Event Horizon also must break records for gratuitous use of graphic displays of human mutilation... and all in the service of a script that goes nowhere, and burdens itself with too much gobbledegook to work on a level of simple story telling.",Null,0,1,23 September 2000
The Dark Knight," What a stupid, annoying load of rubbish
","How could this movie possibly have received so much acclaim? OK, it's competently executed, both in terms of acting and production values - but then with the money spent on it, hopefully that should be taken for granted. And certainly it has some fine actors in it, and they give every impression of fully believing in their work. But what the heck is the point of it supposed to be? I'm sorry, but I just absolutely hated it. It reminds me of a local case in the press here in Toronto a while ago where some 'art student' made a movie of a cat being tortured to death. Since he actually tortured a cat to death to make it, he was charged and prosecuted, and his defence was that it was 'art'. Well... at least all the people tortured and killed in this movie presumably were only faking it and weren't actually hurt. But I still don't think it has any more claim to be worthwhile or to be art. It's obnoxious rubbish... and I strongly suggest that if you haven't seen it and are considering doing so, you think of some better use for your time (which would be pretty much anything not actually harmful to your health or anybody else's).",1,16,31,23 November 2008
Enemy at the Gates," Powerful war drama, but not always believable, and with horrible music
","I have rather mixed feelings about this film. First the good - the central performances range from solid to excellent, and the evocation of the terrible reality of the wartime situation is powerfully and compellingly done. So, for these reasons, I'd probably recommend the movie to most people. Also it has an effective narrative drive, and the story and characters keep the viewer engaged to the end. But... there are some major problems. For me, the most significant was the score - the music is truly terrible, and does a great deal to ruin the film. If there were an option to simply turn off all the music this would improve the film immeasurably. The constant, intrusive, overbearing, syrupy, pseudo-symphonic accompaniment is utterly at odds with the visual and dramatic content. It's hard to comprehend how a director who could make so many good decisions could make such an awful one - perhaps he simply has a tin ear. There are other problems also... one's suspension of disbelief is frequently challenged. The script seems to have got carried away by a desire to tell a heroic story, and yet it consistently contains within it enough reality to persistently remind the viewer of the unlikeliness of that story. It's like a propagandist who wavers between believing his own output and dealing with the truth around him. And perhaps that post-modern wavering is intended (but I rather doubt it... on the evidence of the film itself, and on the evidence of the accompanying DVD material, which gives no hint of such deliberate sophistication). There are also more mundane problems - the technical portrayal of the performance of snipers is ludicrous (they can hit pinpoint targets, sometimes moving, hundreds of yards away, 100% of the time, sometimes whilst scanning a wide area with only a split-second revelation of the actual target). And the 'Hollywood ending' is clearly totally out of place.",Null,1,2,14 March 2003
Bram Stoker's Dracula," What a load of cheesy twaddle!
","Wow... what a load of cheesy twaddle! How could a bunch of people many of whom have shown considerable talent over their careers have managed to perpetrate this? Or were they trying to make a comedy or spoof of some sort? I really don't think so. The standout turn has to be Keanu Reeves' ludicrous attempt at playing a refined Englishman... but really hardly anyone comes out of this looking good. And the golden turkey has to go to Coppola himself for guiding this mess. What WAS he thinking? The most successful efforts are around the periphery... for example Richard Grant as Dr. Jack Seward manages to deliver a performance of which he need not be ashamed, which in the midst of this farrago is quite a testament. To be avoided, unless you really crave seeing a bunch of mostly very talented people struggling in something laughably bad.",Null,1,2,1 October 2000
The Matrix," Makes no sense and is unbearably pretentious - why is it so popular?
","Well... I guess I have to buck a trend here. Apparently everyone liked the Matrix... heck, apparently even Pauline Kael thought it was good. I thought it stank. There were two broad reasons I disliked the film. Firstly - it made absolutely no sense! I can't really go into details here without revealing too much... but watch the movie and pay attention... listen to what characters say and watch what happens - it makes *no* darned sense at all! Now I could have forgiven that, if it weren't for the second problem - The Matrix is unbelievably overbearing and pretentious! Everything about it is falsely heavy and pretentious - the art design, the direction, the acting (well... presumably because of the direction)... if I had to choose, I'd say the cinematography bugged me the most - vapid and overbearing in the extreme. Since the movie seems to be intent on hammering the audience into the ground with its own self-importance but makes no sense whatsoever... it really completely baffles me why so many people liked it. Now... if you want to see a worthwhile, intelligent movie on the same basic theme, see The Thirteenth Floor... a vastly superior film in almost every way (although it has far less in the way of gunshots, explosions and general noisiness).",Null,0,0,8 August 2000
Gladiator," Dour, heavy-handed, depressing, unpleasant.
","I hated this movie. It's all fighting, and heavy-handed, tendentious plotting that's telegraphed way in advance, and murdering and torturing etc... depressing as hell, and made worse by being constantly accompanied by bad pseudo-Bruckner music. I really can't understand at all why anybody would want to expend their effort making a movie like this or wreck hours of their time watching it (I certainly wish I hadn't). It's technically competent, sure, and doubtless cost lots of money and shows it... but the whole exercise just seemed utterly depressing and futile to me. I hated Thelma And Louise and G.I. Jane too. I guess I've pretty much given up on Ridley Scott... although I liked his earlier films, particularly Blade Runner.",1,1,9,30 June 2001
