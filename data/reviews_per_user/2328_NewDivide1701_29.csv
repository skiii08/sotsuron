Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," All in the name.
","Only because of the name Star Wars is what kept the Phantom Menace from flopping in the first place. And only because it was the first Star Wars movie in 16 years is what allowed it to be the top movie in 1999.The story involves the peaceful world of Naboo being invaded by the greedy Trade Federation, and the first meeting of a 9 year old Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, when he was only a Jedi trainee, or what they call a padawan. This movie is suppose to have started the whole Star Wars saga. But unfortunately the prequel is too heavily reliant on the original trilogy and probably the most forgettable Star Wars installment.As with all Star Wars films, the visual effects are incredible. And special commendations for the incredible alien species shown, excluding Jar Jar Binks of course. The pod racing scene not only meets, but exceeds expectations. But outside of the visual effects, the pod racing scene, the costumes, and the sets, this movie has very little to offer.Even with a battle sequence near the beginning, the movie is pretty slow and lame. Its level of interest however rockets at the pod race scene, but then it drops after that. And it only inches its way back up at the climax.The climax of the movie has 3 battle scenes. On the planet of Naboo, the star-fighter sequence in orbit, and the Jedi lightsabre sequence. Out of all those 3, the Jedi scene barely meets expectation. The other 2 are disappointing, despite the special effects.If the Phantom Menace were to have been released before the original Star Wars, the Star Wars saga would never have taken off. Never have even reached episode 2. If they learned anything from Star Trek, pretty soon, not even the name Star Wars will save the next film, if there were a 7th. And Star Wars will crash a lot sooner than Star Trek.",4,2,4,29 October 2005
Star Trek," The future has a new lease
","As Captain Picard once said, 'Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown'.One of the many great things about this movie is not only it has the concept of 'This is not your father's Star Trek', while still being 'your father's Star Trek'. In short, J.J. Abrams' Star Trek is not a reboot, but the same old Star Trek pushed into unknown territory.The movie is not one big homage to the original series, but flows with not only the original series, but the entire legacy as well. And as any good Star Trek film, or any good sequel/prequel/instalment, you don't need to know any of the other movies to understand it. What is even better that even with the alterations to the time line, much of what is known about Star Trek's legacy is still maintained, including the Kobyashi Maru scenario for example.From a Trekkies point of view, that even the course of Star Trek history has been drastically changed, it doesn't have the 'screw the original series' feel, but rather that we are now boldly going where no one has gone before, and what is to happen with Star Trek with these drastic historic changes. Sailing into the unknown.Star Trek blends comedy, suspense and action perfectly, though it hardly give you time to breathe. Basically, the one scene from The Last Samurai where Tom Cruise took out 3 assassins at once and later the events caught up with him. This is the feeling you get from this movie at the end where it all finally comes together. With all that, it also has the same fantastic feel as did the original Star Trek did, making the old seem new again, and not betraying Star Trek at all.The Enterprise I admit was a shock to see, but quickly came to accept it as the Enterprise, keeping it true to Walter 'Matt' Jeffries original design, while re-envisioning the look of the 23rd century and keeping it true to Star Trek legacy. The design of the bridge, transporter room, everything, as though the designers have the technology to extract imagination directly out of imagination itself.Onto the characters. Chris Pine's portrayal of James Tiberius Kirk (why he left it as James T.) is shown a someone who is very impulsive, cocky, and ready to use his fists, while at the same time showing his light hearted side and that sense of apprehension. In other words, exactly like James T. Kirk. He does not portray him as William Shatner did, but that would be more like a parody as shown many times over.The case of the 2 Spock's, their performances are, I wouldn't say identical, rather they are almost indistinguishable from each other. Both Zachary Quinto who does a nice performance of the same old Spock we all know and love, and Leonard Nimoy able to go back to his famous role after 18 years.Probably the best performance is Karl Urban as Doctor Leonard McCoy where he is not doing an impression of Deforest Kelley as McCoy, but that his performance is almost a dead ringer for that of Deforest.Where in many science fiction stories where people are looking for survivors of a starship, planet, or apocalypse, this movie now can take a new approach of survivors of time. What path will they follow? Will this Star Trek be something completely new, or will it settle into much of what was your father's Star Trek?And I had no trouble with the lens flare. It added character to the movie.Altogether, this is by far the best Star Trek I have ever seen, and recommend it to both the fans and the non-fans. And I am willing to see where this will lead. And go into territory ... he he, where no one has gone before.Give Star Trek ..... 10/10",10,2,4,21 February 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Jack Sparrow is no Superman
","Bottom line. If you are only able to watch one movie during the summer of 2006, your best bet is Superman.In the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Dead Man's Chest's position can be summed up in 2 words. Matrix Reloaded. Not just in its overratedness, but in its premise as well.Dead Man's Chest begins with a poorly portrayed villainous Lord who wants Jack Sparrows compass, and coercers Will Turner to retrieve it for him. This then leads the crew of the pirate ship Black Pearl on an adventure to face off Davy Jones, captain of the feared ghost ship Flying Dutchman. Which will lead us to a trilogy for the fate of Jack Sparrow, the destiny of Will Turner, and the fate of the crew of the Black Pearl.Johnny Depp does an excellent job of restoring Jack Sparrow, captain of the Black Pearl, who is also the comedy relief. And wouldn't be surprised if another Oscar is nominated for him. The other cast members including Kira Knightly and Orlando Bloom also revive their characters just as well.The movie during the first half of the movie is really fun, warranting a 9/10. Extremely funny, adventurous, and action packed. Defiantely worth seeing. But then, the movie takes a turn for the worst during the second half for when the real adventure starts during the second half, it starts to wind down. Where suspense and pace seriously starts to become lax, to the point where the gags start to become less effective.In comparison, it doesn't even come close to being as good as The Curse of the Black Pearl. Started out with an incredible movie, now it's starting to ripen.Now what does this mean for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise? Will it follow the footsteps of Lord of the Rings and Superman? Where it starts out with an incredible first movie, the sequel or series of sequels becomes lax, and then returns with an incredible latest installment or trilogy? Or will it follow the footsteps of Robocop, the Matrix, and Star Wars? Where they start off with one great film, and then the subsequent sequels/prequels just get worse and worse and worse? Only time will tell with the release of Pirates 3.Give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest ..... 6.5 out of 10.And the point five is being kind to the Pirates fans.",6,2,4,16 July 2006
Brokeback Mountain," A truly moving movie of forbidden love.
","Definitely a truly moving movie about forbidden love.This movie does and excellent job at portraying 2 men who fall in love with each other, and having to face a cruel world that isn't open to them. And even with their attempts to regain 'normal' lives after their encounter at Brokeback Mountain, they always go back to each other when they felt true love.There is a reason why Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger were nominated for their performances, acting performance that is. They truly brought forth their characters. Ennis's (Ledger) reluctance and denial of his feelings, and Jack's (Gyllenhaal) willingness to be with his true love.And Ang Lee definitely deserves the Oscar for bringing forth love, betrayal and heartbreak to the screen. Especially the heartbreak that really brought forth the full emotion of the movie.Obviously the gay sex scenes would be too much for people who are very squeamish about the subject (dropping it from a 9 out of 10), but the rest of the movie is irresistible.No doubt as to why this movie was nominated for best picture, give Brokeback Mountain ...... 8.5 out of 10.",8,12,13,22 May 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," This movie froze up.
","This disaster movie is a complete disaster itself. A movie about a sudden ice age, and it completely froze up. Half way through the movie, and you'd be falling asleep. The science of the movie for is suppose to help support the movie's story, and yet the science was the only real interesting part of the movie.Day After Tomorrow is more than worthy of numerous Raspberry nominations. The visual effects were surprisingly unimpressive. Neither the sets. And it's lacking of a plot didn't help either. Even if they added a cemetery plot would have helped the movie.About the critical dangers of global warming, and this movie only adds to the pollution in our atmosphere. Completely uninspiring.Give Day After Tomorrow .... 0 out of 10",1,4,9,7 May 2006
Spider-Man 3," The web slinger meets expectations.
","The basics of Spiderman 3 is Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) fighting 3 villains, specifically Venom (Topher Grace), the new Green Goblin (James Franco) and Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) while both struggling with his darker side in an alien enhanced costume, and fighting for the love of Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). All wrapped up in a complex, segmented story with awe inspiring visual effects. And wouldn't be surprised if Oscar nods comes to Spiderman 3 as with Spiderman 2's Oscar win for best visual effects.One of the basic components of the movie is Peter Parker struggling with his dark side, which is augmented by an alien symbiont that increased and feeds off of his aggression and hate. But the 'where does the costume end and the man begins' concept started before the alien even joined with Peter when he was allowing Spiderman to control his life, that also interfered with his relationship with Mary Jane Watson.One of the downsides of the movie is that it needs more story support, in other words additional back stories and details to silence the critics. Due to its overall complexity. But in order to do that, they needed to extend the movie's story so much, they would have to have either made Spiderman 3 a 4 hour long movie, or even longer, or split Spiderman 3 into Spiderman's 3 and 4 to effectively tell the complex story.Even though an extra hour's worth of story telling would have given Spiderman 3 additional support, the 'short' 2-1/2 hours did a fine job in getting the basics. Not as good as Lord of the Rings, but much better than X-men: Last Stand, which desperately needed the additional stories to have kept it from sucking.It even helped with the intro that did a 'fast forward' of the first 2 movies to get the audiences up to speed as to what happened in the first 2.Give the first Spiderman ..... 9/10 Spiderman 2 ..... 10/10 And finally give Spiderman 3 ..... 8.10",8,0,2,10 May 2007
Silent Hill," Where Silence Has Lease
","Rose Da Silva, a loving mother taking her daughter Sharon to the forbidden town of Silent Hill, to help her with her nightmares. Yet when she enters, she enters a world between worlds. Between the real world and hell.This is a genuine suspense thriller, not only to search for her daughter who has gone missing in that literal ghost town, but also finding clues to the town's sinister history. Albeit it's history is 'typical,' it's still well portrayed. And so re-watchable, getting it on DVD would still leave you with that suspenseful feel.This movie is suspenseful enough to keep you wondering what is going to happen next. Well written and well acted to keep you glued to your seats. It wasn't exactly frightening (reduced rating from 9), but it was very unnerving to watch all the horror that is happening around Rose and Officer Bennett while they try to search for Rose's lost daughter and find a way out of silent hill. Not only to the horrors from the demons of darkness, but to why Silent Hill is so forbidden.And with an ending that still leaves you in wonder.Give Silent Hill .... 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,1,30 April 2006
The Bodyguard," Meant to be heard, not watched
","One of the greatest soundtracks of all time linked to one of the lamest movies of all time.The entire premise of the movie is a bodyguard, played by Kevin Costner, out to protect a rock singer, played by Whitney Houston, and the 2 fall in love. But outside of that, there is no story. No plot. Nothing to make it watchable.However, its soundtrack is still one of the best soundtracks to date. Especially with one of the best love songs of all time, 'I will always love you.' In fact without the soundtrack, the movie would have died on its first weekend. The song is the whole premise of the movie 'The Bodyguard,' while the movie itself is 2 hours of aimless garbage.Without the soundtrack, the Bodyguard is at best zero out of ten. But even with the soundtrack, it still rounds out to a disappointing 2 out of 10.",2,10,18,1 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The beginning of the end.
","For in many ways, the Return of the Jedi signifies both beginnings and endings.For it concludes the story of Anakin Skywalker, the end of a saga, and the end of Star Wars being good. And still brings forth a new beginning, a beginning of cheesiness to Star Wars. Starting with this movie, Star Wars takes a turn for the worse in terms of overall development.The movie starts out with the rescue of Han Solo from the clutches of Jaba the Hutt. Then to the battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, and the Rebel Alliance's mission to destroy an even more powerful Death Star, this time with no way to stop it.Although the visual effects were still really good, the story and pace started to become weak. The integration from the rescue of Han Solo to destroying the Death Star 2 were far from seamless. And the rescue of Han Solo seemed far less effective than the rescue of Spock from 'Star Trek 3: The Search for Spock.' Felt more like an excuse to bring back Solo.Both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi reveals something about Luke Skywalker's heritage and family. Though Empire Strikes Back's revelation still ripples through pop culture today, revealing the 'other' in this movie that Yoda mention in Empire was pretty lame, and felt a little pointless. And that fact of the 'other' didn't really have a role except in the Star Wars comic book series 'Dark Empire.' Basically, starting with this movie, Star Wars began to run out of steam. And that loss of steam continued on with the disappointing prequels.However, the movie is not totally faulty. A tad cheesy, bringing forth the lovable Ewoks was a nice touch. It's development was pretty lame, but the final battle between Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, and the Emperor did play a pivotal role in the Star Wars universe.Being reasonably good as a general movie, but still pretty cheesy over all, give Return of the JedI 6.5 out of 10.",6,1,3,18 March 2006
Scary Movie 2," Better than the first
","It's still gross, but it was better than the first Scary Movie.Scary Movie 2 parodies the teens in a haunted house type movies. But it still had many of the failing of the first Scary Movie. By taking a scene known to movie goers and parodying it and integrating it into the movie with almost no success. But in a limited sense, it does seem to have a plot to it.The gags range from funny or funny/sick to pointless/impotent, most of them in the middle of those ranges, and leaning towards the pointless/impotent side.Only good as a goofy rental, it still is better than the first one.Give Scary Movie 2, 3.5 out of 10.",1,2,3,15 February 2006
Taxi Driver," Taxi, get me out of here.
","What Martin Scorsese did to Taxi Driver is what Hurricane Katrina did to New Orleans.There are 2 types of Scorsese movies. Great stories wrecked by Scorsese; like Casino, and awful movies made worse by Scorsese; like Aviator. So where does Taxi Driver fall? Right along side with Casino, an intriguing story and characters ruined by an incompetent Martin Scorsese. The story revolves around a man (Robert DeNiro) who takes a job as a taxi driver, and wants to get his life organized, finally does so when he meets a teen prostitute (Jodie Foster), and wants to help her regain her life.Robert DeNiro's performance and character he plays is definitely inspirational, along with his line 'You talking to me?', which this movie is credited for starting.But even great stories with great actors can still fail miserably due to lousy presentation cause of a flimsy director, namely Martin Scorsese. He ruined Taxi Driver by making it dull, lame and impotent, as he did with his other films. Out of all the directors, like John Carpenter and George Lucas, they normally ruin masterpieces the second time around with remakes, special editions, and prequels/sequels. Scorsese wrecks masterpieces the first time around.The story alone is enough to warrant the movie a 7/10, but the awful directing renders Taxi Driver to 2.5/10. If directed by anyone except Martin Scorsese, then Taxi Driver had a better chance of winning best picture. But with Scorsese, Taxi Driver is thankful that the Razzies didn't appear until the early 1980's.But the character study and story are too much to ignore, and demands a remake without a movie wrecker like Martin Scorsese.",3,14,32,28 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not half bad, the other half was lame.
","Albeit Attack of the Clones was better than the Phantom Menace, it's still fairly disappointing.The movie starts out with an assassination attempt on Senitor Amidala's life. Which leads 2 Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his padewan Anakan Skywalker onto 2 separate story lines.Kenobi investigation on who is trying to murder Amidala leads him to a conspiracy involving the creation of a clone army for the Republic. And to even darker secrets within the heart of the Republic. That was the good half.The other half is a totally pointless attempt to show the growing, forbidden love between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala. As well as the tragic loss that Anakin suffers, which starts to lead him to the path of the dark side of the force. We're better off with Jar Jar Binks.Obi-Wan's half of the movie is intriguing and exciting enough to warrant it a 7 out of 10. But Anakin and Padme's half is so bad, it would not even have a rating. Averaging a 3.5 out of 10.But the climax of the movie was spectacular. The battle between the clone troopers and the droid army, the Jedi fight scenes, and the battle with Anakin, Kenobi, and even Yoda verses Count Dooku. Not only it starts the Clone Wars animated series, but it begins to lead us to episode 4, the original Star Wars.And it's this climax that allows this movie to barely attain a 5 out of 10. Closer to a 4.5 out of 10.However, the overall quality of the Star Wars franchise after the original trilogies is so lousy, that if Star Trek was a dying franchise at the time of the release of the Revenge of the Sith, then the Star Wars franchise was a zombie. Moving, but dead.",5,0,1,29 October 2005
The Aviator," Crashed and burned.
","This has got to be one of the worst movies I had ever seen. Almost 3 hours long, and not even 20 minutes of it is worth watching.There doesn't seem to be any attempt to make Howard Hughes even interesting. Nor any of the other characters as a matter of fact. Most of major ones goes by as 'who the heck are they?' all throughout the movie. Not even the great talents of Alan Alda nor Alec Baldwin could have saved this movie.Instead of showing the struggles, the loves, and the eccentricities of Howard Hughes, it just shows him as a pointless nut-ball. Nothing more than a historical footnote. And that he is portrayed just as apathetic, if not just as pathetic, as Alan Alda's character.Weak characters, poor story line, impotent action. In fact the crash sequence mentioned by the MPAA uses more sophisticated special effects than what was used on Star Trek Generations or Nemesis, and whose budget was more than the 2 movies Star Trek movies combined. But in every way the Aviator's crash sequence was inferior to either one of those 2 crashes.If this movie were to even be nominated for any awards, make it a Rasberry award for worst picture.",1,5,10,18 September 2005
The Shining," Genuine fright-fest
","Defiantely one of the most frightening movies of all time. More than enough to scare the living daylights out of the more legitimate tough guy's.Bringing Stephen King's novel to the big screen is definitely one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest achievements. And totally disagreeing with the 2 raspberry nominations. Oscar nominations is more accurate.Jack Nicholson is remarkable for is transformation from being normal to becoming insane. Despite Shelley Duvall's razzie nomination, she did a good job with her expressions of terror. Even newcomer Danny Lloyd did a great job. Actually, all the acting was excellent.The directing, the camera angles, the score, all successfully mixed together into a truly terrifying atmosphere. Excellent adaptation. If only Kubrick did this to other of King's novels before he died.2001, Dr. Strangelove, the Shining, definitely makes Stanley Kubrick one of the best directors of his time.",9,0,0,12 March 2006
Apocalypse Now," I love the smell of raspberries in the morning.
","Raspberry awards that is.In short, this movie has an unforgettable title, unforgettable PR, yet highly forgettable story.This movie was suppose to be about the journey, and from that first step it got us lost.It only has 2, maybe 3 memorable scenes. Memorable being you actually remember it. The one is Martin Sheen's 'I can't believe they want this man dead.' And that was only memorable when it was parodied by Hot Shots: Part Deux.And there is the scene where Marlon Brando is washing his head. And that is only memorable during a dream sequence from an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.And the infamous quote, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning,' is hardly that inspiring. If at all.It's been said that Apocalypse Now is good, but just slow. There is no such thing as a good slow movie. Any movie that has the ability to grab your attention every step of the way is a good movie no matter how long it is. Apocalypse Now doesn't do that at all. Nothing to grab your attention condemning it a bad movie.All in all, this movie is boring and highly overrated. And you know it's bad, really bad if you only remember those scenes from parodies.",1,21,48,5 December 2005
Transformers," Truly more than meets the eye
","Transformers in short is an excellent sci-fi action adventure of robots with the ability to change, or transform, themselves from earth vehicles into titanic robots who have come to Earth to seek an all powerful artifact known as the all spark, as well as to wage their war on our world.This rehash of the classic 80's cartoons is just as visually inspiring as Transformers the movie back in 1986. This movie is not 'dumbed downed,' but a movie that was made to simply sit back, relax, and enjoy without the need of unnecessary complexity to the story that has on occasions ruined failed epics.Transformers has a significant amount of suspense and tension within it to keep the viewers interested in the movie, while also having well timed comedy to keep the movie from being depressing or too serious. As well it was made to give it the 'it all happened so fast' feel to it, and a sense of being there in the midst of battle. Greatly enhancing the overall effect.If it wasn't for the name Transformers, the incredible visual effects, the high octane action, as well as the story would allow the average person to understand it without any reference points. And the story didn't need to parallel human society, just entertain, and they did their jobs quite well in that department.Give Transformers ..... 8.5/10",9,1,5,14 July 2007
Million Dollar Baby," A real knockout!
","This movie is enjoyable even for those who are not crazy about sports movies. And aside from the fact that the Aviator, it's best picture nominee rival, is crap at best, there is a reason why this movie won the best picture award.Clint Eastwood didn't just make a movie, he made a movie right! And is a blueprint on how to make a great movie. Unlike the Aviator that did everything wrong! Clint is, at worst, excellent in his characters reluctance to train a female boxer, and Hilary Swank is just as charming on her characters hardheadedness and determination. And the chemistry between these 2 actors are incredible when he finally decides to coach and train her, and is maintained all the way to the end. Excellent triumphs and tragedies throughout the movie.Even some witty comebacks that can get you laughing.In fact the only bad thing I can say about this movie is that you can't cook ham on the DVD.",10,4,8,24 October 2005
The Departed," Scorsese never fails .... to disappoint.
","Overall, the Departed can be summed up in 2 words. 'Taxi Driver.' Meaning just like Taxi Driver, The Departed has incredible acting, a powerful story, that had a tonne of potential. But all of it came crashing down when Martin Scorsese directed, almost totally killing the movie. Rendering it boring, lame and impotent.The movie is about an undercover police officer (Leonardo DiCaprio) who infiltrates a crime boss (Jack Nicholson) who is also looking for a corrupt cop (Matt Damon) who works for the crime boss (Nicholson). And the same corrupt cop (Damon) is looking for the undercover cop (DiCaprio).A simple case of hunter vs. hunter with ironically a powerful, yet impotent ending.When it comes to acting, specifically with Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg, and others, they probably would all be competing with each other for the Academy awards for best actor or best supporting actors.If the Departed were directed by anyone else, Quentin Tarantino, Bryan Singer, Michael Mann, Curtis Hanson, then the Departed most likely have limited competition for both best directing and best picture at the Academy Awards.But with Martin Scorsese at the helm, successfully diverting our attention away from the excellent acting and incredible story, he guaranteed himself a well deserved Razzie award for worst director and allowed a worst screenplay Razzie award as well.The brutality and the violence of the movie was very impotent and boring. Though having noticeable amounts of humour, thanks to the excellent acting and stories, they were almost totally overshadowed by the dullness of the movies poor pace, thanks to Scorsese.From the background, one person said that the the movie was confusing. And another said that it became more stressful, but felt like it was going nowheres.But if you can only focus on the story and the acting, the Departed is recommended. Actually, either just read the book or listen to the audio book with the actors doing the voices. But if you have to see the movie as a whole, watch something else, cause the Departed is a waste of time.Future note to Hollywood, let Scorsese set everything up, and leave him out of it after that.For story and acting alone, the Departed is definitely worth a 9/10.But with Martin Scorsese successfully putting in his infamous 'going no wheres fast' feel to the movie, overshadowing everything else, give the departed ....... 2.5 out of 10.",2,12,25,7 October 2006
War of the Worlds," A remake work making.
","The War of the Worlds has been told, and retold in many ways, and all but one variation was very successful. Steven Spielberg's version is one of many that was successful.The variations of War of the Worlds has had an impact on the society that had watched or listened to it. The 1938 radio broadcast for the fear of the rise of the Nazis in Germany. 1953, the fear of communism. Independence Day, using the story as a blueprint society's view of alien visitations, abductions, the Roswell incident, and Area 51. And now 2005 living in the post 9/11 world.Unlike the 1953 version, this version hits us closer to home, where we can relate to the characters much more easily. It isn't a brilliant scientist who tries to save us this time, it's where we see a man trying to save his children from the invaders, as we all would try to do. The incredible acting and character development helps to build the intensity and the drama of the movie, and even several comical moments.The invaders themselves are just as intriguing. Where as all the other versions of the War of the Worlds has us technically know where they came from, like from Mars or outer space in general, the origin of the invaders in this movie is still unknown to us. The primary assumption is that they too are from outer space, but as far as we know, they are from another dimension, or another time. That lack of knowledge and not knowing their motives makes them even scarier and more mysterious.The scene where our heroes are first fleeing from the invaders in the van is incredible. The tripods, excellent. Both mechanical and yet living.A classical story remade by a man who usually knows how to make movies. Once again, Spielberg at his best.",9,0,1,26 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," When the Sith hits the fan.
","Former Hypaspace host Jonathan Llyr stated when he saw the trailer to 'Revenge of the Sith,' he said 'oh my god, it actually looks good.' Unfortunately looks can be deceiving.Revenge of the Sith revolves around the eventual transformation of Anakin Skywalker into the dreaded Darth Vader, with his quest for more power and virtually wiping out the Jedi knights. As well as making a connection between the prequels and the original trilogy, and tying everything up for episode 4, the original Star Wars.As with all Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith brings forth incredible and awe inspiring visual effects and art that almost no one could ever match. And that's about all the real good Revenge of the Sith has.The movie's overall interest level in terms of storyline wavers a fair amount. Ranging from edge of your seat excitement to a considerable snooze fest. Even the battle sequences throughout the movie are not flawless. There are several times when the excitement level dips far below what is expected of Star Wars. Sometimes even too silly for its own good. That include all battles minus the battles at the climax of the movie.Further hampering of the movie is the below average acting skills, to the point where it is very noticeable even consideration for raspberry awards. Also overblown theatrics felt too cliché like and felt like a lame hyperbole. Overused classic Star Wars quotes such as 'I've got a bad feeling about this,' is enough to get on the nerves of average movie goers. And over dramatizing quotes for this movie are not very impressive.There are certain plots that are at tad stupid. This movie is far too dependant on what Star Trek would call non-cannon sources, including the Clone Wars cartoons. For example, General Grievous in the cartoons and comics is just as intimidating and frightful as Darth Vader was in the original Star Wars. But here on the movie, we are introduced to him as a badly damaged cyborg, not much of a threat. Even when he is fully repaired, he doesn't feel that intimidating. And Chewbacha's cameo? And the comedy duo between R2-D2 and C-3P0 are lost.However putting aside the problems with the movie, and aside from its incredible visuals, this movie does remain true to the Star Wars universe. And is the best of the prequels. Including making it fell just as mythological as episodes 4 and 5. And a fair amount of the time the excitement level of the battle sequences does actually meet Star Wars standards, and those are pretty high standards. And this includes the ultimate battle between Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.For the hard core Star Wars fans, it is a major success in restoring the magic of Star Wars. For those are familiar with Star Wars, or who like Star Wars but not hard core, it was a little disappointing. And for those who are not that familiar with Star Wars, who only see this as a movie, it was a total failure.Good for the fans, not so good for the average movie goer, Revenge of the Sith, as with the other prequels, falls far short of Star Wars expectations, averaging a 5 out of 10.",5,3,7,5 November 2005
Raging Bull," Raging Mad Cow Disease
","Based upon Scorsese movies like Raging Bull, Casino, and Cape Fear, the typical DeNiro/Scorsese movie is A+ acting with F- directing.It's the story/writing that makes or breaks a movie, and sadly the story/writing somewhat broke this movie, mostly because it wasn't Scorsese proof.Although Robert DiNiro and Joe Pesci did an excellent job portraying their characters, the movie overall was very forgettable, lame and impotent. A waste of excellent acting talent. This movie is totally uninspiring, pointless, and largely unwatchable.The fight scenes, from a shameless and unforgiving director, were very impotent. Character development, going nowheres fast. The black and white effect, completely pointless.Whereas King Midas was able to turn everything into gold with a simple touch, Scorsese touched this movie and turned it into fecal matter.Raging Bull at best can only be given a 3 out of 10, and mostly due to excellent acting.",3,16,41,23 February 2006

","The Sixth Sense revolves around a child psychiatrist, who seems to be suffering from marriage problems and a failure at one point in his life, trying to help a young boy cope with his ability to communicate with the dead.The whole movie after the first scene, did start out a little confusing, but as it moved on, it started to evolve and make sense. Much of the terror and fright wasn't exactly up to snuff, but the overall drama and presentation was irresistible. Leading up to an ending that can take you by surprise, relating to events that happen throughout the whole movie.Great directing, good acting, great story, give the Sixth Sense .... 8.5 out of 10",8,0,0,8 April 2006
Casino," Gambled and lost
","The great thing about this movie are the strong cast and the strong characters they portray. The incredible acting talents of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci definitely bring their characters to life. In reality, THEY, and other incredible talents made the movie memorable. And they are the ones who prevented this movie from being nominated for the worst picture award.Because when you look at the whole movie without those incredible talents, it is very lame and impotent. It has a great beginning, an interesting ending, but much of the middle is worthless. Out of 3 hours of movie, maybe 1 is watchable.It can be compared to a practical joke that involves a piece of paper that says, 'How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over.' And on the other side it says 'How do you keep an idiot busy, turn over.' In terms of entertainment and development, it would as effective to make a 20 minute movie, and repeat that exact same 20 minute movie over and over again until near the end of the movie. Cause it has no interesting plot twists. No real character development after the initial introduction around the beginning. And much of it falls under the 'yeah, and?' category.Altogether, this movie gambled and lost.",4,5,14,19 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Classical
","In simplest forms, Star Wars, like many other space operas, is basically cowboys in space. With also a touch of medievalist within it and with a simple distinction between good and evil, making it fun for people for all ages.This movie also succeeds in true escapism, with no references to Earth, with a culture unknown to us, truly taking us to a galaxy far, far away. And that concept may also have been played as to the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.The comedy duo between C-3P0 and R2-D2 will always be memorable. Though we can't understand what R2-D2 is saying, it's the reactions of C-3P0 that brings it to life.Though still 3 years away from reaching Star Trek's racial and sexual equality, the damsel in distress concept is not as painfully stereotypical as in others with that concept. Even breaking the stereotyping.This movie is inspirational in terms of visual effects and sci-fi art. Bringing forth creativity. And it was great idea to use dog fight footage from the 2 world wars as references for the incredible star fighter scenes.Though many of the plots for Star Wars comes from other stories and movies, they are seamlessly integrated into this movie.And if Star Wars could have maintained this level of quality all throughout the franchise, it would have been in an extremely close second to Star Trek as best sci-fi genre of all time, and ranking the movie 9.5 out of 10.Unfortunately with the disappointing prequels, the not-quite-up-to-snuff 'Return of the Jedi', and the special editions that in many ways hurts the original trilogy rather than helping it, the Star Wars franchise is now struggling to maintain second place for best sci-fi genre and reduce the original Star Wars to 8.5 out of 10.",8,2,3,17 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Quest Begins
","The quest begins for this 2 hit wonder. The movie is about Luke Skywalker beginning his quest to become a Jedi knight, where he has to struggle with his emotions, and learning a dark secret of his family history, and to the man who murdered his father (as mentioned in the original Star Wars).Not only that, this movie also dwells upon the obsession that Darth Vader has over Luke, and to the reason why he is risking everything over the young man. As well as a growing relationship between Han Solo and Princess Leia. This movie also brings forth 2 memorable quotes, which one not only reveals Vaders hidden secret, but also an incredible shock value that still ripples through pop culture today.As well, this movie is the last movie where the Star Wars franchise exceeded general movie expectations, and met Star Wars expectations. After that, the franchise expectations drops. Dropping this movie to 7.5 out of 10 instead of 8.But still, this movie and the original is still a 2 hit wonder.",7,0,1,30 December 2005
Sin City," Sinfully good
","A surrealistic world created by Frank Miller. And he and Robert Rodriguez successfully brought this story to life.It revolves around different stories that intertwine with each other. In a 30's or 40's style story successfully updated for todays world.Each of the characters were well acted and successfully portrayed the way they were suppose to. Where you felt remorse, pity, hate right where they wanted you to feel it.Shot in a style that is truly unique. That makes it feel like you are in that graphic novel.You can truly follow and get lost in the world of Sin City.",10,0,2,24 December 2005
Gangs of New York," Best picture nominee why?
","When I first heard of Gangs of New York, my first impression is that it wasn't going to be that good. But I decided to challenge my preconceptions, before they challenged me (Enterprise; Strange New Worlds; Season 1). So I rented it and watched it, but it was a hell of a lot worse than my preconception.The movie starts out with young Amsterdam Vallon watching his father killed by Bill the Butcher to start the whole quest for vengeance. But after that, the whole movie went downhill and was rendered totally forgettable and unwatchable.After the murder, the storyline just dragged on to being totally pointless to where it no longer had a story. The final battle between Vallon and the Butcher was very impotent, like much of the action. Another case of big orchestra, little show. Where the trailer was only watchable part of the movie.And Gangs of New York instead of being nominated for best picture, it made hell of a lot more sense to nominate it for the Rasperry award for worst picture. And in all likelihood, it should have won that.",1,62,118,21 November 2005
Gladiator," A slave more powerful than your expectations
","Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.Every minute brings forth more intrigue to Gladiator. Non-stop action keeps the adrenaline pumping, the portrayal of the characters makes us see what the director and writer wants us to see, and a story that keeps us coming for more.Russell Crowe does an excellent job in his portrayal of Maximus, a man cut down from a general to a slave, and then became more powerful than the emperor, exactly as the tag-line says. His despair over the death of his family and the future he's denied, his disgust over the games, and his quest for vengeance when he finds the man who killed his family and his close friend.Joaquin Phoenix also does a marvelous job for Commodus. Successfully showing him as a spoiled rich boy lusting for more power, and viewing his as someone not to be feared, but pitied.Even though Oliver Reed died before he could shoot some very important scenes, they flawlessly brought him back from the dead digitally to say his final words, 'Shadows and Dust,' from a test shoot earlier making the approach of the climax even more gripping.Alien, Blade Runner, and now Gladiator. What ever Ridley Scott does for these movies, he should keep it up and other directors should take notes.",10,7,11,22 November 2005
V for Vendetta," 11/05
","An incredible action/adventure thriller of a completely mysterious man codenamed V.The story is very inspiring, and has many similarities to todays 9/11 world.The story revolves around a highly cultured and poetic terrorist, codename V, fighting a terrorist state leader, Chancellor Adam Sulter, while along the way trying to allow a young woman, Evey, to see the world as he sees it.Even though that Sutler in this movie is a bad guy without a doubt, all throughout the movie the question is still out whether V is truly a good guy or a bad guy. The question is raised about V because V does cross the line with killing without remorse and employing the Stockholm syndrome onto Evey. But even with him crossing the line, he is still in many ways a good guy in this movie. He never hurts the innocent. He still has integrity, even risking everything he is working towards. And he opens and reawakens the minds of the free thinkers.Evey is one of 2 people in this movie that is beyond a reasonable doubt a good guy/gal. No matter what, she wants to do the right thing. From doing what she can to stop a terrorist state to preventing a murder onto a villain. Showing courage when the time arises.The other good guy in this movie is Chief Inspector Finch. Even though he is part of the council of the totalitarian state, the murders and terrorism perpetrated by V allows him to see the real world in a new light. Making him a better person.Though being unable to see V's real face, this adds mysteriousness to the character. And Hugo Weaving's voice and speech patterns helps with the emotion and expressiveness of V.There are some areas where the drama of the movie does lag by a noticeable amount, dropping it to a 9/10, and what looks like a partial rip off of the Matrix style fighting, way to go Wachowski Brothers, dropping it even further.But all in all, V for Vendetta is still definitely a movie that deserves to be watched, and even more the graphic novel it was based upon to be read.Give 'V for Vedetta' ..... 8.5 out of 10",8,1,3,29 March 2006
