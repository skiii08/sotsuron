Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An Excellent Work, Thank You Mr. Lucas
","A Prequel, the we long awaited, finally arrived. I read lots of comments about it before I actually see the film, but I made my mind clear before the big time.From now on in my comment, there may be some spoilers, enter at your own risk.First lets start with the plot, This is a good story that takes us into the enchanted Galaxy that we know for a long time. Some may say that, this is not the very beginning, still there's lots of things to explain, about Obi-Wan, about Qui-Gon, about the disappearence of the Sith lords, about the Jedi Council, maybe about the creation of the galaxy itself, C'mon guys, actually there can't be any beginning. Consider this as a beginning of the big events that changed a whole galaxy. Most of people say that there's no character develop, WRONG!!!, there is development, but not the way that we see all the time, we understand the characters, as they spoke, act... For example, let's take Qui-Gon, his character is noble, patient and realistic. He's a great master and loyal to the council, He also very proud of his young padawan, and he somehow knew that soon he must go away, and the one mentioned in the prophecy must be given to safe hands, he's full of hope about the chosen one and he believes that he will bring the balance as told in the prophecy, bottom line, he will bring balance in his own way. Is it enough for an explanation? I think it is... Jake Lloyd is an excellent choice for the role of young Anakin. Has anyone realized his resemblance with Luke? He's not aware of his great powers, but the force is helping him all the time, Everybody thinks this is luck, but it ain't, it's the pure force that helps him in the pod race and destroying the droid control ship. The Phantom Menace is an excellent choice for the name.  Everybody says, Darth Maul (cool guy) has very little screen time, I agree, but he's there for some purpose, and he serves this purpose very well. His purpose is simple, to show the sith lords' power to everyone, he's only an apprentice, but he fights better than a Jedi Master, and his gifted padawan. And he also causes Obi-Wan's anger to control him, and lead him to the dark side, we already know that he didn't chose the dark side, but we also know that he could easily be turned. And the turmoil in the galactic senate has very well shown in the film. The early seeds of a love planted smartly. Anakin is very smart and bright boy. But he also have great fears about his future, most important fear that he have is about his mother, we will see that if they meet again in the future.Now I want to tell some more about the visualization of the film. I thank every one in the special f/x crew. They made an unbelievable job. The visual effects are eye popping. I can't find the words to describe them, only your own eyes is capable of realizing how amazing they are. The pod race, the fighter droids, the space ships, Naboo palace, Coruscant, The Senate. The CGI`s is way beyond than anything you ever see.John 'The Genius' Williams, is unbelievable as always, he wrote a breathtaking score for a breathtaking film.For the last, the critics were wrong (as always), The movie is 2 hrs. 10 min. long, but after watching, if you watch the movie again in your head, you will see that the film tells a story that maybe in hands of some other director that will take maybe 10 hours to tell (like Terence Malick :P) And a little addition about Jar-Jar, yes he's annoying but, not that much, he's banished from his world for being clumsy, and he's clumsy, he always makes clumsy things. But I like him some way, he's the funny part of the film and this is fun for every one, especially for the ones, who knew the worth of Star Wars saga, and appreciate it.MR. LUCAS, THANK YOU...THIS IS AN EXCELLENT WORK.MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU, ALWAYS........",10,0,0,31 May 1999
Blade," Wes Is Back!!!
","After great action packed thrillers, something happened to Wes, and now he's totally back. Blade is a good film, and I can't think of anyone else to play this role. Everything is well-balanced in the film, action, thriller, drama. And of course the fighting scenes which were designed very well. By the way, quality of the marvel super hero is undiscussable. For the last word; everybody go see this one!!!",8,0,1,23 December 1998
The Mummy Returns," Worthy Sequel
","Time for truth...Along with the Aliens, Mummy Returns is definitely better-than-its-original sequel that we're not oftenly see. All of the original cast has returned, and gave their unique, brilliant performances. Brendan Fraser is superb as always, I think he is the future Bruce Willis in movie industry, Rachel Weisz performance is at the top (Evelyn character somehow improved and became more smarter), John Hannah is the comic relief just like he was in the first film, Oded Fehr is very cool as Ardeth Bay and finally Arnold Vosloo as Priest Imhotep is great as he was in the first. Among the newly introduced characters, the boy Alex was brilliant all the way. The story of *minor spoiler* Imhotep, Anck Su Namun and Nefertari cleverly revealed, and all the loose ends were tied together completely. You can find all that you want; action, humor, thrill, tense, jump scenes, great visual effects, story twists...The only thing I complain about is *minor spoiler* about The Scorpion King. He has very little screen time and at the end when we see his *major spoiler* scorpion form, the visual effects are not quite good compared to the other visualization in the whole picture. Other than that, Mummy Returns is a worthy sequel that really deserved to be seen. I saw it, and I will see it again.",8,0,0,18 May 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," The first better-than-its-original adaptation
","I'm a fan of King's work. And I confess that, when I first saw the Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption, I didn't like it very much. After I heard the coming adaptation in 1994, I thought to myself 'It's gonna be a cliche prison movie'. But when I first watched it on the big screen, I was totally shocked. I think they made a great favor to Forrest Gump and Tom Hanks that year. The 6 academy awards was meant to be for this film. I still get the same excitement while watching this one over and over again. Now I'm waiting for the DVD version for the  film. And I also like to see a special edition for this one....",10,0,0,14 January 1999
The Thin Red Line," 6 Hours of Boredom
","I like all kind of movies, and I watched so many bad movies...But this one is really the WORST of ALL. It's been just one day since I watched it, and I don't even remember the plot. I thought this one as a war movie, but I realized it's nothing more than a documentary about nature. The film was 3 hours long, but it seemed to me like 6 hours. If you wanna watch a realistic war movie, go see Ryan, If you wanna watch the nature, the animals, actually everything but a war. You can see this one over and over again. But if you ask me...stay VERY away from this thing.",1,2,7,1 March 1999
