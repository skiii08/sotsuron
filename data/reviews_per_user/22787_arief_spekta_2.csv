The King's Speech," The King's Speech is The King Movie!
","I'm not so fond of drama and history. But when watching this movie, my views changed in the film world. The film gives a different nuance. The plot is so complex and easy to understand. There are elements of humor that slips so indirectly I am out laughing. Somehow, this movie makes my heart beat faster and makes me wonder when the king speaks to all people in the world. Every scene has meaning and does not make my eyes turned away. Me as if brought and entered the atmosphere was so bored I could not follow the plot. His acting was also really nice and real. I am among those who sometimes stutters when speaking. And indeed, if the words are made ​​like the song, it will say clearly without stuttering.",10,0,0,1 April 2011
