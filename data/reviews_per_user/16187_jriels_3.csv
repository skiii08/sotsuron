Minority Report," It's a movie!
","Alot of people are complaining about the plot holes and the society in the future.  I see another hot topic are those wooden balls with the names on them.  People think it is totally unbearable that the precogs can figure out a name, right? Well, I'd like to restate to some of those blessed souls who've forgotten over the years: IT IS A MOVIE!  A bunch of wealthy and somewhat artistic men and women got a script, figured they could make some money, who knows, maybe a few thought it had some issues dear unto their hearts, but whatever.  It is a flick, a film.  It is not a reality.  It is viewed by us, the audience, on a screen.  A screen of fantasy and adventure. Who cares if the abused dolphin-kids could get a name.  It worked to the point where his, John's (Tom), name popped out of ye tube.  Leave it at a good flick, mayhaps it could have been better, oh well, the REAL world goes on, whether bored and silly overworlders such as we realize it!",Null,0,0,10 March 2003
Sleepy Hollow," nothing special
","The movie was not as good as everyone makes it out to be.  Come on people, just have, for once, a demon wreaking havoc on a small town.  Why bother with old bitter ladies getting revenge using a freaky German?Having said that, Depp's performance was good, his character was well written and the pretty girl--not innocent, but not dirty, that's good.",Null,0,0,12 December 2002
Braveheart," Superb, Wallace and Gibson are dynamite!
","One of those movies that you can watch over and over again. Director, Mel Gibson, pushes through a barrier of American safety and hurls us into a struggle of freedom. Writer, Randall Wallace, creates an atmosphere of horror where we see an injustice inflicted upon a people and a man. A heroic tale of honor and courage. What starts as a small rebellion that leads to a carnage-filled revolution. If not for great acting, than this movie is excellent for wonderful special effects, if not special effects, this movie is superb for its historical accuracy, if not accuracy, this movie is excellent because it's Braveheart.",8,0,1,4 June 2002
