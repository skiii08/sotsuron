The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Dumb and dumber
","I liked the first movie, despite the strange allusions to Willy Wonker, and the Sequel with its introduction to the world of Victors which actually seemed a bit more realistic.But the 3rd movie seems to be a glory fest for the main character and her love - a bit like Twilight meets Jesus Christ Superstar all of a sudden. Everything else - even the war - the other characters - take a physical back step.I found it ridiculous that in the midst of a genocidal war, a technological war even - the main character can go rambling around doing her own excursions in a battlefield area - at one stage even having a picnic out in the open in a warzone. The Capital didn't have drones? They didn't have snipers? The Capital didn't have the radar or even a nuke missile?It seems more like a wet dream dreamed up for the Socialist International. Look I hate the excesses of the capitalist system as much as you do - but having unarmed people storm machine gun stormtrooper soldiers who are so technological advanced that they don't have barbed wire barricades and where everything is hinged on the whims of a teenage girl armed with a bow and arrow fighting in a super advanced war is about as believable as a porn plot but not half as amusing. This is a ridiculous story - best to watch this if you're drunk.",5,12,17,22 December 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Wallflower movie
","'Wallflower' was set in the 1980s. In many ways it reminded me of the old John Hughes' movies, 'Somekind of Wonderful', Breakfast Club', 'Pretty in Pink' etc. Its about a group of misfits in High School. Yup. The main character goes to a new school and makes new friends with cool people - ie. the class clown played by the charismatic Ezra Miller (who could have been played by Jon Cryer aka 'Duckie' if he was 20 years younger) and of course the pretty Emma Watson.For Wallflowers they all have 'colorful' backgrounds which I felt was a lazy way by the writers' to spark interest in the story. Its as if I'm watching Marvel's New Mutants.<ul><li>spoiler alert - don't read any further.</li></ul>I didn't feel the childhood abuse background story of Charlie really did justice to the story. First off - I felt that the suggestion that Charlie's childhood abuse problems makes him freak out (and someone who doesn't work out or do any form of martial arts and) can suddenly turn into the Incredible Hulk and beat up three school jocks in the cafeteria who were twice his size as too fantastical. OK, if he had swung a chair and cracked them on the head and run off maybe I'd buy it.It got to a point when midway through the film I was seriously wondering whether Charlie wasn't stuck in a mental asylum dreaming the entire fantastic story all up. I mean he goes to school - finds a teacher who encourages him and tell him he's going to become a big time writer - he makes friends with the coolest kids in the school - and he eventually has hawt sex with the girl of his dreams. ... and he also gets to bash up the school bullies - Three of them in one go. I think it would have been funnier if they had camped it up a bit and got him to do a Bruce Lee stance.The friendship between Charlie and Patrick (Nothing) was I felt one of the more interesting developments of the story - but the writers didn't seem to have the ability to expand it more than a WTF side-issue. Instead we have this childhood abuse trauma story being back scattered all the way through the film before it strikes the plot like the iceberg hitting the Titanic.Was it a plot device that was suppose to help make the character more sympathetic or to explain his supernatural powers? Or are broken things more interesting? The story had a great question and answer - 'Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?' (answer) 'We accept the love we think we deserve.' They could have and should have run the theme of the story on just that eternal question, rather than branch off into Charlie's childhood trauma. I'm not belittling childhood victims but this sidestory didn't seem to help push the main story along.I wanted to see more on Charlie's anguish and turmoil with Sam. That Sam's relationship with the University photographer ends just nicely for him to have a one-night stand with her came across as rather manufactured - almost fitting in with a school boy's fantasy.So what's it all about? A Pleasant but muddled tale of clichéd characters. I liked the music though and the film had its moments. I liked the dance scene when Charlie meekly walked over to the dance floor to join and be accepted by Patrick and Sam. Come on Eileen - Lyrics by the Dexys Midnight Runners. Awesome song.I liked the moment Charlie gazed in wonderment at Sam (Emma Watson). Haven't we all dreamed such dreams?",7,1,2,11 December 2012
Skyfall," Stupid plot so big a train could drive through it.
","The thing that gets me about this film is that it is laughingly ludicrous.Most of the plot is utterly implausible - the main characters do absolute stupid things - esp. in the climatic fight scene.The villain has a bomb device which he detonates precisely at the moment when he is climbing up a ladder and Bond is directly beneath the train.Bond places the head of the British Spy Intelligence in the middle of the Moor in his old home. There is no cover. And there is no way of the rest of M15 et al to come and help them if they are in trouble. He has no way how many mercenaries the villain will bring along. He doesn't even know whether the guy will bring along an attack helicopter or heavy weapons. He's just going to stay out there in the middle of nowhere armed with his dad's shotty, an old game keeper and his useless boss. Wow brilliant strategy there.Its not as if they didn't have a choice. He specifically took the scenic route to get to where he is and even laid a bread trail for the bad dude to follow - the same bad dude that has been waiting 20 years and amassed a sizable fortune to get what he wants. He could have showed up with a freaking huge army - staked it out with snipers - killed 007 and just walked into to do a Ramsay Bolton Snow on M, not before pumping her for any intel on the UK spy network.This is probably in keeping with the Bond franchise from the Roger Moore/Remington Steele days - but I thought that we had entered into a new era with an emphasis on realism?I found the whole show laughable. Best watched after getting drunk.I had to watch Tinker Tailor Spy 10 times to purge the memory of this shocking film out of my mind.",3,7,16,11 December 2012
Alexander," Jude Law should have been Alexander
","I'm not sure whether its too late- but when I watched the film I kept on thinking 'Why didn't they choose Jude Law for the role (of Alexander the Great)?' With all due respect to Collin Feral he doesn't have the same charisma or onstage presence to pull this sort of role off.You needed an actor who could help the audience see and feel how one man managed to convince an army to march half way around the world, and fight all his battles.You needed an actor who had that aura, that beauty that Alexander the Great had. For a couple of centuries after his death, he was still worshiped as a god.You also needed to have an actor who had that sense of arrogance, self-entitlement - not a bad boy - but someone who felt he had the right to own the world because he did.And only Jude Law (circa 1999) could have pulled that feat off.",1,1,1,9 October 2012
Bohemian Rhapsody," Story written by an Astrophysics Professor
",I wanted very much to like this show. I'm a big fan of Queen. But the film narrative was rather bland. Rami also seemed a bit overawed by Freddie's presence and couldn't match the same level of intensity and manic exuberance that he displayed.,6,2,7,2 November 2018
No Country for Old Men," If you thought that was bad
","The title of this film comes from first line in the poem written by Yeats called 'Sailing To Byzantium'. The poem is about how the Byzantium Empire, despite its magnificence, was slowly and surely crumbling into inevitable irreparable decay.In the same way, this movie is about how the spirit of decay and destruction is coming into American Society. Its an allegory, mayhaps a loose one perhaps. But it will help you to see it as such.The psycho killer like death is unstoppable. Towards the end, two characters discuss fate. It seems absurd, a random twist that serves no purpose in the story.But nonetheless I liked this movie. It had atmosphere. It had soul. Sometimes that is good enough to make you ignore the other inconsistencies of the actual story.The performances of all the actors were worth watching. The main villain was riveting.As for some loopholes ... Why did Josh return back to the drug trade massacre scene? Answer -He wanted to give a bottle of water to the dying drug-driver. It made no sense and improbable. It was foolish and dangerous. But he was on a high after coming back with $2million. And humans sometimes do very dumb things.",9,2,6,9 March 2008
The Big Blue," Stupid kid drowns and wins Darwin award
","The photography was great but the plot, directing really was horrible. And this coming from me, a person whose done over 100+ scuba dives and has a desire to dive down to the bottom of the Marianas Trench, 10,000m under the sea (and not return).1. Can someone tell me why the kid and the Uncle didn't attempt to pull out the dad at the start of the film? He was only in about 10m of water for crying out loud. They let him plunge to his death for no apparent reason other than to create a silly melodrama.2. The Uncle should have pulled the dive rope and hauled back the father asap when trouble occurred but he didn't. Why? 3. It seems all the characters, esp the lead character, are morons.4. The female lead is also a moron, sacrificing her job and career to go chase after a pretty boy idiot she barely knows.5. Morons and diving don't mix. And worse, they endanger the lives of the rest of the dive team. There's a scene where the divers are drinking alcohol before doing deep sea work. Its not funny. If they get into trouble - other people have to risk their lives to pull them out.6. This is the best part - when Enzo fails in his dive attempt and is pulled out of the water - the moron scientist pushes away the rest of the crew including the medics who are trying to render first aid to Enzo. WTF??? 7. This is the second best part - when the lead character learns that his lover is pregnant with his child and wants him to marry him etc.. - the fool dives into the bottom of the sea to swim with a dolphin and dies. Father fail. Partner fail. Human fail.8. This film is very long and boring - and normally I like long boring films.",7,9,24,28 September 2009
Taken," Dexter meets 24
","I liked it. This film is basically about a Bourne-type character who goes after his kidnapped daughter whose been taken for the sex slavery trade.It has the usual clichés - kidnapped tourists turned into drugged sex slaves - Albanian gangsters - Arab slavers - which panders to your xenophobic side. And a super spy which kicks their asses. How macho is that? But hey, it does have a big element of truth there. The female sex slavery trade is alive and well and those groups do take a big part in it. This truth may bother your liberal tendencies - deal with it. Its just as accurate as any of Michael Moore or Al Gore's films. :) Now that I've dumped on your lunch, I thought the film pacing, story, was pretty good. It probably won't win many Academy Awards which would be going to a film about a deafnblind mime. But you won't be falling asleep and your girlfriend and daughters would probably be more careful when they go traveling. I'll give it 10/10 - an extra 3 because of films like History Boys which was a totally horrible film.",10,3,3,2 September 2009
There Will Be Blood," There will be Blood
","Watching There will be Blood is like going on a Safari and watching the most ferocious and biggest Lion stalking around, roaring. And despite the fact that you know you are safe behind a bullet proof screen, you are still terrified because that Lion is so abominably frightening. Then you see a Lion-tamer and a child walk into the area and smack the beast around for awhile and you think to yourself - the dude and kid are going to die.Daniel Day-Lewis is the Lion. The Lion-tamer is the preacher. They give absolutely powerful and riveting and engaging performances.This is what movies should be about.",10,3,4,8 August 2012
Inception," The Butterfly dreaming that its a man
","'I'll tell you a riddle. You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't be sure. But it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you where this train will take you?' I loved how Marion Cotillard spoke those lines - she had this slightly deranged tone - which made it perfect. (Marion is the actresses who played Mal, Cobb's dead wife.) This review will reveal practically the entire story. So be warned.I liked it. I liked it because it was well directed, had great pacing, excellent action sequences, great lines, and great acting. Cotillard gave an outstanding performance - the sheer venom coming from her in the basement scene was so intense!The story flowed smoothly - so seamlessly that one didn't notice the absurdities and there were plenty of them.But the hallmark of a great film is that you keep the audience entertained and enthralled... that Nolan caught our imaginations using a spinning top shows his genius. He created a believable world where people can enter into other people's dream and various states of consciousness all through a 'hair band', some tubing, a special suitcase and of course, duct tape. Nolan really pulls the rabbit out of a hat made of thin air.When I saw the previews, I was initially skeptical and thought it was going to another Matrix wannabe. But I was so pleased with the film that I watched it twice, loving it more the second time.Synopsis: the story is about this dream thief, Cobb (Leonardo Dicaprio), who lost his wife, Mal, and blames himself for her tragic fate. He is able, through special technology, to enter into people's dreams and steal their ideas or plant new ideas into their brain.He gets an offer from Saito, a fabulously wealthy Industrialist, to sabotage his rival's plans to dominate the energy industry.In this whole process Cobb (which in Urda means 'dream') and his friends undergo a series of harrowing chase and fight sequences; somehow Cobbs's dead' wife gets involved because his perception of her is hidden in his sub-conscious. OK! Here comes the big spoiler: Its all just ONE BIG DREAM. From the very start to the finishing end. The entire story is a big dream sequence - Its filled with implausible, unreal scenarios – the sort of things that happen in a dream. Cue R.E.M's song 'Losing My Religion'.Cobbs never in reality enters the dream world of Saito who later personally saves him from his ex-client's hit men, and then goes to his rival's son to plant an idea into his mind so that he can be reunited with his children. The only thing that is real is Cobb and Mal can't be together and he can't be with his kids.Think about it: 1. Why would Saito, the Japanese Industrialist who is ranked No. 2 in the Energy Industry have been sitting alone on a train? He's so rich he can buy an entire airline yet he's driving around in the back alleys of an African 3rd world nation, risking his own life, to personally rescue Cobb from a gang of trigger happy mercenaries? Fisher is suppose to be one of the most richest men in the world. Where is his entourage, his bodyguards? His PA? Can't his staff hire another private jet? He's the heir to the world's largest and most powerful Energy company and yet, he's forced to ride coach to the most important event in his life.2. Crucial lines are repeated by different characters. Why did Saito repeat the same line as Cobb's wife: 'I want you take a leap of faith with me.' This is not a coincidence. But it would make sense if the entire plot occurred if Cobb was dreaming this all up.3. Cobb's children - they don't age. Not even in real life. In the end sequence, we see Cobb's children again - in the same pose in the garden, and wearing same/similar clothing. Yes, another coincidence? I don't think so. Even if Cobb cannot go to America to be with his kids what is there to stop his father-in-law from taking them to a safe foreign location so that Cobb can be reunited with them?4. And probably the most important clue: Mal, his wife, says it herself or rather Cobb's subconscious is trying to warn him that he is still dreaming. The specific line is: 'No creeping doubts? Not feeling persecuted Dom? Chased around the globe by *anonymous corporations* and police forces. The way the projections persecute the dreamer. Admit it. You don't believe in one reality any more....'Yes, draw the dots and you'll conclude its one big dream.So its a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream... And Alice wandered into the Hall of Mirrors and saw a million, million reflections of herself. 'Which one is me?' She asked. 'All of them and yet none of them.' said the White Rabbit.The idea that the whole plot is a dream sequence can not be stated outright, otherwise it would spoil the whole story.And therein lies the genius of Nolan – he weaves a story is based upon hair-bands, a spinning top, fantastic preposterous chain of events - and yet, its so believable, so real.On a side note: this may provide an opportunity to write a sequel to the movie. Inception 2: So Cobbs is with his kids in the garden, but then sees Mal walk by, his children call after her. (... dead pause ...) Wait a second, she's dead. But if she's here then... (focuses on Cobb's horrified expression) : cue brass theme music now.",10,3,9,16 July 2012
Prometheus," A potential epic movie turned into a B-grade horror
","When I was a child, I used to marvel at the awesome Science Fiction art done by Chris Foss, Vincent Di Fate. They were magnificent artwork, awe inspiring stuff.Watching the first half of the movie I felt drawn back to that time - I was pure joy at the sheer brilliance of the set design, props and mesmerized by that delicately elegant, and strangely ominous piano soundtrack - Chopin's Raindrops. I liked the homage to other films - David's voice and sinister child-like curiosity echoes Hal (Space Odyssey 2001) and the 1972 sci-fi film, Silent Running.Unfortunately, the story was ghastly written.So let's recap - Big ivory colored alien spacemen nicknamed 'Engineers' came to ancient Earth and created life - hence the drawings in different civilizations and times. However 2000 years ago - during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ - something bad happened and the Engineers on the distant planet all get killed mysteriously, possibly by the black goo infected by humanity's evil. We are meant to deduce that its somehow people's fault. So back to the present - two Scientists - Hollo 'woohoo' way and Elizabeth 'I believe what I want to believe' Shaw discover ancient drawings which point to a distant solar system that contain a planet like Earth which they believe contain our Alien makers. They convince Weyland, a Rupert Murdoch archetype that this could be the place where the Alien Space Gods live. And he spends one trillion dollars to sent them into space to track down the planet.Inflation must have spaced out in the future because even with one trillion dollars Weyland could not hire a more professional group of astronauts. So we're saddled with motley crew made out of the 'Wrong Stuff' - the smart-ass Captain, the 'I goofed up' navigator from the Spaceship Icarus (IMDB:Sunshine), a geologist from the School of Scottish Soccer Hooligans and the usual idiots, standard space monster food.This haphazard approach extends to everything they do - they land their giant spaceship straight on the planet without first sending a probe to check for danger. No thought is given to whether the atmosphere is hostile to the spaceship.When by some luck they come across an Alien Space Temple they immediately rush to check out. No thought is given to the possibility that life or other cities may exist on other parts of the planet. Its as if they had driven 6 hours to the shopping mall.The amateurish attitude carries on - the scientists remove their helmets in the Alien Temple allowing themselves to be infected by whatever bacteria human science hasn't encountered yet. Then they make the Greatest Discovery, a decapitated 2000 year old alien head which by some miracle is still alive. They zip-lock it back to the ship and predictably it explodes.Considering that they are suppose to be top scientists, it is infuriating to see them behave with the aplomb of first year high school students.The only one who seems to have a clue is the humanoid robot - David, who strangely knows precisely how to operate the Alien doors and equipment. But he behaves like a child, curiously constantly wanting to touch things and conducting his own secret experiments with alien goo and helping a alien fetus to germinate. Predictable the humans constantly remind 'Pinocchio' that he is not a human and has no soul or emotion. Wow, I hope the human-like robot doesn't develop a human-like complex and try and kill them.There are many religious metaphors and parallels running through the show - adding them would be a nice touch if they were delivered with skill and subtlety. But Ridley Scott hammers it home like a schoolboy.1. Prometheus, the god who gets his abdomen ripped out for giving fire to the humans.2. Female Hero Scientist, rips out her belly to take out the human alien hybrid fetus.3. The hybrid fetus impregnates the Giant Alien and their offspring rips its way out through the host's stomach. Predictably we get to see 'The Alien'.4. An Engineer Alien, wearing a 'Jesus Christ' cloak just in case we didn't get his point, has to drink a cup to kill himself to create the world. 5. Holloway allows himself to be burned to death carrying on the Prometheus theme.This is 'Rain in Spain/Plain' theme is predictable and boring.Then there are the shoe horn moments - like Weyland's last dying words 'So there's nothing out there?' And I see Ridley slapping a fat yellow post-it sticker marked 'Atheism vs Religious' here.The plot stinks. What we needed to see was a great sense of foreboding, dread, and an inescapable despair - see Shutter Island, Inception, and the first Alien movie. I thought the Chopin's piano music was foretelling that? Instead, we get slapstick horror!!! Loony Tunes stuff. Ridley Scott seems to have lost his killer touch. To have clouded his film with 3rd rate religious metaphors, stupid scenarios. Its so sad to see a film with million dollar effects and the materials for an Epic get porked into a B-grade horror flick.I think the problem with many famous directors is that as they become powerful they become complacent. Like the Emperor who was conned into wearing fake clothes made out of air - no one dares to contradict him, former colleagues who were instrumental in their success get forgotten. Only people who know how to stoke their egos get chosen to help. The end result is that we get mediocre stories like this.6 points for the CGI, set design, and overall layout, 1 point for Ms Theron who looked stunning. Minus three for the story plots.",4,7,11,11 July 2012
Casino Royale," A bit more realistic
","Just watched Casino Royale- based on the 1st James Bond book. I was fortune to get tickets for the premiere (here in Singapore).Its pretty good- I'd say there is an emphasis on realism... comparatively speaking. The previous JB films were pure fantasy, almost parody. You know- shooting lasers using massive space satellites in outer space.Except for one or two silly plot holes, which initially is not so apparent, this new film held up pretty well. Watch out for the vague reference to the Ong-Bak film at the start of the show. I thought the start was too laid back, old school.The new Bond is more of a throwback to the young Sean Connery, suave, charming, deadly with a hint of brutality and menace. The previous Bond was too fakey and artificial.This one takes it cue from the Bourne Supremacy rather than Phantom Menace. Less on special effects- more on style and plot.Its cool. Watch it. And somehow you'll end up being a little bit more motivated to go to the gym.",10,3,7,16 November 2006
The Thin Red Line," Voiceovers were annoying
",Show don't tell. This is the maxim of the film medium.If there is going to be a soliloquy then use it sparingly and not as a crutch for the plot.I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the film was also very preachy about the 'violence of war'.This was one of the few films which I could not complete watching.Boring. Preachy. Stodgy.,4,6,10,11 April 2018
