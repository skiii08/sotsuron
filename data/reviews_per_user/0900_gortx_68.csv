Ford v Ferrari," Very well Produced and acted. Enjoyable, but, script issues
","FORD V FERRARIThe battle between Ford and Ferrari has not gone down as one of the previous century's most important or serious, but, it does provide a nice backdrop for this entertaining drama.
FORD V FERRARI focuses on Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) a one-time Le Mans champion race car driver (1959) who was forced into retirement. He helps design new vehicles including hot-headed journeyman driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale). When the Ford motor company contacts Shelby in 1964 with the idea of helping them design a car that can beat the vaunted Ferrari line of winners at Le Mans and it's charismatic owner Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Shelby enlists Miles and his band of mechanics and friends to take on the task.
Of course, working for the huge Ford corporation means also dealing with corporate interference. Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is portrayed as the benign intermediary between Shelby and The Man -- Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts). VP Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas) is the 'heavy' -- the kiss ass in the company who only looks out for himself. The company politics angle could have been interesting, but Ford and, especially, Beebe are cartoonish villains. Letts and Lucas do the best they can, but, just come off as buffoons more appropriate for a sit-com than the big screen.
Fortunately, when the action sticks to the racetrack, the movie mostly hums. Francois Audouy's Production Design is sharp and captured well by Phedon Papamichael's cinematography (although, like with NEBRASKA one wishes he'd tone down the digital 'grain'). It's a well-done physical and aural (David Giammarco's sound design is aces) production all around. The large cast acquits itself well. Damon is very effective as the driven but level-headed Shelby. Bale gets the showier role and relishes it. Caitriona Balfe brings some perk to the stock role of Miles' patient wife.
James Mangold Directs with a sure hand. His insistence on accuracy (for the most part) and actual vehicles and locations rather than a surfeit of CGI gives the movie some grit and verve that helps make up for the 'sports film' cliches which hamper the screenplay (three writers). Mangold is a pretty strong writer himself (LOGAN, COP LAND), so it's unfortunate he apparently didn't have much input there. The epilogue is surprisingly melancholy and lifts the movie from the standard -- Rah! Rah! straight to the credits finale -- most sports films settle for. The maturity only highlights how lite much of the rest of the movie is. FORD V FERRARI is the kind of A List big budgeted drama that is rarely seen any more. It's enjoyable, but, a mediocre script keeps it from finishing higher.",Null,0,4,22 November 2019
The Lobster," The Lobster - Greek Crustacean comedy
","THE LOBSTER is almost the very definition of a one-joke movie. Surprisingly, it has become one of the biggest art-house hits of the season. The premise is simple: In some unspecified future, you either couple up with a mate - or, you get turned into the animal of your choice. Singles are shunned - or, worse. Our hero, Dave (Colin Farrell), chooses a Lobster, and, hence, the title.And, for quite a while, the movie manages to use droll humor to amuse. It's never quite as clever as it thinks it is, nor does it ever truly hit its targets. Half-way through there is a turn in the story and a new chapter begins. Unfortunately, the dry humor looses steam and an attempt to humanize the tale never quite works, save for an entertaining clandestine mission by Dave and his cohorts (led by Lea Seydoux). But, it's too little, too late in an overlong movie that stretches it's thin joke too much.Genre fans will recognize bits of Orwell's 1984 as well as more modern examples of alternate history such as the sublime NEVER LET ME GO, MELANCHOLIA, ANOTHER EARTH etc.. I was also a bit reminded of Luis Bunuel's sense of absurdist comedy, but Director Yorgos Lanthimos doesn't have the touch or visual acumen of the best of the master's work.What is surprising is that THE LOBSTER has become an art-house hit despite its offbeat storyline and sensibility. Lanthimos made his name a few years back with DOGTOOTH, but it was mostly noticed by high-minded critics. His follow-up, THE ALPS, was ignored even by those groups. I guess it's the vaguely sci-fi angle and solid reviews that have buoyed THE LOBSTER. That and the fact that it's in English (of course) and stars recognizable faces (if not stars) in Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly.THE LOBSTER isn't a misfire, but, it never transcends it's one-note gimmick either.",Null,1,3,8 June 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Worthy accomplished sequel, if not up to the original
","Two basic questions: 1. Yes, BLADE RUNNER 2049 is a good, solid and worthy successor to the original 1982 classic. 2. My interpretation remains that Deckard is a human. I admit that I was not in the camp that felt that a follow-up to BLADE RUNNER was at all necessary - especially one so belated. Fortunately, the production aligned together a team of top notch talent, and most importantly, one of impeccable integrity. Director Denis Villenueve's 2049 is a direct follow-up, even allowing for the passage of thirty years. It plunges you back into the world of the original, but also adds depth and layers to that world, breaking out of L.A. to expand to San Diego and Las Vegas. Further, the themes of A.I. and humanity are given added layers and meaning. It does a yeoman job of using the time gap as an advantage and not a hindrance. I wasn't expecting such a direct lineage, and it becomes a double edged sword at some crucial junctures. The bare bones plot is simple enough to follow, but, little is exactly as it seems on first blush. And, again, there are several layers to each section of the movie, the most interesting of which is the notion of what exactly it is to be a sentient being in a world so dominated by technology. Whether you are the newest edition of Replicant, a sophisticated Hologram or a lowly cop, the characters always seem to be striving for answers. There's even a Replicant with a Hologram hook-up 3-way sex scene (I admit, I didn't quite buy the tech involved).Villenueve and Producer Ridley Scott have brought back the original film's first screenwriter Hampton Fancher (co-written with Michael Green)and a great production team. The world they create is impeccable as, like the script, it builds upon the original while still adding to that world. Still, as wonderful as the look is, I still have a passion for the original film's Production Design by Lawrence Paull, Jorden Cronewerth's Cinematography and Douglas Trumbull's Smoke, Model and Mirrors special effects. There is a warmth to them that still beckons 35 years later which the admittedly top notch new movie can't quite match. Deakins is one of the world's great DPs and he can make digital look as good as it can, but there's a colder edge to it. As I noted vis a vis Deckard - I interpret things very much with human eyes. Still, despite all the admirable efforts and the multi-layered screenplay, 2049 has substantial flaws. Some of the larger plot points aren't as deep or in need of explication as the filmmakers apparently feel they are. Reveals and twists are drawn out, as are more than a few individual scenes. While the movie's 143 length isn't an issue in and of itself, the pacing and the usage of that running time is. Some of the tonal shifts don't feel as much of a piece as they resemble story beats that must be metered out at given intervals. The 2022 blackout seems at times to be a catch-all rationale to conveniently create and cover gaps in the storytelling. The acting ensemble overall is very good, but the two exceptions are critical. Leto's Wallace never escapes the crazy mad scientist stereotype. It's eccentricity for idiosyncrasy sake. More importantly, the character isn't that interesting. While Wallace didn't have to be at all akin to Joe Turkel's introspective Tyrell in the original, some inkling of an inquisitive scientist would have been welcome to go along with the quirks. Robin Wright is a fine actress, but, unfortunately, her scenes come off as perfunctory and desultory (save for confrontation with Luv). It's as if they needed her character, but never gave enough thought to actually giving her an inner life. Joshi's just a cop, doing a job. It's doubly unfortunate since Wallace and Joshi represent a pair of the few outright fully human characters in the movie. (I'm certain there will be those who argue that the humans are portrayed in that manner by design) Flaws and all, 2049 is a skilled return to the Blade Runner universe. However, I don't believe it will have the repeat watching fervor of the original. Personally, I am not one who watches the same film over and over - with rare exceptions. BLADE RUNNER is one of them. What has always made the '82 film so eminently re-watchable is the mood and atmosphere that echoes the ethereal story-telling, all scored by Vangelis' synth classic. 2049 can be jarring tonally : The loud sound mix. The grating sound effects in the Replicant tests with K at the police station. I generally like Hans Zimmer, but his score (with Benjamin Wallfisch) is, at times, assaultive, despite a number of effective passages (we may never know why Johann Johannsson was replaced). The CGI is technically superb, but hard-edged and too immaculate. As is the cinematography. Director Denis Villenueve is one of the finest working today (INCENDIES, PRISONERS, ARRIVAL), but he isn't the smooth stylist that Ridley Scott is. He is more visceral (unsurprisingly, it is that aspect that works best in 2049). All top notch technically, but the original BLADE RUNNER was like a warm Audio-Visual bath - one you could comfortably luxuriate in. In the end, 2049 very much a direct sequel. Unless you are invested in the original, there isn't much here for casual viewers and newbies. The original (especially my preferred cut - the Workprint Version) was one of those films where the more you explored, the more layers and textures you could appreciate. The sequel feels like it asking the viewer to bring those meanings TO the movie, rather than the other way around. It's like the difference between an original or a copy. Or, in Blade Runner parlance - the difference between a human and replicant. An efficient high functioning replicant - but, one lacking the same human touch.",Null,0,3,12 October 2017
First Man," Fine, inward looking NASA epic about Armstrong & Moon Landing
","FIRST MAN - I am a child of the space race who grew up watching the Jetsons, drinking Tang (because the astronauts did!) and having posters of the Astronauts (including Neil A. Armstrong) on my walls. I give FIRST MAN a titan sized thumbs up for authenticity and accuracy (a few quibbles).There is no question that the NASA moon program of the 60s and early 70s was one of the greatest explorations of human history, crowned with the successful landing of Apollo 11 nearly 50 years ago. As the Lunar Module pilot and, of course, the first man to walk on the moon, Armstrong has always been at the center of attention. But, as FIRST MAN ably displays, that is NOT where Armstrong wanted that focus to be. He was mission driven and not one to bask in the glory. Anything but. (One of the reasons Armstrong has long been such a hero is that he never cashed in on his fame)Armstrong's insular ways presented Screenwriter Josh Singer (SPOTLIGHT) and Director Damien Chazelle (LA LA LAND) with a daunting task: How to capture one of mankind's greatest feats through the lens of such a quiet man? To their credit, the filmmakers approached the challenge head on. Rather than add all kinds of external details (no matter how accurately) and colorful side characters, the film focuses like a laser on Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) and his wife (a strong Claire Foy). There are other characters, of course, but, they never take away from Armstrong and his family. Indeed, the taciturn Armstrong is portrayed as so 'ordinary' that he could just as well have remained a behind-the-scenes engineer if it weren't for his extraordinary pilot skills.Gosling is often a wiry actor, but, he jettisons all that for his intense, yet internalized, performance here. No matter how vast the scale of Armstrong's two missions in space, the film never really wavers from being from the Armstrongs' point of view.* Even while on the moon, there are times you forget Buzz Aldrin is there on the lunar surface with him**. Armstrong's skills, attitude and level-headedness are what made him an ideal candidate to be a commander of an Apollo mission within NASA (although it must be noted that when Armstrong was tapped for Apollo 11, there wasn't a guarantee it would be the FIRST moon-landing flight - the film fudges that).The technical aspects here are well handled including the special effects and Linus Sandgren's cinematography (a combination of 16mm, 35mm & 65mm film), and a joy to see on as big a screen as possible (although the jiggly hand-held nature of the camera operation might be cause to sit a bit further back). The supporting cast are fine, even if they are given little room for well-rounded performances. The one quibble is Justin Hurwitz' score. It zings and soars at times, in almost complete opposition to the somber tone of the rest of the film, which points out one of the conundrum's of FIRST MAN: While it's laudable that the movie is so intimately rendered, there are times it borders on the lugubrious. Yes, by all accounts, Armstrong was an intensely quiet man, but, in his public interviews his pride in his accomplishments were palpable, and there were twinkles in his eyes. He even smiled. Nobody but the fools who demanded more literal 'flag-waving' (usually not having seen the film), should have expected huge displays of emotion from Armstrong, but, a little more personality wouldn't have hurt. While the Just The Facts Mam screenplay is well executed, a few more colorful insights and details would also have fleshed it out***FIRST MAN is a solid entry into the space filmography. It doesn't have the balls out zing of THE RIGHT STUFF, nor the emotional pull of an APOLLO 13, but, it works nicely as an intimate tale all its own. On that score, I believe Neil Armstrong would be proud to be the center of attention - if only for a couple of hours on screen.*Making the brief anti-Apollo program montage (featuring Gil Scott Heron's 'Whitey on the moon' song) stick out even more. It's not that such a protest isn't worth discussing, but, that it literally comes from nowhere in the context of the rest of the 141 minutes** Aldrin is well known for his cantankerous behavior, but, even so, is portrayed a bit too heavy-handily here. The denouement of Armstrong's walk is one of the film's few exaggerations. It almost certainly didn't occur that way.*** The Agena spacecraft Armstrong docked with on Gemini 8 was nicknamed 'The Angry Alligator' by one of the astronauts, for example. The Zero G Force training unit was dubbed 'The Vomit Comet'. Etc.",Null,0,1,26 October 2018
Black Swan," Aronofsky strips SWAN LAKE
","** Mild possible Spoilers ** Early on in Aronofsky's BLACK SWAN, the Choreographer Leroy (played by Vincent Cassell) states that his version of TCHAIKOVSKY's Swan Lake will be 'stripped down' and made 'real'. The Choreographer can be read as a stand-in for Aronofsky's himself. And, for the next hour and 45 minutes or so we see Leroy/Aronofsky strip Swan Lake down.Unfortunately, this leaves a version which is pretty naked itself. Naked in the sense of being thunderingly obvious in it's ambition. Naked in it's use of sensation and razzle-dazzle to mask its flaws. And, quite naked of any real meaning or human feeling.Nude Movement One: Aronofsky has never been one for subtlety, but here the characters stammer with the most bald artiste clichés imaginable. And, did he really have to have a GIANT BLACK SWAN tattoo on Lily's (Mila Kunis) back? Why not just have a giant Monty Python-like arrow point at her from the rafters of the theater? Nude Movement Two: You could say that Aronofsky is following in the footsteps of Ken Russell with some of the over-the-top techniques, but that would be a slam on Russell (who could often attain great heights while simultaneously infuriating the viewer). And, Russell would never have been as boring as during the many rehearsal scenes here.Nude Movement Three: While there have been a lot of folks who have been wowed by the visual pyrothechnics, horror movie motifs and hocus pocus, the film's fatal flaw is that entire thesis of the enterprise is not so much missed, but squashed. Namely, for Nina/The Swan Queen (Natalie Portman) to feel emotion. But, all of the aforementioned Aronofsky 'touches' actually detract from any emotion being felt - by either Nina or the audience. It simply is naked of heartfelt passion. We're told that Nina has changed, but don't believe it.And, quite assuredly, Leroy/Aronofsky has made Swan Lake/Black Swan less 'real'.The positives do include some intriguing performances, and Portman is darn intense in the lead (even if you don't buy the ending). One can't help but wonder why Leroy would entrust such a critical role to Nina (not just in this ballet, but as the kickoff for the troupe's season) if she is so obviously in turmoil. Matthew Libatique's super 16mm photography is nimble, and Clint Mansell (with Matt Dunkley) does a good job of adapting Tchaicovsky's music (though one does wish that, you know, PETER ILYICH TCHAIKOVSKY got primary music credit, not being relegated to the long end credits roll).***************Spoiler******************** And, Aronofsky had better watch out because he's come dangerously close to M.Night Shymalan territory with an ending in back to back films which are tres similar - it worked better in THE WRESTLER",Null,24,54,6 December 2010
The New World," Exquisite if taxing Tone Poem
","Those heading into Terrence Malick's THE NEW WORLD expecting a 'story' will probably soon become bored, if not outright bewildered by his visionary tone poem about the early settling by westerners of Virginia focusing on Pocahontus, John Smith and (to a lesser extent) John Rolfe. Malick's THIN RED LINE similarly used the approach of having several characters' inner thoughts heard as a sort of ghostly voice-over to the events we see. Indeed, without the voice-overs, large sections of the film almost play as they would if they were a Silent Movie. Long dialogue-less sequences with overlapping edits cover large sections of the film. Even critical 'plot points' are cover with simple fades and cuts. It certainly taxes one's patience, especially over the 149 minutes the original version ran/runs (At this writing, a shorter cut was being planned for wide release; a futile effort for it can't be edited to make it a mass appeal film). The film rewards one's patience once the symbolic and poetic structure of the piece comes clear. Indeed, the film's major flaws are precisely WHEN it tries to present a plot or a story. It's as if a non-verbal spell has been broken. Rarely would a screenwriter allow so much of his work be in the hands of his technicians as does Malick (doubtless under his strict control). The Cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki), Production Design (Jack Fisk), Music (James Horner, his best in a long while) etc. are vital to the telling and they all come up aces here. All of these elements come together in an absolutely masterful closing sequence (dialogue-less, naturally).One final note on the Sound for the film (not unexpectedly, brilliant): Malick truly understands the importance of silence and/or sparse precise natural sounds in Cinema. Too often people (even in the business) judge Film Sound on the basis of how MUCH and how LOUD it is, not how it's used creatively.",Null,2,8,3 January 2006
10 Cloverfield Lane," So-So even without the questionable ending
","To discuss 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE without referencing the ending is high near impossible. Suffice it to say for now that the title is a giveaway, and that the finished movie is the result of an original screenplay that has been re-engineered to shoe-horn into an existing franchise. How one feels about that seems to be topic A when discussing it.But, CLOVERFIELD has a number of other issues apart from it's fractured narrative. The whole set-up itself simply comes off as an extended episode of The Twilight Zone - and, a not especially exceptional or original one at that. It's essentially yet another take on a Bomb Shelter/Last Persons On Earth yarn. Further, it echoes the Tim Robbins sequence in Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS. The acting is good, particularly by John Goodman, there are some nice details and a decent enough twist (not the ending, but within the shelter storyline), but they simply aren't enough to sustain interest for a full length feature. By the time we get to the questionable questionable one can't help but look back and ask what was the point of the whole enterprise? The main body of the movie bears precious little impact on what comes next, and that 'twist' comes off as a red herring signifying little beyond a feeling of distaste. Forging ahead carefully about the ending. If the online stories are true about the original ending, I would say that it was better - but, not enough to make the movie actually that much more so. At least it retains the mystery of what happened and plays into the fatalistic tone of the earlier section. The released version certainly is more action-packed, and, yes, does tie-in to it's predecessor - but, makes the main body of the picture even less connected to the overall scheme of things. 90% of the movie seems like a prelude to get to the real tale. A Twilight Zone-like twist without the skill of execution of the best of that TV series.P.S. Why is it that these end of the world 3-ways always seem to be two guys a girl? Kinky writers?",Null,4,9,18 March 2016
It," Stand By Me meets Killer Klowns
","Stephen King has always been adept at depicting the peculiarities of townfolk, especially from a child's POV. The trick in adapting his work is to maintain that adeptness while also, by necessity, doing so without 1,000 pages. This adaptation of IT certainly plunges into the world of the children at the center. These characters are pretty well fleshed out (kudos to the actors, as well). More problematic is how Director Muschietti and his trio of writers treat the horror.Simply put, we never get a sense of the exact nature of the evil. There seems to be no rules as to who lives or dies, why some manifestations are literal and others imaginary, why Pennywise is critical to the malevolence etc.. The filmmakers not only don't have the space of a novel, they also are adapting only half it. In this case, that may have been a perfectly valid plan of action (as is moving the story ahead over a quarter of a century). Still, the compressions do matter. Without knowing the rulebook, there isn't the same degree of suspense (if you don't know why a life is/isn't in danger at a given point in the story you just shrug and wait to find out if this is another hallucination or 'the real thing').Still, this is a pretty intense picture. There's a grim but palpable atmosphere that grabs you from the prologue that carries through to the end. The production design and other tech elements (especially, the sound work) are all fine although Benjamin Wallfisch's score succumbs to the the current mode of overly loud horror soundtracks. As noted, the acting by the young cast is very good and the few adults do fine as well including Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. I understand it is part of King's overall 'evil cursed town' theme, but some of the abuse and bullying gets a bit too much at times (and, without the prose to justify it, often comes off as just mean and ugly).IT is being sold on the Pennywise image. Obviously, he's central, but, a little less would have been more effective. A more subtle and inviting character would pay off as more menacing as 'it' turned. But, subtlety goes out the door with the final two big sequences in the old haunted house. Far too much CGI and ear-piercing surround sound blaring. The quieter moments (particularly amongst the kids) are the ones that work best. Aside from the special effects overkill, the lack of a rulebook also diminishes the climax. A poster for NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET V only adds to the comparison between Freddy Krueger and Pennywise. By Part V, the Elm Street series had long collapsed into self-parody, but, in the original Freddy Krueger had a very specific backstory and reason for being. Stephen King and the IT filmmakers are obviously aiming for something much more metaphysical, but, as a film, Wes Craven's original had a much more cogent and specific evil that made it a much more successful film. IT is okay, but, there was a far better movie that got buried under the welter of SFX and vague storytelling.P.S. I have to make special note of the rock fight scene. WTF??!! Do the filmmakers not understand the difference between a fist-sized rock and snowball? This is one of the most absurd scenes of the year. I know it's in the novel, but, it simply plays differently on the big screen.",Null,2,4,22 September 2017
Hereditary," Intense, disquieting horror thriller gets less interesting as it goes along
","Ari Aster's Directorial debut is an intense, disquieting horror thriller. It commences mainly as straightforward drama with its tale of a dysfunctional family with creepy elements folded in slowly. The death of family matriarch Ellen sets off the chain of events. At the funeral, we are introduced to her daughter Annie (Toni Collette) and her husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) and children, daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) and son Peter (Alex Wolff). The movie builds slowly and steadily, becoming an uncomfortably grueling exercise in family dysfunction. Two specific incidents spark a turn in the story towards horror, one internal, the other external. Even then, Director Aster ratchets up the horror elements at a deliberate pace. Once the machinations get truly revealed is where the story problems coalesce. The build up wounds the viewer into knots, but the payoff gets progressively less and less interesting.I hate to be equivocal, but HERIDITARY is that kind of movie. General audiences who infamously gave the movie a D+ Cinemascore opening night will likely have already emotionally bailed on the movie by the last act, but, even those who hung in there will likely be split by how the movie resolves. Not equivocal is Collette's performance. A performance so good that it lingers even when the movie is, unfortunately, taken largely out of her character's control. Too many coincidences and outside forces have to intervene to drive the plot (not to mention an incredulous lack of interest by the cops and social services). Still, Collette is so strong, she binds the movie even as it spins towards some dubious places. The rest of the cast is fine, including Ann Dowd as a woman Annie meets during a grief counseling session. The audio mix and music provide an atmospheric backdrop. The photography, while well lit and framed, isn't as impressive in its digital rendering (and the less said about the CGI flames, the better). Aster uses a lot of Doll House imagery (Annie is an artist who specializes in that form), but it never truly pays off (again here, some of the Digital photography makes even some of the 'real' settings look like CGI fakery - intentionally or not). In the end, HERIDITARY is a mixed bag. Undoubtedly disturbing on one hand, but, losing control of its narrative on the other. Without delving into spoilers, I will just say that the plot machinations should have remained steadfastly 'All In The Family'. In other words, it should have adhered closely to its very title.",Null,1,2,14 June 2018
Minority Report," The Best SF film in a while, despite a lack of nerve at the end
","I know some of you may not have seen it yet, so I'll try to be vague on some specifics. --Thought this film would have been TWICE as effective if you chop off the last 10 Minutes or so (i.e. When it appears as though Cruise's fate is 'sealed'). A great film where it seemed like they lost their nerve at the end and felt they 'had' to cross every 'T' & dot every 'I' and put a big PERIOD on at the end. Too bad, could have been a classic. --Second Thought. Does anybody else think that if Tom Cruise & Max Von Sydow had switched which characters they were playing, that the final scene would have been re-written so that their character's fates would have been reversed? Again, Spielberg & Cruise seem to have let the box office dictate the plot mechanics.Still think this overall the best SF film in quite a while. Very well done (Kaminski's photography & Williams' music were standouts). Only quibble I had was with the Production Design. While most of the SFX were superb (except for the Merlin the magician look of the operators of the video screens in the lab - all they needed was a wand and a pointy hat), I thought some of the Set Decoration got lazy. I.E. you have all these high tech advances like vertical magnetic field highways, yet the Train looks like the 'T' and the Gap store is just a Gap store with a fancy electronic screen.",Null,0,0,29 July 2002
Training Day," Great first half & performances/slips in end
","Denzel Washington performance has been dubbed Oscar-worthy since the film opened. It is that good. Will the Academy award him the Oscar for such a loathsome character? Probably not. TRAINING DAY opens extremely well. The first half is taut, well-written & directed, with the aforementioned top notch Washington performance. Hawke is fine for most of the film, although occasionally, he seems to be playing the 'rookie' part a little too literally. One still has to believe that the character DID make it through the Police Academy and 19 months on the sometimes very tough streets of the San Fernando Valley (believe me, they ain't all dotted with Starbucks!). Around the 2/3 mark however, I think the film makes a wrong turn and becomes the kind of pro-forma cop/action flick that pervades the 'action' shelf at your local video store. Too bad, it could have said something more profound about the state of police work in modern day big cities (and no matter how 'farfetched' you might think some of the events are, just keep in mind that the LAPD has had just these kinds of scandals). Worth seeing for Washington and a terrific first half, though.",Null,1,11,26 January 2002
Detroit," 'True Story' yet feels false
","I don't criticize the movie on PC or 'racial' grounds, but, on how it works - doesn't - on screen. Unfortunately, the backlast TO the backlash paints just about anybody who doesn't like DETROIT as being PC. I strongly support Bigelow and Boal's 'right' to make any movie they want, but, it's also a person's right to disapprove and not have one's motives questioned. My full take:Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal's THE HURT LOCKER and ZERO DARK THIRTY are two of best movies of the millennium. Because of that, it is doubly difficult to write that their current effort, DETROIT is such a disappointment.The movie takes place during the Detroit riots of July 1967. It begins with a wider overview of the situation, complete with archival news reports, photos and audio.* Interspersed are a few on the ground perspectives of various characters. It's not terribly involving, but not bad. Some of these characters begin to gather in and around a motel. At that point, it becomes clear that the events at that motel will become the centerpiece of the movie.Those events became known as the infamous and horrific Algiers Motel Incident, complete with a contemporaneous best-selling book of that name by John Hersey. It is here where the movie failings emerge. If there is one thing that the various witnesses can agree on - is that there are few things they can agree on. In addition to the book, there were several investigations, court cases and a myriad of stories written and recorded over the four decades since. Bigelow and Boal said they did not use the book when making DETROIT.However, the movie-makers made the decision to depict a single narrative viewpoint as if it were 'the truth'. While the incident may not have exactly been a Rashomon situation, it was certainly a chaotic one where no one person was witness to each and every event that happened along the way. That is Bigelow and Boal's artistic decision. But, it becomes disastrous if not downright distateful on screen. For, despite fine performances and strong production values, the sequence never quite rings true. It seems Written. Directed. Coerced. Co-Opted. Manufactured. It's a 'true story' that feels false. Without truth. Without insight. The brutality and inhumanity is so unremitting that it takes on the feel of an exploitation movie. I fully understand that exploitation was the last thing on Bigelow and Boal's mind, but the screen does not lie. Yes, these incidents did happen, but did we need to see all the blood,bruising and nudity? It further complicates things that DETROIT's narrative of the events is contradicted by much of the sworn testimony of the witnesses - both at the time and subsequently**. Again, Bigelow and Boal's artistic perogative, but to what end if not to further belief in the portrayal of events??DETROIT's last act is a long protracted court-room drama. It's supposed to bring context and some closure to the events, but, like the bulk of the movie it feels wholly unsatisfactory and unfullfilling. Whenever a 'true story' about barbarous events is brought to the screen by such a clearly talented cast and crew the term 'powerful' is often used (indeed, there were several audible gasps in the screening I attended). But, a production can be both 'powerful' and 'empty'. DETROIT, unfortunately, ends up on the lower end of that scale.* Kudos to Bigelow for preserving the proper aspect ratio for the vintage footage** Without getting into spoilers, I will just mention a relatively minor example. The musical band portrayed in the movie, The Dramatics, are depicted as newbies who are seeking a first break. In actuality, they had been together for four years and even been a recording act for at least two years Prior to the events in DETROIT. I don't criticize Boal & Bigelow's movie because of a few fudged facts, but, because it undercuts the drama even further, making it feel false.",Null,26,44,16 August 2017
A Star Is Born," Okay version of the familiar story
","A STAR IS BORN - Officially, this is the 4th version of the oft-told tale, but, it's more directly a re-do of the 1976 Streisand edition (all three prior versions get credit). It's a familiar story of a rise and fall of a musician/actor/painter/author etc. With Lady Gaga as the riser and Bradley Cooper as the fallen (curiously, the movie never truly makes clear how successful Cooper's character's career is when the story begins). As clichéd as the plot is (oh, and there's a welter of them), there's enough innate charm with Gaga's Ally that it carries the picture through the rough patches and dull sections. While Gaga has charisma, and, obviously, on-stage talent, her acting is passable at best. She's most comfortable when just being a natural, but, when the movie demands more of her during the more heavily dramatic scenes, it surpasses her abilities (a couple of times you can even catch her consciously 'hitting her mark'). Cooper's Jack is so obviously a nod to Kris Kristofferson's John Howard from the 70s version that it hampers his acting (it's doubly amusing because the movie makes several references to Jack's 'voice' being indebted to his brother Bobby (Sam Elliott)). Cooper fares best in the last act. After some awkwardly bumpy scenes, Elliott's performance may be this version's best. Cooper's Direction gets the job done, but, the use of close-ups is excessive, carrying on into scenes where such tight framing isn't needed. Matthew Libatique's cinematography is so sharp and brightly lit that you can see the makeup caked on Gaga's face (digital photography will do that if not careful), although he achieves some fine visuals elsewhere. The new STAR IS BORN is an adequate enough production. But, the fact that it and Lady Gaga are being touted for Best Picture and Actress says a lot about the current state of the cinema.",Null,1,3,10 October 2018
Wind River," Decent crime drama with by SICARIO screenwriter
","Taylor Sheridan has written a pair of the more hard-hitting dramas of recent years in HELL OR HIGH WATER and SICARIO. HELL's was fine enough that it was worthy of the Oscar it was nominated for (and Best Picture, too, IMHO). With WIND RIVER, Sheridan steps behind the camera to direct as well. Like SICARIO and HELL, it's a crime drama set in desolate area (here an Indian Reservation in Wyoming). Loosely based on true events, it involves solving the gruesome freezing death of a young woman, a game tracker who discovers the body (Jeremy Renner), an FBI agent assigned to the case (Elizabeth Olson) and the local Native American cop (Grahame Green). Renner, Greene and Gil Birmingham (as the grieving father) are all superb. Unfortunately, Olson never quite strikes the right note as the FBI agent. She plays the 'fish out of water' motif far too obviously. And, like Emily Blunt's Kate in SICARIO, the character veers dangerously close to being a female pinata for all the testosterone in the movie. Sheridan's screenplay, while solid, also betrays his tendency to overstate things best left to the viewer to decipher.WIND RIVER is a decent B movie with higher ambitions. Sheridan the Director doesn't contribute much beyond shaky cam and doesn't display the assuredness of SICARIO's Villenueve or HELL's MacKenzie. It's not up to the prior two movies, but, still a worthy watch.",Null,0,4,20 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," Ianucci's dark farce on the last days of Stalin
","In the first moments of Armando Ianucci's DEATH OF STALIN it blows past satire into being an out and out farce. Ianucci is best known for creating HBO's Veep as well as his scathing 2009 movie IN THE LOOP. Both have their farcical elements, but STALIN takes it a step further in Ianucci's take on the last days of the Russian tyrant in 1953. The fine cast that Ianucci has assembled doesn't even try to mask their native accents with the mostly British cast mouthing all their dialogue is seemingly the most exaggerated way possible, including Paddy Considine and an always welcome Michael Palin (his inclusion in the cast brings to mind not only Monty Python, but, also Gilliam's BRAZIL). American actors Steve Buscemi and Jeffrey Tambor do the same. In a perverse touch, only Olga Kurylenko sounds out of place using her natural voice! Based on a play of the same name, and having begun production over three years ago, Ianucci couldn't have intended all of the resonances with today's situation with Russia and the West (although it was certainly on that path). Predictably, Putin has banned the movie from being shown in the country where it is set.While it can hardly be termed an accurate portrayal of the events surrounding Stalin's passing, it gets enough correct to give it a ring of truth. More importantly, it does so with some rich humor, that however broad, also lands some direct hits. How amusing one finds it will likely depend not only a suspension of disbelief, but, also if one can see the absurdity of the comedy amidst the very real and nasty history of the Stalin regime. Knockabout buffoonery often plays side by side with images of political prisoners being rounded and up and even killed. Were it not for Ianucci's deft writing and directing, and the large talented cast, it indeed could be deemed distasteful. But, then again, shouldn't great humor be a bit dangerous? In the end, STALIN isn't as successful as IN THE LOOP. The targets can be vague, and parts of it descend into burlesque with more than a few bits falling flat. But, overall, DEATH OF STALIN is another darkly witty entry by Ianucci. 
P.S. SPOILERSAgain, STALIN was begun three years ago, but, it's hard not to draw parallels between Putin and a combination of Beria (Simon Russell Beale) and Zhukov (Jason Isaccs), with a nod towards the eventual victor in the struggle in Khrushchev (Buscemi). And, if it's a bit of stretch to associate Malenkov (Tambor) to President Trump, he's certainly a stand in for the toothless Medvedev.",Null,3,5,12 March 2018
Darkest Hour," Oldman's performance carries this historical drama
","Gary Oldman IS Winston Churchill. That seems to have been the selling point for DARKEST HOUR since it went into production. Premiering at Telluride, the word was that this could finally be the one that brings Oldman an Oscar. That is to be seen.It's not all Oldman, of course. Director Joe Wrigth seems to have an affinity for period pictures, so one would think that this WWII drama would fit well. Unfortunately, it's a bit of an unsteady ride - much like Churchill's term as Prime Minister. Beginning just before Churchill's rise to power, DARKEST HOUR trains its focus on how he manages a thicket of opposition - from ousted P.M. Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup), from much of his own party (chiefly Viscount Halifax; Stephen Dillane) to even King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) while trying to stave off what seems like the imminent Nazi conquest of England.Anthony McCarten's screenplay certainly stacks the deck in making it appear as though it was Churchill versus everybody else (and fudges other significant facts). Everybody else but his loyal, but strong wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) and his loyal secretary (Hannah Steele). Fortunately, Oldman is up to the task of carrying the burden. It's a big blustery scene-chewing performance just set on a tee for awards consideration. Oldman mostly carries it off under all the makeup, even, if some of the supposedly 'amusing' backstage scenes come off as a drunken Alfred Hitchcock performing on Monty Python. When he's allowed to play it straight, he dominates the screen.Unfortunately, Director Wright seemed to have a bit different idea of doing a historical drama. Instead of remaining largely invisible in his direction, we get swirling stylistic 'touches' that detract, more than engage. Sometimes it seems as if Wright instructed Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel to make his camera into a giant wind-up toy and let it roam free. Dario Marinelli's score is perfunctory.DARKEST HOUR is modestly effective for Oldman's performance. It's a rousing old fashioned tale, even if it isn't perfectly told.",Null,3,8,1 December 2017
Memento," OK, but too clever for its own good
","Come on, folks. As I write this, MEMENTO is listed as the 9th BEST FILM OF ALL TIME? Yeah, right. I'm not going to come down too hard on this, but this is one of those films which is so concerned with how cleverly it tricks the audience (6TH SENSE, USUAL SUSPECTS) that it inevitably will be a let down when all the plot mechanics are revealed as a giant ruse. Not to say that clever plotting is bad, but the final results have to be a revelation - or carry a deeper resonance (i.e. THE CONVERSATION, Godard's LA CHINOISE or Bunuel's masterpiece BELLE DE JOUR) not just a cheap cinematic trick. Check out Nolan's FOLLOWING for a better, less cynical, treatment of a similar theme.",Null,2,3,14 October 2001
Passengers," Better than expected
","a tough one to discuss without spoilers. They will be below and clearly tagged.In general, I thought the movie was better than the reviews. The acting is fine with a limited cast (mainly Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence). The production design and music are very good (both Oscar nominated), as is Rodrigo Prieto's camera-work (he's nominated for SILENCE). The premise is intriguing if not highly original (apparently Harlan Ellison has complained; and others have cited antecedents). The basic idea is that a crew of 5,200 people is in hibernation on a 120 year journey to another planet. By accident, Pratt's character Jim gets awoken - 90 years early! And, later, so does Lawrence's (Aurora). But, the crux of the movie is a major moral dilemma which pops up about a third of the way into the movie (discussed below). For the most part it is handled well enough. Unfortunately, the last act dashes much of that goodwill, if not entirely. So, if you haven't seen it, then it's worth a look for sci-fi fans. Others beware.SPOILERS: The turning point of the movie is when Jim makes the choice to manually awaken Aurora because he is alone and knows he will likely die that way long before reaching the other planet. He becomes smitten with her after reading her profile in the ship's logs (really!). And, that's where the movie falls apart for most people. By waking her up, he essentially dooms her to the same fate as he. And, of course, he assumes they will become a 'desert island' couple. It's certainly a moral dilemma. But, I think the script, for the most part, addresses the issues. But, others can't get over Jim's actions, and have taken to calling his character a selfish bastard all the way up to a sexual predator. I don't argue with critics on the film about their attitude towards Jim, but, I do defend Screenwriter John Spaihts (DR.STRANGE), Director Morten Tyldum (IMITATION GAME) and the cast for how they play out the situation. There's nothing wrong with depicting a morally dubious decision. In fact, that is the primary drama here. It's really not that far different from what they did in numerous episodes of The Twilight Zone, for instance. But, now, our judgmental social media zealots won't even entertain that debate. Now, the last act? That I won't and can't defend. It is very much a 'Hollywood Ending' that invites and deserved ridicule. Apparently, Spaiht's original script (which was in much demand during its 10 year development), handled things a bit differently.",Null,3,4,26 January 2017
Us," Interesting if too convoluted
","For all it virtues, Jordan Peele's GET OUT's greatest strength may have been its strong focus on getting from its creepy beginning to its finale. All of the social commentary, humor and production values seemed determined to arrive at that conclusion (fumbled a bit, but, that's a different discussion). With US, Peele has chosen a much more indirect route. The end goal may have been clear to Peele, but, the path is much rockier.
Give Peele kudos for ambition. US is chock-full of subplots, subtext and, even a bit of genuine subversion. The basic gimmick seems simple enough. A young girl Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) walks into a funhouse in 1986 and exits a scared and scarred victim of a frightful appearance. Cut to the present and the now adult Adelaide and her husband and two children are going on vacation near that same fateful funhouse. Audiences conditioned by horror films can start to guess what is going to happen next, but Peele continues to toss in curve balls and sliders as US flits from childhood terrors to home invasion thriller to Invasion Of The Body Snatchers riff to Zombie flick.
By the time we get to the conclusion, the audience may be forgiven for feeling a bit worn out, not just by the longish running time (110 minutes), but, by the twisty path US takes to get to the not altogether satisfying conclusion. What keeps the movie afloat is the fine acting by Nyong'o, Elisabeth Moss and Shahadi Wright Joseph (as Adelaide's daughter). Peele stages much of the action well and the other tech credits are solid. While there isn't the deeper vein of humor as found in GET OUT, Peele sneaks in a few choice bits in the margins.
To Peele's credit, he has never been shy about acknowledging his inspirations in his work, whether it be The Stepford Wives for GET OUT, or the Twilight Zone episode 'Mirror Image' here (Peele's revamp of Twilight Zone has just begun airing). Some may also see not only the influence of the aforementioned Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, but, also THE STRANGERS, GREMLINS and even the semi-obscure British horror film DEATH LINE (aka Raw Meat). All filmmakers borrow, of course. Unfortunately, sections of US feel like an undigested collections of themes, storylines and plot points. Without getting into spoilers, I'll just state that the more one thinks about it, the less the basic premise makes sense. Peele tries the trick of avoiding direct explanation of what the hell is going on, but, there's enough there to notice that it doesn't add up.
It is too easy to say that US is Peele's 'sophomore slump'. It's better than that, but, it's still a bit of disappointment.
If nothing else, US answers the question of what an early David Cronenberg (70s era) remake of Penny Marshall/Tom Hank's BIG would have been like!",Null,0,1,3 April 2019
Ready Player One," A Film about Pop Icons by a Pop Icon
","The notion of pairing a film about Pop Icons with a Director who is himself one (not to mention creating much of the iconography within the story-line) should, in theory, have resulted in either something grand or a fascinating disaster. But, as with much of Spielberg's work over the past decade or more, it ends up landing softly in between.  The plot is pretty simple even with all the high tech diversions. In the future (2045), an eccentric Game Developer Halliday (Mark Rylance, fine as always) has created the ultimate VR world where we are told millions chose to spend much of their 'waking' hours - Oasis. When Halliday passes on, he leaves behind the ultimate 'Easter Egg' - solve three clues, and you can inherit the rights to Oasis. Halliday is like a kinder, friendlier combination of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg (complete with elbowing out his co-founder Morrow (Simon Pegg). Our young hero Wade (Tye Sheridan) and heroine Samantha (Olivia Cooke) use their knowledge of Halliday and Oasis to try and decipher the riddle. Coming up against them is a generic corporate baddie Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). Of course, a film like this isn't about the plot as much as it is about the visuals and effects, and, ever the pro, Spielberg has assembled a talented team to pull those off admirably. His long-time Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski shot as much of the movie on film as feasible, but, with all the CGI parts were digitally captured and rendered. I saw it on 70mm film and it looked very good even if a movie about VR isn't the best usage of the medium. And, of course, much of the joy/task of watching R.P.O. will be a game of 'Spot The Pop Culture Reference'! Many of the images are so densely packed that it is impossible to see them on all in one viewing. This is one Blu Ray/Stream that will re-watched over and over by many.There is fun to be had with R.P.O. even if it never truly takes off. The cast is game. The concept is understandable, and the payoff is suitably well delivered. But, without being ageist - this is very much a film from an older man's perspective. All the 80s and 90s references are explained as being from Halliday's childhood, but, it certainly doesn't help make the movie seem any less an exercise in half-baked nostalgia. Would kinds two decades from now really find pop culture artifacts from 65 years earlier to be the hippest thing on earth (and, in the case of Harryhausen's Cyclops - nearly 90 years)!?? A few more nods to the 21st century would have been nice. Couldn't the bland white middle-aged evil Sorrento have been a woman? A minority? A robot? But, this plays very plays like a movie that could have been made in the 80s if CGI technology had existed. As one friend said, it's like a Spielberg 80s movie - not one he Directed, but that he produced -- i.e. BACK TO THE FUTURE, THE GOONIES, *batteries not included etc.. Instead of his usual composer John Williams, we get Zemeckis fave Alan Silvestri who contributes another of his 2nd rate Jerry Goldsmith-like scores.READY PLAYER ONE is a decent diversion. Spielberg is such a master that even when he outright fails (B.F.G., HOOK), his professionalism never allows them to be truly awful. And, maybe, that's a problem with his more recent work. If you don't take big risks, you rarely achieve greatness. R.P.O. isn't bad, but, it's oh so safe.",Null,1,3,1 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," Unconventional Bio-Pic
","Director Craig Gillespie's I, TONYA is an unconventional Bio-Pic - so unconventional that the term itself doesn't really apply. Part-Mockumentary, Part-Drama and Part-Dark Satire, TONYA gives us a cracked version of Tonya Harding's life and and the events surrounding the knee-capping of Nancy Kerrigan in the week's leading up to the 1994 Winter Olympics. TONYA contains not one, but several, unreliable narrators lead by Tonya herself (Margo Robbie), her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) and Tonya's estranged mom LaVona (Allison Janney). The movie is framed with faux interviews with them (and others) - often speaking straight to the camera (a convention which also occurs within scenes in the movie). But, make no mistake, Gillespie and Screenwriter Steve Rogers very much favor Tonya's POV here. It's her slant on the story that takes center ice. The movie works as well as it does because of the cast and the lure of the lurid true story. Robbie looks nothing like Harding despite hours of makeup (this is made clear when we see clips of the real Harding), but, she enthusiastically takes on the role, giving it a grit and energy that keeps the movie on balance despite some significant bumps along the way. Stan and Paul Walter Hauser (as Gilooly's henchman Shawn Eckhardt) are also fine. More problematic is Janney's LaVona. Janney is a superb actress, but, here she is so over the top that she verges on being a cartoon (unsurprisingly, the real LaVona Golden wasn't interviewed by the filmmakers, so it is little wonder than she comes off the worst of the major characters).  The contrivance of an unreliable narrator isn't a bad concept, but, too often I, TONYA ends up feeling unreliable itself. Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) is very much shunted to the background (and only utters one word, 'Why!??'). To believe I, TONYA you'd think that Kerrigan was some rich Ice Queen in contast to the working class Harding. The truth is that Kerrigan's family was also working class (the Dad working three jobs to pay for her training). It's understood that the movie is from Harding's perspective, but, at a certain point, you have to wonder about the movie's overall authenticity. Matters aren't helped by a certain reluctance on the part of the filmmakers to have dramatic scenes play out. There is some very nasty physical and sexual abuse on display, but, they are often undercut with a wink, a retro song (often not very good selections) or a quip directly at the camera. It's as if the filmmakers are saying to the viewer, 'Yes, some bad stuff happened, but, hey, here's a funny aside - you're still having fun and enjoying the movie, ain't ya?!' And, some of the mugging for the camera makes it seem like the cast is auditioning for an off-Broadway production of an early Coen Brothers film. Despite some major qualms, I, TONYA refreshingly breaks the mold of a Bio-Pic. It's simply too bad that the filmmakers couldn't find a consistent and more thoughtful tone.",Null,5,9,13 December 2017
Molly's Game," Less a dramatic movie than an illustrated Podcast
","If you ever wanted to know what a video illustrated Podcast would be like -- then MOLLY'S GAME is the movie for you. Jessica Chastain stars and narrates as Molly Bloom, a former Olympic skier who found herself as a Poker madam who ran ultra-high stakes underground gambling games in L.A. and New York. The high priced events attracted Hollywood celebrities, wealthy financiers, baseball players and the mob. Chastain/Bloom narrates and narrates and narrates. When not narrating, we are given picayune details on gambling, the law, what exact drinks are being served and the ins and out of skiing. Chastain is a wonderful actress, but, she doesn't possess the most proficient narration voice. But, of course, the real 'voice' here is not the actresses, but writer (and first time) director Aaron Sorkin's. It's all very much delivered in his trademark fast rhythms and idiosyncrasies. Sorkin should have just cut out the middle-man and done the narration himself. 
 
 Sorkin is obviously a gifted writer, but, Sorkingthe DIRECTOR fails him here. In the past, fine filmmakers like David Fincher, Danny Boyle and Mike Nichols knew that as good as the writing is, you also have to show the audience what is happened. Instead, we are told what has happened, what is happened and what will happen. We are told what the characters are not only thinking, but what they are about to do. The effect is suffocating. The viewer is given little to chance to take a breath, let alone enjoy the drama.  What makes the Direction so unfortunate, is that the true story of Molly Bloom is inherently interesting. Along with Chastain (who delivers a solid performance despite it all), there are fine actors like Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Michael Cera, Graham Greene and many others in the cast. But, Sorkin's over-reliance on narration squelches the drama. Oddly, about 3/4 of the way through the 140 minute movie, the narration subsides substantially. Almost two hours in - and we suddenly shift into what resembles a normal motion picture. Those final scenes may not be great, but, at least one can appreciate what the actors are doing without being told in advance every nuance. 
 
 Finally, there's Sorkin's well known disdain for keeping to the facts of the true story. The central metaphor for the movie how Bloom had a tragic accident that ended her career sending her life into disorder. But, the real Molly Bloom never had a Wide World of Sports style 'agony of defeat' fall. Sorkin pulled it out his ass. Nobody is dumb enough to believe that a Hollywood movie with big stars is going to tell the full unvarnished truth, but Sorkin is a serial abuser. Instead of the usual movie disclaimer: 'Although based on a true story, some events and characters have been changed for dramatic purposes' - Sorkin's disclaimer should read: 'This is fiction, but, but some true events have been included to sell this to the public'. Also, Bloom did not have a tough but powerful black Attorney by her side with a cute precocious child (which just so happens to closely mirror the young Molly Bloom who - you guessed it! - was also a cute precocious child).  Much of this wouldn't matter so much if MOLLY'S GAME worked better as a movie. Unfortunately, it's all tell without much show.",Null,63,91,7 January 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Very much SPIKE LEE's take on Ron Stallworth's amazing true story
","Despite being based on a true story, and having three other credited screenwriters (plus, a book), this is very much SPIKE LEE's Blackkklansman (note also the added K which is not on the book). The basics of detective Ron Stallworth's memoir are still at play. Detective Stallworth (John David Washington) was the first black office hired in Colorado Springs in the 1970s. Stallworth did 'join' the KKK and carried on conversations with them. When the time came for a face-to-face meeting, a white officer here called Zimmerman (played by Adam Driver; although the real Stallworth has kept his true identity secret). Together they infiltrated the local Klan and helped foil some of their racist deeds. Spike Lee does a decent job with the main storyline, although, it can come off as a bit dry and overlong. Clearly, the mundane details didn't engage Lee's filmmaking juices. So, with the other screenwriters, the story is embellished. Stallworth's girlfriend Patrice (Laura Harrier) isn't just a local, but, now she's the head of the local Black Student Union - and, ta da! -- now a chief target of the local KKK. Zimmerman isn't just white, he's now also Jewish - AND, has problems with his identity as such. There isn't just racism in the police force, but, there's also a singularly hateful specimen named Landers (Frederick Weller) who is ripe for a comeuppance. Astonishingly, the most 'unbelievable' part of the film is actually TRUE -- Stallworth did strike up a correspondence with KKK Grand Wizard David Duke (Topher Grace; excellent) AND did get assigned to protect the bigot when he came to town! Nobody expects to see a Documentary when you go to a Hollywood treatment of a true story, and every viewer will have to decide for themselves if and/or to what extent the liberties taken here go too far. Most are somewhat understandable, but one is kind of a head-scratcher -- moving the story from 1979 to 1972. Stokely Carmichael (aka Kwame Ture)'s speech in town was in '72 and , yes, Stallworth did cover it as a cop. Perhaps, Spike also wanted to set the story closer to the 60s civil right protests, the height of the Black Panthers and to include his fun tribute to Blaxploitation cinema (although, it renders references to COFFY and CLEOPATRA JONES as anachronisms since they came out a year later)? BLACKKKLANSMAN still stirs. It's full of Spike's righteous anger and that clearly inspired him. Some of the Spike-isms go a bit far with the lampooning of the local KKK members as Southern Style racist goons (you'd swear those characters were 'imported' from David Duke's South into the Midwestern Colorado locale). He also can't help but take a virtual highlighting marker to references to President Trump -- and, that's AFTER said references were already underlined, to boot (the word 'subtle' is rarely mentioned in the same sentence with'Spike Lee'). The cross-cutting of the Klan watching BIRTH OF A NATION with a talk by Harry Belafonte (grand) is powerful if far too long. The acting is across the board fine, but Adam Driver falls flat. Driver has been solid in pictures like PATERSON and WHILE WE'RE YOUNG, but, as in the Star Wars films he can fall into a dull monotone. It's also hard to believe that the Klansman would take him in as one of their own. He simply doesn't pass the Redneck test (fellow cop Jimmy (Michael Buscemi) would have been far more credible. The cinematography by Chayse Irvin (on 35mm film, which does give it a gritty 70s feel) is quite good. Terence Blanchard's score is adequate, but the soundtrack is carried by the period songs. Released the same weekend as the anniversary of the white supremacists killing of civil rights protester Heather Hyer gives BLACKKKLANSMAN yet another contemporary resonance. The actual footage of which may have been more appropriate after the closing credits, but, that's a quibble. It's a powerful coda to a very angry, if inconsistent, film.",Null,9,20,14 August 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," McDonagh's high wire act mostly works lead by McDormand
","Writer-Director Martin McDonagh's THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE E.M. is one of the true high wire acts of the year. It's a dark farce that treads the line from serious drama to satire to some low rent buffoonery that might not make the cut on a mediocre sit-com. For the most part, it works, propelled by a profanely powerhouse performance by Frances McDormand.McDormand plays a grieving mother (Mildred) who's daughter was killed in a particularly gruesome manner. Fed up with police inaction, she buys three billboards calling out the force. Add in choral music and stark locations and photography and the viewer thinks at the start that they may be in for some heavy going. And then Mildred opens her mouth - and, boy does she! Add in an idiot patrolman played by Sam Rockwell (Dixon), a goofy billboard salesman (Caleb Landry Jones), the local 'midget' (Peter Dinklage) and other assorted colorful locals and that first impression is upended. To his credit, McDonagh continues to defy one's expectations all the way to the delicious epilogue. Adding further support are a wry Woody Harrelson as the Sheriff, and Lucas Hedges and John Hawkes as McDormand's son and ex-husband, respectively. A sense of humor is maintained no matter how dire the situation and that will be a challenge for some viewers. McDonagh doesn't always succeed. Some of the actions and situations go too far even for satire. McDonagh, an Englishman, sometimes muffs the dialogue and characterizations. He knows his targets, but, sometimes his aim is off just enough to mark him as an outsider.THREE BILLBOARDS is an angry comedy. But, one where that rage feels right for the times.",Null,3,6,12 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," One Last Look At My Friends
","The Dead Speak! the opening crawl proclaims. And, do they ever. Not only Emperor Palpatine, but just about every beloved character in the Star Wars canon makes some appearance or is referenced in one way or another (I said 'beloved', so no Jar Jar Binks that I could spot!). In one case, Carrie Fisher's, the 'resurrection' is literal, and somewhat creepy, in using extant footage (along with CGI and body doubles) to rope Princess Leia into the proceedings.Still, the most important re-appearance here is George Lucas. While the father of the Star Wars universe wasn't apparently intimately involved with TROS, he was 'consulted'. Simply put, JJ Abrams and writer Chris Terrio are more in tune with Lucas' vision than Rian Johnson and THE LAST JEDI team were. That, of course, is a double-edged sword for LAST JEDI split the Star Wars fan-verse almost as deeply as Lucas' Prequels did.What works in TROS are the same things that have always worked in Star Wars - heroic acts, derring do action, great special effects...and John Williams' music. What doesn't work here is the storytelling. A jumble of half-baked ideas, simplistic plots that nevertheless confuse, and a general lack of firm purpose outside of wrapping the damn thing up. In the end, Abrams, Terrio and 'Disney' settle on fan service above all else.Daisy Ridley has developed into a decent actress, even if she gets to mostly just look 'determined'. Adam Driver is more animated than usual, and his role has the closest thing to an arc here. The other main actors do their best with their compressed parts here, although Kelli Marie Tran's Rose is given noticeable short shrift. Ian McDiarmid chews the scenery as Palpatine. The main notable newcomer is the always valuable Richard E. Grant. But, it is Billy Dee Williams in a larger role than expected that is a pleasant surprise (even if his performance isn't vigorous).With a trilogy that has had many hands involved, it's no surprise that TROS hasn't a firmer direction, so when in doubt, it reverts to the past. If THE FORCE AWAKENS patterned itself on A NEW HOPE (aka STAR WARS (1977)), then TROS conspicuously takes its blueprint from RETURN OF THE JEDI (with a pinch of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK). Many ideas and concepts introduced in FORCE and LAST are either largely ignored if not downright contradicted.All that seemed to matter here is that the majority of the fan base is appeased. And, speaking as one who saw A NEW HOPE the very first weekend it opened wide in 1977 -- it does on a basic level. Great filmmaking it is not, but, like REVENGE OF THE SITH it rises to the occasion, if barely. Neither of the two latest Trilogies is up to the level of the original, but, SITH and now TROS are, respectively, the most satisfying on a primal basis. Hearing John Willams' exit music, my eyes were a bit misty. Not because I had seen a great film, but, as C3PO (Anthony Daniels) says at one point: 'Taking one last look, sir.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better, but still stagnant & disappointing
","Yes, it is better than Episode 1. But, this is still a very stagnant (exposition heavy) and disappointing film (SOMETIMES, you just can't put that old magic jeanie back in the bottle). The STAR WARS series has become the souless creation of a man, Lucas, who's spent too much time with his electronic toys and not enough in the 'real world'. This is no better exemplified by the 'I'm Lost here' look in Samuel L. Jackson & Natalie Portman's eyes. As to the digital projection aspect. I am shocked at how few people have commented on how 'digital' the film looks. Visible resolution lines, digital smearing, pixellation, subtitles which look like they have 'stripes' jagging through the white lettering, and obvious contrast problems when Very Dark & Very Bright elements in the same frame co-exist. I know 90% of the general public don't notice (or care) about such things. But, it still looks like TV blown up large. Admittedly, scan lines and resolution will continue to get better, but it Digital ain't there yet. I also found that when I saw PERFECT STORM & OCEAN'S 11 (the latter at the very same screen as I saw Lucas' folly) digitally projected, they both looked a little better than CLONES. I think having a Digitally-shot AND Digitally-projected feature just doubles the inherent problems of the new medium. And, then, there's the matter of analog vs. digital sound...",Null,2,5,12 July 2002
Bird Box," Mediocre apocalypse tale
","Even if it didn't come out in the same year as A QUIET PLACE, the similar, if to be fair, based on a prior book, Susanne Bier's BIRD BOX would still be a disappointing effort. Replacing sound with vision as the sensory device, BIRD BOX falls firmly in line with a long line of apocalyptic survivor tales, complete with the small isolated group of fellow 'survivors' who end up battling each other as much as the outside force.The major issues here are less about familiarity and cliches (although there are plenty), but, with the movie's lack of forward momentum. The strict flashback structure actually lessens the impact, rather than enhances it (not to mention that it treats the audience as if they have to been spoonfed each and every detail). The cast is game, lead by Sandra Bullock, Trevante Rhodes and John Malkovich, but, it's an unsympathetic and uninteresting lot (Malkovich is the only one seemingly enjoying himself, even if he could do this one note role in his sleep). Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is serviceable, if undistinguished -- as is Salvatore Totino's lensing. BOX may have fewer overt gaping plot holes than QUIET, but on virtually every other count the Blunt-Krasinski film is superior.BIRD BOX has a few effective moments and a couple of striking individual shots, but, it never adds up to much more than a humdrum addition to the end of the world filmmography; Certainly, nothing worthy of a project pairing a Director with a Best Foreign Film Oscar under her belt (IN A BETTER WORLD) with an Oscar winning actress (not to mention Malkovich).",Null,1,3,29 December 2018
Watchmen," WATCHMEN - review of the movie and only the movie
","I haven't read the graphic novel, so I went into this as purely a movie to be viewed as a work unto itself.It has ideas. Weighty ones. Ones that most blockbusters these days don't even attempt. It took courage not to 'update' the story to the present and to nix Nixon (who, despite FROST/NIXON, is very far removed from the core audience, much more so than in the mid-80s when it was written).I liked it's look for the most part. The effects were good, but nowhere near as spectacular as many would have it. But, to the uninitiated, it's an underwhelming mess. I can see why this has divided audiences and critics. Those familiar with the graphic novel or just ready to groove with the effects and action seem to have liked it, but others have been mixed. I am in the second camp. The Dr. Manhatten storyline works in the main, and Jackie Earle Haley is the best thing in the film as Rorschach (though, at times, his part of the tale seems to come from a different place than the rest). But, the biggest problem, dramatically. are the performances of Malin Ackerman and Patrick Wilson. Dan, I assume is trying be diffident, but Wilson's performance just doesn't work. Ackerman fills out her suit nicely, but it all falls apart once she begins to speak. Their scenes together are performed like something that would appear in a straight to DVD release, not a huge studio film. And, the makeup on Ackerman is so caked on (even when not in costume) that you swear there would layers like rings on a tree if you scraped her face. Even that makeup job is better than the laughably poor 'old age' appliances on Carla Gugino! Crikey, the comical Katherine Helmond plastic surgery makeup in BRAZIL looks more realistic!But, as I noted, I didn't find the film totally without merit. But, ON FILM, WATCHMEN doesn't work. I also hadn't read V FOR VENDETTA, ROAD TO PERDITION or A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE and they were all good to very good FILMS. The key is not to be ultra faithful to the source (as many are applauding WATCHMEN for being), but to find a way to make the source material work dramatically on film - even to those who hadn't read the original material. WATCHMEN fails that test.******* SPOILERS***************I understand that the ending is different in the novel. Here, you can't help but shake the notion that it would be a matter of a few months (a couple of years at the most), when nations would go back to being as they were before. Besides, if Dr.Manhatten is in 'another galaxy' what exactly is the threat that would bind nations?",Null,6,12,28 March 2009
The Village," Shyamalan Has Cornered himself in his 'twist'-trap
","First the good news: Bryce Howard is very good in her first starring role . Roger Deakins' photography continues to amaze (how he doesn't have an Oscar on his shelf is a shame).The rest, I fear, is bad. Very bad. For if this weren't a major studio release by someone of Shyamalan's track record, this is straight-to-video stuff. Ridiculous, dull, pseudo-serious and a major cop-out.The film would have failed under its own weight regardless, but it is becoming clear that Shyamalan has fallen into a trap of his own making with his now patented 'Twist Ending' mandate. A former master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, once stated that audiences were becoming so keen on spotting Hitchcock's portly figure in his cameos, that they were distracted from paying attention to the film (and therefore, Hitchcock made his appearances sooner and sooner to the start of the film).And now, I fear, a similar thing is happening to Shyamalan's films. Audiences are so cued into the inevitable 'twist ending' that they are hunting for clues from the start of the film so they can maybe guess what it may be (Is Bryce Howard 'blind' for a reason? Who was the first to spot the red plants? Why is Adrien Brody grinning all the time? It must all 'mean' SOMETHING!). It stops the film dead in its tracks. Of course, if it weren't for the fact that the last 3 films' 'twists' all were fairly mundane doesn't help matters. But, the important point is that Shyamalan break away from this repetitious trap and make films that follow a plot and its characters straight to its conclusion - even a (shudder the thought) PREDICTABLE ending! Otherwise, Shyamalan may be in danger of becoming the William Castle of his generation (without Castle's sense of fun).",Null,0,1,6 September 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not awful, just pointless and unnecessary. Worst Film Score In Years!
","Finally saw T3 (and I didn't pay - don't want to help Arnold in his threatened race for Gov!).Brings to mind the whole topic of sequels. Expectations play such a large part. Taken on its own, T3 is an OK mishmash of the first 2 films. BUT, coming after a pair of the most influential SF films of the past 2 decades, it's a big letdown. Especially, considering that this wasn't a quickie B-Movie throwaway like in the old days of THE MUMMY'S HAND, HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, REVENGE OF THE CREATURE, RETURN OF THE FLY etc. There, you're expectations weren't as high (as well as the financial stakes, so sometimes you were pleasantly surprised at the outcome - ESCAPE FROM PLANET OF THE APES or FUTUREWORLD being a prime examples).The money (reportedly over $100M to $150M) is there on screen, but the IDEAS of the first 2 films take a big backseat to MORE Explosions, MORE Action, MORE chases and MORE bad puns. Sorry, but the supposed 'wit' I kept hearing about fell mostly flat to me and the audience I saw it with (except for one yahoo who hooted and hollered on cue as if on the payroll of WB). Too much of the script simply plays like a series of 'We've got to recycle that' references and a recitation of studio notes to the writers. Boiled down, the film is almost a remake of T2 (the ever changing and expanding future Alternate Universes going along for the ride).Still, I can't say it was truly awful or terribly boring. Just not essential. And, the so-called musical 'score' - horrible, clanking NOISE passing as music. In fact Marco Beltrami's (let's name names here!) score is perhaps the worst you will encounter in a major release in a long long time. Not sure why original composer Brad Fiedel was not retained (his TERMINATOR THEME is used under the end credits and sounds like a breath of fresh air after Beltrami's noise pollution!).",Null,0,0,6 August 2003
Spider-Man," OK, but oddly paced comic adaptation
","While I enjoyed much of SPIDERMAN, I had the curious feeling that this film was very much the result of dozens of drafts and rewrites. The opening and closing 'bookends' seem to inhabit one universe, while the middle of the film is quite another. Are these teenagers? Young adults? If they are so smart/wealthly why don't they go on to college? How much time passes during the running time? Is Spiderman a science whiz or just a hobbyist photographer? Besides one newspaper's headlines, why would all of NYC suddenly turn on Spiderman despite his heroics? All of these questions kept popping into my head, and the best reason I could give for most of them, is that it's largely a result of all the years of 'development' (more accurately 'devolve-ment') the film went thru from Menachem Golan to James Cameron to David Koepp/Sam Raimi (with numerous other stops in between). And, I give Stan Lee a LOT more credit than believing he envisioned SPIDER-MAN as such an obvious ripoff of the Mario Puzo/Richard Donner/Salkind SUPERMAN film(s). Some of the scenes border on outright theft. The cast is fine (though two fine actors Cliff Roberston and Rosemary Harris seem lost at times under Raimi's unsure direction). One final question, if you hire such an enjoyable ham as Willem Dafoe for your villain, why would you hide him under a helmet for much of the film?! (Even Stan Lee says this was a mistake). The big mano-a-mano confrontation between Spidey & Dafoe degenerates into a battle between two stunt men (Maguire's double is at least 25 lbs. heavier) with dueling voice-overs of your lead actors.",Null,0,0,13 June 2002
Dunkirk," A Triumph of Analog Filmmaking
","DUNKIRK is a triumph of analog filmmaking*. It's the kind of physical old fashioned movie-making that demands the literal BIG screen to tell. Seeing it back to back with the CGI-fest VALERIAN couldn't make the contrast more vivid. But, if DUNKIRK were only a technical feat that would be only a measured victory. Fortunately, Director Christopher Nolan and his cast and crew have delivered a knockout.Nolan adopts a 'you are there' approach from three perspectives: Land, Sea & Air. Little attempt is made at a greater narrative, although the scenes with Kenneth Branaugh as the Commander give some bare-bones context. But, the bulk of the picture is straight-up in your face (especially in 70MM Imax!) action that plunges you into the events. This isn't the first film to do this, despite what you may have read (there's the fine 2007 Israeli film LEBANON, most of BLACK HAWK DOWN and others). What Nolan does well here is to not make the action too disjointed despite the triple perspective AND a incongruent timeline (the land, sea and air components all take place over differing lengths from one hour to one week). Further, Nolan is able to give us intimate moments amidst the grand battlefield. The casting is impeccable with Mark Rylance, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Fionn Whitehead and others all bringing their moments to the fore when called upon.Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is, naturally, the biggest tech credit, but Hans Zimmers ticking time bomb of a score and Lee Smith's editing are also top notch along with the huge cast & crew. Like the Dunkirk operation itself, this is a team effort on the grandest scale. A few scenes don't really work and the epilogue could have been dispensed with. I'm certain that Nolan wanted the audience to exhale after the intensity of the main story, but, I didn't feel it was necessary nor all that well done. Minor quibbles aside, this was an enveloping experience (my legs were literally shaking with nerves) that needs to be seen on the biggest 70MM film screen you can get to. *(yes, I know there was some digital involved)",Null,2,5,28 July 2017
Yesterday," Enjoyable lite Beatles fantasy
","Most of Richard Curtis' (NOTTING HILL, LOVE ACTUALLY) feature work has some element of playful fantasy to them. As long as one keeps that in mind, it's not really a leap to imagine the world of YESTERDAY where the Beatles never existed save for one dude. Jack Malik (Himesh Patel) is that man. A small-time musician who travels around Suffolk with his combined manager and roadie Ellie (Lily James) just struggling to get by. The pair have known each other since they were kids, but, despite their close bond have never moved beyond the 'friend zone'. One night while riding his bike back from a gig, Jack is knocked cold by a bus JUST at the moment some kind of magnetic storm has wiped out all power on earth. Fast as you can say The Day The Earth Stood Still, all collective memory (and physical evidence) of The Beatles is gone -- save for Jack.Armed with their catalog of great songs, Jack takes advantage and begins to pass them off as his own writing. Ed Sheeren (playing a good natured version of himself) happens to be listening and gives him his first big break. Ed's manager Debra (Kate McKinnon) signs him on the spot and his career skyrockets.Director Danny Boyle adds a few touches, but, he mostly just lets the actors and, most of all, the Beatles' tunes do the persuading. The light fantasy is pleasant enough, even if the script gets a bit baggy (one of Curtis' negative tendencies). YESTERDAY never really digs down to expand much on what the impact and meaning of such an occurrence would mean*. Patel and James are charming together, and most of the cast follows along (McKinnon starts off amusing, but, becomes a one-note caricature pretty quickly). The arc of the story is pretty predictable, save for a last act diversion which is pretty questionable. Some have found it a bittersweet comfort, but, it made me feel a bit squeamish. I get why the scene is there (and, it's plot 'logic'), but it's squeaky wheel in an otherwise purely pleasurable ride. Curtis also tosses in a few oddball power outage 'aftereffects' in the margins that are quite amusing in their specificity, while remaining affectionately offbeat.YESTERDAY isn't for those who take things too literally. Curtis is just doodling a Silly Love Song -- You either get on the Magical Mystery Tour or you may as well Hide Yourself Away.* Two things the movie ignores:
1. Even armed with the lyrics, that doesn't mean the finished music would recapture The Beatles magic. The quartet also played the instruments, and, with George Martin, created a unique sound. You can't just throw a newbie in a recording studio with a backing band and out comes Sgt. Pepper.
2. In this streaming, download, and uncentralized music landscape, would even The Beatles be 'The Beatles!!' today if they were just arriving on the scene? Sure, they had the chops, but, would they be able to break through in this increasingly fractured and narrow-casted society? They might be Cold Play big, but, 'The Beatles!!' big.....?",Null,0,1,11 July 2019
The Favourite," Lanthimos' baroque royal menage a trois dark comedy
","Yorgos Lanthimos' THE FAVOURITE is a mordant menage a trois film about royalty. 18th century Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) is portrayed as a doddering ruler getting played by her attendant, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz). A new servant has arrived at the palace, Abigail (Emma Stone), and she too learns to use her whiles to get her way with the weak Queen.
The screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara is full of biting wit, each character setting out to use their tongue like a rapier. The three ladies take - and dominate strongly = center stage, but the men in the cast including Nicholas Hoult, James Smith and Joe Alwyn hold their own in clear supporting parts. The script, while sharp at times, also lets itself fall prey to anachronisms and modern phrasing - certainly part of the construct, but a bit more polish could have made it less distracting (and, if one of the writers weren't a woman the frequent use of the 'C' word would have stood out even more).
Lanthimos (working from other writers words for the first time since he debut feature), still manages to put his undeniably offbeat stamp on the project. The cinematography (on 35mm by Robbie Ryan) is baroque in its use of wide-angle lenses (too much so) and the compilation soundtrack combines both period classical music (Bach, Handel) as well as more contemporary experimental sounds by Messiaen and Ferrari. It's an, at times, uneasy blend - as Lanthimos, no doubt intended. The nod to Ingmar Bergman's PERSONNA is carried off with a deadpan Lanthimos twist.
While the actresses carry the tricky dialogue and directorial quirks with aplomb (hard to pick an...ahem...favourite among the trio), the movie eventually bogs down by the last couple of acts (the film is broken down into eight chapters). Once the three main characters are set, there aren't enough surprises to drive the drama. Even the acrid dialogue loses steam as it goes along. THE FAVOURITE is a well played film, but not fully realized.",Null,3,7,11 December 2018
It Follows," Good, not great. Fine style, muddled finish
","IT FOLLOWS is a good, not great, movie. I appreciated how it patterned itself on Carpenter's HALLOWEEN with a dash of THE RING and an overlay of Cronenberg's early 'body horror' films. And, it even winks at the audience about those homages with characters watching TUBE TV sets with rabbit ears etc. The story is about a disease that is passed on by sexual partners and the only 'cure' is to pass it to someone else.Stylistically, it's fine, but the last act of the film is unsatisfying. The themes, though potent, never really come together. Still, it's worth seeing as a respite from all the torture porn and shrill shock-cut movies that usually pass for 'horror films' these days. My issue with the last act of the movie is that it simply isn't as strong, nor as powerful as the first 2/3. Compare IT FOLLOWS to its acknowledged 'inspirations' (if this were music, this would be more of a slam dunk case than 'Blurred Lines'!), it comes up short: While it evokes the Body Horror of Cronenberg and creates a certain queasiness, it never punches you in the gut the way the best of the Canadian Director's work does.The ending has a nice grace note, but it never really tackles the morality of passing on the 'disease' to another person in any strong way, as the ending of RINGU did. Or, the way in which the townsfolk in the first NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET shared culpability for what happened to create Freddy.And, on a simple elemental level, Carpenter's HALLOWEEN has a drive and momentum that IT FOLLOWS' last act doesn't come close to re-creating. Obviously, Michael Myers doesn't have nearly the symbolic value as the 'disease' does in the newer movie, but, as a 'Horror Film' it picks up the tension as it goes along. IT FOLLOWS slacks as it stumbles towards it's conclusion. Part of it, is that there is a certain inevitability to how it will 'conclude', yet Director David R. Mitchell tries hard to follow the template of a typical 'horror ending', complete with the big pool 'climax'. (but, the savvy viewer should know that it's all much ado about very little). It also makes the (seemingly certain) idea of a sequel even more pointless than usual: It Follows Again? It Follows Yet Again? It's Still Following?",Null,2,9,7 June 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Exhilirating details, but ultimately exhausting
","Spoilers at very end, clearly marked.1969 was a year of great turbulence with highs such as the Apollo 11 Moon landing and lows such as the escalation of the Vietnam war under the newly sworn in President Nixon. In August, the Charles Manson murders struck deep into the psyche of Los Angeles. Quentin Tarantino's ONCE UPON A TIME...IN HOLLYWOOD takes place over a few days in 1969 months apart - February and August. It's a sprawling if ultimately exasperating film.
Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a 40-something actor who once starred in a short lived Western TV series and a few features, but is now reduced to bit parts on other stars' shows. His best buddy is stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). Rick's home in the Hollywood Hills happens to be next door to new tenant Roman Polanski (Rafal Zawierucha) and his wife, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). One of the odd assortment of stragglers and wannabees who have hung out at the Polish Director's home in the past is one Charles Manson (Damon Herriman). Also, just drifting around town are some of Manson's 'girls' including one dubbed Pussycat (Margaret Qualley), who lures Cliff up to the old Spahn Movie Ranch where Cliff and Rick have shot pictures --- and, happens to be the Manson Family hang.But, ONCE isn't really concerned about plot, per se. Of the film's 161 minutes, only about half of it is (and even that may be generous). Tarantino and his collaborators including Cinematographer Robert Richardson (shooting on 35mm film), Production Designer Barbara Ling and Costumer Arianne Phillips have done a bang up job recreating the Hollywood of the late 60s - well, at least the version imagined by QT. While we hear a few seconds on the radio about Nam and the RFK assassination, it's really all about the Pop culture references. Virtually every major or cult film release in '69 seems to be cited at one point or another. Hit songs are strewn on the soundtrack. Posters, commercials, ads and merchandise are bandied about like some phantasmagorical eBay vintage store come to life. The war, civil rights protests, Stonewall, women's lib? Nah, no time for that (about as 'political' as the movie gets are Cliff and Rick putting down 'hippies'). Let's see a five minute montage of how a movie gets threaded into a projector in a Producer's (Al Pacino) home movie theater or fetish a needle drop on a turntable, instead.Pitt and DiCaprio play off their natural charms either hanging out together or separately. They inhabit the screen naturally even when a scene (or two or three...) is well past any point. Robbie isn't given much to do but seem winsome and perky. Mike Moh's Bruce Lee is an affront to the Martial arts legend (having worked with Lee's family and friends, this isn't the Bruce Lee they describe). The rest of the cast is fine doing the patented coy and arch QT thing, but the Manson family scenes are largely played straight (even if the actors aren't given room for genuine depth). Over-writing is a given with QT, but, here, the seeming inability to be willing to edit his scenes to a reasonable degree severely hampers the momentum. There are times one feels as if they are watching a movie with the DVD extras included IN the film. It's about footnotes more than an actual story. Some of the footnotes are a lot of fun, but it's at the expense of telling a gripping story. A good editor could cut the 2:45 film to under two hours and still keep most of the references.The above is unfortunate, because there was so much potential there for ONCE to become a truly enjoyable hang out picture. Just spending time groovin' to a fantasy version of the 60s. Of course, that only covers the first 3/4 of the film. There's still the already infamous ENDING to address.SPOILERS, of course, although anybody who is aware that the Manson killings are involved and has seen INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, DJANGO UNCHAINED or the overlong Samuel L. Jackson C-Sucker flashback in HATEFUL 8 will already have a pretty good idea of where this one is heading (once QT begged folks not to reveal the ending in Cannes, it was pretty easy to figure out).Still, final WARNING on SPOILERS:
/Who would have thought that of all his contemporary filmmakers, that QT would devolve into another M. Night Shyamalan with his predictable 'twist' endings? It's become a joke and a self-parody at this point. Setting aside the ethics of this cockeyed alternate history, what's truly disappointing is that the Susan Atkins/Sadie character (Mikey Madison) sets up what could have been a powerful hard-hitting coda when she talks about her idea to kill the people who taught them to kill! But, if we've learned anything over the nine feature films in QT's career is that meaning ALWAYS takes a back-seat to saying, doing or looking 'cool'. He is the low priest bowing to the altar of 'cool' above (or below) all else. And, so, the yahoos in the crowd get their chance to hoop and holler as the bad guys get theirs. It's a cheap trick, that if a 'Quentin SMITH' had directed the film, nobody would take seriously, but the QT cult is mighty strong.
Even considering the fantasy construct it's also curious that QT alters one critical point - the Linda Kasabian character (Maya Hawke) DIDN'T drive away the night of the actual murders. She remained as a look-out. Also, Manson himself is curiously spared (perhaps we'll see his fate in the 9 hour DVD/Streaming cut that is sure to follow).",Null,3,4,4 August 2019
Insidious," INSIDIOUS? No, just Insipid
","I don't see as many horror movies as I used to. Still, when I see one get good reviews, I try and check them out. With notices saying its everything from better than expected to 'the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST', I kinda looked forward to it. Added to that is that INSIDIOUS was co-produced by Oren Peli who's PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was effective in a minimalist way. The PG-13 rating likely toned down SAW director James Wan as much as Peli's involvement, but the combo works well enough. And, for the first 2/3 of INSIDIOUS it's an okay if more than mildly silly haunted house cum possession horror film. Sure, every terror cliché is milked for all their worth, the shock cuts are turned up to 11 and the music and sound effects are turned up to 12, but, the film was serviceable enough. It even has a perfectly decent climactic scene, plus a twisty epilogue.But, then.........................Wan and SAW writer Leigh Wannell tack on a ludicrous sequence that makes the prior silliness look downright grounded by comparison. Full of foolishness that provides more laughs (and many MORE clichés) than shrieks. Not satisfied with torpedoing what was already a compromised ending, Wan and Wannell add yet ANOTHER epilogue that levels the film completely. INISIDIOUS has simply become Insipid.",Null,2,10,23 April 2011
I Am Legend," The Last Omega Legend On Earth
","*** Some mild spoilers *** First, we had the Richard Matheson novel with the same title, which has become itself, the stuff of 'Legend'.Next, Matheson contributed to (under a pseudonym) a script for a Vincent Price-starring version shot in Italy as THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. For years, the film suffered a poor reputation for its low budget, Price's performance and the unfaithfulness to its source material. In recent years, a 35mm print (and some decent quality DVDs) has begun showing in Festivals and in revival houses has emerged and the film's rep has been rehabbed to a certain extent. I am quite fond of it, despite some major problems.Then, it was Charleton Heston as THE OMEGA MAN in a tres 70's version. This one strays further from the novel, but Heston was on quite an SF run with PLANET OF THE APES, SOYLENT GREEN and this film and it's still enjoyable. And, the Oop CD soundtrack is groovy, man! Now, it's Will Smith in a version that actually uses the book's title. With a budget who's craft service account alone probably cost more than the combined budgets of the previous 2 films (even adjusted for inflation), the film unquestionably has the largest scope of the trio.While not quite as faithful to Matheson's story as LAST MAN, it hues close enough. Smith is a fine actor, but this isn't his best performance. Mock Heston (and Price) all you want, but the part seems to need an actor with a bit more gravitas than Smith can provide. The prior two versions had a greater sense of despair and gloom. The Architectural Digest look of his apartment gives the film an uncomfortably 'homey' feel that seems all wrong for the tale. The scene where the Brazilian woman and the kid show up and watch SHREK has a cheery domesticality that seems from another picture. Similarly, the Flashbacks seem imposed in order to beef up Smith's character's emotion, rather than allowing the performance to do so (the flashbacks don't really add anything to the 'plot'; but, at least, they don't resort to the hoary 'Home Movies' cliché!).Still, I think the film works. Largely, it's Matheson's bleak vision that prevails, despite an all too predictable Hollywood Ending that is totally at odds with the prior two films and Matheson's tale. I didn't see the CGI in the film as negatively as others have, and the Art Direction is truly superior with a, for once, totally believable empty city. The Big Studio nature of the film seems to have required pumping up the action a bit, and the whole CGI 'Fast Zombie' thing has become old hat following the 28 DAYS/WEEKS LATER films, the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake etc.. This version was in the works for well over a decade and, in a way, may have come too late to seem as fresh as it might have if it had been made several years ago.Still, this is one of the better SF films made in recent years. The direction and script show intelligence, and, minor contrivances aside, doesn't condescend to audience expectations.",Null,0,1,7 January 2008
A Quiet Place," Decent Sci-Fi suspense tale with some problems
","Note: Spoilers are only at the very end)One of the benefits of the short story form (whether written or filmed) is that one can build a tale out of a single thought, concept or idea, unburdened by having to explain every detail and nuance. Director John Krasinski and his co-writers Bryan Woods & Scott Beck smartest instincts here were to keep A QUIET PLACE as brief as it is (90 minutes including credits), but, it's just long enough that serious fundamental questions arise except for the most undemanding of viewers.
 
We are plunged right into Day 89 of some sort of alien invasion that has seemingly wiped out most of mankind. A small rural family immediately comes face to face with the creatures in a quick and brutal confrontation. Flash forward over a year later and the family is still hunkered down in their farm home. Little is ever explained about the beings save for the fact that they hunt through sound rather than vision. The only other backstory information is conveyed through some newspaper clippings and a few scrawled notes. The parents (Emily Blunt and Krasinski) can only communicate with their kids (Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds - who was so expressive in last year's criminally under-seen WONDERSTRUCK) via sign language, lip reading and the faintest of whispers. Simmonds' character Regan is also deaf (as is the actress herself). From this point onward, A QUIET PLACE is one long survival sequence, juiced up with a hoary and logically HIGHLY questionable plot twist (see Spoilers* section at very bottom). Still, within the minimalist screenplay, the central quartet of actors is able to convey the family dynamics in an effective manner. Suspense is dutifully built even as quibbles build in the viewer's mind along the way. Shooting in 35mm, Danish DP Charlotte Bruus Christensen gives the film a gritty lived in look that wouldn't have been as effective in glossy digital. The sound and film editing are also spot on. Indeed, it's been a minor miracle that a film where silence and slow-building suspense is so critical that today's infamous ADD audiences have turned this into a major hit. To have fully taken the premise to its logical artistic extension, the movie should have had no musical score at all. But, that, it seems, was a place too far for Krasinski and Paramount Pictures (we need our make 'em jump in the seats with a loud musical cue cliche, don't we?). A minimal score could have worked. Unfortunately, Marco Beltrami turns in another of his hack-work compositions (the one decent theme can charitably be termed an 'homage' to a certain popular Arvo Part composition). Again, on a purely artistic level, no music should have been included, but, Beltrami's scoring is actively detrimental to the film. The Production Design and Special Effects are fine. In the end, one's appreciation of A QUIET PLACE will depend on how caught up one gets with family's struggle. For others, even an hour and a half will be enough for those nagging questions to catch up at some point. A QUIET PLACE is a decent bit of sci-fi suspense, but, a few more (well thought out) layers could have made it much more.SPOILERS +++++++++++++The main sticking point for many is the introduction of a baby in the context of a story where any loud sound is near certain doom. Because of what happens in the opening teaser, there's a certain 'life goes on' explanation for the pregnancy, but, it still plays like an artificial (and poorly thought out) plot turn. If the filmmakers really felt it was necessary to amp up the suspense, the family could have found the baby outside (as with their discovery of the old man). But, even more fundamentally, the idea that creatures where vision is limited wouldn't have also attuned ALL of their other senses (besides sound) is hard to accept scientifically. And, the idea that after 470+ days, the creatures wouldn't have figured out that there was a nexus of activity around that one house is unbelievable. And, the finale? Risible. None of the great world's scientists would have thought of that? Here again, a short film (or TV episode) would have had the benefit of less time to think about such matters. The last shot is an unforgivable sop to the yahoo instincts of the crowd (and, utterly not in keeping with the sober tone of the rest of the piece).",Null,1,2,21 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Luca Guadagnino's tender film fills the senses
","Luca Guadagnino is one of our most sensual filmmakers. CALL ME BY YOUR NAME, like his previous A BIGGER SPLASH and I AM LOVE are filled with scenes touching upon all the senses. Guadagnino gorgeously captures images of beautiful objects, locations, books and, of course, the pleasures of the flesh. His soundtracks are filled with the sounds of nature as well as overflowing with music (usually classical, but, with more modern nods to the Rolling Stones and the Psychedelic Furs). His characters luxuriate with the smells of food and they caress the world around them.It is within that world that screenwriter James Ivory (adapting AndrÃ© Aciman's novel) places our main characters seventeen year old Elio (Timothy Chalamet) and twenty-something Oliver (Armie Hammer). Every year, Elio's parents Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Anella (Amira Casar) invite a research assistant to their idyllic villa in Northern Italy. In 1983, that person is Oliver, an American who sweeps into town with his good looks and cool persona. Oliver simultaneously attracts the attention of the ladies in town - as well as Elio. Complicating matters is that Elio is also having a summer romance with a young Parisian Marzia (Esther Garrel).While on the surface, this may seem like a simple potboiler, Ivory, Guadagnino and the cast gracefully ease the audience into the tale. The film takes full advantage of the 132 minute run-time. Nothing is hurried. No shortcuts taken. The emotions are given time to build organically. It's like a lovely concerto that plays out to its own meter. The pacing may be too languid for those who demand a more forceful drama, but, CALL ME is a film to soak in. To luxuriate within. The subtext and the atmosphere not only inform the main story, they become part of it. By the time Elio and Oliver's infatuation is consummated, you have fully invested in them.CALL ME is deliberately set in the early 80s - just as AIDS was becoming a concern, and, of course, long before coming out was accepted. And, some may find the idyllic setting a bit too perfect. Hammer's performance is a bit too flat at the beginning, but, pays off as it progresses. Chalamat (also strong in the current LADY BIRD) brings off the extremely difficult task of externalizing what is largely and internalized character - simmering until it boils. Stuhlbarg is largely a background figure for much of the story-line, but, is sterling in one of the film's key scenes. Guardagnino's choices of music is impeccable (including pieces by Bach, Revel and Satie) and Sayombhu Mukdeeprom's 35mm film lensing captures every moment exquisitely.On the surface, a collaboration between a sensualist like Guadagnino and the reserved James Ivory (as in Merchant-Ivory) may seem a bit of a mismatch, but, it works beautifully. Together (with the cast & crew), they have created one of the year's most indelible films.",Null,14,27,9 December 2017
Ex Machina," Good, solid A.I. movie
","Sort of a companion piece to HER, except this time the A.I. has a physical flesh & blood, er... artificial skin and circuits manifestation.Writer-Director Alex Garland has some fine SF credits to his resume having written the screenplays for the excellent NEVER LET ME GO and 28 DAYS LATER among others. He uses that knowledge of genre to craft a story which delves deeply into the world of what it is to be human vs. a machine. The famous Turing test is at the crux of the tale. On a purely visual level, EX MACHINA works very well within a modest budget (of course, limiting most of the movie to one location and 4 actors helps stretch those dollars). Still, the illusion of Ava the robot is seamlessly achieved through a combination of practical and CGI effects. The sets are spartan, but, fully realized and effective. Where the movie falters is that there is far too much cat & mouse verbal sparring, despite the fine work of Alicia Vikander, Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac. Like with his screenplay for Danny Boyle's flawed SUNSHINE, Garland seems determined to undercut the awe and wonder of the science fiction aspect with petty plot machinations. Fortunately, the themes here are so rich that they overcome most of those issues. And, the finale confounds one's expectations on more than one level - but, in a quite satisfying way in the end (even if it is a bit far fetched). Still one wishes that so much time hadn't been spent on the hoary cliché of defeating the Mad Scientist gambit.EX MACHINA is a good entry into the expanding sub-genre of A.I.. More focus on the 'I' and less on the 'A' (artificial plot complications) could have resulted in something truly great, but, it's certainly worth seeing on the big screen.",Null,0,1,7 June 2015
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Impressionistic, if too low-key portrait of the Murrow-McCarthy conflict
","Despite Director/Co-Star George Clooney's statements that he was not trying to take a point of view, nor directly comment on our current Post-9/11 climate, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, clearly comes across as such. It is not just because we know of Clooney's personal politics, but because the script and the film production make it clear that it wants to portray Murrow as a hero.The true test of a movie based on real characters and events is not whether they have a perspective we might 'agree' with, but whether making it a feature length dramatic (or comedic) film gives us an added insight into the people and incidents portrayed. It is here, that GOOD NIGHT falls short. We really gain little knowledge or get a better feel for Murrow, than we would with a well done straight documentary. Indeed, one might argue that the most interesting parts of this film ARE the genuine documentary scenes which it liberally uses (There isn't an 'actor' playing McCarthy at all, but the man himself in archival footage. This adds a film semiotics question which some might want to explore on the efficacy of this technique. For instance: Is it 'fair' to have a sympathetic actor play Murrow with 50 years of hindsight? Murrow is photographed in crisp 2005 35MM Cinematography, while McCarthy is seen in grainy 50's newsreel 16MM. Etc. ).What the film does well are in the acting and production design elements which are both well mounted. You do get a sense of the period and the performances are fine as far as they are allowed to go. Oddly, the screenplay chooses to go more into the personal lives of some of the background characters (such as the Wershbas and Don Hollenbeck) than it does with its lead characters. An odd choice despite some of the symbolism contained in those relatively minor characters. As a Director, Clooney uses an almost impressionistic style to seemingly just 'drop in' on the situation at CBS. It also plays (perhaps not coincidentally, as a sort of updated Live TV Theater version of events - except with much more mobile cameras). The B&W photography, the low key screenplay and direction, and the lack of a true score (Dianne Reeves is used as a sort of background chorus) mitigate against true drama, or even, genuine excitement.The film is admirable and interesting, but in an almost academic sense. One might argue that Clooney's CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND suffered from a bit too much cinematic trickery, but GOOD NIGHT is weakened by a lack of it.",Null,4,7,3 November 2005
Mulholland Drive," Lynch salvage job
","Let's face it, folks. This is David Lynch trying to salvage a rejected pilot. Much of the film makes little narrative sense (and many of the dream/flashback structures are a transparent attempt at tying up some very loose ends). Narrative has rarely been Lynch's strong suit, but even when the pieces fit together, they seem forced (imagine a 1000 page novel where the Publisher tells the Author to cut it down to 200 pages with only minimal re-writing and the Author's forced to use existing chapters AS IS - even when they no longer work on their own). There are a number of striking scenes and images (this is Lynch's forte). But, you can practically see the 'Tune in Next Week' or 'Last Week on MULHOLLAND DRIVE' title cards before or after certain passages. Naomi Watts is getting much of the attention, but Laura Herring has the kind of old fashioned 40's Movie Glamour look (save for the oh-so-1990's silicone implants) that has so gone out of style - she doesn't ape Rita Hayward's name by accident. Worth a look, but a full season (a la TWIN PEAKS - the less said about much of the 2nd season the better) would have lent much needed depth to the project.",Null,0,3,14 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi or.....Harry Potter In Outer Space
","STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI. Middle films in trilogies can bring some wonderful movies - GODFATHER II and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are key examples. But, they can also be problematic - see IRON MAN II and ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Unfortunately, THE LAST JEDI falls closer to the latter than the former. Since everyone reading this has likely seen JEDI, no need for a summary. Suffice it to say that it picks up right after THE FORCE AWAKENS and ends up with a lot of open strands and questions.  What JEDI does right is the production design, tech elements and the photography (mainly on 35mm film). John Williams' music is decent, if uninspiring. Daisy Ridley is a rising young actress, even if she is given precious little to do here (much the same can be said about John Boyega and Adam Driver). Kelly Marie Tran's Rose is a refreshing new character. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Vice Admiral Holdo. Laura Dern is a fine actress but she simply doesn't command here. She essentially gets rolled by Poe (Oscar Isaac) and then smiles and says, 'I like him' (no wonder the resistance is in such trouble if treason is smiled upon). Unfortunately, Carrie Fisher clearly shows the signs of her failing health, and isn't able to be her usual vigorous presence. Still, the worst newcomer comes in the form of 'Benicio Del Han Solo'. DJ is such an obvious Han Solo/Lando Calrissian copy that even Del Toro seems bemused by the character. I half-expect DJ to be visited by the ghosts of Han and Lando in the next installment.  Most of those deficiencies wouldn't matter as much if the whole were more riveting. Unfortunately, Writer/Director Rian Johnson has so many subplots going on that none of the characters, including the supposed main ones, is ever given the screen time to breathe despite the 152 minute length. The battle scenes are numbingly bland - no more compelling than an average Star Trek TV episode. The Casino sequence is technically well-handled, but the more realistic setting feels out of place in the fantasy universe of Star Wars. It simply doesn't feel like anything else in the previous eight features. The Force has, obviously, been a part of the series since the beginning. Still, it never felt as much a part of the sorcery and magic world as it does here. The Leia floating through space and the Rey/Snoke/Kylo mind-meld threatened to turn this into Harry Potter In Outer Space at times. Maybe Rey can just dispense with the Light Saber next film and just wield a wand.  I've saved my biggest critique for last: Luke. Unlike those who have ripped JEDI for abandoning the 'canon', I had no problem with the new perspective on the character. I'm not wedded to any particular interpretation of the character or the larger story. Unfortunately, the movie does a mediocre job of elucidating it's take. More directly, the part needed a better performance for this most critical of roles. I have always like Mark Hamill. I've enjoyed the times I have been in his presence at Comic-Con and other Cons. He seems like one of the good guys in the business. But, there is a reason why he never became an A-List star despite once being one of the most famous actors in the world. Hamill isn't bad, but he is underwhelming. With that void at the center, JEDI never can take flight. All of the other issues of convoluted story and pacing are magnified.  JEDI isn't a bad film, simply a disappointing one. With the goodwill from FORCE AWAKENS more was expected. There IS a reason why so many fans have been dispirited by the picture (yes, there were some organized naysayers, but the volume of displeasure is so large that it can't be denied that it is much more than a pinpointed 'conspiracy'). Hopefully, the next entry will have a more cohesive tale to tell.",Null,1,2,5 January 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," Interesting if low key P.K. Dick SF adaptation
","********* Mild possible spoilers ********** A pretty decent low key SF film. Nothing great, nothing earth shattering. But, if you want a break from all the action movies masquerading as SF, it's worth catching.While based on a (public domain) short story - ADJUSTMENT TEAM by P.K.Dick (read it at wikimedia commons), it's a pretty loose adaptation. The Dick story has much in common with Jack Finney's BODY SNATCHERS which came out just after this tale (something was in the air).Rather than just being a straight out adaptation, BUREAU tosses in elements of 1984, BRAZIL, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and those 50s stories of secret agents in black hats. In keeping with the low key approach, the relationship between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt (and the one between Damon and his 'Bureaucrat' played well by Anthony Mackie) is emphasized over the larger SF elements.**Mild Spoiler** That's largely a good thing for Blunt is so engaging that you can believe that a man would literally risk his future to be with her (hey, it's in the trailer).I've had my eye on Blunt's work ever since her breakout role in MY SUMMER OF LOVE. She has an intelligence and sparkle that isn't really matched by the more stolid Damon (and Damon's accent is much more Bostonian than of Brooklyn where his character is supposedly born and bred from). Damon does OK, but it's a lopsided match on screen. Further, the film falters when it tries to explain the nuts and bolts of the Adjustment operation. Better to be ambiguous than to bore the viewer in this case.The film's ending seems a bit pat, but, somehow, still works due in no small part to Blunt's performance. Rarely, have I seen an actor pull off the tricky balance between bewilderment and resolve.Worth seeing if you 'adjust' your expectations. If you are a fan of low key SF films from the 60s like the 3 British DAMNED films, THE MIND BENDERS, CHARLY etc., then this is for you to seek out.",Null,1,1,3 April 2011
Cold War," Pawel's companion piece to IDA seemlessly evokes the era
","Director Pawel Pawlikowski's follow up to his sublime IDA is another tale of Post WWII Poland. It's also rendered in B&W (by IDA cinematographer Lukasz Zal) and the (co) Lead character is another enigmatic woman.The movie begins with a Soviet/Polish apparatchik project to put on a propaganda show highlighting the peasant songs of old Poland. Once the troupe's artistic director Wiktor (Tomasz Kot) lays eyes on vivacious contestant Zula (Joanna Kulig) he is hooked. A heated love affair ignites almost immediately. Over the course of over a decade, we follow Wiktor and Zula's tempestuous relationship which continues despite extended separations. Using their connections and wiles, the pair also drift back and forth over the Iron Curtain border. But, as the line goes - no matter where you go, there you are. Their current location matters less than their volatile chemistry. Amour fou knows know boundaries.Normally, a short summary doesn't cover close to the full breadth of the story, but, COLD WAR is almost that schematic. Like IDA (82 minutes), Pawlikowski's latest is compactly efficient (89 minutes). There are, of course, many details a synopsis can't convey, but, this isn't a movie so much about plotting as about conveying a feeling. The symbolism about how their fiery history shadows the Soviet era of Poland goes unspoken, but, looms over their coupling. There are moments here that are breathlessly cinematic. Depending on one's own personal catalog of cinema, there are scenes here that evoke memories of Bergman, Antonioni, Resnais and Pawlikowski's fellow countryman, Andrzej Wajda (who passed only two years ago). COLD WAR doesn't just embrace 50s & 60s European cinema - it's in its DNA. Pawlikowski isn't simply making a pastiche, it's in his soul. And, that soul permeates the entire experience. (the movie is inspired by the filmmaker's parents)Kulig and Kot are superb, even with the fairly sparse plotting. Again, it's more the feeling they convey more than mere dialogue. Zal's digital camerawork blends seamlessly with his Director's vision, and similarly evokes the work of his euro predecessors behind the camera such as Nykvist, Vierny, DiVenanzo etc.. The one drawback here is the movie's brevity. While it worked fully with IDA, here the abbreviated runtime seems incomplete (with IDA there was only one main character and the time span is much shorter). While one applauds Pawlikowski's instinct to not underline and highlight each and every beat, there are some sequences (particularly the musical scenes) where it would have been richer to let them play out. It's a small, but, significant flaw in an otherwise excellent production and certainly doesn't lessen the artistry on ample and loving display here.",Null,1,3,16 January 2019

Everybody who thinks walking thru Afghanistan, Iraq and the other 'Axis Of Evil' countries will be a cakewalk would be well advised to see BLACK HAWK DOWN, for it shows the folly of overconfidence. Ridley Scott has always be a proficient director, but here he may have topped himself with technical bravura rarely seen before. And to those who say the film lacks 'plot' or 'character development', I would simply argue that those viewers were not paying close enough attention to the details of the film. It's all there.

Avengers: Age of Ultron," AVENGERS ULTRON: Season Crossover Finale
","AVENGERS: THE AGE OF ULTRON is plenty mediocre all by itself. But, seeing it within a couple of days of MAD MAX: FURY ROAD made it look even more like a dull retread.Right from the first scene, the 'exciting battle' is full of the kind of cartoonish CGI that is such an anathema to those with any sense of realism or proportion (which George Miller destroys with his real world stunts). And, really, what the @#$# is it with the Avengers spinning and twirling when they fight villains? Does doing a somersault in mid-air really confuse their enemies? And, why do Black Widow and Hawkeye have the seeming ability of flight even though they are supposed to be the 'down to earth' Avengers without magical powers? I know, I know. You're not supposed to ask such mundane questions and just 'check your brain at the box office and enjoy it'. But, after all these superhero flicks, not to mention the enormous resources devoted to them, isn't it about time that Marvel ups their game, and not resort to their characters just strutting, posing and tossing out quips? If Joss Whedon never makes a genre movie again, it wouldn't be a great loss.As to the 'plot', it's pretty standard issue stuff, which boils down to the Avengers having to set aside their issues and join together to save humanity - again. For a little while, it looks like ULTRON will spend a few precious moments to develop a COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT-like theme of creating opposing World Defense superstructures. But, it's tossed aside way too quickly in order to have more posing, strutting and uttering of 'witty' banter. And, did we really need to see the Avengers all assemble into a circle as they battle the baddies one more time? It looks like a superhero circle jerk.To give it some credit, a few moments are given over to showing a more normal human side with the Hawkeye homestead sequence, but, it just makes the contrast all the more jarring between something resembling the real world versus the utterly phony CGI landscapes of the bulk of the movie. Elizabeth Olson's Scarlet Witch isn't a bad addition, but, Spader's Ultron just looks like a slightly more organic Iron Man.The 'Marvel Universe' has devolved into the most expensive TV series ever created. And, the Avengers flicks are like the big Season Ending crossover episodes where they all come together before splintering off into next season's sequels, reboots and origin episodes. And, then, inevitably, there will be AVENGERS III: Even More Strutting, Posing and Quipping.",Null,1,5,7 June 2015
Midsommar," Interesting if overlong riff on The Wicker Man
","Coming off of his intense HERIDITARY, Ari Aster's follow-up certainly doesn't let up in the dysfunctional family drama department from the get go. A young woman, Dani (Florence Pugh), is stunned by tragedy as brutal and lacerating as anything in Aster's first film. But, even with that backdrop, the central story here is more about Dani's flagging four year old relationship with her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor). Still reeling, Dani discovers that her beau is going to go on a European road trip with two of his college buddies, Josh (William Jackson Harper) and Mark (Will Poulter). They have been invited by a Swedish student Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) to attend a summer festival in his homeland. Dani, kinda sorta invites herself.Once they arrive in Sweden, Pelle informs that this isn't just any annual fest - it's a very special once every 90 years bash. Of course, anybody who's seen the movie's obvious (and acknowledged) model, 1973's THE WICKER MAN, knows -- bad things are going to happen (more on that later).To Aster's credit, he doesn't just follow the typical horror movie playbook. He takes his time detailing the structure of the cult. The Scandinavian Midnight Sun setting gives it an eerie glow (the digital photography is both a plus and a minus here, with the gleaming whites sometimes veering into a milky artificial look). The story unfolds slowly and it takes a while for it to get to the heart of the matter. But, once it does, there is a certain intensity that builds, even if it never rises about a low simmer.On the downside, the characters aren't very interesting, save for Dani. Outside of Pugh (who, since her breakthrough in LADY MACBETH has continued to prove to be an actress to watch), the performances are mostly flat (and that's being kind to a couple of them). If you don't care about Christian or his friends, Dani's personal trajectory is trimmed. While showing admirable restraint, Aster's pacing eventually becomes more than a bit protracted. The viewer knows where it is headed, even if the characters are too dense to see it. Those intricate ritual details are interesting at first, but, soon one wonders if Aster and his editors fell so in love with them that they lost the thread along the way, more concerned with fetishistic attention to minutiae than telling a compelling story (Aster has recently said that he is going to add another 30 minutes or more to the already bloated 147 minute run time!). At a certain point, the torpid pacing, simpleminded characters and weak development veers it into unintentional humor (yes, there are some deliberate sardonic bits). The climactic scene (while predictable) has a certain grand guinol quality that partly redeems the bloat.P.S. On THE WICKER MAN comparisons. Aster has copped to the fact that his producers wanted a 'bloodier' version of that tale. Now, as pointed out in the piece, Aster adapts Director Robin Hardy and writer Anthony Shaffer's (SLEUTH, FRENZY) piece with his own details and emphasis. Still, it's more than an homage. The outlines of the two movies are easily traced upon each other. Naming the male lead 'Christian' is more than a bit obvious (I guess naming him 'Edward Woodward' would have been too much?). Aster goes into far more details, but, all the elements are there in the original work (and, it's no small matter to point out that in a horror movie, what is NOT shown, can be more important - and effective - than what is). And, the ending? Really? Aster couldn't have come up with ANYTHING different?",Null,0,0,12 July 2019
The Shape of Water," Adult fairy tale
","One of the most hauntingly erotic scenes of 50s cinema is the suggestive underwater pas de deux between Julie Adams and Ricou Browning (as the Gill Man) in CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. Director Gillermo del Toro's THE SHAPE OF WATER was obviously inspired by that image when he conceived of his Adult Fairy Tale. And, adult it is, minutes in Sally Hawkins (Elisa) strips full frontal naked and masturbates in a bathtub. Message: Leave the kiddies at home.
Elisa works at a mysterious government facility where a creature from the Amazon has been taken. Credited as Amphibian Man (Doug Jones in a superb full body costume with some CGI touches), the creature is under the watchful eye of stern Richard (Michael Shannon), while also being experimented on by Dr. 'Bob' Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg). Elisa is mute, and her only friends appear to be a co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and a lonely man in her building, Giles (Richard Jenkins). Elisa bonds with the Amphibian Man (think a distaff mermaid fantasy). When it becomes obvious to Elisa (and Dr. Hoffstetler) that the government has bad intentions for the monster, a conspiracy is hatched to save the beast.
In outline form, this all works very nicely. And, the Beauty and the Beast story-line is lyrically performed. Unfortunately, del Toro and co-writer Vanessa Taylor layer on a lot of layers - and, not all for the better. The movie is set in the early-60s in order to play off of Cold War tensions with the Russians. It gives the movie some obvious villains, and, setting it long ago adds to Elisa's fairy tale fate.But, Shannon's Richard isn't just a tough security supervisor, but, a sexual deviant, bigot and a psychopath. Sure, in 1962 there was racism but, what does it really add to the movie to have a lunch counter scene (at one point Zelda is even referred to as 'The Help' (I'm not kidding))? They toss in sexual prejudice and physical disabilities discrimination for good measure. Yes, the point is that Elisa, Zelda, 'Bob' and Giles are outsiders, and therefore they are the only ones that can 'understand' the monster. It's not so much the symbolism but the inelegance and heavy-handedness of how it's presented that is at issue here. Most crucially, it detracts from the core story.Hawkins is a wonderful actress. The mute may be a bit of a cliche in these kinds of stories, but she gives it a soulfulness that is entrancing. Jenkins and Spencer are reliably sturdy, but, Stuhlbarg (also fine in the current CALL ME BY YOUR NAME) is quite exceptional presenting the duality of his role as 'Bob'. Shannon is one of our most commanding actors, but his part isn't written (or directed) with much finesse. He dominates the picture, rather than supports it. As noted, the makeup is excellent, and the other effects are subtle but effective. Alexander Splat's music is sweet, but, sometimes it doesn't gel with the harshness of the scenes it's played against. Dan Austen's photography is excellent.THE SHAPE OF WATER is decent, but flawed. I have no particular issue with an R-Rated fantasy, but, here it doesn't seem necessary - or relevant. We've all seen more wholesome Beauty & The Beast/Mermaid stories before (astute genre viewers will also see homages to King Kong and other films). And, the essential base of the story with Elisa IS quite sweet. But, other than the frank nudity, all the other R-Rated elements are side points (cursing, gore and a gratuitous sex scene with Richard that only is there to highlight one particular fetish). Movies like UNDER THE SKIN and Almodovar's THE SKIN I LIVE IN were steeped in mature themes and imagery that were integral to their core, but, in SHAPE they seem extraneous. Hawkins and Amphibian Man make for a charming daydream, too bad its too often woken by interruptions.",Null,11,19,4 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Franco's meta-take on the infamous The Room
","Perhaps the hardest thing about judging THE DISASTER ARTIST is how to suss out how much of this odd bio-pic is sincere, and how much of it is James Franco putting on another of his art projects. The story of Tommy Wiseau (played by Franco himself) is intrinsically fascinating. A forty-something immigrant passes himself off as a twenty-something from New Orleans and moves to Hollywood with an actual twenty-something (Greg Sestero, played by Franco's real brother Dave). Each aspire to become actors. Together, they make a vanity project which becomes notorious as a 'So Bad It's Good' film classic. I personally drove past that curious Highland Boulevard billboard hundreds of times, shaking my head all the while.DISASTER starts off promisingly. Franco seems earnest in trying to tell Wiseau and Sestero's off-beat Hollywood wannabe tale. The brothers Franco use their kinship to give their on screen friendship an extra bit of verisimilitude. As a Director, Franco manages to balance the satirical and the sensitive portrayal of the duo pretty nicely. And, then we get to the making of THE ROOM itself.From there on, DISASTER takes a turn for the worse as the movie shunts aside much of the goodwill towards Wiseau in favor of mockery. Chief among the flaws is Seth Rogan as a fictionalized version of script supervisor Sandy Schklair (the actual Sandy quit during the shoot, and, in a bizarre turn of events actually tried to claim credit for Directing much of THE ROOM). Rogan comes off as a wise-ass who openly mocks Wiseau and the film from the get-go (Schklair has said he has trouble with the portrayal). Rogan's version of Sandy becomes a stand-in for all those who attend THE ROOM's midnight screening in order to hurl wisecracks at the hapless Wiseau. The fact that Wiseau now claims that his is 'in' on the joke, doesn't make it any less cruel.It's unfortunate that Franco lets this aspect take over DISASTER ARTIST. There is much to praise, including Franco's own uncanny mimicry of Wiseau's seemingly inimitable style (Franco's accent does slip a bit during the 'Directing' scenes). Parts of it seem to genuinely have an affinity for Wiseau and his dreams, and the depiction of the making of a low budget feature has a certain ring of truth to it, despite exaggerations.And, yet... The big premiere scene isn't credible (I've been to many a disastrous screening, and, they don't spontaneously turn into a Rocky Horror style midnight event; my suspicions backed up by first person accounts of attendees). Why the Bryan Cranston scene was invented is never explained (to get in yet another celebrity cameo?). And, why maintain the illusion of a 'mystery' surrounding Wiseau's origins? He's from Poland and he was in his late 40s when THE ROOM was made. Franco's brave decision to end the body of the movie with side by side clips of his recreations of scenes from THE ROOM with actual ones is quite meta (as good as they were, I have to say my attention still drifted more to Wiseau's originals than to the Franco ones; There's still something to be said about authenticity - even if incompetent).A large group of millennials sat in the back row of the screening I attended. They seemed primed to mock Wiseau at every turn. And, on cue, they openly guffawed at every poorly pronounced word out of Franco/Wiseau's mouth. They cheered and jeered at all the infamously poor scenes recreated from THE ROOM. Even as someone who loves 'So Bad It's Good' movies myself, I found much of their reaction unsavory. They weren't just cheerfully playing along with Wiseau's amateurishness, they were ridiculing his accent, his very gall at trying. Unfortunately, I felt some of that crept into Franco's movie, even if semi-inadvertently. Compare that with ED WOOD where Tim Burton and screenwriters Larry Karaszewski and Scott Alexander openly showed great affection for that hapless filmmaker and his cockeyed dream. Franco's performance is deeper than Depp's in that film, but, it still can't save THE DISASTER ARTIST from its failings.",Null,17,26,8 December 2017
War of the Worlds," Impressive technically, but bleak, grim and rather disappointing
","Confession first. I've never been a huge fan of the 1953 original. I think it's a fine film, but, like most George Pal films, falls just short of true greatness (THE TIME MACHINE is the one glittering exception). So, I didn't go into the remake 'offended' that they would dare re-do a classic film.Still, I'm quite disappointed in Spielberg's take.Warning: There are Major SPOILERS in ReviewThough in no way awful, and with a lot of respect on the tech end of the film, this is a bleak, depressing and overlong exercise. Obviously written to echo 9-11, the film is oddly constructed around a very narrow concept. The scenes of devastation and ravaged families carries grim implication no doubt. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's desaturated color scheme stands in stark contrast to the candy colored Technicolor look of the original. In that way, along with the 'personal story' angle, the film reminds one of the spate of Disaster films of the 70's. Disappointingly, there is no 'War'! Even in the 50's we got to see cities and countries battling it out with the spaceships. On paper, it may have seemed viable to construct a story around just 3 or 4 characters, but we feel cheated from a lack of spectacle. People in Hollywood were surprised at how quickly the production was completed (recall, that it was hastily begun when Tom Cruise became available when MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 fizzled). NOW, I know why - Take away Tom Cruise and Spielberg's paychecks, do the SfX more cheaply, and you have a low budget (by Studio standards) flick! Many have mentioned Tim Robbins's character as misconceived. While this may be partially so, it at least gives us someone besides Cruise and his 2 kids to watch for a few scenes. This is yet another film where we are asked to look past the fact that TENS OF MILLIONS of people are being exterminated...but wait...a CLAUSTROPHOBIC LITTLE GIRL can't find her daddy! Stop the presses!! As frightening and tense as the farmhouse scenes are, you KNOW that nothing bad to Cruise and Dakota Fanning, lessening the suspense. The 'twist' that the Aliens come from within was given away months ago in the ads 'They're Already Here'; Again, neat as the concept may be on paper, it just doesn't make much sense. There are thousands, millions of them. They are HUGE. How could they conceivably have been hidden away all these millenia? More importantly, they are bio-mechanical in some way. How could they have survived? (Not to mention the fact, that yes, there are germs below ground too) Worse yet, is the ridiculous manner in which all our main characters survive (Though it's a nice touch to include the original's ANN ROBINSON and GENE BARRY as the Grandparents). As much as I thought the everything ends well conclusion to MINORITY REPORT let the air of what was until then a truly superior film, this one is even more unbelievable. Going back to the 9-11 analogy, where is Spielberg's sense of sacrifice? Of loss? If you are going to invoke something deeper in a summer blockbuster, at least have the guts to do it justice.",Null,0,3,7 July 2005
Mudbound," Episodic Melodrama about WWII Mississippi
","Dee Rees' adaptation of Hillary Jordan's novel tells the tale of two families (One white, one black) in WWII Mississippi. Garrett Hedlund Jason Clarke (as Henry)and Carey Mulligan (Laura) head a family who buys a farm, but, through a mistake end up not in the landowner's house, but on the farm. Mary J. Blige (Florence) and Rob Morgan (Hap) are the parents of a family who already lives and work on the farm.While there is a cordial enough relationship between the families, there is no question as to who are the bosses. And, the day to day struggles to survive are brutal and difficult for both families. A deeper bond is shared between Henry's brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) and Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) - returning veterans from the war (we see them in battle). The segregation in the military is nothing compared to what they find back 'home'. Further complicating matters is that the Partiarch of the white family Pappy (Jonathan Banks) is as rabid a racist as any of the Mississippi locals.In outline, MUDBOUND sounds like it plays as a relatively straightforward drama. But, Rees (and co-screenwriter Virgil Williams) use narration - and a lot of it - to structure their screenplay. And, the narration floats through several of the performers. Some of the passages certainly deepen our understanding of the characters but, too often, fall into Joe The Explainer mode. This not only clutters the proceedings, but keeps the viewer from fully investing themselves into reading one's own interpretation of the events. Further, it emphasizes the already episodic nature of the movie. The acting is, for the most part, excellent. Mulligan and Blige seem a bit removed at times (and Blige's sunglasses don't help). Banks (one of my fave character actors) is frighteningly chilling as the bigoted father, while Morgan brings a low key intensity to Hap. Mitchell and Hedlund strike up a warm friendship even it feels a bit too modern at times.There is no doubting the power of the tragic climax and the gentle mercies of the epilogue. Still, MUDBOUND needed a stronger structure to overcome some of its more melodramatic passages. It's a solid production even it promised more.P.S. Some controversy has been generated by its Netflix release. Pushed as an Awards contender, Netflix's decision to release the movie straight to streaming while giving it a same day very limited release (17 theaters - where I saw it) doesn't help create separation from what feels like a TV production (it was independently produced as a feature). Ironically, MUDBOUND may have worked better had it been a Netflix mini-series, where the episodic nature could have been better fleshed out.",Null,1,5,22 November 2017
Joker," JOKER a dark bleak origin story with lots of 70s references
","JOKERWhen Martin Scorsese's name got linked as a producer on this DC Comics spin-off movie, many people were flabbergasted. Scorsese? A Superhero flick?* In retrospect, once one sees the end result it makes a certain amount of sense. Much of JOKER plays like an alternate universe conglomeration of TAXI DRIVER and KING OF COMEDY (with healthy doses of MEAN STREETS and AFTER HOURS in the stew). Director and Co-Writer Todd Phillips and his partner Scott Silver cleverly weave in the origin story of the super-villain into this alternate reality.Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a sad sack with psychological issues. So, of course, he's working as a for hire clown who spreads his anti-joy to those unfortunate to witness his services. Fleck lives with his ailing mother Penny (Frances Conroy). Fleck has dreams of becoming a stand up comedian, and , after a particularly awkward trial set, he ends up as a guest on a late night talk show hosted by none other than -- Rupert Pupkin himself, Robert DeNiro (as Murray Franklin). Also lurking around Fleck's purvueis a certain rich millionaire Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) and his son, uh, Bruce (Dante Pereira-Olson).At this point it must be stressed that JOKER's screenplay and direction use the form of the (highly) unreliable narrator in telling its tale. Sometimes, the deception is clear. At other times, not so much, to the point where one can't be certain. For the most part, it's a smart strategy. The movie succeeds in keeping the viewer off-balance even if one is fairly certain where its ultimately headed.Phoenix has long been one of cinema's most quirky and unusual leading men. As if to prove his bona fides as an eccentric, he even once pulled a year long stunt where he 'quit' acting to become a full-time rapper. Here his unpredictability is keenly used to the movie's advantage. Phoenix contorts and bends his body, and curls his facial muscles almost as if it were against his will. It's a physical transformation so complete, that the Joker clown makeup is almost superfluous.JOKER exerts it grungy attitude in an effective manner for the first two acts. It's a dark bleak vision where the DC origins are almost unnecessary. The streets are crime ridden and literally filled with piles of garbage. Other than the references to Gotham City and the Wayne family, it genuinely feels apart from the superhero machine. Unfortunately, Phillips and Silver have to not only shoe-horn in the comic book elements, but, in doing so they also become too confidant of their ability to give the movie false gravitas. Not content with paying homage to the Scorsese quartet, JOKER also weaves in DEATH WISH, and ultimately NETWORK (and not to the present movie's advantage). It feels force and Fleck/Joker's words begin to feel false and over-written (V FOR VENDETTA achieved similar conclusions much more smoothly and organically). The too on the nose song score also gets to be a bit much.Despite the weak third act, JOKER is still a movie to be reckoned with. Missteps aside, it a jarring addition to mainstream blockbuster movie-making. Even if one isn't as seeped in the films of the 70s and early 80s** it's a daunting vision even it can't fully pull it off.* In the end, it didn't happen, of course. The current 'official story' is that Scorsese was approached because the movie was to be set in NYC and it was thought his connections and production savvy could smooth the way for an easier shoot. He demurred in the end.** Along with the titles mentioned, JOKER evokes such 70s crime films as THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1,2,3 and THE FRENCH CONNECTION. That's why it's a bit of surprise when it's revealed that it actually seems to take place in 1981 (references to the films WOLFEN and ZORRO THE GAY BLADE set the date).",Null,1,2,17 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Decent wrap up to the saga
","Caught up with SITH at the famous Cinerama Dome in Hollywood (where the fans SHOULD have been lining up instead of the Chinese where it ISN'T playing!). Can't say I can add much to what has been said already. Basically, I would agree that it's a generally satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and a marked step up from the previous two turgid entries. The final reel or so really takes flight and wraps things up nicely.The action and effects are the highlights, but Ewan McGregor and, particularly, Ian McDiarmid (who gives as good a performance as any actor in any STAR WARS film; which makes it doubly disappointing that he is buried under a silly Halloween mask for the last third of the film diluting his powerful portrayal) hold their own amongst the digital jungle. And, I'd agree that the dialogue is fairly rote and uninspiring - far too on the nose and explaining things and events that we either see for ourselves (character motivations and actions) or care little about (the tiresome political machinations). Natalie Portman, Hayden Christiansen and, of course, Samuel L. Jackson, have all shown talent in OTHER films, but again just seem stiff and lost under Lucas' direction (and dialogue). I can't pinpoint exactly WHAT is the problem, but all three seem utterly flummoxed as to how to breathe life into their parts. As these films are about larger than life actions and events, the failings of the screenplay and much of the acting are overcome overall, but there's a critical element lost in the tragedy of Annakin's turning to the dark side - we don't FEEL it. We KNOW it's a sad thing in our heads, but don't have a palpable sense of loss. Did anybody have an equal emotional tie to Annakin's downfall as they did to say... Luke finding out Darth was his father? That Leia and Luke were twins? That Obi Wan was now just part of the Force? That Jar-Jar was going to have increasingly smaller roles in each succeeding film? Grin (heck, I didn't even see him in SITH, though I heard he's in there somewhere!)On a technical note, I know that Lucas uses the finest Digital equipment in the world (as does the Cinerama on the projection end), but I still can't warm up to the way it looks. For SFX, Landscapes and brightly lit scenes, it can look fine. But, Digital still can't show BLACK. Real dark deep rich BLACK! It's just this sort of murky grey. I'd hate to imagine a Film Noir done in digital! And Digital still seems to have a dickens of a time trying to compensate when a room is naturally lit and there are exterior windows shining bright light in.Trivia: Nice to see one last Christopher Lee-Peter Cushing pairing if only as a prosthetic Cushing. Lee in both the STAR WARS and LOTR trilogies really acquitted himself marvelously methinks.Can anybody explain to me where R2D2's mobility went in the Episodes IV thru VI ? Same goes with Yoda! I mean it's only about 20 years between SITH and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (a pittance to a 900 year old being!), yet YODA somehow can't leap and fly about like Bruce Lee anymore, nor exert a fraction of the Force's powers! I guess this is just an area where Lucas figures nobody is going to really call him on it, because the more mobile Yoda and R2 'just look really cool when they zip around!!'",Null,3,6,5 June 2005
Parasite," A wild tasty class satire by Bong Joon-Ho
","There are many wealthy people who have taken short cuts -- legal or not -- to get their place in society. The Kim family in Seoul is of the underclass, but, they see no issue adopting the 'ethics' of some of the very wealthy to claim a piece for themselves. The Kims are living in a below street level hovel barely scraping by, but they aren't without certain wits and skills.
An opportunity falls in their lap when their son Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) finds himself tutoring a sweet teen daughter (Jung Ziso) or a successful tech entrepreneur Park Dong-Ik (Sun-kyun Lee) and his lovely if simple wife Yeon-Kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). Before long the Kims all but move into the Parks' spacious architectural marvel of a home (each couple has a male and a female child).
Director Bong Joon-Ho who also co-wrote the screenplay (with Jin Won Han) takes his time to set up the story. As seen in his previous work such as OKJA, SNOWPIERCER, THE HOST and MOTHER, Bong isn't the most formal filmmaker working today. His movies often seem wildly inconsistent in style and tone. Seeming leaps in logic and form abound. But, what makes his work so consistently invigorating and exciting is that if one looks past the seeming chaotic structure, Bong plays fair with the viewer. The extended set-ups are a means to an end. There is a 'Bong Playbook' that he is setting up and he abides by those rules.
PARASITE is an exemplary case of the Bong Playbook. Once the dominoes fall the scabrous satire can cut deeply. Class warfare isn't an original concept in and of itself, but Bong continually upends expectations and circumstances here. Making it all the more interesting is that he doesn't set up the rich Park family as cartoon villains. Heck, they are so banal that one feels more sympathy for them. You shouldn't want them to get their lives disrupted -- but, you also can't help but cheer on the disruptors (the Kims).
Bong takes PARASITE to some dark places and quite visceral places. There's some razor sharp allusions to the works of the great Luis Bunuel (DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID, VIRIDIANA), Chabrol's (CEREMONIE) as well as, most pointedly, Gorky's The Lower Depths, but, it still remains firmly the work of Bong Joon-Ho. Without a doubt, there are some allusions to provincial matters in South Korean society that will escape domestic viewers, but, Bong's scalpel cuts broadly and deeply enough for most international audiences (it won the Palme D'or at Cannes). It's a wild nasty ride. Take it.",Null,1,4,23 October 2019
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman - Keep Calm & Enjoy
","WONDER WOMAN is a fine, solid superhero film. Usually, that would suffice, but, in this social media age, the movie has become a symbol. A cause. As a result, it is being both over and under praised, often for reasons far removed from what is actually on screen.I didn't grow up watching the Lynda Carter TV series and have only the vaguest memories of the Cathy Lee Crosby TV movie, so my main introduction to the character was the Super Friends cartoons of the 70s with her invisible plane and truth lasso. I give credit to D.C., Warners and the filmmakers for casting a foreign actress with a distinct accent, keeping it a period production and for shooting it on 35mm Film (even seen on digital, it gives the film a certain heavier, more dense look).On a story level, it follows a pretty standard comic book origin story, with a couple of unique twists. The pacing is fairly slow and certain elements didn't really need to be lingered on so long (it's the 377th superhero film - we can fill in most of the details). But, Director Patty Jenkins does a really good job of delivering on the promise of giving this female led tale a genuine P.O.V., without overstating her case. It's a tricky balance but she pulls it off. Of course, she is abetted by a strong cast, pretty much from top to bottom, and not confined to the leads. Casting David Thewlis in the pivotal Sir Patrick role really makes the film work (so, too Pine as the male lead). Naturally, if Gal Gadot didn't succeed in the title role, the whole thing collapses. Gadot is more than up to the challenge. She more than carries off the different beats to her character (and the story). And, yes, this ex-Israeli military woman convinces as a warrior (although a couple of shots do give away that her stunt double is a bit thicker body-wise). Hopefully, future films in the series will allow her to display a lighter side to the character.The only real problems with the film (aside from the pacing issues) are that there is tension between the superhero story-line and the deadly serious WWI backdrop. It's not fatal by any means, but you have a sense that they wanted to be able to let Wonder Woman loose, but felt constrained at times. Add in the dark ugly hues employed (despite Jenkins in the Director's seat, it was still produced by Zach Snyder, after all). And, sadly, there is the inevitable superhero movie cliché of the 'epic' battle at the end with an accompanying CGI overload (and can we please put a moratorium on slow-mo/ramping digital effects during battle scenes?). Fortunately, the aftermath of the battle and the epilogue return the film to it's emotional core.WONDER WOMAN is just fine as a film, but, it's not the greatest thing since sliced-bread as it's strongest backers would have it. It does very well, but, it stays pretty much within the lane of current superhero movies, even if superior to most. The female touch and perspective ARE very important and I am heartened to see so many young women and girls who have bonded with the character (and many of their elders even openly weeping with joy), but, the over-praise has resulted in the inevitable backlash. I urge everybody to approach the film with perspective. Just sit back and savor it. As the British might say: Keep Calm and Enjoy.P.S. Gregson-Williams' 'score' is awful. More like blathering notes used as a sound effect than actual musical backing. I put score in quotes in deference to actual composers like Herrmann, Rosza and John Williams.",Null,4,12,7 June 2017
Marriage Story," Very well performed, but the characters are ill-defined
","It's no secret that behind the benign title, Noah Baumbach's newest is really a 'Divorce Story' (I suppose it makes it more marketable and palatable on a marquee). After a somewhat rosy prologue we truly meet our New York City couple: Nicole (Scarlet Johannson), a 30 something Actress who started out in Hollywood. Charlie (Adam Driver), a 30 something theater Director who uses Nicole as his muse. They are in a therapy session trying to avert a Divorce, but, it's clear from the outset that it's inevitable.From that start point, the film (shot on 35mm) progresses on pretty much a steady plain - Arguments. Accusations. The woman moving out (back to L.A.). The hiring of Divorce attorneys. The attorneys argue. Etc. etc. Also, another predictable element: The cute kid (Henry played by Azhy Robertson) caught in the tug of war in between. Is 'Henry' a nod to KRAMER VS. KRAMER's Justin Henry? (there's also a not so subtle nod to Ingmar Bergman's SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE tucked in)
What keeps the film flowing is the fine performances of Johannson and Driver. I've usually found Driver to be too diffident to be really effective, but, here, he delivers his strongest acting yet. Johansson has always been appealing, and is more than fine here. The Supporting cast is also fine including Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta as the trio of lawyers involved in the case, Merrit Wever as Nicole's sister, and a pleasant surprise in seeing Julie Hagerty as her mom (didn't even recognize her as it's been years since I've seen her in anything even if she has been semi-active).Still, as effective as the ensemble is, and as punchy a script as Baumbach has written can be at times, the film's arc comes off as a bit flat. Other than flashbacks, we never get to really see the true dynamics of the marriage. The pair too often come off as self-absorbed narcissists (not uncommon in Baumbach's writing). They say they are mismatched, but are they really? It wouldn't be a stretch to think that some viewers will say that they 'deserve each other'. The principle argument seems to be over whether they should base in L.A. or New York, rather than something catastrophically wrong in their relationship.Now, it's also no secret that Baumbach has based his screenplay partly on his own divorce from Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh. That very public split also involved Baumbach's affair (and now full relationship) with actress Greta Gerwig (there's even a nod to her Directing nomination). But, MARRIAGE STORY softens that critical detail, and that's unfortunate. Not because a filmmaker should air their dirty laundry on screen*, but, because with that crucial event (or something akin), the story seems not only incomplete but it also makes the couple seem even more selfish. To substitute, Baumbach has included a knock down drag out argument between the pair where they vent and vent and vent. Like much of the movie, it's well acted, but, still has a certain hollowness at its core.MARRIAGE STORY is a rare adult film in a sea of lite entertainment. The acting is extremely good, and worth seeing for it. But, they are let down by the less than candid characters.* See Woody Allen's HUSBANDS AND WIVES for a more honest take",Null,21,52,9 November 2019
Black Panther," Solid Superhero origin story
","Setting aside what it represents for the moment, let's just say that Ryan Coogler's BLACK PANTHER is a good solid superhero movie. Just like WONDER WOMAN last year, that should be first and foremost the most important thing to consider.What sets PANTHER apart from most superhero origin movies is that it is largely content with 'just' being an origin story. Ever since SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE set the template, most first movies in a franchise begin with the background tale in the first half, and then proceed to the title character's first adventure. Save for a brief epilogue (and the now de rigeur Marvel credits sequence bits (two, here)), PANTHER ends with Chadwick Boseman's T'Chala fully earning the right to his moniker. No second act.For the most part, the strategy works. Writer-Director Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole have concocted an original enough tale (based on the works of Jack Kirby and a cameo-ing Stan Lee, of course) to keep this a backstory-only adventure. Even though there is a bit of sci-fi to spark the story (a meteorite with a magic metal substance called vibranium), this plays out almost like a tribal sword and sandal tale full of magic kingdoms (Wakanda) and god-like leaders. And, of course, there are the usual warring factions. Bringing the legend to the present day involves a seemingly unrelated theft of a Wakandan weapon in a British museum. The robbery is carried off by a cheeky villain named Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Killmonger (Coogler fave Michael B. Jordan). Getting the weapon back involves international intrigue which includes the involvement of an American spy Ross (Martin Freeman). Family secrets are revealed, battles fought including double-crosses before all is settled.The spins on the usual origin story work for the most part, although there are some points where the pacing sags, and the story-line gets a bit murky. Placing the ancient Wakanda in the context of the modern world gets a bit awkward at times with some cringe-worthy dialogue and even a character flipping the bird. It's not that some of these intrusions of modernism wouldn't intrude on their world, but, it's sometimes an uneasy mix with all the somber respect for past rituals and a certain reverence to mysticism. The acting is solid with stalwarts like Angela Bassett and Forrest Whitaker on hand to add gravitas. The production design and special effects work are solid with some intriguing twists in keeping with the story's more offbeat themes. The music isn't bad, but, one thing the D.C. films have over the Marvel universe are the scores. It's as Marvel purposely doesn't want the soundtracks to compete with their 'vision'.BLACK PANTHER's success - both critical and commercial - is worth noting. Even more so, because the actual movie earns that respect. And, the sight of the all those warrior kings and, especially, queens is sight to behold on the big screen.",Null,0,1,11 March 2018
Mother!," Whatever metaphor you go by, mother! doesn't work as a film
","Ever since mother! got a mixed critical reception and downright rejected by general audiences (earning a rare 'F' on Cinemascore) there has been a cottage industry of folks trying to decify what the central metaphor is. Everything from Parenthood to Fame to Creativity to global warming and 'mother earth' itself. To me, the bottom line always is, not matter the intentions and 'hidden meanings' - does it work as drama? mother! fails that test - even if prodigiously so. The cast and tech credits are all top notch. Shooting on 16mm film gives the film a hazy grainy look and feel that heightens the horrific atmosphere. Shooting in tight hand-held style works in spots, but, gives it a cramped crowded flavor that works against many of the sequences. You have this gorgeous huge mansion - use it, rather than work against that strength. Casting Michelle Pfeiffer gives a nod to the successful creepy house thriller WHAT LIES BENEATH. More to the point is the ad art that tips it's cap to Polanski's ROSEMARY'S BABY (but, in many ways, it's more like that famed Director's REPULSION). Horror fans may also think of Cronenberg's THE BROOD. While the film begins with some clear allegorical references to motherhood (there's a lot of womb and vagina imagery), it soon becomes apparent that Aronofsky's focus is more on Javier Bardem's character than Jennifer Lawrence's (a more accurate title would be father!). Is it any surprise that a male filmmaker would make a film ostensibly about motherhood, but shift the focus? Again, no issue if the film works on a dramatic level. Unfortunately, Aronofsky has never been a subtle or supple filmmaker (he also lacks any discernible wit). The metaphors get piled on so heavily, relentlessly and in such an over the top manner (Aronofsky's signature 'style') that long before the dual climaxes the film has devolved into self-parody. If the imagery weren't so grotesque, it could almost be enjoyed as a 'laugh at the screen' entry. And, again, if Aronosky ever evinced a genuine sense of humor, he might have realized that. Oh, what Polanski or horror-period Cronenberg could have done with the material. Aronofsky seems in need of a strong collaborator, or, at the very least, a producer willing to say no to some of his cock-eyed ideas. Of his films, THE WRESTLER works the best because it follows a distinct story and was written by an independent screenwriter (Robert Siegel). Whatever metaphor you choose to go by, mother! is a failed film, lofty intentions and all.",Null,1,3,27 September 2017
Jojo Rabbit," A Boy and his Fake Fuhrer
","Films have parodied the Nazis even while WWII raged, including everyone from Chaplin to The Three Stooges to Mel Brooks. Enter Taiki Waititi seemingly channeling Wes Anderson in JOJO RABBIT. Waititi turns up the trademark Anderson Twee barometer to 11 right from the outset. A ten year old Hitler Youth to be named Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) has an imaginary friend. And, he's not just your typical fanciful pal, but Hitler himself (Waititi). The Fake Fuhrer has a goofy grin and prances about like a reject from a Dresden burlesque show. The effect is like an even sillier Hogan's Heroes for a while.
Fortunately, things settle down once a teenage Jewish girl in hiding is introduced - Elsa, played by the terrific young actress Thomasin McKenzie (LEAVE NO TRACE). Elsa becomes the heart and soul of the movie and keeps it grounded. Jojo's mom (Scarlett Johansson) also brings some gravitas to the story despite also being a bit of a caricature at the outset. Jojo and Elsa strike up a guarded friendship of sorts despite being on 'opposite' sides - and, of course, the constant pestering of Fake Fuhrer (not to mention the intrusions of the Gestapo represented here by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell) and Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson). Rockwell and Wilson are out-sized cartoon villains who also seemingly have studied every frame of Wes Anderson's guide to broad acting. Archie Yates is genuinely affecting as Jojo's hapless friend Yorki.
JOJO RABBIT, despite far too many arch attempts at humor, eventually does get it points across. The music choices (often intentionally anachronistic) usually work (particularly for the touching coda), and Mihai Malaimare Jr.'s cinematography has some exceptional compositions. The Elsa/Jojo relationship garners some genuine moments of pathos and warmth (something Anderson rarely achieves). Waititi obviously means well, but, he is is own worst enemy as he himself turns in the most grating performance of all as Fake Fuhrer and wrote the screenplay (based on a novel). Every time McKenzie and Davis do their best to elevate the uneven storyline, Fake Fuhrer interrupts the flow and the mood. It is no exaggeration to say that the movie would be vastly improved with excision of the character entirely. At the very least, Waititi fails to give the gimmick a real reason to be. The irony is too mild, the arc so narrow that the character becomes virtually meaningless.
JOJO RABBIT is affecting on a certain level, but for a movie that bills itself as 'An Anti-Hate Satire' it's pretty weak tea. Making a movie with Hitler as a sidekick will offend some just on it's face, so you may as well bring something much more cutting to justify it, but Waititi is more content with playing nice. For a parable about a youth in Germany during this period with teeth, seek out Volker SchlÃ¶ndorff's masterful THE TIN DRUM (based on Gunter Grass' novel). JOJO is more akin to Roberto Bengini's benign if also affecting LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.",Null,13,26,1 November 2019
Green Book," An entertaining if too lite Goombah Driving Miss Daisy
","GREEN BOOK. In General ReleaseThe trailers promise a sort of Goombah Driving Miss Daisy. For once, the previews aren't lying. With the races reversed, Peter Farrelly's movie, based on a true tale, tells the story of an Italian restaurant bouncer Tony (Viggo Mortensen) who gets a gig driving black Piano Virtuoso Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour of the deep south. In 1962. A time and place where a little tough guy bouncing may come in handy. Shirley leads a musical trio, with two other (white) musicians.GREEN BOOK is genial enough, and, broadly, entertaining. There are a number of feel-good moments and a few that lead to cheers. But, for every successful bit, there are an equal number of groaners - and Kris Bowers' backing score is one long groaner, with every single emotional highlight signaled, underlined and highlighted in musical yellow markers. Fortunately, most of the music we hear is of Dr. Shirley's trio and Tony's fave car tunes including Little Richard, Chubby Checker, Aretha Franklin etc. (incredulously, Dr. Shirley claims to have never heard them prior!).Mortensen and Ali are fine actors, but, aren't given a shot at much beyond sit-com style hokum. Mortensen comes off at times like he's auditioning for an off-off-Broadway production of Goodfellas. Ali is a bit more effective, but, the script and Farrelly's lite Direction limit him. GREEN BOOK is so genial and it's heart in the right place that it's a difficult movie to outright dislike (although one really does regret that the movie doesn't take the time to fully explain the meaning of the title). Still, it's a movie that would have fit alongside DRIVING MISS DAISY in 1989, but, haven't we moved past it by now?",Null,16,30,29 November 2018
Annihilation," Uneasy mix between intellectual and more visceral sci-fi
","Writer Alex Garland has become one the most accomplished in the sci-fi/horror field over the past several years with 28 DAYS LATER, NEVER LET ME GO, SUNSHINE etc., culminating with his highly successful Writer-Director debut, EX MACHINA. Here, Garland adapts Jeff VanderMeer's first book in a trilogy. Publicly, Garland has admitted that he read the book (and only the first) once and then set it aside. His adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel for NEVER LET ME GO was beautifully done, so there was a similar hope here.
 
 Unfortunately, ANNIHILATION comes off as a distinct disappointment. Garland has acknowledged a debt to Russian Director Andrei Tarkovsky's STALKER (which was re-released last year to major acclaim). It also bears major resemblances to Tarkovsky's SOLARIS. But, whereas Tarkovsky took an exclusively intellectual approach to the material, Garland attempts to synthesize that method with a more visceral one (and there are a couple of very graphic examples).  The outline of the story is intriguing - a force of some kind has created a zone where humans enter - but, seemingly, never return. No one that is, until a soldier named Kane (Oscar Isaac) who mysteriously appears at the home of his wife Lena (Natalie Portman) who has presumed him dead. Circumstances lead Kane and Lena back to the force's front, called The Shimmer (for it's translucent waterfall-like appearance). Lena joins a party with four other women into the newest expedition into The Shimmer: Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Cass (Tuva Novotny) and Josie (Tess Thompson). All have particular talents to bring to the mission, but, all are also considered emotionally 'damaged' in some way going in.  Without getting into spoilers, suffice it to say that within The Shimmer they find an assortment of mutations - both plant and animal - and that these mutants pose great physical and psychological danger to the quintet of women. Some of the science is fascinating. Unfortunately, the characterizations of the women are dreary and uninteresting. Whenever a new turn in the mystery is encountered, it is almost invariably met with dull interactions among the women, not to mention their often foolish behavior. More than once, they encounter evidence of previous expeditions, only to turn away before exploring all of it - so much for all that scientific and military training!  As noted, Garland's adaptation not only owes a debt to Tarkovsky, but, sci-fi fans will also see parallels to the Alien series, THE THING, 2001, PHASE IV, ARRIVAL and others. But, here, the mix between the purely intellectual aspects and the more physical ones never mesh. It's also curiously over-written in a manner that most experienced screenwriters don't fall in to. The result is that ANNIHILATION ends up being a compromise on both ends. No wonder test audiences and the movie's Producers themselves wanted changes (the studio was so hesitant to give it a major theatrical release that it was sold to Netflix overseas, and barely escaped that fate stateside).  ANNIHILATION is well-produced and solidly acted. The SFX are rendered well. The musical score (Geoff Barrow, Ben Salisbury) is a curious, but largely effect contrast between traditional orchestral and acoustic instrumentation. As opposed to most sci-fi movies today, it is a movie about ideas - and, it has some good ones. Too bad the execution doesn't quite match the ambition.",Null,1,3,27 February 2018
Incredibles 2," Not up to original, if pleasant enough
","It may be hard to recall now, but, it can be argued that the 2004 THE INCREDIBLES may still be the best of this millennium's Superhero movies. Fast. Bright. Witty. And, never forgetting the human touch. The passable sequel isn't just disappointing in comparison to it's stellar original, but, it ends up being just 'another' comic book movie in what seems like monthly installments of them.The plot is simple enough. Superheroes have been banned, but the Incredibles family just can't help themselves in being do-gooders. A rich man Winston (Bob Odenkirk) and his sister Evelyn (Catherine Keener) agree to bankroll the family in order to rehab their rep with the public. The catch is they don't want the whole family, but only want to spotlight 'responsible' Mom/Elastic-Girl (Holly Hunter). This leaves Dad/Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) to play Mr. Mom at home with the kids, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner) and Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile). While Elastic-Girl is out grabbing headlines, Mr. Incredible is stuck with domestic duty. While functional, the script just seems so...so ordinary (trying real hard to not make an 'incredible' reference). INCREDIBLES 2 is genial enough. The voice work is fine (Samuel L. Jackson's Frozone and Bird's Edna Mode make return appearances). The production values are top notch, and Michael Giacchino's score groves in a 60s Monty Norman 007 Bond/Space Age Lounge kind of way. Bird, Pixar et al. said for years that they didn't want to do a sequel until they found a screenplay worthy of it. The outlawed Superhero story is an old trope perhaps done best most recently in CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR and is the fundamental basis of the whole X-Men universe. And, did we wait 14 years to see Mr. Incredible change diapers and spend 5 minutes struggling over a math text book? It just seems small. More akin to a TV series like The Jetsons or The Simpsons than a big budget blockbuster. Because of the high production values and A List voice talent, it might be a stretch to call INCREDIBLES 2 to be more suited for the Direct-To-Video second tier Pixar/Disney offshoots - but, sadly, not too much of one. INCREDIBLES 2 is an okay two hours, but, Bird and company have to aim much higher if this is going to continue as a feature film franchise.",Null,0,2,5 July 2018
Sin City," Cold overlong tech exercise a la SKY CAPTAIN
","Like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, SIN CITY thrusts us into the brave new world of film-making done completely in the computer with human beings plopped into the digital world like living 'props'. And, like SKY CAPTAIN (and going back to the computer scenes in 1982's TRON), we have a technical exercise that is deficient in the plot and story departments.No doubt, SIN CITY is a visual marvel. Working closely with the original graphic novelist, FRANK MILLER, director ROBERT RODRIGUEZ continues his development as a virtual one man studio. Having been somebody who attended one of the first Hollywood screenings of EL MARIACHI (with Rodriguez in attendance) it is both remarkable and disappointing to see how far Rodriguez has gone while not developing into a more mature storyteller. For, SIN CITY, is little more than another tale (actually three) of a desperado on the fringes of the law who has some action scenes as he meets 'hot chicks' along the way. Sadly, there is more heart, character development and 'plot' in EL MARIACHI as there is the triple anthology.As to the fanboys who are jumping up and down in excitement over how well Frank Miller's artwork has been brought to the screen, the simple truth is that comic books and graphic novels are one art form and movies are another. It is in the same way that stagy filmed Broadway plays are dull as cinema. The best comic books to film transfers are imagined as movies first (SUPERMAN, SPIDERMAN II). In SIN CITY, there are times when the actors stop, pose, and deliver their lines in clipped, curt spurts - you can almost see the 'thought balloon' dancing above their heads as if to limit how long the speech can be. It'll be great for those who love to watch the DVD's over and over, stop framing and slow-motioning their favorite passages, but in a movie theater, it's strains an already overlong film into tedium. I've never quite understood the need for some to watch the same DVD's multiple times. No matter how much you may love a film, it is far more rewarding to use at least some of that time to seek out new and varied films that you have NOT seen. Looking at the history of Hollywood, it is no surprise that the earliest films that break new technical ground {whether it is SOUND (1926's FOOTLIGHTS OF NEW YORK), COLOR (allegedly 1918's CUPID ANGLING), CINEMASCOPE (THE ROBE) or 3-D (BWANA DEVIL)} have rarely, if ever, been artistic as well as scientific breakthroughs. Both SIN CITY and SKY CAPTAIN will hopefully lead to more innovative uses of that style of film-making.",Null,1,2,27 April 2005
Mad Max: Fury Road," Road Warrior on Steroids
","MAD MAX FURY ROAD is good. The action is astonishing, and at one point, I just couldn't believe how INSANE what I was seeing was. And, you gotta love a gang that brings along it's own guitar and drums accompaniment! The use of real stunts over CGI was refreshing, but I wish Miller had resisted the temptation to monkey with the editing in post with all the digital ramp zooms and jagged editing, and color saturation.The plot is so thin it could have been written on a napkin. And, some of the dialog is frankly embarrassing with Theron's 'redemption' line being so drearily spot on, I was hoping it was supposed to be 'ironic'. Hardy is a fine actor, but, doesn't approach Mel Gibson's charisma in the role. And, Miller has sidelined Max to a virtual supporting role alongside Charlene Theron's ferocious Furiousa character.With THE ROAD WARRIOR, Miller raised the stakes and brilliantly created a World Gone Wild with sublime action scenes - but, some of the central dramatic core was sacrificed. I like THUNDERDOME, but for it's slower, quieter second half with the lost children. It again restored the balance with drama over action. FURY ROAD is ROAD WARRIOR on steroids - bigger, faster, furiouser (ahem). This time, there is virtually NO drama - Essentially: Some beaten up dude meeting an Amazon who is leading her truckload of Playboy Bunnies away from an evil warlord. Repeat for 120 (admittedly thrilling) minutes.I haven't seen THUNDERDOME since it's original release (30 years!), so I will have to re-visit it sometime. For now, FURY ROAD is a terrific action picture in a fine series - but, also, the least dramatically satisfying.",Null,1,9,7 June 2015
Alien: Covenant," Unispired Sequel/Prequel
","I'd like to report that the crushingly poor box office and mediocre reviews are all undeserved - but, I can't. I liked PROMETHEUS more than most because I thought it had a decent and fairly original sci-fi story about creation - artificial and natural. Unfortunately, that tale was crucially compromised by trying to shoe-horn it into the Alien franchise.Now, with COVENANT, we have a movie that is trying to serve as both a sequel to PROMETHEUS and a direct prequel to the original ALIEN. It satisfies as neither. COVENANT is well made, with some striking production design and good SFX. Michael Fassbender is a superb actor and he does a solid job at bringing unique characteristics to two different androids from the same model line. The rest of the cast is largely solid, with the exception of Danny McBride. But, the script is muddled and Ridley Scott's Direction, while technically assured as always, isn't inspired, either. Large stretches of the movie play as an alternate version/ remake of the original film in the series (with bits and pieces of ALIENS, a touch of #3 and even some BLADE RUNNER tossed into the stew) - but, to what purpose? The bland reaction by critics and audiences should serve as a loud signal that the time has come for Ridley Scott and the studio to let this franchise go into hibernation in some film vault pod of it's own...until the inevitable reboot down the road, natch.P.S. How does Jed Kurzel merit an 'original music by' credit? So much of it is a variation of Jerry Goldsmith's brilliant themes from the original film (with more than a nod to the style of James Horner's sequel work). Shamefully, Goldsmith's only mention is buried at almost the very end of the credits lumped with the other 'Songs'. Songs? Not even an Themes based on acknowledgment? Really? Sure, it's a great credit to have, but, wow.",Null,3,8,29 May 2017

","Smug, condescending, snide, and infantile. Nothing new for the Coens. The only mystery is why oh why are they so beloved by cinemaphiles? The Coens remind me of that spoiled rich kid who always thought they were smarter, wittier and more hip than 'everybody else'. Yes, they have intelligence, but to what end?
