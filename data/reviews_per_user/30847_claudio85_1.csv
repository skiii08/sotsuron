Skyfall," Definitely not the best Bond movie
","I went to the cinema because of the good critics but I was really disappointed. I expected much more. (Don't keep reading, as there are spoilers).In every Bond movie there's someone really evil who wants to conquer or scare the world. In this one, it's just one ex agent wanting revenge. He wants to kill M. No plot there. No cool gadgets or cars from the Q department. No hot girl in a bikini or underwear.About the plot, they could have done so much more. The basis was there but the development is just not quite right. There is the intrigue of not knowing who they are fighting against. Then they think it could be someone from within the MI5. The follow up of that is good, very good actually. Bond follows a Hint that takes him to Shanghai and there is a wonderful scene in a casino, where he finds the villain's girl. The whole casino scene is good. But then they find out about the bad guy. He is just resented. Only wants to kill M. No plans of world domination whatsoever. Not good.And finally, the end of the movie is just ridiculous. Bond kills the guy but fails to save M. Unexpected, yes. Good end, no.Another detail I didn't like: Moneypenny is a black girl with field experience... what's that? Moneypenny has always been some old lady deeply in love with Bond.3 out of 10.",3,8,17,15 November 2012
