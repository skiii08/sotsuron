The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely Terrible
","The Blair Witch Project is probably the worse horror film ever made. It's basically 5 idiotic teenagers who are stupid enough to go into a dark wood, camp, lose their map and not find a way home. It's so predictable, all the way through.... It's just boring, only the least 15 minutes has a tiny bit of action in and it's pathetic. The acting is terrible and this is NOT footage. How they can try to say it is... It's OBSCENE. I really didn't enjoy this film, it was a waste of Â£4.00 and I don't understand how Shrooms has the cheek to say that Blair Witch is like Shrooms on Acid. It really isn't. Shrooms actually scares you and the horror is sustained. This is what I expect from a horror film.I don't; however expect a bunch of hormonal teenagers running around the woods to be a horror film. Bunch of rubbish...",1,2,3,18 July 2012
The Hunger Games," Simply Amazing. A Work of True Genius.
","Well, what can I say? Simply amazing. When I intended to see 'The Cabin in the Woods' I couldn't get in the cinema as my 'age' seemed to be a problem, so I thought, 'Lets go see The Hunger Games.' - I thought it was going to be rubbish, with the reviews and all; however it was one of the best action drama films I have EVER seen. I'm not exaggerating about it, do not listen to the reviews because the film is simply amazing. It should not be a 12A or PG- 13 but definitely a 15 or R because some of it is very disturbing and extremely graphic. It has an element of darkness and horror in parts and was quite spooky; however it made it all in all much better. The first 45 minutes is quite slow and dull but when the fight of survival kicks in it is amazing! Truly sensational. I am honestly saying this with true passion, it is amazing. If you liked the book then the film will startle you, in my opinion it was much better in the cinema than reading the book. Please, believe me, watch this film. You will love it.",10,4,13,21 April 2012
The Hills Have Eyes," Eughh.... Just Horrible!
","The Hills Have Eyes is known as 'one of the most disturbing horror films since The Chainsaw Massacre - 1987' Well, I agree. Mearly - I think THHE is much worse then the entry of TCM. I found this film quite boring at the start in which I was going to turn it off but then as the action started I sat comfy in my seat and was looking forward to it! Two words 'Disturbing, Messed-Up' - I thought the action and blood parts were to over whelming and the idea of sexual violence, contact from Mutant to Human and the man on the burning tree was disgusting. The baby scene also radically disturbed me as I have a baby sister myself and if something like that was to happen I wouldn't be worrying about my own life. To be honest, animals being killed doesn't all bother me but I thought BBFC strictly banned animals being suggestively hurt in any kind of films. But maybe I was wrong. I think the writer of this film was just plain sick and twisted and I hit myself for watching this film as it has truly disturbed me. I'm not sure if I should watch The Hills Have Eyes 2 yet but I'm thinking as I bought the Movie Box Set...",4,1,3,8 January 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Authentic & Truly Brilliant !
","The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is sensational, disturbing, well casted and plain darn brill! The acting is brilliant and to what I saw; very smart. A good psychological thriller what will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The story line picks up from The Girl Who Played With Fire to which is just as good as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, It is just amazing and brilliant. It has a raw talent to disturb the consumer and it is definitely not suitable for anyone under 18 (Seemingly hypocritical because I'm 12) - The torture scene is a revenge and I was really happy about the girl's vengeance. The rape is clinically disturbing and very upsetting. I really do recommend such a film",10,4,10,15 March 2012
28 Days Later...," The Best Film I've Seen.
","This film is brilliant. This is possibly the best Horror film I've ever seen, probably because it's realistic. It wouldn't be a good horror without zombies and they included them which was good for the story line.I think this is a great film, the acting is realistic and the work of the gore, zombies and the bloody bits have being done very well. I wish it could of being a little longer but not dragged out at the end and making the film happy. Some scenes upset me especially when the young girls Dad had to be killed after getting the virus. The sexual violence thing spoilt it a bit but overall it was brilliant.",10,2,4,18 January 2012
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Simply Stunning Film (:
","This film is excellent. It has an artistic power of making almost any viewer cry. As it gets further into the story you become to realize that it isn't a film with a good ending. Every second, is naturally disturbing. Your eyes are glued to the screen while the shocking, brutal events take place.The only thing I'm against, which doesn't involve the film of course is the age rating. If it was me I would rate it an 18. It is not bloody or strongly gory or anything it is just chilling, shocking and disturbing. Though this film is all that it is also heart- warming at times. It brings cheer to the viewer ignoring the other consequences in the film. I highly recommend anyone interested in a genre of War. Drama and Shock to view this film. It is truly amazing.****Spoiler ****Don't Read On If You Don't Wanna Know. Smaul and Bruno do die at the end.That's all.",10,1,1,8 January 2011
Taken," Very Dark, Upsetting and Brilliant.
","Taken, what a rush! This film is brilliant all the way through, and you never get bored. Some scenes are really upsetting and disturbing, it is possibly one of the most violent films I've seen. The main plot was brilliant and different, it had a very good and quite emotional last 5 minutes and it will leave you startled. It is overall a brilliant film, some elements are quite different to other films; however as an action, drama is worked very well. I'm not always keen on drama, action kind of films but this worked because it was also kind of a horror in some parts. The sexual violence, the prostitution and the main dialogue of that was sensational and also at times very upsetting. Just watch for yourself as this is a brilliant film, don't be let down by negative review's because it is one heck of a film!",10,3,4,29 January 2012
Saw," Woo..... Finally!
","Saw is a great film for you and some friends to gather round and watch together. I found there was nothing wrong with this film and all the actors was great, the traps were totally brilliant and I think it is also awesome how they spent so much on the equipment. Lionsgate have proved them self to be the best horror makers, I would say most of these films are going to be a classic horror in years to come. What made saw great is how all the characters showed emotions, in some films like this, e.g. Hills have eyes, they faked screams and get killed but in this I think they actually really tried. I do love this film and I would love everyone to view it. The ending is really cool..... Find that out yourself",10,0,1,26 October 2010
Titanic," Incredible
","Titanic is exceptional. This is what a real film is all about. The love story topped the icing on the cake for me, It's increasingly sad and all the while you still know what's the come. It's a real treat to be able to watch, the theme of the film is self explanatory; however there is so much to it. Regardless whether the love story is true or not, it doesn't matter because without this it would not be as emotionally galvanising as it is. It's astounding. It's obvious that Jack dies at the end and Rose is very upset. It's a brilliant film, def a classic! Highly recommended to anyone looking for something to weep at for days! Enjoy.",10,5,9,12 October 2012
30 Days of Night," Horrible. Never Watch This Wasteful Movie (:
","Well. I was sat with my grandma watching this film and even she wasn't scared *lol* It is totally pathetic. Whoever wrote this film should be ashamed. It is to disturbing yet so un realistic. Though some of the scenes was lucky to get a chuckle out of us. Especially the cheap dog killing scene and the old man death scene closer to the beginning. It is like the strangers, only worse and that is possibly the WORST KIND OF FILM you could EVER watch :)I do not recommend any horror fan to EVER watch this as you will of wasted like 2hrs of your life. And also. As well as that is gives away to much. There probably all going to die. That's what you think when it starts.Haha. I'll let you watch and see. (:",1,1,10,8 January 2011
The Woman in Black," Brilliant & Well Acted.
","The Woman in Black is utterly brilliant, well acted, well preformed and a good horror film! I disregard the BBFC Rating as I personally think this film should at least be a 15, even if it was cut by 6 seconds; however it was still brilliant! I can not criticise one second of it. Daniel Radcliffe preformed mearly well; and it was a big jump for him after the acclaimed 'Harry Potter.' This is easily one of the best films I've scene and will ever see. It is a good Horror and very jumpy with disturbing parts. It is not suitable for young children; regardless of the rating. It was a ride to supernatural hell! - It was worth the money.",10,1,4,14 March 2012
Trainspotting," What a brilliant film!
","'Trainspotting' is about a young group of people who are drug addicts. It is a very powerful and enjoyable, sometimes comical film. I would call this one of my favourite films of all times, it is a great Drama and you can be emotional sometimes. It is also a kind of horror with some parts of the film yet very disturbing, especially when the baby is found dead. It does make you feel sad for the people who are taking the drugs but some of the stuff they do is largely hilarious. The main aspect of this film is for the viewers to understand what it is like if taking drugs, I would recommend this film to anyone who is into discovering more about drugs and life's of drug addicts.",10,2,3,26 October 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Well... Lets just say it does it's job!
","The Cabin in the Woods is amazing. It's action packed, horrifying, scary and yet funny at the same time. It picks up where 5 teenagers inhabit in a cabin way beyond the woods, however after an eventful day realise they're not alone in the woods... It is very creepy and has a lot of jumpy moments including... Zombies busting through cellar doors, A giant raptor smashing through a door with a blood trail to where several dead, mutilated bodies remain and freaky masked people! The main theme is disturbing, the fact that several people in 1 company are perversely watching 5 teens go through absolute hell! It has all you want in a horror film, gore, thrill, violence, sex, scares and suspense. It's just amazing! I would definitely recommend going to see this whenever you can because it is brilliant, sensational and just.... Creepily comical!",10,4,18,22 April 2012
