The Avengers," ...well it was okay I suppose
","STORY: Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D assembles a group of Marvel superheroes to stop Loki from using a device he stole to inevitably destroy the world. This really isn't treading any new ground as far as storytelling goes (I don't know how close it is to the comic). Yes the superheroes are all pretty cool but that's why they each have their own film. I feel that having all of them there didn't really allow for any development of the characters who all seemed to be competing for screen time. It was fairly unoriginal considering the films out there, an invading alien army comes to take over the world (by which I mean an alien army comes and invades America; the only place aliens ever seem to attack). I feel they tried to fit so much in that the story in general was entertaining but also seemed a bit rushed and not very original, as far as I could see it was something straight out of Hollywood. 2.5/5EXECUTION: The film was directed in the same way you would expect from this type of film. It had the epic explosive feel of a Michael Bay film (to be honest I thought he may have directed it until I saw the credits at the end). There were some pretty impressive action scenes which do enough to keep you watching right the way through, it was never boring for even a minute. However it was all very formulaic and the whole point of the film seemed to be to show off epic fights and to allow for cheesy lines from our heroes which come rapidly about every 5 minutes. The acting was actually pretty good. I'm not usually a fan of Robert Downey Jr. but he played his role very well. Samuel L Jackson did what he does best, playing the 'badass' he's known for. The acting was definitely the best aspect of the film. 3.5/5VERDICT: It was okay, I went to see it with friends and we all thought it was a fun, solid action film. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Everyone seemed to think it was spectacular, I don't know if this was due to the hype or if it was people who read the comics. I just can't say I thought it was anything special, which was disappointing (although I seem to be against the world on this one so don't just take my opinion). See it if you enjoyed the second and third Transformers films or if you fancy unwinding with an above average action film. 2.5/5 + 3.5/5 = 6/10",5,4,12,22 May 2012
Gravity," major spoiler in second half of review
","The most significant point anyone can make about Gravity is that it is the most beautiful looking film of 2013. and for this reason alone I urge everyone to see it. The scenery all looks stunning, and the director has successfully captured the lifeless black void of space and juxtaposed it with the stunning view of Earth and all its vibrant colours. This is done through the use of camera angles and sound (or lack of sound) to create an atmosphere which is both peaceful and unsettling.Our two main characters (or only real characters) are acted surprisingly well by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I was surprised to see them taking on these roles but I cannot fault the acting of these two. However, they weren't really given that much to work with and my main flaw is probably the writing. Since there are only two characters in the film I would have liked to have seen them more fleshed out. Instead they end up being very one-dimensional with Clooney providing moments of comic relief to Bullock's rather clichéd damsel in distress. It would have been nice to see developments in these two characters but this is not a character driven film so this can be forgiven. However, this problem is not just with the characters but with the story as a whole, especially in its second half:SPOILERSI will explain what I mean. The first half of this movie successfully builds up the tension which had me on the edge of my seat. The moment when Clooney's character drifted off really set in my sense of dread and hopelessness. Better writing could have taken this and made a very emotional film as we see our hero slowly lose hope as she realises that she will never return home again. But the movie seemed to lack to guts to go in this direction and instead falls back on the cliché of the main character having a sudden eureka moment in the last 10 minutes and everything suddenly working out perfectly for her. This took me right out of the experience as this film had previously been very realistic as far as I could tell and hence the ending lacked the punch I was expecting and hoping for.END SPOILERSThis ending is why this film will never be remembered by me as a great film, rather than simply a stunning one. See this film if you are in the mood for stunning visuals and brilliant direction. It is certainly worth the extra money for the 3D effect and I cannot praise this enough. However, it is a shame that the writing was simply not on par with this, leading to a film that, while beautiful, is easily forgettable.",7,0,2,31 December 2013
The Impossible," emotional roller-coaster
","I don't know anyone who was involved in the tsunami of 2004 and for that I am truly grateful. This film is a great example of how to take the terrible nature of such an event and create a really compelling story about the themes of love, hope, helplessness and, above all, panic.The story focuses around one family as they struggle to find each other and stay alive in the aftermath of the vicious tsunami of 2004. However it still does a lot to show the mass horror the tsunami caused for everyone involved. Not a lot of films do this in my opinion, they manage to keep us connected to that family whilst also making us feel for every character we see. This is done as well as, if not better than, Titanic. The story manages to strike the right nerve at the right time, it gives us just the right amount of hope for our characters, which is cleverly juxtaposed by the feelings of helplessness and dread. As said, the film takes you on an emotional journey, and this is in no small part due to our actors. The acting is fantastic all round. McGregor is reliably good as ever although he didn't have as much screen time as I would have hoped. Naomi Watts has really entered my radar recently, I've been seeing some of her films and she really is one of the best actresses of this generation. However Tom Holland as Lucas owns this film. He isn't even 18 yet and I wouldn't be surprised if he becomes a very big star in film. The other kids played their parts very well. The acting adds to the great character development so much so that I actually found myself hoping the tsunami wouldn't actually happen.This film really surprised me and I didn't even plan on seeing it. No film is perfect, but this one left me feeling emotionally drained. Hollywood could certainly learn a lot of lessons from this about how to make a compelling film without the need for clichés and formulaic plots. The Impossible comes with my highest recommendation for those who want a subtle but emotionally moving film about the lengths ordinary people will go to protect those they love.",8,1,3,10 January 2013
Snatch," A classic
",I could not as for more from a film that what has been seen in Snatch. If you look at the ratings I've given there are only three films I have ventured to give 10 and this definitely deserves to be one of them.The plot is confusing initially as are many Guy Ritchie films but stick with it and you won't be disappointed. A priceless diamond was stolen from Antwerp by Frankie Four Fingers who stops in London on his way to New York. Russian ex KGB turned gangster Boris the Blade attempts to set him up by getting 3 small time crooks to rob the bookies he is in in order to steal the diamond. The bookies belongs to local crime lord Brick Top who is also looking to use the gypsy Mickey in a rigged boxing match. I told you its impossible to explain but if I talk any more I will give away spoilers and don't want to give it away.The acting is first class all round surprisingly. Jason Statham narrates the film as Turkish very effectively and performances from Alan Ford and Vinnie Jones stand out as some of the most convincing and the most hilarious ever seen in British film. You grow to love each character in their struggles.The directing is superb and builds on Ritchie's previous film Lock Stock but definitely far surpasses it. This truly is British comedy at its finest and I am proud to have the DVD in my collection so see this film on my highest recommendation.,9,0,2,30 November 2011
Rush," deep character story underneath a fast paced thrill ride
","Firstly, I'll just say I'm not a huge F1 guy. I very rarely watch it and when I do it's solely because there is nothing better on. I had only heard of Niki Lauda in passing without paying that much attention to it but this film really blew me away.The film centres around the two rivals Niki Lauda and James Hunt through the 1970s as they both became famous and known for their intense rivalry for the world championship. This is not usually my type of film, I like suspense thrillers usually involving crime or mystery of some kind. However, the story in this is done so well and you can't help but become engrossed in the lives of the characters. I like the fact that no one is really painted as a bad guy in this film but I couldn't help siding with Lauda throughout most of the film, whereas a friend who saw it with me came down firmly on Hunt's side. I think praise must be given to the developers for this as they ensure that the viewer is always able to empathise with one of the two lead characters be it the fun loving playboy James Hunt or the calculating professional Niki Lauda. This ensures interest is sustained throughout.The other characters are pretty much left on the sidelines but I never really noticed as the film is solely about the lives of Lauda and Hunt and how they influence each other. I do think the film ended rather abruptly but it certainly prompted me to research around the film a little and any film that can make me want to know more after it has finished must be good in my book.The directing from Ron Howard was fast and exciting it really helped to create a tense atmosphere during the race scenes but unfortunately made some of the slower scenes feel a little rushed.Overall, it's hard for me to point out from a cold critical perspective what it is about the film which makes it so good, especially seeing as I have no real interest in the subject matter. However, Rush was a really good film and I enjoyed it from start to finish. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good rivalry with fantastic characters which drive the story. You don't have to be a fan of racing as the race scenes only really seek to build up the tension and tend not to get technical. So sit back and enjoy the Rush you'll get from watching this film.",9,2,3,2 February 2014
Oblivion," enjoyable but disappointing
","I know giving a film a 5/10 is the worst possible move as it automatically earns everyone's hate seeing as the general consensus on IMDb is to give a film a 1 or a 10 with very little scores in between. But I'm going to say that I did find this film enjoyable and thoroughly watchable, but disappointing as it could've been much more.I love the world that was created, and the tranquil scenes of Earth juxtaposed the gritty action nicely. The acting was solid all round especially from Tom Cruise who gets much more hate than he deserves, he is still one of the best actors around.So why only give this film an average score? Well, it made some rather disappointing rookie mistakes. Firstly, there were so many holes in the story. I know it's sci-fi and one must suspend their disbelief, but some of the mistakes were just sloppy. I won't elaborate for fear of spoilers but when the story finally does kick off, don't try to think about any of it too hard. This is my major issue with the film.Also, whilst Cruise's character was well developed, the others (such as Morgan Freeman) were left pretty undeveloped and hence one-dimensional. Freeman pretty much acts as the plot explainer and many of the other characters I simply did not care about as they were given virtually no screen time.If you like sci-fi action then get some popcorn and watch it for some solid entertainment with friends but don't try too hard to think it through. I left the cinema feeling disappointed at a film which was entertaining but could have been much more.",5,7,11,14 April 2013
Watchmen," For people who like to think about their movies
","I had never read the comics and must confess had not actually heard of them until the film's release. All i knew was that it had people in masks and apparently some strong violence. What I expected was a generic superhero movie (batman style) with a predictable plot and lots of action. What i got was a very good surprise. Set in an alternate reality whereby America won the Vietnam war and Nixon as president long after the legal limit for presidency the film succeeds in building tension as the cold war becomes much closer to another World War whilst at the same time retired heroes (or masked vigilantes) appear to be being picked out for assassination.I won't talk any more of the story but that combined with the brilliant acting all round and character development that attatches the viewer to the characters like no other film I've seen makes this one the top 5 films i have seen. But! this is only my opinion and the film would not be enjoyed by firstly those looking for another Dark Knight as I would place it in a completely different genre, it requires more thought with only a small number of action sequences and it is more about the deep story and the background than a face off between two nemeses. And also by those who find it hard to accept films as they are and need films to be realistic because, lets face it, a blue godlike man is hardly the most believable character.Overall the film is a great symbol of different perceptions on society and is everything I would enjoy seeing in a film although it wasn't until i saw it a second time i realized how great it is.",8,5,10,10 April 2011
Collateral," Intelligent drama and Cruise's best film
","Having seen this film about 6 times and holding it in my top 10 films of all time, I was so surprised to learn that not many people have seen this film. Most people love 'Heat' whereas 'Collateral', a film with the same director in the same style, went by rather unnoticed. So I'm just going to say watch this film as it has something there for most film lovers.You shouldn't go into it with too many details, just that Tom Cruise breaks his usual role and plays a cold, calculating killer named Vincent who happens to step into a cab of a pathetic yet optimistic, kind hearted driver named Max (Jamie Foxx). The film shows the events of one night as our two completely opposite characters are thrown together by chance. I won't say more for fear of spoilers but the story is fantastic right up until the ending which did become a little predictable though it was carried out very well.For those that like slow moving character dramas, this film has plenty of that with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Tom Cruise is a great actor but he is excellent in his role as Vincent, playing such a cool character and really making me feel like that is who he actually is. He should do similar roles more often rather than always playing the hero. Jamie Foxx shows some of the best character development in film and his role here put him on the map for me. For those who love action films there is certainly some very well directed action from the man who brought us that spectacular heist scene in 'Heat'. It isn't on such a huge scale as 'Heat' but it isn't meant to be either. This is a slow moving character film but the action sequences will not disappoint action fans, most notably the chaotic club scene which was carried out so well.I'll say again that this film is so good that I am so disappointed that so few people have actually seen it. If you're a fan of 'Heat', or suspense films, or character driven dramas then see this film and I hope you enjoy every moment of it.",9,1,1,23 April 2013
The Machinist," Deep and powerful, a great film
","STORY: This is a film that intrigues you from the start. I knew I was going to like this film after only a few minutes. The story plunges you into the mind of insomniac Trevor Resnik; a worker at some form of machine works. He looks so thin he could break in half at any minute. In the first half an hour the film gives you so many questions: Why is he so thin? why hasn't he slept? what is significant about 1:30? What's with the eerie fairground ride? These are all questions that keep you guessing until the last five minutes. A Great film for lovers of this peculiar genre. Anyone familiar with my reviews knows I enjoy a change from the usual Hollywood clones being mass produced, and this definitely isn't one of them. It ( I feel) goes where Fight Club didn't quite reach. 4.5/5EXECUTION: Well most of us (including myself) thought of Christian Bale as Batman or the guy in American psycho (both good films by the way) but The Machinist is where we really get to see his strength and diversity as an actor, it has put him higher in my books. The supporting cast is generally great and the directing style used creates an eerie atmosphere. Most importantly, it avoids any cheesy Hollywood drama or clichés that I have come to expect in most films, a pleasant surprise. The execution really adds to the exciting, thought provoking plot, making the whole experience entirely worthwhile. 4.5/5VERDICT: Highly recommended film for people who, like me, get bored with the usual Hollywood blockbusters and would rather have a thought provoking, slow moving but intriguing film. 4.5 + 4.5 = 9/10",9,1,1,9 March 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," it was a nice surprise when it actually turned out to be good
","STORY Well the story is fairly obvious, guy gets bitten by spider....guy becomes Spider-Man. It has been seen. However, its the other subplots and character developments which make this film actually (in my opinion) better than the 2002 film. I felt more attached to the characters like Uncle Ben for example. I won't go into details as I don't give spoilers but it was more emotional, and characters were much more relatable. The only real flaws I thought were the villain who's scenes felt a little rushed and the film didn't dwell on his character enough, and also the fact that Peter just wasn't nerdy enough, although that may be down to casting. 3/5EXECUTION Firstly, I really enjoyed the directing, and with the 3D it did actually look pretty impressive. The camera work was smooth and really made each scene stand out especially the ones that actually showed Spider-Man. The acting was good all round, I think Martin Sheen stole some of the scenes he was in and Rhys Ifans played the part of Dr Connors really well, although he probably was't seen enough as I would have liked. Andrew Garfield is a good actor but I'm just not sure he's right for this role, Spider-Man is meant to be the repressed but sarcastic science geek and that just wasn't carried out well. This is just nit picking though, the film was executed very well in my opinion. 4/5CONCLUSION After being dragged to this film by some mates, it was a nice surprise when it actually turned out to be good. It was slightly more gritty and emotional than the 2002 film whilst staying true to its roots. I'd recommend a watch as its probably worth seeing. At the very least I think people will be glad they saw it. 3/5 + 4/5 = 7/10",6,27,55,10 July 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Tragic
","I will firstly say i had never read the book or comic or whatever it was prior to seeing this movie and i went to see it on the recommendation that it was a refreshing teen comedy like nothing seen before.I'm glad i had never seen anything like it before or after, i can honestly say that it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life and probably the worst i ever will see. I can deal with strange films that are at least entertaining with some good characters. This, however, did not in any way allow engagement with the unbelievable characters and instead left me detached and outraged at such a dire storyline. It features a regular (ish) boy who manages to find himself not only with two girlfriends since he seems too pathetic to tell either of them but also having to fight off a number of evil ex's in a comic book/video game/power rangers style set of battles which occur completely out of the blue, almost as if the developers forgot they weren't designing a video game. That's as far as i care to explain the plot as there really is nothing else to it. For anyone obsessed with terrible corny Teen dramas and Tekken with a slight flavour of Pokemon i guess it would be a dream come true. I'm not trying to have a go at the many users who have rated this movie so high and have indeed reviewed it so positively but i just don't understand the attraction. I feel the same way Tom Hanks did in Big when he made the insightful comment: 'I don't get it'.I would not see this movie again even if you paid me and it is the only film in which i wanted to walk out of the cinema, demand my money back, and forget i ever saw it. Truly the worst film i have ever seen, not entertaining or funny but pointless and immature; thus i don't feel i can recommend this film to any audience. would give it 0 if i could.",1,10,25,2 November 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Misunderstood masterpiece
","Who would have thought such a simple plot could become this much of a classic. I can't find any fault at all with the film itself and I'm so glad to have it in my collection.The plot is simple as I said focusing on 4 survivors of a failed diamond heist as they attempt to unravel who was the rat who set them up. This film isn't about the plot, however, it is about the characters and this is where the film shines as possibly the best ever. Each character is unique but not clichéd and this is very clever. They manage to make the watcher both like and dislike them at different times. This is true even to the extent that a conversation about Madonna and tipping can be interesting to listen to. The most interesting parts of the film are where it takes you into the back-stories of the main characters including the planning of the heist.The acting is carried off superbly particularly by Michael Madson as the quiet psychopathic Mr Blonde and Steve Buscemi as the prickly nervous but logically thinking Mr Pink. When it gets to the end of the film you will have got to know all of these characters and the tense climax holds up against the best modern films. This film proves that you don't need a huge budget and CGI to make a good movie.Reservoir Dogs is somewhat similar in style of directing and filming to Tarantino's later film Pulp Fiction. But I prefer Reservoir Dogs as it is the classic that started it all off. I would recommend it to people who appreciate a movie that makes you think and isn't about action heroes or explosions but is much more subtle. It would be easy to mistake this for a plain movie with too much bad language and violence for the sake of violence. It is much more than that trust me and you'll soon find that Reservoir Dogs goes much deeper than so many titles out there.",10,0,0,8 December 2011
The Iron Giant," The best animated film for all ages
","as a twenty-something year old man my favourite films include the likes of Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Seven and I hope soon to see the Wolf of Wall Street. However, I have fond memories of my childhood, the days of Toy Story and Disney Classics. I say this to give context behind me stumbling upon The Iron Giant today on television. I partly remember really liking it as a child so I put it on in the background while I did some work, but within 5 minutes I was completely engrossed as this film is fantastic.This film is about a giant metal robot that arrives on Earth in the 1950s for unknown reasons and a boy who finds him and befriends him. The two form a heart-warming bond as the child tries to protect his new friend from a paranoid government official. This is set against the backdrop of the cold war and the suspicion and fear that came with it. I wont spoil any more but this film is so emotional I'm not ashamed to admit I felt a few tears once or twice. The story is very simplistic yet it touches on a number of ongoing political issues, most importantly that just because we don't understand something, doesn't mean it's a threat.Despite gong into these themes, the film never feel like it's preaching or talking down to the audience, and fortunately it came before the era when everything had to be very PC so don't expect anything like this film to be showing any time soon.To sum up my short review, this film is a must-see even for those who don't like animated films, I don't usually watch them but this is definitely an exception. This is a film to watch with your family on a wet weekend day when you're in the mood for being cosy. I think children will enjoy the aforementioned giant metal robot but the film goes so much deeper than that, making it possibly the best animated family film I've ever seen.",9,1,2,2 February 2014
X-Men: First Class," a very good movie on its own
","I will start off by saying i am not a fan-boy of X-Men particularly. I never read the comics or anything and saw the original trilogy which i thought was pretty average. However when i saw the Wolverine movie a few years ago i was very impressed and this film has continued to impress me. From what i remember of the original trilogy it manages to avoid conflicting with it and in fact explains much of what is behind the behaviour of each character similar to the way Wolverine did. It allows the viewer to relate to both of the main characters in their parallel stories and sympathize with their conflicting ideals which gradually become more intense and build up to an unforgettable climax. I won't go into detail of the story as there is not much more to explain without giving away plot points.I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good, watchable action film and enjoys feeling attached to the characters and the story. Therefore in my opinion it is thoroughly entertaining as a standalone film. Id recommend checking other reviews if you are a loyal X-Men fan.",8,0,2,5 June 2011
