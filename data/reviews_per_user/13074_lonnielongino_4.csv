The Expendables 2," Better than the first film.
",This is one of those rare cases where the sequel is better than the original. The first film didn't develop a storyline until the middle of the film. It was just pretty much high name action stars performing huge action sequences with no plot. But this second film starts out with an interesting story and also doesn't disappoint on the action. All of these big name actors yet Jason Stathams character stands out as witty and wisecracking. He & Stallone work well together.,7,0,0,16 May 2020
Knowing," Very underrated
","Knowing is one of the most interesting films I have ever seen. The story is a real attention getter. Nicholas Cage & Rose Byrne both are fantastic in lead roles, in fact I would say this is Cages best effort. The Easter eggs(white rabbit) no pun intended are throughout the film. I won't spoil the storyline other than to say it is an end of days film that won't offend Christians, even though it doesn't follow the Revelation 100%. Overall this film deserves much better reviews than some gave it. Excellent 10/10.",10,0,1,9 May 2020
The Shining," Shines in every way!
",What Kubrick has created with his interpretation of the Stephen King book 'The Shining' is a horror masterpiece. I saw this movie as a young teen and it has stuck with me every since. I've seen it many times since and have really grown to appreciate the sheer perfection of a horror movie it is. The acting is spot on and the story never takes a slow down. It just keeps building and building until the final scenes and just quite possibly the best final scenes ever. I'm a fan of all of Kubricks work but this is his masterpiece.,10,1,1,6 April 2020
Wanted," Don't get the hate?
","I just don't get the negative reviews on this film. It is a well made, well acted, over the top action film. It compares action wise to movies like John Wick or The Bourne series in my opinion.
The top notch cast are all very believable in their roles. James McAvoy did an outstanding job in the male lead. I know it is not some sort of complex drama, but what action movie is? If you take it for what it is, you will definitely enjoy this one. It is pretty much action and over the top stunts from the start.
I also enjoyed this plot twist late in the film. I won't go into detail so it won't spoiler anyone.",9,0,0,6 May 2020
