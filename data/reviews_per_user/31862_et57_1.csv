The Rock," another SaveTheWorld single-handedly
","not very original. Well played by excellent actors, who really save the movie. Take a film set and a lame story, add a big problem (like erasing a city), put in some good actors, a good dose of stunt work and you have got yourself another SaveTheWorld-movie.Of course, it is saved, or else we would not be here, would we ?It's always nice to see Connery at work he overpowers any and all actor in any film. Seen Red October ? there he does it again.Pity, the Americans can't make a movie WITHOUT heroes... The shout out scenes are improbable: how can you miss 5 guys in a 20x20 meter space, emptying your submachine gun ?",7,1,1,17 October 2005
