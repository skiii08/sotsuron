3:10 to Yuma," Incredible
","This is by far the best movie I have seen in years. Russell Crowe as outlaw Ben Wade and Christian Yale as Dan Evans, a rancher struggling to support his family, are both brilliant. This movie demonstrates that without a doubt they are both of his generation's most talented actors. Seeing them interact on screen is delightful. Yale plays Evans brilliantly,and Crowe,damn,is just too cool for words. I've never seen the original,but I can't imagine anything topping this. It is in the same league as the classic Western 'High Noon.' My advice is don't miss this one. It is rated R,for language and violence, but I wouldn't hesitate to bring my teenager. It's powerful message of redemption and friendship is inspiring.",10,2,6,8 September 2007
