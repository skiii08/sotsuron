The Blair Witch Project," Bah. Stupid.
","This was, by far, the most lame excuse for a scary movie I've ever seen. I kept thinking that I would have strangled Heather myself and stuffed her body under some bush long before the movie reached the end just because of her personality and incessant whining. It had great potential to be a lot more than it was, but they never got scared (or gave you the feeling they were scared) till Josh disappeared. From there on it was just hectic and disjointed. I never could tell what they found in the house that was so terrifying. I kept waiting for a climax in the movie, but one never came. The whole experience was a big let down and a waste of time, imo.",2,1,4,28 October 2007
