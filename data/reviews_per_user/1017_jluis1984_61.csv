Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The best part was saved for the end...
","A year after the release of 'Kill Bill Vol. 1', director Quentin Tarantino's tribute to the 70s, appears the conclusion to the Bride's quest for revenge. While originally meant to be one single film, the studio forced Tarantino to make two films out of it due to the very long runtime the film would have had. Whether this information is true or not, personally I think that the decision to split the film in two was actually beneficial for the plot, as this allowed Tarantino the liberty to take two slightly different approaches (although the overall 'feeling' is still the same in the two films) to tell one single bloody story of love, hate, and revenge.'Kill Bill Vol. 2' presents the final part of The Bride's (Uma Thurman) saga, as we follow the former assassin in her way to meet Bill's younger brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), and her nemesis, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), numbers three and four in her list after killing O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Viviva A. Fox). However, the path to finally find and kill Bill (David Carradine) is filled with troubles and surprises, as the remaining members of The Deadly Viper Assassination squad are now expecting her and ready to make her meet her end. One question remains, will she be strong enough to kill her former boss and ex lover, Bill? Just like the former chapter, 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is an ode to the films that inspired Tarantino to make films, and while the first volume of the saga was focused on 70s films (specially martial arts movies), this volume goes further in the past and showcases Tarantino's taste for noir films (in a very well-done intro that captures that style) and specially for Westerns. As the Bride moves to the West to face Budd and Elle, the Western genre begins to domain the film's style with nods not only to the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s, but also to John Ford's classic films. Tarantino plays with his influences and pays a respectful homage to them (even manage to include a new nod to martial arts films) without going out of the context of his revenge tale.'Vol. 2' marks a definitive change in tone from the first, as while 'Vol. 1' is a visually arresting display of action, 'Vol. 2' moves in a more personal, introspective environment, closer to the Western films that influenced it. Tarantino's script takes a strength unseen in the first part and the film becomes the character study that was missed in the first. The Bride's quest for revenge becomes more complex than what it seemed at first, and her enemies as well present inner conflicts that show a development from the first film. It's overall a less flashy, but more meaty film that completes the first part in a very fitting way. If 'Vol. 1' is the visceral passionated side of the story, 'Vol. 2' is the intellectual (although no less passionated) side of it.Uma Thurman is back as The Bride and here finally she can show that not only she can do lots of stunt, she also can act. Her character's background is really expanded here and so are her chances to shine. Again, it is her character what drives the film, so her performance truly makes the difference between a dull movie and an exciting film. David Carradine finally appears as Bill, presenting a sympathetic side of a character we learned to hate in 'Vol. 1'. Not an easy task for an actor, and surprisingly Carradine makes it work. Personally, I had little faith in his performance but was pleasantly surprised by it. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are fantastic in their roles as the Bride's former teammates; Madsen in a low-key performance that shows the underrated talent the man has, and Hannah in a role that shows her great skill for black comedy.Many people bashes both 'Kill Bill' volumes accusing them of being rip-offs of classic films, but I find such claims a bit naive or biased, as even when Tarantino certainly borrows a lot from those movies, he does it in a respectful way (and also carefully places the elements in his own world) that can only be accused of being a tribute rather than a shameless steal. Personally, I found 'Vol. 2' to be the best part of the saga, mainly in the way the characters become as important as the visual style, and also in the way it references its influences without the flashy display of the first part. Still, watching the film is rather pointless without having seen 'Vol. 1', as unlike the first one, this movie can't stand alone on its own (well, it's a direct sequel).While the first 'Kill Bill' is a triumph of style over substance, 'Vol. 2' is certainly the substance's revenge. Tarantino concludes the Bride's saga in an almost flawless way that improves the first part and leaves the door open to new interesting projects in the future. Probably the separation in two volumes was for the best, as 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is a satisfactory conclusion for a bloody tale of revenge. 9/10",9,1,2,24 October 2006
Vertigo," Masterpiece or failure? I agree with the former
","When Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' opened in 1958, it had a cold reception by both critics and audience, and many even consider it a failure in his remarkable career. Even Hitchcock wondered about what went wrong and he blamed lead star James Stewart for the failure. What probably happened, was that this time, Hitchcock's usual walk on the dark side went a bit too far for the times.'Vertigo', based on Pierre Boileau's novel 'd'Entre Les Morts', is a dark tale of romance, obsessions and lies, all spiced up with the lead character's acrophobia. James Stewart is our protagonist, as Scottie, he plays a detective whose sudden retire from the police was caused by an accident involving his acrophobia, his fear of heights.Hired by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), a mysterious old friend from school; he accepts the mission of following Elster's wife, Madeline (Kin Novak), who supposedly is possessed by the ancient spirit of one of her ancestors, and that eventually will take her life. As Scottie tries to protect Madeline, he falls in love with her, starting a forbidden romance that is doomed from the start. After Scottie fails to save Madeline's life due to the vertigo caused by his acrophobia, his obsession with her take him to commit unexpected actions.Boileau's complex story of obsession may had been too much for the critics and the audience of its time; and watching James Stewart going from a regular guy to a man bordering insanity certainly didn't help the film. Nevertheless, time has proved that 'Vertigo' was indeed a powerful film undeserving of the cold reception it had.James Stewart gives probably his best performance ever, the sudden fall from grace that eventually take its toll on Scottie is perfectly portrayed by Stewart. Hitchcock was really wrong at blaming James for the failing, as it was the audience who was not ready to see their hero turned into a grotesque monster.Kim Novak plays his role with grace, although certainly her character is not as demanding as Stewart's. The movie is all about Scottie and his failed romance leading to the destruction of his life. This complex persona makes him one of the best fictional characters ever written, let alone portrayed on film.The technical aspects of the movie are superb too, Hitchcock creates a brilliant composition of colors and the visuals are beautiful. Bernard Herrman's score is subtle but fitting, although not as powerful as his famous work on 'Psycho'.If a flaw is to be found, I would say that the script developed for the film was probably not the most friendly for the audience. This film is certainly not for everyone, as it's slow pace and heavy darkness in the subject may turn off people familiar with Hitchcock's lighter films as his usual dark humor is not present here The only film I can relate to 'Vertigo' in terms of harsh 'darkness' would be 'The Wrong Man'; although the big difference is, that in that film, the trouble is caused by outside forces, while in 'Vertigo', we get a glimpse to that dark part of our soul we do not dare to watch.The first time I watched it, I was not sure about what had just happened in front of my eyes, not sure if it was good or bad. After a second watch I guess this is of the kind of films that grow on you. Some consider it a failure and others consider it a masterpiece; my opinion stands closer to the latter: I call it a great piece of cinema. 9/10.",9,21,29,13 February 2006
Howl's Moving Castle," Near-perfect fantasy from genius Miyazaki...
","Director Hayao Miyazaki has always given more than simple animated films. With deep roots in the fantasy genre, his stories go beyond the concept of fable and become epic stories of love, drama and comedy thanks to his highly developed writing style and his multidimensional characters. 'Hauru no Ugoku Shiro' or 'Howl's Moving Castle', is a film that serves as very good example of Miyazaki's style; it contains the epic fantasy elements he has constantly developed since his debut in 1984 with Kaze no Tani no Naushika (Nausicaä of the Valley of the Winds) and also contains the light-hearted comedy of efforts like 'Majo no Takkyûbin' (Kiki's Delivery Service) of 1989.The movie is set in a fantasy version of Europe where magic and technology coexist. Sophie is a young girl in a small town of a nation on the verge of war; she is very mature and responsible but is also very shy and unconfident. One night she is visited by the Witch of Watse, and transformed into an old woman. Since the curse forbids her to speak about the curse itself, she decides to go and find a way to return to her real age by herself, but in her quest she ends up in the fabled Moving Castle of the legendary wizard Howl, who is said to be a cruel ruthless monster. She will discover that Howl is very different than what legends say.Loosely based on Diana Wynne Jones' novel, Miyazaki completely makes the story his own while still retaining the story's core plot. This in no ways means that the adaptation is not good, it just means it is different. As usual, Miyazaki focuses in his favorite themes of love, redemption and catharsis and gives the story his touch. The humane traits of the characters makes them multidimensional and like in the rest of his work, there is no clear good and evil, only complex relations between characters.As I wrote above, the film feels like a summary of Mizayaki's previous work and it is probably the movie that most clearly defines the director's style and philosophy. The classical elements of epic quests are present but are mixed with elements of romance and comedy that never feel out of place. Miyazaki mixes genres perfectly and gives the movie an unnatural charm that can only be described as magic.Of course, the animation is top-notch like Studio Ghibli usually does. The beautiful landscapes inspired by European towns and cities make a great contrast with the advanced technology and the visually stunning magic of this fantastic world. The Moving Castle, a walking metal behemoth, is at the same time imposing and strangely beautiful. There is no scene in the movie that is not either beautiful, mesmerizing or both. The animation by itself is a work of art.The characters are very well defined and are very likable. It is easy to identify with them thanks to the very well-written script. The detailed emotions the characters have go beyond simple plot points, and it was great to see so complex characters come to life in an animated film. I have not heard the English dubbing, but I must say that the Japanese one truly captured the feeling of the characters and as usual in Ghibli, the cast was up to the challenge.'Howl's Moving Castle' is a very enjoyable film that displays Miyazaki's style at its best. It is a great film not only for kids or fans of Japanese animation, but for the general audience. Very few films these days capture this kind of magic, and I must add that 'Howl's Moving Castle' is not only among Hayao Miyazaki's best works, it is one of the best films of the last years. 10/10",10,3,5,12 May 2006
Walk the Line," Now, this is first class acting...
","Director James Mangold seems to be back in shape after the mediocre 'Identity' and the awful 'Kate & Leopold'; the story of the love of country legends Johnny Cash and June Carter fits perfectly that old style Mangold displayed in earlier films like 'Copland' or the award winner, 'Girl, Interrupted'.Mangold is not alone in this endeavor, the movie would not be the same if it weren't for the outstanding performances of Joaquin Phoenix as Mr. Cash, and specially Reese Whiterspoon as Mrs. Carter. They go beyond acting and completely capture the character in a way not seen since Jim Carrey's performance as Andy Kaufman in 'Man on the Moon'.Based on both Cash's autobiographies, the movie starts with the tragic even that killed Cash's older brother, and we get a glimpse of his harsh relationship with his father, superbly played by Robert Patrick. Years later, we follow Johnny Cash through his period in the air force and his time as a door-to-door salesman when he started composing the songs that would give him a contract with legendary producer Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts).During all this time the image of June Carter is constantly present in Cash's life, and when they finally meet each other the amazing chemistry on screen between actors Phoenix and Whiterspoon seem to mimic the real Carter & Cash chemistry on real life.If Phoenix is amazing, Whiterspoon is out of this world, as her portrait of June Carter is what makes this movie special. She goes beyond acting and give a performance larger than life, that not only is appropriate in itself, it also serves a backbone for the whole storyline.Because this is not only a Cash biography, it is the tale of the love between two talented musicians that had to overcome hard times such as their previous marriages, June fading fame and most important, Cash's addiction to drugs. Director James Mangold makes the movie flow easily and takes enough time to show the several events in their life without compromising artistic value and historic realism.However, the movie is not perfect; its biggest flaw is that it follows the typical formula of a biopic, and even with the terrific acting of both Phoenix and Whiterspoon, the movie falls in the same sentimentalism trap as 'Girl, Interrupted'. Nevertheless, the movie is still superior to most biopics, as very few capture the soul of the real persons it portrays.While probably is not the best picture of 2005, the couple of lead stars gave the best performances of the year and probably, the best performances of their careers so far. 8/10. Really good.",8,0,0,9 February 2006
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Probably Monty Python's movie masterpiece...
","Story says that after the enormous success of 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', a reporter asked the comedy troupe about their next film project. Not having an answer for that, Eric Idle answered 'Jesus Christ - Lust for Glory' as a joke, and it became their typical answer to questions about the Python's future projects. Fortunately, what started as a joke soon began to be taken seriously by the comedians as an interesting project to make, and they began working in a movie, not about the life and times of Jesus Christ (as they were unable to find anything to mock about it), but about the credulity and hysteria of those who follow messianic saviors. 'Life of Brian' was the name of the movie, and as soon as it was released quickly became known as one of the funniest and most controversial works done by the Pythons, and not without a reason!The movie's plot is obviously, about the life of Brain Cohen (Graham Chapman), who is a poor Jewish boy who was born in Nazareth on the same day as Jesus. Years later, Brian is now a young man who has grown hating the Roman occupation of his country while working at the local Arena. One day Brian attends one of Jesus' sermons and among the crowd he notices Judith (Sue Jones-Davies), a woman who leads him to the rebel group 'People's Front of Judea'. Brian joyfully joins the rebels, but the missions given to him do not exactly end in the best way for the group. Things get complicated for Brian when after a bizarre series of circumstances, he ends up being confused with a messiah, and with this he gains an considerable amount of 'devoted followers'.The first thing one notices about 'Life of Brian' when compared to the Pythons' previous movie is how structured is the plot. While of course 'Holy Grail' had the running theme of King Arthur, it was still a series of sketches tied together by their style and themes. 'Life of Brian' shows the Python style of comedy completely adapted to a cleverly written and well structured narrative that, with their usual mix of witty satire and surreal nonsense, showcases their ideas about organized religions as well as the other social themes (government and other political satire for example) they tend to use. Very fresh and original, the comedy in 'Life of Brian' is top notch, and takes what started in the now legendary 'Flying Circus' to a whole new level. Contrary to what could be thought, the structured narrative enhances the comedy instead of limit it, and makes for a more focused piece of work.Python member Terry Jones takes again the director's seat (without Terry Gilliam this time), and makes the Python's masterpiece come to life, remaining true to its roots without sacrificing the film's structure. While it's obvious that Jones knows that the film's power is in the script and the cast, he allows himself to showcase his love for ancient history and, taking advantage of the budget (and the locations of 'Jesus of Nazareth'), he sets the wacky story of Brian in a lavish and very realist Jerusalem. The sharp contrast between Jones' care for some historical accuracy and the script's bizarre and surreal humor truly adds a lot to the 'Pythonesque' atmosphere of the film, as it feels oddly appropriate within the satiric tone of the movie. With a style more focused on the characters than in the visuals, Jones was the natural choice to direct 'Life of Brian', as its truly the characters what makes the movie the jewel of British humor.And as always, the Pythons are simply superb in their portrayal of the many characters of the movie. Graham Chapman only plays three this time, but he is Brian, and as our main character he perfectly portrays the naivetÃ© of the young idealist man. John Cleese is also excellent in the many characters he plays, specially as the leader of the People's Front of Judea. Director Terry Jones himself appears as, among others, Brian's mother, making a remarkable character with his peculiar falsetto voice. While I can't single out an actor as the best in the film, I must say that Michael Palin's performance as Pontius Pilate is easily one of the funniest of the movie. Finally, Eric Idle gives the icing in the cake as he sings the Python's most famous song, 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life'.If 'Life of Brian' has a fault, it would be that it may feel too long to those unfamiliar with Monty Python's style of humor. That said, this movie is probably the easiest to 'get' as it lacks the surreal randomness of 'Holy Grail' or the darkness of the sketches in 'Meaning of Life', making it the ideal introduction to Python's humor. I can't write about 'Life of Brian' without talking about the 'controversies' it met after released, as it was accused of being blasphemous and disrespectful to God. While the film is indeed irreverent, it is in no way an attack to God, it is more a satire on the way some religious people follow their leaders blindly without really thinking about it. There is nothing blasphemous in the movie, and it is more humanist than irreligious.Monty Python's style has proved to be one of the most influential in the history of British comedy, and personally I think that 'Life of Brian' is the crowning achievement of their career. The brilliant satire they cleverly put in the movie's script is easily one of the best in history of film, as it's as merciless as it is funny. Zany, irreverent and wild, 'Life of Brian' can stand proudly as the Python's movie masterpiece, and while sadly they only made one film after this, it's always better to look on the bright side of life and see it as the testament of their genius. 10/10",10,4,9,3 April 2007
Dawn of the Dead," Almost as good as the original!
","Young director Zack Snyder risked everything he had with this remake of George Romero's classic zombie movie, and he hit the jackpot. Snyder not only makes a movie that is as good as the original, he develops the story in a different direction and makes a movie that will be remembered as a classic on its own merit.The basic premise of Romero's original screenplay is here, a group of people uses a mall as a fortress during the outbreak of the zombie epidemic; nevertheless, Snyder takes a more action-oriented approach to the story focusing in the fight for survival, instead of the social cometary Romero always gives.While purists may call this a cheap change to make the movie more appealing, I believe that Snyder's work is really a good rework of the story. Sure, it is true that the fast action that the movie delivers gives few room to explore the characters the way Romero used to do, Snyder makes the whole trouble a bit more realistic, by pushing the claustrophobic tension to the limit.The acting is for the most part very good, and while the characters are not really very well developed, the performances of the cast really make up for it.A single expression of Ving Rhames says more than a thousand lines of script. He is truly an underrated actor. Sarah Polley and Jake Weber are very convincing as unlikely survivors of this apocalypse and while not as good as Rhames, both of them have very good chemistry.The SFX are very good, frightening and convincing, and to add my two cents to the famous debate about the 'running zombies', I think that they work very good in the context of the movie and serve the purpose that Snyder had in mind.Sadly, not everything is perfect, as certain subplots are somewhat absurd and out of place in the movie, also, the lack of development of the characters at times hurts the film, in the sense that one would like to know more about the characters and their motivations; nevertheless, it is fair to point out that there is more good than bad, and that the feeling after the movie is the one of entire satisfaction.The dawn of the Dead remake is a movie that lives up to the expectation, and respectfully follows the path of the original in its transformation into a genre classic by its own merit.8/10. Awesome debut for Snyder.",8,0,0,28 December 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Bloody awesome! Best comedy of the year!
","Sometimes a man just needs a little bit of motivation to fix the problems of life, and what better motivation than a bunch of zombies? Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a guy who has just been dump by his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) because of his lack of ambitions. Stuck in a dead end job and in a constant fight with his step father, Shaun can only rely on his good old friend Ed (Nick Frost) and the old pub they frequent, the Winchester. When zombies appear and begin to wreak havoc, Shaun decides this may be the chance to prove Liz that he can be a man and goes on a quest to rescue her, and take her to the Winchester.That's basically the plot of Edgar Wright's brilliant romantic-zombie comedy, 'Shaun of the Dead'. Straight from the great sitcom 'Spaced', Wright & Pegg have written what could be, the best comedy of the year, and one of the funniest movies of all time. 'Shaun of the Dead' is basically a romantic comedy happening in the middle of Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead', with all the clichÃ©s of both genres, but included in very intelligent and funny ways.Simon Pegg shines in his character as Shaun, with a performance so good that makes the character truly believable as a loser who must grow and get things done. Nick Frost as Ed is the perfect companion to Pegg, and their chemistry is quite great. Shaun and Ed probably will go down in history as one of the best comedy team in movies.The supporting characters are awesome too and nobody gives a bad performance. Brilliant is the work of Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran as Liz' best friends, and while Kate Ashfield is probably the weakest link, her performance is still up to the challenge.The make-up and SFX, essential in a zombie movie, are top-notch and the care taken by director Wright show his truly respect for the genre he is making fun of in his movie. The film delivers its good share of gore and blood and is also filled with references to classic movies of the genre. Horror fans will be pleased with 'Shaun of the Dead'.Overall, 'Shaun of the Dead' is now a modern classic, joining classics such as 'Brainead' and 'Return of the Living Dead' as films that set the standards for comedy/horror. 9/10.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Non-stop action and great entertainment
","Three years after the surprising success of Disney's swashbuckling adventure inspired by the theme park ride 'Pirates of the Caribbean', a new adventure of the gang of buccaneers appeared on the big screen with higher expectations than the ones its predecessor faced. While it lacks the originality and 'surprise factor' of the first film, it's safe to say that Gore Verbinski's new entry on the series fulfill the expectations nicely and delivers its fair share of entertainment and adventure with a joy rarely seen on screen. It may not be a perfect film, but it's one of the most entertaining and funny adventures of the last years.The story begins with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)'s wedding canceled when the couple is arrested for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in his escape. Sentenced to death, Will is offered a chance to save their lives, he must bring Jack Sparrow and his magic compass to the hands of Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and the East India Company. At the same time, Sparrow faces troubles of his own, as he has a debt to pay to the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the supernatural captain of the ghostly ship named 'The Flying Dutchman'. Will and Jack's interests will conflict and a quest will start for the Dead Man's Chest, a mysterious artifact that holds the key to their salvation.Written again by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the film continues delivering the same style of swashbuckling action and light-hearted comedy that made the first one successful. With the advantage of having the characters already established, the film goes straight to the action and turns the 'Pirates' series into an epic quest that without a doubt will be fulfilled in the third entry of the now trilogy. This is probably a two sided blade, as unlike the first film, this one serves as a build up for the third and could be said that it lacks a proper conclusion following the style of movie serials of old or more recently, the 'Star Wars' series.Director Gore Verbinski once again becomes the mastermind behind this ambitious sequel, and carefully builds up the epic adventure taking it to the realms of fantasy with the aid of very good special effects creating incredible monsters and supernatural creatures. This mixture of historical setting and fantasy elements is nothing new, as the first one had its share of it, however, here the effects are bigger and of greater importance, although surprisingly, not entirely overwhelming. Verbinski's daring mix of special effects and extensive plot is risky, but fortunately it ends on a positive note.Johnny Depp once again leads the show, and while certainly both Bloom and Knightley have improved, they still look overshadowed by the imposing presence of Depp's talent. The addition of Bill Nighy is an excellent one, and he manages to challenge Depp's domain of the film and successfully steals every scene he is in. Even with his face completely covered with Computer effects, Nighy delivers a performance on the level of the best swashbuckling villains of all time. The rest of the cast remains basically the same as in the previous movie with few improvements, although Stellan Skarsgård surprises as the ghostly incarnation of Will Turner's father.'Dead Man's Chest' is a very entertaining and well-done film, but it has some severe flaws that by now most critics have pointed out. For once, it's the overlong runtime, that wouldn't be a real problem if it weren't for the fact that some unnecessary scenes are the ones that cause this extensive runtime. Particularly the introductory scenes seem to go forever making the rest of the film look rushed and some character's decision seem out of character. While some have criticized the plot as 'incoherent', personally I think that it's very good despite its slow and overlong start.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' may not change the world of cinema, nor leave an everlasting impact as the previous entry; but at least it serves as the beginning of a new adventure that explores this romantic idealization of the pirate's life. It's great escapism and healthy entertainment that hopefully will have a terrific conclusion in part three. 7/10",7,1,3,4 September 2006
Hostel," A nice effort by Roth
","2002 was a big year for director Eli Roth, as the huge success of his modest debut film, the low-budget horror 'Cabin Fever', quickly gave him the attention of a young audience eager of horror films aimed to their generation. While not exactly an original or exceptional film, Roth's 'Cabin Fever' became a huge hit among the audience because it offered an edgier, raw approach that proved to be very attractive to die hard horror fans, but at the same time was friendly enough to gather the mainstream audiences not entirely familiar with the genre. It was this success that attracted producer Quentin Tarantino to help Roth to make the follow-up to his initial success. The 2005 release of 'Hostel' was the result of that joint venture and the movie that showed that Roth is finally growing up as a horror director.'Hostel' is the story of Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), two backpackers traveling across Europe during their last summer before going to college, in a wild trip of drugs and sex. In their quest, their are joined by Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), an Icelander traveler who is also looking for good experiences. During one night on Amsterdam, the three travelers meet Alex (Lubomir Bukovy), a young man who tells them about a hostel located in Slovakia where they will find not only the best looking women of all Europe, but also the ones that are easier to get into bed. Excited about this information, Paxton, Josh and Oli travel to Slovakia to discover the paradise Alex was talking about. But they will also discover a dark side of the business that Alex conveniently forgot to tell them.Written by Roth himself, 'Hostel' is at its core, a very basic tale of punishment as the young protagonists go from lustful consumers to products of consumption by their own choice; however, it's commendable the effort Roth has put to the development of the characters to give some flesh and make the simple story a bit more engaging. The lack of sympathetic or well-built characters was one of the most criticized aspects of 'Cabin Fever', but in 'Hostel', Roth creates a trio of characters that while at first are like Xerox copies from his 'Cabin Fever' boys, later they evolve into real persons with realistic motivations and surprisingly heart, proving that the director/writer has learned something from his past mistakes.It's important to point out that its hype as an extremely violent movie is deceiving, as it really doesn't offer anything new or groundbreaking to old and experienced horror fans familiar with lesser known gems of the exploitation genre. That said, 'Hostel' is a visually impressive movie (thanks to its bigger budget) that showcases a stylish yet very realistic way of violence rarely seen in the current mainstream horror. As a director, Eli Roth follows a straight forward approach to his story that in many ways is the obvious evolution of his work in 'Cabin Fever', as even when this new film is definitely more brutal and remorseless than his previous work; it also offers a slightly friendly face that makes it attractive to bigger audiences outside the traditional horror fan base.The cast of the film does a commendable job, but never goes beyond the expected. Jay Hernandez is probably the best of the main cast, giving a believable turn as the naive American who gets in the middle of something bigger than himself. While he is good in his role, his character loses all credibility by the last third of the movie due to the sadly unrealistic way Roth ends the film. Derek Richardson is pretty good too, as the less enthusiastic and introverted Josh. Eythor Gudjonsson as Oli exudes his natural charm in a role that is probably an exaggeration of his real life persona. Jan Vlasák gives a terrific performance in what's probably the best acting of the film. The rest of the cast is pretty much OK, without any real surprises.As written above, it is Roth who is the main responsible for the fatal flaw of the film: it's conclusion. 'Hostel' is divided basically in three acts, and sadly it's in the final part where Roth decides to conclude his story in a way so fantastic that betrays the realist approach he had used in the film so far. Without spoiling the finale, I'll just say that the unfortunate decision makes the film look like a complete different movie and totally unbalances what otherwise could had been a new classic. 'Hostel' has been criticized by the naive and ignorant view it has on Slovakia and other European countries in their portrayal as poor countries where life is cheap. While Roth has defended himself by saying his film is done that way on purpose, personally I think that the ambiguity the film has on this aspect (it's very realistic at times, while over-the-top fantastical at others) doesn't really help Roth to make his point clear.Wheter it is a socially aware film or not, the fact is that with 'Hostel' director Eli Roth gained another financial success and proved that he was more than a lucky one hit wonder. While not a movie without flaws (and it has some serious problems), 'Hostel' is a big improvement over 'Cabin Fever', and hopefully Roth will make a masterpiece if someone else writes instead of him. 7/10",6,2,4,8 January 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Even when it almost takes itself too seriously to be fun, it still is an enjoyable experience
","Andrew Adamson, who gave us animated gems such as Shrek and Shrek 2, directs his first movie involving real actors with mixed results. The first entry in C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia is certainly a good movie to watch, but somehow lacks the magic of movies that stay with you after the film is over.It's not easy to adapt a famous book, but in that aspect Adamson and his team of scriptwriters manage to stay faithful to the novel although still the story has suffered a few minor changes. The plot is simple, four siblings travel to a magical world using an old wardrobe, they will have to free the land of Narnia from the eternal winter that Jadis, the White Witch has sent.The acting is good for the most part; experienced actress Tilda Swinton dwells more into mainstream movies and give her usual great performance as the White Witch, giving power to a character that is always diminished by the majestic Aslan, who clearly is the star. Liam Neeson does a good job as his voice, giving him dignity, but at the same time it focuses in the messianic side of the character.This would not be a bad thing if it not were by the fact that Adamson focuses more in those aspects of the story, leaving poor development for the children and the adventure aspect of it. Too much time is given to how great Aslan is, that there is few time to explore that sense of adventure every kid has in it.The movie takes itself too serious as an epic to a point that it almost forgets is aimed for the fun of younger audiences. It feels as if they were trying to make the story a new 'Lord of the Rings' epic when the story doesn't go that way. Fortunately, this never gets too serious to become a problem and the movie still manages to be entertaining.The film is not a masterpiece, but it can be entertaining for younger audiences. Do not believe the hype, it's not a perfect movie, just go to the theaters with an open mind, and don't expect any more than entertainment. 7/10",7,0,0,12 December 2005
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Very good for a sequel
","At first, 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' looks like the inevitable sequel to the famous 20th Century Fox animated blockbuster, trying to cash in the success of the previous movie. Well, despite being exactly that, this new adventure of the prehistoric mammals manages to stay on its own legs and delivers nothing but great fun becoming a worthy sequel. That alone is an achievement in its own right.After some years living in peace in a new pack, our old friends Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego the Sabertooth tiger (Dennis Leary) discover that the ice is melting and a flood will cover the valley they now call home. Soon they organize a migration, but the trip won't be easy, specially for Manny, who begins to believe that he is the last Mammoth on earth.'The Meltdown' continues with the style of its predecessor both in humor and animation, so those who fell in love with the original will love the sequel too. The difference however, is in the fact that now Manny is our main character. We get to know more about this character apparently anti-social and cynic, but who in the inside feels very lonely after the loss of his family. Sid and Diego make good sidekicks in this adventure and while their roles in the film are somewhat diminished, they still are very well-developed characters. Scrat, the nut-obsessed squirrel is back too in his constant quest for his lost nut, giving slapstick humor of the finest type in every scene he is in.It is always hard for sequels to live up to the expectations, specially in family-oriented animation films, but director Carlos Saldanha and his team manage to make a funny movie that never gets boring or tiresome (something vital as it is a movie mainly oriented for kids).While probably the story is not exactly original or complicated, writers Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow make up for it with good character development and funny one-liners that fit the movie tone very good. Two new characters, the young possums Crash (Sean William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) are a welcomed addition to the family, as well as Ellie (Queen Latifah), the lost mammoth.Ellie, Manny and their relationship is a very important subplot in the movie, and one that was perfectly handled by the director and his crew. While Diego's subplot was also interesting and served as basis for very good jokes, it didn't had enough screen-time; a shame in my opinion, but overall the movie was very good.To summarize, fans of the first 'Ice Age' won't be disappointed by 'The Meltdown', and sure the movie will give laughs to both kids and their parents. While still not as good as the first one, this sequel breaks the 'sequel's curse' and is an entertaining film on its own right. 7/10",7,42,59,11 April 2006
Oldboy," Visually stunning, no doubt about that, but....
","Many things have been written about this Korean movie, both praising it and bashing it. I just watched it for the first time and found a movie that, even when it's not perfect, it's definitely worth a look, at least so one can make an opinion about it.The plot is well known these days, a man is locked in an apartment for 15 years, and has 5 days to get his revenge. Very simple, and very complex at the same time. What has this man done to be locked like that? Why is he released after 15 years? and why doe she have the chance to get a revenge? These questions are what drives the main character, Oh-Dae-Su, and the questions that keep the suspense among the audience.Adapted from a Manga(Japanese comic), the film's beautiful camera work and outstanding direction really create a visually stunning piece of art. There are scenes full of surrealism that really display a visual poetry and flow like water, thanks to a near-perfect edition. The infamous corridor scene must be seen to be believed.The acting is for the most part good, and we really feel for Dae-Su, who is some sort of bizarre Count of Montecristo. We go from this regular guy who after 15 years of torture turns into a subhuman being, a monster as he calls himself, a pawn in a game that he doesn't know. It's a very Kafkian feeling.The main criticism to the film goes to the way the script is developed. It's not really a bad script, but the story unfolds in a way that leaves the audience unsatisfied. I won't spoil a thing, but it has to do with the fact that one ends up wondering if the revenge had any sense.Personally, I'm not sure if the cultural differences are responsible of this, but I felt that when the motif of Dae-Su's 15 year torture is revealed, the movie loses steam and wraps up the wrong way. Maybe it's because western audiences are used to a more active attitude towards revenge, but somehow it doesn't live up to the expectation. As I wrote above, one ends feeling that everything had no sense at all.Nevertheless, and putting that aside, 'Oldboy' is still a movie worth a view, if only for the astounding camera work and the solid direction. Watch it with an open mind and make your own opinion of it.Solid 7.5/10",8,5,71,25 November 2005
Brokeback Mountain," A new classic love story
","While probably 'Brokeback Mountain' is one of the most controversial movies of the last times; at its core, it is like those classic movies of old, a beautifully told story of doomed love and its somewhat tragic consequences. It is also the tale of one man's problem with his own emotions and the conflicts he has when he tries to live a double life.'Brokeback Mountain' tells the story of the relationship between two cowboys who met each other while working in Brokeback mountain on the summer of 1963. We follow their relationship first as friends, then as lovers who must keep their love secret. Through the eyes of Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), we discover the conflicts that his secret love for Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) creates in his life; and how he must face his inner fears to avoid damaging everyone he meets.Even when the topic at hand still is seen as taboo in this days, Ang Lee's adaptation of Annie Proulx's short-story is not the definitive 'gay' movie; people of every sexual orientation can relate to the characters and the situations they go through. This is one of the movie's biggest strengths, the fact that it portrays very human and realistic characters. Neither Ennis nor Jack are bi-dimensional cartoons; each is a complex world on its own and the central point of the story is when those two worlds collide.Heath Ledger's performance is vital for this movie to succeed, as he is our eyes in this venture. We witness how he chooses the easy way out and marries a local girl instead of staying with his true love Jack, creating with this decision a problem that will grow as big as their love, and that they'll have to face eventually. The movie is not only about Ennis and Jack, is about Ennis personal growth and how to achieve the emotional maturity he must endure difficult tests in his life.Gyllenhaal is also great as Jack Twist, but definitely the movie belongs to Ledger. Same can be said of Michelle Williams, as Ennis's heartbroken wife Alma, who can't understand what is going wrong with their marriage. Her performance is powerful, and at times she manages to overshadow Ledger with her perfect portray of the emotions of this devastated woman.Aesthetically, the movie is wonderful. Ang Lee does for Wyoming's mountains what he did for China's exotic landscapes in his previous masterpiece 'Wo Hun Cang Long'; he manage to showcase nature in a way that appears new, pure and irremediably beautiful. Together with Gustavo Santaolalla subtle but effective score, create a perfect image that reflects both the beautiful and the lonely sides of Ennis' life.The saddest thing of this movie, is that most people will get immersed in the homosexual-controversy, and will lost the beautiful message of the movie. It is not about homosexuals or heterosexuals, it is about love between two human beings. It is a shame that this modern classic of romance, will be remembered for it's controversy rather than for its artistic value. 8/10",8,15,17,20 March 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Back to the glory days of disaster movies
","Director Roland Emmerich's new blockbuster, 'The Day After Tomorrow', is a small surprise in this days of big budget movies with zero brains and little or no value. Emmerich has mastered the blockbuster techniques and delivers entertainment at its purest form. Sure, 'The Day After Tomorrow' is not a masterpiece of film-making, and it willingly sacrifices realism for dramatic purposes; nevertheless, it follows its pattern and delivers simple minded entertainment complete with social message.'The Day After Tomorrow' is a throw back to the days of the disaster movies of the 70s, movies where a natural disaster was used as a plot device to make dramatic scenes of survival and triumph of the human spirit spiced up with romance and family values.Like its predecessors 'Earthquake' (1974), 'Avalanche' (1978) and even 'The Poseidon Adventure' (1972), the movie bases its plot in a disaster; in this case, a climatic change that creates a new ice age. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) is a scientist that has been studying the weather; being the first that discovered the change, he gets frustrated as his predictions come true faster than he thought and the U.S. government does nothing to protect the people. things get complicated when he finds out that his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in one of the cities that will be more affected by the storm: New York.Just as a classic disaster movie, 'The Day After Tomorrow' makes a display of special effects in order to portray the magnitude of the disaster. In this aspect, Emmerich succeeds as the weather effects are presented in an accurate (albeit very exaggerated) way. However, it is fair to point out that Emmerich went too far at including computer generated wolves instead of real wolves.The acting is pretty much standard for this kind of movies, nothing spectacular. Quaid and Gyllenhaal are good on their roles, but those were not particularly demanding roles. Rossum is quite average at best, probably her real thing is the singing like she demonstrated in 'Phantom of the Opera'. However, much of this could also be blamed to the script, that follows the formulaic pattern of the disaster movie.As usual, Emmerich does a good job directing an action movie, he has a good eye for action sequences and heavy use of special effects; while his handling of dramatic scenes still is forced and again, formulaic, it has increased a lot since his days of 'Independence Day'.To summarize, 'The Day After Tomorrow' is a good entertaining movie but nothing more than that. It has received a lot of undeserving bashing lately but it is a good movie in its own terms. It is not a masterpiece, but what else could be expected of a blockbuster? 6/10.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A fitting finale...
","When in 2002 rumors began to be spread about a movie based on Disneyland's classic dark ride, 'Pirates of the Caribbean', nobody expected that any good would come out of it. However, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' was released and against all odds became a success that surpassed all the expectations. The movie, a tale of fantasy, romance and swashbuckling adventures that chronicled the escapades of a group of 18th Century pirates, earned both critical and commercial praise due to its fresh take on the genre. Due to its success, two back-to-back sequels were announced, both with the same cast and crew of the first film. The first of those sequels was 'Dead Man's Chest', a film that while certainly lacked a lot of the original's power, started a new and interesting story arc that has its grand finale in 'At World's End'.'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' continues where the second part ended: with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) making an uneasy alliance with former foe Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in order to find a way to bring Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) back from 'Davy Jones' Locker' the supernatural purgatory for those indentured to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). The urgency of their mission comes from the fact that Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company, has begun to purge pirates from the sea, organizing massive executions in an attempt to control worldwide sea trade. To face Beckett, the nine pirate lords must make up the Brethren Court, but since Sparrow, pirate lord of the Caribbean, was unable to appoint a successor, our friends must bring him back before its too late.Once again, the film was written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, who continue the story arc that began in the previous film with an extremely detailed script that gives closure to many of the plots that were started by the previous two films. To do this, the writers employ a series of convoluted twists and turns that further explore the now complicated relationships between our heroes, who not only must survive Beckett's attacks, but also the consequences of their own choices and betrayals. Unlike the second film, this film is more focused on the characters than on the action scenes, in an obvious attempt to add more character development this time; however, this doesn't mean that the movie lacks in the action department, as there is plenty of it through the film. Of course, the movie keeps good doses of that special touch of humor that has given the franchise a lot of its charm.As in the previous two installments, director Gore Verbinski takes the helm again and brings this adventure come to life in a very visually appealing way. With an extreme care for details and a great eye for visual compositions, Verbinski creates a sequel that manages to overcome the disappointment of the previous film, returns the story to its roots and concludes the series on a high note. Keeping a good pace despite the long runtime, Verbinski adequately handles the dialog based scenes and the action sequences in a well balanced way (with much better results than in Part 2) that even his extensive use of the remarkable special effects doesn't come off as over the top. It is clear in this film that while a mostly visual director, Verbinski knows a thing or two about film history, as at times he manages to capture the feeling of those classics about pirates with Errol Flynn or Charles Laughton in the main roles.By now it is more than clear that Johnny Depp's character, Captain Jack Sparrow, is the driving force of the film. Once again Depp becomes the quirky yet charming pirate with great ease and talent, delivering a terrific comedic performance that still remains fun after all those years. Orlando Bloom isn't that lucky, as while he has improved as an actor, the writers have left his character in a third position after Keira Knightley, who in this chapter gets a lot of screen time and carries a considerable part of the film alone. This would be good if it wasn't for the fact that Knightley isn't as accomplished as an actress as those around her, as not only Depp manages to overshadow her, but the combined presences of Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy and Yun-Fat Chow prove to be too much a challenge for her. Among the cast Rush is a real joy to watch, as he steals every scene he is in.Sadly, despite the many improvements that 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' has over its predecessor, it is also plagued by some of the flaws that brought down 'Dead Man's Chest'. It's main flaw is probably the enormous dependence the film has on the charm that the character of Jack Sparrow has over the audience. The writers know that Sparrow is a fan favorite, so they put a lot of the film over his shoulders, which results in many great scenes with him, but also in the belittling of the rest of the characters. The convoluted plot will definitely turn some off, but I think that the complex storyline added a lot of much needed character development to the film, specially as it allowed some characters a small chance to shine. Finally, I will only add that the script gets corny and silly at times, but not too much to be a real bother.While not exactly a great artistic accomplishment, 'At World's End' is a roller-coaster of fun that despite its long runtime never fails to be entertaining. It is unknown what is ahead for the successful 'Pirates' franchise, but one thing is clear for me: the story arc that began in 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' has a most satisfying finale in 'At World's End'. Fans of this series will be pleased. 8/10",6,3,6,28 May 2007
Zodiac," Haunting
","Among the many cases of serial killers that have become part of popular culture over the years, the case of the Zodiac killer is probably the most intriguing and fascinating of the modern era due to fact that, like the infamous British killer, Jack the Ripper, the Zodiac was never caught and his identity remains a mystery to this day. Operating in Northern California, the Zodiac Killer terrorized the region in the late 60s and early 70s, murdering at least 5 people (although he claimed there were more) during the decade. However, what made the Zodiac so intriguing was the fact that he began to send a series of taunting letters to the press and the police, challenging them and including cryptograms with hidden messages. Almost 40 years later, the case caught the interest of scriptwriter James Vanderbilt and director David Fincher, who fascinated by Robert Graysmith's book about the case, decided to adapt it to the big screen.'Zodiac' is a careful reconstruction of the Zodiac killer case, following the members of the press and the police whom got involved through course of the investigation. After attacking Darlene Ferrin ( Ciara Hughes) and Mike Mageau (Lee Norris) at Vallejo, the Zodiac sends his first letter to the local police and three newspapers where he claims responsibility over the crime. At the San Francisco Chronicle, journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) becomes the top crime reporter on the case, while at the same time cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes an interest on the cryptograms sent by the killer. Graysmith's interest will take him from aiding Avery in his work to actively investigating the case on his own by following Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo). However, his work on the Zodiac killer will begin to take its toll on his own homely life. And the crimes continue.Written by James Vanderbilt, the movie follows very closely the detailed accounts of the case as they appear in Robert Graysmith's book and police reports. Due to this extreme care for realism, 'Zodiac' is more a police procedural film than a typical movie about serial killers, as in this film the story focuses on those who are following the criminal instead of on the victims or the criminal himself. As the crime never had a proper 'conclusion', Vanderbilt wisely makes his story not only about the puzzle itself, but also adds touches about the dramatic consequences of obsessing over an impossible to solve mystery. While long and intricate, the development of the story is remarkably good in its narrative, as the slow way clues are unveiled helps to keep the suspense rising and makes the plot captivating and never boring.While Vanderbilt is truly responsible for a lot of the film's narrative structure, it was Fincher who decided to take a realistic approach in their conception of the film, and this can also be seen in the visual aspect of the movie. With extreme and meticulous care and Harris Savides' excellent cinematography, Fincher recreates not only the look of early 70s California, but also the tense atmosphere of paranoia and distrust that the Zodiac killer created among the population during his reign of terror. As written above, the storyline moves slowly, but Fincher successfully manages to keep a good pace while also presenting all the facts of the case. Finally, while this is not an action packed movie, Fincher creates a series of extremely effective scenes of suspense, where thanks to a subtle use of atmosphere and mood, he brings back the real horrors of the Zodiac killer.The acting is another of the film's strong points, as even when there wasn't a serious exploration of the characters (the film was more about how the case affected them), the cast was simply outstanding in their roles. The always effective Robert Downey Jr. makes an excellent job as reporter Paul Avery, and even adds touches of dark humor that makes Avery look more human. However, the highlight of the film is Mark Ruffalo, who as Inspector David Toschi, delivers his best performance so far and proves his worth as an actor. While at times overshadowed by both Downey and Ruffalo, Jake Gyllenhaal remains effective and makes a good job as cartoonist Robert Graysmith. 'Zodiac' is also benefited by the excellent performances of the supporting cast, which includes Chloë Sevigny, Elias Koteas, Anthony Edwards, and John Carroll Lynch making a haunting performance as Arthur Leigh Allen.Probably the film's worst enemy will be the misconceptions created by its marketing team, as this is definitely not the typical movie about serial killers, 'Zodiac' is a movie about the terror the Zodiac spawned and the consequences it had in a group of people. Audiences expecting a flashy horror movie like Fincher's previous film, 'Se7en', will be sorely disappointed, 'Zodiac' is definitely a different kind of beast. The long runtime and slow pace the movie has will definitely be another of the elements that may cause some discomfort; although as written above, Fincher managed to keep the movie moving with a good rhythm. Finally, some may also be disappointed by the way the plot reaches its conclusion, but given the fact that the case remains unsolved, it was truly the best way to do it without compromising historical accuracy.Perfectly crafted thanks to a solid work of writing and directing, 'Zodiac' is definitely one of director David Fincher's best films. It is a movie that reveals him as a mature director and proves that the promise he showed in 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club' wasn't a case of luck. It may be too early too tell by now, but in my opinion, 'Zodiac' will go on history as one of the finest police procedural films ever made. 8/10",8,0,2,12 June 2007
Silent Hill," Very good and atmospheric horror film...
","Based on a very successful series of horror video-games, 'Silent Hill' is a new entry on the horror genre that has the challenge of surpassing the high expectations built due to the video-game's fame and status as one of the best series ever done. Not an easy task for a film (and one that hasn't been fulfilled by many films based on video-games), however, the highly anticipated film by french director Christophe Gans has proved to be up to the challenge and quickly has earned a cult-following even among fans without gaming experience.The movie keeps the premise of the game series (it focuses on the key plot of the first video game) but enough changes have been done to keep it original enough to fans of the game and still easy-to-follow for non-fans. The plot revolves around the Da Silva family, whose little daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) is suffering from bizarre nightmares about a town named 'Silent Hill'. While her father, Christopher (Sean Bean) trusts in psychology, her mother Rose (Radha Mitchell) doesn't and takes Sharon to Silent Hill in order to discover the mystery of her daughter's nightmares. What she'll find there will be a nightmare come true.Written by Roger Avary, the movie's screenplay is what could be stated as an update to the first game's plot, with new things added and others changed. The most important one is that the lead character is now a female rather than a male, this change was a very appropriate one as it focuses on a mother-child relationship, a bond considerably stronger in the western culture than the father-child bond. The film keeps the feeling of isolation and the nightmarish atmospheres although it tones down the mystery and exploration of the town (another obvious change). It also has a small dose of drama, which came up as a good surprise as not many modern horror films seem to care for it nowadays.Christophe Gans' conception of 'Silent Hill' is a very beautiful work of art. Like in his previous work, the visual composition is amazing and 'Silen Hill''s mix of haunting loneliness and menacing darkness is wonderfully portrayed. Gans' care for details and love for the video game are notorious as some scenes seem to be taken shot by shot from it. While it still has its fair share of gore and other cheap thrills, for the most part the films relays on atmosphere and mood rather than in graphic violence. However, it's safe to say that it's biggest problems occur when it moves away from that style.The acting is for the most part good, with Radha Mitchell being an excellent choice for a lead character and shows her talent for drama as well as for horror. She carries the film with elegance and is very believable as a worried mother. Sean Bean is credited as co-star, but his presence is small and while he gives a fine performance, the real co-star is definitely Laurie Holden. As Cybil Bennet (a cop who follows Rose to Silent Hill), Holden is very effective and overall makes a good job. Deborah Kara Unger as Dahlia is somewhat disappointing, not only because her character is quite poorly developed, but also her performance ends up as weak.The problem with 'Silent Hill' are not the high expectations it built (relatively, it satisfied most of them), but the potential it left unexploited. The story is a fitting adaptation but still some of the magic is missing there and some details appear as flaws. The focus on apparently unnecessary characters (Christopher) contrasts with the poor development of more important ones such as Dahlia. As written above, while the film is for the most part an atmospheric Gothic film, when it moves to a gorier graphical film the results are less impressive and the massive use of CGI at times makes an otherwise beautiful looking film appear as of lesser quality.Depsite this flaws, 'Silent Hill' is a terrific film and a very enjoyable one for fans of slower, creepier films. It's not a gore-fest so fans expecting fast action will be sorely disappointed. It's true that its not a perfect film, but its a good attempt at making Gothic horror the way it used to be. 7/10",7,2,3,24 July 2006
Scary Movie 2," Unnecessary and disappointing...
","'Scary Movie', was a somewhat breath of fresh air in the year 2000, with a concept in the tradition of 'Airplane!'. Making a movie that parodies every cliché of the late 90s teen horror genre like 'Scream' and 'I know what you did last summer' seemed like good fun. The Wayans brothers hit the target with their particular brand of crude humor that was very attractive to the MTV generation of the end of the last century.A year after, they broke their promise of no sequels with this movie focused on the big CGI horror movies like the remakes of 'The Haunting' and 'Thirtheen Ghosts' as well as other popular movies of the time, keeping the crude humor and the sex jokes in the same style as the original; the difference being that, as any sequel, there is the more of everything.Actually those two aspects are the main problems in the film; first, the popular culture references are only funny if one is familiar with those, and also become dated quickly as the time goes on. The comedy aspect of the film, unlike the original movie, is very weak, with most gags being repetitive and masking the movie tiresome. Sure, the Wayans are a very creative team and still can make a laugh, but in this movie it feels as if they had written the script on a hurry and without caring too much on the result.The acting is mediocre at best, with Anna Faris being again not only our lead character, but also the only one who knows how to give a good performance. Such a shame that her most famous role to date is as the lead star of this series of films, because she is a real talent on the rise. The rest of the cast is unconvincing and even the Wayans brothers seem bothered by their own script. The brilliant cameo by James Woods at the beginning of the film is among the few really enjoyable moments of the film.The special effects are far better than in the first one; having a bigger budget helps and director Keenen Ivory Wayans makes good use of them. Unlike the horror movies it parodies, 'Scary Movie 2' doesn't abuse of CGI and at times it keeps the indie-look of the first one.The first 'Scary movie' promised no sequels. If they had stayed true to their promise, maybe 'Scary Movie' had been remembered as a jewel product of its time and not as the multi-sequel bore that is right now. 4/10",4,0,1,20 March 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautifully haunting masterpiece
","It seems as if it was just yesterday when a young Mexican director named Guillermo Del Toro sold his house in order to get enough money to complete his first feature length movie, 'Cronos'. Now, more than 10 years later, Guillermo Del Toro finally has created what many (himself included) call 'his masterpiece', and to the surprise of many, they are not wrong. 'El Laberinto Del Fauno', Del Toro's 6th movie, is truly a wonderful film deeply rooted in the director's favorite genres: horror and fantasy. A modern fairytale, 'El Laberinto del Fauno' is a remarkable achievement that probably, is just the beginning of a new stage in this courageous and imaginative director.Set in Spain in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, 'El Laberinto del Fauno' is the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl who travels with her mother (Ariadna Gil) to a rural area to meet her mother's new husband, the Captain Vidal (Sergi López). But Ofelia is not very happy with her mother's decision, as the Captain is a very strict and evil man who serves Franco's fascist regime and enjoys to hunt the remaining rebel forces. In the middle of this post-war nightmare, Ofelia finds an ancient labyrinth that is the path to a magical world of faeries and monsters.In 'El Laberinto Del Fauno', Del Toro once again dives into the fantastic genres he loves so much, this time exploring the nature of fairy tales, taking them back to its original roots, when fantasy tales were grim, dark and violent. The contrast between the post-war scenery and the fantastic world Ofelia is about to enter is just the first display of the duality motif, constantly present through the film. However, this is more complex than a mere 'good versus evil' tale, it's about Ofelia's quest for her place in a world filled with the chaos and confusion of war. Deconstructing the hero's journey, Del Toro takes Ofelia through the classic outline of the three tasks she must complete to be able to enter the fantasy realm, with the Faun (Doug Jones) acting as judge and guide.Visually, Del Toro's film is captivating and filled with a dark beauty that is both frightening and attractive. While the fantastic world Ofelia enters is considerably different than her reality, it's by no means less haunting, as it's also a violent world with scary monsters that may reflect the harsh reality of the post-war Spain. With many themes borrowed from Spain's folklore, 'El Laberinto del Fauno' is very fresh and Del Toro's direction shows a maturity not seen before. One can only wonder what's next for the Mexican director as this film is easily his best film to date.The cast is simply excellent, starting with the young Ivana Baquero, who delivers a believable performance as Ofelia, carrying the film with power and making a very likable main character. However, the best performance comes from Sergi López, as the ruthless Captain Vidal. At first sight it may look as another typical villain, but López adds a lot of soul to a character that easily could had been a two-dimensional caricature in less talented hands. Maribel Verdú is also quite effective as Mercedes, a young woman who works as a servant and becomes Ofelia's only friend. She shows a lot of emotions in a character specially complex due to her role in the story. Doug Jones plays Pan, the Faun, delivering a very expressive performance under the heavy make-up he had to wear, making an interesting character even more mysterious than he already is. Finally, Álex Angulo and Ariadna Gil complete the cast with effective performances, although I found Gil a bit annoying. Angulo was simply excellent in a subtle low-key role. 'El Laberinto del Fauno' is a movie that easily could had been a predictable fantasy tale like the rest, but Del Toro constructs a movie that, while clearly follows and respects the fairytale pattern, it's never boring or tiresome, and in fact it keeps increasing its haunting beauty to the unforgettable last frame. Some have criticized the apparently biased way Del Toro presents the Spanish Civil War, but personally, I think that he makes sure to show that, no matter what side you are, in war the ones that lose the most are the children. While the movie is of course very violent, I think the 'R' rating is really unnecessary, as in the end, real fairy tales used to be that way too. In the end, 'El Laberinto del Fauno' is a very moving film, moving back and forth between the horror and fantasy realms with ease creating a dark world that may just be a reflection of our own violent reality. Beautifully haunting, 'El Laberinto del Fauno' is a movie that can't be missed. 10/10. A Masterpiece.",10,9,18,23 October 2006
Battleship Potemkin," Poetic!
","Very few people in the history of the cinema have left an imprint as deep as Sergei M. Eisenstein, Russian director and film theorist whose ideas about montage changed film editing (and film-making itself) forever. As one of the first to discover the potential of the artistic manipulation of film in order to transmit emotions, Eisenstein transformed film editing from simple chronological cuts to a more expressive language. His third movie, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin' ('Battleship Potemkin' in English), is definitely his most famous work and the flagship of the montage theory, as it was in this movie where he was able to fully explore the ideas he had developed initially in 'Stachka' ('Strike), his first feature. Many has been written about 'Battleship Potemkin', and not without a reason, as this movie lives up to its status of classic like no other.'Battleship Potemkin' is the dramatization of a real life story, the uprising of the Potemkin's crew against their officers in June 1905. The story begins when in the Potemkin, sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov) and his mates discover that the meat destined for their consumption is rotten and filled with maggots. The sailors protest, but the officers state that the meat is in fact in good conditions and that the sailors will have to eat it. These statements increase the rage of the sailors, who that night refuse to eat the rotten meat, defying their superiors in a blatant display of protest. The next day, the Potemkin's officers decide to execute those who defied their orders, and it's at that moment when sailor Vakulinchuk decides to call for a rebellion. The consequences of the Battleship Potemkin uprising will be enormous, and the first place that feels them is the small city of Odessa.While the movie was co-written by Eisenstein and three of his collaborators, 'Battleship Potemkin' is completely Eisenstein's brainchild, as he devised the movie as an experiment about the effects of his editing technique on the audience. The desired effect was that the audience felt completely identified with the revolutionaries and their cause, while at the same time had feelings of antipathy and rejection to the czar's army, arguably the film's 'villians'. While this may sound like a very simplistic approach to the story, it is really the perfect devise to Eisenstein's highly visual style of film-making, as what matters in the film are not the characters, but the events happening. Despite being a fictional account of the real life event, Eisenstein's script captures the spirit of the uprising and the ideologies behind it (after all, it was conceived as revolutionary propaganda) in a quite powerful way.Obviously, Eisenstein's direction is the true star of the movie, as he shows his mastery, not only of montage, but also of cinematography (by Eduard Tisse and Vladimir Popov) and overall visual composition, which give the movie a nearly poetic majesty. It is often said that movies with good narrative should be able to tell its story without sound, and 'Battleship Potemkin' proves that statement true with its near perfect visual storytelling that without problems (and with very few inter-titles) transmits its message to the audience. Another interesting trait of the film is how despite the manipulative montage, it feels incredibly realistic, almost as if it was a documentary on the subject. The now legendary Odessa Steps sequence, a monumental achievement in film-making, is done in a tremendously realistic fashion that, as critic Roger Ebert points out, 'is often referred to as if it really happened'.To achieve this atmosphere of realism, Eisenstein often used untrained people (and even members of his crew) to play basically themselves in his movies, and 'Potemkin' is not an exception, as to most of the actors on screen this meant their only participation in movies. A notable exception is the man playing the movie's most important role, Aleksandr Antonov, who plays rebel sailor Vakulinchuk. Antonov had his debut in Eisenstein's first movie Dnevnik Glumova, and went on to have a relatively prolific career during the following decades. As Vakulinchuk, his performance is quite powerful and very natural, capturing with ease the traits of the legendary rebel and transforming him into a myth. On a side note, directors Vladimir Barsky and Grigori Aleksandrov (Eisenstein's close collaborator) appear in the movie in the roles of the battleship's evil officers.More than 80 years after its initial release, one can still say that Eisenstein's experiment was an enormous improvement in film editing techniques, and more than that, it was probably the final step to complete the transformation of film into an art form. While the use of film editing to create emotions was of course done with the purpose of using the films as revolutionary propaganda, the use of images and symbolism to create emotions in the audience is hardly objectionable and one could say that it was even necessary for movie to be the expressive art form that is today. Due to all those reasons, 'Battleship Potemkin' is without a doubt one of the most important movies ever made, and one that even today manage to bring great emotions from its audiences, as its universal message of freedom is certainly more powerful than any political ideology.An obligatory entry in almost every book on the history of cinema, 'Battleship Potemkin' is a movie that even today, more than 80 years after its conception, keeps being not only a thrilling an entertaining story, but also as fresh and influential as when it was originally released. Some critics may accuse it of being manipulative propaganda, and while they are probably right, in the end, what film is not manipulative? 10/10",10,1,1,18 April 2007
The Grapes of Wrath," A masterpiece...
","During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, 'The Grapes of Wrath', a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.In 'The Grapes of Wrath', Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy (John Carradine), the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John (Frank Darien) looking for the Joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However, things won't be as easy as they thought they would.Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson, 'The Grapes of Wrath' takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, 'The Grapes of Wrath' avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed 'Stagecoach', 'Young Mr. Lincoln' and 'Drums Along the Mohawk' in less than 12 months. 'The Grapes of Wrath' would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, 'The Grapes of Wrath' was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's 'Young Mr. Lincoln', one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie: Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's 'The Grapes of Wrath' truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10/10",10,28,33,4 May 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," A nice surprise
","In 2003 a small book named 'The Devil Wears Prada' by the then unknown author Lauren Weisberger, came out of nowhere and surprisingly reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list becoming the proof that this new genre fiction named 'chick lit' was here to stay. However, more than its literary style, what made Weisberger's novel suddenly popular was the rumor that this fictional tale of an insanely capricious boss was based on the real life experience of its author while working in Vogue magazine under the rule of the editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour. Wheter Weisberger really based her book in Wintour is still open to debate (Weisberger denies it), but the book's huge popularity soon ensured a film adaptation, and the legendary actress Meryl Streep was the once chose to play the Devil dressed in Prada.The film is about young Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), who fresh from college, gets a job as personal assistant of Runway magazine editor, the legendary Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), famed for being a powerful influential figure in the fashion industry with little to no regard to those under her command. Andy, a complete foreigner to this environment, will have to put up with her eccentric boss and her insane capricious demands. To make things worse, as Andy begins to discover the industry she'll have to make choices, as her past life begins to feel incompatible with her new career.While the screenplay (by Aline Brosh McKenna) remains relatively close to the source novel, it's fair to point out that it has several (probably necessary) departures from the book's plot, making it a simplified version of the story. Still, the movie keeps the overall themes of the tyrannical boss and the choices of life, as well as the charm and freshness of Weisberger's book. However, due to this simplification of the plot, it becomes a bit predictable as it has a lot in common with many other similar films ('Swimming with Sharks', 1994, for example) about a young newcomer being bullied by a mean boss.'The Devil Wears Prada' is director David Frankel's first theatrical feature film, however, it's by no means his first important job, as Frankel perfected his craft directing several episodes of the famous TV series, 'Sex and the City' (also inspired by a 'chick lit' source). In many ways, 'The Devil Wears Prada' retains the feeling of Frankel's previous work and it's probably the obvious next step in his career. While it may not be the most original film ever, it has quite good features, such as a very good edition (by Mark Livolsi) and a well-selected soundtrack.Many words have been written about Meryl Streep's excellent performance, so I'll just say that she was perfect for the role, as she gives a deeper, more complex personality to a character that essentially exist to be mean. While Streep's performance is essentially what makes the film to stand out from other similar movies, credit must also go to Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt, who play Miranda's two main assistants. Hathaway as our main character, Andy, delivers a quiet, subtle performance that allows her character to be likable, specially as her actions begin to show the slow but constant effect that Miranda has in her. Emily Blunt is the film's best surprise, showing a great future and a big talent for comedy. Finally, Stanley Tucci has a minor role, but shows off his scene-stealing abilities and makes gold of every moment he appears on screen. The rest of the cast is quite effective, but nothing really as special as the four main characters.Personally, I think that the film's worst problem is the many similarities it shares with other films, as it gives the feeling that the story lacks originality. However, 'The Devil Wears Prada' makes up for this flaw with its light-hearted tone and its big charm, as it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously (as other similar films do). Also, Frankel's past directing a TV series becomes too notorious at times, making the film look like an extended chapter of a TV series; however, this is not really as annoying as it sounds, and it's probably due to the act that this is Frankel's first feature film.'The Devil Wears Prada' is quite a good film for a nice evening, it's charming, funny, and most importantly: entertaining. It's always a joy to watch a very talented actress at work, but it's also a joy to discover three new talents (Hathaway, Blunt and director David Frankel) having a chance and making a good job. It may not be a life-changing experience, but this devil is a nice surprise. 6/10",6,0,0,17 October 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," Excellent new take on a 70s classic!
","Right after the worldwide success of the excellent violent horror film 'Haute Tension', French director Alexandre Aja found himself under the spotlight as one of the new talents in the horror genre. Asked by director Wes Craven to rewrite his own 70s horror movie 'The Hills Have Eyes', Aja accepted to write the remake but as the project got bigger, Aja finally accepted to direct the film himself. The remake of Craven's violently gory tale of a dark ruthless side of America remained mostly faithful to the original, although Aja certainly did add his own touch and aimed for a subtler (but still appropriate) social cometary this time. This new version of the old 70s classic really plays its chances and does what every remake should do: try to actually improve the previous film. And surprisingly, it succeeds.As in the original, 'The Hills Have Eyes' is the tale of the Carters, an all-American family on a trip through the American southwest as they head to California for a nice Vacation together. While crossing the most difficult part of New Mexico's desert, their vehicle's tires blow and soon they find themselves stuck in the middle of the desert. Apparently without any way to get help, the family members' own personal differences begin to arise, but their familiar difficulties will be the least of their troubles as they discover that their accident was in fact a trap, a trap set by another all-American family, that just happens to be a bit twisted.Alexandre Aja and his regular collaborator Grégory Levasseur take Craven's original nightmarish plot about the violent meeting of two sides of America and flesh out the story giving some more details about the origin of the mutant family. As in his previous movie, 'Haute Tension', suspense and tension play a role as big as the violence and the gore, and the long scenes of introduction of the characters are a key factor in this: Aja and Levasseur create believable and overall likable characters, so realistic that it's really easy to be identified with them and be terrified by the horrors they have to endure. While the film may not offer something truly original, I found that the way it develops the characters is really what makes it so effective.As in his previous two films, Aja makes an excellent use of color and cinematography to create haunting atmospheres of isolation and hopelessness. The graphic violence displayed on the film is ruthless and without remorse (specially during the first attack), but what makes the film so powerful is the way Aja builds up the situation, making the actual violence seem even more disturbing than what's shown on screen. While the film still follows some of the conventions of modern horror (mainly the editing style), it somehow recaptures the spirit of the original's 'grindhouse' way of film-making.The acting in the film is remarkably realistic, as most of the cast does an excellent job, particularly Aaron Stanford and Vinessa Shaw, who are very effective. Stanford truly stole every of his scenes and ends up being an excellent lead actor. Ted Levine, Billy Drago, Tom Bower and Kathleen Quinlan are the experienced side of the cast, and without problem show their talent even when their roles are somewhat small (Sadly, Billy Drago's screen time is almost a cameo). Dan Byrd and Emilie De Ravin are the youngest and show a huge potential as their reactions to the horrors in the film are nothing short of believable.As far as remakes go, it's safe to count Aja's take on 'The Hills Have Eyes' as one of the best, not only in terms of being an excellent horror film, but also as a movie that shows respect for the original while adding some good new ideas (as well as better technology for the effects) to an already known plot. Probably my biggest complain would be that Aja's decision of taking the mutants out of the spotlight makes Craven's cometary too subtle to be noticed (they look less as a family, and more as a gang of monsters), however, I can understand his reasons, as the now enhanced mystery surrounding their actions truly adds to the suspense and tension that Aja was going for.'The Hills Have Eyes' may not be a turning point in cinema, or a very original film (it's still a remake after all), but it certainly delivers what one looks in a horror film of this kind: captivating plot, enough suspense, and horrifying violence. All in all, it may not become a classic, but it's good enough to give it a chance. Alexandre Aja is showing a lot of talent, and one wonders what he'll show us in the future. 8/10",7,0,33,13 November 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," A black comedy with a Little Big Heart
","The world of Independent film-making is definitely a tough one, as often the difficulties of getting a good budget or a good cast can become a difficult test to even the best directors. For that and many other reasons, it's always good to see a good independent films receiving the praise and recognition they deserve, proving that the support of a big studio is not necessary to make a product of high quality. 'Little Miss Sunshine' certainly has been luckier than most Indies in terms of budget and cast, but it still is a modest black comedy that takes advantage of its own limitations and relaying only in great acting and a lot of heart, makes more than the hundreds of comedies the big studios make in a year.The plot is the story of the Hoover family and their trip from New Mexico to California, in order to take their little daughter, Olvie (Abigail Breslin), to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. However, the Hoovers are not a very functional family, the father, Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a neurotic motivational speaker obsessed with winning, so immersed on his book that is barely in contact with his wife, Sheryl (Toni Collette), and always is arguing with his own father (Alan Arkin). Sheryl is no less neurotic than her husband, and her troubles increases as her brother Frank (Steve Carell), a literature professor, recently attempted to commit suicide and is now stuck at the Hoovers' place. Dwayne (Paul Dano), Sheryl's teenager son, is the mute (by his own choice) witness of this debacle, as he tries to live enough to get out of the house and make his dream come true: to be a jet fighter pilot. The road trip will prove to be a test not only to Olive, but for the rest of the family.'Little Miss Sunshine' is the very first work by writer Michael Arndt, and for the most part he makes an amazing job in setting up what's basically a character driven road movie. Arndt's script may not be very original (and that's probably the film's biggest problem), but he uses the conventions of his genre in a very clever way, mainly by focusing on his different characters and letting them and their own personal stories to carry the main plot. This approach to the character development makes it so realistic that one can't help but feel identified with at least one of the Hoovers. Sure, it's an overtly exaggerated portrait of that dysfunctional yet lovable family we all have, but this delicious black comedy it's done with such charm and heart that it actually works, and even makes the story feel fresh despite not having a really original plot.This movie not only marks Arndt's debut as a writer, it's also the first feature film by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, a team of music directors famed for their work with rock bands across the 90s. It's kind of surprising that, unlike most former music video directors, their transition to film comes with a really subtle film that focuses on the plot and the characters instead of the visuals. However, this doesn't mean that visually the film is unpleasing, on the contrary, it features an excellent cinematography (Tim Suhrstedt) coupled with a subtle score by Mychael Danna and Devotchka that work perfectly to set the tone and mood of Arndt's little story. The subtle approach taken by the Dayton-Faris tandem succeeds in giving life to this charming story by letting the actors to completely own their characters and be the most important part of the film.'Little Miss Sunshine''s magic would not be possible without one of the best assembled cast in years. The entire group of actors that play the Hoover family really show big chemistry together and deliver a believable portrait of this dysfunctional family. Starting with Greg Kinnear, who makes the best of a character that easily could had been a two-dimensional cartoon. Toni Collette really shines in her role, and is one of the film's best surprises. The experienced Alan Arkin tackles with dignity and funny enthusiasm on the role of the grandfather, delivering another of his excellent performances. Steve Carell proves that he is more than a mere comedian in a complicated, yet essential role for the film. Abigail Breslin is literally the film's heart, bringing her spark to the film in a wonderful performance. Comparatively, Paul Dano comes up as the weakest link, but that has more to do with the high quality of his cast-mates, as his work is still effective and worth of praise on its own.Many have criticized the way 'Little Miss Sunshine' remains too close to the road movie formula and its use of overused clichés, however I find that to be unfairly harsh, as well as misdirected, as it's not really the plot what matters in the end, it's how the characters react to the situations that this trip presents them. Exaggerated or not, the characterizations are really believable, and that's the element that makes the film to stand out among other similar films. The characters here do have a soul, and as the family gather the necessary strength to push the old VW van, they gather the courage to overcome their inner personal demons. While probably predictable, few movies of this optimistic feel good style could carry its plot keeping the same energy from beginning to end.'Little Miss Sunshine' is the little big surprise of 2006, a black comedy that attempted to do a lot with very little, and that for the most part succeeded in its attempt. The young talent here shows a lot of promise, and hopefully will keep delivering works as good as this one in the future. 'Little Miss Sunshine' may not be the most original film of the world, but this little jewel can easily be considered among the best of the year. 8/10",9,23,32,20 December 2006
North by Northwest," Pure first class entertainment!
","Together with 'Psycho' and 'The Birds', 'North by Northwest' is among Hitchcock's most famous and praised films. It has been said that this movie marks the beginning of the action/thriller as we know it today, and not without reason as this film takes Hitchcock's favorite plot (ordinary man in unbelievable adventures) to the extreme in an epic adventure across U.S.Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an ordinary man who is mistaken for a spy and suddenly gets involved in a series of intrigues and adventures that will take him from Washington to Mount Rushmore as he tries to put an end to his problem. James Mason plays Phillip Vandamm, the international criminal who believes that Thornhill works for the U.S. government and desperately wants to kill him. Eve Marie Saint is Eve, a mysterious woman who helps Roger but has a secret agenda of her own.It is obvious that Hitchcock wanted to pleasure his audience after the mixed reviews he received in 'Vertigo', as he gives thrill after thrill in this roller-coaster but always with class and elegance. Thornhill goes from one peril to another and the suspense is always on the rise. Also, his dark humor returns and Cary Grant definitely is the best man to deliver it.Cary Grant is perfect as Roger Thornhill, and it is probably the role of his lifetime. It is very well known the fact that James Stewart was the first choice but was rejected after the failure of 'Vertigo'. Even when personally I consider Stewart a better actor, Cary Grant was the perfect actor for the lighter Hitchcock; with his suave persona, good humor and classy elegance, Grant shines here as well as in 'suspicion' and 'To Catch a Thief'. On the other hand, Stewart was more apt for the darker side of Hitchcock in films like 'Rope', 'Rear Window', and the masterpiece 'Vertigo'.Eve Marie Saint joins the ranks of the icy blonds in the Master's films, as the beautiful and mysterious Eve. There was clearly good chemistry between her and Grant, and the sexual innuendo is brilliant. One can really believe that they are a couple of lovers in the middle of the international intrigue. Martin Landau and James Mason complete the cast as the villains and they surely give brilliant performances. The young Landau was set for a bright future and he demonstrates it in this early role.Many things can be said about 'North by Northwest', but one thing is true; while this movie is basically a series of scenes of danger and adventure, Hitchcock's masterful touch separates it from the rest and puts it in a superior place. His perfect camera-work and the score by the always effective Bernard Herrmann created immortal scenes. Sure, 'Vertigo' is a superior movie, but it is easy to see why this one succeeded where 'Vertigo' failed: 'North by Northwest' was designed to please the audience.Honestly, 'North By Northwest' is not a perfect movie, it has its flaws and it is definitely not Hitchcock's best film. However, it has a lot of something special that can only be classified as 'magic' that one can't help but enjoy the 136 minutes of thrills and adventure that the Master of Suspense prepared for us. 9/10",9,2,3,18 April 2006
Over the Hedge," Surpassing all the expectations...
","Like most people, I was convinced that Pixar's 'Cars' was going to be the animated movie of the year and that 'Over the Hedge' was just another cheap attempt with the proved formula of cute talking animals. I was very surprised by the end result as it ended up not only being an enjoyable fable about friendship and the typical stuff, it is also a very witty commentary about our modern way of life.Based on the syndicated comic strip written and drawn by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, 'Over the Hedge' is the story of R.J. (Bruce Willis), a witty and knowledgeable raccoon with a problem: he must restore the food he stole from a bear in two weeks or he will have to be eaten in its place. To do it, he decides to raid the houses of the new suburban landscape, and to do it he recruits a group of naive animals who never had seen a human before. almost without knowing it he'll become a member of the family and will begin to have serious doubts about his plan of deceiving the gang.Directed by Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick, 'Over the Hedge' is a huge step forward from Dreamworks' previous animated feature, 'Madagascar'. Technically the movie looks beautiful and the animation is for the most part superb. Great care was taken with the characters' design and while they look quite different from their original versions, the change was definitely for the better.The plot at its core is once again the typical story of an outcast who finds a family, but it's spiced up by the satire and wit of the original comic strip and that's what makes the movie different from others. This balance between the comic strip's sharp social commentary and the funny and simpler slapstick comedy makes that the film can be enjoyed by both children and adults without being overtly filled with pop-culture references. The characters are very well written although due to the large number of them some may feel a bit underdeveloped.The voice cast is appropriate, although like in most Dreamworks movies, movie stars are preferred over professional voice actors creating a bit of a mixed bag. Bruce Willis is good, although nothing spectacular, and Garry Shandling as Verne, the gang leader, was also not as surprising. On the other hand, Steve Carell makes a brilliant job, as well as Wanda Sykes and a surprising Avril Lavigne. Wanda Sykes, William Shatner and Thomas Hayden Church are also brilliant.Frankly, the movie's biggest flaw was the large amount of characters it has. While everyone has their moment to shine (and in most cases is very well used), at the end one has the feeling that either the movie was too short or that there was one or two characters too many. The movie's plot also may be predictable to most people, however, the way the director handles the movie truly makes up for the unoriginal storyline. Tim Johnson proves his talent once again and demonstrates why he is a very underrated director.To summarize, I was very surprised by the way 'Over the Hedge' developed and I truly enjoyed it. It's great assemble of characters and the witty script makes up for its defects and the final product is a very good one. While it probably be overshadowed by the more popular 'Cars', this sleeper hit definitely deserves a watch. 7.5/10",7,10,10,12 July 2006
Edward Scissorhands," Beautiful Masterpiece!
","Tim Burton was a rising star in film-making when in 1988 he released his successful mix of dark comedy and horror 'Beetlejuice'. This success took him to direct the ambitious adaptation of 'Batman' in 1989 and gave him enough freedom to develop his own personal projects. The first of them was this little film. 'Edward Scissorhands', a charming fable about a misunderstood young man, is probably the first film where Burton expresses his personal views on the world and at the same time, expands his vivid visual style to new heights.The story begins with Peg (Dianne Wiest), an Avon door-to-door seller who discovers Edward (Johnny Depp) living lonely in the haunting mansion that rises above the little suburban town where she lives. Surprised at the fact that Edward seems to have scissors instead of hands, she takes him home in order to help him to adapt to the community. While at first he is accepted, he'll discover that human relations are more complex than he imagined; and things will complicate even more when he falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder).Burton creates a modern fairy tale that is not only visually impressive, but also very entertaining and most of all, very meaningful. Edward is a man who is just experiencing life, but due to his handicap he can't fully fit in Peg's apparently perfect world. His love for Kim also creates problems when Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) makes Edward's life even harder. Edward is an outcast whose inability to touch gets in conflict with his desire to love, while at the same time faces the suburban community which seems more frightening than the haunting Gothic castle where he was living before.Johnny Depp changed his image of teenage heartthrob and with this film he began to show his great potential and superb talent to literally become one with his character. He portrays the emotions of the confused Edward with feeling and power, and gives life to Edward's mix of fragility and naiveté. Winona Ryder also was a rising star at that moment, and while her character is nowhere as complex as Depp's, she plays the role of Kim with dignity and grace. In this movie she displays the talent that would convert her into one of the most promising young actresses of her generation.Burton imagination has no limits and his eye for visuals excels in 'Edward Scissorhands'. His care for detail creates haunting images and beautiful compositions; from the haunting castle where Edward lives, to the grass sculpture that he creates, everything fits in this bizarre fairy tale and complete the perfection of this movie.It is hard to find a flaw in the film, as it is probably the first masterpiece that Tim Burton would create in his career. While of course it has some logical plot holes, as a whole the film is one of the best movies ever done in history, as it successfully mixes fantasy, drama and romance with a small dose of Burton's black humor. Depp and Burton would continue working together in many films, including Burton's masterpiece 'Ed Wood'.With the exception of 'Ed Wood', Tim Burton has never been this good. 'Edward Scissorhands' definitely has earned its classic status on its own right, as it is one of those movies that touch the deep parts of the soul with its inventive originality and almost-magical charm. 'Edward Scissorhands' is simply unforgettable. 10/10",10,1,1,26 April 2006
Van Helsing," An awful and pointless although entertaining movie
","Director Stephen Sommers surprised the world in 1999 with a very fresh take on Universal Studio's classic 'The Mummy', giving it new life while transforming it from Gothic horror to action-adventure in 'Indiana Jones'' vein.Now, and after an almost-as-good sequel, he tries it again, this time with the other classic monster from Universal's horror movies: Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. Sadly, this time Sommers does a terribly bad job with the script and what could had been his masterpiece ended in one of the most awful movies of 2004: 'Van Helsing'.Using the name and the mystique of the famous vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel 'Dracula', Sommers links the three monsters by turning the old scientist into some kind of Vatican's 007 complete with fantastic artifacts and macho attitude.The idea, at its very core, is very good, after all, who better than Van Helsing to fight the classic monsters of Universal's golden age of horror? Too bad that the idea was developed with bad results.Hugh Jackman stars as Gabriel Van Helsing, an agent of the Vatican whose job is to kill monsters. He is sent to Transilvania to save a gypsy family who has been fighting vampire king Dracula for centuries; their problem: if the family line extinguishes before Dracula's death, the entire clan will go to hell. To make things worse, there are only two survivors: Anna and Velkan Valerious(played by Kate Beckinsale and Will Kemp respectively).The script is weak. That is the main problem here, since it's full of plot holes that the audience may end up wondering what the hell is the point of the movie. While Sommers tries to put mysteries to keep the audience thrilled, the story goes on circles and never fully develops the potential of the many subplots thrown in there.To make things worse, the acting is terribly bad in most cases. While Jackman and David Wenham(as Van Helsing's sidekick) do their best with the bad script, the rest of the cast goes over-the-top in scenes that are so unintentionally funny that one ends up wondering if this is not a farcical comedy(like the brilliant 'Young Frankenstein') instead of Sommers' recent action blockbuster.Sommers direction still is solid, and the action scenes will keep you on the edge of the seat. The SFX for the most part are very well done and the beautiful locations worth the ticket. It's a shame that the script and the acting ruins what could have been a very good movie.3/10",4,0,1,6 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Outstanding!
","Praised by many, hated by many, the third part of this well known fantasy saga is probably the most controversial of all. Nevertheless, and trying to be the most objective about it, this is probably the best movie in the series, and one of the best movies of 2004.Most of the complains have been directed towards the director, Mexican Alfonso Cuarón, who has received many awards for his work in 'A Little Princess', 'Great Expectations' and 'Y Tu Mamá También'. I find most of those complains a little bit too childish, considering that their main topic is how much it was taken from the book. Not only this complain should is directed to the wrong person(whether true or false, it's the writer of the screenplay's fault), but it's very simplistic to say that the book should be completely transcript to the movie.Regarding this aspect(and counting myself as a fan of the book), I found the adaptation(key word: Adaption) very good, and while it was not the most faithful to the book(unlike parts 1 & 2), probably this liberties helped the movie to be more entertaining, and gave it a more dynamic pace. In my opinion, all the changes to the book served to a bigger purpose: to make the movie enjoyable. Of Course, as a fan of the books I was shocked at first, but considering the length of the book and how good the final product is, I think they did a pretty good job with the adaptation.Cuarón's direction is fresh, and shows a development over previous parts, considering that our characters have grown up. The world looks now darker as the plot moves to somber situations. The plot is as follows: As the mysterious Prisoner Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban in what seems to be a hunt for Harry Potter, the young wizard, now 13 years old, returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year of study. Meanwhile, the Dementors, the horrifying guards of Azkaban, patrol the surroundings of Hogwarts looking for Black and make the year uncomfortable not only for Harry, but for the entire school. Sirius Black carries part of Harry's past and a shocking discovery will take place when they face each other.The acting for the most part is superb with the young actors gaining more experience every year. Emma Watson displays an enormous improvement and shows promise of a bright future. Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, has less chances of displaying his abilities but nevertheless he manages to perform a good acting. Daniel Radcliffe is not so lucky, but considering that the weight of the entire series rest on his shoulders, it's good to see him improve in this movie. Maybe he is not the best actor in the movie, but he has known the part and has made it his own.The adult cast is awesome, and even when the kids are the stars, there are fine performances by veterans of the Harry Potter series Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane as well as newcomers Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Michael Gambon. David Thewlis steals the movie as the gentle but cursed prof. Lupin. He manages to capture the sadness of the character and the kindness he displays to his students.Overall, this is probably the best Harry Potter movie to date. Sure, it's not as faithful to the source as the others, but the changes help it to be enjoyable for both Harry Pottewr fans and the casual movie-goer.9/10. Outstanding",8,0,2,21 November 2005
28 Days Later...," Horror movies the way they used to be...
","When most people think of horror movies they immediately think of pointless nudity, gallons of blood and tons of gore; and while that image may be close to reality, the horror genre offers the chance of delivering something else, something intelligent, something deep. Of course, not every director/writer takes that chance, but when they do, it is big. Director Danny Boyle adds a bit of blood to his effective formula of existentialist character studies in '28 Days Later...', a powerful ans smart apocalyptic horror movie in the old style of 'Last Man on Earth' or Romero's 'Dead' trilogy.One morning a young British man named Jim awakes from a coma and finds nobody around. He doesn't know it but 28 days before a lethal virus codenamed 'Rage' was unleashed by accident leading to thousands of deaths and the evacuation of London and other major cities. Now Jim, along with a handful of other survivors must find a safe place and a way to find other survivors of the epidemic before being killed by the hundreds of still living infected people.'28 Days Later...' is a horror film the way the genre used to be, it is not only an entertaining and scary movie, it is a through-provoking one. Written by Alex Garland, the film offers a surprisingly realist and very insightful take on humanity and survival, as well as providing an interesting social commentary on the easy corruption of the authority. Sure, it may not be the most original movie in the world, but the execution of the whole idea is near perfect. Director Danny Boyle builds up his story at the right pace and lets the story unfold smoothly.The realistic visuals used in the film gives the movie a semi-documentary look that gives the film a frightening realism. As usual, Boyle's focus is in the characters rather than in the plot and this approach is just what makes this horror movie so different than other examples of modern horror. He makes us know, like and eventually care for this characters in a very reminiscent way to what George Romero did in 'Night of the Living Dead' and its sequels. This is no coincidence as Danny Boyle doesn't hide his influences; the film pays true tribute to well-known classics of the genre without being derivative or pretentious.Cillian Murphy is simply superb as the lead character, but credit must also go to Naomi Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns, who play the other survivors Jim finds. Naomie Harris gives a terrific performance as a woman who will do whatever is necessary to survive, and Gleeson and Burns are very effective and their father-daughter relationship is very believable. Murphy has earned praise for his performance but it is safe to say that without this good supporting cast the movie wouldn't be the same.If a flaw was to be found in '28 Days Later...' it would be that probably the film may not everyone's cup of tea. Fans of horror will be really pleased but the casual movie goer may be turned off by the grim depressing tone of the film and its ruthless violence. Other than that the film is near perfect and while not the most original horror film, it is one of the best executed examples of the so-called 'zombie sub-genre'.With its well-rounded characters, its witty plot and its remarkable visual style, this modern horror film proves that it deserves all the hype surrounding it. While only time will prove if the film becomes a classic or not, it is definitely one of the best horror movies of the decade. 9/10",9,1,2,21 June 2006
Cars," Not a classic, but I still like it...
","when Pixar announced their idea for 'Cars' (a world exactly like our own but inhabited by living cars instead of humans), I thought that the film was going to be an instant failure. Then, as the images of the new graphics and the plot outlines started to came out I was still unimpressed by them, seeing at how unoriginal the plot was and how everything seemed to be aiming for showing off their technical progress, my hopes for 'Cars' were really low. I guess that's why I ended up liking it so much.'Cars' is the story of a cocky, arrogant and very ambitious young racer named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who has become the new sensation in the racing circuit. During the trip towards the final race of the circuit (a race that would give him the Cup if he wins), he gets lost and accidentally ends up in a small forgotten town on Route 66 named 'Radiator Springs'. Without knowing how to return to the Highway and forced to repair the damage caused by his arrival, McQueen will discover the simple way of life of this quiet town and its inhabitants.Visually, the film is perfect; the computer animation has reached a point where it seems that the only limit is to create a human being, and I bet that Pixar is not too far from it. Light effects, water effects, reflection, chrome and other phenomena are represented with great detail surpassing everything Pixar had done before. However, this tale of a young and ambitious car living in the fast urban world and his clash with the simple and slower life of rural U.S. is nothing really new or original, and this is where the directors/writers John Lasseter and the late Joe Ranft make a difference.'Cars' is a new version of a familiar old story. Sure, it is by no means an original story and it is very predictable, but the details added by the writers are what makes the film different. The lovable and different characters give soul to the apparently lifeless 'Cars', and they make the difference in what otherwise would be a dull boring and predictable film. every character has been carefully detailed, not only visually, but also in their personalities, antics and voices. This care in the characterization department is what made 'Toy Story' or Fox's 'Ice Age' different among other animated films.The voice actors are very good, and it is noticeable the care taken in assembling the cast. Owen Wilson makes a very good McQueen, making him an arrogant, ambitious city boy; Paul Newman brings his experience and makes a wonderful Doc Hudson, Radiator Springs' mayor. Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable guy complete the cast and all of them are equally competent in their jobs. Their performances give the final touch to the film.As written above, the film has only one big detail that may turn off some viewers. Its plot is nothing really new or unseen, and it could be said that it is one of their least funny scripts. Sure, it touches an important subject, but a few more laughs could had helped the final product. However, credit must go to the writers, who have crafted a movie that will keep the kids interested even when it is not a laugh riot.'Cars' may not be have a multi-awarded script or even an original plot, but it has a lot of heart, and it shows how much Lasseter and Ranft cared for the story. Despite its troubles, it is a fine film to take the children. If you keep the expectations low and relax a bit it will be a nice ride.",6,11,18,8 July 2006
Ghost Rider," Cheesy but fun...
","Ever since the release of Bryan Singer's 'X-Men', movie based on Marvel Comics' popular superhero team, the first decade of the 2000s saw a revival of films based on the adventures of comic book heroes even bigger to what Donner's 'Superman' did in the late 70s, and Burton's 'Batman' in the late 80s. After 'X-Men' came 'Spider-Man', 'The Hulk' and many other classic names of the main comic book pantheons (even the Batman franchise got a reboot) as modern technology made possible what in the past years was impossible: to represent the fantastic abilities of the characters in a somewhat realistic way. After more than 6 six years of troubled development (it was one of the first to be announced), the supernatural hero created in the 70s by Gary Friedrich and Mike Ploog, 'Ghost Rider', has now joined the ranks of superheroes with a movie adaptation.The movie is the story of Johnny Blaze (Matt Long), the son of a stunt motorcycle rider (Brett Cullen) who one day discovers that his father is dying of cancer. On that day the demon Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) appears to him, and offers Johnny the chance to save his father if he is willing to give him his soul. Blaze sings the contract and his father gets cured, but later gets killed on a motorcycle accident, making Johnny's soul the Devil's property, and he'll find a use for him someday. Many years later, Johnny (Nicolas Cage) is now a famous stunt driver, and is in this way where he gets reunited to the girlfriend he abandoned as a teenager, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). However, the Devil also returns to Johnny's life and forces him to become his warrior, the Ghost Rider, as he needs him to kill his son Blackheart (Wes Bentley), who plans to overpower him.Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (who previously worked on 'Daredevil'), 'Ghost Rider' is essentially, a movie to spent the time and have some fun. This is not a movie that explores the complexities of its hero, but one that seems to celebrate the fun and entertainment that comic book superheroes represent. Unlike what one would expect of a title like 'Ghost Rider' (and its themes of demons and ghosts), Johnson makes a story that owes more to adventure comic books and the Western serials of old than to the Faust myth, as he adds a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humor that lightens up things a lot. Johnson truly captures the feeling of a comic book in his story, but sadly it also carries the problems that this kind of stories have, like for example a very shallow characterization, several underdeveloped subplots, and a predictable and clichéd plot.Now, while Johnson's work as a writer is average at best, he fares a tad better as a director, as he manages to bring to life his comic book adventure with all the wry humor and action he put on paper. As written above, Johnson's movie owes a lot to Western serials and pulp fiction, and this carries out to the visual style too, as even it makes a big nod to the Phantom Rider, the classic Western character that originated 'Ghost Rider'. Since the main character is literally a living skull on fire, the special effects had to be excellent, and fortunately, they are the best part of the film, as their creation of the rider and his fire is simply outstanding. Sadly, a movie can't be completely about special effects, and to his great misfortune, Johnson's skill as a director of real life actors are considerably inferior to his skill at making great visuals.Nicolas Cage is surprisingly effective as Johnny Blaze (an improvement over his disastrous performance in the remake of 'The Wicker Man'), and against all odds makes a convincing tortured antihero with a very black humor. Peter Fonda and Donal Logue are also pretty good in their small roles, although the real highlight of the film is Sam Elliott, who plays the mysterious Caretaker of the local cemetery. They all make great jobs in their arguably underwritten characters, but sadly, the film is also plagued by awful performances, starting with the one given by Eva Mendes, whom at best feels severely out of place, and at worst looks like an amateur trying to act. Definitely not her best moment. The other cast member who brings the movie down is sadly Wes Bentley, who not only isn't remotely memorable as the main villain, but also overacts to the point of ridicule.While certainly the bad performance of some cast members hurt the film a lot, it must be said that there really wasn't a lot for them to work with, because as written above, the writing isn't exactly the best material and no matter how good one actor is, the quality of the script will play a major role in the final output. This is specially obvious in the way Johnson fleshed out his villains, as if some characters are insipid, the villains here are dull, uninspired and serve no other purpose that to let the hero show off how amazing he is. A good villain has a definite personality and in 'Ghost Rider' they only exist to look good, and that's a real damage to the movie, as there's never a real sense of danger with such weak counterparts for the hero. The complete opposite are Fonda and Elliott's characters, whom are easily the best thing about the film.Despite all its flaws, I enjoyed 'Ghost Rider' for what it was: an action movie with a touch of the Western genre meant to translate the fun and entertainment of comic book adventures to film. I probably liked it more that I should have, but that's mainly because while it certainly lacks a lot of quality, it had a lot of heart, and sometimes that's all that matters. Not a particularly good movie, but it is a good ride. 6/10",6,4,6,12 November 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," The result of Rushed project...
","'X-Men: The Last Stand', chapter three of the film adventures of Marvel Comic's most popular superhero team has finally arrived after a long chain of pre-production problems and repeated changes in the crew. Sadly, all this problems are reflected in the final product and it is safe to say that the studio's insistence on making the film on time to compete with 'Superman Returns' no matter the cost is directly responsible of the mediocre results of the film.The movie starts off with a 'cure' for the mutations being discovered, giving the mutants a chance to abandon their powers and become 'normal'; this discovery is taken by the powerful mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen) as a threat and decides to eliminate it causing a confrontation with Prof. Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) X-Men. In the middle of the confrontation a tremendous source of power appears that seems to be linked to the deceased Jean Grey (Famke Janssen).Brett Ratner takes on the spot left by previous director Bryan Singer and attempts to continue exploring the universe Singer and his writers developed in this adaptation of the comic book. While writers Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg construct an intriguing plot that continues the story arc set by the previous movie, they fail to develop believably the characters and in an obvious attempt to include as many new mutants as possible, they forget to give them a purpose to be there.The visual style follows the same realistic sci-fi vibe that Singer created for the previous movies, keeping a continuity in design that is very effective. However, Ratner's movie feels too short, or more exactly, too fast; as its non-stop pace makes one wish they had not rushed the project because the amount of continuity errors and overall the film's poor edition are fatal flaws that terribly affect the movie. The epic-scale tale penned by Penn and Kinberg is left as another typical and predictable 'good VS evil' fight with terrible plot twists and bad characterization.The acting is average at best, with Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart being (as usual) the best in their roles. Jackman's Wolverine, who is probably the only character who receives attention from the writers, is still very good, although his lack of chemistry with Janssen is apparent. the rest of the cast is as dull as usual, and not because the actors are bad, it is just that their talents are wasted in pointless roles. Complex characters such as Rogue (Anna Paquin), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) or the newly introduced Beast (a superb Kelsey Grammar) are reduced to shadows of their former selves.The special effects range from outstanding to cheap looking, and this big variation in quality makes one suspect that Ratner had not enough resources to work with. This is could be called the trademark of this film: there are things that are simply outstanding while others are very, very disappointing; leaving an overall mediocre result and definitely not a worthy follow up to what Singer had accomplished in the previous two movies.Director Singer and his writers build up a universe where the audience not familiar with the characters could enjoy a coherent and entertaining story; in contrast, Ratner's attempt to continue Bryan Singer's labor in the X-Men saga ends up as an inconsistent and weak episode in the series, and surely will disappoint not only fans of the comic book, but also fans of the first two movie episodes.",4,0,1,9 June 2006
Stardust," An excellent tale of romance and fantasy...
","In the late 80s, a new generation of writers changed the American comic book industry forever with the complex mature-themed nature of their stories, effectively transforming what was considered an unsophisticated literary genre into a well respected art form. Among that group of storytellers was Neil Gaiman, a young British writer who decided to try his luck at comic books convinced by his friend, Alan Moore (writer of the classic graphic novel 'Watchmen'). After landing a job at DC comics, Gaiman started the series that would make him famous, 'The Sandman', the comic book where his taste for fantasy and great imagination found no limits. Years later Gaiman returned to prose, and so he decided to make a fantasy novel in the style of classic English fantasy, the one that used to be done before the days of Tolkien and Lewis' high fantasy. And the result was 'Stardust'.'Stardust' is the story of Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox), a humble young man hopelessly in love with the most beautiful girl in his town, Victoria (Sienna Miller). To his misfortune, she has accepted a marriage proposal by Humphrey (Henry Cavill), so he decides to give her an ultimate proof of his love: a star has fallen from the sky, so he tells Victoria that he'll bring it to her, even if that means to cross the legendary wall that separates their town from the mysterious forest. What Tristan doesn't know, is that the wall exists to separate his world from the magical realm of Stormhold, and that he is not the only one looking for the star, as a powerful witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) wants it to be young again, and two princes (Mark Strong and Jason Flemyng) need it to claim the throne of Stormhold. However, the biggest surprise will be the star's identity.Screenwriter Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn make a nice adaptation of Gaiman's novel that keeps the story's core points, although they toned down the darkness of the novel quite a bit. This is not really a bad thing, as in the process, Goldman and Vaughn remained faithful to the novel's spirit and the result is a movie that joyfully plays with witty comedy, fantasy and romance, and yet it's still completely in tone with the fantasy stories that inspired Gaiman's book. In essence, 'Stardust' is what could be called 'a fairy tale for grown-ups', as it's fantasy is whimsical, clever and very imaginative, but with a greater emphasis on the characters and their development than in any epic scale adventure. And this is where 'Stardust' has its strongest point: the character development is remarkably well done, and even those characters with very short screen time are unforgettable.While 'Stardust' is a very different (and more ambitious) film to his previous movie, 2004's 'Layer Cake', director Matthew Vaughn manages to make it work by concentrating in the story and letting everything else grow from there. Since comedy and romance are now the main ingredients of the film, Vaughn focuses the film on his characters, specially in the relationship the main couple. Still, while 'Stardust' lacks the epic scope of high fantasy films, Vaughn manages to make his story a very beautiful looking one, giving life to the kingdom of Stormhold with a beautiful Victorian style and good care for details. Sadly, a fantasy film like 'Stardust' fantasy films tends to relay a lot on special effects, and budgetary reasons prevented Vaughn from making truly stunning visuals, however, the ones that appear are good enough to make Stormhold come to life.As written above, 'Stardust' is a fantasy movie where the characters have more importance than the story, so a good cast is needed to make it work. Well, the movie is benefited by a great supporting cast that includes Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, a truly unforgettable Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer in what is definitely her great return to mainstream movies. Sadly, the main couple, Charlie Cox and Claire Danes, get easily overshadowed by the supporting cast's performances, specially Cox, whom despite having great natural charm still feels a bit weak in the lead role. Danes fares a bit better, as there are scenes that truly allow her to shine in her character. By the way, I must say that while his role is kind of limited, Mark Strong is excellent as prince Septimus, and delivers some of the best swashbuckling scenes of the last times.Being an accomplished mix of fantasy, romance and comedy in the classic style of fairy tales, 'Stardust''s worst enemy may be it's very consciously attempt to pay homage to that kind of fantasy tales. In a time where adaptations of high fantasy books like 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'The Chronicles of Narnia' are popular, it would be easy to expect 'Stardust' to follow that pattern, but it doesn't and it may turn off people expecting epic battles instead of romantic swashbuckling. If there's a recent movie that bears any similitude to this film, that one would be 'The Princess Bride' (also based on a novel), although Reiner's film is certainly grounded even more on the comedy genre. There are details in the lead actors' performances, and the already mentioned troubles in some visual effects, but these are minor quibbles that don't really hurt the film.While not exactly a masterpiece of the genre, 'Stardust' is still one of the best fantasy films of the last years, and most definitely a worthy adaptation of Gaiman's novel. Whimsical and lighthearted but also witty and clever at the same time, 'Stardust' proves that not every fantasy film must be about saving the world from an evil dark lord, and that romantic comedies must not be unnecessarily sappy affairs. This excellent tale of fantasy and romance is great for fans of both genres. Comparisons to 'The Princess Bride' can't be avoided, but this film is almost as good as that fantasy classic.8/10",8,1,1,6 December 2007
The Elephant Man," Terrific masterpiece!
","Joseph Merrick, the man once known as 'The Elephant Man' due to his terrible deformities, is definitely one of the icons of the Victorian age, as his sad story is an example of how terrible can we be with people with physical differences. Right after his surrealist debut with the 'Eraserhead', David Lynch was asked by producer Mel Brooks to direct a film based on the life of Joseph Merrick as written by Merrick's doctor, Sir Frederick Treves. Brooks was so amazed by Lynch's debut that he wanted that bizarre and unique sensibility to tell the story of the bizarre and unique life of Joseph Merrick, 'The Elephant Man'.The movie follows Merrick's (played by John Hurt) life in a relatively faithful way, from the time that Sir Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) finds him working in a Victorian freak show. After he takes him to the hospital, Treves will discover that behind 'The Elephant Man', there is a human being that deserves to live with the same dignity as any other man. Merrick's efforts for having a normal life, his struggle to adapt to society and Treves' doubts on his intentions are the core story of Lynch's film.Director David Lynch is probably more known for his surrealist works, so 'The Elephant Man''s harsh realism may come as something unexpected to people more familiar with his later work. Still, the movie contains small but noticeable elements of what would become the director's trademarks, such as the nightmarish surrealism and the dreamlike atmosphere. The film's beautiful black and white cinematography gives the movie a look reminiscent of the early silent films that perfectly sets the stage for the events presented on film.The story unfolds with good rhythm and pacing, it is surprisingly accurate to the real story (albeit it does have some alterations) and while many have labeled it as emotionally manipulative, it is hard to think of a different way to present this story. The script focuses on Merrick's life under the care of Sir Treves, and the friendship that grew between them. It is a very moving and powerful story and the way it is adapted to the big screen is remarkable.While Lynch and his team deserve credit for the success of this film, the cast is what definitely makes the film a masterpiece. John Hurt makes an inspired performance as Merrick and portrays the emotion and passion of this man who ironically, was unable to express emotions in his face. It is definitely one of the best performances of that decade. Anthony Hopkins as Sir Frederick Treves is, as usual, very effective in his role and gives proper balance to Merrick's part. John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft complete the cast and are equally superb in their small roles.The film is completely flawless and even people usually turned off by Lynch's bizarre film-making style will probably enjoy this atypical work from the American director. What in other hands may had ended up as a blatant exercise in emotional manipulation, here is a subtle yet very powerful and moving portrait of a man who had a tragic life, and that despite of this, he still could find something to hang on.Merrick was a prisoner in his own flesh, and the people that could saw past his appearance discovered a brilliant young man with ideas, dreams and ambitions like any other normal man. Lynch has captured this real life example of courage and turned it into a masterpiece of cinema. 10/10",10,1,1,3 July 2006
Shrek the Third," Nowhere near the first two, but still a good film...
","In the year of 2001, the relatively young studio DreamWorks released the animated film 'Shrek', the movie that would finally consolidate them as a major player in the field of computer animation and as the main competition for Walt Disney Pictures. Loosely based on William Steig's 1990 children's book of the same name, 'Shrek' was a highly original reworking of traditional fairy tales that took everyone by surprise with its fresh humor and extremely likable characters. Giving a twist to the classic concept of a princess locked in a tower by a dragon, 'Shrek' had a grumpy ogre instead of handsome knight, a talkative donkey instead of dashing stallion, and a very down-to-earth princess with a dark secret. Obviously, the film's success prompted DreamWorks to make sequels, with part 2 appearing in 2004, and in 2007, 'Shrek the Third'.In 'Shrek the Third', we find Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wife, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), living at the castle of Far Far Away as Fiona's father, King Harold (John Cleese) has fallen ill and Shrek must take his place. While not really happy about it, Shrek accepts hoping to return to his swamp as soon as the King recovers is health, but sadly, King Harold dies, leaving the grumpy ogre as heir to the throne. Not happy with the idea of ruling a country, Shrek decides to find the other heir: Fiona's cousin Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Together with his friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-in-Boots (Antonio Banderas), Shrek sails to his new adventure, but another unexpected event shocks the ogre: Fiona is pregnant. To make things worse, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) is back and is decided to conquer Far Far Away and destroy Shrek forever.Following the story that Andrew Adamson conceived for the planned sequels (apparently three sequels will be made), writers J. David Stem, David N. Weiss and Jon Zack join forces with script doctors Jeffrey Price and Peter s. Seaman, in an attempt to recapture the magic that made the first two 'Shrek' movies a hit. Well, it could be said that they succeeded to a certain extent, as the movie still retains that wild anarchic humor that made the first one so fresh and interesting. While obviously lacking the novelty factor of the first one, the movie packs several great jokes surrounding Shrek's mid-life crisis and his doubts about paternity, as well as giving the 'Shrek touch' to the Arthurian legend. As the other two films, this movie is also based around a life lesson, and while it's handled a little bit less subtle than in the other two, the writers manage to make it work fine.Chris Miller and Raman Hui (Animatiors of the first two 'Shrek' films) are the ones now in the director's seat, and together they manage to build what's probably one of the best looking movies of the last years. As former animators, the two directors put a lot of care in the visual design of the film, making an extremely detailed film, with a very fluid animation and wonderful character design. It certainly looks like the crew at DreamWorks have certainly improved their craft, as 'Shrek the Third' has probably the best CG animation in human beings done to date. Miller and Hui remain faithful to the 'Shrek' style that Adamson created for the two films, so fans of the first two won't be disappointed by the looks of this film. The film flows at a nice pace, although one would prefer that the same care taken in the visual department had been taken in the development of the script.As usual, Mike Myers adds a lot of charm to the character, still making an excellent performance as the grumpy yet very lovable green monster, and this time he receives many of the best scenes too. As Donkey, Eddie Murphy keeps being hilarious, although since Shrek took the spotlight this time, Donkey's role is drastically reduced to mere companion together with Antonio Banderas' Puss-in-boots. As Puss, Banderas still steals every scene he is in, as unlike Murphy, his character did received a development this time. As Fiona, Cameron Diaz has less to do this time, but she still makes a solid performance. Finally, Ruppert Everett is delightful as the pathetic Prince Charming. In the supporting roles we find Julie Andrews and John Cleese reprising their roles as Fiona's parents in a good way, and Justin Timberlake and Eric Idle are nice additions to the cast.While 'Shrek the Third' is by no means a bad film, those expecting something on the level of the previous installments of the franchise will be left a bit underwhelmed. While the lack of the surprise factor of the first two can be considered an important reason for this, the writers are not without fault. The main problem I see is that they have an enormous cast of likable characters to put on the film, and by trying to give each one of them a moment to shine the result is that many end up tragically underused, never reaching the full potential of what the writers intended them to be (Eric Idle's Merlin is the perfect example of this). Anyways, despite these problems the movie still works, mainly because the humor is still as wild and clever as usual, so fans of the series won't be disappointed in that aspect.While some may criticize the more mature nature of this movie (there's nothing inappropriate, but it's clear that more jokes are aimed to adults than to children), I think it fits perfectly within the 'Shrek' universe, as even when the movie is quite popular with kids, it's target audience has always been those young adults who grew up with Disney's fairy tales. Those who didn't like the previous films won't find anything to make them change their mind, but those who loved them will find that the magic is still there. 7/10",7,1,2,1 July 2007
The Illusionist," Very well done film
","After a very modest debut in 2002 with 'Interview with the Assassin', director Neil Burger practically came out of nowhere with this impressive period piece that blends subtly the artistic vision of an 'arthouse' film with the commercial appeal of a summer blockbuster. 'The Ilusionist' is a remarkably well-done tale of drama and romance with a touch of fantasy, that while probably not entirely original or historically accurate, surely not only brings back the joy of watching a period piece, but the overall pleasure of watching movies as a whole. This may sound exaggerated (and probably it is), but in a year lacking good surprises, this is a film that really stands out among the rest. Not an easy feat for a modest independent film.Based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, 'The Ilusionist' is the tale of two different, but very similar persons. Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is in charge of arresting Eisenheim (Edward Norton), the famous illusionist that has shocked Vienna with his extraordinary talent and nearly impossible tricks. Something has done Eisenheim that has forced the Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) to order his arrest and Uhl must now do the deed. However, soon Uhl discovers that the secrets of Eisenheim the Ilusionist are related to Sophie (Jessica Biel), Prince Leopold's fiancée.Adapted to the screen by Burger himself, 'The Ilusionist' is a tale appropriately surrounded by illusions. As Uhl's character tries to uncover the nature of Eisenheim's powers, we get deeper and deeper inside the illusion crafted by the writers. While the story could had easily being about the confrontation between the illusionist and the detective, it opts for the romance angle, a move that while sacrifices a great deal of originality, is well-developed and probably suits the overall tone and mood Burger crafts with his romanticizes version of the turn of the century Vienna. The story in turn comprises both Uhl's investigation as well as the tale of the forbidden love between Eisenheim and Sophie, keeping a nice balance between both and a good deal of mystery that makes the final conclusion a great spectacle.Visually the film is extremely good for the budget Burger had, considering its not an easy task to recreate a period piece. A highlight of the film, is the beautiful cinematography (by Dick Pope) that evokes the early silent films in a way that fits the movie perfectly. Philip Glass' score is very good, although at times feels a bit too modern (like out of place), giving an odd sensation. Still, the film works remarkably well thanks to Burger's precise direction that give life to Millhauser's story with a captivating artistic vision.Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are both excellent in their roles, being another of the strong points of the film. Norton delivers a classy performance that once again shows off that his talent is still there and only needs the right direction. Giamatti delivers the best acting in the movie, as Chief Inspector Uhl, he becomes our eyes and takes us through Eisenheim's illusions in a very real, albeit subtle performance. Jessica Biel is probably the weakest link in the cast, as while she looks the part, shows almost no chemistry with Norton, as if she was uncomfortable. The surprise comes from Rufus Sewell, who is both frightening and charming as Crown Prince Leopold in a way that it's a joy to hate him.'The Ilusionist' is a terrific film considering Burger's little experience, but it has some small problems that are impossible to not notice. First of all, it's probably quite predictable, due to its unoriginal love story. However, this by no means makes it a boring film, as Burger's storytelling makes the same old story look new and fresh again, making up for its unoriginal tale. The CGI used in the film is a bit excessive and noticeable, but again, nothing that would spoil the entertainment it provides. Finally, as written above, I thought that Biel's performance is clearly overshadowed by her cast-mates, who deliver a wonderful job making Biel look a bit out of place.Despite those troubles, 'The Ilusionist' succeeds in delivering a captivating story that never becomes boring or tiresome. Without the budget of a blockbuster, Burger creates one of the best films of the year, without compromising his vision and with very good results. He certainly shows promise, let's hope his talent is not another illusion. 8/10",8,0,1,18 October 2006
Transformers," Good fun, but nothing else...
","To most kids growing up in the 80s, the word 'Transformers' had one very special meaning: fabulous vehicles able to transform into giant robots. And when I say 'most kids', I don't mean only American kids, as this concept, created by the Japanese toy company Takara, became truly a worldwide phenomenon when in 1984 the American company Hasbro launched the 'Transformers' toy line with a captivating back-story. What started as a toy line became a full fledged epic tale detailing the adventures of the Autobots, a group of heroic Transformers who protected Earth from an evil faction of their own people who called themselves Decepticons. More than 10 years later, 'Transformers' remains a popular concept, and proof of that is the fact that filmmaker Michael Bay has directed a live action film about it. Sadly, the result is far from being more than meets the eye.In 'Transformers', Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a young high school student whose biggest wish is to own a car in order to impress his beautiful classmate Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). Unfortunately for him, all he can afford is an old rusted Camaro with a tendency to fail at the most inappropriate occasions. One night, he watches his car move by itself, and he follows it to a junkyard, where it transforms into Autobot Bumblebee (Mark Ryan). This won't be the last of his surprises, as after this discovery, he'll be chased by another autonomous vehicle, a police car. Bumblebee manages to save Sam and takes him to his fellow Autobots. Their leader, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), explains Sam that this is only the beginning of a new chapter in their constant war with the Decepticons, but that Sam has the key to something that could end it once and for all.Developed by writers John Rogers, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, the screenplay for 'Transformers' essentially moves between two main stories: the constant war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and Sam's coming of age story. In fact, this last theme becomes the most important of the two, as the film focuses a lot on Sam's friendship with his sentient car, Bumblebee, as well as his wish of being Mikaela's boyfriend. Several more subplots are added, some very interesting and some pretty pointless, but unfortunately, the writers do a poor job in tying everything together and the result is a convoluted story that feels awkward in its poor balance of action and comedy. The writer's attempt to develop their character is certainly commendable, as they truly manage to humanize them in a fairly believable way. Sadly, it's not good enough to save the script.As usual with Michael Bay films, his style 'Transformers' is more eye candy than real storytelling, as he puts a lot more emphasis on fast moving action scenes filled with special effects than in the story the writers delivered for him. Of course, I know it's obvious that the special effects of the giant robots is the movie's main selling point, and they are the reason the movie was made in the first time; however, Bay's trademark quick-cut style of editing together with his shaky camera-work make very hard to fully appreciate the work of the special effects team, as Bay seems to believe that to make a dynamic action film he needs to keep the camera constantly moving without a real reason. If there's something to praise in Bay's directing, that would be his decision of making the Transformers look the most realistic possible, as it adds a lot to the epic nature of the storyline.The acting in the film is pretty much average, with Shia LaBeouf making a very effective performance as Sam, although he is in no way remarkable or outstanding. Mikaela Fox is sadly of the ones who make an awful job, as in this movie she proves that she was only hired because of her looks, not because of any real talent. On the other hand Josh Duhamel is truly one of the highlights of the movie, and one of the few who really adds a lot of power to the film. Hopefully Duhamel will become a rising action star in the future. In a nice detail, Peter Cullen reprises his role as the voice of Optimus Prime, and once again gives his character that the powerful presence it had in the cartoon. Unfortunately, that can't be said of Hugo Weaving, whose great job as Megatron's voice gets lost by an overuse of sound effects in his voice-work.Personally, the biggest problem I have with 'Transformers' is not that it's bad (it is not), it is that it could had been a lot better given the elements Bay had to work with. I'm not saying the script is a masterpiece, as it seriously lacks focus and fails at mixing comedy and action, but the approach director Michael Bay used in the film only made it feel even more mediocre than what it is. While the movie has a wonderful visual look (no doubt thanks to Bay's experience making commercials), his frantic editing and sloppy narrative diminish the quality of Mitchell Amundsen's cinematography and the special effects team's masterful work. I won't deny that there are instances where his style works perfectly, and that the movie gets really entertaining in more than one occasion, but I couldn't help but feeling that I was watching a long commercial instead of the epic battle of robots that the advertising promised.'Transformers' is one of those movies that provide instant entertainment and give the impression of being pretty cool, but end up feeling shallow when one begins to seriously think about them. That's probably the best advice to enjoy 'Transformers': not to think too seriously about it, as ultimately it is as shallow as a TV commercial. It's a fun movie with great special effects and some good performances, but it's not the great action movie that it could had been. 6/10",6,1,3,12 September 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Back with a vengeance!
","After the enormous critical and commercial success earned by 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction', director Quentin Tarantino found himself in the desired position of being able to do literally anything he wanted. So after the commercial failure of the underrated gem, 'Jackie Brown', back in 1997, he spent 6 years preparing what would be his ultimate tribute to the 70s and the films he loves so much. 'Kill Bill' is the name of the movie where Tarantino shows off everything he admires of cinema while telling the story of a nameless character (created by Uma Thurman) in a simple story of revenge spiced up by a retro 70s imagery and countless of references to classic movies. At its core, it's a very stylized action film, but 'Kill Bill' is also an ode to those films (Westerns, Crime and Martial Arts films mainly) that gave fun to Mr. Tarantino when he was a young lad.As written above, the plot is actually very simple; four years after being attacked during her wedding by her former teammates, a former professional assassin codenamed Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) awakes from a coma discovering that everyone at the chapel that day (including her unborn baby) have been murdered. Decided to take revenge on those who ruined her life, the Black Mamba (now The Bride) makes a list of the ones that attacked her that day and starts her quest hunting for the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad until she fins the leader. Her former boss and ex lover, Bill (David Carradine).Many critics have called 'Kill Bill' negatively a prime example of 'style over substance' film-making, but I think that those critics are missing the point. In the end, 'Kill Bill' is not about if The Bride succeeds or not, but about how and what she does to achieve her goal; and instead of being another exercise in storytelling, this film is actually a very graphic love letter to 70s cinema, complete with all its clichés and imagery. From the Kato masks to the Samurai duels, and from the Hattori Hanzo character (played by Sonny Chiba) to Bruce Lee's yellow jumper, 'Kill Bill' is a gorgeous tribute to all those classic action films of old.Despite being an overtly visual and stylish action film, Tarantino's strength has always being the dialogs, and so he manages to make the simple story interesting by focusing on the details of the plot, mainly the back-story of the characters. Developing the characters has always been an essential for Tarantino, and 'Kill Bill' is not an exception. It's really this focus what gives the film heart making it to stand out among other films about violence (as violence seems to be the theme of at least 'Vol. 1') while keeping the '70s tribute' angle of the film. Crafted with a fast-packed style that looks like a stylized mixture of western and martial arts movie genres, that flows smoothly never becoming boring or tiresome.Uma Thurman is really the force that drives the film, and on her shoulders is the responsibility of the film's success. Fortunately, she manages to create a complex character that while very aggressive, its still very feminine and really likable despite the fact that she is a cold blooded killing machine. Lucy Liu delivers a low-key performance as O-Ren Ishii, former teammate of 'The Bride' and the main enemy in this chapter. Basically an antithesis of The Bride, O-Ren is also quite complex in the sense that is a character that has made a lot of sacrifices to become a top assassin and head of the Japanese mafia. The final confrontation between the two is certainly the highlight of the film. The rest of the cast is very effective, although we don't see too much of them (Tarantino makes the wise move of focusing on the development of the two main characters only). It's nice to see Sonny Chiba, Gordon Liu and Kenji Oba in cameos across the film.'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is just the first part of The Bride's Saga, covering her awakening and the beginning of her revenge, as well as the more action-oriented part of the saga. It could also be said that this is the '70s martial arts tribute' part of the story, as 'Vol. 2' is situated in a slightly different context (I even believe they were conceived as two films from the start), although still a '70s tribute' film that concludes the story. Overall the film is quite exiting, although it probably won't be too attractive to people expecting a more complex and detailed story. While the characters are very well-developed and the plot is rich in details, the film's focus is highly visual rather than plot-driven, so people expecting an insightful film in this aspect (or even people expecting similar film to 'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Jackie Brown') will be highly disappointed.While personally I consider 'Vol. 2' a vastly superior movie, 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is an excellent action film that can stand on its own delivering great entertainment and fast-packed action in high doses. As a beautifully done tribute to 70s cinema, this movie excels. 8/10",8,0,2,24 October 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," Great action-packed thrill ride!
","Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are probably the two most recognizable faces of the generation of filmmakers who had their start in the independent scene of the early 90s. Rodriguez had a tremendous success with his western-inspired action movie 'El Mariachi' while Tarantino reached fame and glory after updating heist movies in 'Reservoir Dogs'. Their friendship lead them to make movies together starting with 'Four Rooms', but together with make-up masters Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger the two young directors crafted one of the most original movies of the 90s: 'From Dusk Till Dawn'.The plot starts with the escape of two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Tarantino himself) and their effort to reach Mexico kidnapping the family of a faith-less preacher named Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) who was traveling with his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and his son Scott (Ernest Liu). In their escape the group will arrive to a Mexican strip club where nothing is what it seems.The story (by Kurtzman) is a very good mix of action, western and horror cleverly put together in Tarantino's witty script. Rodriguez direction gives the film the a 70s feeling that gives the movie a Drive-In spirit pretty much in tone with the plot. In fact, at times the film feels like an updated version of exploitation action films of that era. This lack of pretensions makes it even more enjoyable as it never tries to be something else than pure entertainment.The movie is interestingly divided in two, the first half dedicated to establishing the relationships between the characters, particularly the complicated clash of the Geckos and the Fullers, in a typical Tarantino style crime/drama fashion; on the other hand, the second half is an action packed thrill ride on the style of 70s action movies that clearly shows John Carpenter's influence over Rodriguez. While it is definitely a tribute to their influences, the Rodriguez/Tarantino team create a solid movie that stands on its own as a very original take on horror movies.The acting is very effective, with George Clooney carrying the film as the cool-headed older brother who has to take care of his psychotic younger brother. Tarantino is average, but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. Apearances by Salma Hayek and make-up virtuoso Tom Savini have small but unforgettable roles. Savini steals the film in his role as a biker that brings back memories of his part in Romero's classic 'Dawn of the Dead'. All in all is a very complete and solid cast that certainly gives the movie a very special flavor.The special effects by KNB are top-notch, but the CGI used in some scenes is poor when compared to the traditional prosthetic make-up employed in the rest of the film. While the violence is never intended to be realistic, the poor CGI at times make it look more cartoon-like than what it was supposed to be, but it is not a real damaging flaw and the film is still highly enjoyable.Rodriguez has always done films to have fun, and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers (Tarantino included). His lack of pretensions and his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning, they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 8/10",8,55,76,25 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Another good Harry Potter film...
","More than 10 years after the publication of the first book in the 'Harry Potter' series, there's no doubt that J. K. Rowling's fantasy novels are on the way of becoming classics of the genre due to its imaginative world and its captivating story, which has gone from simple tales of adventure to darker and more complex themes as its main character, the young wizard Harry Potter grows up. The fourth installment of the series, 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' began this maturing process, as in that book our hero discovered that fighting against evil, embodied in the figure of Lord Voldemort, wasn't a child's game, as the forces of evil do not hesitate in killing innocents. 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix', fifth novel in the series, continued and expanded this transformation, and naturally, the movie adaptation followed the same path.As usual, we find Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) spending the summer at the house of his hateful relatives, the Dursleys, however, something feels different this time, as even when he was the one who discovered that Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) had returned, nobody, not even his good friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), had attempted to get in touch with him. Harry suspects something strange is going on, and his suspicion gets confirmed when a group of Dementors attack him and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling), forcing him to use magic to save him. After this event, Harry is informed that he is now expelled from Hogwarts, however, the Order of the Phoenix, a group of elite wizards lead by Harry's former professor Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson), appear at the Dursleys' house to take Harry away. It seems that Harry's fifth year has started a bit earlier this time.Replacing Steve Kloves as scriptwriter for 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is writer Michael Goldenberg, who faces the mammoth challenge of adapting Rowling's longest book to film. As any fan of the series should expect, details from the novel had to be omitted, but it must be said that Goldenberg manages to create a script that despite the omissions remains true to the story's spirit by keeping the core themes and staying faithful to the main plot. One of the key elements of the novel's plot is Harry's angst, and Goldenberg manages to successfully explore this aspect in his screenplay, devoting a great deal of it to the developing of Harry's character (something missing in the previous installment). Sadly, this has the consequence of limiting the screen time of the rest of the characters, as even major character such as Ron and Hermione get reduced screen time in this occasion.As the new person in the director's seat, David Yates wisely decide to keep a sense of continuity between films and follows the same dark visual style that has been part of the series since the third installment ('Prisoner of Azkaban'), keeping the film in tone with the more mature challenges the characters face now that they have grown up and the evil's presence is stronger. A major theme in the movie is how the life at Hogwarts is affected by the many political conspiracies to hide the fact that Voldemort has returned, and fortunately Yates manages to pay enough attention to this aspect without taking the focus out of the main characters. While Yates does give his film a very fast pace, he manages to make the story easy to understand even to those unfamiliar with the novel and the many details that weren't included in the adaptation.One of the most noticeable things in 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is definitely how much has Daniel Radcliffe improved as an actor, as after many years of being the weakest link in the young trio, he finally shows up a considerable development and a real domain over dramatic scenes. Of course, it helps a lot that the script is almost entirely dedicated to his character, although sadly, this also means that Emma Watson and specially Rupert Grint receive almost zero chance to shine, although both make great performances despite this. The rest of the supporting characters suffer of this same thing as well, although Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson and specially Alan Rickman deliver remarkable acting despite the short screen time they have. However, the highlight of the film is Imelda Staunton's acting as Dolores Umbridge, as she delivers what's simply an unforgettable performance.As written above, anyone expecting a faithful adaptation of the books will be sorely disappointed. To expect the level of detail Kloves and director Chris Columbus had in the first two films is simply pointless, but that doesn't mean Yates and Goldenberg are not talented, one has consider that since 'Prisoner of Azkaban', Rowling's seres has grown bigger and deeper than the first two books. True, it's sad not to see some of the most famous scenes of the series in the movie, but what Yates and Goldenberg have done is still impressive as the movie does exactly what the novel did in a flawless way: it gives depth to the characters and completes their transition from kids to teenagers. In fact, the movie's real problem is that it's a bit too fast paced for its own sake, with the events happening at times too quickly to be noticed. I'm sure nobody would complain if 20 extra minutes were added to help slow the pace a bit.'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' may not be an adaptation as faithful as hardcore fans would want, but in the end the approach the filmmakers have taken since the third chapter has given the series an identity of its own. This fifth installment is a great addition to the series, as it delivers perfectly the intended message: Harry Potter is not a kid anymore, and his biggest challenge awaits ahead. 8/10",7,0,0,19 August 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Great movie, despite its flaws...
","I went to watch the new adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel 'Pride & Prejudice' knowing that the lead actress, Keira Knightley, was nominated to an Academy Award. While the Awards may not always be accurate, I had big expectations of her performance in the movie, and sadly, i was disappointed. Despite this, the movie is a brilliant adaptation of the classic and makes justice to Austen's work.Knightley plays our main character, Elizabeth Bennet; who is a woman with a strong will uncommon in her age. Her family has economic troubles, increased by the fact that her father, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) is old, and since none of his five daughters has married, with his death the property will go to the next male relative. For this reason, her mother (Brenda Blethyn) is completely obsessed with getting her daughters married.Nothing of this matters for Elizabeth, since she has a bad opinion of men, an opinion who seems to be confirmed by Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), a man who has just come to the village with Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods),a rich man who falls in love with Elizabeth's older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike). Darcy's apparently is a selfish arrogant man full of pride and this may confirm Elizabeth's opinion about men, or is this just only prejudice? Jane Austen's novel is adapted to screen one more time in the debut of Joe Wright as a director. Deborah Moggach's screenplay is remarkably good and the adaptation is quite accurate. While it is not the most faithful adaptation, it is the most adequate, as it keeps the spirit of Austen's work and its everlasting charm. It is not free of flaws, as the very short screen-time of Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) truly affects the power of later actions of the main characters.Nevertheless, Joe Wright makes a very good job as a director, and he gives us images of enormous beauty and is capable of printing the soul of the written word in film. The superb camera-work is outstanding but at times, its beauty seems to overshadow the cast.This takes me to the film's weakest link. Don't get me wrong, most of the cast have done a great job, particularly Tom Hollander as the Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins; his performances is remarkable and gives a sympathetic view to his pathetic character.The problem in the cast, is that the two main characters are very strong and in stands the backbone of the tale, the clash of two very stubborn and strong wills, however, in the film both Knightley and Macfayden lack that strength and make the characters not as believable. Keira Knightley's performance is a bit above average, a disappointment considering she was nominated for this movie, although she manages to carry the film with grace. The problem is that Macfayden gives a very poor acting as he seems unable to transmit Mr. Darcy's powerful presence.However, this flaw doesn't hurt the film and 'Pride & Prejudice' remains a great film adaptation. Maybe it won't be the best of all, but is a good version that fits quite well the current times. 7/10",7,1,3,15 February 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," Behind the Music: Spinal Tap
","In 1984, Rob Reiner was already a TV veteran, but when he did his first theatrical feature, his choice was a bit odd for a 'debut'. Along with friends Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean, they crafted a monumental satire that stands out as a landmark of comedy: A documentary that shows the life of one of Britain's legendary heavy metal bands, Spinal Tap.The 'mockumentary' follows Spinal Tap in their latest tour across the U.S. after releasing their album 'Smell the glove'. Famous Commercials Director Mary DiBergi (Rob Reiner himself) is our guide and he follows the band everywhere, from parties to concerts, and we witness the brilliant genius of Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), and whoever is their drummer in turn.The satire is constant an outstanding, nothing is left untouched and we have fun with all the antics of the failed rock-stars. Really, this is a work of a team, as our main characters are as real as they can be (in fact, many people thought that Spinal Tap was real). This is probably its most remarkable feature, everything is so realistic that is fun. The creative team really did an amazing job with the characters.Fans of rock n' roll will find references to everything from Eric Clapton to Kiss, from The Beatles to Black Sabbath and from Bon Jovi to Mötley Crüe. Nobody escapes from the sharp satire this movie uses. However, it is important to point out that the songs were also written by the team, and that Spinal Tap really do perform their set (they also did a real tour in-character for a while too).The acting is great, as I wrote above, the performances are very real, so real that is quite hard to believe that Spinal never existed. It's hard to give credit to only one person because the movie is the work of a team. Everyone did a great job in keeping the movie look as real as it can be, Reiner, the main stars, and the countless extras, it is a perfectly crafted 'documentary'.If a flaw can be found in the movie, is that it is really more rewarding when you are aware of the things they make fun of (specially since real rock-stars have stated that things depicted in the movie really have happened to some of them). However, this doesn't mean that you have to be a rocker to understand it; the situations are quite funny and the humor is so clever, that actually anyone will enjoy it.11/10.

Saw," Very good horror film!
","Before 'Saw' premiered at Sundance festival in January 2004, few could have imagined that this new horror film would be part of a new wave of horror films that brought back gore and violence to the screens and moved away from the now formulaic style of self-referential teen slashers started with Wes Craven's 'Scream' back in 1996. To call 'Saw' revolutionary would be an exaggeration, but it's fair to point out that it was among the very the first of this resurgence that received wide public acclaim and became popular in mainstream crowds, proving that an R-rated horror film still can achieve financial success.'Saw' begins with two men waking up in an old, and apparently abandoned industrial washroom. They don't know each other, and apparently the only thing they have in common is that they are both chained to the pipes with only a small saw as a tool, not enough to cut the chain, but good enough to cut their feet. Trapped in this nightmarish scenario, the men try to figure out an escape to their situation, and get to know each other; one is a young photographer named Adam (Leigh Whannell) and the other is a surgeon named Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes). Lawrence realizes they have been kidnapped by the notorious serial killer named 'Jigsaw', a man who puts their victims in deadly situations that most of the times lead to their deaths.Written by Leigh Whannell and director James Wan, 'Saw' gives a new edge to the serial killer stories turning what otherwise would be another thriller into a full-fledged horror movie. The premise of the film is quite original, and via flashbacks we discover the past of both Gordon and Adam, as well as the story of this killer named Jigsaw, whose identity is a mystery and seems to be destined to be the bogeyman of this decade. Full of plot twists and with a cleverly hidden secret, the film keeps the mystery until the end, making an enjoyable and for the most part rewarding thriller.But as written above, 'Saw' goes beyond the common conception of 'thriller' and adds a horror edge closer to 70s grind-house than to otherwise similar films like 'Seven' or 'Silence of the Lambs'. Director James Wan focuses on the graphic violence of Jigsaw deathtraps and makes 'Saw' a visually different kind of film, delivering a very good mix of detective story and gory horror film. However, Wan can't escape the influence of music videos and the now-clichéd use of shaky camera and rapid cuts. At times the overuse of this device breaks the suspenseful pace of the film in sadly awful ways.The acting is for the most part effective, without nothing really spectacular, although good considering the budget. Leigh Whannell delivers a good performance and while Elwes' accent at time slips out, he is a nice counterpart for Whannell's character. Danny Glover and Ken Leung appear in supporting roles, as the cops following Jigsaw's case. the two have great chemistry together, but it's safe to say Leung steals most of the scenes they share.'Saw' suffers a lot from the extensive overuse of that music video style described above. Together with the metal soundtrack completely break the atmosphere of the story and look strange and out of place (as the characters are far from teenagers). The flashbacks are for the most part a well used device, although they too tend to break the momentum from time to time. Most critics have labeled the script of 'unbelievable' and numerate the many plot holes the film has, and while they are right in many ways, 'Saw' manages to work fine with all those plot holes because in the end, the core story is well-handled.In some way, 'Saw' came up as a wake up call for the horror genre, in many ways superior to previous attempts to revive the genre like 'Cabin Fever', but still far from perfect. Still, it's safe to say that James Wan and Leigh Whannell have crafted a nice and original new entry in the genre and may represent a new source of thrills in the future. While maybe not a classic yet, 'Saw' is a very recommended films for fans and non-fans of the horror genre. 7/10",7,0,1,14 September 2006
The Fly," Simply Outstanding!
","By 1986, director David Cronenberg was one of the rising stars in the horror genre, having a bright career in his natal Canada where he had directer modern classics such as 'The Brood', 'Scanners' and the masterpiece of the genre, 'Videodrome'. After directing his first movie in the U.S., 'The Dead Zone' in 1983, Cronenberg was chosen to direct his first big budget project in the U.S.: the remake of the classic movie 'The Fly'.The plot of the original movie was kept at its core, a brilliant scientist, Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), creates a teleporting machine, but when he experiments teleporting himself, something goes wrong and he gets combined with a fly. That is the plot outline and all the movie has in common with the original, because Cronenberg took a whole different approach to the story.While in the original movie the doctor turned himself into a giant fly, in Cronenberg's movie Seth Brundle doesn't change instantly, his mutation is progressive, at first not apparent but later he becomes a new creature, something that has never existed before, as Brundle describes himself, he becomes 'the offspring of man and fly'.The script is simply brilliant, not only it explores Seth Brundle's tragedy, the inclusion of Geena Davis as the reporter who falls in love with the scientist only to discover that his lover is slowly changing into something unnatural plays an important part in Brundle's tragedy. The story is full of metaphors and it is the ultimate romance/horror tragedy.Now, all this would not be possible without the acting of both Goldblum and Davis, their chemistry together is remarkable and their performances carry the film with the power enough to give us insight in the tragedy that slowly gets in the middle of their love.David Cronenberg's direction is outstanding and this is one of his best works. 'The Fly' truly shows his progression as an artist and it is an important step in his career. In 'The Fly' he successfully mixes the character study of previous works like 'The Brood' or 'The Dead Zone' with the SFX-packed action of 'Scanners' and 'Videodrome'. this is without a doubt one of his most accomplished pictures.Overall, I could go on praising this film and yet it would not be enough. 'The Fly' is not only a modern classic of the horror genre (so much that it has casted a shadow over the original), it is a perfect example of the art of film-making. 10/10",10,1,2,6 February 2006
Reservoir Dogs," A true classic on its own right...
","It seems that it was only yesterday when in 1992 the then unknown director Quentin Tarantino screened his debut film, 'Reservoir Dogs', at Sundance with great success suddenly becoming the new star of independent cinema and an the most promising director of that 'class of 1992'. Of course, later came 'Pulp Fiction' and what started as a phenomenon within the indie scene became a worldwide success starting a trend of imitators and making Tarantino a powerful figure in Hollywood. But despite the rights and wrongs of Tarantino's career, the groundbreaking 'Reservoir Dogs' is a fine example of excellent cinema and a classic of the 90s on its own right.The plot begins with two criminals, codenamed Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), arriving to an abandoned mortuary. Orange is badly hurt, and soon we discover that they are members of a group of criminals hired to make a robbery, and that the crime went wrong when the police showed up ending in a shootout where the two of them barely escaped alive. After another survivor, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), arrives, the group realizes that they were set up by an infiltrated agent, but since only their boss knows the details about them (including the real names), anybody in the room could be the traitor. Finally, the arrival of another member, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), complicates the plot, as the other three are sure that he is the one who betrayed them.Without a doubt, 'Reservoir Dogs'' greatest strength is in the remarkably well-written script by Tarantino himself. The four main characters are fleshed out in a way that makes them very real, very human; each of them with a distinct series of personal traits that one can't help to feel that you know really them (something ironic, considering they are supposed not to know each other). The whole situation, built as a heist film where the heist is never seen (only told via flashbacks), makes these four personalities collide and actually the relationships between them become the point of the film itself. It's not about the crime itself, but about the criminals who committed it.Tarantino's skill as a director is nowhere near his skill as a writer, but still he creates a very stylish film letting all his influences flourish, particularly the french new wave and classic noir heist films. Although it's safe to say that here they don't become as blatant as in this later 'genre tribute' movies 'Jackie Brown' and 'Kill Bill'. With very simple, but effective camera-work and a great use of incidental music as a soundtrack, Tarantino crafts a superb film despite its budgetary limitations shows a very promising talent with huge potential as a filmmaker.The four main characters are wonderfully played by a very effective cast of actors. Harvey Keitel (who also produced the film) shows off his talent as the experienced Mr. White, who becomes some kind of paternal figure to the newbie Mr. Orange, in another of Tim Roth's excellent performances. Steve Buscemi gives his usual high quality work and the cast is completed by a Michael Madsen with tremendous presence and total control of the screen. Supporting characters are played by the very effective Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. Convict-turned-author Eddie Bunker and Tarantino himself appear in small roles with mixed-up results (Tarantino is not really a good actor).The film is remarkably well-done for its budget, and despite being set almost entirely in a single room, it never feels tiresome or boring. Tarantino's violent crime drama has hold up well and personally, it rivals his follow-up, 'Pulp Fiction', and at times it surpasses it. Some minor flaws include Tarantino's own lack of acting skills and an use of violence (not graphic, but somehow disturbing) that may be excessive to some people (although it fits perfectly within the movie's theme and atmosphere). Almost a flawless film.Wheter one loves or hates Tarantino becomes meaningless at judging this film, its qualities makes it speak for itself as one of the best movies about crime ever made. It's hard to dismiss its raw power and creative craftsmanship. Maybe not a perfect film, but definitely the closest Tarantino has been to make one. 9/10",9,4,8,8 September 2006
The Descent," Brutal horror classic!
","Neil Marshall gained his entry to horror hall of fame and a cult-like following after only one film, his hugely acclaimed werewolf masterpiece 'Dog Soldiers'. Now, and to prove that he is not a one hit wonder, he returns to the genre with this powerful movie that takes the horror back to its roots and keeps the tension to the max. Just like his previous movie, 'The Descent' seems to be destined to become a horror classic; and along with Aja's 'Haute Tension' and Zombie's 'The Devil's Rejects', prove that the horror genre is alive and kicking.The plot tells the story of Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), a extreme sports enthusiast who, a year after the traumatic event that killed his husband and daughter, decides to make a new excursion not only to prove herself, but also to reunite with her friends. Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza), the expert adventurer of the team, leads the group but their previous experience won't prepare them to what they will find inside the cave.'The Descent' is, at its core, a tale of survival horror, but it also explores psychological horror, as Sarah's mental state is balancing between sanity and madness. That and the claustrophobic feeling of isolation inside the cave really sets the perfect mood in the film. The movie takes its time to explode, slowly developing the relations between the characters before and during the trip.While the story is very simple and at times predictable, it is the execution of the film what shows its true brilliance. The awesome use of lights and shadows to create tension and to distinguish between characters is superb, and the music follows the actions in the film with perfect tone. The dark atmosphere and the feeling of claustrophobia enhances the suspense and the film's rhythm during the last third of the film feels just like a roller-coaster. It is truly, a descent to madness.The characters are very well defined and it is a nice change of pace to see a cast of young adult women instead of the typical teens that seem to infest modern horror movies these days. The acting is very good, and Shauna Macdonald makes a great lead character. The rest of the cast was also very good, and all seemed very believable in their roles, specially Alex Reid and Saskia Mulder.If a flaw is to be found in the movie, it would be probably the fact that the story is quite simple and a bit predictable. Unlike 'Dog Soldiers', this one is a more straightforward survival horror movie; however, Marsdhall's perfect direction and the great performance of those involved truly makes the difference between a typical horror movie and a soon-to-be classic.'The Descent' may be a proof that even the simplest story can make a terrific movie if the proper care is taken. Neil Marshall excels in this film and confirms what everybody thought after 'Dog Soldier', that this British young man is a name to look after in the future. 8/10",8,3,7,14 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Neither bad nor great, just entertaining...
","Dan Brown's novel 'The Da Vinci Code' quickly became a best seller not only because of its easy-to-read narrative and its thrilling plot of conspiracies and riddles, it received notoriety due to the criticism it makes to the Catholic church and the harsh portrait it makes of the Opus Dei. While the only real fact in 'The Da Vinci Code' may be its status as an entertaining and well-written work of fiction, it is more than enough to make the transition to film and it is in writer Akiva Goldsman and director Ron Howard's hands to make it possible.The now well-known plot starts with Professor Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) being killed in one of the halls of Louvre museum by the mysterious Silas (Paul Bettany), a religious man with dark purposes. Before dying, Sauniere leaves a series of clues that only his granddaughter Sophie (Audrey Tautou) will understand, but she'll need the aid of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), famous historian, to solve the puzzle. A race to solve the code begins as Silas seems decided to make them stop in their quest and the french police is after them.Ron Howard makes a competent adaptation following faithfully the book making the movie almost as entertaining as the source novel. Just like in the book, the plot unfolds smoothly and the film never gets boring or tiresome. While his loyalty to the source novel is really appreciated, Howard's film is overall bland and never takes full advantage of its source. The works of art that Brown describes with great detail in the book are rarely appreciated in the movie and visually the film ends up looking as any other TV crime drama. Brown's novel is definitely not a literature classic, but it deserved a more creative development in film.Writer Akiva Goldsman takes an straight-forward take on the novel and surprisingly make it follow the book to the letter. Fans of the novel won't find anything missing, however, it is fair to point out that some changes were made although the plot is relatively intact. The only major change was that Sophie's character was considerably diminished, something odd considering that Dan Brown's novel has feminism as its most important value and thus she is a character as skilled and competent as Langdon.Howard's regular Tom Hanks is surprisingly good as Langdon and while at times his age becomes apparent, his portrait of the everyman makes him a good choice for the role. Audrey Tautou is also good, but her character was nowhere as developed as in the book, making her just a simple sidekick for Hank's character. The one who really stands out is Sir Ian McKellen, who plays Langdon old friend Sir Leigh Teabing; McKellen completely makes the character his own and steals every scene he is in, displaying his domain of the stage and his great talent as an actor. Paul Bettany and Alfred Molina complete the cast and give their respective characters depth and dignity.'The Da Vinci Code' is a very well-done film, but still it feels like a missed opportunity of making something really epic. Howard's uninspired take at times makes the film feel too simple for its original ambitions and may leave fans of the novel expecting a little extra effort in making Brown's story come alive. A bit more of creativity would had helped to make the movie a classic thriller instead of the simple mystery film we got.Despite its problems; the novel's thrilling plot, the great acting and the superb score (by Hans Zimmer) make the movie an enjoyable experience, and while it definitely could had been a lot better, it is a movie worth watching at least once.",6,9,17,7 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Flawed, but still very good movie
","OK. I'm a Harry Potter fan, nevertheless, I'm a fan of good cinema, so unlike most of the reviews here(who are either biased pro-Harry or biased against it) I will be as merciless & objective as I can. Here we go.The plot in a few words: In Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts, an important celebration will take place in his school. The Tri-Wizard Tournament, an international competition between England, France and Bulgaria in which the representatives are chosen by the Goblet of Fire. Harry is chosen as a fourth champion by unknown reasons and meanwhile he has begun to face the troubles of being a teenager, he must discover the mystery surrounding his election and the consequences of it.Well, the movie keeps the dark lighting & mood used previously in the third movie. Nice touch, considering that it is here where Harry Potter's story turns darker and his troubles really begin. Nevertheless, meanwhile Alfonso Cuaron kept a fantastic(almost Burtonian) feeling in the movie, while here it's a more realistic approach. It's a good change, the kids are growing, they see the world with a different eyes, and even in the wacky world of wizards & witches, they get serious.The direction is solid, Mike Newell does a great job in exploring the three main characters emotions, just like he has done in the past with romantic dramas/comedies like his famous 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' or 'Mona Lisa Smile'. He seems to be the perfect choice for this movie.The bad thing is that meanwhile we get a HUGE development of the three main characters, support cast is not that lucky. New characters Fleur, Krum, and their teachers do have development, but it's limited, while old time favorites like Snape or Hagrid appears almost as cameos. Maybe this is a flaw in the development of the script, but we have to consider that they had a hard time adapting it to the screen.I have always thought that Daniel Radcliffe was the worst actor in the previous movies, nevertheless, he shows an advance here and manages to put a performance that shows more promise than his acting in the previous movies. Rupert Grin displays his increasing talent for comedy, but it's miss Emma Watson who steals the movie. Every scene she is in it's pure gold. I see a bright future for this young actress. Her acting is a tour de force that shows how she has improved as an actress, she is ready for different roles.The SFX are awesome most of the time. The movie has probably the best art-direction of the series and has a good pace. Edition, something that most fans have complained, does a great work making an enjoyable film by keeping a good rhythm.In the end it is a very enjoyable experience by both fans of the movies, fans of the books, and the casual movie-goer. After the third movie, this is probably the best of the series.Solid 8/10. Very recommended.",8,1,4,19 November 2005
The Fountain," A very creative work by Aronofsky!
","After the release of his acclaimed feature length debut, the independent film 'Pi', back in 1998, director Darren Aronofsky became one of the most promising names of the late 90s generation of young directors. Two years after 'Pi', Aronofsky proved that he was more than a one hit wonder with his adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel 'Requiem for a Dream', a story about the consequences of drug addictions that without a doubt has become one of the first classics of the first decade of the 21st century. With such an outstanding beginning of career, it was natural that expectations for Aronofsky's next work grew to enormously high altitudes, and not few doubted that his new project, 'The Fountain', could live up to the hype surrounding it (specially after the trouble preproduction, which lasted almost 5 years). Fortunately, Aronofsky's film demonstrates once again that his first two films were note the result of luck, and that there is real talent behind his work.'The Fountain' is the story of Tomas Creo (Hugh Jackman), as he faces the fact that his beloved wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz) has terminal cancer and is close to death. A research oncologist himself, Tomas is desperately trying to find a cure for his wife's tumor, motivated by the idea that if he discovers a way to reverse brain tumors, he'll be able to save his wife. However, Izzi seems to have a different philosophy than him, and having accepted death, decides to write a book named 'The Fountain', about a Spanish conquistador looking for the legendary Tree of Life. As Tom keeps failing in his many attempts to find the cure, his mind begins to suffer the consequences, but as he seems unable to accept his wife's fate, Izzi's has prepared a way for him to overcome his grief.Written by Darren Aronofsky and Ari Handel, 'The Fountain' is essentially a love story with touches of science fiction, all spiced up with Aronofsky's ideas about philosophy. It's truly a very ambitious story, but Aronofsky manages to develop it nicely and with intelligence, avoiding the clichés and the sappiness that tend to be in movies dealing with similar themes. The philosophic themes (focusing on sociology and specially on Thanatology) are handled carefully, and while they are kept in simple and easy to understand terms, Aronofsky explores them deeply, making 'The Fountin' a remarkable study of love and the experience of grief. As usual, Aronofsky fleshes out his characters in a very realistic way, making them feel very real and human, allowing us to easily feel identified with them (somehting essential given the subject matter of the story).In 'The Fountain', Aronofsky shows a real improvement in his skills as a director, as well as a willingness to push the boundaries of his very own style of storytelling. While the story is entirely focused on the characters' emotions, he allows himself to experiment with different styles as the story takes the characters to the past and the future (where Aronofsky displays a heavy use of symbols and traces of surrealism), and interestingly, he also moves away from many of the devices that had began to be known as 'trademarks' of his style. 'The Fountain' is a very visual movie (probably more than his previous two), but despite this, Aronofsky still manages to keep the story as the main focus of the movie. On a side not, it's worth to point out that Clint Mansell's score for the movie is truly amazing, and easily one of the best of the decade.In a movie that's basically about the undying love between two characters, the performances of the actors portraying them are of great importance. Fortunately, the cast did a very good job with it, specially Hugh Jackman, who truly surprised me (I had never been impressed by his work before) and made me realize how really talented he is. His portrayal of Tom as a man who can't bear the unavoidable loss of the love of his life is truly moving. While Rachel Weisz is a really awesome actress, I couldn't help but think that this was not one of her best works, as while her character was supposed to be truly at peace, she came to me as cold and distant, making Jackman to shine even more. The supporting cast was overall very good, despite not having a lot of screen time when compared to Jackman and Weisz. Ellen Burstyn makes a small appearance and does a great job with it.'The Fountain' is a very good movie, with many good elements on its favor as the cast, the score and the brilliant cinematography (by Matthew Libatique); however, it is not exactly the masterpiece the hype made it out to be. The film's main problem lays in the very ambitious (and let's face it, pretentious) way Aronofsky crafts his movie, as while he does indeed attempts to keep the film's message easy and simple, he seems to sacrifice the story for the sake of the symbolism of his visual art. This results in a plot that looks more contrived than what it really is, and that irremediably will feel somewhat patronizing to some viewers. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but it's one that one must see with an open mind and aware that it's neither the masterpiece that the most ardent fans of Aronofsky make it to be, nor the void and pretentious trash its detractors claim it is.In the end, the movie is a really satisfying experience, as despite its troubles the movie manages to deliver a nice and intelligent story and Aronofsky's interesting views on love and death. While sadly I must say that it's not the redefinition of science fiction that Aronofsky intended it to be, I'm happy to admit that with 'The Fountain', director Aronofsky has proved that he was more than a lucky beginner, and that great things await for him in the future. 8/10",8,1,3,22 March 2007
Psycho," The Master shows how to make a film
","According to history, at the end of the 50s Hitchcock saw that many low-budget films were gaining many audience; knowing the flaws in those films, he decided to try to make a low-budget film and see what happened when in his words 'an experienced director' does a low budget film. The result was 'Psycho'.Loosely based on Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, 'Psycho' is a superbly done film in almost every aspect, and shows the perfection of Hitchcock's technique. The Master was at that time at the peak of his art.Scripwriter Joseph Stefano makes a different take on Bloch's novel and tells the story of Marion Crane, a woman who in an impulsive act steals $40 thousand dollars from her boss; in her escape, she spends the night at the Bates Motel, only to discover the dark secret that hides the owners, Norman Bates and his mother.Done with a budget of $800,000, 'Psycho' is perfectly conceived as it never goes too far from what it pretends to do. Hitchcock worked closely to Stefano in order to know exactly what type of take he was going to do.Filmed in Black and White in a time when color was already the dominant format, the sharp contrast between light and darkness is a beautiful remark of what lies hidden inside Bates Motel.Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, Marion and Norman respectively, give an outstanding performance in their roles. Perkins clearly dominates the character of Norman and it is obvious why was he type-casted as Bates, his performance and the character is so well developed by the script that is impossible to not feel empathy for him.Many words could be written about Psycho, but all that must be said is that this film shows what film-making is about. The perfect mixture of art and entertainment. Now, after many parodies, homages and sequels, the movie still retains its power and it is definitely, one of the movies every person in the world should see at least once. 10/10.

The Emperor's New Groove," Terrific comedy!
","'The Emperor's New Groove' is a bit different to what Disney had accustomed us so far; well, to tell it is a lot different to that, in fact, it could be said that this animated film is closer to the crazy and brilliant minds of Tex Avery and Chuck Jones than to the classic Disney animated features. Long gone are the musical numbers and the fairy tales, gone are the beautiful heroines and the malevolent villains; this little film is a breath of fresh air that takes Disney to the unexplored terrain of satire, parody and irreverent comedy. And the trip is well worth.The movie is about the young and arrogant Kuzco (David Spade), the Emperor of an Incan nation who enjoys his life of pleasure and comfort without caring too much for his people. Until one night, his second in command, Yzma (Eartha Kitt) betrays him and tries to poison him. Fortunately, the formula only converts Kuzco into a talking llama, however, with him in that form Yzma is able to usurp the power and gets rid of Kuzco. Now, the young Emperor will have to learn to live in a world harsher than what he knew and try to recover his throne.Well, while the plot outline sounds like another one of Disney's dramatic epic adventures, this movie has indeed a new groove. History says, that the film was actually going to go that way but director Mark Dindal and writers Chris Williams and David Reynolds took the story in a completely new direction, making a feature unlike any of the rest of Disney's classics. The film is packed with a very clever sense of humor that can be understood in many levels; it is not only mere slapstick, it goes beyond and as written above, has more in common with the Warner Bros. animations of Chuck Jones' days. The characters are perfectly well-designed and are definitely the soul of the film.However, the departure in content does not mean that the rest has changed. Despite all the apparent irreverence, the movie is suitable for kids and the morals and the message are still there, it's just that the package is now more entertaining than before. The animation technique still has Disney's top notch quality and the beautiful Inca-inspired designs give the film a fresh new look. The tone and mood of the story allows the film to explore many things that Disney had never tried and overall is a new modernization to their style.The cast is amazing and responsible of most of the success of the film. David Spade is brilliant as Kuzco and his domain of the character is total. It's hard to imagine someone else doing the voice. John Goodman plays Pacha, the only man who believes the talking llama is actually Kuzco, and his performance is very good. However, Eartha Kitt as Yzma and Patrick Warburton as her sidekick Kronk steal the show. If Spade and Goodman are brilliant then Kitt and Warburton are simply perfect.The film is definitely among the funniest films ever done by Disney and it is almost flawless. Even when it uses some pop culture references the film doesn't feel dated or silly thanks to the very subtle way that kind of humor is used. Still, the movie has been attacked for deviating from the classic Disney film and while the criticism has some good points (the film's simplicity for example), it still is a memorable and effective film that delivers lots of laughs and pure entertainment.'The Emperor's New Groove' may not be a landmark of animation such as 'Beauty and the Beast', but personally I think it represents a breath of fresh air for Disney and one of the most funny animated films ever done. While it is understandable that not everyone will catch the film's humor, this personal favorite is a very recommended film. 9/10",8,0,1,21 July 2006
Beowulf," A great retelling of a legend...
","Ever since the year of 1995 saw the release of Pixar's 'Toy Story, the first computer-animated feature film, a whole new way of creating animated movies was born, as while computers were already used in traditionally animated films, now they could be used to create animated feature length films. And just like traditional animation has developed several techniques (like Rotoscoping), 3D animation also developed its own styles, like photorealism, which attempts to mimic real life employing techniques such as motion capture. Director Robert Zemeckis has been working with this style for a while, with his first animated film being 2004's 'The Polar Express', which showed the potential of motion capture. His next animated feature was also based on the motion capture technique, but this time he used it to recreate England's oldest epic narration: the Norse legend of 'Beowulf'.Following closely the epic poem, the movie chronicles the story of how a monster named Grendel (Crispin Glover) terrorized the famous mead hall Heorot, slaughtering the people of danish King Hrothgar (Anthony Hokins) and bringing death to his lands. Hearing of the problems at Heorot, a Geatish hero named Beowulf (Ray Winstone) arrives to Hrothgar's mead hall with his men, claiming to be the world's greatest hero and the only one able to kill the monster. King Hrothgar decides to give Beowulf and his men a chance to prove their courage and allows them to battle Grendel, however, this fight will prove to be decisive in Beowulf's life, as not only he'll face a monster beyond his imagination, he'll also be forced to confront his inner demons when he meets Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), and to make things worse, he'll fall in love with the King's beautiful wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).As written above, 'Beowulf' follows the Old English poem quite faithfully, in the sense that it covers all the major battles and challenges that Beowulf faced. However, writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary use the poem's outline to add a back-story that ties all the poem's events, and at the same time explores the theme of the difference between man and myth in heroic tales. This adds an interesting complexity to the poem's characters (which are more archetypes than real persons), as while we do watch Beowulf as the mythic heroic warrior the poem talks about, we also see him as man whose greatest wish is to be remembered as a hero, and often falls in the temptation of exaggerating his feats. It's a take that many purists of the poem may dislike, but personally I found the script to be the strongest part of the film. The touch of sly humor is also another welcomed surprise in the screenplay.Director Robert Zemeckis makes a good job at making the Norse legend come to life again in animated form, recreating in a very detailed way the atmosphere of myth and magic that the epic tale conveys. While Gaiman and Avery's script takes some liberties with the original story, Zemeckis makes sure to keep that sense of thrill and adventure that has made 'Beowulf' to be a captivating story for over a thousand years. The technology employed in the film is definitely a big improvement over the work done in 'The Polar Express', and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call 'Beowulf' the best motion capture film ever done so far, however, Zemeckis' decision to use an extreme photorealism in the design (to the point that some actors look exactly as their real counterparts) isn't really as fortunate, as the closer the characters look to real life, the easier it gets to to spot flaws in them.Now, this is not really a problem of the cast, as while they aren't all excellent, for the most part they all make an efficient job in their roles. As the heroic and proud Beowulf, Ray Winstone is very good and makes a very human portrait of the mythic warrior, taking advantage of the fact that the script has humanized his character a bit. As his best friend Wiglaf, Brendan Gleeson shines despite the small size of his role, and he gets some of the best lines in the film. Anthony Hopkins is good as Hrothgar, but nothing really surprising, and the same could be said of Robin Wright Penn as Wealthow. However, Crispin Glover steals the show as Grendel, as he manages to deliver a poignant performance behind the his computer generated facade. Angelina Jolie is also very good in her role, although her accent wasn't really the most appropriate.With a very good cast, the best technology for computer animation and on top of that a solid script, one would think that 'Beowulf' could be a flawless example of animated art, but sadly, something just doesn't work completely. The problem, in my opinion, is that once again Zemeckis seems to be too enamored of his technology, and in his choice of making an extremely realist animated version, he has put the animation's flaws on display to everyone. What I mean is that this search for realism brings to the spotlight a major problem: the quality of the animation doesn't look constant, as while some characters do look amazingly like the actors that play them (Grendel's mother being the most notorious), others look extremely fake (Wiglaf and Hrothgar for example), so the contrast between them is glaringly obvious, and that's really bad.And this leads to another problem, or more precisely, a question: if Zemeckis wanted such an extreme photorealism in his film, why not use real actors to do it? But despite this, 'Beowulf' is not only an interesting experiment, if one gets over the idea that it's an animated film, one will find that behind the flashy graphics there's a powerful story, a story that has been thrilling our imagination for centuries. And still can do that and more.8/10",7,1,4,1 December 2007
Rear Window," The Master at his best.
","Brilliant. Legendary. Perfect. There are not enough adjectives to describe properly 'Rear Window'. Along with 'Vertigo' and 'North by Northwest' this is probably one of his best 3 movies.After his period in Warner Bros., where he directed masterpieces like 'Strangers on a Train' or 'Dial M For Murder', it seemed as if the master could not top what he had previously achieved. But he did. In fact, when Hitchcock directed 'Rear Window', his first movie at Paramount, he was beginning with the right foot what would become his most brilliant period.The well-known plot stars Hitchcock's favorite Jimmy Stewart as photographer L. B. Jeffries, who is almost caged in his apartment during his recovery from an accident he had while working. To kill the time, he becomes obsessed with what happens to his neighbors outside, to the point that he is convinced that one of them committed a murder. Grace Kelly plays his beautiful girlfriend, and Thelma Ritter plays his nurse.Hitchcock makes us parters in crime during Jeffreis voyeuristic adventures, as we are silent witness of the misfortunes of the neighborhood. Lisa, his girlfriend, has a difficult relationship with Jeffreis, there is definitely love there, but he is reluctant to include her in his life because he considers her 'too perfect'. Jeffreis voyeurism is probably, his escape to his problems as he prefers to watch the others.Technically the movie is brilliant. The camera is our eyes and it flows smoothly; and even when the movie takes place almost entirely in Jeffreis apartment, it never becomes tiresome or boring. This is also possible to the ingenious script and the brilliant performance of the three lead characters.Beautiful Grace Kelly is outstanding as the lovely girlfriend who turns into an adventurous spy as she gets interested in his boyfriend's new hobby. Jimmy Stewart gives once again his classic performance of the 'regular guy' that Hitchcock enjoyed so much; although in my opinion, is Thelma Ritter who gives the movie that charming quality, as her witty comments are delivered with that dark humor that Hitchcock loved so much.'Rear Window' is without any doubt, a perfect movie. Hitchcock has walked a long way, but all his previous work was practice when compared to the movies to come; his work would reach it's peak in the famous three: 'Vertigo', 'North by Northwest' and 'Psycho'. At this time, he is already considered a master.10/10. Masterpiece.",10,9,15,1 December 2005
300," Great entertainment!
","The Battle of Thermopylae is probably one of the most famous battles in ancient history, as it is often used as a prime example that the size of an army does not decide a battle. The reason for this lays in the fact that in Thermopylae, a small army of roughly 7000 Greek soldiers managed to defend themselves against the biggest army of its time, the Persians, which counted in its ranks more than 2,500,000 soldiers. While this is the main reason behind its importance, the battle has reached mythical status because it was also an example of courage, as when the battle seemed lost, most of the Greek soldiers retreated with the exception of 300 Spartans, who decided to put a tremendous last stand against their enemy. Their courage not only inspired 700 Thespians to join them, but also has inspired many notable works of art, most recently the 1962 movie 'The 300 Spartans' and Frank Miller's 1998 comic book '300'. Now, Miller's graphic novel is the basis of a new movie about Thermopylae: Zack Snyder's '300'.'300' can be summarized as the tale of the Battle of Thermopylae, as narrated by a Spartan soldier named Dilios (David Wenham) to his fellow Spartans. The story begins with a brief recounting of King Leonidas' (Gerard Butler) youth, and the events that made him the courageous leader he was. Years later, as a Spartan King, he receives the news that King Xerxes of Persia (Rodrigo Santoro) is on his way to Europe, and gives the chance to Sparta to join him in his quest for conquering the world. Prefering to keep his people free instead of paying tribute to Xerxes, Leonidas refuses, and prepares himself to defend his people. However, the Spartan council has been bought by Xerxes, and refuses to allow Leonidas to go to battle with the full Spartan army. Knowing that this will be his people's doom, Leonidas decides to take with him only 300 of his best soldiers and goes to battle the enormous Asian army alone.Adapted by Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon and Snyder himself, the movie is almost a word for word translation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, which as well was mainly based on Herodotus' writings on the subject. However, this doesn't mean that Miller's work (and the movie) is an accurate history lesson, as Miller's art takes enormous artistic liberties with the story, making the Battle of Thermopylae more mythic than realistic. While this of course may bother purists, it truly works in the context of the story (being after all the narration of a soldier), as an exaltation of the achievements of a country's army that of course demonizes its enemies. More an action film than a drama about war, the movie delivers good entertainment as the simple plot unfolds nicely despite some severe lack of character development.The film's highlight is definitely the visual look that director Zack Snyder uses for his movie. Using the same digital technique than Robert Rodriguez used for 'Sin City' (another of Frank Miller's comic books), Snyder brings Miller's graphic art to life with an extremely faithful care for details, almost putting every frame of the comic book to screen. This highly stylized visual look not only extends to digital backgrounds and special effects, Snyder's movie uses slow motion, great choreographs and a superb art direction to create an operatic narration that, just like in Miller's comic book, accentuates the mythic traits of the story, showing Spartans as super-soldiers and the Persian army as a hellish array of monsters. While completely inaccurate historically, it fits the story Snyder is trying to tell, although this extreme care for the style often makes him forget to care for the substance.Now, '300' is without a doubt a great technical achievement and visually, a wonderful film to watch, but it has some major problems deep inside, with the performances by the cast being the top of the iceberg. While Gerard Butler has received a lot of criticism as King Leonidas, he is truly one of the best in the film, and does a really good job with what he has to work. The best in the film is David Wenham, who truly adds a lot of mood and atmosphere to the movie with his narration. Sadly, not everyone in the cast was up to the challenge, and one wonders if they were chosen for the part thanks to their physical looks instead of acting talent. Lena Headey, Michael Fassbender and Tom Wisdom are really the main offenders, who make some of the worse parts of the script look even worst with their poor delivery.Personally, I think that the movie's most serious problem is the lack of characterization in the story, as Miller's simplification of the Battle made most of the characters look two dimensional at best. While it is true that Miller remained true to Herodotus and that some lines came straight from his work, it's hard to stop noticing how silly some dialogs are. True, it's an action film, but a little more of care while developing the script would had been enormously beneficial. Another problem of the film is definitely Snyder's complete focus on the visual aspect of his movie. Don't get me wrong, I know that a movie like '300' isn't supposed to be a powerful drama, however, Snyder's visuals tend to get pretty overwhelming, with an excessive use of slow motion that while effective at first, soon becomes a tiring gimmick.While I do consider '300' to be a flawed film, I must say that it's pointless to judge it in terms of historical accuracy because it never attempts to be accurate and dwells more in the realms of myth. Many have criticized this aspect (as well as Miller's obvious political subtexts) without noticing that '300' is not here to illustrate, but to provide good entertainment, and despite all its problems, it achieves that purpose against all odds. 7/10",7,15,30,30 March 2007
Sin City," Powerful & ruthless neo-noir style!
","'Sin City' are a well-known series of comic books written & illustrated by the legendary Frank Miller. Set in a fictitious rotten city named Basin, Miller tells several stories about life and death in the criminal world of Basin, lovely nicknamed 'Sin City'. Just like his masterpiece 'The Dark Knight Returns', Miller's style is harsh and violent, but not without a good dose of dark humor that fits perfectly the black and white film noir style of his stories.Like the comic books, 'Sin City' is a collection of neo-noir tales but what sets the movie apart from other comic-book adaptations, is the fact that director Robert Rodriguez used the books as storyboard and literally shot everything Frank Miller had conceived. As a result, the movie is a literal adaptation of the stories, without changes or additions, staying so true to Miller's writing and drawings that Rodriguez considered him basically another director.Three stories and a short-tale are told in this beautifully photographed movie. 'The Customer is Always Right' presents Josh Harnett in a short tale perfect to introduce us to the brutal world of Basin City; Bruce Willis plays honest cop John Hartigan chasing a sadistic pedophile in 'That Yellow Bastard', while Mickey Rourke gives the performance of his life as a tough criminal looking for vengeance in 'The Hard Good-Bye'. 'The Big Fat Kill' is the closing story narrating the desperate effort of Dwight (Clive Owen) to stop a war between gangs.Taking the conventions of film noir to the extreme, the duo of Rodriguez and Miller crafted a thrilling roller-coaster that never loses steam. Miller's dialogs and design are translated perfectly by Rodriguez and his camera-work. Rodriguez makes great use of digital effects to create a flashy black & white world that at times has some color. Just like Basin City's criminal life. However, despite the script and the camera-work, the movie would not be the same without the performance of the star-filled cast.Bruce Willis is superb as the aging John Hartigan, who tries to make justice in a town forgotten by God. Jessica Alba shares the screen with Willis and is irremediably overshadowed by his performance. Willis proves that he is more than an action film star. A lot has been said about Mickey Rourke's performance, so I'll just add that this is the role he will be remembered for, as he completely absorbs the character of Marv and makes him truly believable.Clive Owen as Dwight may not be perfect, but he still gives a worthy performance and carries his segment with grace. However, it is worth to notice Benicio Del Toro's acting, practically stealing every scene he appears. Michael Madsen, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer are only some of the many talents involved in this movie in supporting roles. Among them Devon Aoki shines as the mute Miho, projecting a strong presence without saying any word.At first sight 'Sin City' may look like another violent action fest, but this movie truly is more than that. With well developed stories, great acting by the cast and an original neo-noir visual style, this movie excels in every artistic department and is destined to be considered a classic in the future. Not only fans of Miller's comic books will enjoy it, it is definitely a must-see. 9/10",9,0,1,7 April 2006
Saboteur," Another step forward in the master's career
","Considered a lesser effort by many critics as it's probably not of the same magnitude of his other films; 'Saboteur' is another chance for practicing his favorite storyline: a regular guy is falsely accused of a crime.What he started with '39 Steps' and 'Young and Innocent' is improved here and is a step forward on the road that will lead him to the masterpiece 'North by Northwest'. With the ghost of the war haunting the country, 'Saboteur' is a film that reflects it's time and the ideology of the American society of those years.The script is not perfect, but even with the obvious plot holes it carries, we have a good development of the characters; and awesome scenes that while apparently do nothing for the story, are very important. The scene of the truck driver and the scene with the circus troupe are very significant, not only because of the witty dialog, but also because they set the tone of the movie, breaking the suspense for a while and giving the audience a chance to laugh at Hitchcock brilliant dark humor.The acting is for the most part OK. The bond between the main characters, Barry Kane(Robbert Cummings) and Pat Martin(beautiful Priscilla Lane), is carefully created and they have good chemistry. While Cummings certainly is not in the same league as the well-known Hitchcock's leads like Jimmy Stewart, he has a natural charm that helps him even when his acting is kind of wooden at times.The villains, played by Otto Kruger, Alex Baxter and Norman Loyd, are all superb in their respective roles, and one wonders why they receive very few screen time.One important thing is that the villains are never presented as evil. They are all charming men who have respectable lives, they are even funny & nice. Their only difference is that they use unorthodox methods to get what they want. This idea must had been haunting for the audience of the 40s, in the middle of the paranoia because of the war. As the marketing of the movie stated: anyone could be a 'Saboteur'.While it is probably one of the lesser efforts of Hitchcock, this movie paved the way for the classics that would come in the 50's. It will give you moments of pure joy and unforgettable scenes.8/10",8,2,5,30 November 2005
Happy Feet," One of the best animated films of 2006
","In animation, like in most arts, whenever a new technique is invented and succeeds, it doesn't really take too long until it becomes a widely used standard as everyone begins to explore it. That's exactly what happened to Computer Generated (CG) animation, to the point that now, 15 years after the release of 'Toy Story' (first animated feature made entirely with CG), this kind of animation is not as exciting or thrilling as before as most of the recent animated movies begin to look the same. Fortunately, 'Happy Feet', Warner Bros Studios attempt at CG animation plays definitely a whole different tune, as it uses CG imagery not only to animate its characters, but to create a vivid world attempting to use (or to mimic) elements of the art of cinematography. It may not be a huge step forward, but at least it's a step forward.'Happy Feet' is the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood), a young Emperor penguin with an uncanny natural ability for tap dancing, but unable to sing at all. The problem? Emperor penguins live in a society based on singing, where the use of the singing voice allows them to find friends and eventually a wife. As Mumble grows up, his inability to sing and his uncontrollable desire to dance make him almost a pariah, frowned upon by his friends, his father (Hugh Jackman) and the Elders of the community. Exiled, Mumble finds new friends in a different community of penguins (that sees dancing as another way to socialize), but also finds a mission: to discover who is causing the fish to disappear. To find it, he'll have to travel across Antarctica to find the mysterious 'Aliens' that seem to be behind all. Mainly written by director George Miller and John Collee (although with the collaboration of Warren Coleman and Judy Morris), 'Happy Feet' is an ambitious film that attempts to be funny and entertaining for the kids while at the same time being deep and intelligent enough for adults to enjoy as well. Not an easy task to accomplish, but for the most part Miller, Collee and their team of writers succeed almost flawlessly on their attempt. 'Happy Feet' can be seen basically as the classic tale of a young character and his trip to find his place in the world and his purpose in life, as well as the many problems and allies he finds during his odyssey. However, it is also tackles important topics such as tolerance, self confidence, and mainly the disaster we mankind are doing to out environment.While the script is certainly a bit contrived (mainly because its over ambitious goals), the direction of the movie is almost flawless. Almost 30 years after his breakthrough with the now legendary 'Mad Max', George Miller keeps being an effective and original director (despite the few number of movies he has directed) who doesn't seem afraid to try new and fresh things. Like a hybrid between his 'Babe: Pig in the City' and 'Mad Max 2', this movie is an adventure of epic proportions that while aimed to the kids, it's dark and meaningful, yet charming and very accessible at the same time. As I wrote at the beginning, 'Happy Feet''s most amazing feature is the simply perfect use of CG animation to create gorgeous settings and landscapes. It's use of lighting sources and textures is really breathtaking, and this is probably the closest CG can get to real life cinematography.The use of the voice is one of the main themes of the movie, and the work done by the cast is for the most part excellent. A big surprise are the work of Hugh Jackman (Mumble's dad) and Brittany Murphy (Gloria, Mumble's best friend), who deliver not only great acting performances, but also offer remarkable singing when necessary. Murphy really being outstanding, and probably the best voice of the film right after Robin Williams, who lends his voice to two important and very different characters. Elijah Wood as Mumble and Hugo Weaving as the Elder are OK, but nothing really amazing or unexpected of their talents. The only slight disappointment is probably Nicole Kidman, and not because her performance is bad, but mainly because she doesn't really show the amazing vocals of previous singing efforts ('Moulin Rouge!' for example).'Happy Feet' has received a lot of criticisms due to the no-so-subtle way it presents its message, to the point of being called cheap propaganda; however, I find that kind of criticism unnecessary and out of place, as 'Happy Feet' does offer a good chance to talk and discuss the movies's inherent message with the kids, who probably will find the movie visually attractive. True, 'Happy Feet' is a bit heavy handed on the handling of its message, but one can't deny that it still is a good attempt of telling an animated epic story with a morale behind. As it stands, 'Happy Feet' is a really good animated movie that not only will entertain, it will raise interesting questions and discussion with the younger ones, as it treats them intelligently.Since the beginning of time, fables and stories have been used to carry on messages, moral lessons, or parables; 'Happy Feet' continues this tradition as an excellent movie that is both entertaining and intelligent, and surely will deliver good fun if seen with an open mind. The breathtaking animation and the gorgeous landscapes are really a big plus that makes this movie one of the best animated films of 2006. 8/10",8,3,4,20 December 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," A really nice surprise...
","It seems like it was only yesterday when hip hop artist Will Smith decided to try his luck with acting on a sitcom named 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air', becoming a star thanks to his natural charm and talent for comedy. Soon after that, Smith proved to be a bankable movie star, thanks to a series of very successful action films, but it was only after his roles in 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' and in 'Ali', when Smith started to be considered a serious actor. More than 15 years after 'The Fresh Prince', Will Smith has finally proved that choosing acting over his singing career was a serious decision for him, and as he was not another singer playing himself. 'The Pursuit of Happiness', a movie also produced by himself, is another step in that progression towards more serious roles that he has taken recently; and like in Ali, this movie inspired by a real story puts Smith's talent to test, and to the surprise of many, he succeeds.'The Pursuit of Happiness' is very loosely inspired in the autobiographic book by Chris Gardner. In the movie, Gardner (played by Smith) is an independent salesman constantly struggling to sell a sophisticated, but little needed medical equipment. After investing all his savings in this business, he finds himself troubled for the lack of sales, and constantly struggling to pay the bills. The situation becomes unbearable for her wife Linda (Thandie Newton), so she decides to leave him alone with his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and move to New York. Without a stable job and with a son to take care for, Gardner decides to try for a stockbroker internship, hoping to be able to be selected to get a full time job. However, he won't see any money while the internship takes place, so he'll have to face homelessness. together with his little son he'll have to find the courage to keep pursuing 'Happiness'.While the movie is based on the Gardner's experiences written in his book, the script (by Steve Conrad) takes many liberties with the story. People expecting a true adaptation of the book will probably be disappointed by this, but Conrad's changes are really interesting; and while probably a bit too emotionally manipulative, they keep the spirit of Gardner's life story and most importantly: his inspiring message. Probably the biggest difference between the movie and the book is the change of Gardner's son Christopher from a baby to a 5 years old kid, and to make him his companion through the difficult lonely months of the internship. This was a very good addition in my opinion, as since in real life it was his son who inspired Chris to succeed, it made sense that in the movie their relationship was established in a more 'cinematic' way than in the book.Story says that director Gabriele Muccino was picked by producer Will Smith to direct this movie after watching his work in 'Ricordati Di me' (2003) and 'L' Ultimo Bacio' and it's not hard to discover why. As proved by his previous movies, Muccino has shown a taste for portraying stories of troubled men in his 30s struggling to overcome their own personal difficulties, as well as a talent for this kind of character driven dramas. Visually the movie really captures the atmosphere of the 80s (the movie is set in 1981), and has a somewhat gritty look that makes it feel very real, as if it was a documentary about this man's problems. However, Muccino's best trait is the way he directs his cast, as not only directs Will Smith's best performance so far, he also gets a remarkable (and very underrated) performance by Thandie Newton.Will Smith has walked a long path to become who he is now, and is in this movie when he really shows what he is worth. His performance as Chris Gardner is breathtaking, frighteningly realist, and one of the best male performances of the year. Surprisingly, it never feels like he is playing himself (as it often happens in his action movies), as really becomes this intelligent yet troubled man decided to follow his dream. Smith's enormous improvement is so notorious that it overshadows Thandie Newton's own amazing performance, but Newton's turn as Gardner's wife is also a performance worth to talk about. In a bold move, Newton takes away her image as a sexy woman and appears as an unsatisfied working woman completely tired of Gardner's failures and tired of her own life. Finally, the supporting cast is really excellent, specially the young Jaden Smith (Will's real son), who gives a very natural and charming performance as Gardner's 5 years old son Christopher.If the movie has any real problem is that it may appear to be too manipulative at times, specially to those aware of Gardner's real story as the changes seem to point out in that direction. However, I found those changes to be nice additions that actually made the movie to flow a bit more easily, and actually made the story not only inspiring, but also charming and funny at times. It's true that at first sight this movie looks like the typical 'underdog story', but what makes 'The Pursuit of Happiness' to stand out is the harsh realism the film has, specially in the scenes related to homelessness. It never romanticizes that sad situation and one can actually feel the real desolation of not having a place where to spend the night.This movie is not a masterpiece of film-making, but it's definitely the film where Will Smith delivers his best performance so far. Many have said that the film advocates the idea of money as the source of happiness, but I disagree; what this movie advocates is the idea of a proper home as a source of happiness. The sad fact that money is needed for that is actually the point of this movie. 8/10",8,0,1,15 February 2007
The Birds," Perfect Example of why Hitchcock is 'The Master of Suspense'
","This is one of Hitchcock's most well-known movies. Along with Psycho, it's the movie that most people identify with him. Many pages have been written about it and surely there will be more. I know that the superb technical aspects of the movie have been discussed a lot, so I'll try to focus on something I noticed yesterday when I watched it.It's scarier when there are no birds on screen. The tension, the silence, the uncertainty, the mystery. That's what suspense is about.I was amazed of how carefully Hitchcock builds the suspense in this movie. You watch the birds standing there, and they do not move, they are just waiting. Even when you think they are dumb something tells you they are thinking. They are analyzing your moves.This was possible with the aid of a top-notch screenplay, and great performances of the actors. This was probably the most difficult film for Hitchcock, specially for the technical aspects that were involved, but when you watch it, it really was worth the pain.The main plot is well-known: Melanie Daniels(Tippi Hedren),a young girl goes to Bodega Bay looking for Mitch Brenner(Rod Taylor),a handsome man she met in San Francisco, when suddenly, the birds start attacking humans by no reason. Pretty straight forward, and by this date very outdated, but Hitchcock adds his magic and the script spices this with the very complex relationships between the characters.The complex relationship between Mitch and his mother Lydia(played by Jessica Tandy), and the conflict that she has with Melanie is very interesting and brings back memories from Psycho. Also, Melanie's relationship with her own mother and the bond that she creates with Lydia and Mitch's 11 years old sister Cathy(Veronica Cartwright) is fascinating.The scene when the four of them are trapped inside the house with the birds waiting outside is classic; not only is, as I wrote above, a perfect example of the use of suspense, it is an awesome study of the characters and how their relation grows. I think that this particular movie was main inspiration for George A. Romero's claustrophobic climax in his landmark film 'Night of the Living Dead'(1968).The technical aspects may be the focus of many studies, but the characters deserve to be praised, even the support cast with a few lines develop a personality of their own. The restaurant scene is Hitchcock at his best with witty dialogs that are both humorous and creepy. Very good ensemble.Overall, this is an awesome movie, many reviewers have said it, I know. But I wanted to point that beyond the technical advances this experimental movie features, it is a perfect example of why Alfred Hitchcock is considered, 'The Master of Suspense'.9/10.

V for Vendetta," Surprisingly great!
","'V for Vendetta' was a comic book series (later published as a graphic novel) written by the now-legendary writer Alan Moore and penciled by David Lloyd. The complex sci-fi tale of the terrorist codenamed 'V' and his fight against the fascist British government in a near future setting was the first of many successes in Moore's career in the comic book industry.After many failed attempts to adapt Alan Moore's works to film (resulting in the writer's hatred to the idea and disowning of the final product), 'V for Vendetta' succeeds not only as a very good sci-fi film, but also as a good adaptation that, while deviating from the original storyline, it keeps the substance and keeps Moore's message consistent.The plot follows Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman in futuristic London, who one night is about to be raped and murdered by the corrupt secret police, but is saved by the mysterious masked vigilante who calls himself 'V' (Hugo Weaving). This way she becomes acquainted with the idealist terrorist and his personal crusade against the fascist government of the country, which will culminate with the destruction of the Houses of Parliament, mirroring Guy Fawkes' own attempt of blowing the building 400 years earlier on a 5th of November.Directed by James McTeigue and adapted by the Wachowski brothers (known for 'The Matrix' series), the film is a very good debut for McTeigue; who unlike the famous movies directed by his partners-in-crime, opts for a less flashy approach to action films and keeps the movie in tune with the original source novel. While the script done by the Wachowski moves away from the source novel making the film less complex (taking away most of the many complex subplots), the spirit of Moore's 'Vendetta' remains the same and 'V' remains a mysterious character right in the thin line between a villain and a hero.Hugo Weaving excels as 'V', giving the character the feeling of extreme idealism complete with the dramatic persona it needed. It is amazing the way his vocalization gives 'V' a personality; as a masked figure, the character demanded a lot of Weaving really could convey true emotions through the Guy Fawkes' mask. Natalie Portman is a great young actress, but while her expressive face and powerful presence do the job well, at times she sounds odd with a British accent that seems to come and go.Among a supporting cast of well-known British faces , Stephen Rea shines as police chief inspector Finch, who while trying to discover 'V''s past ends up discovering his own government secret past. His performance is remarkable and very underrated, he nailed the character perfectly and it's a shame that his character weren't used more prominently.And there is the movie's biggest flaw, the simplification of 'V for Vendetta' leaves out a lot of great subplots, and a longer runtime would be better. However, it is understandable that what it is in print not always can be translated to a 120 minute film (specially Moore's complex story lines), and the Wachowski brothers deserve credit for making the most of the storyline resulting in an interesting sci-fi movie with a powerful and still valid message. In this movie they prove that with a solid backbone such as Moore's novel, they can do very good stuff.James McTeigue shows promise as a director, and while his restrained style and focus on the plot rather than on the action may turn off hardcore action genre fans; the real fans of the comic book will be thankful. 'V for Vendetta' is easily, the best adaptation of Alan Moore's work to date. 8/10",8,0,2,22 March 2006
