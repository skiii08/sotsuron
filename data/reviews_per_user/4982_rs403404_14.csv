Blade Runner 2049," Run, even sprint, to see 'Blade Runner 2049'
","Denis VilleneuveThis is a name to look out for. Sicario and Enemy are two fascinating films. Further, in the last two years, he has managed to make two sci-fi classics.Think of films like The Day the Earth Stood Still, Planet of the Apes, 1954's Godzilla, and even Pixar's WALL-E, each in its own way held a mirror up to the human condition. In a similar vein, last year's Arrival delves into the potential breadth and depth of communication. Now we have Blade Runner 2049, a movie about what it means to be human. A movie smart enough to ask the questions and also smart enough to know these clear questions usually have no clear answers.In the year 2049, humanity has found a new form of slavery. The ability to make lifelike people except with enhanced strength. These people will be called replicants. Sometimes replicants will go rogue and that's when a blade runner is called in. Blade runners hunt rogue replicants.One of these blade runners is K (Ryan Gosling). He is tracking down replicants and finds himself diving down the rabbit hole left by the first movie. However, it's handled in a creative way giving you some surprise when you realize it's going that way. One of the characters is K's girlfriend who is a computer program. You might think that means she isn't real, but if she's not real does that mean the replicants aren't real either? She could be just as real as a replicant just without a body. These are just some of the ideas thrown out in the first act of the movie. Additionally, throughout this movie's over two and a half hour running time those ideas will not stop.I won't dive into the story anymore, but it is really secondary here. That's not to say it's not engaging, because it is incredibly so, but the movie revolves more around the questions of what is humanity and what does it means to be human. Therein lies the heart of this film.1982's Blade Runner created a fantastic world, but I found the story extraordinarily dull. Nevertheless, BR 2049 takes that world and explores it in all the logical ways it should. Ideas brought up in the original are fleshed out here. Further, as is often the case, asking the question is more powerful than answering it. This is what Ghost in the Shell missed earlier this year.Blade Runner 2049 is one of those rare sequels I enjoy better than the original. I have no problem calling it one of the best sequels ever made.The question of whether or not it will be more respected than the original in 35 years will be an interesting one to see answered.",10,1,10,14 October 2017
It," 'It' is really good
","Everyone was excited for this movie except me. People were sending me promotional art and movie trailers and, honestly, I didn't care. All the YouTube videos that popped up in my stream included an abundance of people talking about the trailers, I ignored them. Unless it was unavoidable, I didn't watch any of the trailers. Further, years ago, I tried to read the book, but found it unbearably redundant. The 1990 television movie left me unimpressed (outside of seeing a very young Seth Green and Tim Curry's Pennywise). I dreaded this movie and all the hype just heightened my dread. Everyone seemed pumped for this movie while I was pretty certain it would suck. Honestly, I was wrong. 2017's 'It' is a damn fine movie that is not only creepy, but actually did manage a genuine jump scare (I can't remember the last time that happened).It tells the story of a town in Maine (Stephen King's favorite state to inflict horrors upon) haunted by an evil clown named Pennywise (Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd). The clown feeds on fear thus targets children more than adults. It's never explained why, but it seems safe to assume that it's because children are easier to scare. Everyone is a target, but we mainly follow seven kids (Jaeden Lieberher, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer, & Wyatt Oleff). These seven are all misfits for one reason or another and all have had issues with the town bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton). They soon start having similar visions of a creepy clown. It's how they chose to deal with this revelation that drives the movie.This movie is a hard R and has some very graphic imagery and lots of bad languages frequently said by children. It's not a children's movie at all, yet I also think it's not bad to take your children if you think they could handle the scary stuff. There's a strong message here about how fear can only get you if you let it. The young cast (all of whom are very talented) help the message connect with a potentially younger audience. The idea that something as terrifying as Pennywise only has as much power over you as you give to it is not a bad message for anyone but especially children.If I'm forced to levy a complaint, it would be that the story, once again, gets redundant. That's it. Additionally, this movie proves that director Andy Muschietti is a name in horror worth keeping an eye on. Therefore, whether you're looking for a good scares or just a good movie, this is 'It'.",10,2,4,3 October 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Simple Fun and a Little More
","Kevin Feige has been doing a phenomenal job with the Marvel Cinematic Universe since the original 'Iron Man' over nine years ago. All the movies have at the very least been serviceable and sometimes he even manages a real homerun like the Captain America series, 'The Avengers', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', and the aforementioned 'Iron Man'. The only Marvel superhero franchise that hit the same quality levels as the MCU is the original Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. Specifically the first two, though the third does have its strengths.So, for years the very idea that Sony might loosen its grip on Marvel's most popular hero and allow him to enter the MCU seemed like a pipedream. In large part, the making of The Amazing Spider- Man franchise was a ploy to keep Marvel from regaining the Spider- Man rights back. Therefore, here we are. What masterpiece awaits us when the previous best superhero franchise joins forces with the current king of the superhero franchise? The answer is an entertaining teenage comedy with a superhero twist. It's not a great work of art by any means, but it was a fun experience. It does do two vital components: 1) it actually gives us a true to spirit version of Peter Parker, something missing in the Amazing series, and 2) it allows Michael Keaton to give us a mesmerizingly hammed up villain performance. Previous versions of the Vulture were boring, yet here he was probably the best part of the movie. This movie goes against the typical MCU mold of one-dimensional antagonist and gives us a compelling villain.'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is a superhero coming of age movie, reminiscent of John Hughes films from the 80s (though not as good as the best of those--then again what is?). Spider-Man is constantly forced to choose between being a kid and being a superhero. Being a superhero has a cost all its own since his exploits are filled with growing pains. Practically every Spider-Man adventure ends in either failure or clumsy victory. This is honestly the movie that Sony seemed to try (and fail) at with 'The Amazing Spider-Man'.This is the best Spider-Man movie since 'Spider-Man 2'; however, when you look at the competition, that's an amazingly low bar to clear. As far as MCU movies in general, this is a middling effort. Honestly, probably not even quite as good as 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'. However, middling amongst the MCU is still fairly impressive overall. If you want to see a return to the Raimi era of Spider-Man, you'll be disappointed. But, if you're just looking for a fun movie, you'll leave contented.",8,2,26,29 July 2017
Baby Driver," Style Over Substance
","Style over substance. It's a term thrown around when defending a film that has artistic merit in visuals but lack a strong story. The films of Michael Bay and Zack Snyder frequently get this defense. The reason why that defense fails is because those movies are actually style with no substance. Baby Driver is an example of a style over substance movie.I can literally break down the entire plot for you in this review without fear of spoiling the movie. A young man (Ansel Elgort) finds himself indebted to a criminal (Kevin Spacey) and has to commit crimes to pay off the debt. Eventually he's clear but he quickly finds that getting out from under the criminal's control isn't that easy. Of course, the young man meets and falls for a girl (Lily James) who reciprocates and becomes involved in the chaos. Not only did I not spoil anything, it's the same plot as about fifty other movies.That's where the style comes into play. Director Edgar Wright fills this world with characters that are more than just one-dimensional plot contrivances. The young man, called Baby, listens to music almost none-stop to drown out a hum in his hearing he got as a child. That music is the film's soundtrack and frequently leads to scenes playing out like music videos but it always feels natural. Flowing from story to music video seamlessly. That's style.Added to this, is the fact that Wright also throws a lot of curveballs into the standard plot of the movie including some skillful bait and switch with the person who ends up as Baby's main antagonist. The cast all embody their characters. Elgort holds his own, but the supporting cast still shine. And when that support includes Spacey, Jon Hamm, Jon Bernthal, and Jamie Foxx it's easy to see why.Despite this impressive star power bringing their sizable skills to play, the real talent that shines here is Edgar Wright's sharp script and clever direction. I wonder how much of this was brought over from his work on Ant-Man. I do find it interesting his first film after leaving a superhero heist film is a heist film.And even though the film's origin may be an interesting tale, it ends up being a moot point. All the matters is the final product, and the final product is something really special that stands with some of Wright's best work (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and Hot Fuzz). That is exceptionally fine company with which to stand.",10,2,3,29 July 2017
Dunkirk," Good but Not Great
","Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be one of the most talented filmmakers of his generation. However, like every filmmaker he has his quirks. 'Dunkirk' is the first time Nolan has attempted a movie with real history behind it. It's rare to get a World War II movie that takes place before the US enters the war. Yet, somehow his quirks shined through here louder than ever before.Nolan's war epic is filled with memorable characters played by actors who are regulars to his films like Tom Hardy as an air force pilot, Michael Caine in an uncredited voice cameo, and Cillian Murphy as a shellshocked soldier. The film keeps the names of characters fairly vague, perhaps because many of the characters don't have an exact real world counterpart. Rather each character is created from the experiences of real life people, which is a skilled technique to maintain the integrity of events while limiting the actual characters such that the movie doesn't feel bloated.We also get a completely brilliant score by Hans Zimmer who once again knocks it out of the park. He is easily one of the best composers for movies ever. Zimmer always seems to know the exact note to hit to get you emotionally invested.However, not every trait of Nolan's can be considered good. Sometimes he can make some of his weaknesses work to his advantage. Although I like good dialogue as much as the next person, he has a tendency to rely entirely too much on it to rather that using visuals. This worked in a film like 'Inception' where he needed to convey a set of rules in a clear, concise way to the audience. However, it didn't work as well in The Dark Knight movies. And it definitely doesn't work in 'Dunkirk'And while Nolan has become a much better action director since 'Batman Begins', his action scenes still have little to no lasting impact. 'Dunkirk''s action all lies within this 'meh' area. You can get invested in the characters and that causes you to care what happens, but the actual action just seem to happen then ends with little or no fanfare.Finally, Nolan seems to have tried some sort of artistic editing with this film. Time jumps occur inexplicably that break up the narrative and jolt the audience out of the experience. The movie is for the most part very linear in it's narrative which makes the random time jumps all the more baffling.Still, this is a good movie. More on par with 'Interstellar' as far as total quality than something like 'Inception'. It's not one of Nolan's best, but even a weak Nolan film is better than what most studios put out by a wide margin.",8,1,5,29 July 2017
Get Out," 'Get Out' Gets It
","Is it possible for a movie to be both stupid and smart? both blunt and subtle? Generally speaking, 'no'. But in the case of a film like 'Get Out', the answer is very much 'yes'. 'Get Out' is a movie of contradictions. As opposed to being a weakness, the contradictions are completely the point and the movie radiates with them.This is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele. Better known as the second half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, a duo that has forayed into the movies since the end of their series. Last year it was the comedy 'Keanu' and now we have Peele by himself behind the camera. For a directorial debut, he shows a real eye for using the camera as an integral aspect of storytelling. Also, he seems to inherently understand what makes good horror work: it's not necessarily what you see that scares you, but what lurks just out of sight.Further, if this movie was just a skillfully directed horror piece that would be impressive enough, but hung within this horror framework are instances when it also manages to be an entertaining comedy. Without giving anything away, there are two moments of spectacularly jarring musical choices that should jolt the audience out of the movie. Nevertheless, due to the way that the movie is woven together, they become humorous moments without breaking any of the tension.If all you want is a horror movie that avoids the worst clichés of the genre (e.g. annoying characters doing truly stupid things) then you should enjoy yourself just fine. However, there is so much more to uncover within this movie.You might be able to guess from the ads that racism plays a pivotal role in this movie. Yet, no one in this movie gives the appearance of being a traditional racist. The movie is much to savvy to depict stereotypical racism. Instead, it delves into far more insidious forms of racism and, by doing so, many of the same story elements could be used to examine any form of prejudice.On closer inspection, this film exceeds the expectations of a comedic horror movie wherein brain transplant surgery is a real thing. Just as with prejudice, if you take this film at face value, then you've missed the subtle undertones that give life depth. Peele retells a moral told many times before, yet somehow manages to make it feel fresh and interesting.Peele's directing career is off to a very strong start. I'm exciting to see what he makes next.",8,9,18,7 March 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," This Pirate Ship Sunk Long Ago
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' was a surprise. Disney had been trying ride-based movies for a few years and they were all awful. Then suddenly here came one that was fun and featured a character that would for better or worse define the rest of Johnny Depp's career. The movie was a critical and financial hit.Unfortunately 14 years and 4 sequels later, all the charm and sense of adventure that made the original so much fun is nothing more than a faded memory. Part of the problem is the popularity of Jack Sparrow (Depp). Each movie exposes some untold backstory in order to make him relevant to the plot. Unfortunately, Captain Jack Sparrow is just overblown comic relief. Yet, his past seems to constantly dig up enemies who are after him. Now instead of seeing humor in Sparrow's role in the story, I just wonder why so many trust this loose cannon with such pivotal items.'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' is a decently put together film. The effects are fantastic which is par for the course with this franchise. The problems here lie with the characters and the story. Since Jack is too goofy, other characters have to drive the plot. This time those characters are Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites), son of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, who is a character about as engaging as paint drying. The other key character is Carina Smyth (played wonderfully by Kaya Scodelario). These two enlist Jack Sparrow as they search for the Trident of Poseidon. The villain this time is Captain Salazer played by Javier Bardem. Remember how he intimated James Bond in Skyfall and terrified everyone he crossed paths with in No Country for Old Men. Well get ready to hear him gurgle unintelligible lines. If the filmmakers went out of there way to make Bardem suck as a villain, they succeeded. Further, Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa is tacked on to the story and at the end they attempt to give him a reason to be there meant presumably to maximize some emotional impact that fails miserably. Part of the problem with this entire series is that it fails to do any character development and in its place inserts so many plot points such that if the audience wishes to follow the story properly they should keep notes. But, who wants to keep notes on characters who fail to evolve in any way. By way of contrast, The Fast and the Furious characters appear deep, intricate, and thoughtful. In conclusion, this pirate ship sunk long ago.",4,10,16,10 June 2017
Logan," 'Logan' Has Claws and Not Much Else
","Nearly 17 years ago, 'X-Men' debuted in theaters. While it wasn't the best reviewed movie ever by any stretch of the imagination, it did show that the well-known Marvel comic book properties could earn solid box office numbers. Since then, the likes of 'Spider-Man 2', 'The Dark Knight', and 'The Avengers' have evolved the genre from something of interest to only comic book fans to the general public. We've had 3 Spider-Mans, 2 Batmans, 2 Supermans, and 3 Hulks on the big screen. Despite all that change, the X-Men universe has remained somewhat intact. Sure, they've had cast changes but only to show younger versions of characters. Meanwhile, the older cast still manages to pop-up occasionally. The closest thing to a reboot was merely a soft reboot that didn't involve any cast changes.A large part of this could be attributed to the brilliant casting of the first 'X-Men' film. Individually, Patrick Stewart's Professor X and Ian McKellan's Magneto created the kind of spot-on portrayals a comic fan dreams of. But even they pale in comparison to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. The 6'3' Australian was a last minute replacement to play the 5'3' Canadian character. To say he wasn't comic book accurate would be an understatement. But what he managed to do was improve on the comic book character by bringing it humanity while staying true to the original gruffness of its roots.Hugh Jackman has played Wolverine in more movies than any other actor playing a superhero. Jackman has appeared as Wolverine in 9 movies and had a starring role in 7 of those. 'Logan', by all accounts, is his, and likely Stewart's, swan song to the X-Men universe. It's bittersweet in two ways: 1) because it's sad to see these actors leave iconic roles that they've been at for so long, and 2) because while it's a serviceable outro, it's not nearly as strong as these characters/actors deserve.Further, this movie seems to ignore both 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' and 'X-Men: Apocalypse' in the continuity. I will happily admit this movie is a fair bit better than those, nevertheless, it's important to follow the rules previously set up in the universe. Especially when within the post-credits scene in 'X-Men: Apocalypse' there was a teaser for Logan. To discover that this tease went nowhere was disappointing at best. Particularly since it indicated a classic X- Men villain would make an appearance, when in reality the villains of this movie are essentially canon fodder to be shredded by Logan and company. Eventually, near the end of act 2, a villain appears that could actually be a threat to the team.The 'Logan' movie has a solid setup. It's the not too distant future (kudos to the makeup department for convincingly adding a couple of decades to Stewart and Jackman) and mutants are dying out. No new mutants has been born for 25 years and those that are left are seeing their powers diminish in various ways. As a swan song, this is perfect. With most of the heroes gone and forgotten, the heroes that remain have to prove they might still be able to do some good in the world.Unfortunately, acts 2 and 3 become little more than a road trip movie with Logan, Xavier, and a young girl named Laura (played very well by Dafne Keen), as they travel from Mexico to North Dakota. There are various stops along the way that usually result in the group being discovered by the bad guys and having the slash their way out. Throughout the trip it's impossible for the audience to know how far they've gone. Have they gone 50, 100, 1000 miles? As it is, the audience has no way to judge if the journey is almost done or just beginning.I'm not sure this movie intends to have a moral, but if it did it almost certainly would be, 'no good deed goes unpunished'. Of course, it might also be 'no bad deed goes unpunished'. Perhaps, the moral is simply 'no deed goes unpunished'. It does seem as though Wolverine could've prevented a lot of death by simply minding his own business. It honestly gets to the point where death is so prevalent in this movie, it makes it very hard to develop an attachment to any character. Why would the audience become invested in characters when the movie is obviously willing to kill anyone at anytime?However, even though this movie was a disappointment, I can't be too harsh on it. If nothing else, seeing Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart in these roles one last time is worth the price of admission. These are two actors who I doubt could give a bad performance if they tried. The story, even with it's failings, is strong enough not to diminish their performances. Additionally, James Mangold's direction is solid enough although the pacing of the movie can get fairly muddy in act 2.I probably could've been more forgiving of the errors within the movie if they had given some thought to developing the relationship between Wolverine and Laura. What should have been the beating heart of this movie is all but overlooked. Still, as far as outros go, this is a solid one. Further, it's great to see Wolverine exit in an explosion of gore that a character with claws would almost certainly manage.It's sad to see an end to this chapter in comic book movies, but, on the other hand, we still have Deadpool.",8,2,5,7 March 2017
Beauty and the Beast," 'Beauty and the Beast': Another Pointless Remake
","There's really one key question you have to ask yourself when remaking a classic: how are you making this different than before? how are you contributing to the mythos of this story? At best, it's unwise to create a remake without an original vision; it will surely suffer when compared to the original. Remember Gus Van Sant's misguided shot-for-shot remake of 'Psycho'?2017's 'Beauty and the Beast' isn't nearly as ill-advised, but it's in the same vain. Disney has been remaking their animated classics into live action films over the past few years, primarily due to the success of 2010's 'Alice in Wonderland'. However, with the exception of Jon Favreau's spectacular 'The Jungle Book', the whole endeavor has been grossly underwhelming. Sadly, 'Beauty and the Beast' is not an exception.That's not to say the movie is bad per se. It's well made with some incredibly talented actors in the mix (Kevin Kline, Ewan Mcgregor, Stanley Tucci, Emma Thompson, and Ian Mckellan all in supporting roles) solidly mixing drama with gentle goofiness. The animation on Beast is iffy, but in general, the computer effects are well done. The movie is overlong, but the pacing balances out this issue for the most part. Honestly, in a vacuum, this would be a very good movie.However, this movie doesn't exist in the vacuum. The 1991 animated classic is essentially the same movie. Sure, this version includes some more backstory for the supporting cast, but it's nothing that's necessary. Some of the changes are good and some are bad. In the end, the changes are a wash to the movie's overall quality.As for the stuff they didn't change, it's near identical to the original. It's to the point where they almost certainly just cut and pasted pages of 1991's script into this movie. As an example of the changes, there's a key point in this movie where things play out as they did in 1991, however, some details are altered such that the end product doesn't make sense.All the classic songs make a return in decent covers by the new cast. However, they also add new songs. If you've just emerged from a cave after 30 years, there's an easy way to tell which are the classic songs and which are new: the classic songs are the good ones.Fact is, while this is a solid movie on it's own, it's impossible to recommend when in-essence this movie already exists. If you're a huge Beauty and the Beast fan and await with bated-breath any incarnation of this story, then wait no more, you'll probably have fun with this. The rest of us should save our money and rent the 1991 movie.",6,4,10,20 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A Lot of Fun, but Falls Short of the Original
","'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is another entry in a continuing trend of disappointing superhero movies. I'm starting to feel like a scratched record. 'Doctor Strange' was a very good movie, but disappointing in how it missed its inherent potential. 'Logan' was a very good movie, but disappointing how it missed its inherent potential. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is very good but...you catch my drift.Each movie takes a different path to accomplish its misfire. 'Doctor Strange' never went as dark as it should have. 'Logan' perhaps went too dark and failed to develop the core relationship of the film. 'Guardians Vol. 2' is filled with a cast of mesmerizing returning characters, but this time in an inconsistent story that has a tendency to lurch around with either too little or too much buildup.The most prominent story problem is the lack of a coherent antagonist for the first half of the film. The closest we get is a Ravenger named Taserface whose name is enough to throw Rocket into fits of laughter making him seem less antagonist and more comic relief.That's not to say this film lack a good villain. On the contrary, Ronan from Guardians Vol. 1 pales in comparison (making it one of the very few aspects wherein Vol. 2 tops Vol. 1). It's only that the movie takes it's own sweet time establishing the villain, which leaves the audience wondering what are the Guardians guarding. It's cumbersome to invest in a movie with little to no stakes. Eventually, when all is revealed, the movie almost seems to lunge over the finish line like a runner trying to come from behind.Despite all this, the movie is still a solid enough piece of entertainment, largely due to the interpersonal chemistry between the heroes. They are the reason this film works. It's not even that the story is bad. More that the story spends too much time establishing itself and not nearly enough letting the audience appreciate where the story has gone.If you're a fan of the original movie, then you're pretty much guaranteed an enjoyable experience. The returning cast is just as delightfully watchable as they were before. The new cast are all welcome additions, even Sylvester Stallone whose appearance might only be foreshadowing of a spin off or sequel. Music is employed with the same effervescence as the Vol. 1 (Groot dancing to ELO's 'Mr. Blue Sky' stands out). James Gunn's direction of action is as entertaining as ever. In general, this movie is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, just not as much fun as the original.",8,4,6,11 May 2017
American Made," An enjoyable Cruise
","Cruise has a checkered history, with stories of: his bizarre marriage arrangements, his famous Oprah appearance, and, of course, his adherence to Scientology. Originally, Cruise was liked by the public, then fell out of the public's good graces, and now, due to his skill as an actor, is conditionally liked again. It seems only appropriate that Cruise could make you root for someone as dubious as Barry Seal.'American Made' tells the true story of Seal, a TWA pilot who got an offer to work from Schafer (Domhnall Gleeson) for the CIA. He soon starts taking surveillance photos overseas when he stumbles onto a drug cartel. A little talk of money and he becomes a drug smuggler. When CIA learns of this, they decide to enlist him to transport guns to the contras. Pretty soon Seal has a thriving drug smuggling and gun running business.Seal is very much the protagonist, but fails as a good guy. However, the movie doesn't pass any judgment on his actions, but instead tells the story of a man trying to provide for his family while his life spirals out of control. That's where Cruise comes into play. You may not like what Barry is doing. You may find his actions repugnant. But with Cruise in the role, and despite your better judgment, you sympathize with the character.Like many movies based on a true story, facts are certainly jumbled up for effect. The director, Doug Liman, uses the narrative not to be critical of Barry Seal, but to be critical of the the CIA and the Reagan administration, which makes sense, since they were calling the shots. If Seal didn't takes the job, they would have found someone else and we'd have a movie about that guy.This is all background however. Liman adds a lot of flair to the movie to create the time period and to make it less jarring when we cut to the copious amount of stock footage used in this movie. But this is very much a Tom Cruise vehicle. Despite your better judgment, you spend the movie cheering for his character.'American Made' does drag as Barry gets his business going and things run as expected for a while, but, fortunately, it's short. Overall, the movie was an interesting character study of a man with no real moral compass doing whatever he can to make money. Sadly, this film demonstrates that one can go far in this world if you don't allow issues such as laws and ethics distract you. Barry Seal seems like abysmal person, but I did enjoy spending two hours with him.",8,1,4,3 October 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Kong Roars in Skull Island
","King Kong is one of those movies that periodically gets remade. The same theme is central to every King Kong film: beauty tames the savage beast. However, that aspect is just subtext in this movie; the main story and themes differ completely from previous variations. The reason for this change is because 'Kong: Skull Island' is not another King Kong remake at all. It's a completely different beast that just happens to have King Kong in it (although a Kong that is far larger than your average iteration).Due to this freedom, 'Kong: Skull Island' pursues far more relevant themes than previous Kong movies. The film takes place at the end of the Vietnam war and takes full advantage of that traumatizing time. Within this vehicle, there's subtext on nation building that's fascinating, but the core ideas that this movie explores are the role of the warrior when there is no war, particularly, when they come home defeated. For the most part, the majority are just happy to go home to their families, but far more disturbingly is the soldier looking for the next war.Into this vacuum steps Samuel L Jackson's Preston Packard. In a movie with lots of solid acting, Jackson standouts. He is a man driven by rage, however, he never acts unreasonably. It's easy to see why he would command a unit and why men follow him. Focused and determined, he pursues his next victory at any cost. At face value, most of his ideas appear insane, but when he speaks his ideas and motivations never seem entirely outlandish. Through this, the movie explores the ideas of what war does to its warriors.Unabashedly, the movie never neglects the concept that big monsters giving each other a thrashing is awesome. Despite the serious themes this movie explores, it never forgets that it's just a fun monster versus monster beat-em-up B movie. Fortunately, unlike the American 'Godzilla' from a couple of years ago, the audience experiences as much action as it could handle. Further, the effects are simply spectacular. None of 'The Great Wall''s green dogs here, more comparable would be the effects from last year's 'The Jungle Book'. Most the creatures and especially Kong himself look very real.Sure, there are times where I feel like editing skipped minor story points occasionally making the audience wonder how some characters got from point A to point D, but this is an infrequent occurrence. Also, outside of Preston Packard and Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly is the other big standout in the cast) all the characters are rather underdeveloped. Still all in all, 'Kong: Skull Island' is a film far better than it has any right to be.",8,3,6,13 March 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman is Wonderful
","Thank you DC and Warner Bros. for finally getting the message. Thank you for finally figuring out that the reason Marvel Studios movies work isn't because they have a fun soundtrack or because they do a bunch of cameos, but because they actually make decent movies that are true to the spirit of their heroes. Thank you for finally making a live- action Wonder Woman movie. And last, but certainly not least, thank you for making a female led superhero movie that doesn't suck.As you might've been able to guess, 'Wonder Woman' is an astonishingly good movie. After the disasters of 'Batman v Superman' and 'Suicide Squad', it seemed like the studio had no idea how to run a successful superhero franchise. This was particularly sad since Warner Bros. essentially invented the genre with 1978's 'Superman'. However, 'Wonder Woman' dodged all the problems that made 'Batman v Superman' and 'Suicide Squad' so abysmally bad.'Wonder Woman' gives us a true to comic book version of the character without any shame. It's dark sure, but it also has levity. It embraces Greek mythologies and a hidden island of warrior women completely. It even manages to mix two of her origins into the movie seamlessly.Director Patty Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Feinberg must be given the most credit. Many might be tempted to handle the silly aspects of Wonder Woman's story with a wink to the audience. But instead they treat it with all the gravity needed to give the world a Wonder Woman that is both strong and human. Part of that also comes down to the performance of Gal Gadot. Although sometimes her line delivery leaves a bit to be desired, she carries herself as a hero. The whole cast here should be commended. Chris Pine's Steve Trevor is a good man in a world where sometimes good men must make hard decisions. David Thewlis and Robin Wright also provide strong roles that essentially just push the plot forward, but it feels natural here.I actually find myself wondering if 'Wonder Woman' is actually as good as I thought or if my expectations for the DCEU are so rock bottom that the movie appears all that much better when compared to other entrants. No matter what, the fact that Wonder Woman finally presents a strong female superhero and is, at the very least, a decent movie makes it worthy to check out.The question we now have to ask, is Wonder Woman the course correction the DCEU desperately needed, or was it just a fluke? With Justice League is just around the corner, we'll know the answer soon.",8,5,13,10 June 2017
Alien: Covenant," An Enjoyable Alien Encounter
","Creation through destruction is the theme to 'Alien: Covenant'. The eighth Alien movie and almost certainly the best the franchise has offered since James Cameron's 'Aliens' in 1986. Sadly, that's not to say 'Alien: Covenant' is anywhere nearly as good as the first two entries in the series; it's just better than anything that's come since. In other words, this is not a huge accomplishment. The franchise has plummeted from the coma inducing boredom of 'Alien 3' all the way to the complete crap-pile called 'Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'. The movie series has been so horrendous that the severely flawed 'Prometheus' felt like a huge leap in the right direction.That's not to say I hate 'Prometheus'. It's a wonderfully directed, beautifully shot movie with incredibly stupid story elements. 'Alien: Covenant' drops the numerous dumb story elements from 'Prometheus' and replaces them with one of the most obviously telegraphed twist endings ever. I'm not going to reveal it, but if you don't see it coming, then you're not paying attention.With the exception of that twist, this is an intense well constructed movie that does a great job of bridging 'Prometheus' with the rest of the franchise.The cast this time around is solid providing us with characters we can become invested in rather than the caricatures in the previous film. Katherine Waterston and Danny McBride standout with Michael Fassbender again stealing the show reprising his role as David and also playing a new character, Walter.The atmosphere of this film manages to be both beautiful and horrifying and include some majestic landscapes and a Pompeii inspired graveyard. All of which is used to great effect. The landscapes provide contrast to the horrors hidden within, while the graveyard is a place of safety or is it?The beauty of the scenery all plays into the previously mentioned theme, I.e. in order to create, you must destroy. The creation of this paradise is a source of devastation and destruction. It's quite frankly a wonderful movie weighed down by the choice to include such an obvious twist. This movie could've been in the same league as the first two entries in the series. Unfortunately with its current ending, it's like listening to the John Lennon part of Double Fantasy, then suddenly being assaulted by the Yoko Ono portion. It was just too good; they just had to crap it up.Still, this movie is visually stunning and incredibly intense until then. I have to recommend it. Just prepare yourself for a disappointing ending to this exciting ride.",8,2,6,10 June 2017
