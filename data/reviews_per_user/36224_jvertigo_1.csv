Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Enjoy The Phantom Menace for Today, not 1977.
","I thought that Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace was a wonderful movie.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't perfect because of some small flaws but, it certainly is not as bad as several overly critical critics would have you think.  I mean does anyone remember how several critics originally hated 'A New Hope' but, in recent years had to go back on their original comments and say that it really was a good film?  And besides, it's just entertainment.  It is also a piece of art but, we're not discussing nuclear winter or the bleak future of mankind and the earth here so lighten up and enjoy the film.  Take your kids, be a kid, have some popcorn, clap, cheer, yell, remember how it was to see 'A New Hope' back in 1977 when you were a child (or Younger adult), and don't compare 'The Phantom Menace' to 'ANH' because that was 1977 and this is 1999.  :)",8,0,0,10 June 1999
