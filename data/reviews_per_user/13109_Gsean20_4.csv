Skyfall," An Incredible Film
","Skyfall, the latest 007 film, is an incredible film and a nonstop thrill ride. It arrives on 50 years after, Connery first entered as Bond in Doctor No. It is a fantastic film, gifted with a superb plot, exciting action, and phenomenal acting. Its theme, of loyal and betrayal are intense and helped created a film which is epic in scope, but one that feels intensely personal.The opening sequence in exotic Istanbul sets the tone for the film. In it Bond and Eve, a fellow MI6 agent, pursue a target who has stolen a encrypted flash drive containing information vital to MI6 and western intelligence in general. The exciting chase takes place on the streets of Istanbul, along with the roofs. It is brilliantly choreographed as Bond transitions from car, to motorcycle, and finishes in a life or death struggle atop a moving train. In the end disaster occurs. M orders Eve to take a risky shot, which results in Bond being shot and falling 50 feet from a bridge into deep water to a presumed death. The shot of Bond falling is an intense image, even if you have seen the trailer, it is shocking and sets the tone for the rest of the film.The titles sequence is another masterfully made part of the film. It is filled with omens an images of death such as skulls, grave, and deadly weapons. A sequence in a hall of mirrors where Bond shoots his reflection and one where Bond shoots his shadow are brilliant and artful. Throughout the sequence, Adele's theme song leaves us sitting on the edge of our seat. It is one of the few title sequences I am sure I will watch all the way through when Skyfall makes its way to DVD.The plot of the film is excellent. MI6 falls under attack from a cyber terrorist, Rauol Silva, who is a figure from M's past. M's leadership of the agency is called into question just as Silva executes a daring plot, using his computer skills to set off a Bond in the MI6 headquarters. One of the films most powerful images is M standing solemnly in a room filled with coffins covered with Union Jacks. Bond returns to service out of loyalty to M, but the Bond that comes back is different from the one who left. No longer clean shave, Bond's hands shake when he fires a gun, and he struggles physically and mentally to recover from the experiences he has been through. Though she is not sure of Bond's readiness, M sends her to find Silva. The relationship between M and Bond is deeper that ever before as secrets from her past come back to haunt her and MI6. The mission is a dangerous one, with twists and turns a plenty, but it grabs hold of you and never lets go.The acting in this film is incredible. Daniel Craig owns the screen as Bond. He shows us the strengths and weakness of a complex character. He also has great chemistry with the other actors and he brings more banter to the part than in his other two outings. Judi Dench is magnificent as M. Though she has always been formidable in the role, she raises the bar again. She displays the toughness of a boss, willing to sacrifice her agents to achieve her goals, yet she also shows the vulnerability of a character whose time maybe coming to end. No one shines brighter in Skyfall than Javier Bardem who plays the villain with a giddy flamboyance but never seems ridiculous. Looking truly unique with his blonde hairdo, Bardem creates a complex villain, one who is sure to take his place among the all time bond greats. His entrance in the film, in which he strides towards a tied up Bond while relating a story about rats eating each other, is mesmerizing. He brings back suave to the Bond villain, which Quantum sorely lacked. Yet he is also able to appear creepy and darkly menacing. He is a mix of new villains and old. He is a cyber terrorist yet he is ruthless and willing to pull the trigger, as he brutally shows Bond. The rest of the supporting cast is incredible.The complex themes of loyalty and betrayal helped make the film relevant and powerful. In addition, Mendes asks the bold question of whether M and Bond are relevant any longer. Yet the incredible story and intense action prove that Bond isn't going anywhere and that perhaps his new adventures can match his old ones. Well done 007. Nobody does it better.",10,6,17,16 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," A fantastic film
","J.J. Abrams Star Trek debut was a huge success and making a film of equal quality for the sequel is a task. But Abrams and company have brilliantly risen to the occasion with a intense, fun, and thrilling film with a story that brings to mind a post 9/11 atmosphere. Chris Pine, Zach Quinto and the rest of the cast are outstanding, breathing even more life into the already iconic characters they portray. Benedict Cumberbatch burns up the screen as the much debated villain, definitely a star making turn for the great British actor. The story is good, allowing the characters to develop and grow, and the story has a very deep emotional core. The film is in my opinion a little bit action heavy, but the sequences are brilliantly well done. Special effects are outstanding, matching the atmosphere that the story and actors set up. Don't miss this one.",9,7,13,19 May 2013
Drive," An excellent film, extremely well made, and filled with great performances . It is a unique and great movie experience. A must see
","Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is a movie the likes of which I have never seen before. It has a unique style that I had never seen before. One of the great things about drive is that it manages to work its magic in 100 minutes, which is by no means a long running time. The characters in drive are vivid and feel extremely real. Carey Mulligan is excellent as Irene, a young single mother who falls for Ryan Gosling's mysterious stunt/get away driver. Ron Perlman is entertaining as Nino, a loud-mouth and arrogant mob boss. Brooks is especially fantastic as the soft spoken but vicious Bernie Rose, who is pretty handy with a razor. Yet the most amazing thing about Drive is the performance of its leading man. Gosling is magnetic as 'the Driver' a stunt driver who moonlights as a get away driver for criminals. The driver is a quiet character who doesn't talk much but this allows Gosling to display his exception ability as an actor. With so little talk, Gosling conveys the feelings of his mysterious character through facial expression and simple looks in his eyes. He is able to convey both a kindness and caring in some scenes yet in others he is a figure of intimidation and brutality.The overall non-verbal nature of the mysterious main character adds to the overall tension of the film. The film is excellently paced and extremely entertaining. The film's marketing suggests primarily action scenes but that is not the case as the film is a character study of sorts, but don't shy away from this film because it isn't strictly speaking an action movie. Refn's film is extremely tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is definitely worth watching. The sound track is also extremely good and fits the film nicely. In addition, the the satin jacket Gosling wears throughout is perhaps one of the coolest things i've ever seen.Drive is one of my favorite films and it has a unique style that makes it a fantastic film to watch. Tense and entertaining, Refn and Gosling mesmerize you from beginning to end.",10,4,8,9 September 2012
Prometheus," An intriguing science fiction film from a master director
","Ridley Scott, who created arguably two of the greatest science fiction films ever made in Alien and Blade Runner has long been absent from the genre he has helped make great. While he has made some excellent films since his exit from science fiction, his return has long been awaited. His return, a big budgeted film called Prometheus is a must see. This R rated 130,000,000 million dollar film seems to be worth every cent put it into and more.While not quite as fearsome or tense as Alien and perhaps not as thought provoking or visionary as Blade Runner, this film is no doubt worth watching. The title itself is extremely provocative and speaks to the core and themes of the film, such as warning us of the danger of overextending your grasp, and the consequences of our thirst for knowledge. And the dangers of the quest for answer, one that might beyond our comprehension or ability to accept. It asks us the question of what happens when we go looking for answer and find something more horrible than anything we could imagine. The plot is fascinating. A group of scientists travel to a distant planet in a space ship called Prometheus to search for the origins of the human race. The cast is excellent. Noomi Rapace, the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo stars as the heroine Elizabeth Shaw. Thought not exactly a tough character she proves her grit throughout the film. Rapace is excellent as portraying Shaw as an educated scientist and later a women in a desperate battle for survival. Michael Fassbender is nothing short of amazing as David, the android aboard the ship. The android David is brilliant, arrogant,and harboring his agendas behind a cool and sometimes expressionless face. His favorite film is Lawrence of Arabia and he models his hair after Peter O'Toole's Lawrence. Charlize Theron, Idris Elba all are excellent in supporting roles. Guy Pearce is also excellent thought not easily recognizable as the old Peter Weyland. He looks authentically old and wrinkly. The special effects in the film are nothing short of incredible, as are the costumes. While Prometheus's story can be sometimes a little predictable and the movie is a little slow moving, the film is very good. While elements of Alien are used and fans will notice similarities, at no time did this feel like a sequel or prequel. It works well on its own. The alien's designed for the film are very grotesque and creepy looking and they look fantastic. The visual effects team deserves a lot of recognition. This film while not a masterpiece is fascinating, thought provoking, and intensely entertaining. Make sure to see this film.",9,3,5,11 October 2012
