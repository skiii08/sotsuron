Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," How Could they even allow this movie to be released?
","All right so this movie was funny, agreed. But it literally crossed all limits of being offensive to a community, rather an entire nation. I didn't really see where the humor was in insulting a entire country, ninth largest nation of the world. I am not from Kazakhstan and i have never been there but i can bet they are not as dumb as portrayed in this movie. People from Kazakhstan don't have a sense of humor,they are dumb,they get into incestuous relationships,they don't use toilets, they can drink from where others pee,they have never seen an elevator in their entire lives,they don't give equal rights to women,they consider women merely as sex toys....do you really think that abusing a community in this way can ever be healthy humor?",1,0,3,23 April 2009
