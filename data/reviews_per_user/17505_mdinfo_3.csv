Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fairytale or Nightmare? (spoilers)
","After viewing 'The Phantom Menace' I find myself wondering what I liked about Star Wars in the first place.  I had to go back and view the first three films.  Now, after viewing Phantom in context with those movies, I can see what's missing:  emotional substance.  This film has no soul.  The original trilogy was like a modern day fairytale with grand adventure and high drama.  This film is very consistent in tone.  There is no suspense or unpredictability.  No guessing as to how the fairytale will turn out.  And the main problem with the story of episode one is that its a fairytale that has too much reality in it.The basic political dispute in 'Phantom' is too similar to real life.  Who wants to go to a fantasy film and see government infighting?  You can see that on C-Span.  Also, the creatures in 'Phantom' are all based on real life ethnic stereotypes.  Jar Jar, Watto & The Trade Federation leaders all have accents that cut way too close to racism.  In fact, the film makes it appear that we are supposed to laugh only because these characters' accents are funny sounding.  How lame can you get?The truly interesting parts of the film, the ones steeped in fantasy are ruined here.  The blossoming love story of Anakin & Queen Amidala has no joy to it and seems forced and unnatural.  And who could of guessed that seeing Obi-Won & Darth Vader in their pre-Jedi stages could be so unabsorbing. The development of these two characters is abysmal and sadly, non-sensical. Young Darth Vader aka Anakin Skywalker is so disimilar to his later incarnation you'll think your watching Home Alone 4.The saddest thing about 'Phantom Menace' is how much effort & talent went into making such a bad movie. The actors:  Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman & Jake Lloyd all look silly here.  And draggin down people like Samuel Jackson & Terence Stamp is unforgiveable.  The biggest sin of Episode One is how Lucas wastes the talents of ILM.  So much detail work is put into the Pod Race, light saber duel, ground battle & space battle its a shame that Lucas couldn't show more of each.  Lucas instead impatiently moves onto the next plot point, never letting a scene or setting breathe.
All in all, this latest chapter in the Star Wars fantasy turns out to be more of a nightmare.",Null,0,1,15 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Come On Get Happy (spoilers)
","This is a strange movie that is the antithesis of 'The Empire Strikes Back.' While 'Empire' was dark and moody, 'Return of the Jedi' is as light as a feather.  All of the tension and suspense of the last movie is gone here. The story moves more slowly, the character tension is mild and the overall mood is playful and goofy.  'Jedi' is pure fairytale, but unfortunately, the characters in the fable aren't very interesting.Coming on the heels of Empire's cliffhanger ending, Jedi raises more questions than answers.  The first, why are people as powerful as Luke, Leia & Lando having so much trouble freeing Han from an overweight, greedy Jabba the Hutt?  This scene shouldn't of taken a 1/4 of the movie to get done. Second, why is Luke suddenly all polished & somber like?  In the last film, he was really struggling with his future.  Third, why are Lando & Han suddenly best of pals?  As Empire ended, Han wanted to kill Lando for betraying him and his friends.  Now, in 'Jedi' they are best of friends.
After the rescue scene, the movie's tone was set.  'Come on get happy.' Everything was played for fun from then out.  The Ewoks, the space battle & Han & Luke's time on Endor.  Even the evil Emperor comes off like the wicked witch in the 'Wizard of Oz.'  Only a tamer version.  I admire George Lucas & co for trying to create a modern day fairytale.  Unfortunately, the final product doesn' turn out to be that captivating.  The acting has no soul, the scenes are forgettable, and the dialogue is unoriginal.
The only true emotional pull of the film comes from the character tension between Luke & Vader.  Mark Hamill really makes these scenes touching with his heartfelt pleas to his father to change his evil ways.  Unfortunately, this scenes are few and far between. In final, this film should of been a lot better.  A disappointing conclusion to the original trilogy that only grows worse with the passage of time.",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Gets better with age (spoilers)
","20 years after its release, 'The Empire Strikes Back' continues to improve with the passage of time.  This film has substance and I personally, catch something new everytime I see it.  My favorite thing about this movie is that it never lets up.  The suspense and tension builds throughout the full 2 hours.The main antagonist of the story is the evil Empire, led by Darth Vader, who is unrelenting in his pursuit of the Rebel Alliance.  Vader simply never lets up, focusing his efforts on capturing Han Solo & Princess Leia, and using them to get to his main prize:  Luke Skywalker.  I thought it was brilliant how the story was told, because you can't tell what's going to happen next.  Every scene has a surprise and a cliffhanger.
My favorite scenes involved the Star Destroyer, led by Vader, pursuing the Milennium Falcon with Han & Leia.  The part where Han flies into an asteroid field is breathtaking.  The music during this scene is perfect and adds to the suspense.  I also liked when Han decides to 'turn around and attack' the Star Destroyer and then hides on back of the ship.  Finally, the most memorable scene of the film is the 'carbonation' scene where Han is frozen. This is a sad scene and Harrison Ford's acting is flawless.
As a bonus you get Luke, Yoda and the unforgettable light saber duel between Vader & Luke.  I think 'Empire' is what makes movie viewing great.  The great story, the adventure, the surprises & the pure escapist thrill of it all.  And the best thing about this movie is that it holds up so well after all these years.  So much attention to detail and dialogue really helps this movie remain a classic with very few 'cringe scenes.' You know, scenes where you wish they would of just left that out.In final, this movie is not as fast paced or grounded in fantasy as the other three Star Wars movies.  But I believe its the best.  Sit back and be patient with this one.  Surviving the suspense is worth it.",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
