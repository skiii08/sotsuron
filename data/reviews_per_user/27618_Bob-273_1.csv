Antz," It's a maybe see once, but never again, movie!
","It is a BIG disappointment that the writers, and producers (and whomever else it could be) find it acceptable or even worse, make the choice to include in dialogue, bad language in a movie they KNOW will be attracting younger crowds.  Children should not be put in a position of being shocked with such trash. Parents should not have to be put in the position of having to apologize and explain if they can, to children about how bad language could appear in a movie 'made for their enjoyment'. How sad  that we can't find decent movies for our children anymore.",3,6,13,9 November 1998
