Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," This film will not disappoint you
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) is on the trail of a case that if left unsolved could lead to a world war. His arch enemy, Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) is in the process of striking fear into the general public and creating political tensions between France and Germany to hopefully start a world war. As he puts it in the film, mankind is prone to fighting and it is inevitable that the world will come to blows...he just wants to own the bullets and the bandages.A gypsy fortuneteller's brother has been recruited by Moriarty to assassinate a prominent government official in hopes that this assassination will be the final straw in a long drawn out plan to move France and Germany to war. Sherlock Holmes, enlisting the aid of his long time friend and colleague, Dr. John Watson (Jude Law) and the fortuneteller, Madam Simza Heron (Noomi Rapace), set out to foil Moriarty's plot and put an end to his reign of terror.I actually enjoyed this film more than the first 'Sherlock Holmes' released in 2009. The balance of action and humor are excellent and the chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law is excellent. Jared Harris is very good in his part as the evil Moriarty. The film, although 129 minutes in length, moves along at a great pace. The use of slow motion during a scene when our heroes are fleeing a most dangerous situation is excellent.I recommend this film even if you didn't see the first one you should enjoy installment #2. I have a feeling there may be a 3rd iteration in the coming years.",8,3,10,19 December 2011
Creed," Rocky - reborn
","It has been almost 40 years since 'Rocky' burst onto the scene and wowed the film world with 10 academy award nominations and garnering 3 wins. Rocky went on to become one of the most successful film franchises of all time with 'Rocky I - V', 'Rocky Balboa', and released this year, 'Creed'.Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordon) is the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Apollo was killed in the ring (Rocky IV) before Adonis is born. His mother dies when he is a small child and Adonis becomes a product of Foster Care. He is a troubled youth and spends a lot of time in Juvenile detention. Apollo's wife, Mary Anne Creed (Phylicia Rashad), comes to Adonis' rescue and takes him out of the foster system.Flash forward; Adonis works in an investment bank but just doesn't feel he is fulfilling his destiny. He quits his job and moves to Philadelphia where he seeks out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). He convinces Rocky to train him as a fighter.The film does slow down at times but overall is an enjoyable 133 minutes. You don't need to be familiar with the Rocky films, but it does help in filling in the back story of the characters. The movie, however, can stand on its own - unlike the final film of the 'Hunger Games' series. This film is rated PG-13.This is 'Rocky' for a new generation. A young unknown fighter getting a shot at the big time.If you have an afternoon or evening to spare - go see 'Creed'.",7,1,6,30 November 2015
Horrible Bosses," Funny Enough
","I went to see this film with the highest of expectations. After all, Rotten Tomatoes has 73% positive from the critics and 80% positive from audiences around the country. Must be good right? I found the film to be funny enough. Jasen Bateman is very good in his role as Nick Hendricks, the loyal employee trying to kiss Dave Harken's (Kevin Spacey) butt enough to get the coveted promotion to senior VP. Kevin Spacey - who is good in most every part I have seen him play - does and excellent job as the boss you just love to hate. Charlie Day plays Dale, a dental assistant, constantly being sexually harassed by his Dentist boss, Jennifer Aniston. The trio of friends is rounded out by Jason Sudeikis who plays Kurt who loves his boss but hates his bosses son. Of course, to move the movie forward, tragedy strikes, and Kurt must now suffer at the hands of Bobby (Colin Ferrell).The three buddies, lamenting their sorry work lives at the local bar, hatch a scheme to hire a hit-man to rid them of their 'Horrible Bosses'. On their quest to find such an individual, they run across Dean MF Jones (Jamie Foxx) who becomes their 'murder consultant'.Many of the funniest lines and scenes are in the trailers, but there are a few surprises and it does have some solid humor throughout the film. This film is a go, but if you can get the matinée price - do that.",5,2,4,10 July 2011
Bridesmaids," Funny-Funny-Funny!!!
","I have heard a comedic film is the most difficult to do and be successful. 'Bridesmaids' is a film that meets this challenge head on and pulls it off admirably.Annie (Kristen Wiig) is a down-on-her-luck 30 something who is barely scraping by after her bakery failed. Her lifelong best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), gets engaged and asks Annie to be her Maid of Honor. Although honored she is chosen, Annie feels as if her life is on a rapid decline and Lillian's is on the path to success.Determined to do the very best job at planning all of the pre-wedding activities she arrives at the engagement party and is introduced to the rest of the bridesmaids. She finds a rival 'Lillian best friend' in Helen (Rose Byrne) and the no holds barred competition for Lillian's approval leads to laugh-out-loud antics and situations until Lillian disappears on the morning of the actual wedding day. Annie and Helen need to bury the hatchet to find Lillian and hopefully get Lillian 'to the church on time.' The remaining bridesmaids, Becca (Ellie Kemper), Rita (Wendy McLendon-Covey) and especially Megan (Melissa McCarthy) are all funny in their own right and without their contribution the film would not be as worthwhile. John Hamm, of 'Mad Men' fame plays Ted, Annie's on again - mostly off again relationship.The film works well and although there are some pretty silly scenes the overall experience is enjoyable and the whole audience seemed to enjoy as well.I recommend this film.",8,3,8,16 May 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," If you enjoy action - this film is for you
","A genius madman – code name Cobalt – has plans to start a nuclear war. After all – million years or so some type of disaster strikes the earth killing most of the living organisms inhabiting our fair planet and yet life goes on. In his mind – nuclear disaster is part of the plan and he is the instrument through which it will occur.Enter the IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is framed for a bombing at the Kremlin and the US government has disavowed the entire IMF. The Secretary (Tom Wilkinson) is to escort Hunt back to Washington from Moscow – however – the car is attacked and Hunt along with the secretaries chief analyst, Brandt (Jeremy Renner) escape the hail of gunfire and begin to devise a plan to recover the nuclear launch device, the launch codes and put an end to Cobalt once and for all. Hunt and Brandt are joined by Jane (Paula Patton) and Benji (Simon Pegg).The film is action packed with some dizzying stunts atop the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. As with the other installments of the Mission Impossible series most of what occurs is almost impossible. Especially the survival rate of Tom Cruise as he experiences several situations that would leave we mere mortals at the cemetery gate. However, knowing that it is pure fantasy upfront leads to a very entertaining experience.If you are an action film fan you will definitely enjoy this one although the 133 minute run time is a little long.",7,1,2,19 December 2011
Drive," Gritty and Violent
","I'll give you 5 minutes. If anything happens within that five minutes, I'll stick with you no matter what. If something happens on either side of that five minutes – you are on your own.Ryan Gosling is a quiet unassuming loner in LA working days in a garage and as a stunt driver – at night a high paid 'wheel man'.The opening police hunt for the late model silver Impala and Gosling's expertise at avoiding capture is done very well and is very suspenseful. The film, opening on this high note, for the most part continues running on all cylinders.Shannon (Bryan Cranston) owns the garage where Gosling works and helps out with Ryan's stunt work. His dream is to get a race car and have Ryan drive. He approaches Bernie (Albert Brooks) to invest in his dream. Bernie, who partners with Nino (Ron Perlman) are a couple of unsavory characters who would just as soon shoot you as say hello. In the mean time, Gosling meets and begins falling for his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan). Irene appears to be a single mother, however, she is really married. Her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), is in prison. Standard get released and has a debt he must pay. Gosling agrees to help him out and between the involvement with Bernie and Nino and a botched Pawn Store heist.things begin going terribly wrong.I liked this movie – but I feel it is a movie you are either going to really like or not like at all. Not much in betweenthe film is gritty and violent – not much happiness is portrayed during its 100 minute run time. The film is rated R and is definitely not for younger viewers. I recommend this one.",Null,1,7,18 September 2011
The Hangover Part II," Rehash of the previous film
","I have been in theater withdrawal - haven't been to a movie in a couple of weeks - so, ventured out today to see 'The Hangover part 2'.I really don't have to provide a summary for this film - substitute: Bride's younger brother for groom, monkey for tiger, Bangkok for Las Vegas and you basically know the rest (if you saw 'The Hangover'). There are some very funny scenes in this movie and it was worth the $5 matinée price - but I wouldn't pay full price for basically the same movie I saw in 2009. As usual with sequels - the original movie was definitely the better of the two.I am going to guess we can expect a 3rd edition of this movie - maybe the creators of film series hope the audiences are like Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis in that we will all have total memory loss and shell out our hard earned cash to see the wolf pack in another fine mess.I recommend you wait for on-demand or Netflix or your local video store - or like me, a matinée.",3,2,5,4 June 2011
Super 8," See it on the 'BIG' screen
","As we grow older and hopefully wiser we seem to look back to our past as 'simpler' times. A time of innocence. It is during this 'simpler' time, 1979, when Charles (Riley Griffiths) - a want-to-be director, enlists the aid of his junior high friends to make a 'Super 8' movie. His dream is to enter his movie in an upcoming contest and of course win fame and fortune. It is during the filming of an all important scene when Joe (Joel Courtney) notices a white pick-up truck enter the path of a speeding freight train. As the kids run for cover, the camera is left running and films the entire crash. The train disaster unleashes a secret that has been kept from the American public since 1958. The arrival of the military and their very hush hush demeanor has the town deputy looking for answers.The group of young filmmakers continue on and when the original role of super 8 film is returned from the lab (remember when you had to wait for film to be developed?), Joe and Charles get a look at why the military has occupied the peaceful burg of Lillian, Ohio.Government conspiracy, man's inhumanity to anything different than ourselves, rivalry between friends, young love and most of all being able to let go of your past to grow and move into the future are all explored during the 112 minute run time.This film is definitely worth a trip to the theater to see on the big screen. The special effects would loose some of their impact - even on those 55' and 60' full HD TV's.The 'secret' is kept hidden enough to keep the audience guessing and ads to some 'shock' moments that may make you jump.Overall and enjoyable film - rated PG-13 the film could be disturbing to some younger viewers - I recommend you go see this one.",8,8,18,9 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Very Good but not Great
","It has finally come to an end - the long awaited 2nd half of the final book of the Harry Potter series opened to audiences worldwide July 15th. Most critics have given it rave reviews and audiences for the most part have loved the final chapter of this film series.The movie is full of excellent special effects and prior characters who have died in previous films make cameo appearances (as spirits of course) to aid Harry in his quest to conquer Voldemort.You won't be disappointed with this movie and the short epilogue at the conclusion of the film puts the final end on the Harry Potter series - but - it leaves the door open for future films about Harry, Hermione and Ron's children.If you are a Harry Potter fan - you should definitely see this final film - if you haven't been a fan I think you will still like the it - but you should familiarize yourself with the story and characters before going to the theater...it will make the movie more enjoyable.",Null,0,0,16 July 2011
