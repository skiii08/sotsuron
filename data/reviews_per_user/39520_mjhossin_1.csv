The Equalizer," Too slow or Too less action?
","The beginning of this movie is too slow.
The story was not as I expected. But It seems to me that this movie could have been finished early.
And I guess this is a action movie, and McCall is a very strong and skillfull man as we can see in the movie, but he kills the Main villain of the movie without showing any skill. As we see, The villain called 'Teddy' is also a good skillfull fighter. Then, at the end of the movie why there was no hand to hand fighting scene?Although , I liked the last part where the lady came back and talk to McCall.My opinion is that, this movie could have been better.",6,0,0,12 March 2019
