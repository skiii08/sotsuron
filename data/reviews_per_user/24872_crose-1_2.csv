Requiem for a Dream," A disturbing, downward spiral that stays with you
","Man, this movie had some of the best acting, camerawork & editing in recent memory. A tough, bitter pill to swallow, yet so well done it grips you and you can't turn away till the credits roll. This movie's disturbing imagery stuck with me for weeks afterwards.As Roger Ebert said, this flick should be required viewing for anyone contemplating trying heroin. Elley Burstyn should've won an academy award for her role. I'd see it again but I seriously don't know if I could handle it.",10,0,1,2 May 2002
Mulholland Drive," Giant, steaming waste of time & money
","How does David Lynch do it? Unlike the legions of thick-black-framed-glasses-wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise his name, I just don't see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such tripe. How can Lynch sloppily cobble together leftover footage from a failed TV pilot into a nonsensical, poorly-acted mess & have critics rave about it & actually include it on Year's Best lists?I'm baffled. If you're looking for a good film noir, rent 'Bound' instead. If you're looking for a good 'puzzle' movie try 'Memento.' But beware of this over-hyped stinker unless your idea of a fun night is throwing away 2 1/2 hours of your life & $3.50 of your hard-earned cash.",1,29,62,2 May 2002
