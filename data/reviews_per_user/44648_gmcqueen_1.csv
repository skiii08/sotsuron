Blade Runner 2049," Biggest piece of crap I've ever seen.
","Biggest piece of crap I've ever seen. Three hours of it. Bad acting. Chintzy sets.Poorly written, no suspense. I could have written it, designed the sets, acted it and shot it and done a better movie all by myself. All involved should hang their heads in shame. Ridley Scott should retire he's lost it. Ryan gosling was a boring one-note throughout. The only bright spark was brief and that pretty dim. Harrison Ford. I am so unhappy that his project was undertaken at all.",1,30,66,6 October 2017
