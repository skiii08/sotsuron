Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Excellent Mind Tricks
","I have watched this movie 2 times, at the first one i've just focused on the main subject, the second one was for the details on movie. it was absolutely fantastic, i hope that the 3rd one will be on the way soon! By the way, the subject choice was better than the first movie, because i can truly say that you will have 4 different mood while watching it. Jude Law is also very successful at playing his role. If you want to go a funny exciting journey with Sherlock, you should really watch this movie, i bet you will understand what i meant :) Hoping to see next comment will be alright, because i don't expect anyone who doesn't like Sherlock's interesting life :)",10,1,2,19 January 2012
