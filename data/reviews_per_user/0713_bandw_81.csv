The Double Life of Véronique," Disappointed on first viewing, more impressed on the second
","This is a story of two women, the Polish Weronika and the French Véronique. Both women are played by the stunningly beautiful and captivating Irène Jacob. Weronika gets her story told in the first third and then Véronique has her turn. In addition to their being identical in physical appearance the two women share many other traits. Both are musically talented, have similar heart conditions, are the same age, and have parallel experiences. While the two never meet, they intuit the existence of each other in some mysterious ways. This storyline may be hard to swallow for the literal minded, but the movie is not out to convince us of anything, but rather to create a mood and have us consider possibilities. I think most people have wondered who on the earth most resembles them in appearance and experience and this film taps into that speculation by way of exaggeration. And who knows, is what happens in this movie any stranger than the existence of entangled particles at the atomic scale where a change in the state of one effects a change in the other no matter the distance separating them?Much is left to the interpretation of the viewer and anyone who is looking for some definite meaning will most likely be disappointed. Many scenes and events seem to be of little relevance. For example, when Weronika is having an acute heart problem she looks up and sees a man in an overcoat walk by and expose himself. These ridiculous events certainly happen in everyday life, but why put this in here? There is a stern, scowling woman who appears in both stories, but there is no hint given as to her tie-in.This is artfully filmed and could be considered a warm-up for Kieslowski's 'Three Colors: Red,' since many scenes are lighted in soft red light and many physical objects are red. The lighting takes full advantage of Ms. Jacob's beauty. Given the musical talents of the two women, it is not surprising that music plays a key role in the film. There is a concert scene that has Weronika singing an incredibly magnificent aria. I played that scene several times. The soundtrack composed by Zbigniew Preisner lends a haunting quality to the proceedings and much would be lost without it. In a playful twist, music from an 18th-century Dutch composer, Van den Budenmayer, is referenced and played. Turns out that this is a pure creation of Preisner.The Criterion Collection DVD has an alternate ending for the U. S. version. Any additional significance contained therein was lost on me.When I first watched this I did not much appreciate it. Thinking that maybe I had missed something I watched it again and was glad that I did, since I found it much more engaging. Perhaps I was too busy reading subtitles on first viewing and missed the exceptional visual qualities. And I was better able to follow the subtle courtship game that Véronique and her suitor were playing.",9,1,1,23 March 2012
Spartacus," The strengths far outweigh the weaknesses
","This story takes place in the first century B.C. at the tail end of the Roman Republic and just prior to the era of the Roman Empire. The historical accuracy of the film has been questioned (for example, any Sempronius Gracchus had been dead before Crassus arrived on the scene), but history does confirm that Spartacus led a slave revolt at the time and he was defeated by Crassus. That historical backdrop was enough history for me to forgive any fictional embellishments.There is such a wealth of things to appreciate in this epic movie that I am willing to forgive most all of its weaknesses. Laurence Olivier's performance as the Roman general Crassus is estimable. Given Olivier's enormous talent you might think he might just go through the motions in this role (and even that would probably have been worth seeing), but his Crassus is truly captivating--he plays the part with such gusto that you believe he would really like to have been Crassus. Peter Ustinov is here in an Oscar-winning performance as Batiatus, a trainer of gladiators. Ustinov plays the obsequious and avaricious Batiatus with such gentle humor that he steals almost every scene he is in. For example, when Crassus and his retinue visit Batiatus he tells his servant to serve the 'second-best wine. No, the best, but small goblets.' Charles Laughton, at the top of his form playing the devious and wily senator Gracchus, is a pure delight. He is prone to making cynical comments like, 'We buy everything else these days, there's no reason we shouldn't pay for patriotism.' And when Batiatus claims to be seized with an attack of integrity, Gracchus comments that in the current political climate it is easier to die from that than from disease. Tony Curtis is well cast as the sensitive 'singer of songs' who wants to be a soldier. Kirk Douglas has some fine moments, he looks the part and has probably never been better. One weakness among the main actors I felt was Jean Simmons as the slave Lavinia. Though she and Douglas have some fine and tender moments together, like when Spartacus first meets her in the gladiator school, Simmons often looked a bit too fresh and lovely for a woman in her situation. John Gavin, as Julius Caesar, did not project the strength one associates with such a historically powerful man. But, if you cannot appreciate the acting on display here, then I think you cannot appreciate acting.Alex North's score can be a bit intrusive at times, but overall it's impressive and suitable for such a grand epic. The four minute overture and the intermission could be cut from the DVD without much loss I think.There is some sharp dialog throughout. For example, Crassus to his wimpy son-in-law: 'One of the disadvantages of being a patrician is that occasionally you're obliged to act like one.' Or this exchange between Gracchus and Caesar:Caeser: So, now we deal with pirates. We bargain with criminals.Gracchus: Don't be so stiff-necked about it. Politics is a practical profession. If a criminal has what you want you do business with him.The day before the big battle scene is cleverly filmed with Spartacus' speech to his troops being inter-cut with Crassus' speech outside the Roman Senate. Spartacus' speech was a little odd in that his troops stretched for what looks like a mile or more, so really only the first few people before him could have heard him. You have to accept this as movie-making for effect.The climatic battle scene between the armies of Spartacus and Crassus is truly spectacular. I have never seen anything more transfixing. The combination of the score and the way it is filmed, cutting back and forth between the two camps as the Roman army approached, built the tension to a fever pitch. It was hard not to think of Branagh's excellent filming of the Battle of Agincourt in his Henry V--but this is better. Spartacus walking among his army the night before the big battle also reminds one of a similar scene in Henry V that has Henry walking among his troops.One test of the quality of a movie for me is how well I remember it. I had not seen this film since I saw it in its original release, but I was amazed by how many of the scenes I remembered after fifty years, and even remembered some of the dialog.The Blu-ray print is pristine, it renders the richness of the colors, costumes, and sets to full effect. Seeing this on a small screen in anything but its 1.85:1 aspect ratio would significantly reduce its effectiveness I would suspect. While this film does not illustrate Stanley Kubrick's signature style, the meticulous attention to detail and artful camera work indicate that there is a keen artist behind the proceedings.",10,1,3,24 January 2011
Chinatown," Great look, great picture
","Jack Nicholson plays private investigator J.J. Gittes. The time is 1937 and the place is Los Angeles. Gettis specializes in infidelity cases. Most of his clients seem to be ordinary folk, but one day a woman shows up who purports to be Mrs. Hollis Mulwray, the wife of the chief engineer of the Los Angeles Water and Power department, and things get complicated and interesting from there.The story has the trappings of a film noir, but it separates itself from that genre in several ways. For one thing it is in color. The use of a muted color palette creates a sense of the times. The depiction of 1930s Los Angeles is done well enough to have convinced me of its authenticity--the cars, houses, and dress seem to be right. I particularly liked the appearance of a pristine Social Security card in a wallet, 1937 being the first year of the issuance of such cards. Jerry Goldsmith's score is notable, accentuating the tense scenes without being intrusive. The main theme sets a plaintive note that had me longing for the past. The movie is so fixed in the era it depicts that it should be timeless in its appeal.Another thing that sets this movie apart from the classic film noir is having Gittes being well dressed and polite, not displaying the hard core cynicism typical of such characters. He also shows vulnerabilities that hard-boiled PIs usually do not have. And his business is doing well enough to have two employees he refers to as his 'operatives.'Nicholson is pretty much in every scene and we see the whole movie from his viewpoint. It's hard to imagine a more perfect actor for this part; Nicholson's performance is a pure delight to watch. Pretty much the same can be said for Faye Dunaway as Mrs. Mulwray. The whole cast is top notch. The story unfolds seamlessly just feeding us enough information to keep our interest, but close attention must be paid. We are left discovering the facts along with Gittes.I saw this in its original release, but the Blu-Ray DVD has left a more lasting impression on me than my original viewing. Full use is made of filming in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, creating a sense of ease and openness. The DVD has lots of extras filmed in 2009: a full feature commentary by screenwriter Robert Towne, interviews with Nicholson and Polanski, a history of the Los Angeles water supply (that I found surprisingly interesting), and an appreciation short that had various people commenting on their reactions to the movie. Polanski commented that he ranks 'Chinatown' as his second best work, being edged out by 'The Pianist.'I can't find anything negative to say about this movie.",10,0,1,30 December 2013
To Be or Not to Be," A dissenting opinion
","This movie about a company of Polish actors during the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 does have laughs (Hitler's 'Heil myself!') and it is intricately and cleverly plotted and plays well as an intrigue. But I had a hard time with the mixing of comedy within the context of a real setting. One minute we are witnessing an air raid on Warsaw and the next we have Carol Lombard imagining what a triumph it would be to play the role of a concentration camp victim wearing an elegant dress. Maybe that was meant to illustrate the dominance of personal ego even in the face of tragedy, but the mood shifts were too much for me.The Nazis are made to appear as easily duped buffoons. Mocking the insanely serious using comedy can work, but it has to be done with some idea of a payoff other than a few laughs. What is the point of making a high-ranking Nazi appear a fool? Is such misrepresentation meant to give comfort in having those viewers in 1942 think that the Nazis would be pushovers? Is being made to believe that Nazis are easily persuaded by simple ruses a worthy goal? I don't see it.I ask myself why this film and Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful' seriously bothered me whereas I found Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' and Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove' hilarious and trenchant. I think it is because the latter two are marked as satire from beginning to end, whereas the former two are stories set in a real time and place. While the targets of Chaplin's barbs in 'The Great Dictator' are immediately obvious, the slight remove from reality makes all the difference.",6,7,21,27 November 2006
Erin Brockovich," Showcase for Roberts, but not much else.
","This movie struck me as primarily a vehicle to put Julia Roberts on display - and that is not without its positive aspects. But did I ever once believe that I was not seeing Julia Roberts play Erin Brockovich? No. This was too much a showpiece for Roberts, rather than a movie that could seriously involve us in a drama with tremendous potential. I think it might have been more affecting to have the real Erin Brockovich play the part.I like Albert Finney, but he seemed less than convincing in this. In a scene where he is standing on a stage before a large audience trying to convince them to sign on to a deal that was probably in their best interests, but that many did not take to, he was not convincing to me. After his speech, Roberts told him, 'You were good.' But he wasn't.Many scenes were clearly enhanced for dramatic and humorous effect and I never felt that we were seeing a true story unfold. Compare this with 'Silkwood,' a movie with a similar theme. There the focus was on the story and not on the star power of its protagonist. Or compare it to the recent 'Pollock,' where you felt you were seeing the real thing played very straight.Having said all this, I have to admit that this movie did go down pretty smoothly while I was watching it. It was only thinking about it afterward that I realized that it could have been much more.",7,1,4,12 March 2001
I'm Not There," Ambitious film that fails
","This is a fictionalized biography based on the life of Bob Dylan. Since Dylan has presented so many faces to the world, the premise of splitting Dylan into six different personas each performed by a different actor is a clever concept. But the presentation is so jumbled and pretentious that it became increasingly more of a chore for me to finish watching this.I have long appreciated Dylan's music and his way with words and, after having seen this film, I think I should just leave it at that. If you do not know much about Dylan the person, then I think this film will confuse you and leave you cold; if you do have some knowledge of Dylan's life, then I think this film will disappoint you. For example, if you have seen Scorsese's 'No Direction Home,' you will remember the eloquent interview with Joan Baez there; here we have Julianne Moore standing in for Baez and the interviews with her have none of the emotional power that the real woman conveys. The real Baez comes across as genuine, intelligent, and insightful; Moore comes across as ersatz and shallow. So many times I just wanted to see the real people and not these actors.In scenes showing the aggressiveness of the interviewers that plagued Dylan, director Haynes totally rips off similar scenes from Fellini's '8 1/2.' He continues with a Fellini imitation in some of the latter scenes and those scenes I found pretentious and meaningless. Haynes is no Fellini.We get a good sampling of Dylan's music, some of it sung by Dylan, but too much of it not.After watching this I pulled out some Dylan recordings and listened to them. What a relief to tap into the real thing without being distracted by this movie.",4,4,5,18 November 2008
The Big Lebowski," The Big Bust
","I recently saw an interview with Jeff Bridges where he commented that he has become personally identified with 'The Dude,' the character he plays in this movie. He also noted that 'The Big Lebowski' has developed a cult following. The interviewer added some praise. That, together with the high rating on IMDb, convinced me to give this a shot. Early on I realized that the story was not to be taken seriously. This movie is a series of loosely connected comedy sketches (well, some hardly connected at all). The result is an absurdest comedy that had very few laughs for me.I did not find The Dude at all appealing as a person. How much is there to admire in someone whose life goals seem to be bowling and drinking white Russians? I do give Bridges credit for inhabiting the role. John Goodman's character really grated on me--his passions seem to be bowling and the f word. The positives: the scenes with John Turturro gave me some laughs; the scenes filmed from within a bowling ball were an interesting curiosity; some non sequiturs were worth a few chuckles.I guess one person's humor is another person's tedium. I found this movie to be tedious.",2,55,106,1 May 2013
As Good as It Gets," Well acted comedy/drama
","I came to this with some reservations, fearing that it was going to be yet one more movie to milk the theme of misanthrope redeemed by the power of love. And it was that, but it had enough unique qualities that it worked for me. I was sucked in by it. It flowed along nicely and held my interest.I found the characters to be believable and absorbing. Jack Nicholson has a tendency to go over the top, but I though he was masterful in his creation of Melvin. He seemed to have a real grasp on what Melvin was like. Some of the facial expressions he used when he realized he had screwed up were wonderful, and the fact that Melvin had to be beaten over the head before he knew he had screwed up I thought was much in keeping with the character. I don't think too many actors could have pulled this part off--to play a somewhat despicable character but make you care for him.The acting was uniformly good. I particularly liked Carol's mother.I like the way the movie showed the price some people have to pay for who they are and what they are. Even though the movie had a lot of humor, I admired it for presenting Melvin in a way that made you feel how difficult life was for him. I particularly liked the scene where Melvin asked Simon whether it wouldn't be a lot easier if he just liked women and Simon said 'Do you think your life is easy?' and Melvin said, 'I'll give you that one.' It was a recognition on Melvin's part as to how hard it is to change what we are. So many times Melvin's compulsions put him in conflict with society and his own desires, like when he wanted to dance but couldn't, or not being able to wear the suit and tie offered him in the restaurant. Melvin's gradual improvement made sense to me. He had serious problems and probably was never going to be 'normal,' but isolation usually exacerbates such problems and positive social interaction helps.I don't believe the ending was necessarily a happy one. If Melvin and Carol were ever to have a long term relationship there was going to be some pretty tough sledding ahead.The fact that Melvin was wealthy and had some special talent led him to a better life. I just kept thinking of all the people who have problems similar to Melvin's who live in their private hells with limited ways out. Or was Melvin's life hell before he met Carol? He did make the comment about how meeting her had cut him off from his previous life and he couldn't get back. That would probably be pretty scary for someone like Melvin.",8,1,1,16 August 2012
The Hunger Games," Some good, more bad
","This story takes place in a post-apocalyptic North America where rich, elite, decadent power brokers, located in 'the Capitol,' control twelve distinct oppressed districts.There is a glimmer of substance as social satire, with the controlling government using the obsessive power of television to hold the populace in abeyance by offering them an annual event called 'The Hunger Games,' where twenty-four teenagers are selected (two from each of the twelve districts) to be set loose in a large forested area to go after killing one another until a lone survivor wins the contest. There are TV cameras in every area of the forest so that the event, which is really but a variation on Roman gladiator confrontations, can be broadcast on national TV for viewers to witness the action. The emcee of the show (Stanley Tucci), encapsulates pretty much every disgusting quality in his delivery as any of the talk show or game show hosts that I have ever seen on TV. The irony is that the thing being satirized, the violence and inanity of much of what is offered on contemporary TV, is the very thing that this movie itself offers to its audience as a crowd pleaser--a game where teenagers try to kill each other. The fact that this movie is so popular only proves its satirical point.The story is absurd and if an attempt at logical analysis is made, then a long list of plot holes can be compiled. What are the odds of two people who know each other being selected at random from the thousands in a single district? When the heroine is in ultimate distress, an unknown competitor comes out of nowhere to rescue her? The rules are changed in the middle of the game so that the two finalists, who have fallen for each other, can share the title? Then the rules are changed back? Then changed again? Is it reasonable to pit twelve year old girls against eighteen year old boys in this contest? Is there really delight to be had from seeing an eighteen year old boy kill a twelve year old girl? And so on. Perhaps it is best not to apply reasoning to this movie.The main positive is the appearance of the promising young actress Jennifer Lawrence as the heroine. She plays the part of the tough minded and independent Katniss Everdeen to perfection. Her performance here is not dissimilar to her Oscar nominated performance in 'Winter's Bone.' I look forward to seeing more of her in better movies. Josh Hutcherson, as Lawrence's love interest, turns in a generic performance. Donald Sutherland is on hand as the president, I suppose to give a little gravitas to the proceedings. He offers a profundity from time to time such as, 'A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous.' Surely appearing in this has to be an embarrassment for him; I hope he was well paid.There are some interesting visuals, but I don't think they make any advances in that area beyond what has been done in countless other recent films. In fact, the 1956 'Forbidden Planet' has more imaginative and enticing images.The costuming is bizarre, ranging from 18th century French court to 1940s Hollywood. Wes Bentley, as the game-master, had such an intricately shaped beard that I hope his work was filmed in one day, since getting that thing right every day would be a pain. The government goons were dressed in accordance with commonly conceived stereotypes. This must have been a ripe plumb to land for costume designers, being called upon to implement such wild get-ups.The one thing that drove me absolutely nuts, and almost made me sick, was the filming with a hand-held camera. The camera is in constant motion. I would frequently pray that the camera be held still for just a few seconds, but my prayers were not answered. I can maybe understand this technique where the attempt is to confuse and blur the action in some of the scenes of graphic violence, but the damn camera jerks even when there are just two people talking in close-up. I do not understand what the desired effect is in using this distracting technique. It is obviously willed, since it is not necessary in most scenes, and exaggerated in others.In some ways this movie cheats the audience. Think seriously about this, the premise is grisly but the movie does not carry through on that. Most of the violence is done in rapid takes, blurred images, or off screen. Maybe this was done to preserve a PG rating, but if you are going to set up a horrifying theme, then it should not be covered up with a feel good rendering. The reaction to this movie is a sad commentary on our times. When Shirley Jackson's short story 'The Lottery' appeared in 1948 (the 'winner' is stoned to death), it created controversy and outrage. Now we have 'The Hunger Games' where teenagers are selected by lottery to slaughter each other and there is only audience approval. People who are entertained by this are the same ones who would have been entertained by the gladiator contests in ancient Rome.",3,9,13,12 April 2012
Au Revoir les Enfants," A different coming of age story
","Most coming of age stories usually revolve around resolving a personal conflict like an unrequited first love or something as inconsequential as not making a sports team. Being an adolescent in France in 1944 presented an entirely different scenario. No matter how protected you might have been, coming of age then meant getting exposure to serious issues at a young age.The story is that of two early-adolescent boys who have been sent to a private Catholic boarding school at some remove from heavily targeted areas. One boy, Julien, is the son of wealthy Parisians and the other, Jean, is a Jewish boy who has been taken in by Père Jean, the school's director. The good priest has taken a great risk in hiding Jean at the school, since the Nazi occupiers and French collaborators are never far off.The film develops slowly and lulls you into thinking that not much is happening but, before you know it, you are emotionally committed.The whole cast is excellent; the two child actors are exceptional and perfect for their roles. The film skillfully captures the awkwardness young boys have in expressing their friendship, often to the point of self-denial. But Julien and Jean do ultimately become friends.The boys are at an age where they are feeling their way to an understanding of the world and being in the middle of WWII compounds the difficulties that all adolescents face in this. Julien hears comments about Laval, and Pètain and one kid comments that Jews and Russians are worse than the Nazis. It is difficult to resolve such conflicting opinions, even as an adult. How ill-fated it is that Julien's sudden revelation about his friend and the Nazis and the Jews resulted in unintended tragedy. Even though some of the Nazis are given a human face, by the end of the film Julien has no doubt who the bad guys are as evidenced by his physical withdrawal in the face of a young collaborator.It is refreshing to see priests presented in a favorable light. Père Jean takes his faith seriously and, Christ-like, dies for his acts of compassion.Malle reports that this film is somewhat autobiographical and his making the movie gives testament to how innocent acts of youth that result in unfortunate consequences can haunt you for a lifetime.",9,2,3,16 June 2007
127 Hours," Young and healthy and invincible
","This true story is simple enough. Aron Ralston sets out for a weekend trip to a slot canyon in the Canyonlands National Park in Utah, gets pinned by a boulder, and after five days frees himself and makes it out alive. The movie succeeded in dramatizing the event in a manner that kept my attention. The introduction that has Ralston bicycling in some twenty miles to the entry of the canyon was the highlight of the film for me. It captured the thrill of being alone in a spectacularly magical and beautiful landscape and feeling truly alive. This part of the movie makes a great advertisement for Utah. A Canyonlands travelogue on Blu-ray would make for great entertainment.It was dumb for Ralston not to have told anyone where he was going, which he admits, but I am willing to give him a pass on this, at least from what we see of him in the movie. He was in his 20s, in the peak of health, and an experienced outdoors-man--I could see how he might feel invincible and make the mistake he did.Whereas this movie personalizes the experience, I found the NBC Dateline documentary 'Desperate Days in Blue John Canyon' to have a greater emotional impact. In that film Tom Brokaw accompanies Ralston on a repeat of his fateful journey. This was only six months after the original event and it astonished me that Ralston had the courage to do it. Fitted with a prosthesis he made the whole trip without aid, from lowering himself into the canyon to the repel out. Seeing some of Ralston's actual video as well as hearing the audio of other parts had a much greater impact on me that seeing Franco duplicate it, even as good as Franco is in the role. And we are spared seeing the graphic details of the main event--hearing Ralston describe it is quite enough. This documentary is available on YouTube.It's easy to be convinced of the fragility of life, but the value of this movie is to see the other end of that spectrum, what a body can withstand at the outer limits of endurance.",8,1,4,22 May 2011
Pirate Radio," A good time, particularly for fans of 60s rock music
","In 1966, during a time when rock music was at its height, only a few hours a week were broadcast on English radio. A few music lovers and DJs decided that this was unacceptable and got on boats off the coast in international waters and broadcast to the mainland 24/7. The government did not like this corrupting, immoral music and tried to shut offshore broadcasting down. This movie imagines what it might have been like on one of those 'pirate' ships, a ship called 'Rock Radio.' When I say the movie imagines this, I am not implying that this is an attempt at a documentary; it is rather a whimsical interpretation that gathers together a collection of fun-loving oddballs on board in a story strong on low humor. The crew is all male, except for one female who is lesbian. There is enough character development so that encounters among the crew members are believable, in the context of a crazy story. There are some really funny touches like a Dunkirk-like rescue of the ship's crew at the end.All members in the ensemble cast turn in quality performances. And the scenes involving members of the British government are hilariously satiric. If I were forced to single out an outstanding performance, I would have to point to Kenneth Branagh as Sir Alistair Dormandy. Little did I suspect that Branagh had such a talent for comedy.One main thing that appealed to me was that the cast itself was obviously having such a good time--they were really getting into it and their spirit rubbed off on me. The fact that almost every scene was accompanied by a famous rock-'n'-roll hit from the 60s, often in storyline support of what was happening on screen, made this tribute to rock-'n'-roll a particular treat for me as one who grew up with this music.I think this had to be a labor of love for director Curtis. Highlights of the DVD are the deleted scenes. It's worth watching those scenes with the introductions by Curtis; he points out that it tore his heart out to delete the scenes, since they were some of his favorites. They were deleted since they did not directly advance the storyline, but I see why Curtis liked them. I found them to be some of the most entertaining scenes.I didn't expect to like this, but I was infected by its playful spirit.",8,2,2,28 May 2015
Superbad," Not bad, not great
","I am two generations removed from the high school seniors in this movie, but seeing the movie reminded me of the famous quote of Jean-Baptiste Karr, 'plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose' (the more things change, the more they stay the same). The language now may be cruder and the sex more upfront, but the staples stay the same: friendship, sex, profanity, booze, awkwardness, social classes, porn, impending life changes, and so forth. All the modern innovations don't seem to have changed the equation much, if this movie is in fact representative.Even though the language is pretty raw, the thing I liked about it was how comfortable the kids were with it, like it was just the way they expressed themselves and there was nothing particularly wicked or immoral about it. All three of the main characters are quite likable.The movie is too long - the scenes with the policemen were the least effective and could have been pared down a lot.If my high school experience is any indication, the penis drawings are *way* too creative to have been drawn by any male high schooler. Whoever drew them really got into it - makes you wonder about such a person.If the math teacher is at all typical, then I can understand why many people give up on ever understanding the subject. His statement that, ''i' is an imaginary number, it doesn't really exist' is worthy of rolled eyes and despairing glances. Why did nobody ask why it was being discussed if it does not exist? I really liked the opening credits and they led me to expect more than I got which, I admit, is one of the better entries in the genre (which is not all that much praise). I just felt this movie does not live up its hype.",6,0,3,5 July 2008
Brokeback Mountain," The mystery of love and sex.
","I read the short story 'Brokeback Mountain' in The New Yorker when it was first published in 1997 and it made a deep impression on me. Enough for me to remember it well. So, it was of interest to see that a movie had been made based on the short story. One of the main reasons I liked the story is something that will be lost on almost everyone who sees the movie, and that is the element of surprise; by now most people will have heard that this movie is about 'gay cowboys.' However, in reading the story I had no idea what was coming - the story started with brief descriptions of the two guys and how they signed on for the sheep herding and so on. But then, without any previous hint, the initial sex scene occurs and you are taken in a quite unexpected direction. In anticipation of seeing the movie I reread the story and I can say that the movie is exceedingly faithful to the story. It is surprising that a thirty page story can be turned into a full length movie. Little is left out and only a few things added, like Jack's little contretemps with his father-in-law and the bear scene. In the story Ennis actually scares the bear instead of the other way around. But this is one of those rare cases where the movie meets or exceeds the scope and quality of the source.I ask myself why this tale is so absorbing and one reason I come up with is that it details a relationship that is unique in its realization. In many works of fiction dealing with gay themes a straight person can try to make sense out of the relationships by simply picturing one of the partners as male and the other as female, and that usually works. But this story does not allow for that - it is essential that the two protagonists be male. The story would not work any other way. I like movies that take me to new places, and this one did that.Others have remarked on the fine performance of Heath Ledger here and I concur. I had only seen him before in 'A Knight's Tale' and he seemed all right in a role that was not too demanding. I was tending to write him off as just another pretty boy, but this performance changed that idea. The jury is still out for me on Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps he is a bit upstaged here by Ledger, but I had just a bit more difficulty believing him in his role. Due to the casting the movie did give me a different perspective on the two characters. In reading the story I pictured Ennis as being the more delicate and openly emotional, but that was not my reaction to the guys in the movie. Ennis keeps the lid on his emotions pretty tightly here.The filming is well crafted. The story unfolds in a leisurely and straightforward manner - no fancy camera angles or clever segues. This works well in the telling of this deeply personal love story. The exquisite mountain scenery infuses the movie with a backdrop of beauty that augments the beauty of the relationship. The mountain settings lend credibility. A response to external beauty often evokes a response that, if not sexual, is certainly in that same area of the brain.Before seeing the movie I was curious as to how the initial sex scene would be handled, and it was done in a way to convey exactly what happens in the short story. As to how believable that scene is in terms of the initiation of a homosexual relationship I have spoken to some gay friends. Some feel that it is beyond what they could imagine and they were disturbed that it caters to the stereotype of what gay men always do. But perhaps a more insightful observation was that the two guys in the movie were picturing themselves as straight and had not had any homosexual encounters and, given that background, it was they who were in thrall to the stereotype and figured that that is what a homosexual experience should be. After that initial aggressive introduction to the overtly sexual part of the relationship the movie goes on to show many more tender moments. We come to understand that this movie is much more than being about gay cowboys, but rather it examines the power and mystery of love and sex. It also observes that being gay is still far from being easy - it takes its toll on those with that orientation as well as those who know them and love them.Nobody I have talked with heard the last line in the movie.

The Hustler," A Treasure
","'Fast Eddie' Felson (Paul Newman) is a brash young pool hustler with the talent to compete with the best in the game, namely 'Minnesota Fats' (Jackie Gleason). On his way to his initial confrontation with Fats, Eddie and his older partner Charlie (Myron McCormick) work their hustle in pool halls along the way from California to New York. They have finely tuned their show which consists mainly of convincing the marks that Eddie has mediocre talent and any good shot he makes is luck. Then, when the money is on the table, Eddie comes through with just enough skill to win. But Eddie's desire to play Fats is much more than a hustle--Eddie wants to prove he is the best there is. The first encounter between Eddie and Fats is captured in a masterfully filmed, captivating scene that lasts over twenty minutes. During the course of that scene Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) comes to spectate. Bert is a behind-the-scenes power broker and Scott plays this villainous character to perfection. As an example of how small details can establish character, in one beautiful scene Eddie asks Bert to move, since his continuing to sit in the same chair for hours on end is bothering him. At that point Bert stands up, moves his chair a few inches, and sits back down. By calling Eddie a loser Bert delivers a psychological blow that contributes to Fats' winning. This also sets up pivotal themes about whether Eddie has the mental toughness and true desire to win, and what he is willing to sacrifice for success. These are questions most everyone faces, whether they consciously recognize them or not. Sometimes it is easier not to compete at all, or to buckle under the pressure and back off and settle for less. Anyone who enters the workplace has to figure out how aggressive to be and what they are willing to sacrifice to get ahead. After Eddie's initial defeat he meets Sara (Piper Laurie) in a bar and ultimately takes up with her. The fact that polio has left Sara lame plays a significant role, both actually and symbolically. Although we do not know her background, Sara is a sensitive woman who has been wounded by life and has retreated into alcohol, but her relationship with Eddie starts to bring her back to life--their relationship is crucial to Eddie's ultimately being able to understand the sacrifices made in order to pursue his passion.Each of the main characters is given substantial screen time. Between Newman, Scott, Gleason, Laurie, and McCormick you have five Oscar-worthy performances. And the supporting performances are all quality as well, particularly Murray Hamilton as a rich southern gentleman who plays a high-stakes game of billiards with Eddie. It's too bad that monetary inflation factors cannot be edited into movies-- the $18,000 (which does not seem like all that much now) that Eddie was up on Fats would be over $125,000 in 2009 dollars. So, the guys were playing for some pretty hefty stakes at the time. This movie is a high point in black and white cinema. Filmed in CinemaScope (aspect ratio 2.35:1) it should be viewed on a wide screen for full appreciation. Director Rossen takes full advantage of the CinemaScope format with many shots having three characters in the scene, two of whom are at the edges. The print on the DVD is sharp. I think black and white is a dying or dead art form. Recent movies are rarely filmed in black and white and those that are, such as 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' do not have the crispness of the older ones and it seems that contemporary directors have lost the ability to work in this art form, which is quite distinct from color. Facial expressions are much more dramatic in black and white than in color and can convey subtle reactions and emotions without any dialog being necessary. This is particularly capitalized on in this movie; you are fully focused on the close-ups of Gleason and Scott in scenes that would hardly hold your attention in color. And the use of shadows can be highly effective. Consider the scene where Sara walks down the staircase at the Kentucky party. The shadows of the balusters on the wall accentuate that scene and concentrate your interest on Sara's descent in a way that would be less effective in color. By comparison to this film, Scorsese's follow-up 'The Color of Money' some twenty-five years later is filmed in color and is much less striking. It's not like I am opposed to color ('Lawrence of Arabia' would be a complete dud in black and white), but I regret the passing of an art form.The jazz score (not always up-tempo) by Kenyon Hopkins is perfectly suited to the material. Most of the sets are actual places and that creates an atmosphere of realism. The pool hall is a classic.There is some sharp, meaty dialogue to be had. When Eddie offers the excuse to Bert that he lost to Fats because he got drunk, Bert answers:Sure you got drunk. You have the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning, that can be heavy on your back, too, like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. One of the best indoor sports--feeling sorry for yourself. A sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers. An essential scene has Eddie giving this impassioned observation to Sara:You know, like anything can be great--anything can be great. I don't care. Bricklaying can be great, if a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off.I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about this film.",10,2,3,22 September 2009
Insomnia," A cut above the typical crime drama
","The story has L.A. detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhardt dispatched to Alaska to help solve a brutal murder of a young woman. Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who regards Dormer as one of her heroes, is tasked to work with Dormer and Eckhardt. With that setup I was expecting the usual police procedural but the plot thickens early on when we learn that Dormer and Eckhardt are being investigated by the L.A. Police Department for some shady dealings regarding a previous case. And Eckhardt confides to Dormer that he is about to cut a deal that would implicate his partner, a confession that Dormer does not take with gentlemanly grace.Things get interesting when, in pursuit of the murderer in a heavy fog, Dormer shoots Eckhardt. Did he do it on purpose, or was it an accident? Complications ensue when Burr starts to smell a fish when investigating Dormer's story of the shooting. I liked the concept of the investigator being investigated. When the murderer, Walter Finch (Robin Williams), senses that Dormer is getting hot on his trail he preempts the pursuit by calling Dormer and saying that he has seen the shooting of Eckhardt and can use that for blackmail. The cat and mouse game that Finch and Dormer play is well scripted and engaging.The main thing that separates this from average are the deep insights given into Dormer's psychology. The confusion in his own mind as to whether he purposely shot his friend Eckhardt makes him a haunted and guilt-driven man. His situation is almost identical to that of Gene in 'A Separate Peace' after having caused harm to his friend Finney. Dormer's behavior in the case that he is being investigated for in L.A. also weighs on him. With the death of Eckhardt he has no one to unburden to and having the need to talk about his past he finally tells his story to the woman who runs the hotel where he is staying. This may be a plot device in order for the audience to know just what Dormer is being investigated for, but, given his state of mind, it is believable.Pacino does an admirable job in portraying the gradual decay of Dormer's mental health accompanied by his slide into total exhaustion due to insomnia precipitated by being where it never gets dark. Robin Williams is a standout in the role of the bad guy. The thing that makes his portrayal so chilling is his calm confidence and seeming detachment when talking about his crime. The contrast between him and Dormer sets up a nice contrast. Hilary Swank is good in playing the young enthusiastic detective. All together a good cast.The final fight and shoot-'em-up scene was at odds with the restrained tone of the rest of the movie. I was not aware of the Norwegian original before having seen this version. Many people point to that as being better, so that is encouragement to see the original.",7,0,0,12 May 2012
Match Point," A different side of Woody Allen
","Here Woody Allen has traded in his self-absorbed neurotics (of either the serious or comic variety) for the simply self-absorbed. Chris, a tennis pro who has just quit the circuit to become a pro at an upper-class London club, strikes up a friendship there with Tom, a club member. Chris has worked his way up and is not discomfited with the idea of entering Tom's world, and in short order he is faced with the dilemma of choosing between lust and greed. Lust for Tom's fiancée and greed to join the ranks of the rich - greed enough to enter into a marriage of convenience (at least for him) with Tom's sister. But of course he wants both and, as this movie (and the world) would have it, this is difficult to finesse.Chris' emotional conflicts, and the repercussions of his decisions, are not what is really being addressed here. Allen calls it 'luck,' but I think more accurately the topic is free-will versus determinism. Most people want to believe that, for the most part, where they wind up in life is due to the choices they have made rather than random chance. This movie argues otherwise, implying that major node points in our lives are often decided by nothing more significant than a coin flip. If you had been delayed by five seconds, you would not have had that car crash; if your boss had not eaten that double chili cheeseburger with extra fries and a side of jalapeños before the interview, you would have gotten the big promotion; if you had not met person X, you would have become rich; and so on. In a clever twist, a crucial random event in this movie that looks for all the world like it will spell Chris' demise actually saves him.Some Woody Allen trademarks are still in evidence. The filming is meticulous and the actors attractive. The usual jazz score has been changed to opera (it's great to hear some of those old Caruso recordings), befitting the upscale clientèle. And there are some comments that are classic Allen, like a comment made by a woman in an art gallery about two friends, 'All their neuroses intertwine perfectly and it just works like a charm.'Besides a couple of peripheral characters the people on display are not terribly likable, so it is hard to root for any of them. But perhaps it is one of the strengths of 'Match Point' that it keeps your attention in spite of that.As presented here it does not look like being in the British upper-classes would be much fun.",7,1,1,11 July 2006
Youth," Uniquely cinematic
","Director Sorrentino has been accused of being ostentatious in displaying his talents. In the case of this movie I say that if you've got it, flaunt it. Sorrentino utilizes all of the potential of movies--music, sound, cinematography, acting, and dialog--to create a satisfying whole.The story is of two aging professionals on vacation at a resort in the Alps. One of the two is a retired composer and conductor and the other is a currently active movie director. The conductor/composer is Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine) and the movie director is Mike Boule (Harvey Keitel). The Alpine resort itself is a major character and a feel for the place comes from short takes, like a brief glimpse of a row of bodies sunning themselves, people lining up for a sauna, or nightly stage shows. While Sorrentino has his own style, it is clear he has taken some pointers from Fellini. There is a dreamlike quality to many of the scenes. I never know who deserves credit for such effective camera work, beyond the director and cinematographer there is probably a whole team to thank. Anyway, Sorrentino has a feel for the medium that I find most pleasing.Music plays a significant role, befitting Ballinger's profession. There are some elegantly choreographed scenes. Luna Mijovic plays a masseuse at the resort and I was captivated by every scene she was in. She does some dynamic interpretive dance numbers--the scene that ends with her crossing her arms across her chest as the music fades is beautifully done. The final scene that has soprano Sumi Jo, violinist Viktoria Mullova, the BBC Concert Orchestra, and the Berlin Radio Choir preforming Ballinger's Simple Symphony #3 is a real knockout--it alone makes the movie worthwhile. I backed up and watched that scene several times. The original score by David Lang is impressive. Most movies about a fictional composer usually have some generic compositions, such as 'Mr. Holland's Opus,' but Lang's score adds some real depth here.The main focus of the story is on Fred Ballinger. Initially, by his own admission, he is a disengaged spectator of life, essentially serving his time until the end. But he cannot ignore his innate appreciation of sound. First it is the sounds a candy wrapper makes when rolled between a finger and thumb. Then it is cowbells and cows mooing in a meadow, and then a young lad at the resort playing his violin. Finally he is reengaged as a conductor in the final scene. I found that following Ballinger's gradual reawakening to be moving.The acting is uniformly good. It's nice to see the two old pros Caine and Keitel in good form as well as a strong cameo performance by Jane Fonda. The prostate jokes could have been cut as an improvement.",9,0,3,16 May 2016
Milk," A stop along the road to civil rights for gays
","This film is ostensibly about Harvey Milk, a gay man who was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977, at the age of 47. More broadly the film is about the early gay rights movement and, while sticking pretty much to the facts, it is in clear sympathy with that movement. To its credit it does not hide the fact that Milk had sex with other men. The scenes of homosexuals kissing and being in bed together may not play well with heterosexuals, most of whom I think do not have problems with homosexuals until they think of homosexuals having sex. If the film is honest in dealing with Milk's sexuality, it does hide the fact that he was known to have a quick temper and could be difficult to deal with. As presented here Milk is nothing but praiseworthy. Also, there is no mention of the ugly rioting that occurred after Dan White (Milk's assassin) was given the fairly light sentence of seven years for voluntary manslaughter. Altogether there is little evidence of gays behaving badly.Maybe it is because I had already seen the excellent 1984 documentary 'The Times of Harvey Milk,' but it was hard to see what was special about Harvey Milk based on Penn's performance--he did not come close to capturing the charisma of the real Harvey Milk as seen in the aforementioned documentary. In short, 'The Times of Harvey Milk,' is more illuminating and engrossing than 'Milk.' Josh Brolin (as Dan White) proves once again that he is one good actor and Emile Hirsch offers a winning portrayal of Cleve Jones, a young gay activist. Allison Pill is delightful as Anne Kronenberg, Milk's successful campaign manager.The integration of archival footage with reenactments is a bit confusing. For example, the candlelight march is clearly a mixture of reenactment footage with archival. This left me to wonder what was reenactment and what was real. Were the opening scenes, showing gays being ripped out of bars and arrested for the crime of drinking a beer while gay, for real? This movie tends toward being heavy on message, but you do come away from it with a better understanding of the struggles that gays have had in fighting for their civil rights. Milk's greatest achievement was his successful campaign against California's Proposition 6 that would have banned homosexuals from teaching in public schools. But the struggle continues, as evidenced by the recent passage of California's Proposition 8 that bans gay marriage. As has been said, nobody ever got their rights simply by asking for them.",7,0,2,26 July 2009
Once," Its strength is also its weakness
","This low-budget film about a Dublin street musician who connects with a young Czech woman has much to recommend it. The guy and girl (they are never given names) share an appreciation for music; the guy is much more attuned to pop music whereas the girl has a broader appreciation. All things being equal she tends toward playing classical piano, but she bonds with the guy to the extent of working jointly with him on pop compositions and performances.The two protagonists are of meager means, so I guess it is fitting that the filming is lacking in high-end production values. Indeed much of the film has the effect of home video footage. This is all well and good, but the poor lighting and hand-held camera work ultimately wore on me. There are some sparks of creativity, particularly in the scenes where the guy flashes back on memories of a previous girlfriend and in the very final scene, but overall the filming is pedestrian.The tentative and delicate nature of the relationship that develops between the guy and girl is touching. The vagaries of human interactions are illustrated well and the ending seemed real to me. I admired the sincerity and determination of the performers - their devotion to their craft came across strongly. Most of this movie consists of performances. And that was the most difficult obstacle to my truly bonding with this movie - I didn't like the music. It struck me as amateurish and something I would not seek out. If you like the music, then this movie will most likely have a stronger appeal to you than it did for me.",7,1,3,2 July 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Satire of the first order
","Quite rarely a movie comes out of nowhere and astounds with its originality. This movie is one such. I think there has never been a more mordant political satire ever filmed, nor hardly ever a better movie, as far as that goes.This movie came out when the cold war between the Soviet Union and the United states was in full swing. I don't recall it ever having been stated as an official policy, but the idea of mutual assured destruction (MAD) was in play--if one country tried to annihilate the other with a nuclear attack, there was enough time for the other to deploy an equally devastating retaliatory attack. This movie captures the absurdity of this situation wherein a single United States general goes nuts and orders a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. If you were not around to experience the fear and anxiety of the time, then this movie should convey a bit of the mood of the era that produced such a film. The concept of a Doomsday device that would be automatically triggered in the event of a nuclear bomb detonation was invented by Herman Kahn in his book, 'On Thermonuclear War,' a book that Kubrick had studied for the film.We have gone beyond the dread of apocalypse accompanying any world conflict and the times when a variety of fallout shelters were sold on lots like car lots, but even now the message here is not totally irrelevant-- someone misinterprets a blip on a radar scene, a missile is launched, retaliation ensues, and we are in dire circumstances. However you are affected by the story you should be able to appreciate the genius of the execution. The black and white photography is used to great effect. The war room, with the 'big board' and the eerily lighted monster conference table, has to be one of the grandest sets ever designed and constructed. Kubrick had a talent for realism as well. The battle scenes where the army tries to take the General's headquarters seemed like documentary footage. And it is hard to believe that the inside of the B-52 was not done inside of a real B-52 (apparently revealing the interior of a B-52 was classified at the time, but those in the know said that Kubrick's presentation was pretty much dead on.) Watching the crew of the B-52 calmly watch their radar screens while a missile tracked them was chilling, and the scene inside the plane when the missile exploded a couple miles away was masterfully done. Every actor turns in a stellar performance, with Peter Sellers a standout in playing three different parts. If you did not know about this triple play, you would have not guessed it. When Sellers first realizes that General Ripper has gone round the bend with his concern about his precious bodily fluids, the expression on Seller's face is priceless.The screenplay is brilliant, presenting characters and situations that are exaggerated, but not totally beyond belief. As one example, consider the discussion about having select people live in mine shafts for a hundred years while waiting out the radioactive fallout. Given the distrust between the two nations you could imagine a General Turgidson worrying that the Soviets may take a bomb down with them into the mines so that when people emerge in a hundred years they would have the advantage.The only minor flaw for me was the scene that has Colonel Bat Guano (if that really was his name) firing into a Coke machine and being sprayed by soda--such slapstick is not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the production.The images on the Blu-ray DVD are crisp as might be expected. The DVD also contains a load of extras, the most interesting being pop-up picture-in-picture interviews and historical information relevant to what is on screen.",10,1,2,24 February 2012
The Best Years of Our Lives," Scripted, but effective
","As long as there are wars, there will be soldiers coming home from them after long absences. And there will be movies like this one that detail what some of those soldier experience. This movie is one of the first, and one of the best, to tackle this sensitive subject. The movie concentrates on three soldiers coming home to a smallish Midwestern city from WWII and it walks a fine line between being too stark (blind and paralyzed) and being overly sunny (parades and public honors). Care is also taken to represent the three main branches of the military: Al is an infantry Sargent, Homer is a Navy seaman, and Fred is an Army Air Corps Captain (the Air Force was not made an official branch of the U.S. Military until 1947). These three had disparate backgrounds before the war: Al was a banker with a wife and two kids; Fred was a soda jerk, recently married; Homer was a middle class guy living with his parents, having a girlfriend next door. The initial scenes are some of the most moving where we see the excitement the guys have in flying over the city in coming back, only to be followed by witnessing the anxiety over what they will find on the home front.After the initial setup the story follows the three soldiers through their initial reentry into a culture they hardly recognize until they are on a path to integration. It's not a one-way street--families and friends also have their share of anxieties and readjustments. Perhaps Homer has the toughest row to hoe, since he lost both hands during the war. You are forced to see the obstacles Homer faces, both physical and emotional. Homer's situation was brought home to me when he took his prosthetic arms off and laid them to the side and commented that if the door to his bedroom closed, he would be as helpless as a baby when it came to getting out. Homer's situation is presented in detail and with much feeling and it makes you think about the daily ordeals any handicapped person faces. I found the acting uniformly good, even non-actor Harold Russell as Homer. I particularly liked Myrna Loy as Al's wife Milly. The banter between Milly and Al sometimes offered a bit of comic relief--Loy's personality that made her so successful in the Thin Man movies breaks through on occasion. The scene that had Fred pretending to sell Al's daughter perfume was funny and charming. But, befitting the subject matter, there is not a whole lot of humor to be had here.The black and white photography is notable. There are some interesting scenes using mirrors. As with many movies from the 40s and 50s the musical score gets a little out of control at times leaving little doubt as to what emotions you should be having.Of interest is the fact that the movie is a bit of a time capsule. I got a feel for the time period in terms of the dress, the cars, the night life, and so forth. The sex appeal of the women in this film withstands the test of time--indeed, maybe less explicit dress is more enticing. The brief footage in the nightclubs of Gene Krupa in one scene and Tennessee Ernie Ford in another was fun to see. And the scene with Hoagy Carmichael playing the piano while counseling Homer to calm down was a pure delight. I wish there had been more of Carmichael. The scene toward the end showing the graveyard for airplanes was sobering and could be seen as a metaphor for what was happening to the three soldiers--what was recently a vital resource was being processed for salvage. This movie might be a little too polished, but I admire it for its courage in taking on a serious topic so soon after the war, and doing so with honesty and style. The themes touched on are no less relevant now than they were then.",10,1,1,30 August 2011
The Town," Too many car chases and shoot-outs
","This movie about a group of four young bank robbers in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston (the town in question) has a lot of good things going for it, but ultimately it does not rise much above being just another heist movie. The leader of the pack is Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) who was essentially born into a life of crime. But when Doug shadows Claire, a potential witness to a robbery, he falls for her. The 'love conquers all' theme then emerges as Doug can see his way to a better life with Claire. The production values are high and the acting is more than good, with Rebecca Hall turning in a fine performance as Claire and Jeremy Renner playing a guy who is a walking danger zone. And there is a great cameo by Chris Cooper as Doug's father.Given all the good things about this film it's too bad that they could not have been orchestrated into a more meaningful whole. I recognize the entertainment value of the movie, but the insane car chases and unbelievable shoot-outs torpedoed the affair for me--instead of heightening the tension, I found them distracting.In these films where the robbers wear unusual masks and many other costumes, you might wonder if a couple of guys buying several ghoulish masks and some nun's habits might raise some red flags. And I should think that some banks might be interested in where Claire got that chunk of money to fund the ice rink for children.",6,0,1,21 March 2011
Taxi Driver," Is this worth seeing?
","This story of a Vietnam vet, Travis Bickle, who becomes increasingly isolated and alienated until he explodes in violence is a fine piece of film-making. When it was over I asked myself if it was worth watching and did not arrive at a definitive 'Yes.'Travis works some of the sleaziest streets of New Your City. He drives his taxi against a backdrop of prostitutes, drug dealers, pimps, porno houses, and various lowlifes. He seems repulsed by what he sees, but in other ways obsessed by it. He tries to make contact with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who is working on a presidential campaign. She initially shows some interest, but on one of their first times together Travis takes her to a porn movie and she is so disgusted she walks out on the movie as well as on Travis. This scene says a lot about Travis' social ineptitude, but it puzzles the viewer as well--if Travis is so turned off by the sordidness he sees, why participate in it? Before going into the movie he tells Betsy that she will like it and that indicates he is not a stranger to such movies; has he been going to them alone? This plays into the repulsion/obsession theme. If the sordidness is what is driving Travis over the edge, why is his first target of violence the presidential candidate? Is it a way at striking back at Betsy's rejection, or just the manifestation of a confused mind? When Travis kills all of the lowlifes at the end, he is basically exonerated and applauded. If he had been successful in executing his first target, the movie would have had an entirely different outcome and audience reaction. In judging Travis it should be kept in mind that he could just as well have been an assassin as an avenger.The acting is terrific. There are some iconic scenes like the taxi emerging from a cloud of steam and DeNiro's 'You lookin' at me,' scene. Jodie Foster turns in a good performance as a twelve-year-old prostitute and Harvey Keitel is perfect as a hopped up pimp. Interestingly, one of the scariest scenes has Scorsese himself playing a contentious fare in Travis' cab, with murder on his mind.The original score by Bernard Herrmann alternates between being evocative of the sad and depressing street scenes and being overly intrusive.I appreciated this as an accomplished work of art, but having been dragged through the hell presented, I was looking for some additional reward or meaning. The storyline of an alienated loner erupting in violence is not exactly breaking news. The one scene that was perhaps the most meaningful to me was between Bickle and his fellow driver 'Wizard' (Peter Boyle). In his inarticulate way Bickle tries to tell Wizard that he is having some real problems and feels like he is going to explode. Wizard basically responds with the 'Hey, everything is going to be OK,' line. Maybe the message is that we should pay closer attention to what people are saying. But it is hard to see what is going to stop Bickle's slide toward the abyss. I would like to have come away with a better understanding of Travis Bickle and his motivations. We know almost nothing of his life before we meet him, except for his tour in Vietnam. Did that contribute to his actions? But maybe the point is that there is no way to truly understand such a man.",7,6,11,11 September 2008
Capote," Philip Seymour Hoffman brings Capote back to life
","When I first saw Truman Capote on one of the late night TV talk shows my reaction to him was, 'Who is this funny, sad, charming, off-putting, self-centered, peculiar little man?' I wondered if he was putting on an act or whether he was for real. Anyone who sees this film understands that he was very much for real. Hoffman, in a stunning performance, captures the essence of Capote. Is it the case that Hoffman may be the best actor to come along since Brando? Capote needed to be the center of attention, he needed to be admired, he needed love. His needs were as great as his ego and such a person is usually vulnerable and winds up being unhappy. This was true for Truman. This movie shows Capote at his peak and then shows him on the precipice of his downhill slide. We are led to believe that Capote's experiences in writing 'In Cold Blood,' his account of the murders of a family of four on a rural Kansas farm, not only raised him to the pinnacle of success as a writer but also contained the seeds of his destruction. The relationship that developed between Capote and Perry Smith, one of the killers, is ambiguous. Capote was a master manipulator and the little pas de deux he does with Smith is fascinating, since Smith himself is not above manipulating Capote. Of course Capote wins that contest, but it is implied that the emotional toll it took on him was significant. He was conflicted by wanting Smith and his accomplice to be hanged, so he could have a final chapter in his book, and by having established a bond with Smith. Journalists have to distance themselves from their subjects because they have to move on and cannot sustain emotional involvements; 'Capote' examines what happens when that rule is disregarded. There are parallels between Capote's career and that of Joeph Mitchell, another writer for the New Yorker (of distinctly different personality), who became close to one of his subjects, one Joe Gould. After achieving success with his articles on Gould, Mitchell never published again. Mitchell's story is detailed in the movie, 'Joe Gould's Secret.' Apparently if a journalist flies too close to the flame he stands to get seriously burned. In the beginning of Capote's last major work 'Unanswered Prayers' (fragments published six years after his death) is 'More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones,' so he was not without introspection.The relationship that Capote had with Harper Lee, as depicted in this movie, gives insight into both of their characters. Lee had a deep understanding of Capote and his self-centered nature, but the relationship meant enough to her to maintain it. There are some good scenes between them. Lee recognized that your typical small town Kansan was probably going to have some trouble dealing with someone as unusual as Capote and she runs interference for him on occasion by dealing with people that Truman would not have been able to get to first base with. One has to wonder if 'In Cold Blood' could ever have been written without Lee's accompanying Capote to Kansas. Her presence in the movie is certainly an added attraction. She could be brutally honest with Capote on occasion, but, as with most everyone, he seemed rather oblivious to what she said or did.In one scene Capote is shown reading selections from 'In Cold Blood' to a large New York audience. He revels in the applause after the reading - you can sense him purring like a cat. This is an important scene in that it shows what a beautiful writer Capote was and why he was justly famous for his writing. This scene is so wonderfully filmed, from being backstage before Capote's entrance to the rousing standing ovation at the end, it is transfixing.With the exception of Bob Balaban, who gives a rather uninspired performance as Wallace Shawn, the editor of the New Yorker, the supporting cast is excellent. Chris Cooper turns in another fine performance.The score is suitably subdued and not without merit.This film is an altogether impressive work.",10,1,1,7 February 2006
Lost in Translation," Entertaining, but functions on deeper levels
","There are a lot of things at the surface level in this movie that make it quite entertaining, but it functions at deeper levels as well.Some of the humor is up front, like the visual effects regarding the height differences between Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and the average Japanese shown when he is in a crowded elevator or adjusting a shower head. Or the Japanese TV show that he appears on that is way over the top, and the scary thing being that I think it may be for real. There are a lot of little one-liners like when Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) tells Bob that she has a degree in philosophy and he says, 'Lots of money there.' For those of us who have not been to Japan, this movie also serves as somewhat of a travelogue. The Tokyo scenes convince me that I don't want to go there - its neon jungle is isolating and repellent. It puts Las Vegas to shame. The video arcade that Charlotte visits is so outrageous that it creates a strange fascination. One of my favorite scenes is the dance a young Japanese boy is doing with his video game - his movements are so fluid and perfectly timed that it is almost a ballet. The sensual assault of the City is put to good use in its effect on the two protagonists - they are alone in a strange land and the looks on their faces as they drive through the City give evidence to their isolation. However, there are oases of grace as when Charlotte visits a temple or a beautiful garden, or the kaleidoscopic effect of multiply colored umbrellas carried on a busy walkway.The heart of the movie is the affectionate relationship that develops between Bob and Charlotte. It develops at a gradual pace and it is perfectly believable. There is a sexual tension between them tempered by a respectful restraint. You get hints about their deepening feelings rather than being hit over the head with it. Bob decides to stay for an extra day to do an interview on a TV show that he really does not want to do and he has a one-night stand with another woman, more his age, but keeps his sexual distance from the younger Charlotte.The obvious meaning of the title applies to the cultural and language challenges anyone faces in visiting a foreign country where he does not speak the language. But a deeper meaning of the title applies to the inability of friends and spouses to understand and listen to each other. Charlotte's husband is a self-centered ass who has no real interest in what his wife is saying, or what she feels or thinks. He is too busy on an ego trip with his career. Charlotte calls a friend of hers back in the States and tries to have a conversation, but soon gets a 'Gotta run.' And Charlotte is not the great communicator either - when asked how things are going she says it's great, when in fact she is lonely and bored. Bob experiences very similar interactions on the phone with his wife. She is more interested in his choice of tile color than what he is thinking. But there are times when Bob and Charlotte do talk, and that is one of the things that attracts them to each other. In the final event, though he is tempted to stay, in an act of acceptance of reality Bob leaves to go back to his family. There is that famous final scene where he whispers something into Charlotte's ear (which is not even subtitled) and they part - he aggrieved and she with a smile. I think he simply offered Charlotte thanks and encouragement that she would find her way in life.Bill Murray is perfect for the part of an aging actor on the downward slope who is hawking a whiskey for sizable money (Orson Welles comes to mind). The beauty of his acting here is in his reaction shots portraying a mildly depressed middle-aged man who is struggling to deal with a crazy world. At the end you are wanting to know more about Bob and Charlotte - more about their pasts and their futures.And what was with that golf scene?",8,0,1,10 December 2005
Barry Lyndon," A perfectionist director comes close to achieving his goal
","Common opinion has it that this is perhaps the most exquisitely beautiful film ever made. It is certainly the most beautiful I have seen. After the first half hour I was doubtful if the level of quality could be maintained throughout; it was. The story takes place in the second half of the eighteenth century and traces the history of one Redmond Barry, a man of modest birth who rises to marry a baroness, Lady Lyndon, only to later lose it all. This comment is not a spoiler, since a narrator frequently tells us what is about to happen and the on-screen titles:Part I. By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon.Part II. Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon. take away any major suspense.The story is told in a series of episodes, each one perfectly composed and paced. I am in awe of how much time must have gone into making this. The research on period details and dress had to be extensive. The battle scene between the English and French armies was stunning, involving hundreds of actors all dressed in full uniform. This reminded me of the battle scene in 'Spartacus' between Spartacus and the Roman armies of Crassus, only the armies had rifles this time around. Kubrick knows how to stage such scenes--the battle scene is just one of many I watched again after having seen the whole movie. It is not surprising that there are long time gaps between Kubrick movies.This is one of the few movies that fully engaged me even though I did not have a strong emotional commitment to the main characters. I was captivated by a presentation that has the feel of a dispassionate scientific investigation, it's like I was viewing specimens under a microscope. In witnessing the arc of Barry's entire life the movie drives home how we are all shaped by random events and our emotions, neither of which we have much control of. As the narrator asks, what would Barry's life have been if he had not fallen for Nora? What if he had been able to control his behavior toward Lord Bullingdon? Questions we all ask ourselves: what would my life have been if I had done this, or not done that, or if some event had not happened? Ryan Oneal does not have an enormous range as an actor, but he is well cast in his role here, since Barry is externally passive. This is not to say that he is emotionless: he precipitated a duel over his love for Nora, he came to the aid of a comrade in battle, he loved his son, he violently attacked Lord Bullingdon and fired into the ground as a point of honor in his duel with Bullingdon. I was impressed by how well Oneal carried off the boxing scene, later to find out that he had been an amateur boxer as a younger man.The musical score plays an essential role; the movie would lose much of its impact without it. Period classical pieces are perfectly chosen to enhance the experience. After having seen this movie who will ever forget the Andante movement from Schubert's Piano Trio no. 2, or the Sarabande from Handel's Keyboard Suite in D minor?Kubrick cannot be accused of producing movies that are variations on a theme--every one is a unique work of art. It is hard to imagine what current director would have what it takes to gamble on making a visionary movie like 'Barry Lyndon.' The only movie in recent memory that I can think of that could be in this category is Malick's, 'Tree of Life.'",10,5,8,9 October 2012
Lion," See it, even if you know the story
","I saw the '60 Minutes' segment about the true story behind this movie and was thinking I would skip it for that reason, but given the good ratings it has gotten, I decided to give it a shot. I found the dramatization got me much more emotionally involved than the documentary.This story of Saroo Brierly is presented in two parts, separated by 25 years. As the young Saroo, age five, the movie is immeasurably helped by the outstanding performance by the endearing Sunny Pawar. The risk of having a first time young actor carry half of a major movie paid off. It seems that the quality of child actors and young actors has improved impressively in recent years. I am thinking of the three kids in 'The Tree of Life,' for example.The older Saroo is played by Dev Patel, who was nominated for an Oscar for actor in a supporting role. Nicole Kidman was nominated for best actress in a supporting role for her portrayal of Saroo's foster mother in Australia. The movie itself got a total of six Oscar nominations, so it comes with credentials.This is somewhat of a travelogue with scenes being filmed in various places in India, West Bengal, and Australia (particularly Tasmania). The artful cinematography of Greig Fraser (also an Oscar nominee) adds much to the impact of the movie.I think anyone who had a happy childhood and moved away from where he or she grew up always has nostalgia for the place of their beginning. With maturity also comes the desire to know one's ancestors, to know where you came from. Those two themes infuse this story to the extent that most audiences should be able to establish a strong emotional identification with Saroo.Be sure to stay to the end where footage of the real life people is shown.",8,0,2,1 March 2017
Forrest Gump," A travesty
","There are many ways that this movie turned my stomach. The idea that a mentally challenged man can achieve such successes in life pushed me way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief. Just one example among many: was I supposed to believe that Gump could be a successful football player on the University of Alabama team? How did he even get into the university? Given the tone of the movie I doubt that this was meant as a sarcastic comment on the intelligence of college football players, but that is how I saw it. It's an insult to real players who have worked hard to get on a team.All right, so I should just view this as some feel-good fantasy, yes? But there were some scenes that were played for real: Gump's buddy in the Vietnam war being fatally shot in the guts, his girl friend dying of AIDS, his mother dying of cancer. Such mixtures of realism and fantasy have never worked for me.Putting the above matters aside, there are more serious concerns. The message of this movie, that being mentally challenged is only a minor impediment to achieving great successes in life, is objectionable. How are parents dealing with the real problems that mentally challenged children have in this world supposed to react to this message? Or the mentally challenged themselves? Or everybody else for that matter.I was highly offended by this movie.",1,12,26,14 March 2014
Gone Baby Gone," Raises significant questions
","This movie plays as a police procedural and thriller, but what propels it are the underlying moral questions it asks. Is it all right to kill (well, actually murder) a depraved pedophile who himself has just killed a seven year old boy? Is diverting captured drug money to a good cause acceptable? Is it better to return an abducted four year old child to her drug-addicted excuse for a mother, or clandestinely spirit her away to a better home? These are some of the questions faced by private investigator Patrick Kenzie and his partner, and lover, Angie Gennaro as they investigate the disappearance of a small girl from a lower-class Boston neighborhood.Director Affleck clearly has a feel for the rhythms, and sometimes even the beauty, of this Boston neighborhood which provides an authentic backdrop for the story. But the proceedings are convoluted and ultimately not believable. Did all of the (well-meaning) conspirators really think that they could get away with their plans?Ed Harris turns in a dramatic performance as a cop working with Kenzie; Michelle Monaghan is fine as Kenzie's partner, although she is not given much to do; Morgan Freeman has limited screen time and, at this point in his career, he can toss off a performance like this as easily as Tiger Woods makes birdies. Then we come to Casey Affleck. I think he has a chance of being one of our better actors, but I felt he was miscast here. He has a unique screen presence that suggests powerful emotions beneath his controlled exterior. Some have complained of his mumbling, but that speech pattern seemed appropriate to me. What I had a hard time with was his youthful, preppy appearance that stood in stark contrast to his tough guy character who was on congenial terms with a number of bad-asses. The film tried to exploit this disconnect, but it didn't work for me, since Casey Afleck projects no menace. I think this role calls for someone like a De Niro or Nicholson.",7,2,3,30 July 2008
The Aviator," Overcooked and lacking in nourishment
","I admired this for its high production values but was disappointed that it is pitched more as an entertainment than as providing any insights into Howard Hughes the man. One test I have for film biographies is whether I get more understanding from the film than reading a Wikipedia article. This movie failed that test for me, since it did not give me any better understanding of Hughes than I had before seeing it. Hughes had an interesting career and personal life with many irons in the fire in both spheres. Maybe his life is too rich to be covered in a single movie that can go beyond hitting the high points of his work in movies, his aviation achievements, and more than a hint of his romances.Leonard DiCaprio gives it his best, but I feel he did not capture the essence of the man. In any archival footage of Hughes that I have seen he evinces a charisma and intelligence that I did not get from DiCaprio's performance. I found Hughes was presented here as rather one-dimensional, always barking orders and instructing his assistant to mortgage everything to support his current passion. Hughes wound up as one of the wealthiest men in the United States, but I never got a feel from this movie as to how he amassed his fortune--he had to be more of a cunning businessman than what we are given here. As much as I like Cate Blanchett, I found her portrayal of Katharine Hepburn created more of a caricature than a character. She got close on the voice, but I have to believe that Hepburn was a more serious person than the flippant and shallow person created. Best for Scorsese that Hepburn never saw this movie as I am sure she would have ripped him to shreds. Alan Alda, as U.S. Senator Brewster, is the only actor whose performance engaged me. The battle of egos between Brewster and Hughes provided a spark, missing in most other scenes.Hints of the obsessive compulsive disorder that was to ravage Hughes in later life are dropped along the way, like his wanting his peas served in a 4x4 matrix and being upset when someone disturbed the symmetry. I found it curious that nobody ever directly addressed this, either to Hughes or to friends, early on. I think that most people who saw a friend behaving this way would be concerned and bring it up as odd enough to be of concern long before the sickness reached a level where it could no longer be ignored.There are some spectacular shots of planes of the era. The scene where Hughes crashed an XF-11 into a Los Angeles neighborhood is rendered in harrowing detail. The mock-up of the Spruce Goose (which in fact was made primarily of birch) was wonderfully realized.I quickly tired of the exaggeration for effect, like Hughes burning all his clothes on the floor of his house and letting Hepburn fly his plane over Los Angeles at night when she had never flown before. The scenes in the nightclub were so amped up in order to create a sense of chaos and frenzy that they were unbelievable, capped off by a band leader who was ridiculously gesticulating like a mad man.This is a passable entertainment, but disappointing, given the effort put into it and the fact that it comes from Scorsese.",5,2,4,10 September 2012
The Battle of Algiers," An anatomy of an occupation and revolution
","This movie about the Algerian's fight for independence from over one hundred years of French occupation is a serious undertaking. If you are looking for a pleasant evening's entertainment, then you should put off seeing this until you are in a more solemn mood.When I found out that there was no documentary footage shown I was stunned since some of the scenes seem so real, particularly the crowd scenes that usually look so staged when not real. It is to the film's credit that it does not appear to take sides between the occupiers or the revolutionaries, but maintains the appearance of just reporting what happened.I came away from this with a better understanding of the minds of terrorists and how they operate, and that is much to be desired at this particular time, since the applications to current situations are so plentiful. Though there are but a few scenes of explicit torture, they provide a way to take the consideration of those practices from the abstract to the explicit.The film does leave some significant unanswered questions. Why, after over a hundred years of French occupation did the Algerian resistance coalesce so dramatically in the late 1950s? At the inception of the resistance one of the Frenchman even minimizes it with the comment that the French and Algerians have gotten along for over a century, so why should that not continue? And after the uprising had seemingly been put down, after a two-year hiatus what caused the overwhelming popular uprising that resulted in Algerian independence in 1962?After the final scene you are left to think that things are going to be great for the Algerians, but the subsequent history of that country is not all that inspiring.All of this is not to say that this important movie is a bitter pill to swallow only for its educational values - it has elements of suspense, conflict, and violence to keep your interest.",10,0,1,2 February 2008
Disturbia," 'Rear Window' for the iPod generation
","This story of a young man confined to the property boundaries of his house and taking to spying on his neighbors and suspecting one of them of foul play has obvious similarities with the Hitchock classic 'Rear Window.' However, this movie reminded me more of 'WarGames' than 'Rear Window,' with Shia LaBeouf taking the role of Matthew Broderick and Sarah Roemer taking the role of Ally Sheedy. All four of those young actors are likable and attractive and the two males are hip to the technology of the time, which is a major element in both movies. But, whereas the future of the world hangs in the balance in 'WarGames' and questions are raised about our dependence on our machines and their vulnerabilities, what we finally get in 'Disturbia' is simply an overly-long and unbelievable cat and mouse game played between the bad guy and LaBeouf.All of this is unfortunate since the first half of this movie is quite well done. The auto accident at the beginning is exceedingly realistic and unexpected and was for me the most disturbing thing in the film. LaBeouf is presented as such a stereotypical upper-middle-class, tech-savvy adolescent that I wish there had been just one thing about him that did not conform to that image. For example, given how closely he was following the SUV ahead of him before the accident I think a case could have been made that he was responsible for his father's death and this potential aspect of his psychology was never examined. Having been confined to stay within the lot lines of his house and having had his mom disconnect his Xbox and TV, what was he doing for all those hours alone in his room when he was not spying on his neighbors? I wanted this guy to have some definable personality beyond being a likable young man.It's odd that people who have things to hide don't seem to value curtains.Not a bad movie, it just falters in its last act.",6,0,2,15 January 2008
The Machinist," Unrelentingly bleak
","Take the colors in your typical machine shop and apply them to an entire movie and you have set the tone for 'The Machinist.' If you want to spend a couple of hours with a tortured soul and see things like a man getting his hand ripped off in a machine, then this movie is for you. I don't think I have ever seen a better depiction of paranoia in a film, for what that's worth. I was so distracted by Bale's physical appearance that it was difficult to watch him. I have to question what it was about the script that excited him to make such a personal sacrifice. It's too bad there wasn't a Holocaust movie being made at the time so that he could have doubled the gain for his effort. Indeed 'The Machinist' would not have had its fascination without Bale's skeletal form, but you have to question if this was worth his effort.This is the kind of movie that you are afraid to recommend for fear of incurring the disapproval and suspicions of your friends.",7,1,2,1 August 2006
The Usual Suspects," Stylish crime drama with little content
","[**Major spoilers**] This movie began on a sour note in the opening scene with a man on an upper floor pissing down onto a ribbon of flaming gasoline on a lower floor to put it out. Right off we know that there is going to have to be some major suspension of disbelief. The story line is not nearly as complicated as it is made out to be. Within the context of this movie, maybe that was a goal. I never did figure out what the deal was with the image of the rope heading into a rat's nest of junk that was shown several times.A real problem for me was that the two main thugs in this were not at all threatening. The final plot twist only furthered this dissonance - it was kind of like finding out that behind the mask of Darth Vader we find Pee-wee Herman. And I felt manipulated by the final twist (that was in fact somewhat anticipated, after all Verbal was smoking his cigarette in the Turkish style). Are we to believe that Verbal boarded the boat and changed into a fedora and black overcoat to perform the crucial murder? What was the point of that besides trying to fool the audience? And so many times in the exchanges between Verbal and Kujan, I felt I was watching actors rather than characters.The bottom line on this movie is that it is no more than a tricked out episode of 'Law and Order' without offering anything substantial to think about after it's over.",6,42,61,6 February 2006
No Country for Old Men," Multifaceted
","The focus of this complex film is on an aging Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell, who is working on the case of a drug deal that has gone very bad indeed--it has left several people dead and two million dollars up for grabs. When there is that kind of money on the loose there most likely will be several parties interested in its recovery, and here we have Llewelyn Moss (who accidentally happens on the money), a band of Mexicans (who delivered the dope), business investors, bounty hunters, and one Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). All of these characters play an intricate cat and mouse game, but the three main players are Moss, Bell, and Chigurh. The film has higher aspirations than being a typical crime thriller. It touches on the role that evil and fate play in our lives. These themes are particularized in the personal experiences of Ed Bell who can stand in for anyone who is old enough to remember a time when astonishing acts of violence seemed rare. At the scene of the drug deal Ed has witnessed a brutal massacre and he subsequently tries to track down Chigurh, one of the most amoral and evil killers ever put on the screen. Chigurh is particularly scary since he is intelligent and not obviously crazy.Ed is astonished by what he perceives as a rise in a type of violence which he does not understand nor know how to deal with. He relates a gruesome story out of California that truly dumbfounds him, a story that provokes a laugh from his younger deputy. The rather downbeat message is that in the face of evil most people try to ignore it and go about their daily lives, but people like Ed feel overwhelmed and come to regard themselves as helpless bystanders. Perhaps the older one gets the more societal changes in the United States encourage one to feel like Ed, hence the title of the movie.The location shots in west Texas are beautifully filmed. It is a harsh and spare landscape which has shaped the local inhabitants, they are direct and sparing of words. Whether you like this film will depend greatly on whether you like the lean dialog and deliberate pacing. For example, when Bell goes to visit his friend (relative?) Ellis he asks 'How you been Ellis?' and gets the response, 'You're looking at it.' By appearances, Ellis is not doing too well. When Ellis makes the comment, 'I got to say, you're looking older,' Bell replies, 'I am older.' These lines are delivered with perfect pitch. But there is more substantial conversation. Ellis comments, 'Well, all the time you spend trying to get back what's been took from you, more is going out the door.' This pivotal scene between Bell and Ellis is a wondrous piece of work, accomplished actors delivering great dialog.Then there is Javier Bardem who probably deserved his Oscar. What a versatile actor. Compare his performance in this movie with those in 'The Sea Inside,' and 'Before Night Falls,' and you become a believer in his talents. All the actors are perfectly cast.The musical score is minimal and that seems to greatly accentuate the tension. There are some classic scenes such as the exchange between Chigurh and a gas station attendant where a life depends on a coin toss. I am sure existentialists could make much of that scene. When he is not out for a deliberate kill Chigurh likes to play the game of tossing a coin to determine life or death. In the abstract Chigurh could represent the role of fate in our lives: an uncontrollable force lurking out there just waiting to change our lives in some unpredictable way. Chigurh himself is ultimately the victim of such a fateful event.The final scene is powerful. After telling of a dream where his father appeared as protector and safety icon Bell comes back to reality to realize that he has no such protector and in fact is no longer of much use in this world, not even to his wife. When he realizes this his look of anguish is agonizing to watch.I have see seven of the Coen brothers movies (including 'Fargo') and this is the only one that has truly engaged me.",10,1,3,5 September 2008
The Chorus," A variation on the theme of inspiring teacher
","Not as common as underdog sports teams overcoming obstacles to achieve success, stories of teachers bucking the odds to great positive effect seem to be perennial favorites. This film about a recently-hired school supervisor, Clément Mathieu, at a French reform school for boys in 1949 is one more entry in the exceptional teacher genre. For many of us the appeal of these films is that we have had such a teacher in our lives.The school, named Fond de l'Etang (literally 'bottom of the pond'), houses an impressive collection of rowdy boys, some orphaned or otherwise scarred by the war. The headmaster is a harsh disciplinarian whereas Clémeant is more gentle and reasoned in his approach. About all you need to know about the story is that, in this particular case, the inspiring teacher accomplishes his noteworthy achievements by way of forming a choir. Not all is sweetness as there is one rather incorrigible boy, Mondain (Grégory Gatignol, who establishes a truly scary presence) introduced into the mix. It is interesting to compare this movie with 'Blackboard Jungle' where Glenn Ford faces a somewhat similar situation. The gritty realism of 'Blackboard Jungle' is in stark contrast to what we see in 'Les Choristes,' leaving one to puzzle about how a Hollywood film from 1955 has more depth than a French film from 2004.Jacques Perrin adds some nice touches in his brief appearances - he does a particularly fine job as an orchestra conductor in an early scene. After Clément whips the choir into shape they perform some stunningly beautiful pieces. Maybe they are unbelievably good, but that does not detract from being able to enjoy their performances. I replayed the last ten minutes of the movie several times just to listen to the chorus.This is a sentimental and predictable film, but nicely done.",8,2,2,6 August 2007
The Pianist," Almost flawless, but should you see it?
","This is an excellent, almost flawless movie.  Its realism makes it painful to watch.  If you are already convinced of the horror of the holocaust, then I am not sure that the emotional drain this intense experience will cost you will be worth it to you.  I am still trying to recover from it a day later.  I think some of the images in the film will stay with me for a long time.  There is no sugarcoating here, as in 'Life is Beautiful.'  The seriousness of the approach is appropriate to the topic.If you need any convincing of the horror of the holocaust, then this movie should provide that convincing for you. It is autobiography as history lesson.  I would expect that you will better appreciate food on your table for awhile after having seen this movie.",9,0,1,22 February 2003
Revolutionary Road," Sharp dialog in a movie about a marriage gone awry
","It's the 1950s in the United States and Frank and April Wheeler meet, marry, have two kids and purchase a picturesque house in the suburbs. This attractive young couple seems headed for a realization of the America Dream, but they understand too late the compromises that they must accept to get there. Frank is in marketing for Knox Business Machines where he goes every day dressed in a suit and tie, wearing his fedora. Sitting in his cubicle day after day he comes to feel that this is not what he had in mind for his life. Meanwhile, on the home front April is feeling the boredom of the daily routine intensely oppressive. Instead of admitting that maybe life is not going to turn out to be as glamorous as envisioned in some unspecified fantasy, April has the idea that she and Frank can break out of their perceived drab existence by moving to Paris. She convinces Frank of this idea and right then you know that rough times are probably ahead, since neither of them has the ability to think far enough ahead to see what such a move would entail. They have arrived at one of those node points in a relationship that, once a big idea is on the table, and under serious consideration, it's going to be difficult to back off of it or go forward with it, particularly if the idea is not supported equally. Maybe Frank and April's experiment could have been performed, but when the complications of a promotion for Frank and April's pregnancy arise you realize that the marriage is probably doomed. This is a film where you drop in on some people and get to know them well and see the tragic consequences of their decisions. Frank and April get so deep into their misadventure that they can't right the ship by the time they grasp their situation. There is some keenly observed dialog, like Frank's comment, 'Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without - That's inventory control.' The actors are up to the task with the highlight being Michael Shannon playing John Givins, a truth-telling ex-mathematician who is suffering from something like Asperberger's syndrome. His dialog is so trenchant that you have to recoil from it in sympathy with Frank and April. When Givins pointed to April's obvious pregnancy and said, 'I'm glad I'm not going to be that kid,' I was stunned that someone could dream up such a cutting remark.The period details like autos, furniture, dress, and street scenes are strikingly well done. While Frank and April's story may have been more common in the 50s, it could easily be translated into a contemporary setting, except for one crucial detail. In contemporary America April could have made a case for a legal second trimester abortion under a doctor's care, based on her mental health. I don't know the intent of the book, but this film makes a case for pro-choice.There are things to be learned from watching this. If you are on the path to marriage, then it can be a cautionary tale; for all others, it can prompt candid reflection on where you are and where you are going.",9,0,0,5 November 2009
Foxcatcher," Not much to it
","(spoilers) The story details the relationship between multi-millionaire John DuPont and the Schultz brothers (Mark and Dave), world class wrestlers. DuPont was interested in promoting wrestling, particularly in promoting Mark in world championships and then in the 1988 Olympics. DuPont established an upscale wrestling training facility on his extravagant estate in Pennsylvania, called Foxcatcher. After enticing Mark to train at Foxcatcher DuPont was set on getting Dave to come as well. There was a big build-up about DuPont wanting Dave and Dave not wanting to come, but then all of a sudden Dave shows up with no explanation given.I think there are two things that attract an audience to this movie. One is seeing Steve Corell in a dramatic role and the other is the knowledge of the tragic ending. It *is* a surprise to see Corell in this movie and almost immediately my reaction to his performance of DuPont was 'creepy.' But Corell never gets away from a one-note interpretation. Obviously DuPont was slipping into some serious mental state by the time he murdered Dave, but Corell plays DuPont the same throughout. Corell has received kudos for getting DuPont right, but if you look at the YouTube video of DuPont (google 'DuPont video') I find the DuPont there to have much more of a normal vocal range and appear to be somewhat normal, albeit a bit idiosyncratic, in his interpersonal behaviors. Also, he is much more physically fit than Corell. Can you picture Corell's DuPont enjoying a fishing trip? There is heavy focus on Corell's large nose (exaggerated from DuPont's real nose, if you look at photos of DuPont). Corell must have felt that he need have done no more than show up with this nose in order for his performance to be highly rated. At every possible opportunity Corell is filmed in profile. If Corell's performance is unvarying, Channing Tatum's, as Mark, is not much better. His performance consists of a deliberate walk, a worried look, and a monotone voice. The word automaton comes to mind.The only actors who have any screen presence are Mark Ruffalo, as Dave, and Vanessa Redgrave (in a cameo performance), as DuPont's mother. Without Ruffalo this affair would have been quite tedious.There is a goodly amount of wrestling footage, both training and competition. If you don't find that sport particularly appealing, then you will likely feel the urge to fast forward over that footage.The score, which frequently is no more than an ominous low note, is effective only if you know that there is going to be a tragic end.In summary, what you have is: the novelty of Carell in a dramatic role, the grotesquerie of the nose, some wrestling footage, and a murder. Not enough to compel my full attention for two hours.I think a documentary about DuPont would be more interesting than this movie. For all his creepyness, he was a complex character with diverse interests and talents; his contributions as a philanthropist were significant.",4,0,1,19 September 2015
City of God," Frantic, violent, and depressing
","Movies such as this present a problem for me in trying to rate them. I recognize the quality in just about every category, but I don't feel that I got a return on the emotional commitment I made to the story, about life in a Rio de Janeiro slum.There are many who seem to have little patience for slow-paced films, but I had the opposite problem with this movie. The camera rarely stays still for more than a few seconds. Even though that probably set the appropriate mood, given the subject matter, it was too manic for me. On first viewing I was so busy reading the subtitles that a second viewing was necessary to fill in a lot of missed details.The movie does bristle with creative energy. The telling of the story is ingenious. It starts at a point, moves to several flashbacks, gets back to the starting point, and then moves on. There is a main narrator, but many scenes are woven into the story more than once, each time filmed from a different point of view.The violence is unrelenting and intense. Just as one example, there is a scene where a gang member is instructed to shoot one of two young boys to prove his manhood, this after both boys had been shot in the foot for amusement. And then one of the boys is indeed killed. So, if you are thinking of watching this movie, that is the kind of violence to expect. The body count is high. A couple of scenes, like the big dance, hint at a spirited life that is going on behind the scenes, in spite of the grim backdrop. But the emphasis stays on the culture of drugs and violence.When enduring such an intense experience as this, I hope for some personally redeeming value. Yes, one man does escape from the poverty and hopelessness, but that is but one from many. Based on a true story the film makes a strong point about the pernicious effects of poverty, and we are led to understand that the cycle continues from one generation to the next, becoming more desperate and vicious with the passage of time. Not living in Rio or Brazil, where one might feel prompted to act, the movie left me feeling depressed and powerless. About the only good that I could see coming out of it for me was to increase my donations to the local homeless shelter.",8,0,2,18 February 2007
The Theory of Everything," Well done, lacks depth
","Based on a book written by Hawking's first wife Jane this is a straightforward telling of her relationship with Steven Hawking from their first meeting to their parting. There is no need to worry about getting bogged down with cosmological arcana, since there are few details given as to what Hawking's fame as a scientist rests on. Some mention of black holes being mathematical singularities, that they may emit radiation and ultimately disappear, that maybe the creation of our universe could possibly be traced back to a singularity. I suppose this level of detail is appropriate for a movie targeting a general audience--those wanting more can attempt to read Hawking's 'A Brief History of Time.'In popular culture Hawking is more well known for his decades long struggle with ALS than for his contributions to cosmology. The first part of the movie detailing the initial relationship between Steven and Jane is affecting, accentuated by the knowledge of what is to come. As well done as it is this prelude doesn't break much new ground--the story of two attractive young people falling in love is not a neglected topic. The main thrust of the movie concentrates on Hawking's disease and how that was handled by him and Jane as the disease progressed. I have to give Redmayne credit for his impressive performance, I hope he did not suffer any permanent physical damage from the contortions required by the part. Hawking has himself said that the movie gets things right, in the main. I just wish that it could have delved a little deeper. For example, touching on Hawking's thoughts on politics, religion, culture, and issues faced by the disabled, would have made this more interesting. Hawking's atheism was pretty much whitewashed. I suppose citing his quote that heaven is a myth for those afraid of the dark would have been out of place in the guarded approach taken here. There were some odd scenes like the one that has Hawking on stage later in life getting out of his wheelchair to pick up a pen that a woman in the audience had dropped. Whose fantasy was that? To what end was it in there?This is a polished production, maybe too polished. I had the feeling that, like dark matter, we didn't see a lot of details that we know must be there.",7,1,1,22 April 2015
The Lives of Others," Outstanding
","Artists are dangerous to dictatorships as this film so ably proves. A work of art, such as this film about life in the GDR, has the power to influence opinion in a way that history books cannot. In the interview with director Donnersmarck on the DVD extras he mentions that he spent a year and a half doing research for this. He read everything he could on the GDR and conducted extensive interviews with former GDR people, including ex-Stasi agents. Many of the actors are East Germans including Ulrich Mühe who was himself under surveillance by the Stasi. All of this reflects Donnersmark's stated desire for authenticity, down to using original surveillance equipment and filming some of the final scenes in the actual Stasi archives. In any case, if we were to abstract this story from any basis in reality and view it as fiction, it is still powerful. By concentrating on a few individuals it presents a chilling view of the effects of living in a repressive dictatorship. I found this movie to have a keener effect on me than Wells' '1984.'The movie poses the question of what a good man is to do when living in a fascist regime. Those who wield the power have the techniques down as to how to control the citizenry - threats to family, threats to job, brutal interrogation, and even torture. If someone knows enough about you, it is a trivial matter to exploit your vulnerabilities to keep you in line. How much would you compromise? How much would you risk in order to be true to yourself? The most fascinating aspect of this film for me deals with the moral dilemmas faced by its two main protagonists - the theater director and writer Georg Dreyman and the Stasi agent Hauptmann Wiesler who sets up full surveillance on Dreyman. Both are torn between loyalties to their professions, their county, their friends, and ultimately each to his own conscience. Mühe plays Wiesler with subtlety - he turns in an awesome performance primarily achieved through facial expression and body movement. His gradual transformation is wonderful to behold and there is enough ambiguity to keep you guessing as to the causes. Does his surveillance of Dreyman provoke jealousy, sympathy, sexual longings, shame, enlightenment, all of these, or what? And Dreyman's transformation is no less interesting, albeit more easily understood. If you like movies where events change people, you will like this.The colors are a bit drab - grays, greens, and browns. But they reflect an implied drabness as to what life was like in the GDR. I wish there were more commentaries on IMDb from those who lived through this. The musical score offers a perfect backdrop.'The Lives of Others' is absorbing and virtually flawless.",10,6,9,20 October 2007
Dog Day Afternoon," Character study and social commentary
","The opening montage of New York City scenes on a hot summer's day quickly establishes time and place. On that hot summer day Sonny, Sal, and Stevie decide to rob a small Brooklyn bank. When Sal (John Cazale) walks into a bank, pulls an automatic weapon from his attaché case and points it at the bank manager, you think that this is going to be just another heist movie, but it quickly turns into something quite different. The first hint we get of this is when Stevie starts getting 'bad vibes.' When Sonny argues with him that the crime is already underway, but Stevie leaves the scene, you realize then that these three guys are complete amateurs.What sets this movie apart from other heist movies is that it really isn't about the robbery, it's about the characters, mainly Sonny and Sal. Sonny is presented as a complex person. He can be kind-hearted, on the one hand, worrying about whether his hostages are hungry for example, but on the other hand he can explode in anger. His reason for the robbery was to fund a sex change operation for his homosexual lover. And, oh, Sonny is also married with children. Getting to know Sal is a different matter. Cazale plays him as a withdrawn loner who could easily kill without remorse. The FBI quickly sizes up the situation, tagging Sonny as someone they could probably deal with, but recognizing Sal as a true menace. Absent Sal this movie could almost be seen as a satiric comedy; with Sal, a dark cloud hangs over the proceedings.The movie offers some searing commentary on the media and its effect on behavior. During the course of the day television stations are on the ground and in the air with almost continuous coverage. The accounting of the effect the media has on behavior is perceptive. Sonny gets a charge from playing to the crowds and being on TV and being paid attention to. The crows are more than happy to participate in the spectacle and the hostages are so taken with having their fifteen minutes of fame that one woman did not even take the opportunity to escape when she had the chance. Sad to say that in the decades since this movie was made, things have only gotten worse with personal interest stories and personalities dominating the news cycles. So, the social behaviors pointed out are so well established by 2011 that this movie is dated in that respect.The opening text stating that this is a true story is misleading; it is not a documentary. For example, in the real event Sal was a volatile eighteen year old. 'Based on a true story' would be a more accurate description.Some scenes stretched my belief. Would Sonny actually give his gun over to a hostage and try to teach her how to present arms? Would the dangerous Sal be so easily convinced to point his weapon away from the FBI agent driving the limo?",8,0,0,12 July 2011
Amadeus," The casting of Hulce was a problem for me.
","I am sure that casting Tom Hulce as Mozart was a great risk, but unfortunately that was the main thing that kept me from enjoying this movie. It wasn't all Hulce's fault, since there was a decision to have him insert an exceedingly irritating cackle at pretty much random points. Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run. Hulce's attempts to act as an orchestra conductor were on a par with what you would expect from some untutored middle school student, what with gesticulations that mainly just kept the beat. Mozart was a musical genius who challenged the hidebound opinions of the times as to what was deemed acceptable. In that he is little different from early rock-and-roll stars. As presented he was a young, brash, free spirit (so at least the audience was spared the ponderous, agonized artist trope) with few endearing qualities. Granted, there seems to have been a large disparity between Mozart the person and his incredible music, but I cannot believe that he was quite the fool as what is seen here; the personality set forth was not credible to me. If only we had a time machine.There are some good things, like a couple of good performances. F. Murry Abraham is a standout in his subtle portrayal of Antonio Salieri. In this movie Salieri is a tragic figure. He was a popular and respected musician in the court of Emperor Joseph II. Beethoven and Schubert were among his students and I think Salieri gets somewhat of a bum rap in this movie. Solieri's torture was to recognize the difference between his talents and the pure genius of Mozart causing a serious conflict between jealousy and awe. I have seen this scenario played out in the workplace and it would have worked out for the best if the inferior party had just accepted that he was out-gunned; the results were unfortunate, as with Salieri. I thought that Jeffery Jones was particularly effective as Emperor Joseph II. He could walk the fine line between haughtiness and genuine feeling with aplomb.The staging of the opera segments is brilliant. In fact a movie with just extended opera segments, so presented, would be a treasure. As appropriate, Mozart's music plays a central role. But they never let it play for any decent length of time. Particularly irritating was the interruption of the staging of the final scene of 'The marriage of Figaro' with a voice-over from Salieri. Couldn't they at least spare a few minutes to let the audience appreciate one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written? If that piece does not convince anyone of Mozart's genius, then there is no hope that that appreciation will ever be sparked. At least they had enough sense not to interrupt the Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem played over his burial. The brief scenes from 'The Magic Flute' left me wanting more--the translation into English for those scenes was clever.The production is lavish and a delight to watch. The film deserved its Oscar for costume design--the costumes must have been a major expense. The filming is first rate with sets and architecture that created (at least for me) a feel for what 18th century Vienna must have been like. Some scenes were filmed in an opera house where Mozart himself conducted.",6,8,11,13 December 2013
The Game," Read some of the negative reviews before deciding to see this
","I watched this based on having read many positive reviews. If I had read the negative reviews, I would probably have given it a miss. The main thread common to most all of the poor reviews is how things so quickly spin out of control with absurdity piled on absurdity, finally reaching an ending that ranks with the most ridiculous I have seen.Things start out well enough with Michael Douglas playing the self-important, officious, extravagantly wealthy financier Nicholas Van Orton. Douglas carries this role off well, a talent he has shown in other movies. Things start to go wrong when Van Orton signs on to 'The Game' with a company known as CRS. The game is presented as a mysterious life changing experience with no specifics offered. There is no way a person like Van Orton would have innocently agreed to the detailed interrogation he was subjected to at CRS in order to participate in some game. He would have sent out a fleet of lawyers and investigators to find out every last detail about this company before ever having anything to do with them.Once Van Orton does sign up for the game, things only get more and more unbelievable. The intent is to have the audience guessing what is real and what is part of the game, but, if you are a realist, this hocus-pocus will cease to hold your interest. Michael Douglas and Deborah Kara Unger (who plays Douglas' main antagonist) try to stay serious in what is essentially a frippery. While on screen only briefly, Sean Penn plays Van Orton's brother with the appearance of having participated in this foolishness on a lark.I give the movie credit for its high production values.",2,6,14,22 December 2012
Gran Torino," Message is a bit forced, but entertaining for what it is
","As this movie opens Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) has just lost his wife and wants only to be left alone to sit on his front porch, drink beer, and comment on how the world is going to hell in a hand-basket. But no man is an island and life ultimately intrudes into Walt's world in the form of the Catholic priest of his church and a Hmong family that lives next door. Initially Walt has little use for the priest and nothing but racial slurs and contempt for his neighbors--he calls the young teenage boy who lives there 'Zipperhead,' a derogatory term he probably picked up when he was in the Korean war. The young boy's name is Thao and, in his more considerate moods, Walt calls him 'Toad.' As an initiation rite to get into a gang Thao is tasked with stealing Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino; this theft goes very wrong and Thao almost winds up being shot by Walt in the act of the theft. Thao's family requires him to atone for his attempted crime by working for Walt for several days and it is this event that begins to break through Walt's wall of prejudice as he comes to know the boy and his family.You think you can predict what is going to happen, and that is mostly true, but things don't unfold in quite the way you might anticipate.Eastwood can play 'crusty old man' about as well as you could imagine anyone could. He literally growls on occasion and his expressions of pent up anger can be downright intimidating.Our biases frequently start to break down when we get to know people in a prejudiced group. This message is forcefully hammered home here, but at least the movie is about topics that are real and important. In an era of endless teenage sex comedies, werewolf and zombie movies, and meaningless fantasies, this movie is an admirable departure, and enjoyable in its own right.",8,0,6,29 November 2009
Pawn Sacrifice," Chess champion biopic should appeal to a general audience
","This is a fictionalized biography of the famous chess champion Bobby Fischer. Early scenes from Fischer's childhood are given, but the focus is on the proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union waged on the chessboard between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky in Reykjavik in 1972. With any fictionalized biography I always wonder what is truth and what is fiction, but from doing some research on the web (mainly Wikipedia) it seems that this movie presents things pretty accurately, especially given the tendency for most movies based on fact to change things for dramatic effect. Chess does not lend itself to mass appeal, but this movie does a good job of pacing things to maintain the interest of a general audience.A knowledge of chess is not required to appreciate this movie. All that is necessary to know is that chess in an inordinately complicated game that requires intense concentration. Games at the championship level can last five hours or longer. Not a game for those with a limited attention span. The movie maintains interest, with little emphasis on the details of chess. Liev Schreiber makes a great Spassky and and Toby Maguire is fine as Fischer, but I think it was problematic to cast McGuire as Fischer. McGuire's small stature and general personality is at odds with Fischer's being physically robust and intellectually intimidating. There seems to be an attempt to cast this as a typical sports movie as underdog bucks the odds to defeat the master, but Fischer was a top ranked Grand Master and it was not at all unexpected that he would put up a fight. That being said there *was* a 'solitary U.S. contestant takes on the Soviet chess machine' aspect to the match.I am old enough to remember the Fischer/Spassky match and the political circus surrounding it. It will probably be hard for a younger generation to fully appreciate the significance of the cold war as the backdrop contributing to the tensions of this match, but the movie does a good job of building the tension for the match. For a brief moment in history chess was *the* sport. Hard to fathom from some forty years on. I did learn some things from this movie, such as Spassky's standing and applauding Fischer for his masterful play in winning game six of the championship. And I never knew that Henry Kissinger had called Fischer to encourage him to go to the match.This movie wants to trace Fischer's paranoia to two things: his childhood, growing up with communist parents in the cold war era, and the stress of chess competition. However, after having seen the straight up documentary 'Bobby Fischer Against the World,' I think the representation of Fischer's mental instability in 'Pawn Sacrifice' is overemphasized. In BFAW Fischer is seen as much more disciplined and focused than is hinted at here. For example he maintained a physical fitness regime to equal that of most professional athletes. As serious as Fischer's mental illness apparently became I have to believe that it was more organically based rather than environmentally based. Based on some of his outrageous anti-Semitic and anti-American comments in his later years there is little doubt that his grasp on reality had been seriously compromised, but he had the wherewithal to stage a rematch with Spassky in 1992, which he won.What accounts for the continued interest in Fischer? For example, Gary Kasparov is close to being Fischer's equal at chess, and his life as a writer and political activist after retiring from chess has been remarkable, in a positive sense. But Kasparov has not obtained anywhere near the status in popular culture as Fischer. Why is that? Is it interest in Fischer's fall from grace? Do tragic lives interest us more than successful ones? Is it due to Fischer's mad genius persona? I guess oddballs are more interesting than grinds. As a counterpoint to 'Pawn Sacrifice' I recommend the excellent and captivating movie, 'Searching for Bobby Fischer.' That movie, also based on a true story, shows that a more well-rounded person can excel at chess at a high level.Another movie that details how sports and politics were bound together during the cold war is 'Red Army.' Hockey in that case.",8,1,3,16 February 2016
Garden State," May have limited appeal for anyone over the age of 25
","This movie about Andrew Largemen, a depressed young man in his early 20s who returns to his hometown after nine years for the funeral of his mother, has all the feeling of being written by someone who just graduated from film school. Someone who has seen a lot of movies, but has not experienced much of life.It tries hard to be quirky but winds up being pretentious and irritating. One of the first scenes shows our confused and depressed young hero in bed in a totally white room with no furniture but the bed and a telephone. Maybe this is supposed to symbolize the sterility of his shut down emotional state? Anyway, Andy is so affectless for the first third of the movie that his mood rubbed off on me. I wanted this thing to move on rather than dwell on these self-absorbed slackers. Things did pick up a bit when Sam (Natalie Portman) appeared on the scene, but she was not able to rise above the script. Consider this exchange:Andrew: This hurts so much.Sam: Yeah, I know. But that is life. Nothing else, that's life you know. It's real, sometimes it f**king hurts. Yeah, it's all we have.It's embarrassing.When one of the characters asks if Andy has ever read 'Brave New World,' and tries to remember the author, he first tries 'Aldous something,' then is finally convinced that it's 'Aldous Huxtible.' That's not a conversation anyone is ever likely to have had, except perhaps on a TV sitcom.Then there is the climatic scene where Andy has a heart-to-heart with his dad. Love has brought Andy to life and made a man out of him, except that that scene is totally unconvincing.There are some humorous scenes and the filming is professional, but I think the overriding philosophy was to trot out some attractive young people, introduce a love theme, throw in some odd behavior, play some guitar music in the background, and call it an art film.How Ian Holm ever got involved in this is a mystery.",5,1,3,28 February 2007
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Could have been a good.movie
","(Spoilers) I liked the first third of this movie that focused on the family life of a high-ranking Nazi official living in Berlin in the 1940s. Initially the action is seen through the eyes of Bruno, the eight year old boy in the family. The father has just been promoted to commandant of a death camp and the family is to move there. We follow Bruno's experience in moving from a comfortable life in a big house in Berlin to a walled house in the country where Nazi officials frequently meet. The new house is presented to Bruno as a farm house, the house being far enough from the concentration camp that the camp can be seen only from Bruno's room on the second floor. Being an adventuresome sort Bruno finally makes his way to the camp and, across the electrified barbed wire fence, befriends Shmuel, a boy his age in the camp.The movie goes seriously wrong from the point of the meeting of the boys. The guards at the camp would have been on this Bruno/Shmuel relationship in about one minute and that would have been the end of that. Given that the essential premise is pure artifice, all that follows is the result of a false premise. There are too many wrongheaded events to list and I will give only a couple. The fact that touching the fence would result in serious injury, and likely death, was never addressed directly. In their exchanges across the fence both boys did not seem to regard the fence with proper respect. Even at the age of eight Bruno seemed to be a little dense--did he really not sense the evil that was going on behind the fence? Kids usually pick up on those kind of vibes pretty quickly. Improbably Shmuel shows up at Bruno's home to clean the glassware because he has small hands. Really? Later we see the housekeeper doing this job. The one plot hole that really got me was the digging of the hole under the fence. First of all that could never have happened--do you think the camp guards would not notice that this was going on. It would take a lot of time for an eight year old boy to dig a substantial hole using a flat spade that was not even designed for digging. As presented this was a quick and tidy job. And how was the hole on the opposite side of the fence completed from Bruno's side? Whoever wrote this scene had never dug a hole in the ground.After the setup and before the boys meet, the movie could have gone in a lot of interesting directions. It could have concentrated on Bruno's continuing to discover the truth and his gradual recognition of the evil that was being perpetuated. Or it could have pursued the conflict between the truth and Bruno's indoctrination by Nazi propaganda. An investigation of how the family was going to react over time would have been interesting. The mother was already moving away from the Nazi party line--how was that going to be resolved? The family dynamics over time would have been very interesting to follow without the intrusion of the unbelievable relationship between the two boys.I was encouraged to identify with Bruno by getting to know him and his background well. The effect of not having gotten to know Shmuel or any of the other prisoners hardly at all created an imbalance in the impact of the final tragedy when in fact the enormity of Shmuel's tragic life should have played a more central role. Some flashbacks of Shmuel's life would have helped to more fully identify with him. I found the acting to be uniformly good, particularly the young actors. Resting the movie on Asa Butterflied as Bruno was a risk, but he rose to the occasion. It is frustrating that such a good cast was stuck with such a dog of a screenplay.The original score by James Horner is pleasant enough but it often seemed at odds with the developing tragedy.If you want to see a movie about the impact of war on innocent children, watch 'Ivan's Childhood.' It establishes a totally different mood taking place in the Soviet Union during WWII, concentrating on twelve year old Ivan.",5,0,0,22 March 2016
Into the Wild," Why this is worth seeing
","I read Krakauer's book several years ago and was taken by Chris McCandless' story and by trying to understand him. This movie helped with the latter - images can sharpen the imagination. It needs to be kept in mind that both Krakauer and Penn are presenting us with attempts at biography that are necessarily filtered through their life experiences. By his own admission Krakauer, being an outdoors-man and mountaineer, could see elements of himself in McCandless and I think the film reflects a deep feeling for the young man on Penn's part. The opinions I have about McCandless are thus third-hand and filtered through the lens of my own experience.What makes the McCandless story worthy of attention? It's really not the story, but the man that is the attractor. The story is simple enough - young man becomes alienated by his environment and seeks freedom in adventure. Unless you are quite unusual as a young person you must have had, or have, similar impulses for some adventure. That is an immediate bond most people will feel with him. But most of us don't have the drive or personality to act on these impulses so dramatically. However, McCandless was such an impulsive, romantic, idealist that it appears he could *not* act on these impulses, impulses of long standing for him.It was quite a feat for Krakauer to have tracked down the details of McCandless' journey, and Penn has transformed his book into an excellent film. Little disputed is that McCandless was charismatic; pretty much everyone he met recognized some special spark in him. That is one thing that sets him apart from your average vagabond, he was no crazed nut case. As shown in the movie he was somewhat of an accomplished pianist and you can't fake that. For me Emile Hirsch captured a personal attractiveness in a way that I got only a secondhand feeling for in the book. Also often remarked on was how intelligent McCandless was, and not just his being well educated. He had a vision that people recognized as setting him apart, a vision of his relationship with nature and what it means to be really alive. I thought the nature photography in the film gave us more than a hint as to what McCandless saw in nature that so appealed to him.Most interesting are considerations of the complicated psychology of the man. What would make a charismatic, well educated, physically attractive young man veer off from a future that his society almost ordained he live out? Therein lies the mystery that makes this tale compelling. McCandless' spirit was more in line with Thoreau and Muir than with Kesey or Kerouac. His seeking was more internalized and personal. However, it is interesting that he referred to the day of his coming upon the bus in the wilderness as 'Magic Bus Day.' He must have been familiar with Kesey's quest and was, in his own way, in pursuit of going 'further.' My perception of him is that he was wanting to strip life down to its bare essentials, to get down to the very core of what it means to be alive. It is difficult not to admire that.Some say McCandless did not die of starvation but rather of stupidity. I think such a statement represents a misunderstanding. He died from an overzealous, perhaps naive, sense of adventure and a vision of how life should be lived. He made it for over three months in primitive conditions. How many people could do that? Albeit most people do not want to, but does that mean McCandless' achievement is to be disparaged rather than wondered at? Absent a couple of naive misjudgments, he would have returned with one heck of a story to tell, complete with lessons learned. And is not his youthful naivety the very thing that makes him such a fascinating character? If this had been a story about a person who did things the *right* way - by studying survival books, buying all of the recommended equipment, carrying maps and compass, studying the trails, planning for emergencies, making experimental shorter trips, telling people of his plans and expected locations - it would not have been a story to capture the imagination. McCandless had the temperament of an artist, not that of an engineer.There are some very fine performances here. Besides Hirsch, Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker, as an aging hippie couple still living the life, are notable. Hal Holbrook is a standout as an older man who takes a deep liking to McCandless and is about the last person to be with him before he embarked on his great Alaskan adventure. If Holbrook does not get an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor, then there is no justice. Mysteries remain about Chris. The life force so manifest in him did not seem to express itself sexually, perhaps it was sublimated in some way? And, even though he loved his sister, he did not communicate with her during his journey. He was estranged from his parents, so maybe he felt any communication with his sister would lead to his parents hunting him down? And his charm and ability to be sociable and enjoy people seemed to be at odds with his desire to be alone. McCandless' life is a challenge to all security-seeking, timid, spiritless souls who have never had the courage to ignore social conventions to live life on their own terms. Indeed, never to be fully alive in pursuing a personal passion. When he starved to death in that old bus it was not only a personal tragedy, but also the loss of a person who could have made a significant contribution.So, why is this movie worth seeing? McCandless' trip 'Into the Wild' can serve as a metaphor for us all to take such a trip - there are many ways to go into the wild.",10,3,7,23 December 2007
Invictus," Nelson Mandela, viewed from an oblique angle
","Nelson Mandela is such a towering figure of the 20th century and his life story so dramatic that you would expect any story dealing with him would tend toward an epic biopic. However, in this movie Clint Eastwood gives us insight into the man by focusing on his involvement in the 1995 Rugby World Cup hosted by South Africa, just a year after Mandela was elected President.Mandela's wisdom and foresight is exemplified by his approach to the South African Rugby team, the Springboks. Mandela wanted to capitalize on the world spotlight being on South Africa for the World Cup. Even though rugby had been a sport appreciated mainly by whites, Mandela wanted the team to win and be supported by the entire country, black and white. By supporting the team and refusing to change its name this would be a symbol to the world that indeed things were changing in South Africa. To accomplish his goals Mandela sought the support of the rugby team captain, François Pienaar. Mandela's encouragement and inspiration to Pienaar was no small factor in the Springbok's upset win over New Zealand.Almost as asides we see how adroitly Mandela handled the transition of power, how he was determined not to form a government of retribution for past sins, as feared by many whites, but rather to try to work together with all races. The movie shows how many whites moved from fear to acceptance of Mandela and his policies.Morgan Freeman plays Mandela with quiet dignity, which I think is truly the essence of the man. However, a certain impishness is seen as well. And one senses the sadness of the effects of Mandela's 27 years of imprisonment. That is not dwelled on here--it is enough simply to see the actual prison cell for us to get some sense of the enormity of Mandela's strength of character. From what we see in this film it is not difficult to imagine the farsighted vision Mandela had in creating the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. A politician who puts the welfare of his country over partisanship seems to be a rare quality.Matt Damon is also in good form in his portrayal of François Pienaar. I don't know how accurate his accent is, but it sounded right to me.The Rugby World Cup is not just the backdrop used to reveal character in the protagonists, but it is filmed as a thrilling sporting event in and of itself. Since it follows the script of what actually happened, it has a much more powerful effect than those fictional sports movies where the underdog scores in the last seconds for a stunning victory. I know little about rugby and the main thing I took away from this movie is that it is a brutal sport.I think that focusing on a specific event in Mandela's post-prison life was perhaps as effective in revealing the character of the man as an epic covering the full sweep of his life.",8,1,1,10 October 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Any movie that elicits such a variety of reactions cannot be all bad
","This movie is presented in four acts. In act one we meet Alex and his three henchmen; the four of them burgle, assault, and rape their way through this act, terminated by a killing. In act two Alex is caught and put in prison where, in order to be let free, he volunteers for a Pavlovian anti-violence treatment. In act three Alex is followed after his release from prison; he is as helpless as a declawed cat and ultimately attempts suicide. Act four has Alex the subject of therapy to reverse his prior brainwashing.The reactions to this movie are all over the map, from 'masterpiece' to 'disgusting.' I find that my reactions to it are also all over the map. The violence in the first act is repellent and an assault on the senses, yet at the same time it is presented in such a stylized manner that it is transfixing. I saw this in its original release and have never forgotten the brutality of the scene in the house--ever since then I reflexively tense up whenever my doorbell rings and I don't know who it is. The fear of being transgressed upon in your own home is primal, dating back to the cave men I would think. The encounter between Alex's crew and the rival gang is beautifully choreographed and seems to be a send-up of the barroom brawls in old westerns. It's like Kubrick is saying, 'I'll show you how that can be done.'The scenes where Alex is being subjected to the 'Ludovico treatment' are about as difficult to watch as the scenes of violence. This raises the question of just what practices should be sanctioned in an attempt to control crime. What is done to Alex seems to go over the line, robbing him of the ability to make certain decisions. But then, imprisonment itself robs people of many basic rights, and the death penalty takes away all rights. The question of what rights should be sacrificed in the pursuit of safety is highly relevant in the USA of 2012.The satire in this is not as biting or hilarious as that in 'Dr. Strangelove,' but there is a heavy dose of it. The man whom Alex and his gang violated in his home adopts a liberal stance of being appalled at the inhuman Ludovico treatment, that is until he found out who Alex was, and then he wanted to torture him. The government minister who touted the Ludovico treatment was quick to flip his opinion when the treatment was deemed cruel.It is hard to imagine what this would be without Malcomb McDowell's magnificent performance. He had a good run there in the 1968-1971 time frame with 'If...,' 'O Lucky Man,' and this film. There are other standout performances; I particularly appreciated Michael Bates' Hitlerian fascist prison guard.Some forty years on this movie has not aged a bit. I doubt if this could be made now and, if it were, I doubt it would find a distributor. The fact that the rating was changed from its original 'X' to 'R' is a commentary on how society views content.This is a unique, thought provoking movie filled with stunning images that are not easily forgotten.",9,1,3,15 August 2012
Shine," Problems at its core
","This movie is inspired by the life of David Helfgott. The facts of Helfgott's life that seem to be beyond dispute are that he was a gifted pianist as a child and suffered a mental breakdown as an adolescent that impaired him for life. In spite of his disorder (that landed him in a mental hospital where he was administered Electroconvulsive therapy) he has been able to perform, first in a wine bar and then on the concert stage; he has also made several recordings. Director Hicks admits that this is a partially fictionalized biography and there is dispute as to just how fictionalized it is. Helfgott's sister Margaret has published a book, 'Out of Tune: David Helfgott and the Myth of Shine,' that disputes much of what is in the movie, particularly the portrayal of Peter, the father. And if it is fictionalized, why use the names of real people?Helfgott's story is indeed an interesting one, but pursuing 'the real David Helfgott story' should not be a consideration when evaluating this movie.The biggest problem I had was with the total disconnect between Helfgott's personality in the first half of the movie (before his breakdown) and the second half, many years later. There is little hint of Helfgott's having mental problems before he collapses, after his recital. I cannot believe that such a dramatic personality-changing emotional disorder can be precipitated by a single event, as implied. There had to be warning signs and I felt it was unfair to spring this on us simply for dramatic effect. The extreme transformation from a rather serious, likable, reserved youth to a completely different man/child who loves to hug people and babble incoherently I found unbelievable.The nature of David's mental illness is never explored, and that left me at a loss in trying to understanding the man. Helfgott's troubled relationship with his father is implicated in his breakdown as is his intense preparation for a performance of the Rachmaninov Piano Concerto No. 3. But, lots of people have troubled family dynamics and most every person who embarks on a professional career has moments of extreme stress and they don't come close to David's reaction as seen in this movie. I find the suggestion that strictly external events caused David's breakdown to be disservice to what is known about mental illnesses. Clearly there was a ticking time bomb in David's brain just waiting to be set off.While studying the Rachmaninov at The Royal College of Music in London David's mentor Cecil Parkes makes the comments, 'Performing's a risk, you know--no safety net. Make no mistake, David. It's dangerous. People get hurt.' Also, Helfgott's father has made the comment that the Rachmaninov 3rd Piano Concerto is the hardest piece in the world, which is simply not true. The concerto is indeed a difficult one, but no more so than dozens of other classical pieces and it should be within the abilities of a prodigy in late adolescence. Parkes and Helfgott's father make the decision to perform the Rachmaninov Concerto out to be a life or death venture, that only a few who attempt it survive--this makes for dramatic tension at the expense of the truth.David's father Peter is presented as having a controlling love for his son. Interspersed with some tenderness on Peter's part are episodes of his perpetrating mental and physical abuse. When David has the opportunity to study in America, Peter prohibits it. Later, when David announces he is going to London Peter tries to prevent it and when David says he is going anyway, Peter tells him that if he leaves he will never be allowed back in the house. Peter's behavior makes little sense--he wants his son to succeed in the worst way, but seems bent on preventing that from happening. When Peter tells his son that, 'No one will love you like me,' I would think David's response would be, 'I certainly hope so.'There are a lot of little bothersome things. Like the first scene that has David, as an adult, showing up in the rain late at night at a wine bar that has just closed for the evening. Ignoring discouragement David keeps knocking until the proprietor comes to the door and she quickly adopts the attitude of, 'Oh, come in, we love you.' Hardly a believable reaction to a crazy person appearing at your door speaking in an incomprehensible staccato.When, as a child, David is playing a part of the Rachmaninov Concerto from what he has heard on a recording his father sends him off to bed and, amazingly, then picks up a score for the concerto that just happens to be on the top of the piano. Wouldn't David have looked at that score if he were really interested in learning it?Geoffrey Rush runs around trying his best to make the adult David out to be a mad, but lovable, genius. This is the type of flashy role that wins Oscars, and Rush did. For my money Noah Taylor, as the adolescent David, is the one who shines. John Gielgud, as David's London mentor, is delightful as usual. Armin Mueller-Stahl, as David's father, creates a believable, self-tormented character in his Oscar-nominated performance. Lynn Redgrave is fine as David's wife.I came away feeling that this movie was disguising what could be a truly interesting story.",6,11,17,14 April 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," Perhaps Kubrick's most emotionally accessible film
","As fascinating as they are Kubrick's other films from this are about people and events you are not likely to experience in real life. In this movie Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman) may be living a New York City lifestyle beyond the financial reach of most of us, but it is easy to identify with their emotional lives. They have been married for nine years and the opening scene establishes how comfortable they are with each other, maybe too comfortable. For example, in preparing for an upscale party given by a wealthy friend, Bill is looking in the mirror while Alice is on the toilet. She is dressed in an elegant black gown and when she gets up Bill does not even look at her as he tells her she looks great.At the party both Bill and Alice are the subjects of attempted seductions. The scene between Bill and Alice in their Manhattan apartment after the party is pivotal, and one of the best in the movie. It shows just what a delicate balance relationships can be in. Alice was a little suspicious of Bill's disappearing after she had seen him with two young women at the party and in her interrogation of her husband she subtly twists everything he says to put him on the spot. For her part she confesses to a past obsession with a Naval officer that she had seen only once from a distance. Her confession punctures Bill's confidence in their relationship as he imagines Alice together with the officer. But, beyond the jealousy, Bill's imaginings spark a sexual passion in him. This scene sets up the entire rest of the movie, not only the story line, but the filming. Kubrick's use of color in this movie is striking, lushly lighted foregrounds with contrasting backgrounds. The scene that has Alice softly lighted standing in a doorway with the room behind her a deep blue is typical.In ultimate frustration Bill leaves the apartment to wander the streets of New York. He meets an old friend in a bar and the intrigue begins. Bill winds up at an exclusive ritualistic sexual orgy where everyone wears a medieval mask. Anyone who has seen this movie will remember the orgy scenes--they are mesmerizing, but not pornographic. One thing that is pressed home is how much of sex is driven by what is imagined, both good and bad.As things progress the movie takes on the aspects of part thriller and part comedy. In the end the audience is left asking what is real and what is fake. But at least the relationship between Bill and Alice is resolved.I can't remember when a musical score has played such an important part in a movie. The romantic Shostakovitch Russian Waltz is a perfect background for the lighter scenes, but it is the second movement of Ligeti's Musica Ricercata that adds a particularly haunting quality to the scenes where Bill is wandering in the darkness. I had not realized how the playing of a single note on a piano can build tension.There are scenes that seemed superfluous to me, like the scene where Bill runs into a bunch of rowdies who hector him on the street, accusing him of being gay. This film adds to the distinguished list of accomplishments of a great director.",9,4,6,27 April 2012
Pulp Fiction," A mixed bag
","A bunch of thugs, druggies, and other assorted low-lifes managed to keep my attention for most of this movie due to some sharp dialog, clever time sequencing, great acting, and a high-energy tension filled script. Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) make a great pair of hit men philosophizing and quoting scripture as they go about their brutal business.Having said that, there are significant negatives. The tone is generally that of stylized movie-making fun that is not to be taken seriously. We have, for example, contrived dialog, Mia's (Uma Thurman) making gestures indicating a square that is outlined in white on the screen, references to other movies like the glowing briefcase a la 'Repo Man,' Jack Rabbit Slim's 50s retro bar where Thurman and Travolta do a captivating twist, and so forth. But the violent scenes are disturbingly realistic and Mia's drug overdose is truly vile. I felt whip-lashed by the uneven tone. While most of the dialog is ingenious and engaging, on occasion it falls flat. I am sure that the scene where Butch's (Bruce Willis) girlfriend goes on for five minutes describing what she wants for breakfast is meant to be preciously humorous, but it had me looking at my watch. Then, for such a fast-paced movie, there are inexplicable dead zones like when Butch goes to retrieve his watch from his apartment and for several minutes we watch him park his car and walk through fences and fields before getting there. We know his destination, just jump to the apartment scene please. And would Vincent not hear Butch enter the apartment and would he not take his gun with him to the bathroom? In fact I found the Butch character uninteresting and unnecessary and the movie would have been better if he had been written out. This would have shortened the overly-long run time of 154 minutes to something more reasonable and we would have been spared the over-the-top scene with Zed, Maynard, and The Gimp as well as the homosexual rape. Perhaps the latter was an homage, in questionable taste, to 'Deliverance.' But this movie is not worried about taste. However, without Butch we might have been deprived of the hilarious scene with Christopher Walken, but for all of its significance that scene could have been tossed in almost anywhere.In summary I think this is an undisciplined, sometimes exhilarating, sometimes frustrating, original work of art. It employs a bit of a shotgun approach with more scenes hitting their targets than not.",7,0,1,18 May 2006
The Untouchables," Excellent crime drama
","There is plenty of gun play and action in this movie, but where it really shines in my opinion is in capturing an era. The cars, the clothes, the street scenes, the buildings, the elaborate sets, create the image of a time gone by. The filming is done through the eyes of an artist.The cast is first rate. Eliot Ness is a perfect role for Kevin Costner - a what you see is what you get American hero with a passion for justice. Robert De Niro has played so many tough guys and mobsters that playing Al Capone is second nature to him; I just wish Capone and his mob had been a little better fleshed out here. Sean Connery steals the show in his Academy Award winning role as a beat cop who reluctantly signs up with Ness. And Andy Garcia's performance as another of Ness' team should not be overlooked. The music by Ennio Morricone creates tension and mood. All together, the production values are very high.And there are some great scenes, like Ness' group and the Canadian Mounties pincering a liquor run at a bridge - on horses no less. I'm easy, I thought the re-staging of the famous baby carriage scene from 'Battleship Potemkin' in the context of a shoot-out was a knockout.I wish there had been more context given about the effects of the Eighteenth Amendment - maybe something that would give some perspective on our more recent war on drugs. But this movie is more to be enjoyed than thought about.Costner's last line does add a touch of irony and foreshadows the Twenty-first Amendment.",8,0,1,11 February 2006
A Beautiful Mind," Makes me want to read the book
","Being a mathematician in a previous life, I was looking forward to seeing this movie to see how they could make the life of a mathematician interesting enough to appeal to a wide audience. Well, they did it. By way of high production values, an intelligent screenplay, and excellent performances. I have the feeling that the story was romanticized a fair amount for audience appeal. On the other hand, you get a feel for the pain of mental illness, from the perspective of the ill person as well as those who know him.I am hoping that Nasar's book will give me a more in depth understanding of this man and his illness. In particular, the movie failed completely to give a good idea of just what Nash did to deserve the Nobel Prize.",8,0,2,6 January 2002
The Departed," Quality production, graphic violence, strong language
","The concept of having one Massachusetts State policeman be a mole for the mafia in the police department and another policeman be a mole for the police department in the mafia is an interesting one. The parallel stories of the two policemen are inter-cut with great skill. Keeping up with the complex interplay between the Irish Mafia, the Special Investigations Unit of the Massachusetts State Police, the FBI, the Italian Mafia, and the regular Massachusetts State Police kept me on my toes. Scorcese extracts some excellent performances from Damon and DiCaprio. Restraining Nicholson seems to be the challenge with him at this stage in his career and, barring a couple of excesses, he is in good form. And the wonderful Ray Winstone is perfect for his part - he is so good that you don't know he is acting, until you realize he is a native Brit and is effecting a quite believable American accent.In the lives of people like Mark Foley, Larry Craig, and Ted Haggard we have seen the ultimate effects of long-term pretense at being something you are not. The analysis of pretense behavior for Damon and DiCaprio is more subtle. They both have qualms about their double lives, but they have been trapped by their decisions, and all does not end well. The examination of character traits that lead to tragedy almost makes this movie have Shakespearean dimensions. And, in Shakespearean fashion, it ends with a heap of dead bodies.If you are put off by strong language and explicit violence, don't go near this. Some of the violence seemed gratuitous to me and by the end I had seen quite enough of people getting shot in the head. But I guess Scorsese wanted us to see the brutal world these people were living in.I felt that Damon and DiCaprio having the same love interest was an unnecessary plot complication and I did not sense any chemistry in either of the relationships. Some of the filming techniques puzzled me. For example, when Nicholson first comes on screen he remains in shadows until he finally appears in a full color close up. I did not get the significance of that unless it was a takeoff on Orson Welles' entry in 'The Third Man.'But, it's hard to find much fault with this film.",8,0,1,20 September 2007
Crazy Heart," Surprised me
","I had hesitated to watch this for fear it would basically be a remake of 'Tender Mercies,' a great movie that I did not want to spoil the memory of. But this movie shows that there is still room for at least one more entry in the 'country singer hits bottom' genre. As well recognized, Jeff Bridges is wonderful as Bad Blake, an alcoholic country singer who is a bit of a poet, a free spirit, and a wounded soul. Bad had a successful past but his drinking is getting the best of him and he is winding up playing gigs in small bars with pick-up bands.I found the relationship between him and the aspiring journalist Jean developed naturally. Blake was kind enough to grant Jean an interview and when they first met they had some chemistry. Blake is viewing her as just another interviewer until she mentions she knows about Lefty Frizzell, something that Blake did not expect of her. He perked up after that. Of course the fact that Jean is a beautiful woman caught his interest right off. In the first interview Blake asks Jean more questions than she asks him. When they get a little further along we see that Bad has a real fondness not only for Jean but for her young son as well.A real plus is that we get to see Blake perform at some length. This movie will appeal a lot more to you if you enjoy the music as much as I did.As Blake rides from location to location in the southwest we get to see some good scenery. This movie is exceedingly well edited and filmed; nothing flashy, just well done.I had not read much about this movie beyond its being about a country singer past his prime. So I was surprised when Robert Duvall showed up as an old friend of Bad's. And more surprised when Colin Farrell showed up as Tommy, one of Bad's partners from the old days. While Bad has headed down, Tommy has headed up. Bad and Tommy have a great duet scene when they are on the same bill one night. This movie touches on meaningful themes of loyalty, friendship, love, and sex. Can't ask for much more than that.",9,1,1,10 February 2011
There Will Be Blood," Greed is not good
","This is the story of Daniel Plainview, an oilman living at the beginning of the 20th century. We are asked to invest a lot of time in getting to know this rather unlikeable man and I am not sure it is a good investment. As Daniel slips deeper and deeper into the clutches of his greed I found myself caring less about him and about the movie. Daniel is not complex enough to hold your attention for over two and a half hours, he is defined by his greed and little else. The only appealing qualities he ever displays are some affection for his adopted son and a man who presents himself as a long-lost brother. He abandons the boy when he can no longer use him for his own interests and he kills the would-be brother when he discovers he is a pretender. Daniel ultimately reaps the consequences of his monomania, doomed to wander alone in his mansion with no friends and no real interests.The overarching theme of how secular capitalists use religion when it suits them and how religious people use capitalists when it suits them is topical and casts a pall of cynicism over the proceedings. If such a theme appeals to you, then you will be delighted that the resolution between the capitalist and the minister is mutual destruction. On a less abstract level, we are left with stereotypes for greedy oilmen and fake evangelical ministers.Undoubdedly Day-Lewis gives a strong performance. For me his performance is undermined by that of Paul Dano as the faith-healing Eli Sunday. I suppose Eli was modeled after Billy Sunday, the Billy Graham of the time, but Dano is remarkably unconvincing in this role. No matter what your religious persuasion the successful faith-healers and revivalists can really get you going-- they are masters of mob psychology. Dano has neither the voice nor the demeanor to pull this off, his acting skills in this department pale in comparison to the people in real life. He is embarrassingly weak in the final scene.The period details of early 20th century life seem authentic and provide the film with much of its interest. In particular, capturing the details of working on an oil drilling rig at the beginning of the oil industry in the United States is done most impressively. There are some incredible scenes like the one showing how explosive gas fires were extinguished. Clearly a lot of effort and research went into the filming.Music plays a big part. The original score by Jonny Greenwood works well, creating subtle premonitory feelings. This is particularly effective in the beginning fifteen minutes where Daniel's first mining experiences are set forth, and not a word is spoken. Indeed after the first fifteen minutes I was anticipating something very special. The use of Arvo Pärt's 'Fratres' establishes an appropriate mood and melds seamlessly with Greenwood's score, but the use of the Brahms violin concerto is so out of place as to seem positively bizarre.This started strong and finished weak.",7,2,4,23 October 2008
Whiplash," Familiar storyline, elevated by high production values and excellent performances
","J.K. Simmons plays Fletcher, a task master from hell in charge of a jazz band at an exclusive school. As told, students of Fletcher's frequently go on to successful careers, but Fletcher admits that he never mentored a Charlie Parker.Andrew, an ambitious young drummer comes to Fletcher's band with the idea of becoming the best drummer of all time, setting up a classic conflict of arrogant young student versus an instructor who borders on the sadistic. Fletcher recognizes Andrew's talent, but his philosophy is that people have to be pushed hard (an understatement) if they are going to reach the maximum height that their talent will take them. His method of pushing comes by way of trying to intimidate by the force of his menacing personality and telling students they are never quite up to his standards. Fletcher's idea is that unless a student can stand up to his regimen, then they do not have the drive to excel at the highest levels. In order to put up with Fletcher Andrew must have figured that getting his imprimatur would rate highly for future success. There was not much back-story given for either Fletcher or Andrew and I was left having to fill in a lot of that. For example, why did Fletcher command such respect that Andrew would put up with him? Fletcher could have been a strong father figure for Andrew, since Andrew indicated that his father was somewhat of a failed writer, a writer who maybe had not pushed himself.I appreciate that Fletcher's abusive style was exaggerated for dramatic effect (at one point he actually slaps Andrew on the face several times), but his military style of instruction is not rare. Only once in my life did an instructor ever get from me something beyond which I never thought I was capable. There was honest criticism, but mainly this instructor was so inspiring that I wanted to please him; I think his approach is to be preferred to that of Fletcher, but almost every day we see sports coaches who have adopted the Fletcher style.I have no great fondness for jazz and tend to view drum solos mainly as noise, but that did not keep me from enjoying this movie which touches on some broad themes. The arc of the story is familiar and it is mainly the high production values and excellent performances that carry the day.I wish there had been *some* indication that the people in Fletcher's band were there because they enjoyed making music, rather than primarily being driven there by an ambition to compete.I came away from this with mixed emotions. It is over the top, but I can't dismiss it.",8,2,5,28 April 2015
The Last King of Scotland," Eases you into the horror
","I put off seeing this film since I did not see how the horrors of the Amin regime in Uganda could make for anything but a depressing movie. But inserting the fictional Dr. Garrigan, a young naive doctor who wants to escape a domineering father and experience life, makes for an excellent plot device. Garrigan's decision to go to Uganda to help out at a local clinic provides an agreeable prologue where we get to see some of the Ugandan countryside and native culture, filmed in luscious color. Also, adding the doctor enlarges the moral dimensions as we follow his ethical challenges.Early on we see Amin as being somewhat likable and charismatic. Falling under the spell of his power and prosperous lifestyle is very understandable, so when Dr. Garrigan (who through a couple of random events has helped Amin) is offered being Amin's personal physician, we see the appeal. The plot is cleverly structured - since we can identify with Garrigan we share his alarm, and ultimate desperation, as the scales fall from his eyes and he gradually becomes aware of just what Amin is up to.Even though we are provided enough information to pass final judgment on Amin, he remains somewhat of an enigma. When he talks about setting up a fund for England and offering to send food for the staving English does he actually believe in that? When a quirky somewhat childlike character like Amin is given absolute power it is likely that ill consequences will result. It is only natural to want to eliminate one's detractors and, when Amin uses his dictatorial power to do so, it is not clear that it reflects a strain of evil at his core, but rather he does it because he can.Several of the scenes in this movie are reenactments of actual scenes in the documentary 'Général Idi Amin Dada: Autoportrait.' That outstanding documentary is a great complement to this movie.Then there is Forest Whitaker who gives the performance of a lifetime. He clearly studied the documentary mentioned above, since he perfectly captures the speech patterns and body movements of the real Idi Amin. James McAvoy is good, but believing that Amin would come to regard such an immature and inexperienced young man as his chief adviser was a bit of a stretch for me.",9,0,1,28 July 2008
August Rush," Takes unbelievability to new heights
","(*Spoilers*) Famous concert cellist Lyla has a one night stand with rocker Louis that produces a son Evan (aka August) who is surreptitiously sent to an orphanage by Lyla's controlling father because he believes the child may harm Lyla's career. After these opening scenes we rejoin the story when August is about twelve. Then the separate paths of the three protagonists are traced until their inevitable reunion. It would take more than a thousand words to detail all the preposterous story lines. Let's just consider a few. August is a musical genius who would easily put Mozart to shame: he becomes a skilled guitarist within the first hour of exposure to a guitar; he starts composing and notating a symphony immediately after being shown the basic scales; he can play an organ, complete with pedals and stops, on a first try; he is skilled enough to conduct the New York Philharmonic; in the final scene we come to understand he has a certain level of extrasensory perception. There are some equally absurd things that could be said about Lyla's story.I suppose this would all be well and good if this were clearly presented as fantasy, but as far as I could tell we are expected to ascribe some element of belief to the happenings. There is a serious problem with this--such stories advance the 'you can be anything you want to be' philosophy without any discussion of how that can frustrate kids when they realize that it's simply not true. Young people who watch this movie could be led to believe that accomplishments occur without the long hard work required, no matter how talented they are.Freddy Highmar (as August) has a winning screen presence and an infectious smile, but I am not sure his acting ability is beyond that of the charming kid next door.The most infuriating thing is that there is the kernel of a good movie here. The scenes illustrating August's sensitivity to all manner of sounds is well done. I'm sure that this is true of most musicians and I would liked to have seen that explored in more detail. Some of the guitar work is excellent and I think there must have been someone behind the scenes with a developed musical sense, it's too bad that that person (or persons) was not given more free reign.This is an unfortunate misfire.",3,20,31,22 September 2008
The Mission," Falls short
","In 1750 the Treaty of Madrid ceded parts of the Spanish territories in Brazil to Portugal. In those territories were several independent Catholic Jesuit missions that had been established to bring Christianity to the local Guarani tribes. One such mission, the San Carlos, is presented in this film as being hugely successful, where the priest, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), has brought the Indians out of the jungle to create a near paradisaical community. The tribe lives in harmony and views its priest as the bringer of good, and adores him--smiles and warm feelings all round. This is the first problem I had with the film. Any clash of cultures is bound to create frictions; indeed at the beginning of this movie the very Indians that Father Gabriel has so won over had strapped their previous priest to a cross and sent him to his death by setting him afloat above falls some 200 feet high. It was not clear to me what special talents Father Gabriel had that would not only reverse the existing animosities but endear him to the tribe to the extent that he was venerated.Officially the Spanish disallowed slavery whereas the Portugese used slave labor to help build their empire (in actual fact both countries were complicit in the practice). Anyway, the transfer of the mission territories to the Portugese 'freed' the Indians to become slaves. But the Catholic Church had a say in what should become of the missions and Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) was sent to resolve the issue. In some ways Altamirano was a tragic figure: while he was encouraged by the Church to close the missions in order to stay in the good graces of Spain and Portugal (as well as to suppress the Jesuit order that the Church felt was becoming too powerful and independent), his sympathies lay with the missions and their priests. After having made his decision, one of Altamirano's aids remarked, 'We must work in the world, your eminence. The world is thus,' to which Altamirano responded, 'No, thus have we made the world... thus have I made it.' The most interesting parts of the movie involve the political manoeuvrings between Spain, Portugal, and the Catholic Church--in particular I found it interesting to see how deeply enmeshed in politics the Church was at the time.Jeremy Irons is well cast as Father Gabriel, ably encompassing a range of gentleness, sternness, and passionate devotion. Robert De Niro turns in a surprisingly weak performance; a scene that has him transform from tears to joy is embarrassing to watch. Apparently De Niro doesn't do weeping or fake joy well. Anyone hoping that the scenes between Irons and De Niro would be exceptional will be disappointed. The real standout in the acting department is Ray McAnally as Cardinal Altamirano--he has some of the best dialog and is able to communicate the anguish the Cardinal experiences in making his difficult decision. Many things just don't make sense. The San Carlos Mission is located above the falls and an initial scene that has Father Gabriel traveling to the mission shows him to be an expert rock climber--he is seen scaling a vertical rock wall and we are forced to watch the first of the obligatory, 'I'm slipping and I may fall to my death' scenes. Shortly after Father Gabriel's trip to the mission De Niro, who is a slave trader at the beginning of the film, is seen riding into the town below the falls on horseback (with much fanfare) with about a dozen Indians in tow, both on foot and on horseback. Since De Niro was seen poaching Indians above the falls, I assumed that the Indians he had captured came from above the falls, but are all people in the area world-class rock climbers? Can horses scale vertical cliffs? Leaving that aside, how did De Niro, acting alone, capture over a dozen Indians? The Portugese soldiers are seen scaling the vertical cliffs, but others seem to pop up at the mission when it is convenient to have them there--even the good Cardinal winds up at San Carlos, and for sure he was no expert rock climber. I never had a good idea of the local topography. Confusion is a common reaction; it was never clear to me who some of the characters were, and the final battle scenes are totally chaotic.De Niro does penance for killing his brother in a duel by carrying a bagful of heavy armor up to the San Carlos Mission. That whole sequence is so tedious and prolonged that I began to think I was being asked to share in his misery. I kept saying to myself, 'I've paid my penance, let's move on.'This film is advertised as a true story but it would more accurately be described as being loosely based on historical facts.As universally agreed, the film has scenes of stunning natural beauty, being filmed in part at the Iguazu Falls and in the jungles of Columbia. While these beautifully filmed scenes alone make the movie worth seeing, a drama should be more than a travelogue. Ennio Morricone's score is memorable, but I found it intrusive on occasion.'The Mission' had ample material for the making of a great movie, but its lack of narrative focus and inability to involve you emotionally causes it to fall short. For a more powerful movie that treats the same theme of a priest entering virgin territory to convert native Indians to Christianity, see the wonderful 'Black Robe.' For a transfixing experience concerning early Conquistador forays into South America (accomapnied by a priest) see 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God.'",6,2,7,20 June 2009
The Good Shepherd," 'The Godfather' meets 'The Conversation'
","This is an ambitious film covering over thirty years in the life of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) from his student days at Yale until his heading counterintelligence at the CIA. The story begins in 1961 with Wilson's following reports on the CIA-supported Bay of Pigs disaster and its immediate outcome. The tale is told by interweaving flashbacks of Wilson's life and career with the unfolding and aftermath of the events in Cuba, as received by the CIA.A puzzle that propels the film is solving the mystery of a leak from a high-level source about the location of the land invasion of Cuba that was crucial in contributing to the Bay of Pigs failure. A key element in determining the source of that leak is a grainy black and white film that mysteriously turns up under Wilson's door. The high-tech tools and deductive reasoning that are brought to bear in analyzing this piece of film fascinate and remind one very much of the analysis of the audio tape that so kept one's attention in 'The Conversation.'A theme that runs throughout is the effect that Wilson's job as a high-level intelligence agent has on him and his family. He obsessively observes the secrecy requirements of his job; he does not share anything with his family. His several year stint with the OSS in Germany after the war, away from his family, causes a rift in his marriage that is never really healed. When he comes back from Germany his wife (Angelina Jolie) suggests they sleep in separate rooms until they can get to know each other again. But physical separation is not the only difficulty in the marriage. To say that Wilson is rather restrained and emotionally remote is an understatement. One questions whether such personalities as Wilson's are attracted to top secret intelligence work or rather are the result of such work. In Wilson's case there is a hint that it is the latter. Anyway, Wilson comes to suffer the same fate of becoming isolated and friendless as Michael Corleone in 'The Godfather,' for the same reasons of having to keep his day job a secret and being unable to trust anyone. Wilson is the ultimate patriot and he pays a heavy price for it.Given the withdrawn nature of Wilson's personality Matt Damon is not called upon for bravura here, but he does skillfully create a distinctive persona. Machael Gambon is particularly good in his brief appearances.Who knows what the truth is, but this film creates an aura of believability. I just hope there is not much truth to the Skull and Bones sequences at Yale - one does not like to think that in their early maturity our best and brightest future leaders behave like pre-adolescent boys.Those who like intricate, intelligent and deliberately paced spy thrillers will not be disappointed with this.",8,1,2,26 December 2007
Platoon," Intense, difficult
","Most will find this ultra realistic Vietnam war story a difficult film to watch, especially those who lived through that era. I had put off seeing this all these years since I was afraid of the memories it would bring back, and I was never even in the service. One of the few statements that Dick Cheney has made that I identify with is, 'I had other priorities in the '60s than military service.' Truth be told staying out of Vietnam was a priority of mine, as well as most of my friends - the specter of the draft was always there. Student deferments were the method of choice for accomplishing avoidance for a lot of kids. But then in 1969 came the draft lottery - every day of the year was assigned a number and the lower your number the more exposed you were to being drafted. The lottery was televised and I remember sitting in a large room with about sixty guys and hearing the groans as the low numbers were drawn out of the hopper. This was truly a surreal experience, a mild version of Russian roulette. Many of those with low numbers opted for the method of last resort - flight to Canada. I offer this memory as but one that this film triggered. Almost everyone who lived through the Vietnam war era was scarred by it - few got off scott-free, including of course the countries involved (estimated U.S. deaths 58,000, with 300,000 wounded; estimated Vietnam deaths in excess of one million). The wounds are still healing.The most acute memories this movie brought back were recollections of the clips on the nightly news which indeed had the same feel as this movie. Oliver Stone's having served in Vietnam lends credence to this harrowing tale; you have to assume that it is to no small extent autobiographical.The satire of 'Tropic Thunder' notwithstanding, no matter the the backstage antics, judgment should be rendered on the quality of the final product. And 'Platoon' ranks high on that scale. The performances are uniformly good, presenting us with an ensemble of believable characters.The real quality of the film lies in its focus on how the soldiers dealt with the constant backdrop of anxiety, chaos, and fear. This is captured so well that those emotions are transmitted to the viewer, albeit at what is probably a one per cent level of what the actual soldiers experienced, but enough to cause troubled sleep. There are no battle charts or high level officers discussing strategy here, just what the men in this platoon were facing on a daily basis. One of the values of the film is that it dispels much of the mystery as to how some of the horrendous things that were reported at the time (like civilians being killed, villages burned, officers fragged) could happen. And you see why using any drugs to get you through the day made perfect sense. It makes you a lot more hesitant to pass judgment on the actions of soldiers while sitting in the comfort of your home.I think this is the least political of Stone's films. There seems to be a desire just to 'tell it like it was.' The political back-story never enters into the picture. There were not many people who served in Vietnam with the intelligence and movie-making skills of Stone and it is good that he has given us this film as one portal to understanding what happened on the ground in Vietnam.I have always been curious as to whether I would have lasted ten minutes or five on the ground in Vietnam. Seeing this movie indicates to me that the latter is probably the case.",9,0,1,22 August 2008
Mr. Holland's Opus," Okay, so it's predictable and sentimental
","Maybe I just needed a break from watching too many Bergman movies, but I liked this sentimental and predictable movie covering thirty years in the life of a high school music teacher. High school being in my distant past, this movie brought back a lot of wistful memories. Even something as simple as remembering how the vacant hallways turn to chaotic madness at the sound of a bell was cause for nostalgia. The teacher in question, Glenn Holland, gets into the profession in order to have a day job while he works on composing. But the job eats up most of his time and, when he and his wife have a child, his early dreams have little chance of ever being realized. Many people back into life-long jobs and, as Mr. Holland, they grow into their professions and find them rewarding.Most everybody has memories of good teachers, and Glenn Holland will probably bring them to mind. That in itself makes this movie worth seeing. We don't have all that many movies about teachers, so there is room for one more. In fact we have very few movies that concentrate on any profession in a serious way. In many movies it is hard to figure out just how people are making their livings.Richard Dreyfus' performance is what raises this movie above the average. Tracing a life over a period of thirty years is always a challenge and that challenge was met here, both in terms of capturing the cultural changes from 1964 to 1995 and in terms of Dreyfus' physical appearance and emotional outlook.The story is pretty predictable, but, hey, think of all of those sports movies where the home team wins in the final scene. This movie has more substance than most of those movies that seem to be churned out on a weekly basis.I have to say that the talent in this high school far exceeds anything that I recall in my high school. Holland has his orchestra sounding like a first-rate community orchestra. And the Gershwin review was far from amateurish - enjoyable in its own right. In my high school of over 3,000 students we had nobody to compare with the voice and poise of Jean Kelly.There are some good scenes, like the one where Dreyfus urges Kelly to take the risk and follow her dreams and go to New York to pursue a singing career. That scene ends with Dreyfus staring into space with a melancholy gaze - is he regretting that he did not take the risk he is encouraging Kelly to take, or is he realizing that he never had a talent comparable to hers? I thought that Holland's having to struggle to teach the black kid how to find the beat was a good touch.If you can put your critical thinking on hold just a bit, you will enjoy this.",8,2,4,22 February 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Excellent comedy-drama
","I wish people could comment on a Woody Allen film based on its merits rather than its being a Woody Allen film. It seems that the main topic of discussion about a Woody Allen film is about the director. Has Woody lost it? Is this film among his best, or is it just average? Is this typical Woody Allen? Why isn't he as funny as he used to be? Don't you hate Woody Allen films? Doesn't he always just cover the same ground? It seems that people have become obsessed with reacting to the director rather than to his films.I wager that if Allen had made this film under a pseudonym, it would have been tagged as a refreshing work of a talented director. And that is what it is. The photography is lush; every scene is beautifully lighted and shows great care in its presentation. Consider the scene in the fruit and vegetable market where the merchandise is carefully arranged and the colors are a feast for the eyes, or the verdant backdrop for the picnic with the flowers gently swaying in the wind. The sights of Barcelona serve as a mini travelogue and enrich the film. If nothing else, Allen has become very accomplished in his presentation and he has to be ranked as a skillful director.The story is about two attractive young women spending the summer months in Barcelona where they become entangled in a love triangle with Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). When Jaun Antonio's ex-wife enters the picture, she squares the triangle. The actors are all on target with Rebecca Hall being a standout as Vicky. Barem plays Juan Antonio with such charm that he refutes any early inclinations you might have that he is a snake. He is a smooth operator, but he is never less than honest. The musical score featuring guitar works by Albeniz, de Lucia, and Serrano (among others) complements the warmth of the photography.I was puzzled by the all-knowing narrator who makes occasional observations throughout the film. I have nothing against such in general, but here most of the narrator's comments are superfluous and simply describe what can be otherwise deduced.There is one scene that epitomizes the movie for me. It has Jaun Antonio talking to Vicky saying, 'Love requires a perfect balance. It's like the human body. It may turn out that you have all the vitamins and minerals, but if there is a minor, single, tiny ingredient missing, like ... salt, for example, one dies.' In response Vicky deadpans, 'Salt?' A truth is punctuated with a humorous response.",9,2,6,25 May 2009
Sweet and Lowdown," An episodic bonbon
","This is a slight but delightful work. The story is a (fictional) biography of one Emmet Ray, a cad with a passion for watching trains and shooting rats in junk yards and who just happens to be a virtuosic guitarist. Emmet does not lack for talent and ego, but his drinking, philandering, and small-time philanthropizing keep him from capitalizing on his genius. He is obsessed with Django Reinhardt as being perhaps the only guitarist who might be better - Ray has fainted both times he was in the presence of Reinhardt. The story is told as if it were a documentary of a real person with talking heads interspersed with dramatizations. It could be taken as a satire on that style of presentation since the critics being interviewed come across with just a touch of fake sincerity.The enjoyment comes from the atmospheric and detailed re-creation of the 1930s. The nightclub scenes are a particular highlight. In fact a whole movie of just those kinds of scenes with 1930s jazz bands and singers might have been an improvement to this movie, since that is where this movie really shines.The filming uses over-saturated colors to good effect, creating a cozy and warm feeling. There is humor, but it is gentle, particularly for Woody Allen.As usual Allen has assembled a cast of attractive women. Samantha Morton, who plays a mute who turns out to be Ray's true love interest (a fact he realizes too late) is a joy to watch. Her performance recalls the sweet silent movie stars. Sean Penn does well with his playing Ray as somewhat of a train wreck of a man who frustrates all those he encounters, but who never-the-less has endearing qualities. He is transported into another dimension when he plays his guitar and he takes his audiences with him.",7,1,1,6 January 2006
The Deer Hunter," Loses a lot on a second viewing
","(Spoilers) I saw this movie in its original release and, upon a recent viewing, I could remember the basic idea of the story that follows three steel workers from their roots in a small Pennsylvania town, to a tour of duty in Vietanm, then back home. What I remembered clearly were the Russian roulette scenes. These are big gut grabbers, but when I started to think about them in more detail, I began to question why they were in there beyond their being attention getters. The only reason I can see is their being a metaphor for the random violence and killing of war--but we already knew that. The scenes do not make a lot of sense. The games were surrounded by much chaos and heavy betting. As presented it appeared that a given game was played until one of the players lost his life and, if the betting was on who 'won,' then it would be a fifty-fifty bet and hardly a cause for such hooting and hollering. If the betting was on how long a game would last, then the distribution of wins and losses would be complicated and require the skill of a Vegas croupier to resolve. In any case the betters are seen throwing wads of money down into a pile on a table and I don't see how the money could ever have been properly split up among the winners. Given how much money Nick sent back to Steven the winner was apparently amply rewarded, but how he was paid off was not clear. By the time Michael catches up with him Nick's mind is so shot he does not even recognize his old friend, so how is it that Nick had the wherewithal to send money to Steven? If so, how did he arrange for that? Where were the betters getting all that money? The odds of Nick's winning as many times as implied would be astronomical. The bottom line for me was to find the Russian roulette scenes quite unbelievable and that undercut my appreciation of the whole movie, since those scenes are pivotal. And is it to be believed that Michael could find Nick in the total chaos of the fall of Saigon?The hunting scenes struck me as odd. Nowhere near Pennsylvania are there mountains like the ones in those scenes. Perhaps those scenes were a warning to the audience that a good deal of the movie is to be symbolic rather than realistic, but I found the scenes precursors to a disjointed sequencing that persisted throughout the remainder of the film. Some of the symbolism is a bit too obvious. For example, during Steven's wedding the bride and groom are asked to drink chalices of wine and if they can do so without spilling any, they will have good luck. Then we see some small droplets of wine spilled on the bride's gown, symbolizing the bloodshed to come.One thing that is well executed is the discrepancy between the youthful (perhaps played by actors not quite youthful enough) naivety of the three protagonists pre-war and the difficult post-war fallout. The bonding of the circle of the male friends pre-war had all of the maturity of early teens. By the end of the movie Nick was dead, Steven had lost his legs and was suffering mental and physical readjustments, and Michael, the strongest, was having his own problems reentering society. In fact the often puzzling reactions Michael had to returning home were for me the most moving scenes in the movie.A good part of the first act of the movie is an exceptionally beautiful filming of Steven's wedding in a Russian orthodox church. That segment is almost worth the price of admission by itself.I can't quarrel with the acting--the fine cast turns in quality performances. The editing is sometimes quite effective. After the wedding sequences we are abruptly put into the middle of the fighting in Vietnam; this emphasizes how the three friends must have viewed the transition. For those who lived through the Vietnam era, this movie will most likely bring back a lot of painful memories.I find that most good movies improve on second viewing. This was an exception for me. I could not get beyond the improbabilities and emotional manipulations the second time around.",7,0,1,24 May 2010
Amélie," Take off those orange colored glasses please
","This movie tries so hard to be cute and clever that its concentrated sweetness gave me a high for about five minutes and then I crashed for the rest of it. Amalie (Audrey Tautou) has the demeanor of a spoiled little girl who grew up thinking she was ever so cute. She seems to be saying, 'Look at me, can you resist me?' And then she gives off a self-satisfied smile with the hint, 'You thought I was cute before, aren't you blown away by my smile?' Ugh.But the thing that really bugs me about this movie is Amelie's conceit. She presumes to know what will make others happy and meddles in their lives. Among the things this adorable girl does is break and enter an apartment to do mean things to its owner's possessions, send false letters, short out people's TV's at peak moments, lie to people about who loves them, make anonymous phone calls without having the integrity to speak with the callee, and steal one of her father's prize possessions.I know that we are supposed to accept the fantasy nature of this film where photos talk, statues wink, and people always answer public phones, but my patience for this kind of thing wore thin very fast. We are told, shown actually, that Amelie's mother was killed by a suicidal person jumping off of Notre Dame and landing on her. How are are we supposed to react to that? Is it supposed to be funny? Wasn't to me.Then there is the agonizing game that Amelie plays with the guy she falls for. She gives him hints and, given the opportunity to make contact, shies away. You just want to shake her and tell her to just talk to the guy for heaven's sake. Finally at the end they meet and the first thing they do without saying a word is kiss and have sex. What kind of message is that? The whole movie is filmed through some kind of orange filter that I suppose is meant to cast some sort of romantic candle-lit effect over the proceedings, but for me it was just one more barrier that prevented me from getting close to this movie.",2,14,29,27 April 2006
Moonrise Kingdom," Not everyone loves this, or even likes it
","When I read the synopsis, 'tells the story of two twelve-year-olds who fall in love, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness', I was thinking that this may not be the type of movie I would enjoy. But, after reading many rave reviews and noting the quality of the cast, I thought I should give it a shot. Unfortunately my initial thinking was correct.The first scene that has a tall Edward Norton emerging from a smallish tent to review his scout troops in a flippant manner was a warning that this was going to be a long haul for me. The dominate elements of whimsy and fantasy to follow the initial scene I found to be forced and nonsensical. For example, why did Frances McDormand have to yell at her kids through a bullhorn when she could just as well have shouted? The two kids head off into the forest with a small backpack and then we see that they have set up a large tent, packed a gross of cat food tins, have a bow and arrow, and so forth. One of the most ridiculous scenes has the young boy being struck by lightening with only his fiery shoes left, but then he emerges with only charcoal having been applied to his face. There is a tree house perched atop a slender 40 foot tree. And so on. The time period is 1965 and some attention is given to period details, but that effort seems rather pointless given the overall unbelievability of the story. It provoked a bit of nostalgia in me to hear parts of Leonard Bernstein's narration of Benjamin Britten's 'The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra,' played in the background in some scenes.The great cast is pretty much wasted in undemanding roles. They seemed to be simply going through their paces. Bruce Willis has been singled out for his performance, but I think the only thing remarkable about it is that he is playing against type. The young girl's principal contribution is being a pretty young girl. The main character, the young boy, I found irritating and could see why his scout mates did not like him.This is the first Wes Anderson movie I have seen and if this is representative of his style, I know to avoid his other movies.This is billed partly as a drama. If you are a person who hopes that a drama will have some shred of believability, then this movie is most likely not for you.",2,9,20,15 July 2012
The Matrix," Much glitz, little content. [spoilers]
","You cannot help but be impressed with the tremendous amount of work that went into the making of this movie, but the result is much flash and dazzle with very little content.  I would have hoped for more.The plot is so confused and confusing that I gave up trying to make any sense out of it after about 20 minutes.  The plot line ultimately reverts to a classic good-guys vs. bad-guys shoot-em-up.  The movie is kind of a 'Karate Kid' on steroids, except that the characters in 'The Karate Kid' are much more involving.The subtheme concerning the nature of reality adds no new insight in trying to answer this eternal question.  Any child who stops to think about the artificial reality created strictly by the mind in the dream state has gotten as far as this movie makes you go.  'The Forbidden Planet' examines this question in a much more interesting and thoughtful way.The subtheme concerning finding 'The Chosen One' seemed to be thrown in as an attempt at trying to give the hopelessly misguided script some heft.  Some 'meaning.'  If you want to see a beautiful and sensitive treatment of this, see Scorsesse's 'Kundun.'Except for Fishburn, the acting was uniformly wooden. Keanu Reeves seems to have the emotional range of a potato.  I wound up not caring for any of the people in this movie - whether they lived or died made no difference to me. I found the love interest unbelievable.The intro to the DVD made me think that I was going to like the music at least.  But I cannot even remember this movie as having a soundtrack, it was so unmemorable.The agents for the Matrix were stereotypical, in a movie that seemed to want to break stereotypical images - like the supreme Mother being an aging and unattractive lower middle class woman.  If you are really thinking about how to be innovative in portraying evil, think of the devil in 'The Last Temptation of Christ.'I think about this movie in comparison to '2001' in trying to figure why I liked '2001,' but disliked this movie so much. Both movies have memorable images, but '2001' creates a sense of beauty and mystery, whereas 'The Matrix' creates a sense of anxiety and dread.Ultimately I found 'The Matrix' to be drab, depressing and cold. I found its glorification of violence repellent.",3,3,7,6 November 2001
Heat," Strong on testosterone, weak on script
","The only thing that would separate this from being just another cops and robbers movie is the star power of Pacino and De Niro. But I just kept thinking of what a good movie these two could have been in rather than this routine outing that did not push them beyond the stereotypes that they themselves have helped create. The 'just one more score' theme is getting a little threadbare too. We have seen Pacino and De Niro in these kinds of roles so often that I could not separate the actors from the characters they were playing. So many plot elements just do not hold up. The relationship between De Niro and the lovely Amy Brenneman is unbelievable. A young, gentle bookstore clerk is going to get mixed up with tough guy De Niro and not be just a little interested in what he does for a living? And sticks with him when she ultimately finds out what a snake he is? For all of De Niro's talent he can't play a tender love scene with Brenneman that is the least bit believable. In the big shootout between De Niro's gang of four, and what looked like the entire LA police force, we are to believe that two of De Niro's gang escaped? And so on.The much ballyhooed scene between Pacino and De Niro has all of the impact of two emotionless middle-aged guys sitting across from each other at a table in a diner spouting lines like, 'You do what you do, and I do what I do,' and 'I don't know how to do anything else.' And then there is the 'my balls are bigger than your balls' moment when each of the two allows as how he will have to take the other down if it comes to a standoff. This scene must account somewhat for why this movie is so popular with young males. The two share accounts of recurring dreams no less (a banquet table populated by dead people for Pacino and drowning for De Niro). There is an implication of bonding in this scene that I found to be a bit ridiculous.We have extraneous side stories thrown in, like Pacino's suicidal stepdaughter and a substitute gang member that turns out to be a serial rapist/murderer on the side.The score by Elliot Goldenthal is generic and transparently manipulative, designed to raise the tension level at appropriate places and frequently announcing how we are supposed to react to a scene.This thing drags on for almost three hours until its inevitable showdown between De Niro and Pacino. There is little new here.",5,7,16,4 April 2009
The Thin Red Line," Odd combination of war, philosophy, poetry, and mysticism
","This movie, ostensibly about the battle for Guadalcanal in WWII, changed gears so often that it often left me baffled. There is the 'war is hell' aspect, and that was well done. I don't think I have ever seen a better presentation of the absolute fear that combat troops can experience; the scenes that had the soldiers packed into landing craft heading for the beach were terrifying. Everyone involved deserves praise for their work on the war part of the movie.Some opening scenes have a couple of AWOL soldiers living a blissful existence on a Pacific island. The native islanders are in tune with nature and each other. It's a real Garden of Eden they have got going there. Malick appears to have some fascination with the idea that such a paradise is possible, or he would like to think so. There is a similar scene in the Indian camps in his 'The New World.' There he explicitly remarks on the perfection of the Indians and their culture. Here the peaceable initial scenes set up a contrast with what the two soldiers are to experience after they are discovered and forced to participate in the battles to come. Concluding scenes that show that the earlier paradise has been shattered are summarized with the voice-over, 'How did we lose the good that was given to us?' If you find such commentary penetrating, then you may like this movie better than I.As is true in four other Malick films I have seen, this one is beautifully filmed. Malick has the eye of an artist. I had some difficulty with the mixing of visual poetry with the horror of war. The beauty of nature is on display and, again, I assume the idea is to contrast that with the ugly battle scenes. This mixing of the sacred and profane does lend power to the comment, 'What's keeping us from reaching out, touching the glory.'For every bit of philosophizing that resonated with me there were many others that seemed rather trivial, such as: 'This great evil, where does it come from?'; 'Nature's cruel'; 'War doesn't ennoble men, it turns them into dogs'; 'Love, where does it come from?' While I realize it is the intent of the movie to bring up such questions, in the context of the immediate existential threats I doubt if any of the soldiers had any more philosophical thoughts than, 'I want out of here,' or 'What am I doing here?'Then there are the mystical elements like the concept that maybe humans are temporary incarnations of some universal soul.Soft classical music being played over grim happenings on screen again sets up a contrast, one that some may find more potent than I did. In any case, I think this effect has run its course, having been used in previous films such as 'The Deer Hunter,' and 'Gallipoli.' The use of such music as Arvo Pärt's 'Annum per Annum,' and Fauré's 'Requiem' can be seen either as pretentious or as adding appropriate gravitas.This is an interesting movie and is certainly not your typical war movie. It was well worth watching but a bit of a mixed bag for me.",7,1,3,15 August 2011
Her," Raises interesting questions, but goes beyond the believable
","Theodore Twombly is coming off of a difficult divorce and buys a product that represents several generations down the road from contemporary smart phones. This product not only can interpret and respond to simple requests, but it can also interact pretty much as if it were human. Theo is asked some basic questions to initialize the device and the next thing you know he is engaged in conversation with the operating system. There are some clever interchanges like when the OS asks if Theo wants to have a female or male voice and he chooses female. Theo then asks the OS what its name is and the answer is 'Samantha.' When he asks how the OS came up with that name it (she) responds that she had searched through several hundred books of names and that is the one she liked the best. The idea that a computer could search through that many books in a few seconds was a good starting point to understand some of Samantha's talents. This is all quite believable, but shortly things start heading into the realm of science fiction (which does not mean that it is beyond imagination) when Samantha starts to develop a human personality. It has been the (mostly unrealized) goal of artificial intelligence to produce machines that can learn from experience and imitate human behavior. Samantha realizes this in being able to learn how to be human. That is well done here as we see Samantha's gradual evolution taking place, ultimately going beyond human experience. When Samantha first comes on as a gently supportive presence I was forced to ask myself just how far I would go along with this if it happened to me. In her early development Samantha would get high marks as a psychiatrist and I could see entertaining her judgments as worthy of consideration. Suppose you were interacting with what you thought was a human only to be told it was a machine? Would you then discount it? When does human/machine interaction go beyond a human's simply regarding a computer as a machine that can be unplugged? Humans do have a tendency for anthropomorphizing even inanimate objects, for example some children's stuffed animals can seem quite real to them and some robots have endeared themselves to people. How far can this be taken?Joaquin Phoenix plays the lonely everyman Theo quite well. I did have a problem with the scene where Theo has a blind date with the sexy Olivia Wilde. She comes on to him so strongly that it was hardly believable that such a beautiful woman would be turned on by such an ordinary man on a first date. Oddly, the star of the move is Scarlett Johansson who is the voice of Samantha. Indeed, it would be hard to resist a computer that had such a pleasing voice. Imagine what this movie would have been if the computer had had the male voice of Jerry Lewis. I rather liked Amy Adams in this and Rooney Mara, as Theo's ex-wife, had a great scene with Theo in a restaurant.I would have liked this movie better if it have stayed on this side of the possibly believable, but it is entertaining as is.",7,0,2,22 June 2014
Donnie Darko," full of sound and fury, signifying nothing
","I give this movie high marks for creating a mood and capturing my imagination, but in the end I felt that there was not much there.  I think this is one of those efforts from the 'If I make it impossible to understand, they will think I am a genius,' school.I liked the fact that the parents were not presented as idiots, as so many parents of teen protagonists are. But where does Donnie get off calling his mother a bitch? Or is this meant to illustrate Donnie's tenuous grasp on reality?I am not averse to complex plots, but when you can put about any interpretation on what happens, then I suspect obscurity for obscurity's sake.  With a bit more focus this could have been a good film, since it has great style, acting, music, photography, and technique.",7,0,0,2 March 2003
The Wizard of Oz," I liked its messages
","I had put off seeing this until recently, when some friends forced me to watch it, refusing to believe that I had not seen it in over fifty years of movie watching. I figured it would be pretty sappy, but I found that there is some substance to it after all.Traveling to a magic and colorful land might be exciting, fun, and interesting, but for most of us I think it's the daily experiences that give us our stability and satisfactions. Turning to an all-powerful being to solve our problems is a misguided effort--that god will be exposed as a sham. We had best turn to ourselves to make our way in this world.",7,1,4,27 May 2013
High Fidelity," Three geeks and some pretty women
","Befitting its title, music plays a big part in this movie, both on the soundtrack and in the story which has three thirty-something, vinyl-obsessed geeks running a music store in Chicago. Rob (John Cusack) is the owner of the store and he is assisted by Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black). Barry is loud, opinionated, and arrogant - if you don't agree with him, then you are beneath contempt. Barry would rather insult a customer who asks for an unapproved record than make a sale. Dick is sensitive, shy, scholarly, and his appreciation for pop-music is sincere. Louiso and Black create vividly articulated, delightful characters.The central plot line has Rob questioning why he has had such bad luck with women and he details his five most significant break-ups. He winds up talking to the camera much of the time. Some may find this intimate and appealing, but it didn't work for me - I would rather have had his neuroses worked out on screen than recited to us. Somewhat early on Rob asks himself the question, 'How does an average guy like me become the number one lover-man in his particular postal district? He's grumpy, he's broke, he hangs out with the musical moron twins.' This question is the one I kept asking about Rob throughout the film and not being able to answer it is the reason I had a hard time swallowing the story. The break-ups Rob describes are with some very attractive women, the most recent being with Laura (the very fetching Iben Hjejle). I completely understood why Laura (a successful lawyer) would move on from Rob and I could not see what she saw in him that made her come back. The music and supporting cast are outstanding and they supply most of the appeal. There are lots of good lines. Consider Barry's reference to the name of his rock group, 'We're no longer called Sonic Death Monkey. We're on the verge of becoming Kathleen Turner Overdrive, but just for tonight, we are Barry Jive and his Uptown Five.' And what a kick it was for me to see that Black can actually sing. But the movie needs to be carried by Cusack and whenever he was on screen I tended to lose interest. At a macro level this is a cautionary tale about trying to turn one's passions into a business. You are most frequently going to be disappointed by the tastes of your customers and will wind up playing to a small audience and having a hell of a time making a go of it.",6,1,3,18 May 2008
Atonement," Top-notch production values, hard to buy the story
","*Spoilers* This story begins in 1935 in a British manor house where we soon meet the three main characters: Briony, a precocious thirteen year old; Cecilia, Briony's elegant older sister; and Robbie, the handsome son of a housemaid. The main themes are set up early on. Cecilia and Robie become romantically involved and Briony's initial jealousy turns into vindictiveness based on some misinterpretations. Toward the end of the story in 1940 we have Robbie in France waiting to be evacuated from Dunkirk. In the interim between 1935 and 1940 Robbie has spent time in jail, due to a lie put forth by Briony--he had been released in order to fight in the war. In 1940 Briony is a nurse who is preoccupied with atoning for her lie and Cecilia, also a nurse, pines for Robbie's return.The period details are well done. The London street scenes seem realistic ('Have a Guiness when you're tired' poster on a London double-decker), the costumes are sumptuous, and the cinematography lavish. The original score by Dario Marianelli is effective and plays a significant role.I could not stay involved since so many scenes did not ring true. I started to have troubles when Cecilia took off her dress and jumped into the fountain--would she have dared do that in plain view? And how would she explain her soaked dress? There is a major problem with Robbie's letter of apology mix-up. We see Robbie crumpling several false starts with his letter, then, rather than crumpling a highly volatile one, he folds it and places it on his desk. He leaves his final version fully exposed on his desk while putting the salacious one in the envelope. Are we really to believe that? If you were to commit such highly sensitive thoughts to paper (a doubtful endeavor in itself), would you not be damned careful that that paper never see the light of day? Robbie gives his letter to Briony for her to deliver; how convenient for the plot, but how hard to believe. Then there are the scenes with the search for the missing boys. Can we be expected to believe that a prosperous businessman would attempt rape while fully aware that a search party was at large in the area? Would Robbie and Cecilia have had sex in the library in such close proximity to the others in the house? They at least closed the door, but then Briony was able to simply push her way in to catch them. Would Cecilia and Robbie's brief attachment have been able to sustain their love for five years while apart? I think such love happens only in romantic movies and novels.The recreation of the retreat from Dunkirk was clearly a considerable undertaking, but the main effect it had on me was to want to do some research as to what the actual historical situation was. This presentation with group sings, carnival rides, drunken bar scenes, and a large-screen cinema seemed too strange to be true. And, unless you have some knowledge of history, the Dunkirk scenes could be confusing. Why were soldiers killing horses and disabling vehicles?Some scenes come out of nowhere without advancing the plot. For example, I could not see what the scene that had Briony tending a wounded French soldier had to do with anything. The horrors of the wounded had already been amply displayed, as well as Briony's empathetic reactions.At the very end there is an interview with an old Briony, played by Vanessa Redgrave. I was able to appreciate Redgrave's outstanding performance, but I have problems with dramas that lead us down a certain path only to pull the rug out from under us at the end.",5,3,6,29 October 2009
