The Blair Witch Project," Terrifying!
",Wow!!! Man I just came home from cinema where I saw that more- than-any-other-scary movie! I just can't believe that you some folks can do such a masterpiece with only a few hand cameras. I love each of the characters but my fave is Josh. I think that the scariest and most terrifying scene is at the end when Heather and Mike are in the house and you can see Mike standing with his face to the wall in a corner of the room! One of the best films ever made!!,10,0,1,5 December 1999
Rosemary's Baby," Satanic!!
","I just finished reading Ira Levin's novel and I think it's really groovy. I'd say as good as the film, maybe even a bit better. In the movie I love Ruth Gordon as Minnie. She is THE actress of the 60's. But also Mia Farrow as Rosemary is a reason to love that film! Sometimes you're asking yourself how somebody can be so pretty but then, in the middle of the film, she scares you - so skinny! But I love that film! 9/10!",10,0,1,5 December 1999
Jaws," The best movie ever made!!!
","What can I say about this man!? I mean Spielberg as its best. Okay, there'll be some guys who're gonna say that I can't compare a 'funny' film like Jaws with a masterpiece like Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan and films like that. Unfortunately I haven't read Benchley's novel but I would love to! It's my all time favorite! 10/10!",10,2,4,27 November 1999
