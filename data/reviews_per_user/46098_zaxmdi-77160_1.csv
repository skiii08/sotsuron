The Lobster," Disturbingly bad
","Disgusting movie. Propped up by the pseudo intellectual critics of the film festivals who's primary aim is to try and appear smart in front of a sea of retards also trying to appear smart. This movie literally made me nauseous. There is a hellish Hitler's Spawn of a scene where a woman describes how she brutally murders a dog and then they actually show the dead dog with its gut kicked out on the bathroom floor. That image was shown for at least 3 seconds and will haunt me for life. The movie is so bleak and dark and disturbed that no form of entertainment can possibly be derived from this by anyone other than those paid, posing, and pretending to see the 'life message'. The life message is that this is total sh*t. Applauded by sh*t. And sold by sh*t. And no one should be subjected to this. Avoid. Tell people to avoid. And seek accountability for this utter assault and rape. I don't use those words loosely. I haven't felt more violated and angered by a film since the repulsive The Killer Inside Me. And even that was a cakewalk in comparison.",1,2,5,13 April 2017
