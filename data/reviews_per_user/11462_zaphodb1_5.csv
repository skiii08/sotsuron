Source Code," The Improbable versus the Impossible
","Well acted, well directed, good character development. Although repeating the train journey several times, it was not repetitive, as each time, the movie explored more of the mystery/puzzle surrounding the circumstances of the main character and the reason for the train journey.The plot revolves around the idea of being able to reconstruct from the memories of the deceased, the last 8 minutes of what they experienced - and injecting this into someone else's brain, so that they experience an 'interactive' environment. While improbable, when this sort of thing turns up in a movie, its called science fiction.The only problem is the ending. Ihe main character is terminated at the end of a train journey sequence, and he then goes on living in an alternative time line. While this is a nice ending, it is not explained, even within the bounds of science fiction, leaving a dissatisfied taste at the end. 7/10",7,1,2,26 October 2012
Citizen Kane," Not that Impressive
","I saw the movie on DVD and again with commentary by Roger Ebert. It is rated as the number 1 movie in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.Orson Wells, child prodigy and coming after his War of the Worlds stunt was given a free hand with this film, his first director role. So it had a lot to live up to. Failed at the box office, but later rediscovered, the film experienced a revival. The story was supposedly based on Hearst, a media Baron (although this was denied by Wells). Hearst went to some lengths to try and ban the film.Looking at it now, it is very dated. It does make some very telling points about human nature and the newspaper business. But I cant help but feel Wells tries too hard at being ground breaking, both in choice of a controversial story and in its cinematography. While the film was ground breaking, I didn't find it was a particularly entertaining film at all.",6,3,8,3 March 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," Revisionist Left Wing Propaganda
","Great story, acting and special effects.Only two problems.1. Its a story about children's fairy tales and contains graphic war violence. Definitely not for children. For adults that like fairy tales, I guess.2. The second issue is the political message. Gratuitous violence (murder and torture) is perpetrated by the fascist military in the film. The good guys are the communist rebels. Looking at the history of Spain in 1944, each side was equally violent. The film does not portray a balanced view and has the communist side winning, which was not the case.The Franco regime was authoritarian, locked up, killed and exiled thousands of political prisoners. The other side was just as barbaric however, but lost. Spain was neutral, favouring Germany in the 2nd World War, ostracised by the UN in 1945, allied with the US against communism in 1953, experienced an economic boom in 1959 and became a democratic and constitution monarchy in 1975 (Franco's death after anointing the King). In the end the Franco regime fizzled out, but was not overthrown.The film is an attempt to adjust Spain's history to say that the Fascist regime was the only side to commit human rights atrocities.The DVD should contain a warning label: 'This film contains material that is Revisionist Left Wing Propaganda'",5,1,11,24 November 2012
JFK," An Unfortunate Episode in US National and Political Affairs
","JFK is based on two books – On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot that Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs. JFK sets the scene by showing an historical account of Kennedy's Presidency, from the Bay of Pigs invasion, through to the Cuban missile crisis and finally Kennedy's assassination. The film then covers the background leading to the assassination including the planning of a second Cuban invasion by a group of ex-Cubans, Lee Harvey Oswald and his defection to Russia and return to the USA and his relationship to the ex-Cubans and Guy Bannister – ex FBI agent and investigator. The film then follows Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner), the New Orleans District Attorney who in 1966 disagreed with the Warren Commission's finding of a lone assassin, and re-opens the Kennedy assassination and attempts to convict Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) of involvement. The film shows Garrison's attempts to reconstruct the assassination, his interviews with witnesses and his personal life. Garrison also has a meeting with a Government official (Mr X) who explains the big picture of a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy and encourages Garrison to keep digging. Garrison uses the trial, via his summing up speech, as a vehicle to attack the findings of the Warren Commission, alleging a cover-up, including asserting that there were multiple gunmen and alleging a conspiracy of the military-industrial complex.As a film, I found it too long, a little slow initially and the use of quick cuts and low camera angles, a little excessive. The film is notable for attracting a star studded cast, including several cameo appearances. Interestingly of all the A-list actor appearances, all but Gary Oldman are Democrat leaning.However what cannot be overlooked is the film's statement, which is remarkable. The film attracted a lot of controversy, interestingly including from the press. The Warren Commission did make a lot of errors and while the film is an interpretation of the available facts and reasonable assumptions, with some modification for storytelling effect, it seems the true story may never be told. The film is perfectly valid in attempting to highlight the inconsistencies of the official account of Kennedy's assassination with assumptions/facts.We now know that the CIA at the time was involved in destabilising a number of other countries leadership in the name of the cold war. Kennedy did try and remove covert activities from the CIA and transfer them to the US military. There were also many suspicious deaths of witnesses of the Kennedy assassination, probably to prevent Garrison's use in his court case. And there also was the assassination of Bobby Kennedy after he nominated for President and outlined that he would follow in his brother's footsteps.On the balance of probabilities, it is very likely that there was a cover-up of Kennedy's assassination. To this day, the true killers have not been brought to justice. Does it matter. America won the Cold War, and even Democrat Presidents now endorse the tactics of the CIA and the Pentagon (eg the drone killings and the recent revelations by Edward Snowden about the US spying on its own citizens and other countries – both presided over by Obama). So perhaps Kennedy was naive and was wrong to try and tame the CIA. It is in the least, an unfortunate episode in US national and political affairs.",7,1,8,14 July 2013
Looper," Loopy
","Looper is set in a mob controlled society in the not too distant future. The mob use 'loopers' to carry out death sentences by transporting the victims back in time to a pre-arranged time and place. When their usefulness is over, loopers themselves are transported back in time to be terminated by their younger selves (closing the loop). If a looper fails to complete the termination, the looper then becomes a target. A new mob leader takes over all 5 mob syndicates and orders all loopers to be terminated. This leads to an attempt by one looper to use time travel to prevent the mob leader taking over.Overall the movie is good. There is action, suspense and good acting.The time travel used in the movie leaves a few people scratching their heads. When a looper fails to close the loop, they change their own history. If they kill their older selves, they get paid out and retire, whereas if they fail, they are tracked down and killed. The movie is confusing in the way it shows both possibilities taking place at the same time. Also, no one knows if the paradox of changing your own history (grandfather paradox) is even allowed in our universe. This includes meeting yourself (to close the loop).Another issue is Joseph Gordon-Levitt is supposed to be a young Bruce Willis. Everyone knows what Bruce Willis looked like 30 years ago from Die Hard (well 25 years ago). Gordon-Levitt looks nothing like him - this failed for me.And what is it with Bruce Willis and aspirin.Some of the story elements are far fetched. The time transportation devices used in the film can transport in space and time. It would be easier to transport someone a few kilometres underground than elaborately transporting them back in time to be killed.So what score to give it? Has a few deficiencies but Bruce Willis is in it - 7/10.",7,2,3,26 April 2013
