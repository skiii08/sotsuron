Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny to most people.
","This was a very good film. As I am only 13, I probably wouldn't understand it as much as older people would, but wow. It does take some getting into, but it's very funny, and despite the fact it's a mockumentary, it comes quite close to being a documentary, as the reactions of real people are almost totally realistic.And did you know how politically incorrect America is? A Rodeo guy tells Borat to shave off his moustache (because he looks like a Muslim) and some guy gives him a gun specifically designed to kill Jews, this film gives you an insight of American Prejudises.Then there's the Bad part. Many people just will not find this film funny. I cannot Guarantee you will. I did, most people do, but you might not. some people just don't. Just a warning. The only way to find out is go and see.But all in all, with outrageous sexist, racist and everythingist humour and an amazing naked fight scene, this movie will disgust you, amaze you and probably (and hopefully) make you laugh.",9,0,4,18 November 2007
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Offencive humor indeed.
","I have always been a South Park fan, but I never really understood the movie, in other words, I thought it was pretty naff. I've re-watched it recently, and I have formed a new opinion of it. Mainly because I watched it with my mum, I realised it wasn't just the show in a movie. No, far from it. For one, the story is far more well worked. For those who didn't know, the story in this film is next to identical to the B-story in the episode 'Death' on the first season of South Park, but with a twist. For one, it gets even more violent at the end, and two, it has a lot more swearing than the show, and even the stronger words go unbleeped, which brings me onto my second point. For those who were born when Monty Python's meaning of life came out, and when you think how disgusted people were by that, look at this. It contains one hundred and forty-something f-words, and plenty of violence, sex, and things like that throughout. And just like Meaning of Life, it remains funny. But it's also very very smart. It gets some political and social issues about bad influence for kids, and quite ironically provides a good hour and a half's worth. So yeah, buy it and watch it, It will probably offend you, if you share my belief in God, your'll be offended by the Mole, but then, so what? This movie is supposed to offend. Just sit back and enjoy it. And don't watch it with your mum. It's not a great idea.",9,0,1,20 March 2008
Shrek the Third," Good film
","I think everyone had high expectations of this movie, I mean, after the first movie, then the second beat the first, so we all thought that the third would be brilliant, and granted, this didn't fulfil that, but so what? It still did a great job as a movie, and was quite fun. Didn't beat number two though, as it didn't live up to some of the slightly crude humour. But anyway, good film. The other disappointing this about this movie is that several of the characters were annoying and you wanted them to get hurt, for example, Merlin, but he didn't. Things like that got annoying, and the Arther kid they brought into the movie was kinda annoying as well. But all in all, this is an entertaining film, just tone down your expectations slightly.",8,3,4,27 December 2007
Beowulf," Don't let this become a sub genre. PLEASE!
","I saw this film in 3D, and it entertained me. Unfortunately, it did little more than entertained me. To be honest, it either seems like this was a style rip-off of 300, or Frank Miller's unique style is going to become a genre. Another battle based CGI historic thing isn't really what we need. It did have some originality though, with the way it seemed like it was about something which kept coming back, in different forms, usually, but it all seemed abit messy. Not only that, but it had several anti-religious messages throughout the film, and they were all kind of arrogant pagan/atheist ones. It was just generally abit of a dodgy film, and it kind of ripped off 300, which, for anyones's information, is brilliant. All in all, see this film if you wish, but be warned.p.s. 3D Glasses give you a headache.",4,1,3,5 January 2008
