Alien 3," Loss of tension
","The 3rd in a series of 4 fantastic sci-fi films, although it is probably the worst one. Why do I think this? It loses half the tension of the previous two films as you learn through the film that Ripley is basically untouchable to the aliens. This is because she has a queen alien inside her and the aliens want the queen alive. However, the film redeems some tension through the other characters. There are some good special effects and bloody deaths, all the usuals from the alien quadrilogy. Ripley supports a shaved head in the film in order to keep the horny male prisoners back making her look very tough and adds a different look to the film. A good ending resulting in the death of Ripley but hey, who cares she comes back! Definitely worth watching in a dark room for the first viewing.",8,2,3,22 March 2006
