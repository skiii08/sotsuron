The Devil's Advocate," An interesting case of genre hybridity but Reeves' lead and some generally jumbled scenes cannot hold the film together too greatly.
","Who would've thought the merging of the horror genre with the legal thriller would actually threaten to half work? That's exactly the feeling that eerily dawns on you about half way to two thirds of the way through The Devil's Advocate, a film that uses whatever few scares and un-canniness it carries at the best of times to disorientate and make the viewer uneasy  less is very much more in this film and it works well on an emotional level. The scenes I'm referring to of course are when a certain Mary Ann Lomax (Theron) catches a glimpse of what a couple of high price law firm employees actually are, and that is pure evil in the from of a stick thin but pretty none-the-less female masquerading. They are scenes that zone the viewer out of the legal thriller genre and into a different, unexpected realm; a realm of horror.But these scenes are few and far in-between and are moulded around a lead named Kevin Lomax, Mary Ann's husband, played by Keanu Reeves. The annoying bit about this is that Reeves cannot quite carry the film on his own and does not possess the necessary acting qualities required to drive the bizarre, hybrid beast that is The Devil's Advocate thus rendering it an ordinary and somewhat bland story about a possible apocalypse when it could've been an interesting and, dare I say, groundbreaking film that people might have still been talking about today for reasons other than the fact Pacino, Reeves and Theron are in it.But some of this is down to the telling of the story and a slice of the direction. There is no obvious structure to the film, which isn't a bad thing, but the repetition of the establishing of the new world Kevin inhabits when he arrives in the 'big city' from his rural, old fashioned dwellings drag on a bit and the film takes a while in getting to the meat that will make up the film, that being a murder trial whose suspect is supposedly innocent and guess what; Kevin is put on the job. The Devil's Advocate's priorities seem to be in the right places. The film is a fish out of water story at the be all and end all of it, but it establishes Kevin as a man with a slight religious persona, something that the film utilises when it comes to dealing with the evil that certain other characters possess later on. This makes for good 'jump' scenes or moments in which the character we map onto gets a good freight, as do we. Kevin's slight religious background acts as a catalyst for certain 'feelings' and sensations he gets later on and they work relatively well, cinematically.The film sees Kevin leave his Florida roots with his wife Mary-Ann for New York City. If ever there was a place in America to set a film about a newcomer or a 'fish out of water' arriving in new territory then it's New York. His new boss is John Milton, Al Pacino in a 'rant role', but it's all a façade for greater things. Milton is an odd individual but Pacino plays him perfectly. He's egotistical and outgoing, exclaiming things at the top of his voice with the sort of confidence that suggests he's been everywhere and done everything and anything he says is probably dead right anyway.So in this male dominated world of lawyers and suit wearing business officials that inhabit courtrooms and offices, what of the women and Kevin's other half in particular? It's interesting to note that Mary-Ann exists to be a ditzy and somewhat stupid blonde woman who we begin disliking through annoyance but gradually come to feel sorry for as events play out. On the other hand, the mysterious female associates to Milton and his company exist to go shopping and get their breasts out. But this underestimates the film because underneath there is a fair amount of seduction and evil going on between the women. Women have never got a fair crack in either the legal thriller genre nor indeed the horror genre so for them to undergo (in Mary-Ann's case) the psychological horrors and changes they do is impressive in a certain sense.But again, acting pulls the film down. Charlize Theron sees fit to shriek a lot and act in a very odd manner as the psychological study sets in  she is one fish not enjoying her time out of the water and it tells much later on. But then the shrieking and the eccentric behaviour when not a lot has really happened to drive her that way takes over. Was it the obsession in choosing a certain paint colour? Loneliness? Has all the shopping worn her out and forced her to hallucinate? It all sounds, and feels, a little messy. The bulk of the film is Pacino and Reeves swanning around business parties, interacting with pretty women in expensive suites. Kevin resists certain sins such as lust and greed as his journey goes on but has a few tiffs with his wife along the way. While the film isn't spectacular in any sense and the ending is disappointing, the film retains an interest and its hook of combining the two genres it does acts as a nice anchor throughout but the acting and general content of real note feels out of sorts rendering the film a pretty good exercise but nothing particularly memorable in the long run.",6,0,2,3 November 2008
The King's Speech," Rather than stammer in its paces, The King's Speech is a wondrously concise and pleasingly executed piece enrapturing us in the plight of its lead.
","With The King's Speech, rising British director Tom Hooper revisits some familiar thematic ground upon which he had previously trodden with his 2009 feature The Damned United; specifically, his multi-award winning, and highly acclaimed class-comedy posing as a period/costume drama, zeroes in on a chapter more inclined towards failure or fault. This chapter of such things within the life of an individual one may, or may not, have heard an awful lot about, and yet are coerced into recognising a certain amount of fame or success prominent in their legacy, is the subject for The King's Speech, an impressive and wonderfully taut film rich in comedy as well as crackling dialogue delivered with aplomb by those therein.Principally, the core item either film share is that the respective pieces are about chapters in the predominantly rich in incident, and plentiful in most other things, lives of two people built on failure and revolving around strife or struggles seemingly out of sync with everything else. Hooper's 2009 film The Damned United covered the exploits of a man with a wonderful stature and esteemed ability in the field of football management, he being Brian Clough; the film about a chapter of inadequateness with a football squad whom it was seemingly impossible not to garner some kind of success with, around which Clough's managerial career has passed into legend.Here and now, with this Best Picture and BAFTA Best Film as-well-as-mostly-everything-else-under-the-sun winner from the crossover awards year 2010 to 2011, we observe the covering of that of Colin Firth's Prince Albert, later as George whilst King in an attempt to veer away from the 'Germanic' roots of his Christian name, and his terrifying speech impediment that he had for as long as he could remember going a long way to rendering public speaking and radio broadcasts near-impossible. The short of it is that the film is as much a success as both Hooper's previous effort and most of what the buzz makes out of it, a film adhering to those writings of not-so-long-ago that most, if not all, of Britain's comedy is entirely imbued with a sense of class distinction or class clashing, but a telling of a rousing tale about a man confronting his fears or problems or demons, located wholly within himself, before gunning to win through in the end.It is 1930s Britain, George V (Gambon) sits atop the throne over the British Isles and its Commonwealth with his son Edward (Pearce) lying in wait ahead of our Albert, whose problems with speaking, both publicly and privately, see all manner of social interaction with family and friends often go awry. We begin with a microphone dominating the screen, its presence overbearing and its sheer size magnified to overly dramatic affect, so much so that a longer shot of the room it is in dwarfs it in comparison thus revealing the honesty of its nature. A gentleman is ready to go on the air and is going through his regimented routine whilst making the entire process look very easy; an establishment of specialists in this field doing what they do and managing to tone down the intimidating presence of the microphone into something else feeling prominent. The sequence is in stark contrast to that of our inception into Albert's world of speaking, doing as such at Wembley Stadium, no less, on a cold day drenched in grey cinematography and failing to make what has just been established as the respectable grade. This attempt at an expansive speech proves to be the final straw, Albert's, or Bertie to his close companions, wife Elizabeth (Bonham Carter), The Duchess of York, then going on to seek the help Albert needs.This help arrives in the form of Geoffrey Rush's all but show-stealing turn as Lionel Logue, a true to life Australian speech therapist whose base of operations is quite literally down in the depths of a building accessible only by cramped elevator. The Duchess has heard of certain buzzwords relating to Logue she usually looks upon with scorn; class distinctions and the physical necessity for the royals to have to literally 'descend' to Logue's class level in speaking to him prominent. Upon initially meeting him, he skips out of his lavatory and speaks freely towards her; later visits from Albert seeing Hooper shoot Firth's character with a ropey, dull background of peeling wallpaper and such whilst Logue is allowed all the richness and activity of furniture as well as the rest of his abode behind him – where class has previously been used to cite distinctions between one and the other, it is Logue whom Albert is frequenting for aid and their respective distinctions here are broken apart.With Logue arrives his free-speaking and outlandish methods, of which persistently and really effectively blur lines between what are merely his methods and what might be mere arrogance; the seeds for such prejudices over that of the rich arriving when Logue is cast away by a stage director whom dismisses him during an stage reenactment despite Logue's fruitful credentials in playing the part. Around all of this brew the events which will push Albert into a stark confrontation with his issue, a going up against what it is his weakness is with what he'll have learnt as well as fought through the means of combating everything. George V's ever-deteriorating health and the fact it looks increasingly likely Edward will not make for a decent monarch but for his playboy lifestyle infused ways combine with George's own literal reiteration of the abilities one will require in calming a nation that'll be brought to its knees if the correct things are not said, done and related to as background stuff brewing on the Continent unfolds. Hooper's film is a resounding, pleasing cinematic spectacle; the bringing to life of a tale from decades ago and telling it with the sort of pathos and confidence that is entirely welcome.",7,0,0,16 June 2011
The Avengers," Very little to Marvel at here - a somewhat tame effort with an odd chuckle and a decent stunt, but mostly underwhelming.
","When we observe a supporting character, a mere mortal – a defenceless human-being, in Joss Whedon's 'Marvel: Avengers Assemble' decide to single-handedly take on a near-indestructible son of a God, purely so as to come to the aid of a SECOND son of God, who is trapped inside a glass box, although has at his disposal a large hammer, and indeed pays for it with their life, you know you're not mining particularly intelligent territory.This largely disappointing 2012 effort begins in a quasi-Area 51 style military base where a mysterious blue cube is pulsating enough for a race of monsters, who dress like the creatures in 'Stargate' but look like something you might have caught in an episode of 'Power Rangers', located on the other side of the universe to be attracted to it. Like Stargate, although with the roles here reversed, Tom Hiddleston's Loki (turns out Nordic mythology was the one, true religion) emerges from a portal created by the cube into this top secret laboratory and steals the cube in order to fabricate it so that the rest of the war mongering creatures can come through at a later date to destroy all human life.A measure as to his menace and ability is put across in two ways: first, the ease to which he neuters the human beings – finding no threat in automatic weaponry and 'converting' them to his cause through a magic staff. Second, the way in which he is framed so as to encompass an eagle-like emblem in the background (actually the badge of the good guys) as he utters 'Freedom is life's great lie...' – something designed to invoke a Hitler-like personality with what resembles the German 'National Adler' behind him.Later on, there will be a strange allusion to Nazi Germany again when, in Germany of all places, he forces a score of German citizens to kneel before him, with one brave citizen standing up and making some allusion to how there will 'always exist people like you' people who 'want power'. Had it been me, I would have cited a very famous remark, actually made famous in the twentieth century by a Communist, which goes: 'It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees'. Had I still been in one piece to offer a further retort, I would have recommended he hop on over to the Middle East, where they're heavily into sprawling themselves out on the floor because a deity tells them to. Loki's philosophy on human existence essentially being one of desiring submission would be right at home.But nobody watching Marvel: Avengers Assemble will know of anything about German life between the wars, nor will they have heard of the Versailles Treaty, nor that Hitler commanded not for people to kneel before him, merely salute out of respect and recognise that his policies had made Germany a nation that was rich enough to fool itself into thinking the Great War never even happened.After Loki's theft, an otherwise needless character played by Samuel L. Jackson, whose purpose in the film is to look cool wearing an eye-patch and firing a bazooka, gets together a string of superheroes whom have each had their own blockbusters from as recently as 2008. These are the titular Avengers, although what they are 'avenging', we do not know and the film's title card appears on the screen as if itself a response to a character's asking 'What do we do?' following Loki's theft of the cube doomsday device. Given this, the film ought to be entitled 'Assemble (the) Avengers'. Tossed in is an archer and an expert in kung-fu, because they offer an alternative way to kill an enemy to the main heroes, who can do nothing more than keep blowing them up or swatting them away with their power.The film is mostly noise, but good looking noise; made more bearable by the wonderful editing during the action sequences, particularly when a flying battleship loses its ability to fly mid-air and New York City is besieged during the finale, wherein it is clear what each of our protagonists are doing; where they are in relation to each other and how they are going about fulfilling their tasks amidst the elements. The film is essentially Superman II with multiple Supermen; a concoction of 1994's 'Street Fighter', wherein each character is designated a fight with every other one, despite some of them being on the same side, with Stephen Norrington's damp 2003 squib 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'.I don't mind action films, but action films with a great deal of special effects are often somewhat tiresome affairs. This 2012 feature is no exception here. Over the last 25 years, Hollywood has proved time and time again that the best action films carry with them that grounded sense of base-level operation being propelled by realistic heroes. This is why the street; highway and inner-city set event movies of a 'Speed' or a 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance' will always be superior to a Marvel: Avengers Assemble, films that do not rely on a tremendous amount of special effects but provide you with enough chase; pomp and bullet-time to have you feel as if you are caught in a crossfire.Should be unfortunate to catch this good looking, although ultimately vacuous, 2012 feature, I sense you will be disappointed. I was left dissatisfied in being asked to believe that there could exist a form of authentic theism AND the existence of an alien species elsewhere in the universe without any of it being explored; left perplexed at the tremendous amount of science on display, in Iron Man's suit and Bruce Banner's fascinating ability to shift into a separate molecular form – the likes of which essentially smashes the concept of creationism. It is harmless; inoffensive and does indeed fly past nicely, but there's nothing here to get excited about.",5,2,8,31 December 2014
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Let's just stop with the kiddie orientated Disney franchises, shall we?
","They tagline for this film could've been 'National Treasure 2  This time it's personal' considering it revolves around the Gates family named being accused of a dark history. But then again, they must've realised 'National Treasure 2  This time it's personal' just sounds silly. Wait a minute, something to do with a National Treasure film deemed 'too silly'? Well, I never. Truth is, National Treasure: Book of Secrets is so bad that with about twenty minutes to go you just have to accept the garbage being churned out to you and hope it will all soon be over. The film isn't painful in the sense there is nothing to read into nor is it a disaster in the sense the film fails from scene one and doesn't let up alá Batman & Robin or Thunderbirds but it still grates and grates in its own way.In fact with the National Treasure films, I am quickly developing another natural hatred of a Disney franchise; a hatred that began in the Summer of 2006 when I saw the first Pirates of the Caribbean film and quickly cottoned onto the masses of followers who just seem too brainwashed by the actors, pacing and 'fun' the films offer to even notice how crap it was. Then there was this, National Treasure: Book of Secrets. Nicolas Cage is back as Ben Gates but as I said, this time it's personal because his family name has been shamed and accused as a conspirer to President Lincoln's death. His adventure to clear the name and to find the truth will see him travel to the Oval Office in the White House; the Queen's desk in Buckingham Palace and it will see him meet and greet the current American President in search for what separates fact from fiction. I can only guess that these scenes are supposed to act as some sort of dramatic series of events in location's we very rarely see in films. I can say that not only are they unspectacular but they are also contrived and anticlimactic  you mean to tell me that in the Queen of England's desk there was a secret code hidden all this time? What about the President's desk? There was something in there the entire time and nobody found it? Suspending disbelief has never been so necessary.But along this time to help him is his old buddy Riley (Bartha) and his girlfriend Abigail (Kruger); both characters serve their silly purpose as they did in the first film. Riley is un-funny comic relief (people keep mistaking him for Gates and he cannot sell his book. Also, his car is towed  how hilarious) and Abigail is the pretty to look at, innocent, 'Eurotrash' girl who does what she's supposed to do and says what she's supposed to say while kissing and 'exposing' herself at timed intervals when she has to. But it's not just these two that are along for the ride because this time, Ben has brought the folks. John Voight is back as the father in an attempt to try and resurrect a career that had flagged since Mission: Impossible and Helen Mirren is the Brit typically cast as the intellectual of the bunch, playing Ben's mother. A big problem with these characters is that they do not exist to be developed; they exist for mere comic relief that is never funny. Emily (Mirren) and Patrick's (Voight) bickering runs parallel with Ben and Abigail's falling out and it is the common-denominator in treasure hunting that threatens to bring them all back together again as a happy family.So the adventure sees them propelled through Paris complete with funny looking French policemen who show up on bicycles (yes, proper push bikes) and act in an oblivious manner; it sees them propelled to London during which I actually took offence to Cage's impression of an Englishman as he rolls out the accent and the clichés before outsmarting the British police who are equally inept. The journey will see them visit a White House ball during which Gates will succeed in a ludicrous plan to get the President in a location one-on-one before the film finally has the gang getting very wet in an underground cavern accessible only by randomly pouring water on the rocks outside.The film is a failure with its narrative that is loose and uneven and its characters that exist to meekly attempt to make us laugh. An example of the loose plotting is evident in the element of the book. It is a book that only the president knows of and yet the idea to look for this book is spawned from Riley's novel. How does Riley know of the book in the first place if it's only passed on from President to President? The domestic situation between Ben's parents is silly and unneeded and the payoff to their relationship is equally anti-climatic. Ed Harris lacks any sort of charisma or menace to play a good villain in this film and his scenes just while away into acts of nothingness. The films wants to think that Abigail kissing the white house official in the Oval Office just as Ben finds what he needs is 'funny' and the characters in general rely too much on technology to see them home; scenes like the button that 'pops the trunk' and the overuse of computers and phones are examples. The product placement of Fullers London Pride, Mercedes Benz and especially Apple Computers is shameful as is the feeling you'll get at the end of the film when you realise you just sat through it.",4,6,9,5 June 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Marred by its sporadic nature and constant post-modern references but it offers a few brief, if effective, scenes of a harrowing and heart wrenching nature.
","The second volume of Kill Bill marks Tarantino's first failing as a director; it's a minute failing but it's a failing all the same. What is Kill Bill: Volume 2 other than a nicely shot and well acted freak show that follows a revenge story arc but not really as we know it? By the time we are within sight of the finish line, we will have encountered eighty year old pimps sitting and chatting in chairs mumbling about where a certain someone is; we will have encountered Bill, after he was kept anonymous in the first film, playing a pipe of some sort and we will have spent a couple of scenes with a former international assassin who's now living out his days as a Redneck.It's these sorts of people and these sorts of scenes that make Kill Bill: Volume 2 the mismatch film that it is. It's a lot of good ideas and one or two harrowing scenes basically patched together around a basic revenge goal. The film is not the complete experience but then again the film was chopped into two halves anyway and the result is one part brilliant, brutal and engaging (volume 1); one part drawn out, slow and unrewarding (volume 2).You remember individual scenes from Volume 2, you don't remember the full product as an experience. Sure, the burial scene is harrowing and the scene in which The Bride (Thurman) has a certain encounter with a certain someone nearer the end will tug at a lot of people's heartstrings and the sure, individual shots of The Bride walking amongst the heat wave and the bizarre crash zooms into Pai Mei's (Hui Liu) face as a he strokes his beard in a nonchalant fashion stay with you for reasons of a sporadic nature. These moments are memorable, if not rather good but the frustrations lie in the referencing to other texts for the sake of being post-modern and the consistency with the characters.Bending the lines between reality, fantasy, realism and escapism; The Bride sits in a car and delivers a monologue to the camera about how she's going to 'Kill Bill' at the film's very beginning. She even makes a comparison between herself and a movie, likening herself to a 'roaring rampage of revenge' reminding us that this is just a film after all. Then Tarantino chucks in what he does best in terms of manipulating narratives and that's including flashbacks as well as flashbacks within flashbacks. The Bride's first encounter with Bill (Carradine) and the general scenes around the wedding chapel early on work well through the menace Bill brings to the screen. It's effective because we know thanks to the first film what's to come, it is a matter of getting to that point and how it all plays out that is the suspense. Even stranger, Bill comes across as relatively well mannered, even nice, with his soft tone and slow, relatively passive movements that further create illusions of his true persona. It's no coincidence Tarantino selects the side angle when the two come face to face for the first time – the sort of composition that creates that 'face off' scenario.Additionally, Tarantino gives space to Budd (Masden) to grow ever so slightly. Budd's early interaction with his boss for being late for his shift at work leads us down a route of possible confrontation but Budd is passive and lacks that killer instinct – something we wouldn't associate with an assassin. This makes his lack of ruthlessness toward The Bride later on all the more effective and instead, we get a harrowing burial scene rather than an upfront execution. All the villains in the film are sadistic but simplistic; they manage to think up crude and downright nasty ways to eliminate their foes, be it a live burial or a snake in a briefcase but there doesn't seem to be any real flow to it all.The antagonism flits around the place; in volume 1 Bill is a mysterious unseen figure of all thigs sadistic, the next he is playing a flute by a campfire. Tarantino deployed this tactic in Pulp Fiction with Marcellus Wallace and it worked even when we finally saw his face, but here it falls rather flat. The film is a freak show of one eyed kung-fu femme fatales; 80 year old pimps whose whores have populated nearby villages with their young, thus taking the surrounding areas for the old man and comic book spouting psychopaths who have developed their own truth serum. The truth to this is that I think Tarantino gets carried away with himself – it's as if he reaches a certain height and then tries to top himself further with more outlandish content. This is particularly significant towards the end when Bill's luxurious house plays out as the setting for the final confrontation, but it's more of a circus than a bad guy's lair.Some of the best scenes are scrubbed out by some of the more unbelievable and just plain silly. The Bride's interaction with an assassin in a hotel room feels awkwardly out of place and just plain daft whereas Pai Mei's constant laughing and beard stroking to crash zooms feels like a pastiche too far, no matter how potentially enjoyable in a guilty manner. But that's the key word: 'potentially'. The film feels like a missed opportunity, a film that with a calmer head and a more focused eye might have been pretty good. As it is, it's good in individual sections but actually pretty forgettable in the long run.",6,3,7,25 November 2008
Black Swan," Grim, perturbing and morbidly fascinating goings-on at a ballet school, as the battle for a role in a prestigious play reach new levels of impoverishment.
","Black Swan begins its tumultuous, turbulent, rampageous descent into all things maddening and unravelling with some mischievous, border-line evil, cackling behind the quaint and elegant sounds of a ballet score which overlies the opening credits. That idea that something rather nasty, even devious or underhand, to a greater extent lurks behind the entire medium made up of magnificence or grace is alluded to as the piece opens; the film going on to depict a chapter in a person's life fraught with madness, hallucination and a brand of professionalism which forces them to alienate themselves from their surroundings. Director Aronofsky's Black Swan is this film; a stupendous thriller covering the getting under of the subject material at hand and the demythifying the norm whilst filtering a very beautiful surface world through a human's paranoid and sexually repressed subconscious.That human is Natalie Portman's Nina Sayers, a young New York based woman whom works with a ballet group and lives with her mother. As an expansive and adventurous dance number comes to a crashing, crescendo-ridden close post-credits, she wakes up; the seeing of herself in a dream executing an extravagant dance sequence with another performer in full-on garb rounded off with a deep sigh in the here-and-now, a heavy sigh carrying with it an air of regret, as if it were a number she wishes she could envisage herself doing in reality. Nina lives with her mother in an apartment, her designated room carrying with it airs of innocence; of a child-like mentality imbued with pink wallpaper and numerous stuffed toys dotted around, the relationship with her mother Erica, played by Barbara Hershey, very much suggesting one of an infantile nature which has not been allowed to naturally progress and has been reigned in – a somewhat revealing scene in which she suggests she should cut her nails for her suggesting as such.At her ballet school, the announcement of the performing of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake acts as the catalyst for severe changes to undergo; an effective and workmanlike dancer on in her own right, Nina's part in the play is without question but the specific role she's to play remains mysterious. This decision lies with Vincent Cassel's slimy, egotistical, lecherous dance manager Thomas Leroy; a man whom when we first see him towers over all in an auditorium, an entire practise session pausing for his presence and his reason for being there as he lays out specifics for the upcoming show: a man with an mysteriously sordid back-story to do with an ex-pupil of his looming over his character's proceedings.Nina's ability sees her one of the shoe-ins for the role of the white swan, but the true chalice lies in the form of the role of the titular black swan; the role within the piece that sees the character therein transform, indeed mutate, from one extreme to another – with it, arriving a more aggressive, more combative and more outlandish array of characteristics that demands dancing skills of similar ilk. Nina eventually undertakes the quest to land said role, but Leroy outlines the changes she needs to undergo; her principal threat to loosing that black swan role in the form of Mila Kunis' Lily, a girl of binary opposition to Nina; a performer whom turns up late for practise in comparison to Nina's diligence to get there early; a person whose carefree attitude is in stark comparison to Nina's precise and measured approach to her dancing and an individual whose answering back and general extroverted philosophy goes against Nina's softly spoken demeanour.The film is a bleak but stylish and wholly nourishing descent into the rather twisted world of ballet and performance; the ugliness lurking behind that facade of exhibition and beauty and elegance dutifully explored in a thoroughly engaging fashion. Aronofsky litters his films with mirrors; has his characters gaze into mirrors; has them peer at themselves and, on occasion, has their reflections react before peering straight back. Amidst the dance halls lined with glass and the washrooms featuring smaller versions situated above sinks, it is the mirror occupying the entrance hallway to Nina and mother's apartment which gives the greatest clue as to Aronofsky's attempt at getting under the skins of these people though reflective material: said mirror appearing cracked or distorted in its style without having been physically broken; its presence symptomatic of Nina and Lily's arrival there fresh from a night out whose aim for some it was, quite literally, to try and smash Nina's persona so that she may change for the role.What Aronofsky etches out of his cast, predominantly of the two female leads, is nothing short of rather extraordinary. In regards to Kunis, we observe her part in 2008's Max Payne and that she was out horribly miscast in a role which demanded presence and conviction; a role that required her to exist in a simmering situation with little in the way of remorse to most around her but not shy at attempting to befriend one of those caught up in it if it meant personal gain. Her performance was somewhat nearing the ranks of terrible; here, and granted the short gap between films, what Aronofsky does is have her play near enough a similar role to that of the temptress, albeit filtered through the subconscious of someone else, but having her do so with far more conviction leading one into suspecting it was the fault of the man in charge of her in the debacle that was Max Payne when we observe what she pulls off here. Portman's Oscar win essentially arriving off the back of a role which is all about the ability to fall into a specific character or act; the part of Nina very much about performance and the desire to get into character and wholly infused with that field of performance and bringing to life a complexion - the end result being a rather taut and quite frightening experience worthy of its praise.",8,0,1,6 May 2011
Changeling," Thoroughly impressive and thrilling, chilling depiction of a true story brought to the screen with emotion and study.
","Chageling is a wonderful film; a harrowing scenario stretched agonisingly out to two and a bit hours without a moment that is ever really without either fear, hope, pain or anything particularly uninteresting. It's a tale of dedication; of facing one's fear and truly persisting in what you know is just, even if everyone else seems to think otherwise. And boy, do a lot of supporting characters think otherwise; continuously trying to beat the lead back down, a pounding into submission; an assault on the emotions; a dangling of the proverbial carrot in front of them with the promise of their old life back, plus one thing that wasn't there before filling in for something that now isn't. Freedom and 'normality' is so close, yet justice and the righteous scenario is so far away.The film is effortless; effortless in its progression from an everyday mother and son; to a disappearance; to a re-appearance; to a might-be study of madness; to the dedication of a detective and then onto the harrowing conclusion. You'll get angry; you'll feel sad; you'll feel frustrated, only not at the film itself, before settling with an emotion that is somewhere in between everything: a sort of acceptance. The lead is Christine Collins (Jolie), a supervisor at a local branch of a national telephone company whom lives alone with her son Michael in a small house in Los Angels, circa the 1920s. As a lead, we're led to believe she embodies a number of characteristics: individualism, professionalism, but most importantly, dedication. Very early on, a senior individual at the telephone company Christine works at commends her for the level of her recent work, and it is briefly established how well she's done in defying her, what we assume to be, ego driven male doubters whom work in the nether regions of the company.Within the narrow corridors and wired-up rooms of her workspace, Collins bosses her female workmates and dominates what is hard, fast paced work that needs a lot of dedication, love and attention to get the verbal results she is given early on. What follows, rather interestingly, is a taking out of this supposed groove on Christine's behalf when the male led LAPD just about manages to sign her life away and put her on misery row. What was an office-set life of dedication against what might be perceived as male oppressors in a feminist-less set world is escalated into the rest of the world as the actual police department of the city of Los Angels, and then the government itself, is taken on by this one woman and her dedicated hunt for the mere truth.Director Eastwood treats the supposed repression of a strong, truthful female voice in exceptional taste. He tells a plight, a journey through the grinder that sees police station interrogation rooms; asylum cells and prison execution chambers the locales for the ever searching reality of the situation. The film will mostly, for its first third at least, consist of men at the supposed peak of their respective careers telling the female lead just how wrong she is; how deluded she is and how correct they are. But she doesn't buckle; she knows what's what and she knows more than they do – she should, since she's smart, independent and she's the mother.Changeling only gives us a brief glimpse of peace, tranquillity and normality very early on. The very little exposure the film gives us of Michael works in the film's favour, since there isn't really enough of a stone-wall chance to map onto exactly what this child looks like, including any distinguishable features. From here, the film rather cannily relies on the supposed bringing back of a boy, of some description, which Christine is told is her son, to act as the overall initial incident. If the boy is indeed her son, the film is a study of madness; if he is the incorrect boy, then we observe the film has a licence to go down a different path, that of a detective story so that the truth can be searched out. What actually transpires is that Eastwood takes us down both routes anyway. We go off on one for the scenes in which Christine is supposedly crazy while the film unfolds a would-be hard-boiled; whisky downing; bribe-rejecting; noir-infused detective on the other – one that looks as if he's waltzed straight out of another film and into this one.As a physical representation of justice, this detective named Lester Ybarra (Kelly) is Eastwood's way of reminding us that not all men enjoy pushing women that have garnered praise and attention for defying what's expected of them back down into the doldrums. In regards to Christine's supposed madness, Eastwood shoots the scenes of her commitment in a particularly harrowing fashion. Additionally, Detective Ybarra's investigations lead him to an isolated shack int he middle of rural nowhere and the first things he notices upon entering the property are a cleaver and a knife on a table. Eastwood changes tact here, shooting the film like a horror piece. The slow burning sensation that turns the idea of loosing a son, and getting the wrong one in return, is developed from a misunderstanding that just needs to be sorted out to a real-time nightmare which suddenly comes complete with isolated shacks housing knifes and so forth.Changeling is a scary film. Its premise to do with missing children and the 'replacements' that are incorrect is harrowing. But the film's inclusion of a certain male hatred of certain strong willed women that comes complete with a specific space in which those are rounded up and placed within is equally as frightening, only on an entirely different level. Eastwood directs this visually impressive period piece brilliantly, with a real taste and acknowledgement towards his subject matter; while Angelina Jolie shines through in what might be her best film to date. Changeling is most certainly worth the time.",8,3,5,18 July 2009
Come and See," This film packs just about everything into an Eastern front war film but uses older techniques to put across the disturbance.
","Although seemingly a war film, Come and See really presents itself as a drama of sorts centring around one person and their horrific journey through a wartime period. The fact that this protagonist is, indeed, a 'fish out of water' adds to this theory. He doesn't seem to have a particular set mission and once the film gets to its hour and three quarter mark, the only mission aim I could see was: just damn-well survive!Very rarely do we get to see films about the Second World War, set on the Eastern front and made by the Eastern Europeans themselves. When we do, it would seem; we are royally treated. Back in the 1920s, something known as 'Soviet Montage' was the Soviets finding their film form. This is put across most notably in 'Strike!' and 'Battleship Potemkin'. In Come and See, despite being made in the 1980s, there are numerous Soviet Montage references that proves at least to me that director Elem Klimov knows his stuff. A series of disturbing images is put across to us without much in the way of dialogue but also relying heavily on music of the classical variety  this is Soviet montage and this is what happens during the truly memorable moments in Come and See. The film begins on a light-hearted note of two children 'playing' wars on a battlefield that has recently been fought for but this is only the hint at what's to come  one of these children is going to wish it had stayed a game. Then, he his taken from his home and tossed into the Eastern front. This event setting up a fascinating twenty-five or so minute sequence set around a woodland base where he meets other soldiers, gets his picture taken and indulges in some good old fashioned propaganda  he also accidentally yet seemingly randomly steps on a nest full of eggs when out on patrol; I feel this is an indication to the death and the crushing of the innocents to come.The film cleverly moves from one thing to another be it bedded down in a woodland base camp, taking cover in a field during a gun fight between two sides he is, quite literally, stuck in the middle of or perhaps the most famous: stumbling across a small town that the Nazis have targeting for utter eradication. It's no secret that the Germans destroyed villages by killing the inhabitants, destroying the buildings and then burying absolutely everything to cover up evidence and what happens in Come and See is as close to that as I have ever seen in any other film  maybe no other film with a better example even exists. With regards to the Soviet Montage references, when Come and See was made; Russia as we know it now was still the Soviet Union and its depiction of events is not only shocking and disturbing but also loud and forced upon you  such is war to a young man without too much life experience. From the fact an actual skeleton is dressed up to look like Adolf Hitler; just so it can be blown up again, seeing burnt out corpses lying there to music of some kind to the overuse of faces and peoples reactions in close up and, more importantly, montage format is enough evidence to suggest this is not only a modern, mind numbing war film but also a throwback to the old days of Soviet film-making. What also works is the constant use of horrible, horrible sound. The loud, disturbing noise the aeroplane makes when it hovers overhead constantly reminds us and the lead character of the first time it happened when bombs were dropped relatively close by; thus rendering him (and us) temporarily deaf. It is a nasty reminder of the psychological effects of war. The way the town is dealt with through suspense and screams is particularly horrible as is the way the Nazis merely leave alá the Vikings did centuries ago. They came, they burnt, they pillaged and then they left  torches aloft just like the Germans in Come and See.Come and See is not for the feint hearted nor is it for people who aren't heavily into film. At over two hours long, it's difficult to sit through and concentrate on fully all the time but not only this, it presents some of the most disturbing scenes in the eeriest of ways I've ever seen in a war film. Truly memorable film-making.",8,7,9,5 June 2007
The New World," Malick brings his own ingenuity to a story we all know but it cannot save the film from being what it is.
","A lot can be said for The New World, Terrence Malick's take on the true story of British settlers at Jamestown and the consequential love between two people of warring sides, those people being John Smith and Pocahontas. I think the story works or at least people take to it because it reminds us of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, itself a fable about two people interacting under the radar of two opposing sides. Granted, the British settlers and the Native Americans are not obviously hostile from the beginning but by the time the fight scenes have arrived, it's enough of a wait for the two to have spent time with one another and fallen in love. In this sense The New World works because Smith is allowed to spend time within the boundaries of the 'enemy', something both Romeo and Juliet could never do with the Montagues and the Capulets hating each other from the off.I think the trouble with The New World as an overall film is the clash of priorities it most definitely has. The film is artistic and creative in its shot choice and more often than not puts you in a status of dreamlike consciousness; it does this through its frequent use of cutaways to foliage and other such natural pieces of iconography like rivers, flowing water and trees swaying in the breeze; all of these shots are usually accompanied with dizzying music and rendered quite obvious in the film's demand for an artistic labelling.But this is half of the clash. The New World is essentially a genre picture, with the romance of Smith (Farrell) and Pocahontas (Kilcher) placing the film into that specific type. Later on, Pocahontas will strike up a relationship of some description with another John, this time it's Rolfe, played by Christian Bale. Bale's casting, by the time the film was made, meant the film was almost guaranteed to appeal to the teenage girl audience. Indeed, Farrell's inclusion ensured they would keep watching up to the first half and Bale's inclusion meant they'd keep going. Although the fact of the matter is that these two roles could well have been played by mostly any body since they demand the actor stand around, act neutral for most of the time and deliver whatever short bursts of dialogue when required.People say of Terrance Malick that he fits the auteur labelling; The New World is good ammunition for that argument. Most of us are familiar with the tale of the British settlers landing in America and encountering the Native Americans thanks largely through Disney's 1995 animated effort, itself rather underrated I thought, and it's because of this film I am familiar with said fable. But Malick takes this old, old story that has an essence of Romeo and Juliet within it and stamps it with his own creative, artistic touch. The cutaways to the rural backdrops of trees and water are included but they feel as if they are better things lurking below the surface, every so often having a peek over top, trying to get out. The good use of the jungle locations may remind us of Aguirre: The Wrath of God and the sparse use of dialogue feels at home given the approach to the material.So although there isn't anything wrong with the direction, The New World feels like the wrong film from the right director. It's really just a take on an event the mainstream will probably have heard of from a man the mainstream probably won't have heard of. The inclusion of Farrell, Bale and a good cast in general will attract those cast hungry people; predominantly teenagers and the artistic approach the film carries will make them go away thinking they've just seen something really smart. I didn't take to it as much as I thought I would. The fact John Smith is played by an Irishman is a little distracting, following on from the casting of Australian born Mel Gibson who came complete with an American accent of course, who played Smith in Disney's 1995 version. It seems the Americans, bless them, cannot bring themselves to cast an Englishman or indeed a Brit. for the role of John Smith.Then there are the other things like having Q'orianka Kilcher dressed up really fancy-like for the role of Pocahontas. As a character, she seems to be the only Native American female between the ages of 16-25 located on the entire continent. The fact that when she swaggers around she looks like a budding lap dancer, exchanging glances with Farrell in a dialogue sparse film remember, is distracting enough but the modern makeup and eerie sense she is supposed to be the object of the audience's gaze just feels out of place and somewhat disturbing. Pocahontas is young, attractive and doesn't say an awful lot thanks largely to the language barrier that exists between her and Smith. It's this level of anonymity that exists within her character on screen that will garner most attention from the teenage female audience as they associate themselves with her and watch (themselves) fall in love with Farrell all over again. I watch most films for their direction and the approach Malick brings to this fable is enough to warrant The New World a watch but all the other stuff going on between characters is slow and weak when it isn't plain uninteresting in the first place, how frustrating.",6,0,1,20 October 2008
Scarface," Live the American Dream With Tony Montana
","Scarface has to be one of the best and one of the most well known 'mob' films you can find. Its 1980's feel and look, De Palma's directing and of course Pacino's wonderfully diverse accent twinned with his ruthless efficiency as both an actor and a character make it something special. The glossy Miami setting proves a wonderful backdrop for the protagonist's quest to achieve in life, and achieve he does. Although spoofed on a number of different occasions, nothing really gets taken away from this film as it, in a way, 'got there first'. It contains all the original, necessary atmosphere and 'mise-en-scene' required to really grab the viewer and suck them in with its slick and often loud character attire, exotic setting and eerie lighting in some scenes, announcing the violence to come before we even suspect anything.Apart from the rather erratic captions early on in the film, there is little you can find fault-wise in this film. If you like the genre and the sense of the narrative i.e.; it is rather lending itself towards dialogue more than action in a 60-40 balance and will have all the necessary scenes to draw out the 'climbing the ladder' scenario, then this film is definitely for you. The interesting accents and one-on-one conversations the central character has during the film with numerous friends and foe's alike adds to the sense of time being passed and rungs being climbed - it works very well.The mind spinning soundtrack full of 80's music is something you can't really decide whether to love or loath but thanks to a certain computer game from a few years ago, they seem to have regained a bit of respect amongst fans and it is certainly a breath of fresh air in the sense it's different when comparing it to standard music as a convention found in other mobster movies such as classical Italian themes in 'The Godfather Trilogy' and 1950's tracks being pumped out to mobsters in black suits when thinking of 'Goodfellas'.What also sells this film is the element of narrative once the character feels he's reached a certain stage in his goal. When he feels he's hit the top, the journey through Pacino's characters mind is equally as fascinating as the one we had when seeing him attempt to get there in the first place. The paranoia and obsession with security early on in his 'reign' is a hint of things to come and the bloody climax builds up through Pacino's good acting and a turn of events which helps us really begin to recognise with what a danger he has become through corruption of power.Despite its basic 'American Dream' plot, Scarface deals with it in some style and punch which is perhaps lacking in other films in the genre. Its nice iconography, mise-en-scene and decent acting from the cast puts it in a healthy position near the top of all time greats of the genre and possibly of all time.",9,0,2,14 February 2006
Frost_Nixon," Astute direction from Howard and two booming central performances elevate televisual material onto a new realm.
","It's to Frost/Nixon's great credit that a series, or passage, of televised interviews from thirty or so years ago come across as cinematic as they do here. In a film whose requirements are to distribute a certain amount of dramatic weight to both the interviews themselves as well as to all the talking, planning and building in the lead up to the interviews, Frost/Nixon rather impressively balances the burden. Most of the scenes in the run up carry a strange, laid back and somewhat cheeky aura to them; driven by Michael Sheen's gleefully faced, easily excitable, 'the world is my oyster' journalist David Frost. There's nothing that the man doesn't think he cannot achieve; and the period setting, in which a lot of the mise-en-scene seems to boast somewhat proudly 'this is the 1970s', mixed with a colourful palette creates an odd overall juxtaposition clashing with the fact it's Richard Nixon we're additionally dealing with here; and it's what he did that spawns what the film's essentially revolving around.I'd say a lot of the film feels carefree, almost as if we're supposed to find a lot of what goes on quite funny, but I mean that with the greatest of respects. Out of the interview room, the universe in which the film is unfolded is Frost's and is captured dutifully by the above characteristics. When the cameras are rolling and the two men are sitting opposite one another, Frost initially seems lost: that sense of 'fun' dissipates and Nixon dominates a lot of the proceedings. The film is a clashing of two perspectives of the world and those that inhabit it: young with old; carefree with careful; colloquial with formal but in addition, that underlying essence of British with American.The film begins with what looks like some sort of formal interview about tricky subject matter shot with a 'vox-pox' ideation in mind, very quickly setting up that sense of juxtaposition Frost/Nixon seems to maintain in regards to character attitudes and sense of atmosphere. Frequently using, but not overdoing, the docu-drama convention; the early dialogue to camera is a journalist talking about how he followed Nixon's gradual decline from The White House as president of the USA, before observing the finale to everything and how to him it all resembled a soap opera of sorts, as these incredible events played out to the world. The relation that the film makes here, towards how real life events are able to carry some sort of dramatic weight, is a further example of how Frost/Nixon's self-referential style and content believes in its subject material and invites you to dramatically enjoy it. This is both the talk and the build up to the interviews as well as the actual Frost-Nixon interviews themselves as a piece of cinematic drama.Sheen is Frost, as mentioned, whilst Frank Langella is Nixon. Nixon is a big guy, both in name and stature. Frost is softly spoken in comparison, juddery and wide-eyed whereas Nixon's deep, gruff and somewhat slurred voice twinned with a supposed bottomless pit of knowledge, interests and life-stories has him as more than a match for this relatively small time London Weekend Television based TV presenter whose overall televisual genre, if we go by what Frost is seen presenting early on, seems to be a combination of both news and slapstick.Most of the film is fun and games in regards to the build up to the first interview. Nixon establishes himself as the kind of man who subscribes to challenges, likes to set himself goals and enjoys battles with individuals, be they victories or otherwise. When Kevin Bacon's Jack Brennan, an aide to Nixon, begins to label it a boxing match – a sort of on screen verbal jousting, the notion of this being a close to one-off; one-on-one scenario between two contrasting individuals is really pushed home in case nobody's got it by now. The film's somewhat colourful and upbeat content prior to the sessions, helped by Frost's seemingly invincible confidence, establishes one sense of aura but everything gradually gets lowered down to a more grounded level when it's established money is an issue on Frost's behalf, something that will crop up later in in regards to loosing a lot of it as well as potentially one's career. There's that feeling that Frost, playing an up and coming television personality, whilst Nixon, as an on the way down politician, has a chance to bury him when they meet half way.But Ron Howard's impressive direction puts pay to this, very gradually reiterating the money as an element which puts everything severely at stake. The reality of the situation is brought home when Frost is all alone in a darkened and gloomy hotel room on a Friday night prior to a days shooting – he doesn't have much to go on in terms of material, and his career is on the line: there's that interesting sense that the guy is beginning to realise what 'real' journalism is all about. But while encompassing elements of self-discovery for Frost, establishing a wrong belief and a wrong approach before having him correct himself, the film isn't necessarily dominated by this study. Rather, it sees a man grossly underestimate another man, much in the vein he did an entire nation with a very fair and very specific political system rendering the whole thing a success on careful and minute levels.",7,1,2,6 December 2009
Walk the Line," An entertaining yet often formulaic biopic.
","Although musicals are not my speciality, 'Walk the Line' had a certain allure to it that made me want to witness the rise of one of the worlds most all-time well known musicians through the medium of film. What was odd that it turned out the film didn't really play like a musical and managed to end up like a romance/fairytale story. But this wasn't a bad thing.I really liked the use of diegetic sound in the film. That means the sounds and, more importantly; the music, were actually in the film resulting in the fact we could hear them just as well as the characters could and this played an important part in witnessing Johnny Cash's journey. The music on the radio which plays a big part later on, (or more importantly, the person singing it), the rough sound of the bands making their own records in a store followed by the shutting of a door in Cash's face giving off a sense that he can hear his music on the record but it's just a little out of reach and hard to get to and the way he rehearses his songs whilst in the army are all good, early examples of Cash and his tendency to give music and sound a priority in life.What also adds to this is the early changes of era. We go through a couple of decades in about five year bursts and each time, the setting and the music changes somewhat. This gives a good feeling of travel and suggests Cash's character is on quite a journey.Along with the music, the other thing I mentioned was the romance element. Because this is a life story, a marriage or a relationship is bound to come along at some point and the film deals with these relationships (in fact, with most character's relationships with each other) in an entertaining way. Each relation is pushed to an absolute limit. Cash's constant lust to get married to June and the way he shows her up a few times is pretty awkward viewing and if you don't know how the story ends, it's fascinating watching them all react in the slow, awkward way in which they do. What's also good is that well into the marriage, there are certain cliff-hangers we are left on, leaving doubt as to whether each character will love one another anymore.It's also interesting how the actual musical performances advance the plot. The relationships growing on screen and Cash's problems are two of the things highlighted during these scenes and they work well.Although these good things inject the film after every twenty minutes or so, they're not enough to stop some glaring items that bring the film down. These occur every now and again but the most obvious is when our hero, Johnny, settles down with married life which is, coincidentally, when the film looses a lot of energy as it stops for a breather. There's also a bit of an obvious 'protagonist's failure' when he seems to be loosing his battle with his drink and drug problem. It seemed like a bit of an obvious 'lowest point' before he miraculously came back for his last performances, especially at the jail.Although sometimes frustrating and if you can look past the fact Reece Witherspoon's character doesn't seem to age in the film, there's a good chance you'll like this interesting and sometimes entertaining biopic.",7,0,1,10 November 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Still pretty funny and as long as all copies of films like Beerfest exist, still relevant.
","I like the Borat film, I like it a lot. In some regards, it is anti-thesis to all those crass, American produced 'comedies' that usually, often predominantly, rely on limp portrayals of Europeans as a source of humour. This might come in the form of the endless disregarding of people from many-a nation in 2006's Beerfest; to the loose, sexy Eastern European girls in the American Pie films and even onto the weak, intermittent representations of Europeans in EuroTrip – which may have had a lot of good stuff going on around all the sloppy other content, but that doesn't excuse what it presents us at the worst of times. Borat is the film that presents a similarly shocking Eastern-European-come-Western-Asian stereotype in Borat Sagdiyev (Baron Cohen) and exploits what little knowledge genuine Americans really have about the places, indeed the continent, that they lampoon so often.I suppose it is a fighting fire with fire, a using of a stereotype or a negative representation in order to actually uncover the larger levels of tunnel vision some American's have on the world around them. But rather than just produce an out-and-out film in which American characters are presented in a typically naive or even stupid manner; the makers here have used real people, saying unscripted things, to act as characters instead and it is infinitely more funny than any low-brow, crass and desperate visual joke-come-representation as seen in the said films.Borat and his film-making partner Azamat Bagatov (Davitian) travel through America, specifically to California from New York after Borat realises someone called Pamela Anderson exists, getting into mis-adventures, scraps, scrapes and undergoing a brilliant mock-journey of self discovery. Borat is the ultimate fish-out-of-water, and yet he dominates his respective locations when interviewing and speaking to other Americans. If the Kazakhs find offence in Borat, than it would have initially been born out of Borat's naivety to his surroundings in mistaking an elevator for a hotel room and a toilet for a wash basin. The specific size of a room and purpose of everyday-for-us appliances act as reasons to chuckle at Kazakhs. There is also an opening ten or so minute segment in which Borat's supposed home-land is put across as less-than desirable.But from a certain point on in, the laughs snowball at the expense of Americans: a desperate car-salesman really wanting to unload an automobile on a seemingly unsuspecting foreigner; a gun shop salesman trying to offload a gun by exclaiming it's especially good for killing Jews; a rodeo gathering that express grossly mis-judged statements on the world and those around them whilst quite clearly in the presence of rolling cameras and an R.V. full of kids, the very audience the films mentioned in the first paragraph are aimed at, equally displaying a shocking disregard to most things around them.While the things and statements most of Borat's victims come up with are deeply offensive, it is the very notion someone would be willing to utter these things on camera to complete strangers that is the most distressing thing. If we laugh, we laugh at the audacity more than the statements; if we laugh at the feminists, who themselves might well be victims of discrimination or prejudice in the past, we laugh at their reactions that someone would be so-bold as to say the things Borat says to them; things that I would not assume, in any way, reflect personal feelings on the author's behalf.The important thing is that the author's are additionally able to laugh at themselves when, in a particular interview with a coloured politician who is introduced rather unnervingly via voice-over, uncovers a homosexual encounter Borat recently and unwittingly engaged in. Interestingly, the few locations Baron Cohen is unable to force reactions are in the form of a motel run by an elderly Jewish couple that quickly turns into a bit of a horror parody as they dare eat the offerings given to them by the couple, as well as an extremely tolerant group of individuals in the Deep South that Borat has dinner with. He manages to insult the host's wife and mistake a 'retiree' for a 'retard' before finally facing the fact he must flee on account the authorities are called. As very raw and very real moments of situation comedy, they work an absolute treat.The film's final third revolves around a would-be romance with a certain Pamela Anderson, someone Borat is so dense that he initially assumes her Baywatch character to be someone of real life flesh and blood. When Borat does hit the skids and the chips are down, the film reels off into a mock sense of 'where one belongs' and that friendship is actually a really important thing and, despite being in the most powerful nation in the world, it's important to remember where one's roots lie getting across a sense it's easy to be seduced by surroundings and short-term goals when you have so much riding for you, initially. The pastiche is a wonderful send up of other recent comedies' final acts, After School Special and Superbad in particular, in which the characters realise their goal is elusive and that they must respect what they have.Borat is a much better film than Ali G Indahouse, a film that takes rude, crude and low-brow material and turns it around so that those making an absolute packet out of it can be sent up. With the imminent release of Brüno, Baron Cohen is gaining in confidence and taking his characters out of more Western Euopean nations before unleashing them at Americans. The very effeminate personality of the character twinned with that very distinct but very deliberate German accent could spell trouble for some, cracking entertainment for others.",7,0,0,23 June 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 'That would not be funny in America, OK?'
","Much water has passed under the bridge since 'Borat' was released: America elected its first black president, before going on to reject his would-be heir in 2016 for somebody else...; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have somewhat thawed, with fighting giving way to elections, international cricket teams and would-be Islamic States. The economic situation tanked, social media exploded and the lines between men and women were greyed. Sacha Baron Cohen himself moved on to other characters in other productions - one of which, 2018's 'Who is America?', even had its title double up as it hypothesis.Interestingly, during the closing montage of 'Borat', the titular character himself even asks, having undergone a coast-to-coast trek across the United States, the similar question 'What did I learn?' Well, what DID we learn about America at the time of the film's shooting in the summer of 2005? Viewing it now, and forgetting one or two of the set ups and comedic beats, it is still at least a very funny film: Borat's haggling over the price of a hotel room; his belief that all people in the city of Atlanta speak like those on the poverty line; his interview with a group of feminists; the way the film plays with the long-since established musical cues of 'Easy Rider' to reveal a very different method of transportation to that of a Harley-Davidson - each of these make me smile just listing them here. Baron Cohen plays the eponymous Borat Sagdiyev, whose very beginnings as a character made-flesh, I seem to recall from a documentary on the actor, actually began in the late-1990's as a Moldovan migrant who would walk around London asking people whether they were Cockneys. A few years later, he was the rounded character we all know now playing undercard to Ali G on British television before then making his first foray into America in 2004 with 'Ali G in da USAiii'. Sagdiyev is a television journalist living in a backwards Kazakh village seemingly characterised by incest; child soldiers; anti-Semitism and technological retardation. The village is a microcosm of the nation itself, so the government have Sagdiyev and his obese producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) traverse to the world-famous New York City to learn about culture and so-forth to try and boost the country's standing - hence the subtitle 'Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'. The results are to be shot on film and, it seems, conveyed in this very piece... What follows is, broadly speaking, a series of incidences consisting of Baron Cohen involving his character with a number of real-life people in a set of curious set-pieces which, I THINK, is trying to get to the bottom of what kind of place America is. To describe the film as a documentary; neo-realist or a piece of Dogme '95 cinema would be misleading, but it borrows heavily from each. Initially, the film takes a noticeably minimalist approach to answering its hypothesis: it depicts Borat, quite literally, greeting people on the train having just landed; unpacking his things in what he thinks is his hotel room in front of a bellboy and then walking around Times Square interacting with passers-by on his first full day.By chance, a conversation with a panel of feminists ('listen pussycat, smile a bit...') the night after accidentally happening upon a 'Baywatch' episode on TV forces him onto the road and to the opposite end of the country to seek out actress Pamela Anderson for marriage. The manner about which the film incorporates Sagdiyev's innocent enquiry into the feminism conversation is both fascinating and hilarious: Who was the blonde on the television last night? Where does she live? Noting down Anderson's locality, one feminist quips 'Oh, he's gonna look her up(!)' Was any of this planned? Did the producers merely have Borat watch TV with the intension of filming Baron-Cohen's reaction, before pushing him off in that direction anyway?Many of Borat's interactions with an America his trek across to Los Angeles takes him through are cleverly woven into the film in this respect: initially, they refuse to fly and so must drive, and this leads Borat to, firstly, a driving instructor and then a used-car salesman. Later, an interaction with some Jews, Borat's mortal enemy, leads him to a gun store for protection and a terrifying conversation with the staff. In Washington DC, a gay pride rally suddenly becomes part of proceedings. Once on the road, and as the money dwindles and his friendship with Azamat is strained, the adventure turns into a bit of a nightmare...But what did anybody really 'learn'? Writing in Slate Magazine, Christopher Hitchens seemed to think the film, inadvertently or otherwise, more broadly exposed the tremendous tolerance America has of outsiders and how calm and understanding many often are in dealing with outsiders. For this, it was a success. Others lamented as to how it was too keen to attack conservative targets, while a more general gripe seemed to be as to how the film was little more, when all is said and done, but a few candid-camera skits.Seeing it now, we learn America is a diverse nation split by class and culture: at a rodeo, it is a place of bigotry; in many of its hotels and mansions, it is a place of affluence; in Atlanta, of poverty and potential hostility; at a Jewish run B&B, of immense kindness and whilst on the road with a crew of frat boys, of disturbing sexism. I think ultimately, the film tries to make a correlation between some of America and the village at the beginning - we chuckle at those supposedly living in the stone-age, but the joke is on us when the next 70 minutes reminds us of how some of this stuff is already in the West.",7,0,1,26 September 2018
Alien 3," Alien 'cubed'? The project never really gets out of the box...
","You can practically see the board of whomsoever meeting around a table, their faces contorted as they strain to come up with an idea on why a second 'Alien' sequel would happen at all; what it's premise might be; how it might be the case that one of these monsters might have found its way into proceedings given the first sequel, 1986's 'Aliens', concluded as it did. In the end, the best they can settle for is a brief rewriting of history: something, inexplicably, manages to crawl its way into the escape vessel, and here we all go again.I was always aware there were issues over the production of 'Alien3', the classic case of the studio facing off against the director in a fashion more akin to the medium of television; that immortal battle, not of aliens versus predator, but of business versus art; of a studio not having any interest in auteuristic integrity but delivering bang-for-buck. I have never quite found the motivation to look up as to the precise details of the rift with which 'Alien3' was fraught, but I suppose there are bits and pieces of its evidence in the film when you watch it now: its early eagerness to go down the route of a mood piece, the way it eventually bottles that for second unit material, the finale itself, which must have induced a battle of words off-camera not dissimilar to how someone representative of a large organisation tries to talk somebody out of what they're contemplating...But all that comes later. We pick up where the last film left off: Ripley (Weaver), firmly established as the franchise's lead, drifts aimlessly through space with a young girl; an android and a hardened solider, the only four survivors of an expedition which saw a crew of marines frequent an alien infested space community years prior. She crash lands on a planet which basks in a violent storm, where greys and cold blues dominate the colour palette and ugliness the skyline. It is home to that of a prison, which seems as if it is supposed to sport the worst kind of inmates imaginably, but are here in an odd transitional phase; they have found God, rapists are undergoing vows of celibacy; serial killers are more interested in delivering sermons than blunt objects into people.When Ripley awakes, the wardens who run the facility can only take her story with a pinch of salt, but why else would a soldier; an infant; a droid and a technician be banded together in an escape pod? She has, in fact, lost the three survivors from the last film, who did not survive the crash-landing, which is a shame, because the film had two or three fairly interesting characters with whom we had spent enough time to get to know. Not to use them here was a pity, although did demonstrate a gutsy decision on the director's behalf to want to create his own idea, his own universe.We sample what this might have been like via Lance Henriksen's Bishop character, who is briefly brought back via the miracle of technology. She can only find solace thus in the character of Clemens, a medical officer played by Charles Dance with some conviction; someone with an unfortunate past and who walks around with a lot of weight on his shoulders - suddenly, we don't mind at all if the entire piece revolves around the two of them.The film does well with its gamesmanship once the alien does show up and people are found a little worse for wear; we are, after all, on a planet populated by psychopathic criminals and there is a good deal of worth in the exchanges as per who is telling the truth and what exactly is going on. It is only a shame these exchanges do not go on for a little longer. Eventually, the film will switch to its horror setting, and things bed down into a more familiarised groove.The dynamic here as per 'Aliens' is that, while these criminals are about as tough as the marines, they are the inverse in that they have previously used their violent energy for amoral purposes. It felt as if there might have been some interesting ground to cover as per exploring morality and redemption, forcing the audience into getting behind an unpleasant character-or-two, but it just isn't present. Those the film considers suitable to propel it into its final act are reforming themselves anyway, so why bother?The inmates are, additionally, not armed with the latest in military hardware, but they feel suspiciously less vulnerable than the armed marines. This is because, firstly, the film isn't made as competently and secondly because we don't really know any of them in the first place. The film is therefore not as tense as it should have been. What is also markedly different here is that there is no insider or traitor to the cause like in 'Alien' and 'Aliens', so there is no dramatic revelation as the film reaches its crescendo as before. Said crescendo is a messy finale, more synthetic than the previous two and down in a maze of corridors whose geography I lost track of.Standing back and taking stock of 'Alien3', you can see the skeletons of two or so different films - it is almost as if it didn't even need an alien in order to work, and that the presence of such a thing bogs it down. Reimagine it as a film merely relaying a chapter in Ripley's life, with or without Dance's character; stuck on a prison planet where all of the inmates are unpleasant; where Hicks and Newt are alive and walking around and where the 'Organisation' still wants witness to its prize. What we get instead is an experience that is probably despised more than it deserves to be, but still falls well short of its bigger sisters.",6,1,1,8 October 2019
Alien 3," Better than people give it credit for even if it strays a little too much toward the original.
","I suppose with the benefit of hindsight, I can see exactly what director David Fincher was trying here. We all know him for his Se7en's, Fight Club's and his Zodiac's but this really does work as an early piece of bleak cinematography and eerie suspense from the man. There is a lot of hate for Alien³, partly because it resembles the first Alien so much and probably partly also because it does not resemble the second Alien film enough. But to dislike it due to its lack of covering new ground is more of a compliment to Alien and its original, brilliant approach than it is a criticism of Alien³ because whilst this isn't better than '1', it is better than '2'.I did not enjoy Cameron's fast, action packed shoot 'em up attempt at an Alien film the first time I saw it and with subsequent viewings, it slips even further down the ladder of quality. There was just no heart and no attempt at trying to scare us  it was merely a bunch of uninteresting, annoying marines shooting monsters. But Alien³ tones things down; it calms the viewer and allows us dialogue to listen to; situations to arrive and be dealt with whilst allowing certain characters to die either tragically or unexpectedly. In Aliens, there would be a gunfight; a death and some silly one-liners afterwards  this would be repeated for the film's duration. Alien³ does not allow us dumb action rightly so until the film's finale and even then, the action is not dumbed down; it is a sequence where the prisoners must use their logic in trapping the beast so that they may succeed  the idea to ban all guns from the film is a bold and brilliant one and one that is said so early on in the office as a sort of way that allows Fincher to announce his ideas: 'this will not be like the previous film: there are no guns on this particular planet.' But then again, Fincher cannot direct action too well anyway. His subsequent films include little to no action but they get across a feeling that you have just seen something rather stunning anyway. The finale in Se7en is not an action set piece but a twist that makes you feel you've just seen something incredible; the twist in Fight Club hits you in a way that again forces you to come to terms with the revelation whilst making you feel you've just seen an amazing action set piece. But Alien³ is a Fincher film that has a few death scenes sprinkled in it throughout without ever feeling like it will suffice as guilty entertainment - Fincher knows suspense and gets the balance right. There are some scenes early on involving a suspicion Ripley (Weaver) has; the subsequent autopsy and nearer the end when nobody knows where the Alien is in the tunnels. To me, these scenes suffice and act as more entertaining and more interesting viewing than out and out gunfire action.With this in mind, whenever death scenes do occur they do so in a sudden and disorientating manner which is a neat idea for a film to do but when it is handled by someone like Fincher who is more of a suspense director, it can fall flat. Consequently, a scene in which a couple of explosions go off for some reasons and people go flying all over the place, it seems a little heavy handled and sloppy, but it only ever happens once until the finale which like I said is more logic and camera than one-liners and gunfire. Directors such as Spielberg in Jaws, Saving Private Ryan and Munich as well as Scott in the first Alien can get the balance right between suspense and action and here, Fincher gives it a good go.There is also that reoccurring idea to do with gender and sexuality. Ripley and the last few members of the crew from Aliens have crashed onto a planet inhabited by male prisoners. There is a scene which challenges what these prisoners want, sexually, with how much they want it. The lead warden (rather foolishly?) announces a woman is in the establishment but the woman is Ripley who of course embodies very masculine traits; this is further emphasised when she shaves her head, shedding any femininity that remains  this challenges the male prisoners, some of whom have been established as rapists: do they still want the woman if the woman is not 'like' a woman? These ideas also pay reference to the character of Vasquez in the previous Alien film.There may be the notion that Alien³ is very much like Alien what with its idea behind there only being one beast to contend with and a crew in an confined space without any weapons. There is also a hard bodied, strongly willed black character who is clearly (in a positive ethnic representation) the only one who wants to fight, echoing the character of Parker in Alien. But the film is not bad; the sets and cinematography are good and whilst the deaths, action and the surprising amount of British prisoners is iffy, Clemens' relationship with Ripley acts as a sweet distraction and the film does its job overall. The only thing that had me truly puzzled was why we saw the world from the Alien's POV in this film  I do not recall that having been done previously and cannot work out the theory (if any) behind this.",6,4,47,20 March 2008
Mission: Impossible III," The film the Mission: Impossible franchise desperately needed.
","Mission: Impossible III plunges you head first into both chaos, anxiety, fear and general hatred towards the bad-guys as well as sympathy and remorse towards the good. The very first scene of the film sees Tom Cruise in a helpless and rather desperate situation as a psychotic arms dealer named Davian (Seymour Hoffman) holds a gun to our man Ethan Hunt's wife's head spouting some nonsense about a rabbit's foot. The scenario is futile with only one, tragic outcome seemingly going to occur. Systematically and within the opening few minutes of the film, new franchise director J.J. Abrams injects something that had been lacking throughout Mission: Impossible II's entirety: feeling and the general aura of threat, or something at stake.Gone are the days, thank God, when a long haired Tom Cruise smirked nonchalantly as he pottered about on screen emitting all the necessary characteristics that made you want to throttle him. Gone are the days when Cruise, having just come off an ego-led high following an Oscar nomination for Magnoila, catered to John Woo, who just blew lots of stuff up, had everyone wear masks and at once point came close to having his characters physically fly following a motorcycle chase. The fluffy, two-bit and wholesome bore that was the second 'MI' film has gone and has been replaced by 'sit there and struggle whilst bound to a chair as I threaten to execute your wife'. It's quite a jump, yes, but a welcome one.Up front, this Mission: Impossible is probably the best of the three but that isn't too much of a commendation. The film has its action, true, but it doesn't allow the action to overtake the narrative and what's at stake. You can argue, rightfully so, that the action set pieces in this are better to that of the first but that is principally down to the fact J.J. Abrams can direct action of this magnitude better than Brian De Palma can; that's no disservice to De Palma, a wonderful director and far more accomplished, but this is territory that Abrams just slots into. If De Palma directs action as an eerie and suspenseful sequence of motions (station shootout in Carlito's Way as well as the pool hall scene plus the drug deal prior to the 'chainsaw' scene in Scarface), then Abrams directs action as a spectacle: the jet, the helicopter, the guy being thrown off his feet into a window, the machine gun fire, etc. When I recall De Palma's 'MI', I recall the coming down through the ceiling and the opening ten minutes as memorable set pieces whereas the chopper in the tunnel at the end was a bit silly and an easy, explosive way to end a summer released espionage film.But Abrams does this well and maintains an interesting story that spaces the action set pieces fairly well. The first of these is a rescue mission in Berlin during which Hunt actually comes out of retirement from the force and rescues the needy via gun fights, escape and general mayhem. It is this that spawns a certain postcard that is delivered to Hunt and this in turn spawns the notion that baddie Owen Davian should be apprehended. This action set piece pays special attention to getting into the establishment, apprehending the target and then 'cloning' him in the way they do before trying to escape in the manner they do. What follows is a shoot out on a bridge and one or two other action scenes later on.These action scenes vary in form, from a rescue mission; to an apprehension to a dealing with an ambush and each feel nicely spaced as a consequence of the film's progressing rather than for showy reasons. The crux of the film is about terrorism; it's about arms dealing. Its villain is selling weapons and terrorism will be the result of their actions should the heroes fail. This is the first post 9/11 Mission: Impossible and the fear of further terrorism as a result of the heroes' (the West's?) incompetence is quite clearly up there on screen. It's an interesting array of ideas, backed up by a very True Lies inspired scenario revolving around Hunt being what he is and Hunt's wife, Julia (Monaghan), not knowing this. Like True Lies, it establishes this female character as this unspectacular and seemingly normal individual before ripping her out of the mould and forcing her to become a bit of a solider herself or a life saver; but that would be spoiling too much.If there are flaws, it's that towards the end, little individual stunts begin to tarnish the hard work laid down. Someone shoots out tyres from beneath a truck, whilst getting a phone signal and putting pressure on a gun wound mostly all at once and I think Abrams gets a little carried away with his action  maybe they hadn't spent so much of the budget, realised the film was closing and just put everything into a last hurrah for the climax. Still, the action is good and well spaced; we care for the characters and the narrative doesn't demand we be too dismissive of it. If there is a fourth, it needs to build on what Abrams has most certainly laid down right here.",6,0,1,13 March 2009
Lucky Number Slevin," Just above average
","With a good cast, a stylish looking trailer and with an interesting plot looking like it was in store, this film seemed like it was going to raise some eyebrows, unfortunately it didn't. The narrative is actually rather weak, despite the interesting twist at the end, it revolves around the case of mistaken identity for far too long early on to want to warrant multiple viewings; it was very frustrating to see the plot seem to just stick where it was. The editing added to this frustration as the quick cuts and sharp one-liners seemed to be, in a strange way, sarcastic to the viewer.The acting was sharp and spot on from the two crime bosses Freeman and Kingsley and Tucci's policeman character added to the menace the antagonists carry with them through out this film. Bruce Willis is, as usual, on top form this time as an emotionless and professional killer. One problem with this film is that it seems to want to be numerous other ones already made. Most noticeably, it has the witty sharpness twinned with a simple but effective crime element as seen in 'Snatch' and the technique of making one character looking like the victim the whole time before flipping it on its head just like in 'The Usual Suspects'. These aspects aren't badly done, they just seem 'familiar' and it's truly frustrating.I really tried to like this film as it falls into my favourite film genre but on the whole, it was just stumbling over its self at various points and doing the build up to the twisted climax no favours at all. The film is by no means bad but it is far from good with numerous flaws in the way it hangs about meaninglessly early on and draws out the whole thing in a slow manner. The one-liners get tiresome and it is relatively action starved on the whole. I'd recommend it, but only just. Go to see it for the dizzy array of stars on show and if you're feeling like seeing a crime film which will by no means leave you gasping for breath, but will leave you relatively well satisfied at the same time.",6,12,29,26 February 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Brash and up-front depiction of an array of people and their connecting with varying forms of drugs; an ambitious piece which works really well.
","One of the more terrifying things about Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is how numerous extras appear to just 'exist' amidst proceedings and merely get on with their own lives, fleetingly mentioning the odd happening from recent times, as they intermingle with the film's core characters whom are witnessing their own existences fall apart at their very seams. Watching these people going about their business on screen reminds us of the same way those figures, or people, in our nightmares mingle around in the background as we dream on; we're aware of them, much like the central characters are aware of them here, but we cannot really make them out nor indeed really work out what it is they're saying or plotting. Often, we feel at the mercy of them; we pray that they're not speaking or plotting against us. Such are the situations the numerous leads, in this rather eye-opening urban drama that does carry an hallucinogenic, nightmarish quality, eventually come to bury themselves in; a sad, sorrowful film depicting the gradual falling away from reality of a number of people because of drugs or drug addiction in varying forms as well as falsified dream chasing.What is most admirable about the film is the manner in which how, the now somewhat renowned American director, Darren Aronofsky manages to take an idea one might surmise with a one-sentence pitch and manages to spin a tale out of it all that's cinematic and with a distinct, applied aesthetic which engages without ever glorifying and never at once feels like a lecture. The film revolves around a handful of disparate New York-based characters, their tales running parallel in a multi stranded fashion with their coming into contact with drugs, or the drug trade in some form, making up the meat of film's core. It is, much like 1996's Trainspotting, a smart and cunning drama applying a post-modern spin to what might constitute as what the British used to refer to as 'kitchen sink drama' in its depiction of predominantly young, attractive people destroying their lives through the lust for a drug fix. In this sense, Aronofsky has made a 'whizz-bang' film guaranteed to keep those of a younger disposition in their adult lives occupied whilst tell a tale systematically demonising the activity within, and yet retaining enough intensity for it to appeal to those well beyond the dangers of slipping into drug addiction.Jared Leto plays Harry Goldfarb, a young Brooklyn based man with a penchant for class-A drugs, which his girlfriend Marion (Connelly) additionally shares, and constantly on the look for ways into the narcotics trade operating out of this shady corner of The Big Apple. Living not so far away from Harry is his elderly mother, Sara (Burstyn); a woman living in a decrepit apartment with a flurry of other elderly women, of whom spend most of their time sitting outside in the summer's heat on the pavement, and whose lone item in her flat that's worth any money at all is her television. The things in life to which she holds dear lie in the form of one of her son's school photos, depicting the kid at better and more affluent times, and that television through which she gradually observes herself becoming the newfound star of a kind of reality TV show following a phone call from the network inviting her in.The film dances between the two strands with the sort of consummate ease that would have you think it were were a piece composed by a filmmaker seemingly nearing the height of his game; Marlon Wayans' local lowlife Tyrone Love filtering into proceedings on account of being good friends with Harry and later heading his own story of grief when things reach a hilt. Aronofsky seeps a sense of repugnance through proceedings; a 'sickness in the stomach' feeling; an aesthetic feeding off what can only really be likened to that of the drug-induced, nauseating aesthetic certain American films from the turn of the 1970s, in the form of Easy Rider or Midnight Cowboy, carried with them. There is a gross repetition to some events that unfold which, rather than frustrate the audience, has feel the clammy, grotesque sensation rife throughout. Sara's gradual obsession with weight loss pills and the necessity to essentially look as thin, and therefore ill-mindedly beautiful, as possible dominates her story; the film, as it depicts her seemingly withering away to a desired size, rears the other way in its depiction of her surroundings by gradually bulking out her apartment into this medieval chamber of filth and mould – a locale in which she looses her mind; hallucinates inanimate objects coming alive and suffers premature proleptic shifts to stardom plus the conclusion of this celebrificated process she desires.Harry is a good looking boy with a good looking girlfriend; both of whom admit they love one another very much and we sense in an alternate world, they'd be able to settle down away form all this. Their brief, gentle early embrace is a hundred-times more erotic than the depths toward which young Marion will have to later plunge for her drug 'fix'. Then there is Tyrone's path formulating out of the events, a strand more akin to being a gangster film or drugs trade thriller which might have made a fascinating short all by itself. The film, in spite of being driven by a very simple message or core thesis, is constructed around the incorrect use of lens' deliberately done so to induce sickness; excruciatingly low camera angles and cinematography encompassing good uses of extreme close ups of objects that aren't nasty to look at, but evoke reactions of disgust anyway. The film is a hardened and substantial peek into the crevasses of drug addiction merging uneasily with mental illness; a peek that is studiously executed in what is a highly effective drama.",7,0,0,26 August 2011
Captain Phillips," Prepare to have your emotions boarded - Captain Phillips is certainly worth seeing.
","'Captain Phillips' works well as a dramatic piece rather than as any terrific character study or deep, involved piece of story-telling; it is a picture-perfect exercise in execution of suspense - nobody ever really feels safe and it is difficult, due to it being of no real fixed genre or possessive of a stone-wall story, to entirely tie down as to where it will all end up as you watch it unfold. As it roars towards its finale on the open seas of the Indian Ocean, all four of the feasible possibilities that I counted pertaining to who lives; who dies and what anybody gets away with are still open to happening.Paul Greengrass' film, based on the true events which befell poor Captain Richard Phillips of the container ship Maersk Alabama and his crew in 2009, may very well be entitled as such, and indeed sold as a film depicting the events which involved said man, but it is really about three captains: an ordinary captain of a container ship; a pirate captain and then later a Navy captain who commands a gunship. By the end, when Phillips has been forced onto the side-lines - relegated to a supporting act in his own supposed film - the battle has moved on from its beginnings and into the uncharted territories whereby the pirate goes up against the soldier who is himself forced into his own series of predicaments and moral cul-de-sacs pertaining to who potentially lives and who potentially dies.Tom Hanks is the eponymous Philips, an uncomplicated man whose life story to this point the film does not seem to think important. Aged around fifty, he and his wife live in an affluent neighbourhood in the wilderness of Vermont. They drive around, worrying about the world they live in, which is becoming a more desperate place to live and apparently changing too dramatically. Are they referring to the then-recent economic crash? The spread of terror in spite of a war on terror? We cannot tell. One thing they do admit to is a worry for their adult children, whose prospects in a swelling job market appear gloomy.Meanwhile, a million hypothetic miles away, a Somali terror cell rapidly concoct a gang of misfits to engage in some piracy on the open waves - their target is a freighter of some kind. The Somali strand moves very quickly; is causality driven - its golden brown tones are a stark contrast to the chilly blues of Vermont. Eventually, we witness our Phillips traverse to Oman, where he will commandeer a freighter ship and take it to port in Asia.Eventually, when both sides are out and on the waves off the coast of Africa, there is a coming together when Phillips' ship seems to drift away from the beaten ground of the shipping lanes and the pirates' crude radar systems reveal such a thing. One of them makes the observation that it has 'wondered away from the herd' and we realise they might just as well be back in their native land hunting some sort of animal. In a genuinely sharp piece of direction, Greengrass kept the actors portraying the crews of the container ship and the pirate boat away from one another so that their initial contact is the first time they all meet anyway... Whilst the pirates have the guns, they are clueless as to the layout of the boat, which of course the crew know inside out - this is a dynamic executed perfectly and entertainingly without being exploitative.The film allows for a basic degree of characterisation between the two crews, dialogue from the pirates outline where they are coming from and why they do what they do. They are quick to stress that they are not terrorist affiliated - most likely, they couldn't give a damn what America fund the Israelis to do to Palestine: it is strictly business, but does the film dodge tackling something a little more substantial because of this? At one other point, the film affords a member of either crew synergy through thematic when one of Phillips' points out that '...we (I) didn't sign up to the Navy' when it seems conflict with an armed group is inevitable, while a pirate who cuts himself on a trap made form broken glass points out he '...didn't come along for this' Both are getting more than they bargained for.Greengrass' approach to the material is to essentially begin the film as a heist picture, one wherein things do not all go according to plan for those attempting the heist; throughout the middle act, there are echoes of 'Die Hard' as the victims of a very sudden, potentially violent, assault must use their wits to get out of it. Amusingly, this develops into a final act which seems to borrow heavily from 'Dog Day Afternoon' for reasons I will not reveal. Not knowing a single thing about the events depicted in the film may have helped in it being as affecting as it was, but this is still a very well made drama with excellent attention to aesthetic and pacing. If you are unfamiliar with the true-story, or indeed the book 'A Captain's Duty' which depicts the events of those fateful few days, you will no doubt enjoy 'Captain Phillips'.",7,0,0,28 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Episode 1 is my first taste of Star Wars; and I'd say I was 'peckish' for more rather than hungry.
","Well, here it is then; my first 'Star Wars' film. I thought it might be better to watch them chronologically rather than in the initial order as I had heard of all the hatred towards this episode so I thought I'd dislike it equally if I'd seen the original trilogy first; hence, I gave it the chance it deserved. On the whole, I'm glad I did.I found the opening half an hour or so rather confusing. I don't know if this was due to the fact this was my first ever taste of Star Wars or if it was just shoddy writing but I'll admit that it was lucky to have a bit of a Star Wars fan watching it with me otherwise I would have been completely lost. What I didn't like was the virtually vacant introduction to Jedi's and what they were (although it's assumed you've seen the other films before this one so I can't hold that against it too much) and the inaudibility of the character of Jar-Jar Binks. What also didn't help was the fact that whenever someone said something, there seemed to be an annoying little 'bleep' noise or an animal/alien moan in the background, rendering what it was they were saying equally inaudible. I thought this was rather laughable so early on as what I found to be a complicated plot set up involving a trade dispute between two planets was made even harder to follow given the fact I couldn't hear what it was that was being said.When these things were ironed out after about twenty five minutes, the film got going and although rather ashamed saying it, I was impressed. I liked how each of the characters interacted with one another, I liked the whole 'double team of Jedi's travelling around helping out' scenario and although the subplot involving Anakin Skywalker and his space racer/eventual fish out of water story was primitive; it was light hearted and enjoyable at the same time. The way the film flicked between the two situations going on and eventually culminating in a feel good finale where they all integrate was good; the trade situation was as compelling as the Anakin storyline and we're never forced to 'side' with the 'better' story as each is given enough screen time.The character of Darth Maul was another interesting thing I noticed during the film. Although he's one of those enemies that hardly ever speaks and is one of those bad guys that 'remains in the background, looming and threatening at all times' (similar to the Terminator in the first Terminator film); I couldn't quite feel the build up nor could I the menacing persona he was meant to carry. The cloaked bad guy who appeared via holograms was more of a menace and this is where the film lacked a little in the end because you knew he was never a threat and all good films/stories like this one have a decent bad guy who is always there trying to thwart the hero(s); in Episode one, there wasn't stone wall evidence of one of these.Even if the way the editing jumps between each story toward the climax is a little predictable in the way it shows the tank battle, the palace surge and the light-saber duel at the same moments in their progression (initial fighting, bad guy(s) get the upper hand, twist of fate, hero(s) winning) it was satisfying and never took itself too seriously. This way of telling the finale, I believe, was Lucas' way of saying 'don't expect an epic; just a satisfying journey coming to an end'. Hardcore Star Wars fans might not like this too much but for the others (namely me) it was a nice introduction to the franchise.",5,5,9,4 March 2007
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 'I don't care which universe you're from - that's gotta hurt!'
","There is one particular scene which probably bothers me over all the others in 'The Phantom Menace', George Lucas' bloated first prequel to his immensely successful initial trilogy: it occurs nearer the end and unfolds during a council meeting - a character turns to Yoda, of all people, and offers an exclamation: 'The Sith? But they've been extinct for a millennium(!)' As if Yoda wouldn't know that. But the line isn't for Yoda, it's for us, and it's infuriating when that happens: characters essentially speaking to the audience, when they ought to be speaking to one another.Aside from being a little long; not especially exciting; too narratively confused; not as funny as it thinks it is and there not being an especially large amount of suspense to proceedings, this opening chronological episode of the Star Wars franchise just suffers from not doing the basics to any competent extent. The film contains four heroes, but no actual protagonist; it possesses something in the region of four villains, but no real antagonist; the narrative is a mess, with the aims and goals of various people either unclear or unexciting.The film drops us head first into a situation involving the government of an exotic planet named Naboo, and a trade federation - both of whom are facing off over varying legalities to do with tariffs. It almost feels as if we've joined thirty minutes late. Two Jedi, Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn and Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi, are arriving to negotiate a truce on behalf of a third party. Neeson has just enough white in his beard to appear journeyed or 'wise'. They are greeted kindly by a droid, lulling us into a false sense of security, but then a series of confusing decisions by two trade federation officers, who are taking orders from no-less than Ian McDiarmid's Palpatine character, leads to the Jedi being attacked and a robot army invading Naboo anyway. What it is that is so special about Naboo, it is never explained. Why anybody thought it a good idea to go to war with two Jedi, it too is never fully explained. Palpatine himself orders the attack - he of all people should know a Jedi's power.Down on the planet, and whilst urgently trying to reach the Queen of Naboo, Amidala (Natalie Portman), Kenobi and Jinn run into Jar-Jar Binks, a strange red creature who's part of the wildlife and who will, before the end, step in some animal faeces; be farted on by a large camel-like creature and be kicked in the balls by a small robot. Finding Amidala, everybody whisks themselves away through the warships and on to a place called Coruscant, where Amidala will be able to rectify the situation.Alas, damage to the ship during the escape forces them to land on an old stomping ground of the series: Tatooine. This leads Jinn to young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a slave who works in an electronics shop for a flying insect and dreams of having a real life. Meanwhile, Palpatine has dispatched the menacing Darth Maul to find them - Maul's introduction is actually quite effective: done so via a hologram communique whereby we cannot really see him and he looms in the background.Around this point, the film comes to a screeching halt - 'Phantom Menace' appearing to take pleasure in stranding its characters in a desert: Jinn is unable to obtain a part for the damaged ship; Anakin partakes in a motor-race, the events of which are relayed to us by a commentator despite the fact we have just seen them, and Binks continues to mess around - everything else involving Naboo has been placed on hold. The pursuit of them, by Maul, carries neither energy nor threat - he is a mere spectre. Perhaps he needed an incidental scene whereby he would enter a Tatooine gas station; toss a coin and demand the proprietor 'call it'...Anakin is probably the closest thing the film has to a lead - of all the characters, he transitions the most and learns the most. He has a goal, to be free and to free his mother, and is heavily involved in what the 'hero' might otherwise be responsible for during the finale. But he isn't introduced early enough, and because the film is aimed at kids, it cannot do this anyway, as it would mean depicting the brutal realities of slave-life.Another problem is suspense: on the one previous occasion a character as skilled as a Jedi Knight appeared to lead a Star Wars film, Episode Six, they were vulnerable, but not in a physical capacity - only to the temptation of undoing all their hard work and falling to the 'dark' side because of an intrinsic link to their enemies. There was no physical threat to them - they were the most powerful character in the film, but it was cleverly negated. Here, Neeson and McGregor's Jedi characters have no real reason to be afraid of anything and have no real vulnerability. This is a major problem, while as individuals, they are so lacking in actual characterisation, that they might as well become one altogether. Beyond this, a rather seminal moment whereby Anakin meets his future spouse is undercut by Binks' tomfoolery; the senate in Coruscant is full of toadies one minute, but works in everyone's favour the next, and we annoyingly discover that Darth Vader was responsible for building C3PO...I suppose it is fun to hear that old cry of 'Wootini!' again, and we smile when Yoda and the Jedi council speculate about what might come of Anakin, but so what? The film possesses three major sequences: the pod-race; the big fight with Maul and the final battle with the android army, but what REALLY transpires around them? For many, this was the moment Lucas torched his own grand design, ruining it for millions of fans in the process. In the immortal words of Jar-Jar Binks: how wuuuude(!).",5,1,3,19 May 2019
3:10 to Yuma," Tearing; tense and challenging race-against-time western as feuding sides and ideologies play out under a canopy of high drama.
","James Mangold's adaptation of the 3:10 to Yuma text is pure pulp in a Western form but with a brain to match: a chase thriller; a morality tale; an interesting clashing of two 'set' American Dream-infused ideologies, as two individual men come together; a power struggle between these two men, further more encompassing the shifting dynamics between other characters as their relations and prior histories with one another are torn and forced together in equality. The film is essentially a telling of getting item 'A' to location 'B', but across the vast and expansive deserts of 19th Century Arizona, as the United States of America was forming. The MacGuffin in this case, the item that kick starts everyone into gear, comes in the living and breathing form of a fearsome bandit – something that doesn't sit there inanimately but is able to have an effect on proceedings. Mangold's film is a masterfully unravelled and tension filled exercise; full of fiercely ambiguous friendships and some deeply rooted rivalries thus perfectly capturing the overall sense of the era as settlers battled against natives; interior clashes between sides played out and the large looming fall out from The Civil War remained.3:10 to Yuma's relatively simplistic premise paves way and allows for intricate study not to get lost amidst a sea of complicated narrative, that further still would quite probably have given way to exposition. As relations shift and understandings are forced into being forged, the film utilises the arc of its antagonist so as to encompass a revisionist element to proceedings; taking its character from a distinct type before placing him in the company of many men whom mean well, tread a finer line between moral and amoral than the antagonist, as well as the lead himself whom embodies the positive traits associated with both a justified living and justified existence. 3:10 eventually rounds off with a finale that signals ultimate change within the individual. The two main players of the piece are Christian Bale's Daniel Evans and Russell Crowe's Ben Wade, Bale maintaining that odd sense of consistency that sees the effectiveness of his acting diminish without totally evaporating when he himself is not the primal focal point of the film and must be placed up against somebody else in direct opposition.Evans is a struggling farmer with wife Alice (Mol) and two sons, the eldest of which William (Lerman) is refreshingly more involved in the film than it needed have bothered. Despite ploughing an honest trade, drought has rendered life as a farm unit particularly difficult for the Evans' and a frustrated William observes the hardships through a growingly bitter eye. Indeed the film begins with him slowly, lingeringly turning over a playing card of a bandit in a darkened room with that prominent sense that one's mind is at an age that sees one shift down respective routes that come to outline one's life. Later on, when local council enforcers burn down one of the Evans' barn when repayment didn't come through, he is there again with a rifle ready to shoot them in the back as they ride off. It takes an older, more level head in father Dan to prevent William from taking the first steps into immorality, such is his young and impressionable personality that later on he hears of a location known as Dodge City from the mouth of outlaw Wade and seems dangerously allured.That person is indeed Ben Wade, an all-in-black clad bandit whose first task it is to observe his minions hold up a stagecoach full of money heading towards a local town from a nearby mountain on high; that sense of power over his followers present in the film positioning him there, far from danger but close enough to see everything that transpires. When it comes to picking apart the wreckage, he wastes no time in taking out survivors and those even in his own clan whom are taken hostage by said survivors. Wade's way of life and character is placed in stark contrast with that of Evans', the film treading a fine line in what it itself thinks of each respective lifestyle in that the life of farming and hardship seems downtrodden and unappealing, with Wade's cut and thrust existence full of action, companionship and reward. But he lives this life with a seemingly respectful eye on his surroundings, toasting to fallen comrades at saloons afterwards and with a strange penchant for sketching the odd item in-between raids. His continuation of indulging in this behaviour later on sees him state proverbs around the Evans' dinner table, at which time the link is made obvious that the character is doing so in the presence of the nourishment brought about by way of moral work instead of the intake of alcohol bought through ill-gotten money.Opportunities arise for Evans when Wade is caught, and sentenced to death by way of hanging in a penitentiary some miles away. The film's premise seeing several people volunteer to transport Wade to a local train station so as he may be transported to meet his fate. Being the financially struggling farmer he is, Evans is all too keen to aid in this action but hostile natives whom own the land everyone must journey through; others out for Wade's blood on personal vendettas and Wade's own gang are elements to be taken into consideration as they all strive to catch the titular train. The film carries that stark, rapid feel about it in that the journeying to the station is a race-against-time element that sits on a back-burner and simmers effectively as this adventure plays out. While certain aiders in this task fall foul of the elements plus Wade's continuous pleas to be let go for a large fee that'll help Evans no end as rainclouds supposedly form over his farm on the horizon, there is enough tension and ambiguity to drag the film through to its stark and effective finale.",8,0,0,12 July 2010
Ali," Proudly takes its place in whatever Hall of Fame there might be for boxing films, as Mann studiously pays tribute to the life and times of 'The Greatest'.
","One of the more famous, more accomplished, more recognisable names and faces in the history of any sport is the subject of Michael Mann's 2001 film entitled Ali. Muhammad Ali was a champion, for that there can be little debate; often when he steps out into the ring whenever it is he does in the film, we do not debate as to whether he might win his fight or not, rather, Mann is more interested in getting to the bottom of a famous man with some often radical views on the world around him: the drama is outside of the ring, not inside. Where the film is a deceptive formulaic piece building and building to a final showdown with which it climaxes, it resembles more-so a humanistic and humbling dramatisation of Ali's often rocky relationships over the years with family members; particular women; business cohorts and the American government. Mann doesn't sugar-coat his depiction of the man; at times in the film, Ali will come across as arrogant; aggressive and rather unkind whereas at others he is victimised by those only seemingly more powerful than he is, but never for once do we doubt the character's ability and head-strong confidence that he has in himself. By the time the famous Zaire based Rumble in the Jungle fight has arrived and Ali is there doing his thing with both his mouth and his fists, we've long since jumped on board and are with him every step of the way.Will Smith does the job of incarnating Muhammad Ali, and does the job stupendously. The film will begin with the man jogging in a drab, cold and rather metallic locale early on in the day. His running activity is inter-cut with a singer on a stage, somebody whipping the crowd into a frenzy and quite clearly being 'at one' with both their surroundings and what they're doing for a living. As the opening progresses, all the activity becomes inter-cut with one of Ali's knockout blows and a similar sense of the boxing ring being Ali's stage upon which he does the equivalent of the singer in relation to the crowd and the 'at oneness' with everything is effectively established. The inaudible hush of a crowd greets us prior to his first fight, some thumping electronic music without lyrics overlying for Ali and his opponent's entrances to the ring. The audience get what they came for; we, as purveyors of a piece of cinema, witness a bringing to life of one of Ali's fights and what it may have been like prior from the perspective of the man himself. All of it carries a feel of cinema, a cinematic charge; where the patrons and lines up in their seats ready for the next slice of spectacle that is Ali's next fight, we are primed and ready for Mann's detailed and involving exploration.Where Ali is a champion fighter and we already know comes the finer details some audience members may not already be informed of: namely, his fights outside of the ring. Mann appears to be aware of Ali as a name even to those uninformed to boxing; laying on fight after fight establishing how superior Ali was to everybody else in his sport would have been futile: the greatest battles Ali had in his life were with family members and those running the nation in which he lived. What he was seemingly fighting for was identity, not the chunks of money that come with boxing matches; what it was he was precisely fighting against appears in the guise of racism, not another faceless boxer in the other corner. The film knows this is more interesting, Mann knows this is more interesting; an eventual fight with Sonny Lister far shorter following the plunging of us into the world of a boxer and what it must feel like before every match you're preparing to go out and partake in.The film's tone is cold; calculated and quite colourless, even distant. We do not necessarily feel alienated from Ali as much as he himself felt alienated from most of those whom he dealt with. His converting to Islam is much to his father's, who's a Christian preacher, dismay; his resisting of the draft to Vietnam for The War on behalf of the U.S. Government leads to widespread annoyances and frustrations on their behalf and his disconnected feel toward the rest of society as fellow African-Americans figures in social and political upheaval are assassinated resonate painfully. A revealing scene later on sees his attitudes and outspoken nature eventually coming to disrupt and, we feel, alienate him from his boxing promoter Don King (Williamson), who was in full flow during a press conference. We felt he was good friends with King, the rapport they shared was amusing and the bouncing off of one another which they appeared to be able to manage was evidently there; the 'turning' on King, indeed everybody in the room bar Angelo (Silver) his faithful trainer, is telling and quite chilling in a way that arrives out of the blue.Was there something about the cameras that wound Ali up? Was it the bustle of the sheer amounts of people at the weigh-ins which set him off? One scene sees him share the front of an automobile with the very man he'll come to fight in a hugely publicised fight; their exchange is anonymous and much calmer, even measured. They speak to one another as two men away from everyone and everything else in what is a direct exchange involving Ali that goes against the majority of what we're provided, but remains equally fascinating despite this sense of polar-opposition within the premise of the situation. Smith is supported by a wonderful performance by Jon Voight, playing true to life sportscast journalist Howard Cosell in what is one of those rare post-Mission: Impossible Jon Voight films that are worth sitting through, as Michael Mann produces another addition to his impressive repertoire.",7,0,1,3 December 2010
Skyfall," No chance of the sky falling in on this franchise JUST yet...
","'Skyfall' proves there is life in the James Bond franchise yet. Indeed, shouldn't these films have died a death already? It is remarkable they are still going, in the wake of the culmination of the Cold War; the initiation of the War on Terror; Britain's own changing place on the world stage as a super-power and the ever-changing tastes that cinema-goers have. Just where does Bond, as both a filmic entity and a character within his own universe, fit in to all of this? The spy thriller demands, when all is said and done, a narrative, but Bond is big-business and very much part of mainstream film culture, which of course isn't interested in narrative. When Daniel Craig sits, pensively, in a gallery staring at a painting of an old warship being tugged away, it doesn't require much thought to work out the allusion. The scene is somewhat spoiled by another character verbally confirming it to us, but there you go. Later on, a scene involving Judi Dench being asked by an obnoxious MP as to what the 'point' of her division is anymore should strike us as probably the series' most existential ever moment.Beginning in Turkey, the film opens with an impressive sequence involving the infiltration of a building; a foot-chase through the dusty streets, which evolves into a car chase, before settling for a battle aboard a freight train as Bond (Craig) and Naomie Harris' Moneypenny strive to reclaim a stolen list of identities of undercover NATO agents. What is striking about this opening, aside from the somewhat awkward moment whereby Bond must 'take-over' driving duties from his female accomplice in order to properly land a fatal blow, is its pessimism - the heroes do not obtain the list; there is no win or quip after all the stunts, just a failure. This is due to Moneypenny accidentally shooting Bond with a sniper rifle (can she do nothing right?) - he falls from the train and a bridge into a river; director Sam Mendes cleverly transposes the sound effects of the running water whilst focusing on a distraught looking Dench in a wet London as rain teems down the window she looks out of. The first words of the title song we hear thereafter are 'this is the end...' We sense then that there is something afoot, and everything thereafter carries with it a strange sense of vulnerability. Bond is not dead, of course, but utilises his time in the wake of his injury to bed women and engage in nefarious drinking games on a Caribbean island while, back home, M (Dench) is told she's being phased out of her role as head of the division. Intelligence is then hit by a cyber-attack. It is to the film's credit that is sets aside time for Bond's rehabilitation back into being an agent of some stature again instead of making the mistake of merely allowing him to be able to pick up where he left off before an alcohol-fuelled sabbatical. What is most impressive about 'Skyfall' is its ability to be able to look back as well as ahead AND be able to systematically tell a decent story of espionage - Mendes has managed to make a Bond film with an opinion on its own status: it has time for the silver Aston Martin, but doesn't think much of the exploding pen gadget. The film is otherwise peppered with the imagery of our time: an exploding London underground train; characters utilising YouTube and has one eye on the dominant role computer run neural networks have in our world. The idea of 'hackers' as villains might have ended up as stale and silly, but the film pulls it off and it even comes across as quite original. A mention must go to Javier Bardem for playing the lead villain in the form of Raoul Silva, whose entrance is put to a long unbroken shot of the man entering a large warehouse on a long-since abandoned island that is therefore stuck in time and so clashes with all the tech-savvy equipment around him. As he talks about controlling the world via the Internet, his terminals begin to look like rolls of razor wire stacked up together thus inferring a sense of the impenetrable. If we are surprised that there are degrees of duality between Bond and Silva after a later reveal, we perhaps should not be - Mendes' had already introduced the pair of them at their respective moments in the same manner: with a long, slow pacing towards the camera.Certainly, after the nature of 'Quantum of Solace', which I did not think terrible but appeared plastic and hurried in the wake of 'Casino Royale', 'Skyfall' brings narrative clarity; genuine excitement and, most importantly, heart back to the series which may exist now in a very different world to the one it was born into, but is nevertheless still able to pack a punch.",7,1,5,28 July 2018
The Hangover," Loud; chaotic and only periodically funny, 'The Hangover' bets big but cannot cash out.
","Do not expect to see anything 'new' in 'The Hangover', which is played for good, old-fashioned bawdy belly laughs. It has no real plot, although is very easy to pitch; possesses very little in the way of characterisation, although lots of people are frequently coming and going from the frame, and on top of everything else, does not seem to have a single thing to say on any particular issue whatsoever. We have already experienced quite a lot of what transpires here in an 'American Pie' film, or some such other contemporary comedy about adults who should know better. Cameos by famous boxers and maybe a liberal use of various pop songs aside, there is very little actually going on.Justin Bartha plays Doug, who is about to be married to Tracy (Barrese), in what promises to be a lavish Californian wedding between two people very much in love. In the opening scene, Doug and his brother-in-law to-be Alan (Galifianakis) are sizing up their wedding day apparel: Doug is shaven, handsome, has a good build and looks smart – he's worn suits in the past and he'll wear them again. Alan, by comparison, is flabby; unshaven and childlike – we do not sense he has ever worn a suit in his life, nor that he has ever had many friends.Ahead of these two men, and before the wedding, is a trip to the Nevada city of Las Vegas, which they are lining up with two more of Doug's friends so as to provide the husband-to-be with a final night of bachelor driven fun and frolics. Of these two men, one is Bradley Cooper's Phil, whom we do not believe for one second is a teacher, while the other is Stuart (Helms), whom we do believe is a dentist and might possess a nice house in a good part of town with a sensible girlfriend who espouses conservative views on gambling and prostitution.Discounting Alan, who is now family and present by default, we are unconvinced that each of these three men would really meet one another in life and hit it off to the extent they would entrust one another on a booze-cruise to Vegas. The film is not especially interested in who any of these people really are or what they think, just that Phil is very bohemian and aggressive; Stu is ultra-defensive due to a white-lie he has told his partner about going in the first place; Doug seems to be a kind of 'glue' which keeps everything from falling apart and that Alan is a little retarded.Once in Las Vegas, the night out gives way to a morning after characterised by a wrecked hotel room and a total lack of memory of what happened. The major problem is that Doug did not wake up in the hotel suite with them. Consumed with panic, the three take to the daytime streets of Vegas on whatever meagre clues they have as they frantically try to piece together just what it was they did last night.The set up allows the film to 'drop' various things on us which we might not otherwise find funny, such as a police car matching their valet ticket; two gangsters popping out of nowhere with baseball bats ready to do serious damage and a nude gentleman jumping out of a car boot. Other films would need to depict why these things are as they are, and would thus lose a lot of impact.'The Hangover' is not without one or two genuine laughs, with the very sudden homage to 'Rain Man' being one of them and a very amusing scene of confusion whereby an exchange with some unruly gangsters returns the 'wrong' Doug. Yet the overriding item permeating throughout is the strange sense of disassociation we feel as Phil; Alan and Stuart charge around various hotspots looking for the groom while essentially trying to save their own skins from various wives and in-laws finding out: Do we care if they find Doug, or that he gets to the wedding? Who is anybody in this film anyway? Why does any of this even matter in the first place? Prior to their losing him, care is taken to set up a series of items which exist to then later be knocked down: Stuart's girlfriend, Melissa, hates Las Vegas and thinks he's gone to a winery; the gang's mode of transportation is an antique silver Mercedes lent to Doug by his fiancé's father, while Stuart's ring belonged to his grandmother, who survived Hitler's Final Solution. Are we surprised, or even amused, when any of these delicately poised things become tarnished or threatened by the chaos which begins to unfold around our leads? The Hangover's director is Todd Phillips, who wrote 2006's 'Borat' and before that directed 'Road Trip'. He later made 'Due Date' in 2010, and 'The Hangover' very much falls into line with that 'Phillips-ian' road movie-comedy-perpetual chaos 'aesthetic' which he seems to enjoy penning and making. 'Borat' was often very funny because of the outlandishness of the central character and what he had to say to real people in real situations. 'Road Trip' was about someone who had to learn to appreciate what he had, while 'Due Date' depicted somebody learning to accept those different to him.'The Hangover' isn't really about anything or anyone. Its opening montage of Vegas set to the gloomy tones of Bill Withers, followed by a shot of the four roadside and looking pretty desperate, seem to set something up on the nature of Vegas, but by the end the consensus seems to be that it's a pretty darned great place to go and that pole dancers make for better wives than conservatives. Once it's finished, we have seen a series of moderately unfunny scenes of no real order or coherence; have laughed maybe twice and been offended at least once. Skipping this particular Hangover is advisable.",5,0,0,11 August 2017
The Ring," Scary and eerie with what you'd expect out of a film like this but The Ring is an overall failure of forced horror.
","The idea that you watch a video tape, receive a phone call and then die within a week of engaging in these two events is an interesting idea but at the same time, not that scary  what is it that's going to cause you to die that is so scary you can't get medical or authoritarian help? But that's what The Ring is; a film that doesn't rely on character logistics or 'what should be done in that situation' but rather relies on eeriness and uncanny things to get across its scares.I will not deny that The Ring is scary because it is a very unnerving and creepy film  although there's no violence or gore, I was still finding myself looking away from the screen once or twice but I realised afterwards that this was due to the fact I had absolutely no idea what it was I was dealing with in the film. If you were to make a ten second film of someone opening a creaky old door, going inside to a pitch black room whilst all the time having eerie music playing over the events and really dark lighting over the images, you'll probably find your audience looking away merely because they don't know who any one is, why what's happening IS happening and what's going to pop out at them. This is The Ring to a tee.The Ring is a horror film that takes a detective route and the character of Rachel Keller (Watts) takes on the detective role in a rather tired way. The introduction to the video tape in question is a very brief and rather crude way of setting up the events  no, I don't believe that fate would have one girl mention 'the tape' literally minutes before the other girl would succumb to its curse and no, I don't believe that characters at the funeral would be able to free roam their way through the bedroom where the death happened since it should be a crime scene, but there is no help in the form of authoritarian figures, remember? This is a world without police and the FBI to investigate strange occurrences which is ironic because at times, The Ring does feel like an episode of The X Files.Once it's established that this tape exists, The Ring turns into a film that relies on its breaking of everyday rules to crank up suspense. I mentioned the bedroom/crime scene occurrence which shouldn't have even happened because people wouldn't have been allowed up there. Also, the car ferry scene where a horse bolts from its carriage due to Keller's presence; again, it shouldn't have happened because once a car ferry starts moving, passengers aren't allowed on the car deck. As it was, that scene was self-motivated by the character of Keller (who could've stepped away when the horse got agitated) and turned out to be rather unpleasant.The film consists of Keller and her sidekick Noah Clay (Henderson) attempting to solve the case of the tape whilst avoiding the uncanny events that happen in-between every now and again. These include the horse/ferry scene, the taking of a fly from the video, nose bleeds, flashing images from the video itself and a creepy Sixth Sense-come-Omen type male child who the film relies on to get most of the uncomfortable atmosphere across; needless to say it works but on a basic level. Why anything's actually scary in The Ring is because you will not have too much of an idea to what is going on. The confusing plot that only really becomes clear in the final fifteen minutes merely toils on your mind more and more as each eerie scene goes past being able to cope with the scares and with the working out of the plot is hard work. The fact the film makers have a license to include just about anything in the form of scares doesn't help too much.I found the finale of the film a little disturbing but only because Keller involves her child in a way that I didn't think was necessary in fact The Ring ends rather downbeat and more like a tragedy when it becomes clear what the motivation of the tape actually is. The Ring has its scares and maybe two jumps at the most but this is very much a case of seen it - don't need to see it again.",6,0,1,9 September 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," All but pillaged over the years as the model blockbuster; here and now, the film neatly withstanding time as a giddy excursion into action/adventure filmmaking.
","Steven Spielberg has always been the sort of director whom, when provided with a 'log-line' or one sentence premise, has been able to use his ability to just grab the idea by the scruff of its neck and run with it. A bunch of people on an isolated tropical island populated by dinosaurs eventually running amok is given a radical overhaul and transformed into something more exciting and more substantial than it has any right to be; a man drives a car over a long distance across the barren states of the U.S.A., but is terrorised by a crazed truck driver becomes something quite special; a cynical parent of two young children faces the fight of his and his family's life when blood thirsty creatures invade Earth and he must guide them to some sort of safety. Raiders of the Lost Ark, along with the likes of the above in Jurassic Park and Duel among others, feeds off Spielberg in this mood and on this form; a feature that comes complete with dastardly villains trying to end the world; unadulterated heroes; feisty sidekicks; love interests; rounded, jolly foreign supporting acts of a differing ethnicity to that of the lead's as well as the Nazis as the bad guys.Following the adventures of one of the best loved protagonists in film history, Raiders begins deep in the jungles of South America sometime in the 1930s; the music ominous, a group of men trudging on to what appears to be the laughter of the wildlife as they undertake a march many have previously attempted, but never completed. One of the men, following in a pack behind that of Harrison Ford's lead Indiana Jones, draws a gun; but our man is whip-smart in a literal sense to the revelation, and manages to hear; react; work his skill with the bull-whip he possesses and then defuse the situation without ever having to use grosser means of violence. We can tell Jones knows his stuff, or does his research; he treats a temple 'no one has ever come out from alive' as if he had been there before and done what he's about to do a dozen times. He ventures in, his accomplice the picture of fear contrasting Jones' own state, and beats the system; swiping the prize and getting back out again – in the process avoiding a boulder who's trigger system has done well to survive all these centuries of people not making it this far.There is something indescribably endearing about a man capable of the above, and yet by day, is a stuttering; glasses-wearing academic whom stammers around wielding arrays of scrolls he struggles to carry properly; in turn, knowing an awful lot about issues and subjects of an archaeological nature most would dismiss as somewhat nerdy. Jones is called upon by the American government to come into contact with a Biblical artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant, a mission laid out in no uncertain terms as being highly dangerous and mostly with the threat of the Nazi party spreading their wings into North Africa to try and find it for their own means. As a Macguffin, Spielberg does his utmost to effectively render the thing near enough to a character all by itself; a dangerous, looming character with what appears to be its own mind and priorities as these pesky early-to-mid twentieth century human-beings toy with it; transport it; fight for it but essentially wake it from its rest. An early revealing of the object in sketch form, lying there on a text book page radiating light and power, acts as an unnerving envisaging of what the thing is capable of. Jones initially rejects the proclaimed 'power' that the Ark has, citing it as something in the region of 'occult mumbo-jumbo', and therein that statement lies a refreshing little transition for Jones to undergo as he learns of its true power and of certain people's dedication towards it.Working with the Nazis is a French archaeologist named René Belloq (Freeman); an 'Id' to Jones' superego: a well dressed and far more formal man to Jones' grizzled demeanour and whose morals are equally spread eagle on the spectrum. Along for the ride, after an excursion in the snowy barren nothingness of Nepal, Jones enlists Marion Ravenwood (Allen), whom he shares a botched romantic history. Ravenwood is a woman capable of holding her own; the sense of the film's overly guilty disposition rife in its having her in the midst of a drinking contest when we first see her, before placing her at the forefront of a sober; competent conversation with that of another human-being minutes later. Ford and Allen bounce off one another to varying degrees of success, their romance of old constantly hovering in the background as we observe the man's shot at redeeming himself to her as a man and not a runaway – the film maintaining her hard bodied edge throughout proceedings without ever sagging to levels of objectification.There is an awful lot to enjoy in Raiders with nary a lot to necessarily get agitated about; the film is flat out adventure from the point of the Ark's uncovering, culminating in an eerie finale during which the culmination of several things explode at once in a dizzying moment of terror and thrills. The film is mostly an array of set pieces and stunts, but there is a grounded sense about the chase and adventure. We do not entrust Jones to be infallible; when he is shot, we grimace; when he takes a beating and bleeds, we observe him stumble his way back up and sense injury. In spite of its nature, the film never threatens to descend into that of anything below taut and engaging; rather, it is mostly a project filling us with a joyous feeling - lovingly constructed by a man out to do what he enjoys most, in making something exuberant that his audience can get stuck into.",7,1,2,10 August 2011
Stop-Loss," Easy to label 'Born of the Fourth of July for the X-Box generation'; but it's an ample enough film with some things to say on some tough issues born out of war.
","Stop-Loss slots nicely into a canon of films populated by 'issue' pieces dealing with the war in the Middle East, or on Terror; a film looking at, as the following year's Rendition did with the detainment rights America seemingly has on terror suspects, the titular 'stop-loss' policy - a ruling forcing veterans back out to the Gulf front lines for more tours of duty against their wishes and against prior agreements with the government. It additionally comes to strike us as the sort of film designed to habituate your more younger adult viewers on the issue of war, warfare and the war in The Middle East; that wars and warfare carry with them side effects, that explosions and wartime hostilities carry with them a shrill price. Through what most would refer to as a process of trivialisation through that of the medium of computer games, and a general skirting around of certain issues, Stop-Loss feels designed to both unearth and bring to the forefront the backlog of hurt and bother that often arrives with what most of Stop-Loss' target audience may already perceive as a passive pursuit.Where the film somewhat flails on the front of the former, and despite feeling like an unabashed 'awareness' piece, it succeeds in bringing attention to the latter; an involving enough documentation of the fallouts of war. In another sense, it did its job on the political front; I was unaware of the stop loss policy, what it entailed and how people might go about dealing with it if in disagreement. The film opens with a sequence of warfare I didn't expect to be as effective as it was. We witness a squad of Iraqi-based American soldiers fighting enemy soldiers still loyal to the causes that desire Western involvement banished from the territories. It is a skirmish that only really kicks off after several of the troops have risen to the bait of an armed man in a car at a checkpoint, whom then promptly leads the gung-ho soldiers into an enclosed street and an ambush. Bullets begin to fly, rockets are propelled and people are hurt in a locale somewhat passingly resembling your bog-standard online multi-player game arena.For several men, it was the last happening of an arduous tour; several soldiers, as well as platoon leader Brandon King (Phillippe) and Channing Tatum's Steve Shriver, both of whom will later come to to contribute to the text more greatly, depart following the tour's termination and head to their home states. King's and Striver's is Texas. Once home, their surroundings are constructed as a somewhat sickly place of pro-war garb and patriotic singing; a place in which all the women are overtly photogenic and the young boys of the town idolise their newly arrived war heroes - director Kimberly Peirce even finds room for a composition of the American flag fluttering limply in the breeze. Suffice to say, the locals are over the moon to have their boys back; the post-tour celebratory party following an opening battle going along way to summarise the general outlook on the war as a whole: we're winning, we're taking heavy losses and a lot of Arabs local to the territories are dying for not an awful lot, but we're winning.The homecoming is sweet on the surface to these people, and on the surface alone; odd behavioural patterns beginning to plague that of what Striver does thus upsetting his fiancé Michelle (Cornish) and forcing King into getting involved, the foul smell of post-traumatic stress disorder filling the air and filling the grounds of Striver's front lawn when the digging of fox holes in the dead of night as well as the persistent speaking to himself plays out. For King, problems rear up when he is a victim of that aforementioned stop-loss policy; a forcing of him back to the hotbeds of The Middle East against his wishes - an order devilishly delivered to him by a Lieutenant colonel played by Timothy Olyphant, whom always looks like he's having fun playing that seedy guy you're supposed to dislike but isn't necessarily the villain, and something that sees King, in his own words, 'screwed by the system'.King takes it upon himself to just leave; a fugitive out on the road with that of Michelle since, y'know, she's prettier and will make for better company than that of his parents. Where the film goes is into the realms of where films such as these, ranging from Taxi Driver to Borne on the Fourth of July, often go; that is to say, a physical journeying that will open the lead's eyes to a 'real' America of stuff they'd previously been somewhat oblivious to. Their cross-country travelling on this occasion sees them journey to Washington D.C., so as to try and garner some help from a senator whom was as kind as you like when King's tour was still fresh in the memory, but then seems totally disinterested. It plods and it waves proverbial flags, but it does the job; along the way, we anticipate King and Michelle's romance - her patching up of his wounds following a brawl an obligatory 'coming-together' moment of a sensual and physical sort. Peirce finds room to rear up the shocking nature of your more decrepit veterans: an excursion to a military hospital dealing with those whom lost limbs and such arriving as further issue-baiting which clunks into proceedings rather than slots neatly. Stop-Loss is not without merit, and surprised me in how far is was willing to go in its politics; it's tough to begrudge the film, and its air of ambiguity as to whether it's a film glorifying the running from's one duty or the standing tall for what one believes in is good value, but I suspect the director has a better film up her sleeve and as far as the War on Terror canon goes, you could do a lot better yourself.",6,0,0,29 August 2011
United 93," An important film that is pretty essential viewing.
","After five years, the events of September the 11th are given the narrative touch and are transformed into a big budget, dramatic silver screen production from 'The Bourne Supremacy' director, Paul Greengrass; and it bodes well.Throughout the years, history has been plagued with humane tragedies such as wars, famines and other such events involving human misery. What United 93 does is take an event that everybody, and I mean everybody, can relate to in their own way and transforms it into something that everybody can experience. Everybody remembers where they were and what they were doing on 9/11 and it's because the events portrayed in the film happened not so long ago, that all the audiences can experience the events unfolding within this two hour or so story before our eyes.It's not film directors' fault that five years after the Holocaust was discovered to have happened; nobody made 'Schindler's List' but we should be honoured that we have been blessed with the fact that this one event that spawned a new world can be exploited on a medium we can all relate to: film, so soon after it happened.United 93 takes on a documentary style which is as clear as day to anybody and we're definitely given the illusion through the camera work and editing that we're meant to actually be there in fact this was confirmed to me about half an hour later during the film when the camera gives a 'second glance' point of view shot/look at the radar when a plane merely disappeared from the screen.What's also odd, but works in juxtaposition is the fact that we already know the outcome of the film. Wanting the protagonists to win and willing them on is absolutely futile as anybody who's either got half a brain cell or is more than five years old knows what's going to happen  it's why recent events that have dominated the news have done for the past few years. Despite this, the tension is still built up very cleverly through means of confusion and (what I presume to be) actual 9/11 news footage, keeping you poised on an absolute cliff hanger every time a new revelation occurs: 'what will happen now? What will they do?' you ask yourself, and you do genuinely care.You might have already read or heard, but the final twenty minutes is absolutely spellbinding. I cannot praise it enough. It's like seeing slaves rise up against their oppressors or the long suffering victims lash out at their captors. In this instance, Arabs whom have struck fear into the innocent passengers on board are forced to give a last stand they didn't plan on doing and you just can't take your eyes from the screen. If the phone rings, you'll ignore it. It's that addictive.Just as 'Schindler's List' was to the Holocaust, United 93 exploits a tragic event and the harrowing circumstances surrounding it into the medium of film for all to experience.",8,0,1,8 November 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Weighty and more than substantial piece flicking through a great deal of emotional substance, on top of what is a magical, creative science fiction drama.
","Aliens. Beings from outer space – touching down on planet Earth with the intent to do whatever they please. Such films with the above premise, indeed any premise revolving around human-beings coming into contact with extra terrestrials, we often find are always so much more interesting when they come to socially, rather than aggressively, intermingle with that of the Earth's inhabitants. We enjoy films such as Robert Wise's original The Day the Earth Stood Still and the recent Peter Jackson funded District 9 a whole lot more than we do, say, Transformers or Independence Day – films about creatures with the ability to journey as far as they can but with nary a lot else to do than reduce Earth to rubble. Somewhere in the midst of all of this lies Spielberg's 1982 film E.T., a film, like the best of the above examples, about an alien creature not coming to Earth with the necessity to destroy it, but to carry a message or explore or, in the titular character's case, desire to make contact.When E.T. begins, it launches itself quietly; ominously and in the mould of Ridley Scott's Alien from a few years previously, as this suspicious glance across the starry night sky to ghostly musical tones dominate proceedings. The set up for an uncanny, fearful representation as we uneasily look up beyond the stars at the unknown appears prominent; the camera tilting downwards revealing a dense Californian forest fore-bearing the literal physical movement that the space ship which eventually arrives will undertake. Out of the ship arrives a flurry of small creatures, shot anonymously as we struggle to focus on them for all the fern and low light. One little fella gets overly curious, gazing long fully over a nearby town from this position on a hill-top having wondered away from his ilk. He appears humble; his kind clearly have the technology to kick something undesirable off with our species but instead gather samples of plants and such, his pensive body language has him appear fearful of us rather than the other way around.Chaos arrives with the coming of some humans; shot equally anonymously in their charging and rushing through the forest, they come via a bevvy of 4x4 trucks whose arrival counterbalances that of the ship's smooth descent. They explore, finding our little creature and give chase; their flashlights juxtaposing this being's increasingly glowing red chest. It stumbles and fumbles to get back to its friends, whom are readying to leave, and thus, we find ourselves going against our own kind and rooting on this little being to make it back. But it is too late: the ship departs without him and the cluster of men eventually go on to loose their target. Within that aforementioned town dwells young Elliot (Thomas), a boy living with his bigger brother Michael (MacNaughton) and younger sister Gertie (Barrymore) alongside their divorced mother in a neat, suburban neighbourhood.When we first observe Elliot, it is on a recreational summer evening with Michael and a few of his friends while they play a board game; Elliot attempts to join in, but is marginalised and kept at bay – a later meeting out in the garden with our space man, whose trundled down from the hills, the catalyst leading Elliot to explore what is, to him, the unknown, just as everything around him is to this space creature. The film branches out into a wondrous, deeply affecting drama about the lead being able to find a proverbial level with a organism after having been marginalised during the board game and by those at school. Tied into proceedings is the thriller aspect consisting of the government agents doing their utmost to find E.T., the strand doing well to maintain tension as these rather defenceless children slowly come to bond with what is the agent's prize whilst the net, unbeknownst to them, closes in.The notion of E.T.'s rejection of the more aggressively inclined, less humble-a being that he is, is a sentiment beautifully, cheekily even, captured in Elliot's bedroom when the boy raises a Boba Fett plastic toy in front of that of E.T. The toy, of the Lucas-film variety, is identified by Elliot as a creature more preoccupied with blasting away at other beings; something epitomising a more shallow-a depiction of aliens that are additionally identified within the comment as being much more rife in popular culture. In having Elliot hold the toy up in the manner he does, E.T. standing in the background but still dominating the frame, Spielberg literally dwarfs this toy in comparison to his bigger; more predominant idea of what should constitute as a filmic alien: Spielberg's is a lot more interesting. The film is a cracking, rollicking adventure; a notion in spite of the fact it rarely gets outside of a quaint suburban home based in one of those bright, perky American estates. It is a film full of a great deal of emotional involvement and heady attachment to the characters, human or otherwise, therein; a film doing its utmost to cover that of a group of siblings cut apart by the divorce of their parents and their consequent realignment through this wondrous catalyst that is the falling to Earth of a space-creature. Consumatley made, imperiously acted by the child-performers and wonderfully tactile in its tonal shifts from coming of age to chase thriller to comedy, E.T. hits most, if not all, of the notes it goes for.",7,1,3,3 August 2011
It," 'Nothing like a little fear to make a paper man crumble.'
","Is 'It' 'very scary'; 'quite scary' or 'not very scary at all'? Well, I would settle on the film being 'pretty bloody scary indeed', if you don't mind(!) Director Andy Muschietti's adaptation of a Stephen King novel, yet to have been given a proper cinematic adaptation to now, is the sort of horror film I find myself being able to get into: rounded protagonists; interesting villains; a real sense of good and evil at play; some genuinely chilling moments and no real reliance on violence to propel the sense you've seen something substantial.The film depicts the exploits of a group of American children in a small fictitious town in the state of Maine during one, long summer holiday in 1989, wherein they dodge bullies; disagreeable parents and a series of odd visions which play on their barest fears. The film opens with a ghostly rendition of the age-old nursery rhyme 'Oranges and Lemons' which, I think, is designed to call to mind Orwell's '1984' wherein it was used as a sort of diegetic overture to the book's depiction of oppression and censorship. Said novel was, of course, about a set of characters living under the yoke of a seemingly unconquerable terror - the likes of which seemed to know your every move and, later on, your inner-most fear...'It' essentially covers the tale of Billy (Jaeden Lieberher), a gawky looking kid with a stammer and a thin build - think DJ Qualls when he was much younger. During the film's preface, set eight months before the rest of the picture, Billy loses his younger brother on a stormy night when a model boat they build is washed away down their street and into the sewer. There, at the grate, he meets the titular 'It' - what appears to be a smooth talking clown with a lazy eye and a devilish grin... Suffice to say, Billy's younger brother doesn't make it home.Declared missing, and making it his mission to find him having felt responsible for sending him out in the storm, the audience, and not Billy, is playfully allowed to know what awaits those who don't let sleeping dogs lie. The film unfolds in such a way that we learn about dozens, even hundreds of other kids who have gone missing over the centuries in the same town and we realise, chillingly, what we saw in the opening has, in some guise, occurred many-a time before. Consequently, we might feel as if we have seen more than perhaps has been shown.Billy, having been told in no uncertain terms to move on by his parents, has a group of friends who are, mostly, with him all the way. What is refreshing about the approach here is that a group of people effectively act as the protagonists - all are victims to the monster's stalking and we are spared a lone, increasingly neurotic, lead wading through on their own.The kids themselves are a pleasingly distinctive bunch: one is a little too sexually aware, but has some wonderfully funny lines; another is crippled by a series of allergies. Beverly (Sophia Lillis) is a red-headed girl with an abusive father, Ben happens to possess a deep understanding of the town having just moved there and had nothing to do but frequent a library. As the film whips along, one does not become lost amidst a sea of supporting acts. Some of the boys' feelings for Beverly, perennially with a key hung around her neck inferring only she can unlock something somewhere, are smoothly mixed into the narrative.Another easy card the film avoids playing lies in what it considers frightening, both within the confines of the film for the characters and for us, the audience. Muschietti avoids going down a route of throwing things at the screen such as snakes and spiders, or rats, in order to get across the scares. Each of the characters has their own particular fear. Afraid of germs? Then you'll have a leper chase you down the street. Just cut off your hair over the sink because you're scared of attracting unwanted sexual attention? It'll come back up the plug and wrap itself around you. Not fond of the rendition of a particular image in a painting? Chances are it'll stalk you through the corridors of your own home.These things don't sound especially frightening by themselves, but it is remarkable, for instance, just how creepy your standard zombie-like creature becomes when it's presented within this context. As for the silly oil painting of the old lady playing a flute which we didn't think was especially frightening when we first saw it - well, we don't think the same by the end...There is even a moment towards the end of the film whereby 'It' suddenly seems to morph its legs to form a kind of arachnid creature in a desperate attempt to frighten the characters because, I think, it is assuming that everybody has some sort of rooted fear of insects or whatnot. This sense of reverting to something at a time of desperation in order to win is noticeable and seems to be the director's way of putting it to other film-makers that throwing things at the screen for sake of it just doesn't work. What does work, however, is part one of this double-header - a pretty outstanding horror feature on its own and well worth checking out if you are a fan of the genre.",7,0,1,28 August 2019
Casablanca," A lot of people say: 'Casablanca is the greatest film ever'  Well, it's definitely one of them.
","Casablanca has stood the test of time in a number of different ways. Given the time and circumstances under which this film was made, it's very easy to see why so many generations have warmed to it.Casablanca leaps into action very impressively; in-fact there is hardly ever a dull moment in this film, contrary to what some people say. The beginning is quick and sets everything up very nicely. We're made aware of the situation, the setting and exactly what goes on here. The little thing the narrator mentions about the German soldiers being killed and some papers missing whets our appetite. It stays at the back of our mind for a while. We also get a good look at our hero's bar/casino and what goes on/who goes there. It's done fairly quickly and very professionally. Never boring, and that's the key adjective to mention. In-fact, the amount of characters we are introduced to is rather effective as we don't really learn too much about them all at once, creating an eerie suspicion about them.The technique of building up a yet unseen character through dialogue is at large here, albeit briefly. The person in question is the eventual 'girl' of the film and we are told that she's been through hell already with a certain someone yet didn't leave them creating the atmosphere that she's someone special who sees things through to the end. This adds to the surprise our hero and us feel when we realise just exactly who it is.The hero's bar is the setting for most of the early exchanges and the mellow music that flows throughout is very nice and adds to the on screen atmosphere. The dialogue Rick (Bogart) is given also adds to the film as we're forced into believing he's a certain type of person: witty, cynical, quick and clever. He doesn't stray away from habits and routines, either. So, when the bombshell arrives and he's suddenly breaking these traits we've come to see him never stray away from, we know something's wrong. Something or someone has forced him into straying away from his own self and suddenly become more serious about things. The dialogue mentioned earlier has done its job and we're hooked.This is shown to us through an effective flashback sequence, which are memories in Rick's mind. The thing here in a filmic sense is that this could've happened at the start of the film, followed by a caption: 'xx years later'. The fact the makers didn't use this standard technique is evidence enough it's different for the good. Similar to 'Citizen Kane' a year earlier; the story is told, briefly, through means of time/space manipulation and it works very well if you've already been caught up in the film.Casablanca never wonders away from its story line or characters. The routine romance plot is maintained throughout and comic quips are thrown in as well once Rick is forced to change. With a script which has stood the test of time like no other and that feeling of tragedy and emptiness flowing throughout, it's no wonder 'we'll always have Casablanca'.",9,1,4,20 July 2006
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Simply remarkable; a fascinating and highly unique experience feeding off of familiar material, all of which combines into something really worthwhile.
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit plays like a high scoring Masters thesis on the various aspects of the film noir genre via an edition of a Beano comic; a placing together of two wildly differing texts inside of a concentrated experiment tank beside lit ACME dynamite, the resultant explosion's remnants being what it is that splatters all over our film screens forming what is a dizzy array of colours and wonder which grabs us from the beginning and never lets up. American director Robert Zemeckis' 1988 film is a deliriously enjoyable noir in its most extremest of forms; a hardened example of cross pollination, further still feeding off of decades of inspiration and homage, just cascading together into something else totally out of the ordinary alá Sin City or Blade Runner, as decidedly postmodern generic fabrications thrust together. Despite the hallmarks of creativity, the film is never preoccupied with its hook; going on to formulate an impressive and really quite affecting character study in amidst a narrative that is challenging; never overbearing and never thinks of its audience as idiots.The film follows a lowly, dishevelled private investigator named Eddie Valiant (Hoskins); a man living off of the reputation he has in solving mysteries that he did so effectively in the days during which his now deceased brother was still alive and working with him. The film wastes little time in constructing Valiant as the embittered lead he is, the hitching of unpaid rides on the rear carts of trams to get around town and the swigging of hard alcohol straight out of the bottle at whatever chance he gets when alone the norm; whereas down at a local bar, a one-time relationship with a waitress that might have gone somewhere, but has now mutated into that of quick acquaintances, the closest he has to a friend. By night, we see him attend an upmarket club that is putting on a comedy double act – where everyone else sees the funny side, Valiant is too indebted to his cynicism to even break a smile.Valiant is a living embodiment of a generic convention if ever there was one, but played with the sorts of creativity and wonder operating around him so much so that we enjoy seeing this familiarised core archetype at the centre of such a premise. He despises those with whom he exists; despises them for that one of them was involved in the death of that aforementioned brother, and the grudge has stuck. Those of whom he exists with are 'toons'; cartoon characters literally walking, talking and existing with the humans within this world of 1947 Los Angeles - a breaking of a reality so shocking, that the film distills how we react through that of its lead when Valiant himself exclaims upon the first instance of that 'wall' being broken.'Toons seem bound to serving that of the humans to some degree, be it in the form of waiting on tables; acting as doormen; barmen or even, in the case of Disney's famous elephant lead Dumbo, an acting talent for a major film studio - one wonders what role it might be possible for Dumbo to play besides that of Dumbo. Director Zemeckis gets all the fun of the fair out of these ideas, accommodating various 'toons to professions that suit their characteristics, in that an exceptionally large gorilla is a doorman; an octopus is able to work several orders at once behind the bar and animated penguins make for waddling waiters serving customers.In the grandest of noir traditions, corruption where there really ought not be any, is afoot; Christopher Lloyd's local judicial chief, aptly named Doom, and his team of 'toon weasel assistants form the film's source of conflict. Doom's arrival, clad all in black and with a walking stick plus-limp creating a false sense of harmlessness, is via a canted angle as Valiant peers upwards at him; an apparent oneupmanship already underway as Doom incorrectly entrusts to have caught Valiant in an act. Doom and his team are scouring the city for the titular Roger Rabbit following the belief he murdered a film producer. His 'toon wife Jessica, uniquely sporting human-like characteristics away from those of an anthropomorphic nature, was involved with this producer but it is a crime Roger maintains he did not commit. In crying out to Valiant for help, in turn offering him the chance to put to bed his 'toon-hating ways and going back on a case he'd only previously had taken with his brother whose death still resonates, the fun that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit kicks off.Where a lot of noir's tone is born out of post-war disillusionment, the two very different inflections of Valiant and Roger clash head-on in a physical sense when the lead finds himself working with him, a raucous 'toon whom cannot help but exclaim loudly and proudly at whatever chance he gets, making for great humour when in danger, and yet stands in stark binary opposition to that of Valiant's more downcast stature eventually making for excellent comedy and drama. Zemeckis deals with everything wonderfully well, using such a concept to act as a backdrop to intelligent film-making and utilising such a notion to formulate wondrous comedy in what is a thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly smart comedy; a film that rocks along without letting up for a second. From its audacious opening to its familiar finale of good vs. evil fighting one on one, only with a total overhaul of creativity and mirth via the dizzy array of ideas the screenwriters are permitted to work with given the setting, the film is at once wholly rich in detail between animation and live-action; funny for people of most ages; arrives with a real sense of threat and danger maintaining drama and generally instills a good feeling.",7,0,0,3 June 2011
Minority Report," Arrogant and misjudged science fiction blockbuster trying to combine thrills with spills with nasty, visceral content resulting in sheer mediocrity.
","Spielberg's Minority Report is a sprawling, maddening, grotesque spectacle; a film that darts all over the place, catering for mainstream tastes in chase and action sequences but desperately trying to provide more substantial weight and content for the rest of us in the form of typically dystopian futures full of technology and modernity run amok; all the while complimented by wondrous visuals. Included in a number of top ten of the year lists when it was released and equally so for the decade, although mostly from American critics, mind; Minority Report's pompous and nonsensical attitude is matched only by its misjudged and somewhat misguided approach of romping through a beautifully created world, spawned entirely from computer generated imagery, as fans of either Cruise and/or Spielberg get to attend their latest flick and tick off the genre conventions under a faux banner of entertainment.The film, one of those from Spielberg that again sees him attempt to combine style with substance and filter them both through a number of genres so long as there's a glut of action in there somewhere, does not match what he achieved in the likes of Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan; films that maintained a steady sense of threat around a number of sequences that although contained a fair deal of action, saw overwhelming odds stacked against the characters we focused on as superior forces moved in for the kill. Where once was genuine threat has been replaced with a hollow, inconsistent film-going experience. Minority Report sees a similar basis for a would-be action film unravel, but it feels unfocused and the scenes of chase twinned with the evasion of apprehension evoke more of a sense of excitement than a genuine sense of fear. Spielberg's maturity as a director over the years has seen him be able to combine degrees of substance with his approach of providing a spectacle, and its been on display in the past through better films than this; but in Minority Report, he gleefully hops along from chase, to gross-out content, to flimsy cover-up narrative in what is a pretty ordinary film.The film takes place in Washington D.C. It's the year 2054, a further example of a Spielberg film not set in the present day. It sees Tom Cruise's John Anderton work as law enforcer at the 'pre-crime' unit, a branch that sees future crimes before sending units out and preventing them from happening. The opening murder takes place in one of those typical, supposedly idyllic American suburban neighbourhoods, as a crime of passion plays out - something instigated by a married man going back for his glasses which, of course, enable him to 'see' everything better than he already can – there are a lot of references in the film to eyes, and the ability to 'see' stuff. Like many-a lone male lead living in far off dystopian futures, Anderton has a past tragedy he must live with, something that fast tracks development in a character and reveals the character's soon-to-be evident ability to deal with anything that comes his way – if he can suffer through the loss of his son and consequently live with it, he can wade on through anything, right? Minority Report uses a harsh, would-be rough around the edges approach combined with a polished and generally gleaming aesthetic to attract crowds in order to produce something that wants to be gritty and edgy, but just comes across as well refined, pseudo and quaint. This, as notions and ideas of 'looking' and 'watching' over the population by the state itself in this future world crudely evokes Orwell, while the exploration of these ideas are presented by way of daft, clumsily included quotes on behalf of supporting characters the lead casually interacts with; best highlighted when laugh inducing lines such as 'In the valley of the blind, the one eyed man is king' are uttered from a blind drug dealer. On another occasion; an ugly, naked, young woman whom lies in a shallow pool of water all day foreseeing the future, known as a 'cog', grabs the lead's arm and melodramatically asks him 'Can you see!?' The film's primary source of antagonism is a joke of a villain in Colin Farrell's suited, booted, stern faced bad guy named Danny Witwer; a guy who swaggers around issuing obligatory threats in an obligatory tone and jabbers some spiritual nonsense which makes him seem smarter/scarier than he actually is. His presence renders the film one in which a powerful, mostly unseen enemy hunts a somewhat harmless and decidedly innocent individual caught up in a fantastic predicament that wasn't any of their doing, combining this with a labyrinth of a narrative we loose all interest in long before it concludes. For better examples that come with more substance, see either 1959's North by Northwest or any of the first three Terminator films. Minority Report maintains a pretty nonchalant attitude throughout, it's more in awe of itself than we are. The film's extended screen time that it gives to shots of the technology at the pre-crime lab's disposal, very early on, when all the moving around of this and that on some screens are overly emphasised – the camera lingering on Cruise use the technology for longer than it needs to.With a stuck up tone, a load of caricatures running around another world brought to life, but wasted on with a tired chase/corruption narrative as well as a distinctly misguided tone, Minority Report is a wavering mess; a truly daft experience running on empty. The worst scene is the occasion in which the lead stumbles into an over-sized greenhouse where an elderly woman lays out the entire film for us: pure exposition. For all the running around and evading capture, an awful lot feels like it gets done than actually is done. Spielberg would make edgier, more interesting films than this nonsense later on in the decade; see those attempts over this one.",5,4,7,7 January 2010
Lifeboat," Gripping and absorbing singular locale set piece that's right up there with its director's best work.
","If Lifeboat isn't one of the great, unheard of Hitchcock films that he ever made, then I guess I must just have been more ignorant prior to watching it than I thought. The film is a simple, routine and straight forward drama driven by script and scenario which works better than most dramas do having had a gazillion-and-one things thrown at it. Set in one location for its entire duration, and I read drawing on influence from a stage show of similar ilk, Lifeboat is a never anything less than fascinating film feeding off this really effective sense of isolation and being stranded with different classes; genders and the enemy. It is a survival film, but a film wherein characters must use their wits and minds to work through situations; one wherein writers must use their own respective qualities in this department to further things along whilst running on a minimalist premise. When the on screen drama comes off, and the author is firing on all cylinders in the manner they are here with what they have their characters say; do and how they manipulate fate to up the ante, the results are quite extraordinary pieces of film-making. Lifeboat is one of these instances.The film covers an array of personnel aboard a lifeboat, the titular lifeboat; a small yet large enough vessel for all half a dozen or so people coming to terms with the fact their ship has been shelled by a German U-boat in the Atlantic and they are now stuck riding the waves of the open sea. We are in the middle of The Second World War and, in a cruel twist of fate, the U-boat itself is struck and sunk resulting in a lone German sailor clambering aboard and into the fray. This of course causes issues given the global situation, but adds an extra dimension to things via the problem with the language barrier.One might say the presence of these people together like this is representative of how people at the time came to find themselves stuck in a situation of global conflict as a whole. Different folk of British and American ilk, some female and some male; some white and one even African American – all of different classes and backgrounds, are here all together in the same boat (quite literally) at the bereft of a German attack no one saw coming and no one expected would interrupt their pleasant lives as they ploughed on. The presence of a German is intriguing in this sense, if beyond the fact it might act as a petty source for some form of antagonism in the future. Where cries of 'propaganda' might arise, it is interesting to observe just how much more bloodthirsty certain American characters are in this film during this time of German induced mass-slaughter in Europe. Here, the German is not a beacon of evil or a mere stock villain; he is just as smart (if not smarter) than anyone else and is depicted as his own entity with a realistic set of goals for the scenario.The film is beautifully paced and wonderfully directed; taking this premise of a bunch of people trapped in a boat and wrenching out as much heightened tension and such as possible without ever becoming stuck or just feeling like it were plodding along. Concept drams such as these have worked well in the past, films one can pitch in a sentence or a single line; in 1994 film Speed's case, a character is even able to outline three quarters (or the part most people remember) of the plot through a line of dialogue one feels they might say in that situation anyway regarding bombs on buses and the figures behind such a situation. There is less of that sense of spectacle in Lifeboat, but that same sense of energy and drama. The film doesn't have the room for its characters that films such as Cellular did, its inhabitants are stuck where they stand, but if we desire cause and effect to drive the proceedings, the 'cause' must often from within the craft itself while the 'effect' must then go on to have such a thing on everyone in said craft. If there was one film you had to see in addition to the standardised Hitchcock canon, one that didn't get the reputation and word of mouth most in said canon do, make it Lifeboat.",8,1,1,25 February 2013
Training Day," Watch it for Washington's performance; some well made, unpredictable scenes and let it just draw you in.
","What we have with Training Day is a big mixture of: gangster, crime, cop/buddy and something close to resembling a ghetto drama all in one. Needless to say that all these aspects of the film work together in a reasonably effective way which, in the end, leaves you feeling satisfied. There are individual strokes of greatness but these are limited to things like Denzil Washington's performance who reminded me of a Wesley Snipes character out of something like 'New Jack City' (1991). There is also the element of unpredictability for the best part as relative rookie Jake (Hawke) gets put through some pretty harsh paces for the first forty minutes or so.I came away from Training Day liking it overall but there were some distinct things that had me thinking to myself 'Yeah, I see exactly what they're trying to do here.' And this is relatable to the 'buddy/cop' sequence. Jake and Alonzo (Washington) are the absolute binary opposites of one another: you couldn't get two more different characters. One is a 'desk' cop who books illegally parked cars and probably takes the odd trip to the doughnut shop one too many times (although his build doesn't suggest this) whereas Alonzo is one of those cops you see in films and if you were ever going to become a law enforcer, you'd want to live their lifestyle: guns, girls and plenty of softly earned drug money. Although this is nothing new, it was refreshing to see it done in an unpredictable manner and of course, Washington's performance sees it out.Secondly, the way in which each character acts  Jake seems sharper and wants to do everything by the book whereas Alonzo's methods include something more reminiscent of: instead of arresting two rapists, just threaten in an extreme manner to shoot their genitalia off if they catch them doing it again and let them go. Jake even talks and dresses differently and of course, Ethan Hawke is a white Caucasian American  Washington is coloured so these two characters make for great entertainment in an easily explosive situation when you've got two people so different in looks and lifestyles.Thanks to some good film-making, certain situations of tension and spontaneity happen and are carried out well. These situations are also very awkward and since we're supposed to map onto the character of Jake more so than Alonzo, we do sort of feel what he's feeling  again, this is thanks to Washington's amazing performance; especially when he either forces Jake to take a smoke of some drugs or when someone is unexpectedly shot and Jake is panting heavily or even when they drive though a bad neighbourhood and Alonzo states: 'Don't you ever come here without me' as black ghetto gangsters eye up the vehicle. Although this manipulates our opinions on Jake as a bit of a wimp and further makes us think Alonzo is sort of invincible, the payoff for thinking these things is great  the filmmakers make us think of one thing so much that all the odds seemed stacked against us later on.What was also clever is the way in which the film can change so dramatically  although not entirely realistic all the time, one situation or setting can very quickly change in an instant. This could include when Jake is in big trouble with some Mexican gangsters but gets out of jail thanks to a previous deed that he did. Although this was a bit of a fluke, it would still be possible in the tightly knitted world of crime that particular city possesses. Although these changes are unpredictable and entertaining, lines must be drawn somewhere especially in which the finale is played out: where several characters seem to switch sides to team up with a guy who they've known of for about twelve hours, which was a little unbelievable.In the long run, Training Day is a very entertaining film that doesn't cover too much ground in terms of innovation or anything deeper than that but it is a clever example of how to suck an audience in and play with them later on.",7,4,8,4 August 2007
In Bruges," Enjoyable and funny but never loosing focus in both its narrative and study, In Bruges hits most marks rather impressively.
","What a neat, compact and thoroughly entertaining little package In Bruges actually is - a film that never takes itself too seriously, but will have you feeling some sort of slap of emotion if you've gone with it by the time the finale has arrived. The film is an extremely black comic piece, relying on jokes and humour that targets specific ethnicities and 'types' of people but at the same time includes the necessary substance through slyly introducing events and flashbacks, confirming why certain characters carry certain hate ridden and confused opinions on their surroundings. The film is encouraging in another sense; a British director running on British fuelled money directing a debut piece he also wrote and quite clearly using other British co-writers/directors from recent times as a source of inspiration.The sources for this inspiration range from Guy Ritichie to Simon Pegg with an essence of Jonathan Glazer's 2000 gangster outing Sexy Beast thrown in for good measure and it all pulls through rather nicely. Interestingly, fellow writer/director Martin McDonagh pays tribute, not necessarily directly to these people but certainly acknowledges he's updating and referencing, very early on when one of the lead characters stumbles across a film set. Here, he meets a young Belgian female production assistant and she exclaims that 'what we're doing here is an homage; a pastiche is too strong-a word for the project'. The lead's confused reaction might well be the same for some audience members but the girl has nailed it and McDonagh has nailed it in his own screenplay.It is a homage; maybe pastiche IS too strong-a word but it is poignant this exchange happens on a film set. McDonagh has cleverly brandished his two leads Irish, making it particularly difficult to label them British gangsters of sorts but you know exactly where he's coming from. In Bruges sees two Irish hit men hiding out in the Belgian city of Bruges following a botched job. Their orders are to wait for a phone call from English mafia boss Harry (Fiennes) as he assesses the situation but Harry has a dilemma and when he does call, his intentions are far more menacing. But that would be spoiling the fun. The two leads are Ken (Gleeson) and Ray (Farrell) and their initial time spent there has the film crack its best jokes that are particularly un-PC but also sees the script establish several complex emotional pieces of substance to back up the content. It appears Ray is having a bit of a break down and thus resorts to verbal insults and discrimination as well as adopting a relatively childlike persona, best highlighted at his glee at the sight of dwarfs, beer and his bemoaning at the sights of historical buildings.Since we do not get to know Ray prior to his 'tragedy', we cannot compare mentalities before/after. Ken seems to have known Ray for a certain amount of time and acts as a foil to Ray once all the bickering in Bruges begins. The important thing here is that Ken actually replies to Ray's bickering so all the complaining and un-PC comments Ray says in Belgium probably does not reflect the kind of person he really is. If he'd been like this even 'before' the event, perhaps Ken would've got sick of always snapping back and might've let Ray just get on with it. If Ray is an assassin, we expect a certain degree of professionalism from him but what we get is a spoilt child performance conflicting archetypes. He is, indeed, referred to as 'the boy' by characters later on.Ray's badgering sees him insult the Belgians, fat people, autistic people and dwarfs but this sort of neurotic behaviour is confirmed when it becomes apparent Ray's suffering an identity crisis and is branching off into a mindset of guilt and suicidal ideation, hence his too sharp-a tongue and insults. For a long time, we share Ken's viewpoint. We are disgusted at Ray's dialogue and we get to hear first hand of the revelation Harry calls up with. But the perspective begins to shift quite brilliantly when things become apparent and emotion comes to the forefront.Ralph Fiennes' Harry Waters is introduced brilliantly. He carries a Don Logan persona about him and the same air of menace with the constant badgering and talk of things seemingly innocent and random, only off screen down a telephone. Our first actual look at him in his England home whilst on the phone is a really tasty piece of editing. McDonagh's fast, wise talking gangsters are indebted to Guy Ritchie and his branching off into a fast paced action film that actually has its characters acknowledge the finale is nearing and that 'this is the shootout' nearer the end is more a link to Hot Fuzz than anything else. Again, the film set location within the film pops up at the end and it's no coincidence this is where the fatal blows are played out.While nobody weeps for the priest Ray killed on the job in the flashback and the fact Harry has young kids of his own which is quite alarming, the film is brutally entertaining and shot in cold, bleak and distant colours commending the psychological feelings Ray goes through. The film begins in a jovial and juvenile manner but we're hit with a brick that knocks both us and the film into focus rather than off course, which is very refreshing for a change. Fast; witty and quite humbling at times, In Bruges is a winner.",7,1,3,14 February 2009
Gravity," Trite and overrated, although not totally lacking merit - Gravity is ultimately disappointing.
","I think 'Gravity' must be the first ever instance of a screensaver being re-calibrated and re-packaged as a cinematic experience. It's all well and good demonstrating what the latest and greatest in special effects is capable of, but of what use is it without a scrap of substance to back it up? Rebellious though it may sound, films such as 'Gravity' are neither enhancing nor prolonging cinema, in fact they are killing it and if there is a genuine zeitgeist amongst audiences that this is the future then cinema has very little future to look forward to.'Gravity' opens with a blank screen followed by a series of ultimately pointless statistics pertaining to the nature of the space vacuum. Its temperatures, we're told, 'fluctuate between minus 148 and positive 258'. 'Sound' it says 'is unable travel' So what? To what is this any reference? Where is this relevant later on? We then begin with a startling composition of the lower hemisphere of Earth from outer space - our eyes are distracted by the land mass to the left of the frame as it slowly comes to form due to the Earth's rotating, failing to notice the object which sails into our eye-line from the hard right of the screen.Lo-and-behold, it is the Hubble Telescope, and we meet our characters in the midst of spacewalking their way to upgrading said telescope. One of them is Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney - a Texan stereotype with a brash attitude; a love of old cars, country music and a backstory that saw his ex-wife leave him 20 years ago. His opposite number is Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone, a comparative rookie; a woman who doesn't really belong in space, whose past tragedy is her young daughter's recent death and who seems to be perpetually nervous when compared to Kowalski's bombing around confidently on a jetpack.Disaster strikes when, out of nowhere, debris from an exploded satellite that has collided with a second satellite sends a glut of space junk the way of our leads. There is some clumsy propaganda about it being the fault of the Russian Federation, but this all acts as the catalyst for Cuarón's feature to turn into a mad dash for the sanctuary of a working spaceship, and then home, as the methodical Kowalski and the unhinged rookie Stone grapple with both one another and the elements.Understanding why 'Gravity' has done so well and received a lot of praise is at once both baffling and painstakingly obvious. It is an incredibly simplistic film - people take to it because of its linear nature; easy causality and the not having to follow any kind of narrative. Much in the same way crowds took to James Cameron's 'Avatar' for similar reasons, the special effects play their role in hooking people in. It is also the case a character you expect to be around by the end is removed from the piece very early on, which I think has stunned people into thinking they've seen something of greater substance because they've not previously seen it happen.The film essentially consists of a string of action set pieces told from the constrained perspective of those involved as they dodge a series of life threatening near-misses. Some of these are born out of the chance event of the space debris flying their way; others rely on the more convoluted occurrence of an onboard fire. Limited air supply also acts as a rudimentary source of drama. These set pieces might well happen in any order and be of any length of time. There is a heavy reliance on imagery and visuals; a complete lack of story and an all but total lack of complexity.The film's apparent core strength, that of a strong female lead in Bullock's character, raises further questions. She has short hair; a boy's name (Ryan - something the film bothers to bring to our attention when Kowalski mentions it) and gets to fulfill the role of an astronaut - a job otherwise synonymous with men. She is androgynous in this respect, but it is Alan Evans writing for 'The Guardian' who points out that she needs either chance or other men to rescue her from every situation - rarely does she use her own ingenuity and, indeed, spends most of the film a gibbering wreck. The over-not to mention needless-use of shots of her dressed in her underwear when not in a space-suit is equally perplexing.I accept, on the one hand, the majesty of the special effects and their ability to bring planet Earth to life as this rotating orb of blue ocean; white cloud cover and green land mass, as we float around in the space vacuum. In terms of characterisation, Cuarón seems to want to tell a story about somebody dealing with grief; discovering that life carries on and coming to want to grab it by the horns again, and this is admirable - but it gets lost. I note with deference as to how small and insignificant the film seems to want to tell us we really are in the grand scheme of things: Earth; Space; the Universe, etc.And yet, the film is piecemeal and ultimately a little underwhelming - dare I say even dull? People have mistaken well-worn disaster movie genre tropes for top-level art because it had a shiny surface, or because they felt like they were able to reach out and touch it, or something. If enough people get it into their heads that this is the future of film-making or what constitutes a cinematic experience, then there will not be much of a future to look forward to.",5,0,3,29 July 2017
Erin Brockovich," Rather an enthralling film covering a woman on the brink, effectively covering her aiding the victimised and then coping with her own life.
","Erin Brokovich is the remarkable true story of a beauty pageant contestant turned legal expert whom very gradually uncovered levels of corruption within a California based power company. One of the many joys of the film lies in how director Steven Soderbergh takes what should be the ultimate tale of a character or person well out of their depth and integrates them into their new surroundings so much so, that it turns out they are both infinitely more qualified and more able in dealing with the situation than some of their contemporaries. The film has all the charge and dramatic punch of a scuzzy, hard boiled revenge film as it covers an enraged lead on a mission in which no one will get in their way; its Conservitive core isn't heavy handed and the film's documentation of a tale dominated by themes of female empowerment is, pleasingly, never for a second interested in the objectification of its lead, despite the field from whence they herald and despite their more usual attire. One of the key exchanges highlighting the lead's newfound sense of identity within the world of law and investigation sees her speak to some of the victims of a power company's leak of some toxins into the local water supply, an event which happened some years ago. The child of the family can speak to our lead, they can speak to her in a way that they couldn't when a suit-clad, official, law degree wielding individual would come round to visit. The fish is most certainly out of the water but finding life easier and more digestible up on dry land, it seems.It is Julia Roberts playing American jobber turned beauty pageant competitor Erin Brockovich, the divorced single mother of three children striving to get by after a car accident and the loss of a consequential lawsuit leaves her with seventy-five dollars left. One of the very first instances we have of Brockovich engaging in official office-talk in a strictly business-like fashion is when dialogue with a doctor plays out, his background out of a nearby window occupied by tall, domineering buildings with a lone empty alcohol bottle occupying the space immediately behind Erin as suggestions of dishevelment draw in. While Brockovich herself was never an alcoholic, subtle props placed to reflect a respective situation work well; this early defeat aiding in getting across a sense of magnitude later on when we realise how far she's gone in taking on the nature of situations such as these and the officials at the core of these predicaments.Erin is supported by her lawyer Ed Masry (Finney), a man whom grants her a job at his small law firm when an outburst in court following the aforementioned car accident and consequent injury sees that particular claim fall through. From the bottom working upwards, the film is a joyous and deeply captivating tale of a woman on a road she had no real idea existed, ploughing onwards towards a hopeful victory. The sense that Brockovich is out of her depth or isn't immediately of the law firm ilk is effectively dealt with early on. Whilst working at the offices, Erin doesn't go to lunch with the other girls because 'she's not like the other girls'; her attire and informal mannerisms as she scoots around the office, verbally badgering Masry on occasion puts her in stark contrast to the other woman of the office whom spend most of their time passively occupying a space behind a desk and possessing a thoroughly different overall stature.Oral and visual confirmations of her respective situation as a person there are behind us by the time the tale has taken centre stage, an uncovering of some menial files which launches Erin into her quest the catalyst. The film is a superb documentation of this case involving injustices to a number of people in a small Californian town named Hinkley, as an electrical company and a water supply occupy the forefront of the case. The film very cleverly has a child take centre stage when Erin visits one of the victimised families, and that sense of the corporation being of an even nastier ilk than to how we may have previously felt, is slyly hit home by the film when it transpires an infant has been severely wronged by these people. On another strand, Erin's private life creeps into proceedings as neighbouring Hell's Angel biker George (Eckhart) becomes somewhat of a love interest, while her children become disenchanted by their mother's full time work; George being another character whom, like the loose, extroverted and former beauty pageant contest entering Erin, is granted a deconstruction of sorts and documented as anything but what prior conceptions we may have of them. It turns out he's good with her children, a kind man and is apologetic during their first encounter when he revs a motorcycle on his driveway too loudly, too late on.Indeed, the film pokes fun at how it could've used both Brockovich's demeanour and appearance. Allowing the fact this highly attractive woman, whom in usually on show in a vast range of cheap outfits, is at the centre of this really fascinating and humbling story, but only once uses her sexuality or 'to-be-looked-at-ness' as an example of principal involvement. The amusing sequence briefly hands Erin a seductive characteristic when she manages to con her way past a young male desk clerk and into an archival room doubling up as a mine of gold for the prosecution. As the clerk watches The Wheel of Fortune on a television, Erin spins the proverbial whilst somewhat illegally accessing the files she'll need. The film is refreshing and immense fun; Roberts, through her character, capturing a real sense desperation mixed with dedication blended with eccentricity as she soars on integrating with all around her, in what is an unremittingly engaging text based on true tale.",8,0,1,30 September 2010
Unbreakable," Very well done film about self-discovery and remarkably; works as a superhero film as well.
","About three quarters of the way into Unbreakable, I was thinking of some very high praise indeed of director M Night Shyamalan; I was thinking that this film that he has made here is probably what 2000s X-Men would've looked like had Stanley Kubrick still been alive and had he been obscure enough to take on such a project. High praise, indeed. Oddly enough, X-Men came out in the same calendar year as Unbreakable but sadly, that is where the similarities end.So if Unbreakable is Kubrick crossed with X-Men, it should be an up in the air, some good-some bad, topsy-turvy picture about characters who have problems whilst at the same, maintaining a strong visual and aesthetical sense when dealing with themes and notions  erm; well Unbreakable does have an impressive cast and it does slowly, in an eerie and mythical sort of a way, build up to a point where it explodes in a bout of emotion as a certain character suffers an epiphany that lasts a few scenes; but apart from those things, Unbreakable is a steady if not unspectacular ride through the actual psyche of a superhero. Unbreakable was made at a time when super hero films were not really of a common nature: Batman had been and then been respectively killed off; Superman had enjoyed some success but had died a death following a lacklustre 80s sequel or two and most other superheroes like Flash Gordon or Supergirl were given nothing more than camp live action cartoons for films.But then you have Unbreakable, a film that has its idea as: What if you were a superhero, you just didn't know it yet? David Dunn (Willis) plays everyday man-come-superhero who is stronger and more aware than he thinks; using telekinetic powers and the ability to predict things before they have a realistic chance of happening. Then you have Elijah Price (Jackson), the fittingly named Mr. Glass as his bones are so weak, he so much as even sneezes violently, he could do himself some serious damage. There are two things that play on the audience's minds from this: the first is Dunn's moody and depressed attitude he has but also his mysteriousness that he carries, especially after surviving a train wreck in the first scene. The second is the vulnerability to Price; a man who would be willing to chase a man down a flight of subway stairs if it meant putting himself at great risk, but proving to himself at least, that he was correct in assuming something. This is where we wince and cringe as Price puts himself at risk for various items of information; an impressive thing to be able to do in a film.Close attention has also been paid to the way the film looks and the way it has been shot; I think Shyamalan has, in all of his films regardless of overall quality, shot and produced wonderful cinematography to capture the mood and feel of the film; be it of the depressing, dreamlike or fairytale variety. Here, the long takes and bleak cinematography compliment the camera work which is vast in its moving around and tracking as it focuses on its subjects. The camera-work retains a certain point of view feeling; there the very first scene to talk about in which we see Dunn and a random woman talk on the train; we see it from through the gap in the seats in front, retaining a child-like quality for the composition since I feel it's the sort of thing a child may do when fed up and sitting on a train; this echo's Shyamalan's later film Lady in the Water which itself was a child-like fable. But, there is also sweeping camera over the roof of Dunn's car as he finds the note from Price; again, this was a sort of point of view composition as the director utilises reflections and patterns on screen.I think Unbreakable is a fascinating film for other reasons, though. I think it's quite funny how, nearer the beginning, Price tries to talk to Willis' character about how he could well be this hard-bodied superhero and Willis plays him down. This is, of course, Willis going against what he had been doing practically his whole career up to this point: playing the hard-bodied action guy but now he is denying that he has any kind of those characteristics; interesting to read further into it, is that Willis played a clam and more sedate character in Shyamalan's previous film The Sixth Sense. However, while the look of the film is impressive and the camera work long, slow and deliberate; Price seems to be convinced a little too easily that Dunn is his man since there are more disasters that happen in the world that Price would lead us onto believe; does the man Price is looking for have to be American? There is also the segment that focuses on Dunn trying to re-fall in love with his estranged wife that seems a little out of place in a film all about finding ones identity within.But while the climax and the denouement would have Dunn rather obviously facing his fears whilst systematically coming to terms with whom or what he is, some may complain it is too short and sudden to be entertaining and too incidental to feel original. While these are small complaints, Unbreakable remains a strong and teasing picture about self-discovery; about what it's like to find yourself and about what it's like to help people; to stand up and be responsible when you discover you are able to be. Shyamalan may not have made a masterpiece but he has made a film that is interesting and unpredictable for the best part while making us want more after it has finished.",7,0,0,27 February 2008
Star Trek," Story and substance come second to a brave, brash and thoroughly accomplished rebooting of some old favourites.
","The 2009 rebooting, re-envisaging of the Star Trek franchise drops us head first into its franchise's latest adventure - adventures often consisting of large groups of shrewd crew members commandeering grandiose, deep-space travelling vessels and getting into strife for our viewing pleasure. As if a dogfight between two spaceships wasn't enough to open a science fiction/action blockbuster, American director J.J. Abrams throws in a significant death, on top of an equally significant birth; a time travelling space ship ganging up on a ship half its size and a highly dramatic escape sequence. You can practically see the grin on the man's face as he unleashes this opening sequence onto fans of the franchise, who are likely stoked to the point of frenzy in the first place.If the general consensus was that the generation of Enterprise crew members whom followed that of the original crew, consisting of Kirk et al, were never quite of that standard in energy and engagement, and that the films of post-1991 followed a similar suite, then Abrams effectively blasts his way into a new era; new canon and new depictions of old favourites with this one, swooping opening movement at once encompassing just about everything you possibly could to open a reboot dramatically. In essence, the whole thing's gone 'Bond/Batman' on us – the old crew are back for the first time since 1989, but the twist reads something like: most of the people playing them weren't even born at that time. This of course translates into the fact the crew of Kirk, Spock, etc. are in their youth and we follow their progress here from lowly kids on their respective planets to employees for the peaceful, respectful and reassuringly indomitable intergalactic organisation of StarFleet.That said, the film is almost frightened of formally taking on such an idea; the throwing in of a time travel-driven narrative calls to mind past ventures while a later scene actually dares to bring back one of the original crew in their older form. Likewise, and where people often cite Wrath of Khan as their favourite franchise instalment, this 2009 reboot dares to periodically invoke said film with its inclusion of mind slugs and that seemingly unbeatable examination we witnessed in 'Wrath's' opening. In spite of all its bravado and slick visuals telling a rip-roaring yarn featuring incarnations of people we're fond of, it is quite extraordinary just how ordinary the film actually is. In spite of everything that arrives with it, and in spite of the fact it's difficult to watch it without a smile on one's face at the best of times, the film is painfully commonplace as a standalone work of filmmaking. There is an unshakable feeling that narrative and conflict came second to the primary focus of rebooting, something inherent in the relatively weak narrative idea that this crew of people must merely set out to save the world.When we begin proper, we do so way-back-when: far back enough for James T. Kirk to be a youth rebellious enough and spiteful enough to wreck his step father's car in what is an intuitive, brave and blasé response to a set-up; situation or person that grinds him. As Kirk grows a little older, he begins to resemble Chris Pine, who does a fantastic job in capturing the later mannerisms of Kirk – that odd, twitchy way in which he seemed to suppress nerves through stares and a brisk, sharp series of statements that cut to the heart of the matter. His renegade attitude from infancy carries over into young adulthood, his aggression and enthusiasm eventually channelled into joining StarFleet where he swaps the farms of Iowa for warzones set in deep space. Because everyone in the crew is still young, and the film is ultimately aimed at people of similar age, we get scenes set in bars; scenes of people haring down the roads in their automobiles to loud rock music and fleeting compositions of girls in their underwear during this juvenalised segment.The villain is a Romulan named Nero, played by Eric Bana – but he makes for a poor antagonist: a snarling, skin-headed, heavily tattooed bad guy drawn from stock and going on to remind you of just how good he was in playing a character of similar visual proportions, although much more rounded, in 2000's 'Chopper'. Nero's unhappy at what happened to his planet far into the future, that is to say its complete destruction at the hands of the Vulcans and the Humans – travelling back in time, his plan is to destroy Vulcan and Earth instead of using this time travelling technology to save the planet or try for some sort of compromise is weak, and emphasises how the attention towards the general rebooting trumped anything else. When Kirk does eventually assume control of a ship for the first time, we take note of the meek substance surrounding his channelling of the grief born out of the death of his father at the hands of the Romulans, and how this differs to Nero's attitude to it all. Aside from this, Kirk himself is on a bit of a black list with the StarFleet higher-ups when we witness him cheat at that commandeering test – the film coming to resemble a proving of sorts that he can, in fact, handle himself. But this is a start, a kick-starting of a fresh series of films based further still on old ground; a series with a first film here I enjoyed enough to want more, old ground of which I do not know as much about the essence as many-a others likely do that I still relish in re-treading anyway. The film has its flaws, and cannot quite match the quality of some of the preceding entries, but it is almost certainly worth checking out.",6,2,2,11 April 2013
Fight Club," Stupefying beyond belief; Fight Club is a messy spectacle of ugliness, exposition and crass ideologies playing out under a broad banner of mainstream entertainment.
","I read that Fight Club is a 'man's film', whatever that means. Truth be told, it's a little boy's film, a messy; scrappy; clawing; pseudo-philosophical piece of turgid nonsense lapped up by people who see a music video aesthetic crossed with their favourite actors churned out of this contemporary Hollywood star system we have that just happens to dabble in some meek philosophy: bums and nobodies like the ones in the film will find its gimmicky pretences enthralling, appealing and quite interesting. For the rest of us, this is lecturing nonsense from a writer whom ought to have all his pens, pencils and word processors taken away from him. The film's entire thesis is captured in a sequence in which, at the fight club of the title, the store owner comes down into his own shop's basement to question what everyone's doing. After some grief from Durden, he beats him before eventually being subdued himself by a blood soaked Durden slobbering all over him. The owner runs off; suddenly attuned to allowing the club to remain and all he needed to arrive at this point is a good fight of some description. That's it; that's all you need to know right there – the rest is nonsense of the highest order.The film plays out under this facade of post-modern trickery and modern movie making gimmicks, thus rendering it 'accessible'; but the fact we're expected to swallow this infantile babble about how difficult it is to be a blank, bummed out nobody; a thug, a vandal, whose lives are in the dank state they are because they never found any particular field in which they could excel, is pathetic. The film was David Fincher's fourth, but he will not churn out a worser piece of cinematic drek in his life than the adolescent, preening nonsense that is Fight Club. The piece is essentially one long flashback and is narrated by Edward Norton's nameless character. When we first see him, he has a gun in his mouth and finds himself in an area chock full of explosives courtesy of Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Norton initially I.D's himself as a slave to consumerism; an unexciting office worker who comes to find solace in fighting and violence with other men in an organised fight ring from whence the title derives. But in Durden, a frightening character is created: a thug, a vandal, a terrorist but a role model; an individual whose manic hair style; cool looking shades; extravagant dress sense; sexual habits and natural charisma paints positive characteristics in an individual that ought to be anything but. Durden sees himself as a saviour; a liberator; an army general whom leads his troops and encourages them to break the shackles of life; someone whom frees and liberates via terror, as exemplified in a scene set in a convenience store car park in which he threatens to execute a young store worker if he doesn't return to education. All this leads to a sickening finale, an end that carries a highly romanticised, emotionally heavy sensibility about it as bombs go off and two people embrace.The film is from the pen of Jim Uhls by way of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the film is Palahniuk's inane babbling against the machine; his banal, inane ranting and raving of which the arguments in the film are put across by way of nothing more than childish expositional tidbits on behalf of Pitt's character: 'The things you own end up owning you' is a sample. In stark comparison to Norton's grey suit; blank shirt-clad and office booth based character, the one he shares most screen time with, Durden is a dangerously vibrant explosion of colour and energy. Later, there's a reason for all this hopping about in characteristics and mannerism as well as the restrictions in the Norton-Pitt interaction; but in itself, opens up a number of problems as to how they can be in separate places at once and how on Earth one person can know about one item (such as the whereabouts of the human fat) with the other seemingly oblivious to all links to it.Make no mistake, the film is the clawing ramblings of someone with some serious issues. In attempting to wage a war on consumerism, we get plenty in the way of product placement for companies such as Pepsi and Apple Macintosh; its approach sees a world initially filtered through the psyche of an insomniac in Norton's character, before support groups and false emotion helps cure that and a character named Marla (Carter) push it back to the forefront again. Is there a need for her character? Marla's presence opens up a sub-plot to do with her own problems of suicidal ideation and a fling she has with Durden which is entirely pointless. After a while, the film realises her presence is futile; that the piece is meant to be about the relationship of its two lead men, their masculinity and their relationship with other men, scrapping her for more inane tangents that run off on separate strands.The whole thing is as empty headed and crass as it sounds, this underground fight ring escalating from a celebration of pain, violence and all things grimy and nasty into a tale of a terrorist group full of 'misunderstood' philistine-infused males. In creating an ugly film about ugly people with ugly views, but filtering it by way of sporadic philosophy and sociology with an accessible aesthetic in its MTV-style appearance, Fincher has crafted a text he's most certainly above. It's nonsense of the worst kind; the sort of nonsense that has an eye on being labelled as something higher than first appears, addressing people in society doing what's deemed menial jobs before actually becoming someone in the ring during which battering and bruising someone else is the answer to life's problems. It's babble; babble of the most patronising and disorganised, sporadic order; a maddening and dulling faux-intellectual piece of nonsense.",4,2,6,7 May 2010
Citizen Kane," Its poster tells us 'Everybody's talking about it!' You know what? Everybody still is.
","Nothing that I, or anyone else, will ever say either here or anywhere else will ever change the immense aura Citizen Kane carries with it. Here is a film that has been voted number one of all time by the American Film Institute twice over a span of eleven years and has garnered copious amounts of praise from Sight and Sound's own decade-spaced lists. The sum of it all is; yes, the film is fascinating just as it is thoroughly engaging and brilliantly made. It's not because of the credentials that I give it a maximum rating, nor is it because it would be the 'easy' thing to do, it's purely because the film is genuinely one of my favourites on film making and historical grounds.Orson Welles knows what he's doing here, he's delivering a tale revolving around the image of one man from many others' perspectives. These people include his former second in command, his employees and at some points, one of his wives. But the brilliance is that Welles allows the audience to have the final say in what they think of this character, this character that Welles has quite deliberately cast as himself, with the most wonderful of twists at the very end rounding off the piece. Do we forgive him for what he was through no fault of his own when he was whisked away as a child? The ending doesn't exist as a cop-out to excuse his ruthless behaviour but only adds to the layers of study established beforehand.Citizen Kane is genuinely enthralling, a film that doesn't chart the rise and fall of a character but rather kills them off in the very first scene before allowing a central character, who's a reporter, to try and deconstruct the myth of such a wealthy and successful individual. 'Getting there' seems to come across as Citizen Kane's focus, but the burning question isn't how he made it, rather what he meant when he uttered the word 'Rosebud' on his death bed before smashing a snow globe, something that within that tiny dome lies the clue as to what he meant; but won't become immediately obvious until we have had Kane's childhood locales and surroundings established. As he gazed down at the small, snowy surroundings in the dome; it is a recollection of sorts of days and innocence gone by, something he was removed from rather than naturally moved away from.The film follows, in non-linear format as it shoots into the past at different spots in Kane's life, said reporter named Jerry Thompson (Alland) as he attempts to answer the question posed to him by other journalists following a newsreel presentation. Just what did he mean by his last word? Arguably, the most famous one worded quote in cinema's history. The introduction of Charles Kane himself is disorientating and fits unevenly with the rest of the film; a proud and booming newsreel detailing Kane's life in the media and politics before advancement into some sort of mental illness akin to hording. The question follows the footage and it is proposed that the myth surrounding Kane is deconstructed, immediately establishing the idea of how one person can come across as one thing through either the media or word of mouth whereas getting down to brass tacks with them opens up all sorts of alternatives.The first time we see Kane in 'real time' and indeed hear him speak, he cracks a joke and generally seems to have the audience on his side. This immediately goes against the prior opinion that he was a 'bad' man or a communist or a struggling individual. Kane seems charming, funny; even quite nice and from the newsreel to the real image Welles has firmly established it's about finding out the facts of the situation rather than settling with the fiction.Initially, the film centres on Kane's becoming of a newspaper mogul as he, Mr. Bernstein (Sloane) and Jedediah Leland (Cotten) look to buy out an existing paper firm in New York. They do so, and the expulsion of the 'old' as poor Mr. Carter is relieved of his duty and the introduction of the 'new' (complete with the 'best of' from rival newspapers) sees Welles establish his character as one who is going to take the reins and just plough on ahead as this new force to be reckoned with. With this, his ideas of 24/7 news and 'all of the news all of the time', reverberate with us due to the technological climate we live in now whereas in the film, others can only dismiss it as impossible. So while outlandish at the time, and we recognise that, we get a feel for what Kane's envisaging in that one exchange.As the film progresses, we observe Kane's subsequent divulge into politics and two failed marriages and the film takes a breather for Mr. Thompson, alá the audience, in the present time to ask further questions and really try to get under the skin of the situation. One of the film's more harrowing shots is Kane's reaction when an associate reads out the review his wife got at the previous night's opera as written by an employee. It's a progression of anger and confusion mixed with doubt as he wonders if it is jealousy, poor journalism or just the straight damn truth. Later, his wife will finish another performance and Kane attempts to cue a standing ovation, but he's lost his grip on the world and those around him – he no longer carries the influence he once had and consequently, every one remains silent. But it's really all just scratching the surface and the brilliance of the film cannot really be summed up here; just know that while easy to dislike through its reputation, is difficult to deny its intrigue once viewed.",10,2,6,25 February 2009
Monster," What if Thelma & Louise was based on a true story?
","Monster is a film about self discovery; it's about friendship and the gruelling reality of life and how it can hit those when they least expect it. Aileen (Theron) doesn't start out a serial killer in Monster but due to unforeseen events, sort of becomes one; Selby (Ricci) doesn't start out a girl in a large, wide world full of life experience but due to unforeseen events, you bet she is by the end of the film through realising food doesn't put itself on the table and money doesn't grow on trees and this forms the basis of the film Monster; a film directed by a woman, about women and about finding out who or what certain people really are.It's probably been noticed before I'm saying it here but Monster really reminded me of Ridley Scott's 1991 film Thelma & Louise; a film in itself an entertaining and unpredictable one about self discovery and 'dates with destiny'. One outlining problem I had with that film was its lack of commitment towards its content; it should have been a dark film revolving around dark matter but it remained light and upbeat thanks to the constant innocence of its leads and the friendly county music that popped up every now and again. In Monster, I have found the film I wanted Thelma & Louise to be  a darker tale about two women on the run.I would go so far as to say that Monster actually feels like a remake of Thelma & Louise. Firstly, you have the two leads who are complete binary opposites: Aileen is the lead, almost hard bodied, character who is a trickster, a liar and a prostitute whereas Selby is the angelic sidekick who lives at home and still has other kids as friends: there is also a sweet camera shot where Selby looks into a mirror and smiles at herself which although quick is by no means insignificant - if Selby is Thelma then Aileen is Louise. Secondly, it's Selby who runs away against her family's wish just as Thelma did in the other film but this time instead of running away from a domineering husband she is attempting to, perhaps wrongfully to some, escape her mother and father. Thirdly, the initial incident that sparks the film into life is an attempted rape on one of the girls; funnily enough it's the Aileen/Louise character and Aileen reacts in the exact same way Louise did. The difference here is that in Monster, she is actually raped whilst being bound in the car's front seat with the repercussions of her rape evident later on in the film when she showers but Thelma & Louise, being not as dark, was a lot more straightforward and a lot less bloodthirsty.Another thing that Monster does in a much more detailed and analytical manner is its study of the characters. Thelma and Louise were both relatively recognisable characters whom instead of starting out 'bad', merely progressed to that stage. We aren't told of Thelma's 'past incidents' but in Monster, we not only know what Aileen does but we get to see her do it, ie; being picked up at various points and discussing types of sex and costs. What disturbed me here and what made it clearly identifiable over Thelma & Louise was that Monster makes Aileen out to be rather masculine or at least gives her masculine traits. I already mentioned she is hard bodied but she is very unattractive, talks and acts like man and doesn't dress particularly glamorously  this twinned with the fact she is a lesbian means that she would go for girls if faced with the chance, something the male subconscious apparently thinks about every dozen seconds or so. There is also the matter relating to the cast on Selby's arm. Although seemingly random and insignificant; whenever the cast remains on, arguments and disagreements are never far away  to me, it felt like a part of home was still attached to Selby but what's interesting is that as soon as the cast comes off; Selby and Aileen have sex: she is now free and has 'cast off' any lingering feelings of doubt about the situation. No, it's not a coincidence her arm heals by the time Selby and Aileen reach that stage of their relationship.Amongst all the analysis of gender and comparisons to Thelma & Louise, Monster remains a dark and bleak film with a captivating story and two very, very fine pieces of acting. There is a definite atmosphere of chance; a hopeless feeling that eventually, everything will not be alright. The film's dark approach and dark subject matter is not tampered with like in Scott's 1991 road movie and it was pleasing to have such a film that didn't have many 'laughs' or secondary characters to sometimes cut to whenever the film felt like it. Monster is clever and interesting film-making that although relies on previous efforts, still manages to feel fresh.",8,0,1,19 November 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's supposed 'basterdisation' of World War II sees him zoom back to form with an enthralling; gut-wrenching and stylistic war-time thriller.
","Inglourious Basterds sees Tarantino 'glouriously' return to form. What was the debacle called Death Proof, one half of an 'experiment' entitled Grindhouse, has been tried; tested; acknowledged and now buried with Tarantino close to being back in top gear. The film is pure Tarantino, with the sorts of winks, nudges and acknowledgments that are subtle, and compliment the viewing experience, rather than bash you around the head by announcing the whole damn thing is a pastiche in the first place. We've returned to the sorts of Tarantino pieces that check progress with chapters; manipulate time; break the fourth wall; flashback; present us with interesting and dynamic characters that are brought to life brilliantly – even Tarantino's love for the female foot makes an amusing appearance when it transpires an entire plot point must revolve around a woman's foot/shoe. Yes, it's a mad, mad film; but it's as equally high in quality.Tarantino is still operating within that realm, or aesthetic, of escapism; and while his past, more better, work unfolded under a very grounded umbrella of realism and seemingly real-life people thinking, talking and interacting amongst a plateau of realistic, mostly unfortunate, situations; Inglourios Basterds tears The Second World War a new one with a series of scenes that rip up the rule book; re-envisage, and even have its characters outwardly speak of how certain others, inhabiting certain spaces, at certain times can be fate or 'just an amazing coincidence'. What we get is what Tarantino has confessed to being a Spaghetti Western that just happens to take place in France, in the 1940s, and with a bunch of colourful characters of whom some are French, German and British. The film even makes room for cameo appearances from some of the eras more famous faces and possesses the sheer confidence to spend a good ten or so minutes filling in detailed back-stories to characters before completely removing them from the text.The opening to the film is pure Tarantino; kicking things off in a lone, road side location as Christoph Waltz's Nazi colonel Hans Landa visits a French farmer. We are plunged into a game of fear, honour and suspicion. The scene is reminiscent of Jules' visit to the apartment full of young guys in Pulp Fiction, when retrieving a suitcase. The man is in total control; he requests a drink of milk more-so than Sprite and calmly banters with the hapless home-owner as he senses exactly what he's after is in very close proximity. His guards loom, ominously, just the other side of a muggy kitchen window out in the yard; out of focus but visible enough to tell us they're there and threatening. It is a brilliant start to what turns out to be an enjoyable romp; but never really exploitative of The Second World War. We do not enjoy any of the deaths in Inglourious Basterds; American, British, German, Jewish or otherwise. Nor are we excited by the shootouts, however well constructed they are.The Basterds of the title represent a group of American soldiers in Nazi-occupied France; flitting from German platoon-to-German platoon and injecting fear into the Nazi war-machine by killing, maiming, bashing and scalping the enemy. They're led by Brad Pitt's Aldo Raine, a mostly expressionless lieutenant, who self-confesses he and his men are in the 'Nazi killing business, and business is a-booming!' I was surprised by just how much Pitt's Raine was in it; that being not very much. All the build up, talk and promotional material seemed to include him or revolve around him and his Basterds of the title. Indeed, Tarantino spoke at length about how long it took him to write the character and how much he realised he needed Pitt in the role, etc. But Raine's there for a bit at the beginning, then for about fifteen at the end. It is in no way a criticism, merely an observation, but my guess is that the script was chopped so much that Raine became a supporting character around which Tarantino's finale (which he has stated he had great trouble coming up with over the years) was built up to; and that itself involved a whole new bunch of characters mingling in and around a plot involving raw film stock and a cinema.Along with these Basterds; of whom Tarantino might be drawing on real life parallels with current American soldiers-come-involvement in brutal, immoral activity in foreign wars; even if I respect those that would disagree through lack of development of this idea; we are presented with a young girl named Shosanna Dreyfus (Laurent), whose family are killed by Landa and who has retired to a Parisian cinema to wait out the war. That premise alone might inspire a dynamic, revenge-fuelled, cut and thrust adventure set amongst World War II; but instead, she gets a chance encounter with a young German soldier, who is involved in film production through various reasons. Dreyfus' transition under her alias of Emmanuelle Mimieux, as a submissive and quietly nervous in the Nazis' presence, to a laughing; cackling, rather frightening face that illuminates the setting of the finale is equally refreshing to watch; the final stages of the transition is best highlighted by a montage of fetishistic close ups as she dons clothes and make-up for the climax of a screening.The film is a sweeping display of tension, horror and distinct black comedy; forever flicking, effortlessly I might add, from the nastiness involved in the hatching of a dangerous plan between two lovers within the walls of a cinema; to an ever-diligent German officer attempting to piece everything together; right the way through to the ever-present, but relegated to looming in the background, group of Americans known as The Basterds. As a multi-equilibrium and frequently non-linear piece, complete with an array of influences and film references within itself, Inglourius Basters is, this time, a welcome addition to the Tarantino collection.",7,3,10,21 August 2009
Underworld," Vampires for the 21st Century, but there's not an awful lot going on here besides this.
","Underworld is the horror film for the YouTube generation. It presents two of Universal's many classical horror monsters from yester-decade and updates them for the contemporary age that is the 21st Century. Similary to the following year's Van Helsing and to quite some similar failings, Underworld presents vampires and werewolves, not as subjects of horror designed to frighten, but as action heroes fighting one another in a picture that is more akin to a war film than it is most anything else. The hybridity of the genres and general updating does not stop there, for at its centre is a strong female hero, a bringing into the 21st century for both species and an essence of noir for good measure.The most interesting thing about Underworld is its study of post-modern (indeed, post-classical) vampires and how now, they are all techno-literate beings whom dress in the latest fashion and carry on with a certain legacy of looking smart and always trying to remain one-up on their enemies. While all around contemporary Hollywood over the last few years, different directors explore their chosen 'types' of vampires, Len Wiseman purely updates and shifts into the 21st Century. Some examples I'm thinking of are Robert Rodriguez' Hispanic vampires in From Dusk Till Dawn; the African-American half-vampire lead in the Blade films and a more obscure example in 2001 film The Forsaken, in which you had to believe a group of relatively harmless looking bunch of teen vampires were on the brink of world domination. These ideas have continued on with films like Twilight, which places a romantic spin on the character.Wiseman has taken what it was for a character to be a vampire and has purely transformed them for now: cloaks into PVC, Gothic bookcases and books into laptops and computers and has gifted them with an array of firearms. On the other hand, the werewolves or 'lycans' in this film are grotty and dirty. They inhabit grungy and filthy locations and seem to have none of the advanced ways of living their counterparts have, if the vampires are sexy then the Lycans are just plain ugly. They are additionally evil and sadistic in their procedures, taking blood from people that really don't want to be there.Underworld takes place in an odd Eastern European/United States hybrid of a location and sees its female lead, named Selene (Beckinsale), go through a number of motions before she comes across a certain human named Michael Corvin (Speedman), someone whom the Lycans have targeted as part of their plans. Following Michael being bitten and Selene's determination to save him, a love story begins to bloom. The love story between two rivalling factions makes me think of Romeo and Juliet, but in another one of Wiseman's twisting of classical conventions, one agent of the party is a member of the 'enemy' against his will.Alas, all the glory within this film lies in its ideas and its here we remember that the film is a bit of a dead zone, offering murky and somewhat camp entertainment (especially when Bill Nighy turns up) at the best of times. Wiseman has a strong, female lead at the centre of his film but the director conflicts his interests in the shooting of her, that being he does so in a manner in which she's rendered an object. Underworld begins in a relatively ominous fashion with the set up to do with the Lycans trying to find a descendant of a certain someone and the fact they've developed a weapon that can kill vampires a lot more efficiently than anything else that has previously been produced.The film is quite good fun for about thirty-five minutes, then the charm wears off; then we recognise the all updating of the vampire conventions, etc. and get tired of it; and then it just descends into nothing before it ends. What was quite good very quickly becomes ugly looking characters standing around explaining the plot to one another when they aren't merely grumbling their lines amidst bleak and tired looking locations. The vampires spend their spare time shooting statues in the large, Gothic manor house they inhabit purely for target practise but what happens when they decapitate all their statues? They look stern and talk in gruff and ominous tones as their leader, Viktor (Nighy), who is awoken for certain reasons, slobbers and cackles all over the place in a role that on another day you might think was a pantomime performance.What about the Lycans? Well, one Lycan towards the end can seemingly turn into a werewolf and back again at will, despite there not being any obvious evidence of a full moon and whenever they do come up against someone they don't like, they maul them in a series of close up shots of blood, biting and shards being extracted from bodies that are just grotesque and feel oddly out of place in what is a casual, '15' certificate, gloomy period drama for most of the time. I read that Wiseman did a lot of concept art and drawing for the film – it shows. What also shows is his lack of attention to everything else. He's caught the 'look' of the vampires and the cinematography is relatively good but the film's running on empty. It makes me think: what else can a film about warring vampires and werewolves be about? Well, probably not much which further begs the question 'why even bother in the first place.'",5,0,2,28 March 2009
Amistad," Spielberg needs the events to have previously happened to avoid it being too much of a blockbuster but for what it is, Amistad is still pretty good.
","It's difficult to consider Steven Spielberg and out and out director in the sense he aims to entertain more so than he does inform, educate or combine his own vision(s) with films that revolve around themes and issues. I consider Spielberg an entertainer more so than I do a filmmaker, what else can you do with the man who, in Jaws, invented 'the blockbuster' and, in Star Wars and Indiana Jones, helped pioneer 'the franchise'? In Amistad, there is a film that revolves around several things at once: yes, it's clearly political but part of the problem is that it's so obviously so. Yes, it's an American period piece that needs help from incorporating many other nations from the era to create a story and yes, it does threaten to slip in and out of other genres too often.But this is Spielberg as a filmmaker. His speciality is to deliver a smash-bang experience and in Amistad he does so while touching on certain subjects of ownership, human rights and political tensions but these come across in individual scenes or moments that impacted on me less-so because of the 'should-be-there' themes and more-so because they were sudden and perhaps out of place. It is easy to stun an audience; Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is a good example with the shower scene in particular: it's a film in 1960; a woman showers; someone comes in and suddenly we are bombarded with a scenario that jolts us. Amistad is like this with scenes of slaves in boat holds being fed and unneeded slaves being thrown over-board, only the film as a whole does not build or 'carry on' from these scenes like Psycho did with the shower scene, but merely uses them as shock tactics to evoke an emotional reaction (which they do) and to get us to feel more empathy for the slaves on trial.So if Spielberg is more-so an entertainer, it would seem only natural for a Spielberg film to cover a vast array of genres or to cover a lot of ground in an epic tale of this and that. That said Amistad is a period piece; a courtroom drama; an historical tale; a biopic of some sorts; at times, a comedy and also a film that threatens to break out into the war genre when so many nations disagree and argue over what's right and wrong. Amistad is a film that does not do too many different nations too many favours. Most of the Americans in the film are kind and understanding but the slaves are presented as remaining hostile, as seen when during a hostile handshake and the shouting at another character through a courtroom window. But Spielberg doesn't have to take sides because this is based on true events so when the American high court judge is replaced, we see them to be presented as perhaps cheating and somewhat conniving, it shows Spielberg is not afraid of including details of that nature that do not flatter the government of the United States.But then again the lead defendant is American and the reminder of America's victory over the British is accompanied with plenty of flag waving throughout. Also, the Spanish queen Isabella II, played by Anna Paquin, is shown in a less than flattering light although the feeling of immaturity and juxtaposition of situations between these slaves on trial facing death and young royalty in a far off nation with everything available to her works rather well. Then there is the clever inclusion or mentioning at least of Sierra Leone's capital named 'Freetown' and how the British renamed it so thus stopping incidences like the one that transpires in this film from ever happening.But there are lots of basic things to be had out of Amistad, be it through the cast of specific actors and acting performances or whatever. For me, it was an interesting journey more than anything, through an historical subject (ie; the slave trade) that I do not know too much about. The film's premise is overshadowed by its actual unfolding of ideas and general plot, with the film playing an ace it establishes it has very early on and that is the power and knowledge of Anthony Hopkins' character named John Quincy Adams. Towards the end, the film is in search for a plot point and whilst the 'getting there' is eerie as well as horrific whenever told through the eyes of Cinque (Hounsou) in flashback mode, Adams' re-emergence and long, courtroom finale feels just as forced as it does uplifting.If there's anything to get out of the film, it is the brutal establishment of a situation that could've escalated into something really disastrous; a series of scenes that disregard human life in a nasty manner; an intriguing and thought provoking court battle and a finale that wants to be reminiscent of 1991's JFK but doesn't quite make it. Amistad is brutal in some scenes, threatens unnecessarily to be humorous in others but maintains a balanced and interesting air throughout.",7,2,5,13 July 2008
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Unremarkable action-laden sci-fi adventure, which does little but bridge a gap.
","Well, at least we now know how THAT happened... I'm not sure what it means when all you can illicit after a film like 'Star Wars: Rogue One' has come to its crashing, thrashing, resounding finale, is a shrug - a frown and a meekly appreciative nod of the head at how far special effects have come along, but it can't be good. Look, I don't necessarily dislike 'Star Wars'; I just came to it too late on in life to be able to adore it. But is a film which bridges the gap between the events of the first trilogy and the second of the famous filmic brand really what the die-hards wanted? If what transpires therein 'Rogue One' was any other science-fiction war drama, would we really be all that interested?It strikes me that the mind behind Star Wars, George Lucas, did neither himself nor the name of Star Wars many favours when he decided to sell it on to the Disney corporation, a brand name more synonymous with child's films, or at the very least entertainment for children. That is not to say that all of Disney's output has necessarily been made for the youngest among us, but there is something inherently childish about 'Rogue One' - it is a film for people who like noise and colour; its nucleus of heroes battling villains (toward an outcome we already know) is strikingly simplistic. By the end, I was struck by just how uncomplicated it all was.Gareth Edwards' effort here is, as stated, the conduit connecting the first three episodes to the latter three - that seemingly dead filmic space between the coming of Darth Vader and the evil empire he seeks to use to command the galaxy, and the plans of a weapon of mass destruction being stolen from one of said empire's bases. I cannot say that said dead-space, never mind the events that transpired therein, especially captured my imagination having actually seen all six episodes, but I cannot speak for other people - one assumes they are not the same as those who were desperate to learn about what Hans Solo was like as a younger smuggler, or what the origin-story of Vader himself was.Principally, there is a thematic in 'Rogue One' somewhere about morality and good vs. evil. It is epitomised in two characters whom both work for Vader's Empire: Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen), a technician who has first developed the Death Star and then gone on to develop second thoughts, and Ben Mendelsohn's Orson Krennic, who works with Vader and is very much in love with the idea of a WMD. Anyone who has seen Mendelsohn's work in other films, particularly his native Australian ones, will know that he is probably one of the best actors working today, but is wasted here in being asked to snarl into the camera and pull exasperated expressions. Galen should be, and I suspect probably was in an earlier draft, the film's protagonist with Krennic the principal villain. This, I would surmise, was changed at some point to encompass Felicity Jones, who plays Mikkelsen's daughter Jyn Erso, as the lead - a move which was probably supposed to have an eye on feminism or diversity or something, but actually hurts the project.As 'Rogue One' rolls on, you can see what the initial, more interesting film, might have resembled: two men working for the same organisation seeing things from different sides; both working to thwart the other and building to a climax whereby these ideas blossom into a tense finale atop a skywalk, as all-out war unfolds around them. This is not the film we are presented with, but we get something instead with enough going on to engage us - the being taken to new worlds; the thrill of a pursuit; the quirky supporting acts which bump us along the road - commendation is in order for Edwards for refusing to pepper the opening acts with differing robots; aliens and other idiosyncratic creatures for sake of selling them on the shelves of toy stores.Jones, as a young girl, is hiding on her parents' farm when Krennic comes calling for her father so that he may finish the Death Star. His refusal causes a tiff, a tiff from which Jones escapes into the world of underground resistance led by the eccentric Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker), whose mob is far from wholesome, and we appreciate how the film is trying to paint good in characters associated with the dark and bad in those synonymous with the alliance. Again, these ideas seem left over from a different, better, project and eventually come to nothing. Eventually, Jones takes it on to seek the Death Star's weak spot her father purposely created by way of the plans hidden in the depths of an enemy base. Tossed into the mix is a defecting Empirical fighter-pilot played by Riz Ahmed, which is an interesting idea, but we had seen this line of attack executed more efficiently the previous year with the John Boyega character in 'Force Awakens'.For almost its entire runtime, 'Rogue One' consists of hits and misses until its head-banging climax: the Death Star, when we see it, and despite knowing exactly what it's capable of, still manages to awe us when it gets going, which is good. One particular character, an ally, is a blind Chinaman whose forté is that he is good at marital arts and spouts Eastern philosophical tidbits, which is bad. Ultimately, Rogue One is an expensive diversion; a project Lucas probably wishes he himself had thought of when he had the rights to this pandemonium; an answer to that annoying question fans and whoever else like to ask pertaining to the Death Star's weak spot and how someone could be so stupid as to put it there in the first place. Well, after much thrashing about, that has now been buried. Congratulations...",6,0,0,22 May 2020

Dawn of the Dead," It's better than the original because it's faster, better paced and doesn't have any 'consumer society' nonsense in it.
","It's a reworking of a 1970s, George A. Romero cult classic and its premise is a load of people in a mall with zombies trying to get them: sounds like a recipe for disaster, right? Wrong because Dawn of the Dead (2004) is anything but.I think I was one of the few people who liked this film so much, it actually made me want to dislike the original even more. I'd seen the 1978 version twice before this one and now I've seen this one twice, I can safely say that it is better. Romero's original is sort of weak and how it managed to gain its cult status is a little beyond me. Its premise of: 'stuck in a mall with zombies all around you  what do you do?' still works in this version but Romero's sloppy direction, sloppy editing, poor script and lack of a star cast to give it good acting are four reasons why I didn't take to it. Maybe people like it in the same vein people like 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' (1959) but are too fickle to admit that Dawn of the Dead is a cult film because it's so bad.This reboot rights some wrongs and at the same time tells a story in a quick, pleasing, bloody and suspenseful way which makes it so enjoyable. The set up is focuses on speed more than anything as ignoring some plot details yet adding in a few of its own. We don't know where the disease that turns people into zombies comes from and we don't really know an awful lot about Ana (Polley) our protagonist apart from the fact she's a nurse and has maybe a husband or boyfriend that is removed almost as quickly as he is introduced. In fact, the film is so fast in its set up that the little girl that Ana has two confrontations with (the first being outside and all friendly, the second being quite the opposite) I mistook as her daughter.What Dawn of the Dead does that keeps it eerie and entertaining is that it mixes up several elements to keep it going. We are given the customary group of survivors of different ethnical race, age and social background and then given some more when they get to the mall in the form of security guards and then some more the next day in the form of even more survivors who have made their way to the mall. All these people add up to good zombie fodder for when the time comes but Dawn of the Dead doesn't just do it in an immature and guilty way because it retains sensibility of its situation and incorporates well set up and suspenseful action scenes as well as including gore, humour, action and feint romance whenever necessary. Not only does it get the basics right but it spaces them nicely. We never get overloaded with gore or manic gunfire; we are also spared the numerous shots of zombies on the outside looking in through windows or extensive shots of shop fronts as zombies trudge past them like we weren't spared in the original. The reboot also adds in running zombies and even child zombies which act as an interesting spin on zombies on a whole (the running part obviously inspired by 28 Days Later).Whatever faults the film does have often are there to invoke tension or push forward the plot. No, I don't think the dog could have been that intelligent and yes, I feel the zombies would've gone for it  no, I couldn't believe the intelligence of Nicole when she puts herself at unbelievable risk just to save the dog and I was also confused over the fact Ana shows no emotion or sadness towards her partner from the first ten minutes.I feel the running zombies are not just mere copies from 28 Days Later but signify a deeper meaning: where the 1978 version of this film's zombies trudge and moan  this version's run and scream. The remake, just like its zombies; is faster, louder and better.",8,2,4,2 September 2007
Alien: Resurrection," Seems ironic now that a film with the word 'resurrection' in the title would ultimately kill off a series, but this Alien film does not deserve the reputation it carries.
","I don't think it's that Alien: Resurrection is a bad film, just a film that pales in comparison when it comes to the mainstream's opinion of films that preceded it. But what films to have precede it; Ridley Scott's brilliant Alien, a film that helped pioneer that formula of the human, non-human and the anti-human archetype within a certain space together as events played out, more often than not the anti-human element 'jumping' out at you and picking off the hapless character. What happened in Aliens made everybody gush, some even more than Scott's effort and what happened in Alien³ largely has everybody point fingers at the studio simply because it's a David Fincher film and he directed Fight Club and that's 'brilliant' thus; he cannot make a bad film which means it was the studio's fault.But biased opinions on directors, films and studios aside; Alien: Resurrection is a sort of hybrid of all three of the films, more so the first two than the third alone. As a film of the genre, it's relatively well paced with a host of characters that threaten to break into the anti-hero vein but all of whom are given their fair share of screen time and all of whom have their traits and quirks. This is a far cry from Cameron's Aliens, which is the worst of the quadrilogy in my opinion, which had a series of soldiers or space Marines or whatever all wear the same uniform, speak and act in the same manner and generally shoot and scream and panic their way out of obligatory action set pieces that would come along every so often.If Alien was a science fiction that fell into the horror subgenre, Aliens was a science fiction that fell into the war subgenre. Alien: Resurrection is a science fiction film that just teeters over into horror meaning its core is taken from Scott's film although it has the elements of war from the second instalment although we never feel the group of protagonists are fit or equipped enough to take on the group of Aliens because of lack of firepower. The film isn't as good as the first one but then again, given the set up Alien had let loose to filmmakers after its release, no film that had been made in the genre by this time was as good.Alien: Resurrection sees a band of space travellers land at the ship hosting events in this edition. Their timing of arrival co-insides with Alien series veteran Ripley (Weaver) getting cloned for the purpose of extracting the Alien queen inside of her by the nasty, greed driven guys in surgical suits. Little does everyone know, the ship is an experimentation lab of horror and soon their own fates will be rendered ambiguous when some of the Aliens break out. The set up sounds similar to the following year's Deep Rising, itself a film about a group of 'bad' people who hijack a large mode of transportation, that time it was a cruise liner on the open sea, just as the anti-human element of the piece decides to strike. Rest assured, it's a lot better than Deep Rising.So the set up is one thing but the real meat of the film sees these rouge space travellers, of whom include Ron Perlman's Johner and Winona Ryder's Annalee Call as well as heroine of the hour Ripley fight and fend their way off the ship to safety. This is where it could be argued the film slips into 'Aliens' territory in the sense it's a bunch of characters on a ship, with guns, trying to get the hell out of there. So the question is, what's wrong with that? It's not as if the films descends into out and out chaos complete with choppy editing and dodgy one-liners, more so a more calm and drawn out exercise in travelling to a certain location and weathering the storm. The group must deal with underwater travel, the problem in dealing with a character in a wheelchair and how all these elements might affect them.But it's the character of Annalee Call that garners most of the attention, not least for the twist that arises to do with her. As a character, she is the voice of reason; she is the audience within the film, stating things and saying things aloud we might say or questions we might ask. At one point she stops Ripley from killing one of the ship's lab technicians after the grizzly hybrid findings in the laboratory; instead, she beat the official following Annalee's interruption and the audience perhaps feels relieved there is no blood shed between humans within the human prism of the human-nonhuman-antihuman triangle. Similarly, when it arises the ship automatically negates itself back to planet Earth following a revelation Annalee is there to once again announce, out loud that 'we should blow the ship up.' There's a beat between her (and us) hearing this information before her reacting during which time some audiences members might have already come to the conclusion she announces out loud.So while the film isn't brilliant, it is far from the disaster its reputation embeds it with. The film is a little bit of the previous three moulded into one but with a European director at the helm stamping his own mark on proceedings and allowing new ideas such as the hybrid monster at the end to step up. With hindsight, it's a far cry better than the path the producers took the franchise down most recently; that being Alien vs. Predator and more-so its respective sequel.",5,3,4,22 October 2008
Alien: Resurrection," Some interesting ideas, but falls short in too many departments too often to work
","The annoying thing about 'Alien: Resurrection' is that it is primarily an action film that comes with the odd scare, rather than an actual horror film which happens to include the odd second-unit set piece. It is additionally lacking in that atmosphere most science fiction films have when they place characters far off into the future or depict events on other planets or in the vast chasm of space. Things here feel more synthetic than the other films, and it makes you appreciate even more what Cameron did in the first sequel when he managed to keep 'Aliens' genuinely frightening in spite of the heavy artillery its characters had access to.'Resurrection' unfolds on a heavily guarded space station, a few hours from Earth, in the distant realms of the 23rd century. After the moaning and wailing which greeted the aftermath of the killing off of three beloved characters at the beginning of 'Alien3', 'Resurrection' rather curiously opens with the bringing of another one back to life. Look away now if you haven't seen 'Alien3', but following the death, nay evisceration, of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, scientists, in a film shot the year of the cloning of Dolly the sheep no less, have managed to recreate her as she was just prior to her decision to extradite herself from this mortal realm. The decision behind this is/was born out of the fact she possessed inside of her a young alien queen, likely the only one in left in existence, at the time of her plunge, which is a shifty organisation's only means of obtaining the spawn of this queen - the likes of which they require for their own ends.The base soon welcomes a motley space-crew who are delivering people in hyper-sleep to the scientists and military personnel while Ripley undergoes the death-roes of her treatment. The gang offer somewhat fertile ground for characterisation - the captain and pilot are in a relationship; Ron Perlman plays the rugged equivalent of a twenty-third century seadog; there's a mechanic in a wheelchair (but wouldn't robotic technology enabling him to walk exist by now?) and a young angelic looking woman named Call (Winona Ryder) who holds her own in the rough, working-man dominated space. Frustratingly, few get beyond a perimeter of stock status.What is additionally curious is that Ripley is not the protagonist per se in this edition; her mannerisms and behaviour, whilst executed flawlessly by Weaver herself who must play someone who is neither human nor animal and, on top of that, artificially created in the first place, are cold; detached and strangely invulnerable - she is not the Ripley of the franchise prior to now and this sits a little uncomfortably. The film, in fact, lacks any kind of presence of a hero around which we might revolve our interest. Much time is spent in the opening act on characters that are removed within minutes of the second, while Weaver plays someone whose arc has already been completed in the other three films when she played out some interesting dynamics with the alien creatures to do with motherhood and fostering children.The Queen they get out of Ripley does what they want and the staff get their aliens on cue, only to see them escape, of course, and wreak havoc on the spaceship, all around the time the transporters come to blows with the marines on board when Call, the one we thought least likely of the crew to start trouble, breaks house rules. Confusingly, the vast army of soldiers already on board abandon the ship at the first sign of a problem, thus calling into question as to what their purpose was in the first place in case of an emergency, and the film beds down into a nice, comfortable groove of depicting an array of people, military personnel included, striving to get to the remaining route off the ship, which is the craft the mercenaries arrived in, which of course is miles away from where anyone begins.I suppose there is an air of unpredictability in who will live and who will die, but this doesn't compensate for much when we realise how poor characterisation has been to this point. To everyone's horror, the mother ship's programming has automatically kicked in, meaning it is in the process of returning to Earth - an odd contingency if you know what you're dealing with on board is as dangerous as it was. There is much talk on concepts of universal brotherhood and sticking together from one character among the band of survivors, but as soon as they realise Earth is the ship's destination and that these animals will probably ravage the planet, making a dangerous detour to try and stop it seems unappealing. Where else did they expect to be able to go if not Earth?'Resurrection' falls rather a long way short in the pacing and atmosphere stakes - it unfolds on a ship too close to Earth in the first place for it to feel like we're lost in the barren wildernesses of outer space, unlike 'Alien', and where in Ridley Scott's film the characters had to make up a course of action as they went along as they faced their situation, they plod their way to a fixed destination in this entry, knowing full well a sort of reprieve awaits them when they arrive. What was additionally lost on me was the film's commentary - does it disapprove of the science behind cloning? Is toying with genetics a bad thing? That cross-breeding is a dangerous game? Long after you realise the new addition to the franchise, a giant white mutant, can understand English, it will probably be lost on you too.",5,1,2,24 January 2020
The Hunger Games," Workable action film, which burns its way to some involving content involving characters we like and social commentary
","What I admired most about 'The Hunger Games' was how it managed to resist the temptation to leap into the second unit material straight away - a misstep so many films of this genre, especially those geared towards the same demographics as this one is, have done so. Instead, 'The Hunger Games' earns the right to 'go there', so to speak - taking its time to establish character and situation. What I also appreciated was its subtext to do with violence and entertainment; de-sensitisation and trivialisation, and more broadly how governments are able to utilise such things to control populations. Jennifer Lawrence plays the rather conspicuously named Katniss Everdeen, a young woman living somewhere in a North America which has gone to the dogs through war and now suffers life under a totalitarian regime in the far-future. Where she lives, the equally conspicuously named Panem, possesses in its constitution a highly questionable law which dictates that, every year, one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 19 from each of the country's dozen or so districts must face off to the bloody death in a large gamezone carved out of the forests in what are the eponymous 'hunger games'. The reasons for this brutal regulation pertain to the dictatorial government wanting to keep up the traditions of honour and willpower synonymous with its national identity, but these days everybody largely agrees it is down to the sheer fact that said contest makes for damn good television. Questions pertaining to how old the nation is and what they did before television was invented are not answered... As a character, Everdeen is nobody special - nobody in Panem is, because the grip the rulers have on the country keeps anybody from broadening out too far into becoming anything at all. She maintains her friendships; lives in her rudimentary village; takes care of her younger sister and spends enough time fooling around with a bow and arrow to become a bit of a crack-shot. Will the skill come to benefit her later on in the tale? Disaster strikes when, through reasons I will leave unspoilt, Everdeen winds up appearing in the yearly contest having been selected as the female to represent her district. This plunges Lawrence's character into a whole new world of colour; energy and fame, not to mention life-threatening danger on account of having to do battle with a motley group of compatriots from the other districts which range from robust, muscular black males on the very brink of being too old to compete to mousey younger girls too young to possess any real clue as to what is even happening. 'The Hunger Games' is not an especially exhilarating character piece, but it does do the basics required of both the action and horror (and, in part, romance) genres especially well. The film is an energetic post-modern fusion of all sorts of things ranging from 'Predator' to 'TRON' by way of the 2000 Japanese film, to which it seems to owe its greatest debt, 'Battle Royale'. It allows its premise and the sheer scope afforded to it in terms of whatever content it might possess to make a scathing attack on modern American (even Western) free-market consumer entertainment. This is unsubtly presented to us for the first time quite early on when one character quips about the contest that '...if no one watched (on TV), they (the government) wouldn't do it', eventually becoming a film depicting a society with a violent, deranged spectacle at the very core of its identity. Indeed, while nothing in the world (that we know of) can quite match the barbarity of what Gary Ross' film depicts here, we should be aware by now that WWE is adored by millions; heavyweight championship boxing matches can make billionaires out of its participants in one evening and that some of the highest grossing films of all time are action (or violence) packed blockbusters. This begs the question: how do WE - the film-going audience - react to the violent action when it finally starts? Are we entertained? Do we fall into the trap of rooting for a character because we want them to succeed? Is it not too often the case that the target audience for the film roll from multiplex screening to multiplex screening absorbing the latest actioner? By the time the 'Games' themselves have begun, the film has earned the right to take us to where we go. To complain that they are episodic, and that the set-pieces & killings might happen in any order, seems silly, but the best action films have always had a sense of grace and timing to their second unit sequences as events unfold around their characters: 'Terminator2' and 'Jurassic Park' might be two good examples from recent history. The screenplay possesses very little of any terrific profundity, while the lead's taking in under her wing of a fellow female contestant far too young to survive on her own merely proves what we already knew: she is a good older sister - a more affecting arc may have been to establish her earlier as a bully to her sibling and have her return much kinder. Irrespective, there is enough in 'The Hunger Games' to get stuck into and enjoy.",6,0,0,5 January 2018
The 13th Warrior," Rambo with swords and shields but even that is too much of a compliment.
","When adventure films are good, that usually means they are fun. Indiana Jones and The Mummy are good examples of adventure films from recent times that have withstood the short test of contemporary time. Action films cannot help but impose upon additions to the genre; but when you see a bad adventure film, you know it's bad when the narrative is dull and routine; when the action scenes are short and unspectacular and when certain events that occur happen because the genre demands they happen, rather than because the film is trying something new and original.In The Mummy, from the same year; there were these ancient Egyptian beetles that were reminiscent of piranhas only they weren't constricted to water; in the Indiana Jones films, we were given good, constructive bad guys who we enjoyed seeing get pummelled and beaten by the hero; we like the special effects in both films, the characters and the beauty of the locales. In The 13th Warrior, surely the now obvious 'beginning of the end' for director John McTiernan, we are given grubby looking cinematography set amongst a backdrop of boring and uninspiring settings; we are presented with action scenes so dull and unimpressive we actually feel cheated; we are presented with some of the most boring, one-dimensional characters ever committed to an action film and we are insulted with a narrative so plain and so uninteresting that to even repeat it would waste time and insult intelligence.That is to say the actual narrative for The 13th Warrior is just bland and routine. Antonio Banderas plays an Arab with a Spanish accent among a group of Vikings who are portrayed in an equally insulting light. Banderas' character's name is even so long and such a mouthful that it too could be seen as insulting toward the typical Arabic name, in fact it's so long one could assume the writers were playing for laughs more than anything else. Action heroes need a short and sharp name, something cool and sharp to reflect their persona: Han Solo, James Bond, Indiana Jones; hell, even Rick O'Donnell would do but we are given 'Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad'? It's no wonder the Vikings laugh at him as we are doing the same. After a very young boy travels the length and breath of the land (the length it takes to learn a new language), seemingly on his own, to deliver a mere message that they are under attack from 'monsters', twelve Vikings take it upon themselves to travel and help out but with one catch: the 13th warrior must be foreign. If you can get past the fact this little ancient 'rule' still seems like a necessity to be included in a time of crisis, then you might miss how very handy it is that Ahmed was even there; otherwise who else was going to go? Omar Sharif's character? I'd like to have seen that.Ahmed goes on a journey with these Vikings whom are portrayed as big, disgusting troll like people who wash themselves in each others spit and happily kill one another over the last piece of drumstick at meal times. Likewise, the Arabs seem to have a certain class; a certain sort of swagger that can only be put down to Hispanic Banderas' good looks and Spanish elegance. In the film, Banderas has another opportunity to swish and sway enemies with his sword, just as he did in The Mask of Zorro a mere twelve months earlier. But this time, there is no class nor is there the feeling of adventure or excitement; unlike that film, The 13th Warrior heads nowhere bar an abyss of horrible action set pieces and boring logic. The 'monsters' of the piece turn out to be nothing more than bears with swords and shields, how dull and that's when we're supposed to truly believe that they're monsters. What Banderas discovers that no one else for the hundreds of years that they've been attacking the Viking villages is that these monsters are actually men, black men; in costume. Yes, racism starts to run a little thick and a little fast here. Boring, faceless, seemingly voodoo obsessed black people who are able to not only control the weather but live in an underground system of caves and such, during which they can survive and develop utopias of rope bridges and democratic systems that govern who are the fighters and who are the leaders: they are like human ants who every now and again, like to pop up to the surface and start a bit of bother. Their 'kind' have been doing this for centuries, might I add.And then the genre movie kicks in. The Vikings and Ahmed lie in a circle as the monsters approach but nobody decided to give Ahmed any training with the Viking sword that he clearly cannot use but that's only established AFTER the first fight scene. He says so himself he is no warrior but he drops a few of these monsters no problem. The fights are frequent, dark and unintelligible when they're at their most mediocre. The film descends into a Warcraft style narrative when the characters have to visit some crazy old woman who speaks more sense than she looks like she's able to: 'Kill the leader!' she exclaims. Yup, that might work. After seeing off hoards of the monsters who were armed with torches and swords and whom could so easily have taken the allied camp in one swoop if they really tried to, the Vikings and Ahmed make a counteroffensive into the lair; something nobody thought of in centuries gone by. A final word on the closing battle scene: absolute crap. A three minute montage of swishing swords and funny faces in slow motion and it's over, as is very briefly after the immediate ending, the audience's will to live.",4,1,4,22 January 2008
Shaun of the Dead," Convincing British effort, which is so much more than mere pastiche as it integrates class comedy and character study-alike rather well.
","Filmmakers and writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, in tandem, prove they're more than adept at producing a high on energy levels; high on laughs comedy material in their 2004 film Shaun of the Dead. Their film is a big on fun, big on smarts comedy-romance piece about a clash of classes and a man going through somewhat of a midlife crisis just as the end of the world, in the form of the dead coming back to life so as to feed on the living, arrives into the world. The film is a merciless series of rapid punchlines and in-jokes, entertaining and effective in equal measure without ever feigning to be anything more; a piece made by two people whom have here shown they have the comic timing and the subtly required to take on the kind of material they do. Take, for instance, the scene in which certain characters are trapped inside a locked car because the rear door child-locks are on. It was established five minutes ago that they were on, but such a gag works thanks largely to Wright and Pegg's ability to introduce something; place it on the back-burner and then execute the joke when required to around all the other stuff in the form of character, more immediate gags that are going on and great peril which is unfolding.One casts one's mind back to David Zucker's 2003 film My Boss's Daughter; a comedy free freak show whose comic timing awkwardly consisted of someone, in Ashthon Kutcher, inept and cack-handed placed in the delicate situation of looking after a pristine home and charged with looking after the pride and joy of its owner in the form of a pet owl. The sounds of the gears of an automobile being incorrectly changed as it approaches a speed began to sound pretty early on, sure enough, everything goes down the pan in an as limp manner as possible in what was an excruciating feature. The team on Shaun of the Dead set a joke up; mix it in with a couple of others; have you momentarily misplace it before effortlessly executing the punch-line minutes later amidst everything else that's happening. In comparison, it is a bravado display of both comic timing on top of entertaining material. Another example might be the anger levels reached by one character, whose berating at others stems from the fact the front door is persistently being left open overnight; the gag of which is set up, placed on a back-burner and then pulled off with aplomb when the time comes.It is Simon Pegg playing the titular Shaun, a man in his late twenties working in a high-street electronics store whilst supervising the more younger employees. He lives with part-time drug dealer but the generally unemployed Ed (Frost) and whom we're led to believe is a high-flying businessman in Pete (Serafinowicz), both of whom Shaun have known for many years. Shaun's relationship with Liz (Ashfield) is on the rocks, they sit in a public house named The Winchester with some of her friends and discuss where they stand. The pair of them clash in profile, Ed's more centralised figure as he works a slot machine and spouts one-liners distracting us from what Liz has to say. She wants more out of life and wants a better relationship with Shaun in which they do more together rather than just go to the pub. The parallel between their disfigured connection to that of David (Moran) and Dianne's (Davis), Liz's friends, relationship is clear in that their's is sturdier and have interests of a 'higher' nature such as the going to theatres. This is precisely where Liz wishes to be, in terms of status, with Shaun. The earlier clash in profile has David and Dianne sit on Liz's side, effectively a clashing of classes, as Shaun's accomplice Ed comes over and alienates everybody with his demeanour.Shaun and Ed appear so tuned out of their lives that they appear to have missed the apocalypse. Two sequences that mirror one another show Shaun, in one long tracking shot, walking from his home; down the street and into a local shop before coming back again. The items of a kid playing football; a local washing his car and those in and around a local corner shop reoccur in both sequences, the first time Shaun ventures there everything appearing rosy and functioning in a supposedly Utopian world of the working class and of terrace housing. Later on, a similar sequence post-epidemic is provided with the same route taken with similar elements along the way thus suggesting a link between the two existences or 'worlds'. Shaun's inability to tell the respective worlds apart is quite biting, while the zombie-like people plodding to work on board a bus very early on suggests alienation and disenchantment with their functioning lives; an overlying sense of the Western world in the form of seemingly happy kids playing football in the street amidst terrace housing and the working class and their cars already well on its way to ruin.The film scores points for moulding in the epidemic of the coming of the zombies with the drama going on between partners and housemates as well as it does. This isn't a film as interested in delivering horror genre frills involving zombies as much as it is interested, for the most part, in dealing with character and story. The film is effectively Shaun's shot at proving his worth to Liz, the winning of her back by way of proving his worth to her and ticking off all the more minor items which plagued the development of their relationship before, specifically the inability to fabricate a meeting with Shaun's mother and the threat of competition from David whom it is established is attracted to Liz. The film is a really enjoyable, expertly pitched piece full of heart and genuinely funny – the likes of which ought to be embraced.",7,0,2,18 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Improving a little on the first entry, Dead Man's Chest is not dead on arrival.
","The stakes have been upped for 'Dead Man's Chest', the 2006 sequel to the immensely popular, though I thought generally underwhelming, 2003 effort 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl': said Black Pearl, a haunted pirate galleon, has been replaced by the even more efficient Flying Dutchman; Geoff Rush's un-dead captain, Barbossa, and his motley crew of zombies have been replaced by a sadistic freak-show led by Bill Nighy, and the appearance of several new characters, not the mention the fleshing out of one or two old supporting ones, gives the film a broader sense of both scope and appeal.The film is, I suppose, little more than a romp around a series of photogenic tropical islands, but is never-the-less good, clean honest fun; a sort of physical incarnation of all those games of Lego pirates & soldiers you might have played when you were younger on bases decked out to look like desert islands or within the confines of stone-carved fortresses you'd first have to build from the instructions. There were swords; muskets; treasure chests; an assortment of characters and palm trees housing monkeys you could clip on at funny angles.'Dead Man's Chest' essentially covers the plights of two separate lead characters, a good looking clean-cut civilian with an honest trade, in Will Turner (Bloom), and a roguish, smooth-talking pirate in Jack Sparrow (Depp), whom nobody ever seems to truly get along with within the confines of the film yet nevertheless everybody loved within the public domain after his debut in the 2003 original. In the Bermudan town of Port Royal, stronghold it would appear of the British navy some two hundred years ago, and certainly in an alternate universe, Turner and his love, Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) are arrested on grounds of treason for helping a condemned man escape justice. The local governor hatches a plan to let them both go, but only on the grounds that Turner venture forth and bring back a particular compass belonging to Sparrow...Sparrow, meanwhile, is busily making his own escape from a gruesome island prison which seems to be the sort of place that locks prisoners up and forgets about them, an early indication that the film is unafraid of going to some fairly nasty places. He is introduced as a resourceful chap prone to bursts of oddball comedy, playing dead and getting away in one of the many coffins prison employees are tossing away into the sea (something which calls to mind James Bond's escape from behind enemy lines in 'Octopussy') before rather mercilessly shooting open the casket and wiping out a bird that had followed his vessel out to sea. Not too long after this, he encounters an island occupied by a tribe of cannibals who elevate him to a God-like status - a mere reflection of what the public did to him after Depp's initial performance.As Turner seeks Sparrow's compass, Sparrow himself seeks the key to a certain treasure chest to whit only his compass will guide him. Hot on his heels for mostly unrelated reasons is Davy Jones (Nighy) himself and a crew of un-dead body-horror inclined psychopaths who look to settle a debt with him. And what a crew they are: barnacle and rot-covered fish-like creatures, wavy tentacles and pained expressions, involuntarily vomiting up seawater - disgusting to look at but a technical marvel within the confines of filmic imagery. One of these monsters, played by Stellan Skarsgård, turns out to be Will's father and it is surprising how affecting the scenes are between the two characters as they converse about their respective situations.Broadly speaking, the film attempts to re-enact 'The Good, the Bad & the Ugly' on water - vast, open swathes of desert become the open seas; horses are traded for boats and six-shooters become cutlasses. The American Civil War is substituted for some kind of battle for naval supremacy between rival factions. Director Gore Verbinski has a lot of fun encouraging the audience to root for Bloom's character to succeed in his mission and save the day so that he may go home and walk off into the sunset with his soul-mate, but that means forcing the audience to go against the character they like the most, which of course is Sparrow, who will meet a grizzly end at the hands of Davy Jones should he fail.This interplay, like with the aforementioned Leone opus, between the varying sides keeps both the energy and interest levels high. It is something which culminates, of sorts, in a standout sequence involving three different characters sword fighting with each other across the beaches and forestry of a desert island; into the ruins of an old church and then on top of the most durable waterwheel in cinematic history. This is then further ramped up when members of Jones' gang turn up looking for something one of the initial three has on their person.'Dead Man's Chest' is not great art, but it brings a smile to your face - whether that is through two pirates, who used to be un-dead, but are now alive, conversing about mortality, or via the head-spinning yet strangely steadfast logic of Jack Sparrow as he bargains his way out of another sticky situation, is up to you. For me, the film seemed to iron out all the problems I had with the first one, in terms of pacing and why I was supposed to at all care about those on screen, and run with a similarly magnetic approach, the likes of which I can't say I didn't enjoy.",6,1,1,25 August 2019
Rocky V," Fresh fights for Rocky and the Balboa clan, but most of the 'hard hitting' you'll see is the depiction of their living conditions.
","The ground that the Rocky films have treaded has become so visibly worn; so evidently eroded, that one might just as well usurp the Rocky statue perched at the top of those concrete steps over there in Philadelphia and entrench it beside the path synonymous with this franchise, so that whenever a screenwriter decides to traverse said path, may they be reminded just where they're headed. Then again, maybe those steps ARE indeed the physical manifestation of such a path, and the statue is in the right place anyway; a public thoroughfare whose appearance in these Rocky films is about as expected as the training montages and the 'final fight' sequence. It is pleasing, then, to be able to say that the positives outweigh the negatives in 1990's Rocky V; a very, very goofy film but not totally devoid of quality. What indeed appears to merely be old ground once again being traversed turns out to be a film mostly about a family and about relationships people have outside of the ring It is to this extent one dares to say that upon its release, Rocky V was the best Rocky film since the '76 original.The film will kick off with Stallone's Rocky Balboa arriving back in America following his brutal fight with Dolph Lundgren's young Soviet that climaxed the last film. A national hero, Rocky is barely off the airport grounds before a press conference is called in a hangar such is the demand - but our eponymous boxer skirts informing them of the health issues he has due to his taking of all the Russian punishment and additionally shies away from a fresh challenge from an exuberant black promoter; their tough young runt fighter and a shady looking white agent. Actually, it is his wife Adrian (Shire) doing all the talking in this regard, and we're reminded again of the last film when Drago's partner did all of his talking at his conferences. Looking forward to retirement in his huge Philadelphia mansion chock full of mementos and his loving family, disaster strikes when it's revealed someone as reckless; knock-about and often drunk as Paulie (Burt Young, Adrian's brother and Rocky's brother in law) has botched all of their money away to an accountant and his bad real estate schemes. Leaving his financial adviser's office, Rocky and Adrian walk over a reflection on the floor made by a circular window just above them: the design has it look like they're walking through a sniper's crosshair as the elements zero in on them. With no money, Stallone troops his characters back to their greyer, bleaker beginnings – wherein Adrian worked in a pet shop and Balboa himself paid regular trips to Burgess Meredith's old sparring gym: there is a flashback of unrealistic proportions in length once he's back there when he remembers a little too much of a training session he once had with Meredith.Things plough on and Balboa's son, Rocky jnr (played by Stallone's real life son Sage), winds up at a school that sees him have to deal with a bully problem via his fists –perhaps designed to echo how his father and Apollo Creed were once rivals until they came to mutually appreciate one another through their time spent fighting. Mirroring the realism in Stallone casting his own son to play his son is true-to-life boxer Tommy Morrison playing Tommy Gunn, a well-spoken and enthusiastic young fighter from Oklahoma who turns up looking for Balboa, his idol, to coach him into a being a professional. I even read that Morrison took up boxing after seeing the original Rocky film anyway reinforcing this more grounded, realistic tract the film has. There is this sense that, having gone through the pain barriers and having climbed the ladder culminating in a fight abroad with the likes of Ivan Drago, there is nowhere else to go after representing one's county. That final composition of Rocky IV that features a Stars-and-Stripes draped Balboa having conquered the Communist enemy, one of the franchise's more famous images, could be seen as the culmination of a man's career: where does one go from there? In spite of the evident hypothesis, the film is not without its faults, although its positives outweigh its negatives. The strand about Rocky's son falling out with Rocky out of not paying him enough interest is weak: your father's working, leave him alone, while this manic idea the film seems to think is more substantial than it actually is, that Gunn is replacing Rocky junior as the son-like figure, is just silly. What tries to make itself apparent, however, is the notion of just how much Gunn hated his own father when he was younger, and if the film would like Balboa to adopt this fatherly/mentoring role for Gunn where he is substituting his own son, the later rivalry between the two carries with it this dynamic of resurfaced spite on Gunn's behalf.But we enjoy the film overall, it feels more mature than the previous sequels; as if it's telling a movie about sports and those involved in sports instead of a movie with sports in it. This atmosphere of things shifting; things moving on is apparent by the hour mark, when Gunn fills in as the film's protagonist for a while and the young, Creed/Lang-lite black challenger from the opening has been pushed out of proceedings as the potential opponent for Rocky's latest bout. When the final fight does eventually come around, we observe the film's final act of resistance to submitting to hardened formula when it arrives in the form of a street fight more-so an official, ring set clash. Ultimately, the series has not been as toned down as this since its first film, and Rocky V is all the more better because of it.",6,4,5,12 April 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Flailing the high seas.
","I suppose the fact that Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl depicts a sword fight between two immortals that lasts for several minutes is really the clincher that the film does not amount to much more than a bit of throwaway nonsense. The scene, wherein it is readily identified by both parties that the futility of their actions can be equated only to their skills in sword fighting in the first place, epitomises just how much director Gore Verbinski is enjoying himself and just how much his audience aren't. For many years, the notion of what happens when an unstoppable force meets and immovable object has befuddled physicists; it may very well have to take second stage to the conundrum of what happens when two invulnerable forces do battle to the death. Do not think there is any attempt at solving such a riddle, for the director is merely pleased with the fact he's bringing all of this spectacle to life in the first place. It falls to all the usual Hollywood mistakes and annoyances: visual and oral bombardment consisting of grandeur tracking shots put to a booming score, while the completely ill-judged decision to cut back and forth from harmless comedy to scenes of a massacre represents American event-movie directing at its very worst. Like most of its ilk, it's too long and while there is some heady adventure in there at times, the film is too bad too often to actually get too excited about.There is no secret in the fact the film struggles with its narrative, seemingly desiring to balance the role of protagonist between three different people but only really ending up telling the story of a doomed crew to a series of fancy edits and prolonged sword fights. Somewhere down the line, ideas either ran out or became cross contaminated; the film is quite so evidently in love with its opening act that it hardly seems to want to launch its characters into a quest, while restless audiences will merely crave the opposite. And then there is that opening act, where, for all the errs of its ways and evident mistakes later on, the film starts surprisingly well. Beginning several years before the main body of the text, the film first depicts Elizabeth Swann on board a British galleon during the colonial era spying a young boy in the water. Once aboard, she discovers his true nature in that he's a pirate – a sworn enemy to those on board but she keeps it a secret out of feeling quite fond for him and not wanting to see him lose his life. As the years pass, Swann grows up into Keira Knightley while the boy matures into Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and they stay loosely connected; he becoming a blacksmith, she already in the rarefied circles of already being a Navy Governor's daughter.As a young adult, Swann is living a suffocating life on this Jamaica-based outpost of the Empire; suffocating in every sense of the word in as much her tight fitting corset apparel is forced upon her just as much as her father's will seemingly is. Played with an ample amount of both sneer and sympathy by Jonathan Pryce, daddy sees fit to remind her that a certain Navy Commodore with a name like Norrington would make a fine suitor. Elizabeth can only wish for something more, something in the form of Turner with whom she would never stand a chance but for her peers. Enter Johnny Depp's rambling Jack Sparrow; a smooth talking, all-action although ultimately unorthodox pirate who doesn't shoot first and ask questions later since he doesn't carry a firearm and is too busy dropping a one-liner on you as he makes his daring escape anyway. Certainly, when compared to the other pirates in the jail cells, Sparrow strikes us as somewhat different; a man who risks capture if it means saving a life but is cold enough to exploit the life if it means saving his own. The initial incident launching everyone into motion arrives when Geoffrey Rush's evil Captain of the damned attacks the British fort and takes Elizabeth, something that forces the previously at-odds Sparrow and Turner into going after her by themselves.Structurally, the film spends too long in the port city of Port Royal before finally launching itself on the gigantic quest encompassing nautical traversing; un-dead enemies and a whole host of fight scenes. Thirty minutes into the actual adventure, we want to go back to Jamaica; where ramshackle characters with problems; desires and feelings played out in an environment brought to screen intelligently and energetically with a rich amount of costume and mise-en-scene for the colonial era when Britain ruled the waves. The film is generally problematic, with Depp and Bloom's buddy partnership not hitting the mark and this ridiculous narrative falling in on itself when further complications arise to do with the banishing of a curse. Once enough is enough, the film begins to outstay its welcome; the score gets louder and things that might've resembled human beings in the early part have become action figures for a child's imagination during playtime. The film is far from terrible and it's made with a boyish enthusiasm, but with the money; design and, some might say, the cast quite evidently at hand, enthusiasm and good intentions are not enough.",5,1,2,9 August 2013
12 Angry Men," Best Film of all time??
","12 Angry Men is one of those black and white classics, It's a great film With Henry Fonda,(Meteor) and Lee J. Cobb(The Exorcist) It's about a court case, in which a boy was accused of murder after he killed his father. Then the Jury, the twelve angry men, have to decide his sentence, Be is he Guilty or not Guilty. There's questions all through the film about whether if he did it or not. You want to know if he was Guilty or not? Well then watch the film, you may think its some old black and white dribble, but its more than that!",9,0,1,13 November 2000
Beauty and the Beast," Whilst covering a couple of genres and delivering an interesting study or two, the film retains a heartfelt and innocent quality that still works.
","Beauty and the Beast is a classic fairytale if ever there was one. It's a film about discovery; about adventure; about venturing off and away from home or a comfort zone to explore and discover. This exploration will be littered with danger and threat but it will evoke an element of magic and the unreal for equal measure although the smart move Disney make in Beauty and the Beast is that they do not clearly define who the 'villain' is and nor do they dumb down this role. In fact Disney bring an air of study and greater extent to the material other than shoddy metaphorical content, something that they very rarely did so before this and thus; Beauty and the Beast earns its place amongst the circles when talking about some of their best films.The film could be read as if told to us aurally, that is to say the immediate beginning is being narrated to us and we have rough sketches that look as if they're straight out of the Medieval era presented to us in story book fashion. These still images confirm to us of a Prince's back-story of how he became so hideous in appearance and how his castle and its inhabitants became so equally physically deformed, some of which are transformed into items that resemble their role in the castle whereas some others are not. Here is an interesting study of character 'bodies' within film, a brief reference to centuries ago during which what you wore would immediately tell others of your 'role' in the world ie; Royalty, jesters and peasants would all clearly be labelled by the clothes they wore  this is significant due to the various items the castle's workers are transformed into and the manner in which the 'style' of the early images are presented to us in that mock, Medieval fashion.So if characters like Mrs. Potts (Lansbury) are transformed into a teapot because she's the maid that makes and brings the tea; the Stove (Cummings) is transformed into his namesake since he is the chef and the flirtatious French maid is transformed into a brush to signify her job as a cleaner then it's possible to read into the fact the two individuals we the audience follow more often than not, those being Cogsworth (Ogden Stiers) and Lumiere (Orbach), are of a certain elevated level since it's difficult to place a candelabra and a clock into a realm of profession within the domestic environment. If there's one thing people have had fun in reading into over the years then it's Disney and their particular animation styling they choose; characters with lean or fat builds can signify one thing; characters with very astute or pointed expressions another whereas a rounded character with a big smile and bright blue eyes could easily be associated with heroic tendencies.The Beast (Benson) himself is not necessarily transformed into something as he is turned inside out. The character of the Prince is an unkind 'beast' on the inside and has these psychological characteristics switched so he must physically resemble a 'beast' or a monster, cruel and consuming none-the-less. But Beauty and the Beast is more so a character study of the mind rather than just how fancy Disney can make and force us to identify with each character's animation. As a character, Belle (O'Hara) plays the protagonist and like most female Disney protagonists, she lacks a motherly figure but does her very best to figure out what's right anyway. As a character with a persona she is smart and outgoing, an independent woman who will not conform to stereotypes but will maintain an attitude that has an element of feminism throughout.Her mission through the film changes a few times, on one occasion actually reverting back to a prior one. Initially she sets out to rescue her father, Maurice (Everhart), after he is kept in the very castle the Beast inhabits following a similar exchange comparable to that of the enchanted woman at the beginning when she also requested shelter from outside forces. Things take a turn for the worst and Belle's new goal having achieved the last one is to stay behind with the Beast after which she must get used to. Belle begins the film within the filmic space that is 'the farm'; a simplistic and rural setting which is located within 'the village', a setting in which all inside is 'good' and everything outside is 'evil' or at least unknown and mysterious. Belle doesn't conform to the caricature she should do within these spaces and this is highlighted with a wonderful early musical number in which the villagers call her 'strange' and 'funny' because she's a free thinker and she reads books.Completing a future love triangle is Gaston (White), a physically powerful and space dominating character who possesses so much love for Belle, it leads to obsession  you get the feeling in the real world if Belle had developed a relationship with someone else in the village, Gaston may well have challenged them because of it. He dominates his assistant Lefou (Corti) in the same manner Beast dominates his assistants initially within the castle planting a seed in the audience's mind to do with power struggles and what would happen if these two came up against each other. But Beast becomes more human when he seems to treat the assistants with more respect and is presented in compromising situations such as looking daft following a bath, whereas Gaston goes the other way. The film is a great study for certain things and will no doubt remain highly rated in years to come.",7,1,2,14 October 2008
Hostel," A Disappointing 'horror' film that has its moments and its gore but nothing much else.
","The general feeling I got after seeing this film was that it was split into three different segments, or thirds. The first third was something out of a teen comedy film; resembling something such as 'American Pie' or 'Eurotrip'. The second third was the gory part; with the film relying on violence and shocking images to see it through with the final third solely guilty of resembling a gritty, criminal revenge film. Although these things were done correctly and the director made the most of the material he had in mind, 'Hostel' was a disappointment overall.Some things that went well early on included how the film represented women. Going into it in a first viewing, you might feel a little disgusted at the way they are represented as loose and as absolute tramps in comparison to anybody else. Each female character seems to come onto the other male characters very easily and none of them have any problems with any of them seeing them naked despite the fact they don't even know each others names. Although this actually fools you as later on in the film, when a twist involving two of the girls at the hostel in revealed, the general feeling throughout this opening segment is that girls are mere objects whom don't care who they pull or how they do so. Even if the representation is accurate in Amsterdam, you have to doubt whether or not a lot of the happenings in this film actually occurs on holidays or wheather it's just a screenwriter's wild imagination at an attempt to shock a film-going audience.Another clever piece of film-making was the sole character of Josh. Although relatively unsure throughout the film, nervous even; I feel the audience maps onto him the most. The character is not sure of his surroundings, weary and rather tentative. I feel that any member of the film's target audience watching the film, whom have not been to Amsterdam, might be represented through this character as the surroundings seem new and intimidating for him. Evidence of this can be seen when he is unsure about paying for sex at the brothel whilst his friends jump at the chance and even earlier on in the film when he tries to convince his two accomplices that maybe they should visit a museum or something, instead. This was quite clever and since the first proper death/torture scene is him as the victim, it made it all the more disturbing since the audience may have mapped onto him the most.Where Hostel goes wrong, apart from its three thirds structure flaw, is suspense and horror. Yes, the second third is 'horrible' but is this really a 'horror film'? There are no jumps, there is no real 'bad guy' monster/villain character and there is nothing uncanny in the film at all; just a bunch of European Patrick Bateman's whom want to let off some steam on young adults. In fact, because of its realism, it's more of a comedy at first, tragedy in the middle and then it ends with revenge, action and drama. We are shown the house of pain too early on when we learn what has happened to Ollie, spoiling the surprise/suspense and to be honest, the film feels like a documentary for most of the opening thirty minutes as we follow these kids around as they smoke drugs and get laid; it's really quite disappointing as the film goes absolutely nowhere. I realise that this was supposed to build up sympathy as we begin to relate to the characters but how can we relate to them (the other two, at least) if we dislike them more and more due to their antics? This is what happens when people think with their balls instead of their brains. In fact, an example of a better build up would be 'Wolf Creek' which is a similar type of film.Even if the final third is a gripping revenge tale with a good mix of suspense as they try to escape, disturbance as our hero has his conversation with an American torturer and gore as a girl's eye falls out; Hostel in the long run is a very disappointing and poorly structured film with too many incidences of content taking precedence over style.",5,0,1,17 January 2007
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Solid mythic adventure film, but all too often striking us as having been made with one's head more-so one's heart.
","Films of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe's ilk were a dime-a-dozen at around the time of its release. Unleashed upon us once the Lord of the Rings films had had their fill of our cinema screens; somewhere in the middle ground of the Harry Potter Franchise and then preceding projects such as The Spiderwick Chronicles, one can only muster up as much enthusiasm as one can when offered yet another magical, mythical adventure fraught with danger and wonder but driven by kids. The project in this case is a film based on the immortal books by C.S. Lewis; an English author who wrote about the trials and tribulations encountered in a magical land named Narnia, to which the entrance was of course granted at the back of the most famous wardrobe in literary history. One could argue Lewis was ahead of the game in this regard; writing which was released around the time of Tolkien's fictitious escapades in Middle Earth as youngsters ill-suited to their dramatic, danger-filled surroundings took on the elements. It is sad, then, that Andrew Adamson's adaptation of the first in the Narnia series is mostly as colourless and nondescript as all the other fantasy adventures in spite of its cherished, game-changing foundations.Andrew Adamson's previous two films were both Shrek and Shrek 2, and where there was more of a biting energy in those films which subverted fairy tales and folk stories. Here, Adamson has gone all out to take something back from those projects in his production of a full-on-fairy-story with enchanted kingdoms and talking animals which is played for grimaces more-so grins. The tale begins in Wartime London, a city prone to attacks by the German air force as Hitler's armies sit perched across a small stretch of water at what potentially lies in wait. Trapped in the chaos of what will forever be remembered as The Blitz are the Pevensie family consisting of just their mother and her four children: Peter (Moseley); Edmund (Keynes) Susan (Popplewell) and Lucy (Henley) – a unit already mourning the loss of the man of the family to the war and now stuck here in their garden shelter as the flak rains down.As was with many at the time, these kids are shipped out of a war torn London and into the countryside; a greener, safer locale where they may wait out the war with elderly guardians. Those unfamiliar with the historical importance behind such course of action, or indeed already aware of said item and looking for a decent dramatic depiction of it, should look no further than a late nineties production entitled 'Goodnight Mr. Tom'. The children are not a congealed unit, they argue; bicker; brand one another 'selfish' and fall out pretty easily. Boredom and disillusionment at this large countryside house owned by a professor, who does not at all strike us as a professor, gives was to a harmless game of hide and seek wherein the eponymous wardrobe allows access to the wintry world of Narnia: a place where animals speak; war between two set sides broods and the key characteristics of the landscape and climate is snow and the freezing cold. Although as is custom in these films, the youngest discovers the secret first but no one around believes them.Narnia arrives with its own set of challenges; there are allies in the form of Beavers and Lions, of which feature the voice talents of Ray Winstone and Liam Neeson, but then there are enemies and it is Tilda Swinton's White Witch who comes to be the chief threat. Along the way, the kids in the film learn (with the design being that the message will transcend unto the kids in the audience) the value of teamwork; of working together, especially if you're of the same blood, and that accepting sweets from strangers leads to bad things... My confounded inability to recall the books as well as I'd like does nothing to guard the criticisms I have for the film, a film whose worst characteristic is that it's a tad flat and whose content is, at the worst of times, often asking to be merely disregarded as nonsense. The text's carefree approach to the material, on top of its generally cartoonish aesthetic as a palette of bright colours and a range of contrasts sets the scene to what is ultimately a bloody fight to the bloody death, highlights its child-orientated thematics of fighting on through strife and using one's powers responsibly more than I would have liked.Director Adamson works here with live action for the first time, although he breaks himself in easily with the retaining of some of what he's used to in the form of CGI animals voiced by famous people prancing around the screen looking expressive. He gets results out of the young cast, who do a thorough job in playing people put through the wringer before being asked to go and win a war that a Lion cannot against a pack of wolves and middle aged woman with a steely gaze. But the film is a stepping stone project more than anything else and the best you can say about this particular adaptation of a famous piece is that those involved do a professional job with an eye to move onto bigger things.",6,1,2,20 May 2013
Happy Gilmore," An unhappy viewing experience which sees some rather disturbing material play out under a guise of adolescent comedy.
","Happy Gilmore is one of the more distasteful sporting comedies you'll see, a film that tries to take sociopathic behaviour; marital problems; care-home abuse as well as rage and render each of them content that we may or may not find funny. The film's opening sets the tone in both the misjudged humour we'll be spending the next hour and half sitting through and the cold detachment from the piece we'll feel, when a mock home movie is established to be in the capable hands of an individual before they are killed at an ice hockey match. What happens next is the same 'home movie' aesthetic of the sequence, but this time with an 'invisible' shooter of the material. Such a ploy, after establishing a rather nostalgic tone to the piece before horribly killing of the camera operator, sets up the alienation the film has from the real world and will go along way in detaching us from the daft reality of its own – we feel disconnected from the off after I doubt there are many people in the world named Happy, but Happy Gilmore's Happy Gilmore is named-such, and he's played by Adam Sandler. I think Happy is, in fact, Happy; but the things that make him happy are things that do not necessarily make the rest of us so – it is the same relationship the film has with humour. Happy's life is built around conflict and pain. Throughout the duration of the film he'll be in direct competition with a rival sports star; he'll have a disagreement with some Ice Hockey coaches over whether he makes the team; he'll partake in stylised S&M sessions with one of those automated machines that pitch baseballs in full public view and a wrestling match with an alligator I suppose captures that insane rush for conflict and adrenaline that he so badly craves.But Happy's chief, overall source for conflict is with the state itself, when it is realised his Grandmother's scenario is that she must leave her house of many-a decade and move into Ben Stiller's prisoner of war camp-like run nursing home because of unpaid taxes. Consequently, big bucks on the pro-Golf tour seems to be the only way in which he can raise said funds. There's something quite pleasant, quite heart-felt about having to take up something new and as difficult as Golf for sake of those close to you, in the sense you're doing it all for them – but Happy Gilmore renders Golf something the lead has to do out of necessity, mocking those that play before taking it up himself and failing to undergo any significant on screen changes in terms of attitude. One wonders whether, at any point, he was ever enjoying what it was he was doing. In taking up Golf, antagonism born out of a rivalry with tour veteran Shooter McGavin (McDonald) arises, as does a friendship with Chubbs Peterson (Weathers) and a tour PR manager called Virginia Venit (Bowen) acts as a love interest.I think Happy was in love before; his relationship with a girl at the beginning is observed as he talks dirty down an apartment intercom as his girlfriend walks out on him for unspecified reasons. Given his temperament, something that we come to learn more of as the film progresses, I think it may have been because of one or two instances in which he struck her, but the harsh realities of why this relationship is now off is completely ignored when a frat-boy sight gag is inserted into the sequence. Later on, he'll be asked about what happened between them and he'll lie to them that she died. So, are we sort of behind Happy because he wants to help Grandma out? Or are we anti-Happy and his antics because he, quite possibility, beat up his ex-partner a few times? Then again, we probably dislike the character of Shooter McGavin more than Happy – a man that feels Happy is destroying Golf but then contradicts himself in hiring an individual to put Happy off his game. Everything clashes and just ends up being a bit of a mess, systematic of both the film and its content.Within the universe of the film, Gilmore can complete a round and head onto the next tour stop without ever having to face both the disturbing the peace and assault charges which would surely have been brought against him in the real world. The use of violence and destructive behaviour for sake of laughs is woefully misjudged in Happy Gilmore, turning fits of rage and destruction of objects items of near-slapstick. One sequence sees a fistfight between an elderly man and Happy on the golf course; one that should have ended in the hospitalisation of the elderly man and a jail term for Happy. However,the need for violence-infused laughs wins and this is not the outcome. There's something really distasteful in watching a fight between two people being taken to the level it is when, in reality, one of the two parties would be dead from their injuries.One wonders what Happy might've done, given his predicament involving his Grandmother, without the sport of Golf. He may have become a foot-soldier to a local crime boss – forever being sent out to break the fingers and arms of those that owe the kingpin money. Happy's describing of swearing, fighting and breaking things as 'fun' captures the film's overall tone, and acts as a pass-key for the less informed viewers of the sick spectacle that is Happy Gilmore to additionally have fun – we're even treated to what it's like inside Happy's head, in which a bikini-clad Virginia and unicycle riding midgets rule the roost. For all its stupidity and ineptness, the final insult is that it all boils down to a 'final green' climax, in which very basic rules of Golf are twisted for sheer dramatic effect. A sad and depraved effort.",4,0,9,4 February 2010
Public Enemies," Not exactly 'number one' in the Mann back-catalogue, but Public Enemies is a roaring and pulsating return to form which will certainly suffice.
","This surely must be the proof that Michael Mann can now make these sorts of films in his sleep. Public Enemies is an interesting retreading of old ground, a thriller focusing in on the criminals whom run the show and the police officers charged with taking them down; you don't need me to tell you which of Mann's films this most sounds like. I think a degree of getting back on track accompanies Public Enemies, much like Tarantino's film from that same summer of 2009, Public Enemies is a going back to basics for a man whose last film was flat-out woeful: a deprived and stupefying exercise named Miami Vice. If Inglourious Basterds was an acknowledgment of the tried, tested and failed experiment that was Death Proof; and began with a sequence involving a Nazi officer and a scared French farmer somewhat reminiscent of Samuel L. Jackson's Jules and his badgering and interrogating an apartment room full of kids as he senses what he wants is nearby, then it was Tarantino as a whole going back to what he is most known and liked for in Pulp Fiction an re-jigging the material to win us over again. Here, Mann revisits the same sort of material he's best known and liked for, in 1995's Heat, only he delivers Public Enemies with a slight re-jigging in that it's a retelling of the plight of real-life gangster out of the 1930s: John Dillinger.There is no Pacino chasing De Niro around modern day L.A. here; instead, the still rather ample replacements of Johnny Depp's Dillinger and cohorts running amok in a number of locations, predominantly Chicago, and Christian Bale's Bureau of Investigation agent named Melvin Purvis, an additionally true-to-life character, after him. Mann's toying with the material is an entertaining and substantial enough yarn, the men here apparently connected not by way of the fact they know not how to do anything else nor their link in that they struggle domestically with their lives and friends around them; there is no coffee house scene to highlight the similarities both men share as they occupy different sides of the coin, but there is a sequence when Dillinger and Purvis stand opposite one another whilst Dillinger is incarcerated. What follows is an exchange that sees both men forced into recognising they share the same experiences with death, specifically the deaths of friends and co-workers, and thus are somehow intrinsically linked. It'll sound loose and flimsy, but then few will say it's a better film than Heat anyway.Dillinger's superiority when compared to other criminals is established in the opening sequence, a scene that sees a number of jailed prisoners out in the courtyard shuffling forward whilst chained together in drab, striped prison uniforms. Cut to Dillinger, by himself, and being escorted into the prison whilst decked out in a smart black suit and hat. That small sense of hierarchy is complete when it's revealed he's there to aid in instigating a breakout. Meanwhile, Purvis is on the run after gangster Pretty Boy Floyd through some woodland; Purvis' men outnumber him but Floyd's automatic weaponry dwarfs Purvis' bolt action rifle: the catch being Purvis is a crack-shot, and we soon find out that he is. The link between the establishing of both men is chase, Dillinger's dominating of the guards as he lays siege to their watch tower outside the jail in getting away with most of the men standing in contrast to Purvis' chasing and apprehending of Floyd; Dillinger's dominance of his pursuers and Purvis' clinical efficiency of his apprehension of those fleeing neatly teeing up the later match between the two.It is indeed after these pleasantries the film becomes the game of oneupmanship you'd expect, a cat and mouse thriller in which both sides suffer losses, lick wounds and revel in glories. Like Heat, the principal thief character in Dillinger is given a somewhat spur of the moment love interest; someone he promptly sleeps with, falls for and promises to ship on out of the country with in due time. Here, rather than De Niro promise Amy Brenneman's Eady tales of New Zealand, we have French actress Marion Cotillard's character Billie Frechette coming into contact with Dillinger and tales of far off nations plus the good life. Billie's character arc is given due attention, the sorts of dangers that face her becoming slow realities after a handful of incidences and the stark realisation of which side of the fence she's on becoming gut-wrenchingly apparent when a police station beating occurs. In a film about a feud-come-relationship between two men, it's pleasant that Dillinger's bonding with Billie doesn't detract too much.The film is punctuated with an array of shoot outs and heists, heists often turning into shootouts; the centrepiece of which is a woodland area shootout perhaps comparable to that grandeur post-bank robbery shootout which spilt out into the street and beyond found in Heat. Supporting characters on either side are not given us much attention here, but at a small cost; with an interesting sequence unfolding later on, in the camera lingering on Purvis' pained face as a captured and injured gangster in serious need of some anaesthetic lies next door being interrogated – these are sadistic and cruel methods being administered in sadistic and cruel times of crime by the enforcers of the law themselves. Does Purvis seem minutely allured by it all? A small taste of what Dillinger himself inflicts, either physically or by reputation, on people all the time? It'll remind you of Barbara Stanwyck's perverse expression-come-smile in Double Indeminity, as her crippled husband is strangled next to her; it's the feeling of being this close to off key, off colour tactics for the first time to garner what you really want, and it comes out perfectly in the slightest of facial expressions. Mann is back on track after a temporary blip, and here he and his team have crafted a fine thriller.",7,0,0,28 July 2010
Madagascar," The Lion King it ain't, in what is an often languid animation doing well to stop the then bandwagon from rolling on any further.
","Above all else, Madagascar is just a misfire; something which is surprising given the genre within which it falls into and the company whom produced it. On the heels of 1995's Toy Story, the most influential English-language American film of the last twenty years in both a commercial and technological sense, an array of digitally animated films clocking in at about 85 or-so minutes found their way into cinemas and pretty much across the board ticked enough boxes to keep audiences coming back for more and more. The audience cross-pollination sagged here and there with the likes of the first Shrek, whilst narratively floundering on the odd occasion with the first Ice Age, but were on the whole energised and uplifting films telling simplistic tales and done so with the right politics in mind. 2005 saw the release of Madagascar, a foray into this territory which is tiresome and discentered; clocking in with one of those aforementioned short run-times but feeling longer; a piece unsure as to whether it's got an animal rights message at the core of it or not and not entirely certain as to whether it's a prison 'breakout' movie; a 'castaway' movie or something along the lines of The Wizard of Oz wherein the overlying theme reads something like: 'There's no place like home'.A common criticism in regards to films such as these often lie with where they actually go in a thematic sense when squared up against where its characters go in a physical one. In this regard, the first two Toy Story films (and the third, years later) barely got beyond that of a neighbourhood block located within the digified universe those films were set, and yet that sense of adventure and character progression was omnipresent. Madagasacar lurches from New York City to the open seas to unpopulated-by-humankind tropical islands run by lemurs; extravagant recreations of the streets of the Big Apple arriving in tow with that of impressive, expansive compositions of waves and the wilds of the ocean roaring around a large container ship. Yet, the film is essentially a lot of running around and shouting by that of voice over talent we feel have been cast based on who they are moreover whether their voices suit the characters they're brining to life.The film covers an array of animals more commonly associated with the wilds of Africa than that of New York City, and their adventures are here depicted. Initially based at an open plan Central Park zoo, we are quick to associate the supporting acts with an array of what might be perceived as clichéd New Yorker archetypes. There is the David Schwimmer voiced Giraffe Melman, who's paranoid about germs and mental health and strikes us as an anthropomorphic representation of those unshaven, long haired trench-coat wearing middle aged men we often picture babbling to themselves and anyone who'll listen as they shuffle down a public street. There is Jada Pinkett Smith's Hippopotamus Gloria, a larger than life black woman setting (along with Beyoncé Knowles's Foxxy Cleopatra from 2002's second Austin Powers sequel) African-American stereotypes back about twenty years with her hearty, exuberant, jive-talking' cander. On top of these two, there are a handful of monkeys whom best try to capture your more standardised city-set commuters whom intermingle onto subways and such in their coats; hats and with their newspapers sipping coffee from beverages cups and downing donuts since they missed breakfast.At the core of all of this is that of a friendship between a Lion and a Zebra, Ben Stiller's king of the jungle in Alex and Chris Rock's striped prey-of-said-beast named Marty – only they don't initially know that one is one and the other is indeed t'other. Things kick off with a dream sequence wherein Marty wishes to be out and free and bounding over Savannas away from the pen and public ogling. Where one feels suppressed, the other feels the opposite; Alex is a guy who loves the attention and the praise paying customers heap onto him as he roars and struts and acts out to his audience. Through some events involving the zoo's penguin population, of whom are already concocting their own plan to escape to their indigenous home of Antartica and of whom are the best thing about the film, Marty, with most of the rest of the animals, breakout and land in heaps of trouble following brief integration with the outside world. Events have them shipped back to their natural habitat, but they end up shipwrecked elsewhere in a place which is never sure as to whether it's a Utopian paradise and represents everything Marty wants nor an unnerving Dystopia wherein true colours are brought out in people.In essence, the central pairing of Marty and Alex grows tiresome; Sacha Baron Cohen pops up as an energetic leader of a group of those previously mentioned lemurs, but sports a misplaced mock-Indian accent and merely sings and dances a lot as everybody else avoids the native hyenas. The film is a confused effort, a film at one point exclusively about a three-way power exchange; at others a cast away movie, yet ultimately a piece which looses sight of its depicting of Marty's lessons on the wider world being a larger, scarier thing not as glamorous as he initially thought. There rears up this tract about realising life always finds a way, and that existence demands thins thing called the 'food chain' in constant operation; a sad, downer tone applied to the harsh realities of life then blown apart by newfound instances of cheating nature by wrapping everything up with a nice, happy ending wherein everyone can co-exist and the hyenas are the villains. It is mostly nonsense, colourful and exuberant nonsense, but nonsense none-the-less.",5,0,0,2 March 2012
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Scathing attack of a movie observing how one nation's work infiltrates another's quiet, innocent existence with issues of censorship and spectatorship at the forefront.
","It's somewhat peculiar that the feelings and notions linked to the build up to initially watching South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut many years ago would go so far as to actually contribute to the themes and ideas that the film itself is looking at. Here is a film that everybody it was meant for, as well as those that it wasn't, just had to see at some point in their lives. For those that couldn't, we had to wait until it was released in the latter days of the video cassette and hope to have it bought for us; either that or have a school-mate, whose ill-informed-on-the-matter parents had been easily fooled by the cover's cartoonish qualities and central positioning of four young and smiling children complete with all Hell breaking loose in the background, lend it to us.The cartoon series hadn't been around long, but it'd been around long enough to garner the sort of attention its creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, would have both wanted and expected. Of course, I found the film hilarious the first time I saw it; it was the sort of humour anyone my age would have done, but as the years have gone by and I've watched it ever-so often since; the screenplay and the various situations that play out are still as funny, as the greater study that the film observes unfolds around it, all the time under a huge umbrella of self-awareness and send ups. There must be people other than myself that still evoke a chuckle at scenes such as the one in which a character's mother's televised debate with an angry Canadian individual gets rather heated, as well as a U.S. general's debriefing before a coming together with Microsoft's Bill Gates as they talk of how frustrating it is to work with Windows '98.The film is absolutely shameless in its opening: a crude and somewhat tame looking establishing shot of something that in any other film, particularly animated, would fill us with awe; that being a mountain range. We zoom out of this badly drawn and uninspiring looking peak to the town of South Park in Colorado, U.S.A. and Stan, one of many characters voiced by Trey Parker, partaking in a spoof-rendition of the opening of 1991's Beauty and the Beast as he observes his home town. It's a poignant start to a film which is, essentially, all about this young boy and his observations of the world and, ultimately, the art around him. If everything established is perfect in this Utopian setting, then it is only by way of an outside agent that anything can interfere. One such line from Stan's opening song sees him remark on the one negative aspect of his town; that 'you see homeless people, but you just don't care'. The important thing here is that by the end of the film, indeed the journey, Stan will still observe, but will come to care about the things that make something less than perfect, and he will learn to have opinions on the observations he makes.The film predominantly revolves around censorship, in particular the want to censorship an art form of some-kind. In South Park's case, a patched together Canadian comedy film about two individuals called Terrance and Phillip indulging in nothing but a series of low-brow gags. Naturally, the new 'event' movie sees the four kids of South Park; named Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman; go along to see the latest release from yonder-border â€“ with horrific results. The film opens up all sorts of problems for the boys and shortly after the cinema visit, they're swearing and cursing like nobody's business. The mothers' reaction sees a campaign for a banning order followed by an actual war with Canada when they apprehend Terrance and Phillip.Amongst all the chaos and the jokes, it's difficult to loose sight of what the film actually does; that being a coming of age tale which explores the importance of spectatorship and viewer awareness when it comes to film. The real life connotations linked to the fact a number of people under the age of who it's for wanted 'in' on the Soth Park film unearths an eerie sense of art echoing life. The sneaking in and the observing of the film causes a war between two nations, whereas one character attempts to re-create what he's seen characters do on screen only for him to orrifically perish as a result, in what is a clear demonisation of this notion. Later on, Cartman will go off into a song number in which he will churn out a number of offensive and racist jibes, much in the vein of the Terrance and Phillip movie, in what is a further demonisation when it transpires he then has some sort of anti-swear hardware installed into him.But the boys mean good overall, they're just caught in a wave with the rest of the herd. They each share the same idol; an American figure skater named Brian Boitano, an athlete of sorts, whom to them embodies all the necessary positive characteristics of dedication and enthusiasm to win through in the end. Additionally, as an overall study, the film is in support of standing up for what you believe in and promotes individualism in regards to specific subject matter. In this regard, the character of Stan is used for such a message. But its outgoing statement on censorship as a bad thing, and that art is to be viewed as it should be, I have no problems with. The film explores these notions by way of presenting the parents of these children as ill-informed and unaware of what their children are watching, just as they allow them to roam the streets in what was already established by one mother as a would-be ludicrously safe-haven in which nothing can go wrong. Two words: Wake Up. Observe the text yourself before you pass onto others.",8,3,3,2 September 2009
The Girl Next Door," The film is a handsome surprise, albeit with comedy which doesn't always work and stances not hammered home; regardless, it is a hearty and substantial enough piece.
","The Girl Next Door actually makes for a really involving and respectable enough piece, at least it does so right up to the point the lead nabs a peck with that of the titular girl next door. The whole thing might have made for a really smart short; Luke Greenfield striking us as a director able to slot together a telling piece and as a person able to establish; engage; progress and then conclude, with the film loosing rather a bit of energy once everything tanks to that the deserts of Nevada for a lot of running around and the forcing of the lead to having to infiltrate a mansion. Ultimately, the premise of a porn star moving in next door as a kid and his sexist, overly hormonal friends burgeon from school to university rings false; that is to say, the film is in no way the turgid, unholy mess that is worryingly promised when we observe it is about such a thing. Rather, the film takes its idea and decides to put its surprisingly likable young lead through a wringer of anti-social interactions; altercations with dangerous people and through a series of threatening situations which might spiral out of control after having been dragged to places those within feel they are adept to, but in actual fact are punching well above their weights.The young lead is that of Matthew Kidman (Hirsch), an individual on the cusp of shifting from one level of the American educational system to the next, that of high-school and on into a somewhat prestigious university to study politics. Kidman is stuck in a proverbial middle-ground of no man's land within the realms of his school's social hierarchy; he is nowhere near that of a hardened jock, as is exemplary in the masses of cock-sure young men and their large automobiles-plus-successes-with-women whom surround his educational zone; but he is additionally, and on account of two frizzy-haired friends of his, several steps up from being labelled of the 'geek' variety - Matt just existing on a plateau populated by himself as this middling kid, with few distinguishing features nor behavioural patterns. The finale of high school is nearing, and yearbooks are in the process of being filled; our Kidman struggling in that he cannot get words onto paper nor photographs of into albums when challenged with the idea of recording the events and the people that helped form him in his time there. The kid is on the verge of graduation without having faced the ignominy of marginalisation at the hands of the institute's proverbial bullies, nor indeed has he intermingled at the opposite end of the spectrum by garnering success at having captained the school's champion Football team to glory.The film covers somewhat of an important chapter in Matthew's life as he dares to branch away; dares to push the boat out and get heavily involved in something seemingly way over his head, a general happening brought about by that aforementioned pornography actress. Elisha Cuthbert plays that actress, a woman named Danielle; a woman of slender figure, slinky movement, pouting lips and bright blonde hair, whose moving into the house next door to that of Matt's parents takes very little time for him to notice as such. From these beginnings, an energetic tale is spun out of a young adult with a blossoming persona which could tilt either way, and it is Danielle who goes on to further him down the route of formulating memories; something to write about and pictures of whatever that is required for that part of the yearbook - the joy being in how it sways him towards a mindset more inclined to be nastier and more sordid, before pulling it back and keeping it grounded whilst not falsifying its politics to any alarming extent.Eventually, that of Timothy Olyphant's pornographer Kelly Simon enters proceedings; the film constructing somewhat of an initially positive and reassuring image of the man before slowly peeling away at the surface and beginning to paint a scummy, abject incarnation of the individual. His arc in this sense runs in tandem with that of his field's representation, which is sort of shown up, as a vacuous; aggressive minefield of maliciousness once everyone has been dragged out to Las Vegas for a Doug Liman's 'Go' inspired romp so as to escape a proverbial wrath, although appears to recall that the film's target audience may very well be all-too fond of such things and thus, disappointingly restrains said politic from being too damning. Principally, the film is a coming of age; American high-school orientated sex comedy following someone nervous about the sex and with an attitude to the comedy which is strictly grounded and politically straight-and-narrow. The film's presence of a female, specifically that of someone whom specialises in being a star of pornography, is not the flimsy, loose-cannoned and misjudged procession of smut and trash that it might have been; rather, it is about a woman coming into the life of a young man, but being able to have the power to shape and inspire rather than roll over and play dead as an object of one's fantasies. The Girl Next Door is a middling, oft confused piece, but with content to get involved in and characters to get behind: a welcome change for the usual fare of this ilk.",6,1,2,30 July 2011
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Speaking of Ice Ages, this is often glacial; what was quite charming has evolved into a bit of a carefree slog in which we cannot get involved.
","A thaw is the chief threat to the lead characters in Ice Age: The Meltdown, the unfunny sequel to an original film from four years earlier which transported furry, anthropomorphic animated creatures of a bygone century back to a time when ice and snow blanketed the world and the issue of evolution seemingly didn't exist. Where there is a literal thaw within that of the film, there is a parallel one of exterior nature seeing the whole idea of these somewhat likable little characters and their adventures coming to wear rather thin – the film striking us as an exercise in looking to feed off recent glories by churning out sequels and sit on a soap box in the process. The error of the film's ways is in its removing of everything that made 2002's Ice Age fun; primarily, its character dynamics and its hybridising of an era set thousands and thousands of years ago with the modern-day. Here and now, there is very little wit to 'Meltdown'; a film about characters making this huge trek across snowy wildernesses as this impending item of doom and destruction threatens them, and yet rarely feeling like anybody is actually going anywhere at all. Toss in a really meekly handled global warming message, designed to attune the kids to such an issue, but coming off as heavy handled; some annoying supporting characters and the fact that all of Ice Age's own ingenuity and charm has been stripped away from this project, and you have a fairly lacklustre computer animation which goes on for too long without engaging.The film begins with its characters in a pleasant enough place: a neat little Utopia built upon the icy plains of whatever stretch of land this is further-still tucked away in a makeshift corner which sports all you need to generally be able to relax in life. Located therein is Sid the sloth, voiced again by that of John Leguizamo whom, as it was in the first, provides Sid with the lispy and goofy verbal tones required to have us easily take to him. He runs what can only be described as a summer camp; a place for the tots of this world to come and play and swim and listen to stories told by that of the supervisors. Also there are Diego (Leary) and Manfred (Romano); Diego being the sabre-tooth tiger whose plight in the first it was which made him change from being the cold-hearted predator killer and into, well, someone whom still eats meat, we assume, but never his good friends the sloth or the mammoth. Manfred is that mammoth, and after some brief beginnings which feign as if to set up a different movie entirely more broadly linked to Sid's inability to communicate with the opposite sex; failure to establish order as the governing force of his workplace and the still-lacklustre levels of respect he has from his peers, we veer off and away down a route encompassing Manfred and his problems.But that comes a little later. First, there is a vulture and the ultimatum he offers to those located within this little zone. Principally, they all have three days to pack up and ship out, for that large cliff face-come-glacier behind them acting as a shield to anything and everything beyond it is beginning to melt out of a collective warming. The vulture warns them because he doesn't like wet food; their trek across the planet to find somewhere safer and away from the soon-to-be incoming wave of has-been ice block a journey he and his buddies hope will see them perish. Premise in mind, and a rounded deadline of three days one would assume that crafty vulture has specifically waited to unload unto them, the animals take the plunge and head off; thus kicking into gear one of the more sporadic and less involving animated pieces from recent years.Granted, there is something funny about a descendant from a squirrel named Scrat constantly chasing a nut – the likes of which rely on the physicality of the situation and the character's own flexibility. We are aware he cannot ever obtain the nut and the fact he often falls flat on his face in trying to retrieve it is second to how he goes about doing it. The pleasure one derives, although really ought not, from these skits leaves the rest of the film as unenjoyable as it is; a series of interludes relying on escapes from precarious situations and situational comedic content involving characters voiced by the likes of Queen Latifah (anybody who calls themselves 'Queen' Latifah is practically asking to be ignored) to see it home. Examples of the magisterial levels of wit buried within Gerry Swallow and Peter Gaulke's screenplay arrive in the form of a whole pack of vultures doing an Oliver Twist number as well as a routine involving eccentric, pint-sized would-be desert island tribal creatures doing dances and such evoking the Eric Darnell movie from barely a year previously, in Madagascar.The film becomes Manfred's, and an internal/existential crisis through which he journeys to do with whether there is much point to carrying on if he is the sole mammoth left. Of course it turns out he isn't, but for time-limit's sake, it'll take some time to convince this newfound mammoth that they are what Manfred tells them they are – cue some rather risqué, and often out of place, gags about first dates and how far down the line heterosexual relationships need to be before whatever. The first Ice Age was a difficult film to dislike, 'The Meltdown' is a very easy film to not take to at all; hollow praise aside that is 'does' whatever 'job' it needs to in order to quench entertainment driven thirsts of families encompassing that of young children, this first Ice Age sequel is just disappointing.",5,0,0,11 December 2011
Oldboy," I expect Oldboy to age rather quickly.
","Oldboy is a film that is colourful and cinematic. It blends martial arts and action in with a plot in such a way, it's easy to just ogle at the special effects and stunts on show. Oldboy in terms of these stunts and effects is just another example of Asian film and what they do so well but this is an example that was unnecessary. Certainly, you have your 'art' films in the form of Hero and House of Flying Daggers that rely heavily on sublime aesthetical quality as well as stunts and hypnotically good music but with Oldboy, it's like it's merely 'House of Flying Daggers: for teens' and this is because it just tries to gross the audience out whilst use a lame revenge story to fill in the blanks.There can be no denying that Oldboy tries to tread filmic ground that teens will have no idea even existed and this comes in the form of voyeurism. There is a scene in which a boy sucks the breast of a girl whilst another boy secretly watches from a nook in the wall  what's interesting here is that not only is the third party's view in point of view format (meaning that it's supposed to signify us watching) but half way through, the girl pulls out a mirror just so that she can watch her own reaction to the activity being carried out.The film eventually starts out like any other revenge film  a guy is back on his feet after a stretch in a prison of some sort and goes after answers as to why he was there. The film tries to play cat and mouse with a mysterious cell phone: 'Whose calling?' and 'Why are they?' Yes, I wonder. He also manages to shack up with a female character after an encounter in a sushi bar that involves a particularly memorable scene involving an octopus that I knew nothing about until actually watching the film. This is where Oldboy begins its journey of a revenge film gone very, very wrong and I don't mean that as a negative statement, it's just that Oldboy is so audacious and over the top in its delivery of rather pointless content that when you think about it, it's difficult to get too excited.Oldboy fails to suck you in  it just doesn't create an atmosphere. Despite its ratings and 'disturbing content', I actually found the film to be rather upbeat, almost like a comedy at times. There is the humble breaking of reality when the film pauses and a dotted line showing the intended line of attack a hammer will undergo once that character swings it is funny more than anything else. There is also an emphases on 'nothing dialogue'. When two people are talking down the phone about a formal school girl from years ago who was, from their memory, 'a total slut'; I was wondering if this was meant to be funny or if it was setting up a character for later on or whatever  I was left confused more than convinced. There's also plenty of room for ancient Chinese or Japanese or maybe even Korean proverbs that characters spout to one another. This is Oldboy again trying to be something it is not.In regards to the 'gross, sensitive' content, I say 'what content?' The guy eating the live octopus was surprising more than it was gross  I've eaten both octopus and squid before (obviously not live) but so what? The sex? Well, what about it? Try Basic Instinct or Boogie Nights or anything else of that variety. Again, it's for teens: 'Oh look, a sex scene(!)'. The 'graphic scenes of torture' involves someone having their teeth yanked out.....for about three seconds. Again, try watching work from Takeshi Miike or one of the Hostel films. Yes, Oldboy was violent what with its hammers and its snapped toothbrushes and its broken up shards of compact disc but so what? Violence is in most films these days. To conclude: Octopus scene = Surprising; Torture = Brief; Sex = Soft; Violence = Graphic so that's one out of four done to a graphic extent.Oldboy failed to impress me in ways it has others as I just know there are better films out there. It tried to be something that it wasn't yet at the same time, has some redeeming features that keep it from being an out and out 'bad' film.",6,4,9,23 August 2007
The Secret in Their Eyes," Perfectly fine and perfectly rounded little thriller with more grandeur-a aspirations to be what isn't quite; The Secret in Their Eyes makes the grade more often than not.
","There can't be many actors working within Argentina, indeed the world, with a presence-come-expression, or 'tone' about his being there as there is with Ricardo Darín. The man's solemn appearance twinned with the general low-key immediacy to his being on screen is in no way an insult; on the contrary, for most of his work in terms of the characters he has played, a downcast and lonely-cut figure of an individual with some crucial decisions on his mind has seen him close to being always perfectly cast. His expression just seems sad, as if the weight of the world rests on his shoulders and there is nary a person within a hundred miles whom can help him deal with it – if we were in the film with him, we might see ourselves wanting to lend a hand. Here, that man is dropped into a film whose narrative is a weaving, twisting plot kicked off by a pretty harrowing catalyst and left to those primarily involved to stew in juices that do not involve a whole lot of justifiable help from the authorities whom operate distastefully. Here, Darín plays one of those protagonists placed on the front-line; a character who, at one point, has to literally kick away at a yapping, puppy-dog sized mutt in what you might categorise as self-defence but is an action born out of Darín's being in a place he initially should not have been. Not many protagonists in movies can kick a dog belonging to a somewhat elderly woman and still have the audience on their sides after a breaking and entering offense, even enforce a guffaw out of the whole situation: Darín can because we're on his side the moment we see him.His character here is Benjamín Esposito, a man we first encounter in a place of dwelling all to himself as the thoughts; memories and his own envisages of what might have happened during past events he was not present at, haunt him. Now, he attempts to turn what it is he has experienced into material worthy of selling as the written word; the lack of a word processor or even a typewriter suggesting a man of a particular age, the crumpling up of several sheets of paper despite some fairly competent renditions of his work wryly hinting at a man obsessed with detail and figuring things out to their perfect denouement. The film, Argentinian set, will flick between the present day and the latter-half of the 1970s; those of whom knowledgeable of contemporary Argentinian history (or have at least caught Christopher Hampton's 2003 film Imagining Argentina on the off chance) will know that the said era was one of a distasteful nature. An ongoing case to do with the rape and murder of a young woman across the street from some construction workers that were eventually blamed plagues the past, the reunions between those predominantly involved with investigating such a case doing so for the present.The film kicks into gear when Esposito, in the present day, visits a long-time companion from that case named Irene Hastings, played by Soledad Villamil; a woman he can still remember first laying eyes on and for whom a fair while has passed during which time he has harboured certain affections. She is a judge at the law firm at which he worked, pleasantries and niceties giving way to solemn silences when the Morales case, long-since closed from decades ago, is mentioned inducing now somewhat glum faces. Like Esposito displayed during the opening, she can be eloquent in her dictation and has a similarly high level of skill with words; the film exploring their relationship in the present day as much as it does the link they had when they worked tirelessly back in the day. The Morales case is indeed the crime revolving around the deceased young woman whose perpetrator, its seems, got away with what he did and the film flashbacks to the time and place it all unravelled so as to follow Esposito team up with an alcoholic co-worker named Pablo Sandoval (Francella) in the attempt to try and tackle the state-led enemies in order to dig out the truth.The film is an interesting and brooding piece without ever being overtly involving; it painfully, and granted the accolades it has won, even confusingly did not necessarily strike me with quite clearly the same verve it did to many-a other. The film is a competent but plodding piece, somewhat televisual but rather plump and rounded in its neat, free-flowing causality as one thing moves onto the next and a power struggle erupts between two sides. I spent large portions of the film wandering to myself precisely what it was Darín's character did; eventually pluming for a sort of hybridised role encompassing journalism, archivist and police work. There are moments that the film leaps off of the screen and enraptures you, but do so more out of the sheer jump in aesthetical quality than anything else; take, for instance, the sweeping shot from high above a football stadium but ends in the rafters of an end behind the goal, a sequence which strikes us as the cinematic bolt-from-the-blue because it probably belongs in a better film.Make no mistake, The Secret in Their Eyes is an able-bodied enough little investigative thriller but it is so without being overly confrontative nor particularly daring; its cat-and-mouse elements leading up to and beyond the apprehension of whom it is they assume to have committed the murder are engaging enough, but are counterbalanced by instances such as a key scene in a central relationship whose chief moment of emotional release is relegated to the status of a self-aware cliché, which still doesn't stop it being what it is. You could do a lot worse than The Secret in Their Eyes; the film is a fairly decently executed, well-meaning character study but which, frustratingly, did not strike me as much as I would have liked.",6,2,7,4 April 2011
Black Book," Fascinating spy thriller set amongst World War Two with genre fusion, twits, turns and war-time action to soak up.
","It felt as if Black Book was a James Bond story taking place during the Second World War but with a female lead instead of the man himself; it felt as if it was the sort of James Bond film that is half way between that espionage, intrigue and one-liner Bond that we knew for years and half way between the 'updated' Bond, ala Casino Royale. Fact of the matter is; this is a secret agent, 'sexpionage' spy flick that includes elements of genuine romance, subplots within subplots and gritty wartime violence  I also found it to be better than all of the Bond films as well as the first two Bourne films.By the time the end of the Second World War arrives in Black Book, about a half hour to the end of the film, the film has the audacity to keep going. But such is the audacity of the film; to have the major event the film is set beneath finish but the plot to only become further complicated as the proverbial grip is tightened; never before have harmless Dutch villagers waving miniature flags been such a juxtaposed backdrop for underhand and nasty events of double cross and murder. Black Book is a European produced film that does not really fall into either of most of European cinema's dominant aesthetics; those being 'art' and 'realism'  you can tell the director has just spent the last twenty years in Hollywood. Black Book is more of a character study split into different chapters; a character study that the audience is never sure which way it will sway and a character study that would have us question if good people are actually that good and if evil people are actually that evil.The film tells the story of a mole; of a spy named Ellis (van Houten) who adopts a secret agent role but unlike Bond or Bourne or any other secret agent we may have seen in a film, she is not trained right from the beginning thus forcing another layer, another goal to her journey. This is hinted at very early on before it is even proposed that she become a spy when she says so herself that despite seeing loved ones brutally mowed down, she 'cannot cry' which tells us of soldier qualities: no matter what the situation; no matter who dies or what happens  soldier on. There is another memorable scene on a train when she uses another aspect of her future soldier qualities; her psychological reflexes and her quick thinking when a guard will shortly be asking for papers: if they ask her and the character she's with, they will be caught but she evades the situation. This incidence oddly enough leads her onto the chance encounter with Ludwig Müntze (Koch), who will the focus of the love story and will challenge her allegiances.I think what I liked about Black Book despite all the character building; mise-en-scene; sub-genre elements was the way the deaths were presented: there were no glorious deaths; there were no needless killings and whenever certain deaths occur, they just seem to play out in a brutal and coldhearted manner; that is to say you expect someone to come along and rescue them or you expect them to be able to get out of it somehow but the scenes are carried on in a brutal, almost obligatory, manner that hits home. Black Book is a teasing and temping film  it recognises men's weakness for women as well as identifying ego and utilising it for its narrative drive. Since there are not many female secret agents in film and things like the Tomb Raider films are too lacking in subject matter to endorse this sort of ;'expoinage' idea, Black Book is a welcome change to the usual 'kiss, kiss, bang, bang' of a male action hero. This is more 'kiss, kiss, plant, report, kiss, kiss, escape, epiphany.' Black Book teases because it has the protagonist's goal planted right under their nose. Ellis frequently sees the captives being pulled around and hit down in the cellars; she looks at one of them through a window as she reels off information sheets. We, the audience, even take a break from Ellis' undercover life to witness some Nazi torture the Dutch resistance had to face. And so I am reminded of a male action hero; if a male action hero was that close; was that far into the enemy's lair  the film would be ten minutes away from ending and you can bet anything the body count will have reached large levels by then. But Black Book changes tack to a degree when elements of rescue come into play; romance when the backdrop for the film comes to an end and like most films about war, tragedy will commonly prevail.The vast Nazi headquarters makes for an excellent setting; inducing dungeons for uneasy scenes of torture, offices for the nitty-gritty dialogue and espionage planting, bedrooms for the activities enforcing elements of trust that become too intense for the character's ideas of love and bathrooms: a space that is purgatory; a space within the space of the HQ that Ellis can visit away from the prying male Germans to either relieve herself from seeing the murderer of loved ones or to get her self out of trouble (best illustrated in the scene when she needs to wash her foot)  it is no coincidence Ellis admits certain things to another character within this room. Whilst gripping and intriguing in its idea, Black Book morphs into a tragedy; a romance; a dark tail evolving around a Macguffin that is the result of treachery  a war film to savour.",8,2,6,5 March 2008
Spice World," Can you say 'Bad'? Can you say 'Terrible'? Can you say 'Disaster'?
","About half way through Spice World, it dawned on me that it wasn't going to get any better than the level it was maintaining and a nasty thought hit me: 'when people ask me why I actually motivated myself to sit down and watch this all the way through, I am going to have to think of something to say in reply rather than merely shrug and look down at the floor in embarrassment.' I found myself for the next ten minutes thinking up various excuses I could use as reasons but eventually settled for 'Curiosity'.Yes; when a film is so bad it motivates you to actually think up reasons you're going to have to say to people when they ask you why you watched it, it's struggling. As it was with Thunderbirds, I was curious as to know what the hell it was all about. I was old enough to remember the Spice Girls and old enough to dislike them but distinctly recall this film getting released. Following the break up and now apparent reunification, Spice World as a film doesn't even hold together as a piece of nostalgic nonsense that should be good enough to kill a few hours as we watch global female icons strut around in little costumes and sing silly little songs. Spice World does not even give us the luxury of having a plot; instead it is more of a documentary-come-spoof of not only the band in question but certain generic films of yesteryear. This means it plays out more like Epic Movie than anything else.Spice World is really just one massive contradiction. It contradicts itself, its characters contradict what they want to be and how they want to be seen as and even the immediate ending contradicts whether or not it is a film within a film. At the time of the Spice Girls, there was very much an atmosphere of the band wanting to take over. The title of this film: 'Spice World' suggests a world full of 'spice'; the video for the song of the same name is set in a dystopian future where everything is exactly that; the 'V' sign the girls use to signify girl power is commonly associated with 'victory', ie; Victory, girl power rules'; there is also the familiar sight of a band cashing in on consumerism and globalisation as they make their presence more known around the world. But rather than Spice World posing as some sort of political/musical version of Battleship Potemkin; its scenes play out more like a retread of films that we've already seen. Roger Moore was James Bond and he spoofs the Bond villain persona; Richard E. Grant sits and listens to film pitches alá The Player and the final incident involving a bomb blowing up not only means the film is confused as to whether its fiction or not but whether or not it thinks the fourth wall is reparable once it has been broken.The worst example of contradictory content in the film comes very early on when the girls are sitting in a bus, that looks more like an actual room than anything else, discussing how they hate being seen as the 'baby'; the 'posh one' the 'scary one', etc. Fine you think, maybe they are getting sick of that but what follows is an immediate counteraction to their complaint in the form of a montage showing each of the girls dressed as Wonder Woman, Marilyn Monroe and then of each other. The girls go from wearing their clothes, acting dumb and stating that 'there's more to us than just our persona tags' to..........wearing even more clothes and costumes and acting in an even dumber manner. You can imagine the thought process: so Ginger Spice doesn't like to be called Ginger Spice anymore; 'Ok, I know; I'll dress up like Wonder Woman and crack a whip.' Yes, I can see there's so much more to you than your generic tags. The other glaring example of contradiction in this film that the girls fall foul of comes in the form of their allegiances. Nearer the beginning of the film rather than the middle, the girls talk about how important their fans are to them; this idea returns to haunt them since the actual final third revolves around a dilemma the girls face: stay with a friend as they give birth and shun fans waiting at the gig or vice-versa. There should be no argument: they've established their fans come first but what happens is they counter balance their priorities by staying in the hospital with their pregnant friend.Spice World is a film that does absolutely no favours for anyone and that includes the girls themselves. The Spice Girls come across as plastic, one-dimensional and rather stupid; frequently getting their priorities, beliefs and ideas mixed up with one another; never giving us the impression these are smart and good people making smart and good music. The film's portrayal of Italians and homosexuals is disappointing as is the incompetent film crew consisting of a black man and a fat person; the way the bad guy is a fat, spitting Australian bent on magazine sales who has an English assistant is horrible; the film's narrative wants us to believe that stuff being printed in the newspapers by a man who gets the scoops in an impossible manner is entertaining and realistic but it's just silly. There just isn't enough space to cover all the things horribly wrong with this film but I am surprised this didn't destroy the Spice Girls when it first came out. Cheap laughs; a nasty narrative; horrible archetypes and so many times in which the focus band of the title come across as incompetent is enough to label this trash, 'trash'.",2,3,7,28 January 2008
Batman Returns," Simply, a wonderful blending of evil clashing with evil clashing with would-be 'just' to produce an interesting character piece on top of a high octane ride.
","In Burton's revisiting of the Batman franchise following his 1989 escapades, he delivers a film better than the first, in that it is more mature and spreads out to accommodate the progressions of its three predominant characters. In being given more to do, Burton essentially produces a film that is of a higher quality; doubly able to deliver on fronts of character as well as pay close enough attention to the power struggle going on within the place its set, as corrupt business'; faux politicians and sociopathic civilian inhabitants of Gotham City seem to vie with one another under the careful watch of the film's lonely, somewhat socially inept, billionaire protagonist Bruce Wayne, alá Batman.The film will see a variety of characters, three of which are bound in not only their power struggle but also by way of having their names linked to the animal kingdom, interact and form respective bonds as the future of a bustling city hangs in the balance. Two of the film's four central characters are monsters, one a slick and handsome business tycoon named Max Shreck (Walken) with the other a foul, thrice-decade sewer inhabitant named The Penguin (De Vito). This, as the two that complete the quartet struggle with their own issues of violent mask and costume-clad alter-egos which clash with quiet, lonesome and restrained 'by day' personas in Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer's Selina Kyle/Catwoman.The film begins with a grandeur and quiet frightening opening, that of a disfigured baby being born and consequently disposed of by the parents, a nasty sequence in which they head out into Gotham City park in the dead of night avoiding contact with other parents of newborns and tossing the kid over a bridge into a canal. As we watch it float down the various waterways which lead to the sewers, the camera lingers on this baby's cot as we observe it through long pipes and steel barred drain entrances as it drifts, seemingly harmlessly, down the rivers of the city and into the sewers. We are given time to ponder to ourselves what foul, household cat eating beast lies inside. When get a first glimpse of the creature in its adult years, it is by way of an expressionistic shadow, furthering a sense of the uncanny.Indeed, many years later Max Shreck sits in a conference room delivering a talk to some of his business cohorts. His business, simply entitled 'Shreck's', has its HQ based in a high-rise building amidst the others, looming ominously over Gotham; his company's logo on the very top, spinning around and around insinuating the power in the numerous directions the company has in the holding of its power over the city. This, as models of the same logo lie strewn around other Shreck infused buildings. The logo is of a smiling animal, but there is a degree of unsettlement in its features, most certainly echoing what the owner of the organisation is like and has in store for those that dwell in the city – like Shreck, it is a face that seems to mean well but whose true intentions are much more sinister.Working for him is Selina Kyle, an individual who makes it very obvious she lucks out on men and life in general. Upon being present during Shreck's talk, she attempts to join in with the suit-clad, ego driven businessmen in making a suggestion but is promptly put back in her place with a cruel put-down from Shreck plus a statement which enforces her domesticisation, despite her shortcomings, in that she makes 'a Hell of a cup of coffee'. Kyle maintains a seemingly odd relationship with her mother by way of the messages she leaves on her answering machine, while the numerous stuffed animals and child's toys scattered around her room maintain the odd aura. When a chance event leads her back to Shreck's office, she accidentally dominates her surroundings by way of ingenuity in cracking Shreck's password to some top secret files; files that reveal acts of a criminal nature – the consequent punishment for this act of attempting to 'become big' within the office environment is death, instigated by Shreck. Essentially, an event that tips her over the edge and by way of some alley cats; the uncanny rejecting of her previous image as well as a little black magic; becomes the powerful and somewhat man hating creature of Catwoman.The Penguin, in setting up a false rescue of the mayor's child, ascends to the surface with Shreck as his companion when a blackmail plan arises. What you flush, Penguin flaunts – an idea of things coming back to haunt you when you don't rid your life of them correctly. Despite having this pointed out to him, Shreck makes a similar mistake by only assuming Kyle to be dead when he attempts to kill her, only for her to return and cause chaos. Penguin embarks on a mayoral campaign after winning over the city as this myth becomes reality, but while everyone is fooled, Wayne isn't and there's a superb scene in which Penguin goads Batman for having a direct approach in conversation despite hiding beneath a mask – there's a moment of realisation when Batman makes it known he's guessed what Penguin's up to, and that he too has a mask on in the sense he isn't the person he says he is, despite, again, the direct approach in reaching out to all the inhabitants of the city. The film's blending of character with a distinct sense of dread as these power-mad people threaten to consume an already bleak looking world actually comes across as quite interesting as certain images of a disturbing nature and individual scenes of menace keep it grounded from reaching too far out to children. The film is to date, of all the contemporary Batman films, my favourite.",8,1,2,12 February 2010
Superbad," It would seem that what amuses most, disgusts me.
","I suppose it's not surprising Superbad has hit the nail on the head in certain circles and become so popular. Here is a film that takes the fears of a specific age-group and spins them around onto their heads by turning it all into comedy of the farcical nature. Young adults old enough to see it in Britain with its '15' certificate and 'R' certificate in The States are able to witness the things they're truly afraid of get moulded into acts of would-be pure hilarity for their own amusement as three hapless male individuals of varying size, stature and type are lumbered with the 'fall guy' tags.But for everyone else, Superbad is exactly its title and anyone who thinks otherwise is either lying or trying to come across as one of those people who understands what the youth of today demand – that or, they've realised this is generic film-making and have smirked a few times; thus allowing a recommendation. In short, Superbad is complete garbage. Its passive approach and disgusting humour shouldn't really appeal to anyone older than 18; I mean, what goes through someone's mind when they're being treated to a montage of pencil drawn phallus' and thus, probably laughing their heads off? Incidentally, what goes through a screenwriter's mind when they presume everyone will find it funny in the first place? I'm not sure if it was the drawing of the phallus'; or the stained menstrual blood on the trouser leg; or the repetitive spitting onto people; or the alcohol-driven vomiting (which happens many times); or the visual re-enacting of sex acts behind a girl's back that disgusted me the most. Others will come away asking themselves which of the above they found funniest, and that is a frightening, frightening testament as to how low we may have sunk.Superbad is the sort of picture that forces you to lower your self down a few notches as you try to comprehend these characters, their actions and their beliefs. If you're not down with the idea that 'girls exist purely to be slept with and ogled at' and that 'parties are the be all and end all of good recreational time spent' and that 'alcohol exists to be over-consumed', then you're simply not going to 'get' it. The film announces both its intentions and overall tone in a convenience store very early on. Two of the three leads in Seth (Hill) and Evan (Cera) mosey around, talking the usual trash talk to do with attempts at getting girls to sleep with them before the film pretty much lost me after five or so minutes. I am additionally surprised these people have even heard of people like Orson Welles and The Beatles.The film's primary study is about trying to tap into fears and insecurities the sorts of people on display in the film might have. But do I think someone trying to buy alcohol whilst under-age is funny? No. Do I think gags about possessing condoms and lube is particularly worthy of a laugh? Not at all. Do I think the manner in which one character describes how he positions certain parts of his body within certain pieces of clothing at all humorous? No, no and no. Will the people that laugh now and give the people that write this junk their fame think it all that funny in years to come? Of course they won't.So along with Even and Seth, the latter of whom spends the whole film shouting at everyone, you've got a guy called Fogell (Mintz-Plasse), whose alias 'McLovin' provides some of the film's more would-be non-sex or bodily function related gags, too bad none of the McLovin jokes are funny either. These three undergo a hapless night out which kicks off after the liqueur store Fogell is in trying to get drinks from is robbed and two of the most inept police officers you'll ever see, in a film, show up. Seth and Evan think he's been busted, Fogell goes on a brief night out with the cops and everyone gets involved in all sorts of slapstick nonsense.The film is a brief and unwanted glimpse at what it was like to be a specific age during which nothing but the usual things on display here existed in your own universe. It is a sad take on a generation of males, all of whom are portrayed as they are in this piece. There is supposed to be some sort of social class antagonism unfolding, what with the banter about one person getting into a 'better' college than the other one but it isn't developed at all, whereas the 'frienship coming apart at the seams' narrative which opens up towards the end is limp and forced – I didn't fall for it in 2003's 'After School Special' and I'm not falling for it here. Superbad is a mess, made popular only by the youngsters hungry for another Kevin Smith (whom I additionally don't particularly like) inspired, crass take on youth life of a male in crisis and critics out for cheap laughs, whilst desperately attempting to seem 'down' with today's youth. It's the American version of 2004's Sex Lives of the Potato Men narrowed down into a 12 hour time-frame and with a little more talking about sex rather than indulging in such acts. Such a statement ought to be enough to steer anyone clear of this mess.",4,2,6,30 April 2009
The Great Dictator," Chaplin manages to deliver in his most well known talkie but this still isn't his best film.
","Being quite a fan of Charlie Chaplin following good vibes after seeing first 'The Gold Rush' and then 'City Lights', I was eager to see 'The Great Dictator' as I had been told this was, arguably, his best film. I was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, Chaplin-wise.The start is typical Chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, Chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. It was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic Chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is spoofed. Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. The way in which English in mixed in with the mock German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favourite joke was the five minute speech Hynkel gave, only for the English translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of Hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.Historically, the film got a few things right as well. Hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something Hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, Hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at Hitler's underhand technique of winning over the German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children. He must be OK!). The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. Films such as 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. Chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.What I didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. This slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. The film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. The 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.During the final straight, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact the Italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. It works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when Hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). Despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact I felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, The Great Dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.",7,2,5,6 January 2007
Alexander," Strenuous and generally difficult to stay alert to, this opus on Alexander the Great is anything but its eponymous lead's nickname.
","Like Costner's lead in 1991's JFK; Barry Champlain from the earlier Talk Radio and then Pacino's lead character further back in 1983's Scarface (whose screen writing credit is the important thing here) Oliver Stone's 2004, centuries-ago set Hollywood romp Alexander covers a male lead with an insatiable desire to conquer; a thirst to break through the boundaries which govern the 'rules' of the established norm so as to make a name for himself against extraordinary odds. They are Stone movies about fiercely competitive, and often fiercely temperamental, people capable of quite extraordinary things within a specific field. Costner wanted to un-Earth the truth about a killing; Champlain took on a sordid, invincible God-like figure whom constantly pushed the envelope when his radio show went national, and Pacino's Tony Montanna decided to run the Miami narcotics trade single handedly. Here, Alexander's eponymous lead, Colin Farrell's Alexander the Great, of around 350 B.C, tries to take on and rule the world – you can't blame a guy for trying'.The difference between Alexander and what preceded Alexander is that Stone goes on to make a complete hash of it. Here is another Oliver Stone film about a man who just doesn't know when to call it a day; a film driven by man who carries on a hunger for progression long after most guys would've called it a day already – we arrive at the project expecting rather a lot, but come away on this occasion with a frightening sense of numbness and disappointment. Stone has never been the sort of person to necessarily produce 'small' films, but his Alexander here is what 1984's Dune was to David Lynch; a big and bombastic exercise in stunning vistas, emphasis on genre convention and stars in funny outfits doing its best to try and get across persistent senses of scale. It fails miserably.The first we see of Alexander is that of a stone model of his head, and a large bird of prey swooping down delicately dissolving into the close up of the would-be statue - the correlation between our titular lead and some sort of predator, some sort of brilliant beast feared in certain circles is alluded to before later confirmed when an edit placing a close up of his eyes with that of another bird of prey's occurs. The film is narrated to us by a man whom stood beside Alexander through his battles, an elderly and bedraggled Ptolemy, who's played by Anthony Hopkins, speaking as warmly as he can about the tribulations and twists of Alexander's life all those decades ago. As a youngster, Alexander lives with a brute of a father, but he's not around for long, as well as his mother, Olympias (Jolie). Jolie plays Olympias as a woman who is all charm; Russian accents and is often clad-in-snake. Alexander sits, with a bunch of other kids his age of whom are speaking in English but with an Irish twang in spite of the fact the whole thing ought be in Greek, or whatever, anyway, and he listens to the great philosophers of the era speak of how the mystery shrouded and dangerous 'East' are death traps in-waiting for all those whom go anywhere near it. Naturally, Alexander becomes someone gunning to invade it.Along the way to growing up, he will learn to tame horses; how to take control of situations; become a swordsman and fall in love - all the necessary things, you might say, to instill that he is a warrior in the making. Stone will pound us into the ground during the mid-section of this three hour chore with the repetitive mention of the names of people and places on top of a ton of historical exposition. At the beginning, Hopkins speaks of how Alexander was able to instill great belief and how one was proud to be alongside him; not long into one campaign, in which the land of Persia is conquered despite the fact the one fight we see involving Farrell's forces has them beaten easily, what Hopkins said is totally contradicted when clear distrust and anger at Alexander's leadership within the army rear up.There is room for our Alex to fall in love, but it will essentially be to one or two of his friends of the male variety more than anyone. In spite of this, Alexander will marry Rosario Dawson's Roxanne. The funniest scene of the film occurs when she accuses him of homosexuality and he attempts to make love to her in reaction, something that is quelled when Dawson turns it into a session of brief face slapping and power-play on the bed involving a knife to her husband's throat. This grip of accusation Roxanne has on him, although drenched in truths, sees Alexander unable to face up to them and can only be nullified when a trinket in the style of a sadomasochistic restraint is removed from one of the two persons so that heterosexual bonding may play out away from the vice like 'hold' of knowing homosexual ties both parties identify exist. A lot is spoken about Wolfgang Peterson's Troy, which came out at around the same time, in regards to Alexander; I liked Troy more – a film which got on with things and at least told a story whilst maintaining a fair amount of this sense of conflict as two sides warred. Alexander is an episodic, one-note and melodramatic lesson in history for anybody unfortunate enough to be roped into it.",4,1,3,20 December 2011
Hot Fuzz," Luke-Warm Fuzz.
","Hot Fuzz is one of those films that creates a love/hate relationship with most people. Those that don't 'get it' will no doubt hate it but those that like films like this and pretty much use films like this as a cut off point for their further filmic viewing will love it. I have to admit that I am veering more towards the 'hate it' category as I've seen rather a large amount of films and can honestly say close to brainless, all action and comedic films like this are only fun every once in a while.I do, however, think it's fantastic to see Britain produce films like this and Shaun of the Dead given the state of affairs Hollywood is in what with all the sequels and remakes that are being made and what better way to make it big in the States by spoofing those action films Americans have become all too associated with. Hot Fuzz is really just a stab; it's a stab at many things. These can include minor stabs at small town police forces or full blown stabs at films that rely on ridiculous, over the top action scenes; two of which are mentioned in this film anyway (Point Break and Bad Boys 2) and two of which are referenced very cleverly to boot.Also, if you've never been a member of the police force or have never been in a small town/village police station, who knows what goes on inside? The fact the station has its own 'swear jar' and a riot gear storage cupboard that is covered in cobwebs through disuse is absolutely hilarious, as is the relaxed approach all the officers have. I especially liked the head of the CCTV thinking he had a very important job to do when really, nothing criminal happens so there's no need for him to even be there. Another clever convention that the writers included and at well spaced times was the emphasis on seemingly meaningless jobs. So many times do we see focus on Nicholas Angel (Pegg) having to deal with insignificant tasks such as recovering a lost swan or having to deal with a church fete yet they are still moulded into the plot somehow in a clever and entertaining way.If Shaun of the Dead was a parody of zombie films then like I said earlier, Hot Fuzz is a parody of Hollywood action films. The scene when Danny Butterman (Frost) shoots uncontrollably into the air from a lying position and when the chopper flies overhead in slow motion as Danny and Angel emerge from the wreckage are two scenes straight out of Point Break (1991) and Bad Boys II (2003), respectively; both of which, when they eventually occur are fantastic to watch in an oddly surreal way.On top of this, towards the end the film seems to cleverly flick between reality and fantasy. The scene in question is when after spoofing so many films in an ultra unrealistic way, the film has the audacity to turn down the chance to use a one liner and this is mentioned by Danny to Angel who replies back something like 'No, that's only in the movies.' Very funny yet playful with the testing of realism at the same time.What Hot Fuzz lacks for in brains, it makes up for in style as it cleverly switches from opening like a dramatic, cop thriller before turning to an episode of 'Inspector Morse', before morphing again into Bad Boys II and then completing its transformation when it finishes like The Wicker Man (1973). Some jokes however don't work, especially the character of Simon Skinner (Dalton). His constant references to decapitation get very tiresome very quickly and might just as well walk around with a placard saying: 'Here, I'm the bad guy' but this is cleverly played with later on as we assume the writers take us all for mugs. On the whole, if you can look past the things that make Hot Fuzz look more like an hour and a half long spoof show, you'll find a funny and at times engaging film that despite its flaws will pass the time very easily.",7,2,4,25 July 2007
The Mummy," Extravagant and sprawling romp through some fairly familiar, but involving, territory which encompasses upstanding protagonists; end of the world plots and slight romances.
","The Mummy will begin in that old fashioned, mythical manner in that an off screen narrator verbally informs us of a legacy of events which prelude the body of the film; the tone that of an old storyteller, even fable-like in its sounding as the oral informing us of a time gone by and actions which happened is put across. It's an opening slice of narration that might just as well as seen its scripture begin with the line: 'Once upon a time, long ago, there was a great warrior.....' Stephen Sommers' film will go on to flit manically from tone to tone and from content to content; a harmless, teen-aged orientated throwaway action flick one minute, a rather hardened and somewhat full on horror piece venturing into territory you just do not initially entrust it will go anywhere near, the next. His film is a romping, old fashioned escapade through adventurous territory and old fashioned mythical sensibilities; a film with a foot in the science fiction, what with its content linked to characters able to bring people back from the dead and flesh eating monsters that do not exist; horror and post-Indiana Jones action adventure.The aforementioned story of the opening loosely goes on to describe a forbidden romance set in an alternate ancient Egypt between the then Pheroh of that time's partner and one of his entrusted high priests named Imhotep (Vosloo), something that leads to her arranged death and the sentencing of the priest plus his aides to live mummification, a process loosely described by one of the leads a little later on as something not particularly pleasant if we weren't already familiar with such things - although, it does beg the question as to whether it's even possible to actually be alive during said process for anything beyond that of about two seconds.Fast-forward from ancient Egypt to the same nation in the 1920s and enter the lead, an American mercenary named Rick O'Connell (Fraser); a brave man, a man with the ability to take control of a hostile situation as he leads a band of men against some aggressors at a protected burial site; to use an array of weaponry with consummate ease and who additionally sports an array of meal insignia on his tunic suggesting experience and expertise within this field – he is the ultimate warrior of the age, a modern-day action man eventually going up against the cursed; blood thirsty values and mindsets of that of the ancient. Also in Egypt, and not so far away, is Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz); an educated English woman working in a library whom outlines her credentials and skills to her employer purely for out benefit when he challenges her. She's a little pit perky; a tad goofy because of the mess she makes at her workplace and the manner in which she makes it, at one point having to balance precariously on a ladder.Her laid back and often amusing brother, named Jonathan (Hannah), then brings into her possession an artifact which could spell some serious archaeological ramifications. Following the obtaining of an imprisoned O'Connell, given he is vital to where it is the artifact will lead them, the trio set off for the deeper; sandier and more barren spots of Egypt to uncover greater truths about the trinket it turned out Jonathan stole from O'Connell, a trinket which is more broadly linked to that of the opening ancient Egypt-set story. What will come to form between Evelyn and Rick is a lightly played but fun enough romance beginning with O'Connell dismissing the moment he kissed her from behind his barred jail window as something which 'seemed like a good idea at the time' because he was 'about to be hung'.On the journey with them, but in opposing camps, are some greedy American treasure hunters whom enjoy their gunfights along with their own English academic, who's sexist, and led overall by the weaselly, one-time buddy of Rick's named Beni (O'Connor). The two troupés rolling along dusty; desert terrains to orchestral bursts of orchestral music, MacGuffin in hand, as the sun beats down and the treasure lies out there somewhere, is quite good fun at the best of its times; although Rick's ongoing and somewhat inexplicable feud with Beni is hardly the stuff of Blondie and Tuco. One thing leads onto another, the eventual resurrecting of Imhotep spelling disaster for the rest of everyone as he wrecks his revenge on the world he still sees as the one that forbade his genuine love for another. The film engineers into a race against time against the seemingly indestructible villain, the moment he's got all his bits and pieces together to complete the resurrection ritual the moment spelling disaster for all.Sommers' film is good fun in the long run. It is the sort of film that has its characters crack jokes and break one-liners in the face of an apocalypse, and in light of people formulating angry views on characters constantly outrunning explosions or things that they ought not be able to in films of this ilk, actually has a scene in which it sticks around to see what happens to the poor bastard unable to get away from the proverbial danger: the result is less than pleasant. The film is not without flaw, but it's difficult to get too angry over a piece as self-aware as The Mummy is of the old fashioned, spirited romp that it is. Look at the scene in which the protagonist even identifies his quest as one in which rescuing the damsel in distress; defeating the villain and saving the world must be achieved so as to attain parity, labelling it 'the usual'. With a well-sewn romance manoeuvred into the film and a great deal of threat persistently looming over proceedings; The Mummy is a decent, enjoyable little B-movie adventure which above most other things, is at least refreshingly honest.",6,1,3,30 March 2011
Troy," Certainly a cut above its director's usual forté of English language films, Troy isn't without serious flaw but sustains enough interest and drama to its conclusion.
","Wolfgang Peterson's Troy opens with a voice-over proposing to us as to whether or not famous tales; stories of bravery and bloody warfare; fables about the rise and consequent falls of famous nations, kings and civilisations and heroic, blood-thirsty warriors as well as their actions will ever be remembered or recalled over the ages - whether people will ask as to how what happened, happened. It would seem the answer is 'yes', but only if it's ever really distilled through the filter Peterson waters-down the tales of old he puts on screen here, and put out to a common-place audience in the manner that it is. If the aim of the film was to educate or inform or make those aware of the sorts of stories and content this piece puts to the screen, then Troy is ancient Greek mythology for the generation of social networkers; a three hour or so slog through warriors and their tirades, family affairs and love lives, a sweeping; scything; swooping film complete with overly dramatic delivery and the odd burst of orchestral music to emphasise drama and expansiveness. Provided with this in mind, it is a wonder that it at all works to the degree that it does.The film predominately covers two young men from two separate warring side as well as an awful lot in between. Eric Bana's Hector is a Prince to the higher-ups of Troy; a warrior but a politician and a philosopher as well as a mentoring figure to Orlando Bloom's Paris, his brother; Hector is a proud man, pleased that peace exists for the time being where he is based. Then there is Brad Pitt's Achilles, a fearsome warrior with long blonde locks and a stern expression; a man we first encounter in bed with a woman whom looks as if she might have just fallen out of a modern day centrefold shoot, a man effectively a mercenary-for-hire who's late for a large battle his employer, Brian Cox's Greek king Agamemnon, is about to instigate but negates any trouble with both his gyp and his unworldly ability to perform in a one-on-one fight. The situation these people and these kingdoms find themselves in is narrated orally to us in that manner that makes it sound like this is the most important tale you'll ever hear. Agamemnon, the power hungry tyrant, wants Troy and control of its surrounding area; mixed up amidst all of this is Brendan Gleeson's Menelaus, a man angry at those from Troy due to Paris' swiping of his wife Helen (Kruger), whom has fallen in love with Paris and has consequently eloped.Things escalate, with Achilles tempted into working with Agamemnon and his cronies of which include Sean Bean's (disapointingly cast as the grizzled 'tough-guy' once again and proving that 2007's Far North is the best thing he's done in a while) Odysseus, so much so that asking his mother for help merely sees her provide advice along the lines of: being famous and remembered throughout history beneath this mirage of 'celebrity status' is good; and lopping people's heads off for a living when you aren't driving swords trough their chests is a pretty decent way to go about attaining said status. The film, despite being set thousands of years ago, carries an annoyingly polished feel to it since there is very little grub and grime to proceedings, despite the unusually brave overall downcast nature Peterson applies to the material which was always ripe for that of being poorly played.The film is driven by rather beautiful, somewhat unrealistically photogenic people such as Pitt; Bana; Bloom and Kruger, each of whom come across as sympathetic as the film can possibly make them regardless of role and are in stark contrast to the older and wearier Gleeson and Cox whom are tyrannical, aggressive, all conquering and vengeful in a far uglier fashion. Achilles' gradual falling out with his king and employer Agamemnon sees Cox inform Pitt that 'no-body will remember him' as 'history only recognises the kings from centuries gone by' - information I'm not sure on what he's basing, since it was the actions of a fair few from around about this era which has gone on to spawn such thinking; not, with his dreams of stardom and fame, something Pitt wants to here. Their gradual falling out feels more-so symptomatic of this distinction the film makes between the 'young' and 'old' performers more than it does because two rounded characters are genuinely disagreeing.One cannot watch the film with a certain nagging sensation at the back of one's head, critical observations of 2000's Gladiator about how various feuds were instigated by way of trash-talking and calling one's opponent out alá a contemporary wrestling or boxing match rearing its head at specific points. There is some interesting material later on to do with Hector's battle he has with his council members more broadly linked to theology, proving the film can when it wants to have its 'pretty boy' leads fall foul of the elders therein on more substantial grounds when it wants to, but this sort of stuff is few and far between. Soap opera narrative aside and while it is generally allover the place, I was surprised by how much I came to be involved in the plights of its characters; Troy a war film with an eye on the more grandeur or scoped nature of battle but with an additional, more mature and more downcast eye on the love these characters have for one another behind the scenes. Very little is ultimately won in Troy but an awful lot is lost, and its perception of war as an ugly and terrible thing which does nobody any favours rings rather depressingly true when two supremely advanced nations are unable to come together and instead come to fight. Troy is a thoroughly mixed bag of tricks but one just about worth catching.",6,0,1,4 March 2011
Brokeback Mountain," The real tragedy may well be that what ever happened on Brokeback, was only ever allowed to stay on Brokeback.
","Much nearer the end of Brokeback Mountain when a revelation occurs, someone receives it from down a telephone. We do not see the revelation, we merely hear of it like another said character does. The film does not stop what it's doing and cut to the revelation in order to show us and it does not give us that experience of the films final action within its final act. Instead of showing us, it 'informs' us of the event and then allows us to come to terms with it in our own way. For a split second, we are the character on the phone nearer the end since as soon as they first hear of it, we do and that is the cue to accept. There is no glory and there is no obvious closure, just a scene 'about' a scene and that 'less is more' phrase works so, so well in this instance.One of many reasons Ang Lee picked up Best Director Oscar for Brokeback Mountain, I think. The film covers such a vast period of time and feels as epic as it looks and yet it probably never even expands beyond a radius of fifty miles. This is a film about a certain sort of person, living within a certain timeframe within a certain society. In decades from now people may well be labelling this as some sort of birth of the American period drama. The film absorbs its audience with a story about love and in some regards honour but also tells of the hardships and demands this (and every) society wishes upon its people. Throw in some brief nods to Freud's thinking that the film-maker's absolutely nailed; some interesting scenery; two dynamic acting performances and a narrative that is both unpredictable and unconventional and yet equally interesting and you have the ingredients for Brokeback Mountain.Right from the very off the film announces in a covert and unsuspecting manner that it will break away from convention. This is a love story people that inhabit the world in which both Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal) would call 'unconventional' at the very nicest and the film is anything but conventional. The archetype of the cowboy is one that has been set in stone for decades; that one of hard bodied, male, masculine and upstanding. Here the cowboys and the figure of the cowboy is rendered the opposite, homosexual. The men when we first see them are tentative, shy even. The early exchanges out on the mountain are awkward and somewhat unspectacular but the director allows his film to simmer; he allows his characters to develop and get a feel for their new surroundings before they enter a new lifestyle.Then there are the tiny details regarding both character's childhood and parents. A scene is set aside for Ennis to describe what happened to him and his parents when he was younger and I believe this lack of a father figure perhaps shaped the way his young mentality developed. Equally so, Jack's bedroom we learn was always kept like it was when he was a boy suggesting the parent's inability to move on; to develop and to ultimately let their son go Â– this can have serious repercussions on a young adults mindset. So these characters of Ennis and Jack are not mere pawns in a large, obligatory-laden and melodramatic game of chess but are indeed people written, expanded and then thought through with the question 'How did my characters get to this position in the first place?' But the film does not stop around about there. There are the others things to weigh up such as the fact both men sort of admit to one another that neither of them are, in fact, entirely homosexual. This scene comes as a bit of a surprise or perhaps it is included to make evident both men, despite what has happened, want to retain a certain 'butch' status. Maybe the writers including it says more about them as both men have respective scenes later on in their marriage where authority is stamped in a macho and 'typical' cowboy fashion: Ennis takes on and knocks down a rough looking guy at a fireworks display and Jack goes against his family in-laws in having on an American football game during dinner at the most heightened of situations.But these scenes do not occur sporadically as random passages of violence. Indeed, no cowboy in this film is going to punch someone so hard that they'll fly through a wall. The superegos omitted by Jack and Ennis happen only when their wives and children are present and either insulted or belittled Â– it is that un-denying feeling of love and/or affection that sparks the reaction and that is something that both men cannot control when they are together much later on in the film: they cannot control their affection for one another and react accordingly, most would say 'unconventionally'. It is ironic that a film loosely about a homosexual male couple would portray women in such a negative light. Most are seductive and do not wear much with others looking for mere foot massages and a flirtatious dance while one other is shown as one that keeps talking and in an unintelligent manner. For what it is, Brokeback Mountain is an intriguing unpredictable tale set in a world that would not accept its protagonists for what they are.",8,2,3,28 May 2008
Ed Wood," A fascinating look at a fascinating story behind a rather fascinating director; could in fact be called 'Plan 9: The Making Of'.
","'Ed Wood' is one of those films that comes really close to making fun out of itself. Its Hollywood, behind closed doors setting is something that has worked really well when exploited by certain films in the past, namely 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'The Player' and it works just as well here, setting up a big, intimidating world in which the characters try to live in and break through in. One person unfazed yet totally oblivious to the fact he's living under these conditions is our hero; Edward Wood which gives the film a comic touch straight away.If you're familiar with Edward Wood or if you've seen any of his films then it helps  big time. Although it's probably not necessary to have seen them all; the focus here is one what professional critics and analysers have dubbed 'the worst film ever made' that film being 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. I, myself, have seen the said movie and rated it 4/10, yes, it was bad what with the awful camera work, fake sets and props and woeful dialogue but to be honest; I've seen worse (Batman and Robin, anyone?).As I mentioned, the film gives off a fantastic look at Hollywood itself. The sets, the extras, the studios  they all combine to create an interesting utopia or dystopia for some. The references to Boris Karloff and the actual inclusion of Bela Lugosi and his problems is a wonderful sub-plot that really hammers home the authenticity of the film. Another interesting reference is when Wood (Fantastically acted by Depp) is talking to Lugosi (Again, brilliant acted by Landau) about the horror genre and Universal horror in general. They mention 'traditional horror' which utilises buildings, shapes and the like to create an atmosphere; something that 'Ed Wood' director Tim Burton actually does and can be seen in films such as 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'Batman Returns'.Because Edward Wood is supposedly the worst director of all time, we see film producers laugh at some of his work he presents them early on; not sure whether to laugh or not. This is an interesting, subtle hint at our own reaction. If we've seen any of Wood's work in real life (especially 'Plan 9') then we know how they feel; do we laugh or not. Is this meant to be serious film-making? This draws us in to the film and helps us relate to the producers.The films is packed full of references to previous Edward Wood films and we really can see his masterpiece 'Plan 9' forming as the film progresses. Each thing he picks up on, from the first sight of Vampira to the fact a random guy happens to look like Lugosi with half his face covered up. It's really engrossing cinema and it's interesting trying to figure out what's true to life and what isn't. In addition, if you've seen 'Plan 9', then the shooting of it on set is just fascinating.With some strong acting from everyone, even the supporting cast and some great content; 'Ed Wood' is, so far, my favourite biopic and is genuinely funny and entertaining. Although I hate to go away thinking this was merely exploiting the worst director of all time, I shall just suggest it's more of a warning of what not to do than anything else.",8,1,1,8 December 2006

Orphan," It'll be tough to find room in your life for this particular Orphan.
","Orphan plays out like a sort of sub-The Omen, sub-Domestic Disturbance (although with a nine year old girl fulfilling the Vince Vaughn role); generic thriller that has its jumps and its fun but isn't really up to much save for the advertising of the cinematographer's abilities and proof its director, Spaniard Jaume Collet-Serra, can string together a decent number of scares and set pieces. The film is, in fact, so ordinary that it requires a man to enter proceedings nearer the end dressed in a white lab coat so as to formally explain to us just what on Earth is going on - this is all just before the daft climax, wherein the adult leads fumble around in the pitch black as our villain of the hour negates precisely the same surroundings with consummate ease. At least Buffalo Bill had a set of night vision goggles.Orphan begins with a middle aged couple whose latest of three children doesn't make it beyond the birth stage. Shattered, with regular trips to therapy and a constant fight required to stave off the temptation to turn to drink, it has hit wife and existing mother Kate Coleman (Farmiga) hard. With her husband, Peter Sarsgaard's John, they hit upon adding to their double act of pre-existing infants through means of adoption so as to bury the misfortune. This means a trip to an orphanage and the picking out of a child who's already got some years on them; something that could bring with it some bother for this family of Lexus driving; piano playing; detached house owning unit in that with adoption, introducing an already abandoned, most likely troubled, child into the mix will bring with it its own set of challenges.Hark, for amidst the other kids who wallow in their charging around and shouting and such lies Esther (Fuhrman), the titular orphan and young girl who's able to meet the Coleman's status in that she philosophises and is greatly skilled in painting. She's calmer than the rest of the orphans; her elevated position in occupying the first floor of the orphanage suggests hierarchy above them and is generally perceived as the perfect selection. Alas, Esther brings with her back to the Coleman's house a terrifying secret; something that would be cruel to reveal given it's the one bright point of the film's runtime, a moment wherein the mind frantically peddles backwards so as to work out if all of the behaviour and such syncs up with where now find ourselves.In the meantime, she's free to frolic with the existing Coleman kids; two children in Dan (Bennett) and Max (Engineer), the latter of whom at this early stage of their life suffers with something that's perfect in how it is Esther will come to get her own way and, wouldn't you just know it, allows indelibly for the screenwriter to exploit the means by which Esther will come to royally screw with this family unit. Dan, the elder of the two existing siblings, is becoming aware of his own bourgeoning sexuality and has for himself a neat tree house 'perched' on a rickety tree beam. Sister Max, however, is deaf thus the sensory deprivation in both speech and sound will often make it tough for her to communicate to her parents when communication to her parents is exactly what's needed.The film comes to unfold in a sad world, a world wherein if you happen to know where Transylvania is, you're labelled a 'retard'. The look of the world is adeptly gloomy, the greys of winter in this leafy U.S. state syncing up nicely with how this family have befallen this tragedy, but the tone is too frivolous and mainstream for it to be an effective enough horror. The usual traits that often stand up to represent the bane of most modern horror are all here: the recklessness of the parents to share their love with one another in the most accessible of places: the kitchen, as Esther watches on; while John's later conversations with a flirtatious neighbour does little to blunt Esther's gradually desire to manipulate, exploit and ultimately ruin this family. Villains in these sorts of films often get what they want, and the supporting acts often aid them with their languid actions and things are no different here.We've seen this sort of material before, but those unfamiliar with the first Omen sequel, or perhaps even the Child's Play films, will not be impressed. The tale of a child bullied for being different, before realising they have a powerful characteristic over those around them - young and old alike, before thus deciding to go on a bit of a rampage, is almost certainly borrowed from 'Damien: Omen II' as bullies trigger this murderous entity who then creatively proceeds to pop anyone off who dares threaten their homicidal run. But hey, if you're into watching the latest mainstream slice of horror thriller fiction, wherein there are some jumps and some frights and a twist that does well to cover up the blandness of everything else, you might want to take Orphan home with you.",5,1,4,3 April 2013
Home Alone," Straining for our fondness and doing its best to try our patience on occasion, the film remains snappy and often funny enough in spite of its shortcomings.
","I didn't think George Romero's 1985 film Day of the Dead was the piece I was going to come away from Home Alone thinking about the most. Certainly, in terms of structure, there is that overriding sense of the first two thirds of the film acting as gentle 'filler' to the bigger picture; pleasant foundations easing into a final act arriving with such an explosion that when we watch it all unfold, we observe just how much craft and panache has been put towards it when placed up against mostly everything that preceded it. The respective sequences are, of course, when the undead run amok in what was up to that point a safe haven for the few remaining human beings left in the United States and that moment those two burglars in Chris Columbus' 1990 comedy Home Alone make it to the lead's house so as to ransack it.Up to these respective points, we could be forgiven for misplacing that said films were necessarily either respective horror or comedy movies at all. In the case of the Romero movie, that was OK: we enjoyed the clash between those indebted to science and those not; between those with trying to learn and understanding beings initially alien to them and those wanting to round them all up and get rid of them as soon as possible. In comparison, the build up to Columbus' explosion of style, craft and third act circumstance into which you genuinely feel the most energy has been pumped contains a scene in which one of those typically overweight American police officers goofily slips on a stretch of ice as he chases after an infant accused of stealing a toothbrush. Ho hum.In spite of this, Home Alone is a fairly resounding effort on the whole without really ever creeping above a certain threshold of meagerness. It is a child's film, for sure, and one they'll no doubt enjoy watching as the kid protagonist thwarts an array of grownups in both a physical and authoritarian sense. They'll sympathise with the lead and his marginalisation at the hands of uncles and brothers, and they'll respond to his predicament of actually being away from family members and parents whilst having to get by on one's own as the first and foremost source of adventure. Remarkably, the film works as well as it does from an adult perspective; child orientated goals aside, it is made with the best of intentions and competently enough in spite of the fact one can only hold a certain amount of sympathy for a young child wanting all the attention without getting it whilst disparagingly privy to a three storey house in a part of the world which always sees snow at Christmas time and with a family capable of affording expensive holidays to far off locales.It is Macaulay Culkin playing Kevin McCallister, an infant boy stuck at home at Christmas time with his extended family on the eve of their big holiday away to Paris. Kevin is an outcast, and both frustrates and is frustrated by them. One line, as he stamps up and down on the landing, as he shouts: 'When I grow up and get married, I'll finally be able to live alone!' captures his forthright but ignorant stance. After wishing them gone and he alone, the following morning sees a mad dash and a miscount resulting in the McCallister's halfway over the Atlantic and Kevin still in an attic convert. Cue a lot of shenanigans; a rush to get home to him and a passable framework to do with the lead's realising family are actually something to cherish. Proper antagonism arrives in the form of two burglars, Marv (Stern) and Harry (Pesci); a couple of crooks whose trademark is to fill the sinks of their victims and leave the taps on to induce flooding – rather humorously, they scope out neighbourhoods in a van kitted out to look like a plumbing company and as they 'toast' crowbars whilst spying the McCallister residence, an amusing cut to inside Kevin's house sees a TV cartoon broadcast depicting The Grinch: they are indeed out to wreck Christmas.The various strands and subplots just about hang together; Kevin's mother's sub-Planes, Trains & Automobiles trek back home, complete with an eccentric John Candy figure, is kicked around for laughs but just feels like John Hughes paying homage to himself, while Kevin's integration with a road sweep, whose psychosis ends up being a lot more balanced than was initially established, allows Kevin to see things through more grounded eyes. The road-sweep and our lead share a scene in a church which, quite literally, sees the conclusion of Kevin's framework all but verbally confirmed whilst revealing what it is he's come to learn during this experience - the following fifteen minutes a part of the final twenty seeing the film make that aforementioned step up into a final act of second unit genre onslaught when Marv and Harry finally try to rob the McCallister house. Where the narrative is weak with the whole exercise sporadically feeling spineless, its lead carries the film in a surprisingly diligent manner whereas composer Williams finds a delicate place in between unnerving, on account of some theremin riffs during the opening as a small home is dwarfed by the film's ominous 'Home Alone' title card, to reassuring and quite pleasant with a thoroughly competent score. Columbus keeps the thing cracking along at a brisk old rate, and while the wheels threaten to come off, it is actually somewhat of a relief overall that they do not.",6,0,2,2 February 2012
Terminator Salvation," Disappointing and somewhat underwhelming addition to a franchise that many, though excluding myself, exclaimed was dead anyway.
","I think a certain degree of trepidation hit everyone when it was announced the director of the two Charlie's Angels films would be at the helm for a PG-13 (12A in Britain) Terminator film that was going to go down new roads and take place in the future, during the actual war between man and machine. It has since come to my attention that the writers of this project worked on the 2004 film Catwoman, which should really be a further nail in the coffin before you've even walked in. I do not think Terminator Salvation is quite as bad as either of these prior projects, which suggests a certain progression in both the filmmakers and writers' body of work, but all that counts for just about nothing when we realise this is the Terminator franchise we're talking about here, and whoever's decision it was to opt for these people to execute these ideas, must now come to terms with the fact it was a bad one.If you know anything about the Terminator films, you'll know it is all about bodies – hard bodied cyborgs learning to become more humane and learning the values of human life; twinned with the soft bodied, deliberately introduced as rather pathetic, everyday-woman who learns of her fate and hardens up to become a fighter; a soldier and a mother. They are additionally about the coming to terms with technology and modernity co-existing in our contemporary world, and the struggles we face in being able to control what is essentially an arms race as these weapons are developed and developed some more. This addition, sadly, lacks any continuation of said study.Terminator Salvation is a bad film, those that say otherwise are, I think, allowing the fact it's a Temrinator film complete with a few mildly interesting action scenes, to blind them somewhat. But it's that 'annoying' bad you sometimes get with projects you go in really wanting to like. Some may even compare the experience to 1999's Episode 1 of the Star Wars saga. Initially, Terminator Salvation is told on two separate equilibriums. The first sees a cold-blooded criminal named Marcus Wright (Worthington) sign away his body to Cyberdyne Systems prior to execution, in 2003. Upon the happening of Judgment Day and the resurrection of Marcus, complete with his half human-half robotic body, he bumps into a young Kyle Reese, played by a Russian actor named Anton Yelchin. Events transpire that put Reese in mortal danger and force Marcus into meeting up with the man of the hour; the supposed saviour: John Connor (Bale).Prior to all this, Connor is heading various missions with members of the resistance in fully fuelled choppers and jet aircrafts; the sort that sees a few members die here and there, but nobody particularly important. Connor lives with a few significant members of the resistance; his wife Kate (Dallas Howard); an African-American soldier named Barnes (Common) and a feisty young woman whose study of a hard-bodied female soldier sees her glow on the screen, clad in a zip up tracksuit, whilst submitting to male charm in a false and disappointing manner that is crudely fast-tracked when a male agent saves her from potential rape. Her name is Blair Williams (Bloodgood).Director McG's heart isn't with this project. It seems we've come to a point in which entire projects are re-written and changed just prior to production because certain story developments and ideas are 'leaked' to the rest of the world. This is not an individual's vision; it is a studio's vision to deliver an experience that no one is expecting – and when people are expecting it, it is removed and changed and re-submitted; for sake people might not pay their money if they know what will transpire. The film attempts to open up a plot that the humans hope will culminate in the destruction of the machines; a plan that revolves around the idea that 'Every machine has an off switch, let's find Skynet's'. This is introduced by a certain General Ashdown (Ironside), a man that states, after finding a low frequency noise that deactivates the machines, that the humans can win this war with this tool. Trouble is, we all walk in knowing there are planned sequels so there is never really any tension as to whether this plan will work – clearly it won't, and sure enough, a development opens up towards the end that told me I was correct in my feeling vacant.The final act is completely phoned in, what with a descent into the baddies' lair, crudely put across via lazy iconography consisting of towering, grey chimneys and large vents that inexplicably shoot out fireballs at random intervals. The film transpires into a pretty basic one-on-one showdown in which metal rods, electric cables and tanks of molten steel are readily available – McG has no awareness of space during these scenes and as a consequence, it is horridly put together. Getting there is a chore; McG rips off Spielberg's War of the Worlds with large, hulking, bleeping robots that collect humans in cages for selected further use but gives us a few new, if rather dull, Terminator motorcycles plus reconnaissance bots that look a bit like Frisbees. Where the franchise goes from here, I don't know. All that can be done is the documentation of how Kyle got sent back to 1984 or how the development and production of the T-1000 model came about. These ideas are nothing but mere visualisations of previously unseen events and will offer nothing bar a 'kick' as we see what we've never seen before effectively play out – I ask you: for what? The franchise may not be Terminated just yet, but it's on a bumpy old road to some sort of ruin.",5,0,2,5 June 2009
Insomnia," Solid film with numerous basic stand out aspects such as acting, cinematography and script but it does do a little more than you think.
","I'm not sure what surprised me more, the fact that this was actually a remake of a Scandinavian film or the fact that deep down, Insomnia is a really smart and classy thriller. There are so many examples of thrillers from recent years that get into a groove of good guy, bad guy, love interest and rely on their special effects and stunts to pull it home. In Insomnia, these things are toyed with a little and what with a few other well made and thought through conventions, it makes Insomnia rather enjoyable.After you get the customary set up which reminded me of The Silence of the Lambs what with the police agent acting as a fish out of water (Academy to the Frontline in The Silence's case  Los Angeles to freezing, backwater town in this case) brought in to track a murderer whilst having the plot involve a rookie female of some sort. What's clever here is that we know as much as the police do from very early on but as secrets and situations arise, the path we go down with Will Dormer (Pacino) is as decisive as it is enthralling. Insomnia is a really well shot film  its use of the Alaskan setting through long, external shots and the way it portrays inside settings as so 'in-between' light and dark are really good. The fact the town he's in is almost always engulfed by light at the time of his visit acts as a fabulous device.Where Insomnia breaks away from the standard thriller is when it toys with the prospect of role reversal. After Dormer gets a call from Walter Finch (Williams) who's assumed to be a murder suspect since it was him running from a set up and it was him who has 'one up' on Dormer for events you'll discover, the film moves into a period of about thirty minutes revolving around Finch proving his 'innocence' that the death was an accident and Dormer becoming more and more besieged by guilt and the blackmail Finch has on him. It's almost as if Finch is now the OK guy and Dormer is the one who has done bad and this is emphasised through the way he sees the world: he's starting to see everything in a distorted manner, he's having to tidy up his mistake by covering his tracks; something a murderer would have to do as well as come up with alibis. He's also failing to sleep at night and at one point is mocked by Finch for 'breaking his record'. This is Dormer entering the killer's mindset and it's done really well, having an interesting spin on things.I suppose the reason Insomnia's such a well made and effective thriller is that its director is Christopher Nolan who pays attention to fine detail. The way the editing becomes a little erratic and you could say 'slack' but I think it's for a reason  heads are in different positions as reverse shots are displayed during conversations (like on the ferry) and it becomes quite abrupt, emphasising the lack of sleep Dormer's had. Like I said, the film does play around with who's 'good', who's evil and who's being pinned as evil when really maybe they're not and Hilary Swank's character of Ellie Burr is perhaps a little more than a supporting character when you think about it. Despite all the manipulation, the 'order' is eventually restored so that felt a little disappointing as I felt the film set itself up nicely for a twist of some sort.Make no mistake, Insomnia is well made and has made me curious as to what the original is like. I can just imagine Stellan Skarsgård running around an icy Scandinavian country dealing with the things that happens in this narrative. For maximum effect, watch the film late at night when you've got that feeling that you just know you'll be tired in about an hour and half but you start the film anyway.",7,0,0,4 September 2007
My Neighbor Totoro," Not especially interesting, but it carries with it a positive ethic even if it's little more than an animated aside.
","My Neighbour Totoro is a sweet, pleasing little romp; an animation with some colourful landscapes and sweet, likable child leads whose frolicking and sheer bounce are often the engine room to the film's otherwise empty sense of energy. Sadly, and for all its plaudits, the film comes off as ultimately a bit of an inconsequence - it isn't exciting, nor particularly memorable: there is little conflict; little drama and the film is extraordinarily light on narrative and character. If I told you the film was about a child encountering monsters given these things, you might raise an eyebrow. However, if I told you the monsters, instead of being scary, were themselves scared of an energetic, boisterous human presence then you might be able to put two-and-two together in that the animation is less interested in delivering the generic thrills and spills that come with such a premise and more interested in exploration and revisionism. That's fine, of course; but when the charm of such an idea has worn off and the approach to have it both ways in its grounded depiction of a dramatic reality (alá Ocean Waves or Only Yesterday) mixed with fruiter, more escapist Ghibli fare driven by encounters with odd animals, we are not left with much in which to get interested nor with which to stay invested.At its heart is a tale of a young child meeting creatures not of this world, but the creatures are more interested in catching up on sleep than anything else. They meet, hang out, learn to be in one another's presence, get along fine and that's the end of it. This is, of course, only to a face value; look deeper and you'll see that this is a film about a child being brave in the face of new surroundings; of learning how to act in the company of strangers; of accepting predicaments and, it seems, coming to quite enjoy eating one's vegetables.Two playful young sisters named Satsuki and Mei are in the process of moving into a new home with their father in decades-ago Japan, an abode in the country; secluded and rural. Their existence is happy, jovial; they are easily excited and very enthusiastic in their nature. Upon arrival, there are some relatively uninteresting frolicking around; the kids get wind of would-be real/unreal creatures that already occupy the premises: little grey sprites that live in the walls and dart about when no one's looking out of fear of the fresh human occupants. This allows the film to play with a child's fear of the dark; their gradual discomfort of being in a new space and the sense of excitement abound with all these things combined as exploration beckons, and we're never sure if horror or soft-core adventure is the order of the day here. It's both – on occasion not either. Whatever the choice, rarely does the film feel like it's going anywhere or with the aspiration to truly take off.The kids lack a mother. She rears up out of the blue later on, in an ill-advised manner when it's revealed she's suffering from depression. It's here the issues with the overall approach to My Neighbour Totoro rear up, since it was never that sort of film in the first place, and I find it difficult not to resent the piece for dragging us down that path when the whole subplot arrives. At the core of it lies a friendship Mei strikes up with the titular Totoro, her 'neighbour' as it were, in that he lives nearby just beyond the bushes and undergrowth of the gardens. Totoro is an animal not of this world; a sort of egg shaped creature who looks a little like a rabbit but is about as big as a small tree He sleeps. He sleeps a lot. He says very little, and is enormous, but appears friendly in spite of the fact he could fit all of Mei inside of his mouth.Where he is docile, she is this continuous presence of excitement and activity but the film cannot muster up much excitement or interest when these two of such a binary opposition come together. In spite of the character's inherent lack of anything at all that may be interesting, it hasn't stopped the companies shipping millions of Totoro die-cast toys; this is in spite of him essentially being someone so uncharacteristic, and so dull in their existence, that I'm hard pressed not to say they are the most lifeless, least likable Ghibli character I can think who's of a supernatural sort. Totoro has his obligatory access to all sorts of magic and friends and avenues to adventure, and Mei comes to interact with them. They fly around and plant seeds and everyone has fun. At least, it looked like they did. The film carries on. Everyone's getting along fine; no one believes Mei: of course they don't, although the father finds room to play along with the fantasy. The whole thing is sufficient, innocuous nonsense that's ultimately too childish to explore the darker passages inherent in within it, and too inconsequential to motivate much interest in the central fantasy tract.",6,1,4,20 March 2013
Juno," More delirious, American cinematic insights into delicate situations and/or mindsets; this time brought to you under a faux umbrella of the 'quirky'.
","What's more annoying than a low budgeted; dialogue heavy; 'quirky' independent film featuring young performers of whom don't come across as even trying that hard? Answer is: a low budgeted; dialogue heavy; 'quirky' independent film featuring young performers, of whom don't come across as even trying that hard, which every one, and I mean every one, likes apart from yourself. Maybe it's just me; maybe I just cannot connect with films like Juno, although my track record with quaint, somewhat dainty, introverted independent films set amidst no-where towns whilst revolving around people you feel COULD exist but probably don't isn't that bad, as I was rather a fan of Lars and the Real Girl, but Juno is a straw of some sort of finality.Here we have a film that stomps you into the ground in its demand you enjoy it; an experience so misguided and all over the place, a film that likes to think is grounded within the boundaries of realism but in actual fact is practically taking place in an alternate universe; a film that it is impossible to invest time and effort into, with people equally impossible to watch without squirming in your seat. Juno takes place in the cut off nether-regions of Minnesota in America; a place so isolated and scary in the sorts of people that inhabit it and what they get up to, that it makes a time spent away in the icy command post Russell and co. inhabited in 1982's The Thing, look desirable. Juno takes place in a world in which people name their children things like 'Liberty Bell'; it unravels in a place in which middle aged men name their acoustic guitars; it unfolds in a place in which if you arrived there, you'd want to get the Hell back out again after spending no more than five minutes in the company of any of the characters we engage with.Ellen Page plays the titular role, a very young and very pregnant girl whom lives with her parents; goes to a high school; drives; visits the mall and interacts with her friends in the most excruciating ways it is possible for American, high school girls to do so on screen. The film is quick to establish the juxtaposition of a seemingly perfect family set up with the scenario of a teenager in a less-than desirable situation.On one of the first times we see her, she sits on the concrete steps of her house and a certain Paulie Bleeker (Cera) jogs by in his running gear. She gazes at him, and catches a glimpse of certain parts of his body through his gear. Problem is; if the gender roles had been reversed here, and it had been told through a male perspective under this false, pretentious umbrella of quaint and quirkiness in a world that doesn't exist; and the character that runs by had been female, there'd probably be an uproar. It's feminism gone mad, and I'm all for feminism – I think this 'high school comedy' sub-genre has had some dismal efforts of late, what with films like Superbad; films that take the male perspective and just deliver totally out of order tails about how women exist and should be treated, but Juno is so mind numbingly, bash-your-head-against-the-wall annoying in its dainty atmosphere and false, romanticised approach to a subject matter completely ill suited to the aesthetic Juno is aiming for, that it has to be considered as frightening as things like Superbad, only for different reasons.So where do we go from here; well, her parents/guardians/whoever find out and Juno hits on the notion she will give the baby up for adoption. But, to whom? Why, the equally quirky/dainty/flimsy/cooky (any adjective ending in 'y', sounds like 'e') middle-class couple Mark (Bateman) and Vanessa (Garner) Loring! How inspired. Given the subject matter, the film comes across as a soppy and oddly harmless piece that I think very much underestimates its subject matter, and the Boring family's (sorry, I meant 'Loring' family's) attitudes are the visual representation of the film's burning problem: 'What do we want to do?'; 'How do we want to do it?' 'Am I (Are we) doing the right thing here?'. The film's secondary study, twinned with its overall failings, revolves around indecision.As characters, Garner's Vanessa is infuriatingly annoying. She comes complete with an energetic characteristic which just makes her constantly pressing and persistent twinned with the fact her smile, teeth and ear-bleedingly tinny, 'nails-down-a-blackboard' voice do nothing for you as you attempt to invest time and emotion with these people and predicaments. Juno even feels the need, out of nowhere and rather ill-advised in my opinion, to break off into some sort of creepy, would-be relationship between the titular character and Mark, with whom they frequently branch off into tired, meandering, uninspiring and frankly quite dull passages of talk about popular music.So the film ponders and wades on, complete with drippy soundtrack and with a generally wet feel to it all. There's a scene at a shopping mall in which, if there was a little light in the corner of your screen, it would begin blinking to let you know moral choices; decisions and responsibility etc. is about to be played out, when Juno sees a mother and child very much enjoying one another's company and, you know what? Juno thinks; she ponders and asks herself some questions about really wanting to give it away – where everyone takes a collective sigh, I take a collective breath as I hold in pent-up rage. As what Juno really wants is called into question, so to is what the would-be foster parents really want, both in a sequence that will end with the rug being yanked out from under our feet, in a highly annoying manner. I found Juno a stroppy, laborious experience that was frequently painful and consistently frustrating.",5,2,7,5 August 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," A brave attempt, but it falters with the story and other basic film principals
","The Day After Tomorrow is a rather entertaining film which combines good CGI and character development and mixes them up into a film containing elements of a rather delicate subject; namely global warming.Unfortunately, the CGI and character development is all that this film has going for it when it comes to the basic principals of good film-making. The whole 'moral message' about the global warming and stoppage of environment destroying is made very obvious, very early on. This is rammed into our faces with some very disorientating montage sequences, very early on in the film with various natural disasters occurring through out the world. From the beginning, we are immediately shown some of the flaws this film has. It moves from one thing to the next at a confused pacing and annoying things like this crop up at various intervals.The early montage scenes, as I've mentioned, are very sudden. There is no real build up to these scenes; it's just random hail in Japan amongst other things in other places. Here, a bit of character build up would have worked so that we can sympathise with the people going through hell thanks to the weather, but there isn't any so we don't really care that much and this detracts from the experience. Another thing is the editing, which is sloppy. I can understand shaky camera work in a moment of panic and chaos but only if it's from someone's point of view. In this scene, it's just blurred and too chaotic to even notice/care what the hell is happening. Some patience and some build up would have worked.Another thing is that the initial disaster of the tornados around L.A happens a little too early on for me. The film makers were probably a little eager to show off the CGI, but they had the chance to do that with the earlier scenes, of which they could have executed a little better. Here, it seems L.A. is eliminated and just brushed aside for the rest of the film in an odd message from the director consisting of: 'Right, here's the shock and awe of the weather in this film. Something as big as L.A. is gone so forget about it'. We don't find out what happens in the aftermath and in the end, the whole attack probably didn't even need to happen to advance the film; as I said - it was merely a show off.During the bulk of a film, especially a thriller like this one, you need some suspense or build up. In The Day After Tomorrow, there isn't any. One half of the characters in the film are attempting a rescue mission, the other half are staying in the same place for the entire film. That's not going to work. The only real fight the hero(s) have is the chase on the large boat against the wolves which floats into the city, in fact the wolves, in their brief appearance, are actually more of a match for the hero(s) and are more 'frightening' than the weather is.So, you get the idea that this film is rather slow in the middle and after a good beginning (bar the ridiculous early montages) it falters further and further before stumbling over the finish line with a bit of a silly ending. The character development is good but with the un-thrilling middle this film has, that's all the characters CAN do: talk. One good thing that this has through out is the CGI. Right from the beginning, the opening track shot of the ice glazier leaves you guessing whether or not it's actually real! and this momentum and consistent superior CGI is maintained through out, rivalling that of other releases of around this film's time that contain CGI, so at least it's good to end on a positive note.",6,3,6,16 June 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Disgrace not only to the genre of action/adventure but to film as a whole - time for the masses to actually watch some 'real' films.
","Despite not liking the first film and not even seeing the second, I thought I'd try and at least give the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film a chance; even if the odds were stacked against it. As it turned out  try as I might; it would've taken an effort that goes beyond the description of 'mammoth' for me to actually like this film  cinema viewing or no cinema viewing.Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is an absolute mess; it's an abomination and an insult to film as a whole. It manages to give the term 'summer blockbuster' a bad name which is, in truth, a new filmic low. The film is loud, over the top, messy, far too 'twisty and turny' and drags on and on and on to the point where you just don't care any more  you literally stop caring as to what's going to happen and this is a shame as the visually spectacular final fight scene is wasted  you can't have a fantastic sandwich if the bread is great but the filling is two weeks out of date.In Pirates of the Caribbean, (or Pirates 3 as it's also known) we are 'treated' to scenes in which the characters talk about absolutely nothing, people betray and backstab others before forgiving them and making up without so much as an eyebrow flinch and the actual structure of the film for the first two hours at least consists of: 1. Scenes involving Swann (Knightly) and Turner (Bloom) and their romance that seems like it will never happen given their missions in the film; 2. Jack Sparrow's (Depp) seemingly unreal foray into some sort of purgatory in which he acts like he's in a dream state and sees things that are psychically impossible. And, 3; the scenes chopping back to the un-dead sailors that are headed by Davy Jones (Nighy) and their uneasy truce with the British soldiers. First of all, two hours of this formula: '1,2,3; 1,2,3; 1,2,3' tests you  it really, really tests you. It tests your interest, your patience, you ability to even care and very quickly, I found myself completely detached to what was going on.Second, if all those crabs that carried Sparrow's boat from the desert and into the sea were made to look like they were in his mind, how is it possible for the others stranded on the beach to see it happen? This is an example of Pirates 3 breaking reality and just using the impossible as an excuse to either fill up time, instigate action scenes or crack dumb jokes. Un-dead, fish-like sailors I can take but things like this make you laugh at the film.This brings me onto the humour. No line of dialogue in this film made me laugh. Quite a few people around me in the cinema laughed but it really wasn't funny  I have to question whether it is me or them that has a problem. I like to think I have a sense of humour but this was really bottom of the barrel stuff. The only time I laughed was when a dwarf fires a musket, can't take the blowback and thus flies backwards. Some others laughed too, but what made me think afterwards was that we were all laughing at someone's disability and inability to do something  like laughing at a guy with really small arms trying to light a cigarette or something.Other things I hated: Keith Richards' appearance which acted a blatant attempt at a pop-culture reference (I expect about 70% of people watching this film wont even know who he is), the fact the film plays out like a cartoon more than a film, the fact the film can't decide if it's going to include violence or cut away just as something happens, the way Calypso's subplot of being freed was even included (she's not the focus, we don't see enough of her to give a damn) or about the fact a wedding ceremony takes place at the most inconvenient of times.If you like loud, overblown action sequences that have characters defy gravity  you'll absolutely love the end fight scene but I was just begging for it to end. One last thing: mid way through the film a character says to the other about Sparrow: 'Do you think he plans these things or makes it up as he goes along?' I was thinking the same thing about the screenwriter.",4,3,6,25 May 2007
X-Men," Despite its shortcomings, X-Men makes for reasonably interesting viewing with spits and spots of various character plus story elements combining in an obtuse fashion.
","Structurally, X-Men is all over the shop. Its building, brooding hour and a half of character and conflict is stretched out to an awkward length during which things unfold, but sporadically before having everything land at an overall 'base' in which a finale of good vs. evil can predictably play out. But the getting there is enjoyable enough, if a little scattered and episodic; the fun the film has with its lead refraining from taking either side, even though there are those in one camp so desperately wanting him to join them, keeps the film from descending too quickly into that aforementioned battle. Small, relatively inconclusive sub-plots bulk up the runtime and make us feel more gets done that perhaps does; the sense of the franchise being set up is certainly prominent in this first edition in flirtations and meek romance between characters; rivalries between others as well as an entire back-story shared between the two most powerful characters in the whole film is only hinted at, but not fully explored. Regardless, from its muddy and grotty opening during which an individual who's rendered an outcast by a superior force suffers at the hands of human beings, right the way up to its climatic fight on Liberty Island during which a similarly desired extermination of a 'race' must play out; the 2000 film X-Men, an adaptation of a comic book series of the same title, works.We begin with, mercifully, one of the film's very few expositional moments during which an American senator explains to a crowded room just what the mutants are and what threat they may or may not pose, the the view being to take away their right to hide as mutants and make themselves known. We're in, and, like everyone in that room, informed on what everyone is and the general proceedings. Later on, we get a sense of how important this issue is to everyone when the item is placed relatively high up on the United Nations' mandate at their annual meetings. The film provides us with a lead in the form of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, a mutant with the power of invulnerability of which many will rightly point out there is usually little to no peril when revolving a text around an indestructible lead, although he does come with a sort of secondary 'power' in the form of indestructible metallic blades which shoot out of his knuckles when provoked. Wolverine come across like Clint Eastwood came across as Blondie; complete with gruff voice and nary a cigar too far away so as to easily light up and chomp down on a fresh one now and again, in the process struggling to find much compassion and rarely ever being anything but cynical of what or who might be around him. His introduction, after the brief political speech, sees him forebodingly dominate his human counterparts in the outback of Canadian snowy nowhere as he persists in winning tavern-set cage wrestling matches. In providing us with Wolverine as a lead, we are spared having the film revolve around someone ready to accept his role as a mutant and thus are granted the chance to observe an arc dedicated to coming to terms with one's identity on top of future ideas linked to where one comes from.The leader of a large proportion of mutants is a certain professor named Charles Xavier (Stewart), whom has set up a base disguised as a school for the gifted in order to bring in young mutants so they may learn more about their powers and how to control them. Under his tenure, Cyclops (Marsden); Storm (Berry) and a certain Jean Grey (Janssen) have prevailed; the mutants on this side of the ideological fence retaining generally 'normal', human-like features in their basic appearance and that each of them are either very handsome or rather attractive in general, as they, complete with Xavier, inhabit this rather beautiful, isolated locale of an academy. On the other side, Ian McKellen's Magneto inhabits a very dark, dingy base of operations with his office taking on a very ugly, metallic, cubist form while his minions are these abnormal creatures whom carry disfigured, scarred bodies in the likes of hulking Sabretooth (Mane); an ugly, blue lizard-type shape shifting creature named Mystique (Romijn) and the, well, toad-like mutant named Toad (Park). Despite being a victim of a proposed purification himself as a young boy at the Nazi death camps, it is Magneto's goal to himself purify human beings as mutants so a more 'developed' species can take over, before we supposedly wipe them out; a kind of rooted hatred of humanity after what happened all those decades ago. It's an interesting move from director Singer to ask us to root against this character, given what we saw him suffer through at the beginning.The fitting element to the conclusion, during which a U.N. meeting is taking place in New York City and Magneto wants to 'mutantanise' the members, is that the final fight unfolds on The Statue of Liberty; itself a piece of iconography symbolising liberation; freedom and freedom of choice – the key thing being that Magneto is out to sabotage these things in reaction to the popular pass that mutants must surrender their own freedom of choice to remain in the dark. We only need to be told once where the fight is unfolding, and a number of exterior shots during this climax only serve to emphasise the point. At its worst, X-Men is the equivalent of watching a series of slightly interesting battles between expensive action figures giving a makeover by way of a computer, as numerous dead-end sub plots worm their way to nowhere; but these complaints minor and rarely happen. At its best, it's an interesting and genuinely fun romp about, at the most, three conflicting ideologies during which oneupmanship is the rollicking order of the day.",6,0,0,21 July 2010
Resident Evil: Extinction," I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Despite looking so, this series is not extinct just yet.
","I think Resident Evil: Extinction elevates itself slightly higher than its two predecessors and slightly higher than I thought it would in general. On one hand, it is a series of bizarre and somewhat illogical events that transpire under the scenario of an apocalyptic event's aftermath but on the other, it is a pastiche of 'zombie' films gone by; a crude study of one man's obsession with his research and a somewhat guilty action film. I liked Resident Evil: Extinction a little more than others of its type because it gives us more of a sedate look at the situation rather than a mere exploitation of special effects, attractive heroines and needless gore. Yes, it's true to say that this film has action scenes of a silly nature but they do not seem as stupid as previous Resident Evil films in which the protagonist is able to use kung-fu on dogs and make impossible shots to defeat her foes.The action scenes here are paced better and do not rely on the mere visualisation of actually seeing a Licker monster or Nemeses himself as the reason to keep watching. The enemies here are unspectacular and familiar and all the better for it; we get the feeling this is more of a survival film about the beasts and beings that would actually be out there rather than dumb scenes that try to impress us with a mentality: 'Look, a Licker.' or 'Look, this is what Nemeses would look like in reality.'. In the film, there is a scene in which several zombies come charging out of a metal crate. The scene works on the level of realism within the film because the film could so easily have substituted them for a larger, more visually impressive enemy that would've sufficed for the following action scene.I mentioned the word 'realism' in that paragraph, perhaps crazily so. But Resident Evil: Extinction takes time to present its heroes, all of whom travel in a procession of large vehicles, with every day issues that would affect them. Things like 'how much fuel is left? Where is the nearest petrol station?'; 'Where is the next meal coming from?' and 'How can we bed down for the night safely and free from attack?' These sorts of questions were lost in the previous films and are empty from other recent post-apocalyptic horror/sci-fi films like Blade: Trinity. Additionally, when the film does reveal its particularly large scale monster for the film's climax it does so in an effective manner. This is because we have had the monster and the source for the monster presented to us on another plot line. We get a feeling that it may happen within the world of the film unlike when Nemeses popped up in the last film merely because he's had the injection and must now just keep destroying stuff until he meets the hero for the finale fight.Although it takes on the matter of the pacing and the clarity of the action scenes, Resident Evil: Extinction is still guilty of one or two things. The film actually begins in a manner than had me dreading it would be as bad as the previous two. Alice (Jovovich) meets some human survivors but discovers them oddly unfriendly which acts more of a surprise than a dramatic twist. It's a scene in which implied prior victims have been conned, raped and then fed to the dogs; in this case infected dogs and sure enough Alice finds herself in the said situation  a sequence of events that plays out in a daft manner that reminds you of the prior films. It had me thinking 'how do the renegade survivors lock the infected dogs up for next time once they've had their fun?' Then there was the rather careless scene in which Alice falls asleep in the middle of the desert, at night and with the fire still burning  not smart considering the situation. The film is also disappointing in the sense that when the procession of vehicles housing the characters Alice, they are spread evenly in ethnicity and attitude meaning each individual 'type' could be killed off accordingly.But for the best part, Resident Evil: Extinction is a surprisingly enjoyable film with an interesting set-up and I was really quite fond of the story running parallel involving Dr. Isaacs (Glen) and his research in developing the un-dead, albeit a clear reference to Dr. Logan in Day of the Dead. This plot line runs alongside the development of the convoy and the situations they must deal with, the thing I like here is that these people are not world savers; they will not go on a cause and effect fuelled story and make all the un-dead disappear, they are just there to survive and through Alice their goal is to make it to the icy regions of Alaska.The bizarre thing about this latest Resident Evil instalment is just how good it might've been had it cut the action scenes down a little and tidied up the opening twenty or so minutes. It is disappointing that the convoy is made up of a Redneck (who's naturally good at sniping); an Aussie; two African-Americans; a Mexican and a wise-talking white American, all of whom exist for zombie fodder at the end of the day but this film instils me with hope that perhaps the films can be as good as the games  in the games, ammunition was a very sacred thing and the tactic of running from enemies rather than shooting them was a good one. In the films, the producers are gradually realising this and the next film may well surprise a few people in terms of how watchable it actually is.",6,18,33,1 August 2008
Zodiac," Gripping and fascinating without having to bombard you with special effects or cheap gimmicks.
","How pleasant it is to have a film like Zodiac be released during a time in which masses of computer generated imagery, sequels to films made years ago and out and out star power are the reasons to flock to see films. Releasing Zodiac in May, just before or perhaps right at the beginning of the summer rush for blockbuster supremacy was a very bold move and regardless of how it did, it will be one of the best films of the calendar year with possible Oscar nominations ready in waiting.Zodiac is a detective story that won't quit revolving around a non-detective who wont quit and also features a police detective who does sort of quit but then wants to help the non-detective for good measure. Zodiac's also a number of other things; it's someone's life story as they start out in a job at a newspaper, meet people, get married and have children; it's also a horror film of sorts with the murdering of teenage couples forming the basis of the shocks but it's a modern horror without the stupid teens basically sealing their fate since it's the killer who hunts them down rather than them putting themselves in venerable positions. The film is also an absolute lesson in cinematography amongst the acting, script and pacing since not only does it all look and sound good but you can look deeper into what we're seeing and hearing. An example of this is when a bloody rag is held up as evidence and the cheater exclaims that it's 'a window into his soul.' What's relevant here is that the rag is covered in black stripes making it look like a barred window you get in jails  it may be a window metaphorically but for the time being, it's a window that's cut off.We are spared any pleasantries involving Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal) who's a cartoonist at a San Francisco newspaper and instead get the gist of things of who he is through lighting and overall character. Gyllenhaal acts really well which is one thing but another is the fact that whenever Graysmith is on screen from the beginning, the 'introductory' phase, the light is very bright and revealing almost creating an angelic, innocent persona as opposed to everyone else's where the lighting is dark and grim; one such exempt time is when Graysmith is in the bar with the detective on the case: the lighting is bleak in the bar and yet the drink that arrives in front of Graysmith is light blue with umbrellas and a straw, keeping the theme running up to this point, at least. Of course; when Graysmith gets more involved, things change.Despite being called Zodiac and masquerading as a film revolving around San Francisco's notorious killer, the film dabs in and out of the killer's story and uses it as more of a backdrop than anything. This is nothing like Fincher's previous serial killer film Se7en in the sense it isn't two guys trying to crack a case of murder and confusion. The murder scenes are well done and the following phone calls add an eerie amount of realism, if the calls were real then all the more credit because it all works well when combined with the call to the television centre particularly standing out. Likewise, the demise of a certain character's overall life is embedded nicely into the story as we see everything from one man's point of view as we do with Graysmith's marriage and its tension.Interestingly, the final third of the film doesn't so much focus on the capturing of the killer as any other film would because this was based on real events and in the real world, it would seem that the good guys don't always win. Needless to say, Zodiac has never actually been caught but the film plays out like an aftermath of the infamous events that happened in the 1960s and 70s yet doesn't wander down familiar, cops and robbers territory like, say, Red Dragon (2002) did where loose ends are tied up and twists occur. Zodiac is gripping and involving in its own way and is a film that will surely have a better chance of withstanding the test of time than other films released these days.",8,2,4,22 October 2007
Milk," Wonderful film; to be embraced for its study of an outsider trying to get his voice heard during a somewhat increasingly volatile time.
","I think it's pretty fair to say, right at the beginning of this, that the man whose story it is we focus on in this film is dead. I know sometimes there's that conflicted sense of not wanting to know an awful lot about a famous individual going into a biopic all about them, particularly their fate, but in this case of Harvey Milk; who's the focus of Gus Van Sant's film from last year entitled Milk, everything is laid out in black and white very early on dispelling any doubt on whether the experience would be less-satisfying had you not known. Van Sant wants you to know he died a death in 1978, and he has every confidence in his execution of those final eight years of Milk's life that will make for an engaging and frightening experience anyway. The pleasing thing is, Van Sant is right on the money in this regard as his film is wonderful.Here is a Van Sant biopic we can cherish more-so we can despise or get frustrated at. Given the man's previous film was the sporadically received Last Days, which was again a film about a real person and documented their eventual downfall, or decline, into death of some description – you'd be forgiven for going into Milk with some doubts, particularly if you didn't take to the mumbling, sophomoric, and symbolist driven 2005 feature. Milk gives its subject room to breath, eight years worth in fact, and tells the story of an everyday guy who hadn't quite yet found his niché in life, but at forty years old, is still on the hunt. Going into the project, Van Sant had a lot to digest. His looking at a very specific period in a famous individual's life echoes what he did in Last Days with Kurt Cobain (supposedly), but the eight years out of forty-eight he observes here means that encompassing two relationships with separate male lovers; a power-house nation coming to terms with minority based people garnering strength and power through politics and a general making up of history as he went along on Milk's behalf are wonderfully captured and delivered with enough emotional and dramatic weight to label it a success.The titular role is played by the Oscar winning Sean Penn, a small but optimistic character who enjoys jumping head first into situations and predicaments no matter how seemingly dangerous or potentially hostile they might be. Milk is established as a man without much fear; the opening newsreel footage reporting his assassination sees the film jump straight into a very private and intimate moment in Harvey's life as we observe him recording his life story on a cassette tape which is, on his strict instruction, only to be played when he is dead – something that it seems Harvey is suspecting might be quite soon. It's an early example, indeed in the first scene, of Harvey confronting doubt and potential disaster head-on without shying away. Later on, he will receive death threats in the form of crude drawings displaying harm and mutilation of his person; but while those close to him panic, Milk faces facts and accepts people won't like him, indeed he seems to want to engage back with the perpetrators – criticising the pictures for lacking subtlety and humour but praising for effort none-the-less.The film is mostly a look at equality, and how most of those whose views and opinions on others restrict equality pushing through to become universal. Harvey Milk is just another guy attempting to make good with an American dream infused ideology, the fact that he's homosexual and involved in politics shouldn't matter – if the man is charismatic and people enjoy what it is he has to say in regards to his ideas, there ought not be a problem. Like every other working individual in America at that time, Milk is attempting to go bigger and better in a chosen career; a career he stumbles into when he and his then lover Scott Smith (Franco) move to San Fransisco from New York City and Milk becomes involved in gay activism. Harvey's predicament sees him forced into taking a position on the outskirts of society because of what he is and everyone's attitudes to what he is, while observing everything play out makes for genuinely interesting viewing. He is living his own American Dream after stumbling into his field of expertise and will not let anyone stop him from giving it a try.As an individual working within a choice of career in which your opinions and the manner in which you get them across depends on whether you, as a lone individual, succeed or not; Penn plays Milk less-so an extrovert or a show off, but a really charismatic and warm individual who just seems to talk sense. The film finds room to encompass Milk's romantic relationships running along side his more professional ones, but neither ever really detract nor distract from the other as the political work begins to overpower his home life; this in turn takes its agonising toll. Van Sant treats a lot of the more sensitive material with the greatest of respect, and that sense you're viewing a period in this man's life through that proverbial microscope as things go from strength to strength during which a man finds his form is fascinating. Certainly a film not to be missed.",8,0,2,11 December 2009
The Prestige," Near-enough to magical; Nolan's twisting, agonising tale of love and aloofness makes for good viewing.
","The Prestiege is about performers performing at the top of their game without necessarily being at the peak of their well-being. It's about an emotional drive; a lust to conquer the seemingly impossible, a lust to pound one's opponent into the ground by showing up their entertainments and furthering the superiority that yours has. There are points in the film in which sheer anger and pure, unadulterated drive born out of one's deep feelings see certain characters get to where they are in the entertainments business depicted within; successes born out the hatred for a competitor, and the need to trump him, rather than because their respective show naturally progresses to the performances they end up doing.Director Christopher Nolan's film explores the quite maddening extent to which men within a particular field go, not necessarily for financial gain but to see their competitors, with whom they share a painful back-story, go nuts in trying to work out the extent of the practise. His film is ultimately a peek into the depraved nature of such a pastime, an exploring of a lust for quest for supremacy in so much one person is able to do what no one else in the world is capable. Such a back and forth is played out in The Prestiege, it here having an air of freshness to it in so much it is played out not as a contemporary crime thriller or similarly toned piece making use of the familiar hypothesis, but as a period drama, in late nineteenth century London, and somewhat remarkably revolves around people engaged in the career field of magic.We begin in the present on a strand seeing Christian Bale's Alfred Borden in prison, a man seemingly guilty of a drowning which he is accused of perpetrating; during these early scenes, we get a small measure of how much the secrecy of these people's magic means to them when Borden holds back on certain nuggets of information - despite both his freedom and his daughter's well-being there at stake. Miles away, Borden's ex-partner, Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier, is desperate for a meeting with an elusive elderly gentlemen based in some isolated snowy American nether-regions; his presence rearing the attention of somebody operating there, whom he has before neither met nor seen, but who directs praise at Angier for his work within the field of magic and stage trickery. Running on what Nolan achieved in Memento, in terms of tearing up the time-lines and flitting from one moment in time to another, we dart back to the very beginning of where it all began to go wrong for Angier and Borden.In the past, the pair of them operated in a troupé led by the suave expert in his field, John Cutter (Caine); Angier's wife Julia (Perabo) and a master of ceremonies character in true-to-life magician Ricky Jay. Backstage, and prior to going out so as to perform what they've been performing for a good stretch of time beforehand, the characters appear to clash in regards to what direction the group ought to head from here on in; Borden desiring the moving onwards and upwards to better things but whose enthusiasm is unmatched. During one particular show, tragedy strikes when disaster befalls a specific trick involving Julia and a seemingly-impossible escape from a glass container full with water; Julia not getting out in time and drowning before Angier's very eyes, thus the murder of which Bale was accused during the opening thus rears its head. What unfolds is an extension of the diligent lengths Nolan went during 2002's Insomnia, a film about a police officer seen killing another police officer by the very man he is there to catch; a film spilling out into a power struggle between two men of whom moral lines are blurred and one appears as distasteful as the other in spite of the fact they are near-enough poles apart. This is another one of those films in which heterosexual romances unfold around the fact that the film is ultimately about men and men co-existing with one another, and that nothing can deter them from what life's true purpose seemingly offers up: the need to quench a drive for implementing defeat upon them.Nolan deals with each strand attentively and in a thorough manner; the film's story, cascading into a bitter rivalry built on resentment never quite made clear as to whether it's out of anger of a false-accusation; unadulterated revenge or just pure hatred and jealousy for another man, is difficult not to get caught up in. Amongst this, the multi-equilibrium approach expressed through Angier's apparent attempts to bury ghosts in his venturing to America acts as a fascinating post-scripture to predominant duelling. It is something that furthermore carries with it enough enticing drama, as this lead becomes more and more involved with apparent recluse madmen, to follow the film on through to a denouement dealing with questions posed throughout the project's main body. A quaint parallel lies with the fact Nolan knows he is making a film about people putting on a show; people wanting to do their best for a paying audience out to see those whom they recognise going through motions inherently and professionally. His film, itself full of tricks and twists causing us to take a step back and think about it, is just as good-a slice of showmanship as anything his characters can conjure up.",7,0,0,30 October 2011
The Terminator," More lacking beneath the surface of explosions and gunfire than I remember, but still very much worth a watch.
","The story goes that the inspiration behind the idea of the Terminator films derives from a bout of illness its creator, James Cameron, had whilst working on a previous project that had tumbled into being a bit of a creative nightmare. Frantically trying to piece what turned out to be 'Piranha: The Spawning' together in an edit lab against a ticking clock, Cameron became run down by something which gave him all sorts of unpleasant dreams about indestructible robots chasing him; his life being in mortal danger and nobody believing him.It is perhaps the nightmarish quality of 'The Terminator' which really allows it to stand out. Let us not mince our words, here – Cameron essentially hopped from one exploitation feature to another in making it. Everything that needs to be present for an effective Z-movie is present: the gore; the action; the nudity; the causality and the lack of a plot. That is not to be rude to the IDEA, which is wonderful - a robot killing machine is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of a brave resistance leader, who is proving to be a thorn in the side of the metal maniacs in their attempts to wipe out every last human-being. One of Cameron's characters even pokes fun at the premise, describing what the robot is attempting to do as a kind of 'retroactive abortion'. It is, however, little more than a cue for all-out mayhem across the urban sprawl of Los Angeles.We have all read the essays and digested the feminist theory which revolves around the character of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) enough times by now for anybody to need to rehash it here. Put simply, Connor is the aforementioned target – the protagonist who learns of her destiny and is taken from being your generic bimbo, and a useless waitress, to a brave soldier. Later theory would revolve around Connor and the Terminator character transgressing their respective roles in the sequel, which had the 'killer' robot being reprogrammed to become a mother/guardian figure and Hamilton's character tooling up to wipe out a defenceless anomaly (Miles Bennett Dyson) for being something they were not even privy to.Chasing Connor here is Arnold Schwarzenegger's titular Terminator: a metal exoskeleton operating underneath living flesh tissue and impervious to the pathetic weaponry of the 1980's, while also sent back is one of the future humans' top fieldsmen in Kyle Reece (Michael Biehn). One of the most endearing things about watching the film now, I suppose, is that each are playing the roles they are most famous for. The opening exchanges, as both time-travellers adapt to their surroundings; tools up to take the other on and go about hunting down Sarah, are good value. We witness The Terminator dealing with three rough-shot punks upon arrival with the simplest of ease, while Reece is depicted as actually having to run away and hide when the police pick up on his otherworldly arrival. Cameron's goal is fairly obvious: the odds are stacked against the good guys.What follows is by no means 'bad', but it is remarkable as to how quickly the film settles into a causality driven process of action; chase and recovery – something is to be said, however, in the way Cameron kicks things back into life via the ingenious ways the Terminator picks back up on his prey again when it seems they've gotten away. More substantial is Cameron's social commentary, not to mention the love story which develops between Reece and Connor. Cameron shoots on location in Los Angeles at night, capturing the down-to-Earth reality of homelessness; street hoodlums and the general junk and filth which litters the streets – making, in the process, a correlation between the nightmarish ruined LA of the future, where the war is taking place. The film goes on to use a very clever transitional edit using a caterpillar track during scene whereby Reece falls asleep and dreams of the future to reiterate this: utopias do not exist.Digging a little deeper, and analysing some of the franchise's cod-philosophies to do with destiny; making the future what it is and not being bound to your fate, may very well reveal one or two more truths, but that is for the individual viewer. On the whole, and while I am unsure as to whether there is as much substance here as everybody seems to remember, 'The Terminator' does very little of what it attempts to do especially badly, and I think that is what propels its lasting power.",7,1,4,13 April 2017
Cloverfield," Exhilarating and relentless experience that echoes the first-hand, hand-held footage of 9/11 and transforms it into a thing of pure terror and threat without exploitation.
","There is a scene in Roland Emmerich's 1998 film Godzilla in which a character is holding a video camera as the aforementioned monster walks towards him, eventually standing on him, but seeing the character survive. The notion of an individual with a video camera as a large monster gallivants towards them will almost certainly never be seen in the same way again following Cloverfield. Films like Cloverfield are the reason films like Godzilla age; they take the idea to another level and render a prior project, that wasn't done sufficiently well in the first place, close to complete garbage. If, in the past, we were supposed to chuckle at said scene in Godzilla with our tongues firmly within our cheeks, then viewing it again after Cloverfield will produce full-blown laughs; specifically AT the text rather than with it.Some of my favourite films from last year carried a very brooding sense of both overall menace and danger, specifically: There Will Be Blood; Lust, Caution; No Country for Old Men and 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days to mention but a few. Cloverfield is additionally one of my favourites from last year, in the sense it carries a brooding sense of danger and menace but maintains a certain style; a certain craft and a certain aesthetic that makes the experience exciting, memorable and equally engaging but through different techniques. Shame on anyone that dismisses this as a shaky-cam, substance-less and seemingly mindless piece of entertainment that cannot rank along said films when in actual fact, it carries the necessary conventions to make it a worthwhile piece.Cloverfield sees a group of contemporary Americans, armed with one of the most durable diegetic cameras in cinematic history, flee their apartment building on the night of a party as a huge explosion and subsequent events both horrific and mysterious transpire. They make their way through the ever-increasingly swamped city of New York, as populated by innocent by-standers trying to fathom what's going on, in the meek hope of finding Beth (Yustman), one of the character's partners. In every sense of the word, the film is punishing, but in a positive sense. The camera in Cloverfield takes more punishment than either of the two featured in The Blair Witch Project; the characters take a battering, the city of New York takes a battering through some impressive special effects and basic-as-you-like generic horror conventions take a battering. Take for example, the scene in the underground railway system in which the lights are off and something's in there with you: a set up so ordinary and so basic is actually made to feel fresh and quite frightening.The film begins in an ominous fashion, with a subtitle telling us the following footage was found in an area 'formerly known as Central Park', planting seeds in our minds that suggest destruction and devastation - something seems to have happened that renders Central Park of the past tense. This additionally introduces the audience into a sense of viewership, thus placing us in the bodies of a highly ranked government official or someone else of vast importance as we sit down and prepare for footage of top secrecy. The film then goes down the very effective route of unfolding all this entirely from a first person perspective, that of a character named Hud (Miller) who is holding the camera, which really immerses us in this unfolding, ensuing action-come-survival film.The point of attack, in the nicest possible way, sees a surprise party held for Rob (Stahl-David) as he heads off to Japan (a reference to the nation that gave us Godzilla) to start a new job. The opening features all the typical, hand-held shots as shot by someone at a party and sets up the shooting style for the rest of the film. During the set up, we get various paper-thin introductions to various people that do not necessarily require immense introduction, but need enough on them for us to be able to invest time with them. This, however basic or mundane, Cloverfield achieves during this segment. The characters that we do follow, along with Hud the camera man, consist of: Jason (Vogel); Marlena (Caplan) and Lilly (Lucas).The film deliberately lacks that narrative drive, with escape from New York and general survival the aim of the game. Primarily, the film sees its characters try as hard as they can to rescue Beth from her apartment in a part of town that has been hit by the destruction hardest. What unfolds is a street level drama that sometimes delves below ground or into the nether-regions of an apartment block in order to get a cross further thrills and chills and it actually works really well. A word on when they actually go below deck; in a scene that sees them begin in a subway station – a further stomping of 1998's Godzilla into a hole that it now thoroughly deserves to be buried in, when, you'll remember, the climax to that film saw equivalently-sized beasties stalk the lead characters through a subway station. Oh, how that is looking old now.",8,0,0,4 June 2009
Sleepy Hollow," Not very good
","The film got good reviews and I cant believe I watched it. The castlooked good but they were all given pathetic cameo's. (Except for,of course Johnny Depp) It started out all right with the mysteryfactor playing a big role. Who did it? Why? When? What's going tohappen next? etc. But suddenly It was revealed and a silly 'Se7en'like film kicks in with the horse man killing people not randomlybut specific people at specific times. Hence, Depp's job becominga lot more easier and the film getting way out of breath.",5,1,2,29 November 2002
Hotel Rwanda," Solid and quite frightening at times recounting of a desperate situation in 1994 Rwanda.
","One of the more common reactions to have in regards to a tragic, real life event played out on screen is one of great sadness – it's just a reactionary thing that something so horrible is even capable of happening to people who just don't deserve it. Hotel Rwanda is a film that is able to produce these sorts of reactions, but also feelings on a level of suspense and horror as certain scenes and situations play out involving people we have come to be quite fond of. The film is more of a re-telling of certain events than it is a study of anything in particular, although the protagonist of the hour does possess characteristics of great honour and courage at a time of need. In truth, Hotel Rwanda does feel a little bit stagey at times while at others, feels made for television. You do, also, feel as if you're being chastised as a Westerner – that something as horrific as this happened and you let it happen; but the film mostly offers positive vibes.The hotel in Rwanda of which the title refers to is one owned by a certain Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), a harmless but rich and quite successful Rwandan living with his harmless and equally rich family. He has a wife named Tatiana (Okonedo) and a few children. He runs a hotel and takes care of his employees as well as his family in good measure. Importing goods and taking care of those that need taking care of are the run of the norm and these things are the most he has to concern himself with. But that is about to change. The film breaks away from this supposedly 'idyillac' set up for a turf-war of sorts between rival tribes, named the Hutu and Tutsi, that goes back many years; although by the mid point, you feel the tribesmen are unconcerned with whatever legacy they're fighting for and just enjoy chopping up some other people, such is the manner in which the history and details of the rivalry is developed.No matter, we're not here for a history lesson from yonder-century; we're here for a history lesson from yonder-decade, 1994 in fact. One thing leads to another and Rusesabagina's hotel quickly becomes Schindler's factory when push, not so much turns to shove, as it does cold-blooded execution by way of machete. Most of the locals not interested in the bloodshed want in, and it's Paul's duty to save as many as possible as the 'guest' list totes up. But can he save all these people and take care of his family? What about supplies? What happens if/when the U.N. pull out? All this occurs as the rest of the world look on, and Canadian U.N. higher-up Colonel Oliver (Nolte) pauses for thought now and again as well as pulling his gun from his holster and waving it around at times of supposed urgency.Paul himself is a Tutsi and the early warning signs occur when he, in the passenger seat of a harmless van transporting him to his home, has a run in with a Hutu before the bulk of the bloodshed has begun. The warning and the hatred is planted in a fairly well done manner and it's all fine because later on, things will get really hairy. Like I said, the film is a re-telling of events more than it is a true study of anything. Paul is established to be this above-ordinary Rwandan living a life that 95% of Rwandans don't have the luxury of living; he has a wife and child and there's a lot of grief before the nice, clean hero is put through a grinder and we're all supposed to go 'Oh No! I hope no harm comes to him!' It's fine, but it's unspectacular and it doesn't really matter if the backdrop is the 1994 Rwandan Genocide; the Holocaust or some made up event a hundred years in the future when aliens come to Earth and enslave us.What the film does do, in some retrospect, is demonstrate what people are willing to do in times of great distress. If Paul is willing to allow people into his hotel for safety and stay behind with the others deemed doomed when certain people have to pull out, then that is that but on the flip side there's a lot of greed in the film; a sense that 'sure, we'll help you out' but always for a price – a sort of 'what's in it for us?' mentality that the film sort of captures. But Hotel Rwanda is a very respectful and, on the broader sense of things, important film that will remind many people in the West of the situation that happened; a Western world that, as the film so very clearly points out, contributed hardly anything to, bar pull their own people out thus saving their own skins. If the film's overall goal was to recount the event that happened at that time then it succeeds and that is worthy enough of certain praise.",7,1,2,13 April 2009
Catch-22," Smart and breakaway anti-war film that bravely incorporates elements of a comedic nature on top of an already disorientating experience.
","Let's just say Catch-22 is a lot less straight forward than director Mike Nicholls' previous film, The Graduate. In fact, whilst studying the rather simple premise of an individual sick of the war he's fighting in and desperately wanting to get home, Catch-22 moves off down a road that blurs the boundaries between reality and non-reality; incorporating dreams, fantasies, visions and other such things that I'm sure are mere hallucinations invoked by hapless soldiers wanting to escape from where they currently are. Yes, it's deluded and yes, it's muddled but it echoes its characters' predicament and the general mindset they seem to force themselves to resort to at times of great stress.I'm assuming it's common knowledge but films to be Taxi Driver and Apocalypse Now may well have taken a mite of inspiration from Catch-22, two films that looked at the effects of war (one back home/one actually on the front line) and distilled those effects as well as the world around them that they gaze at through the lead character's sub- conscious. Catch-22 does this to a degree but what distinguishes it is its approach to this idea and how comedy as well as out and out farce can be incorporated into such a foundation.Catch-22 works for the best part of its runtime, combining a feast of familiar names and actors with the idea that war is Hell and its lead just wanting to get out but additionally, the ideas of a comedic and avant-garde nature as we see things unravel from an already distorted perspective. It's worth mentioning here that the lead is a United States Air Force bombardier named Yossarian, played by Alan Arkin, and it's also worth mentioning he is stabbed very early on in the film and consequently, his already desperate perspective and desperate wish to just go home is further hampered by a teetering on death's door.So point of view is an important ingredient to the film, explored on a large scale through its lead but there are glimpses or ideas of being toyed with on a smaller scale when a burning bomber crash lands on a runway as higher-ups, whom have already been established as perhaps having their heads in the clouds anyway, in the foreground walk on by casually. This is maybe some sort of statement on the propaganda behind warfare and how you enable yourself to 'see' only what you want to 'see' and that the gritty, realistic lead character 'sees' just about everything but those with blinders on that don't allow their best soldiers to leave fail to 'see' the bigger picture of what's going on.The Catch 22 of the title is an inescapable clause, buried within the United States Air Force foundations. It goes something along the lines of only being able to quit and go home if it's deemed the war has made you go crazy but you cannot officially be deemed crazy if you file to be labelled crazy in the first place. It reminded me of the line in 2005 film 'Proof' during which Anthony Hopkins stated 'crazy people don't sit around all day debating whether they're still sane  they've got better things to do.' Yossarian has to balance this simple yet infuriating equation of a catch-22 nature as he copes with his being stabbed and sorting his way through a series of flashbacks-come-memories of previous bombing missions that feel real to him.One of the reasons I think Catch-22 gets across its bizarre atmosphere is due to the number of times during which Yossairan hears someone tell him to 'help the bombardier'. 'But I'm the bombardier' he replies  'then help him!' says the voice. Such a contradictory and confusing exchange of words only echoes the regulations of catch-22 itself, an odd and contradictory set of words that do not amount to anything bar keeping you in your current situation. This echoes the exchange between the voice and Yossarian: I feel Yossarian hears these words whilst he lies on the slab, in a state of semi- consciousness as the medics talk around him. The exchange does not help Yossarian's situation but they do keep him in the fixed situation he's in: half dead and on an operating table.There are flashes of white in the film. The idea that you 'step into the light' and enter the afterlife. This is a mere representation of Yossarian's near-death experience as he recovers from the ordeal but they act as a series of distracting transitions that add to the confusing nature of the film and Nicholls quite impressively toys with the use of colour and visual tricks to further distract us from the bigger picture and study of what's going on. There are other comic touches, simplistic but very effective, like one such soldier carrying the rank and name of 'Major' and additionally, the absurdity of having Vietnamese flags fluttering on the front of a military jeep. Orson Welles makes an appearance that gives the film yet another surreal kick. Catch-22 delivers on the grounds of a tale of one man wanting to escape his current situation and get back to some sort of normality; it's a funny, twisting and quite creepy film that healthily delivers on all those fronts.",7,0,2,6 February 2009
Ocean's Twelve," Ultimately Flawed
","I wasn't totally sure of how I would react to this film in terms of 'opinion on quality' as I hadn't seen the first film. Whether or not that would prove to be my downfall or not was just one of those things at the back of my mind telling me I might not enjoy this as much as I think I would've had it been the first film. As it turned out, I didn't enjoy as much as I estimated I would've.The film has quite a large cast and many of the actors/actresses are back from the first film I discovered so in terms of presenting the characters and all round acting in general, I thought that it wouldn't have been very different to that of the first film. As it was, the acting was good with a fine nervous performance from Damon's character and Clooney and Pitt also do their best.The humour is also just about up to standard. It's thrown in there amongst the pretty dismal plot where they try to make something relatively simple, uncontrollably difficult which not only falls on it's face but leaves bruise marks for all to see when it try's to get back up again. That saying, the jokes do roll along rather nicely and just manage to crop up at the right times giving the film a nice 'timed' feel to it. The Julia Robert's 'sketch' was quite a breath of fresh air in amongst all the confusion. It slowed everything right down and gave me not only a chance to catch my breath but to enjoy a rather surreal scene involving both real, fake and fake-real actors/actresses. Good stuff.Of course with all the good acting, funny jokes and such aside; film's rely on plots and this one, as mentioned above, didn't really impress me. As I say, it try's to make something difficult when it was quite simple to start off with. It starts off all well and good with the 're-aquiring' of the gang but generally starts to fall away as it looses ground on people. They've obviously gone for the bold option here and credit to them for trying but it just didn't float my boat.If decimals were a part of IMDb's voting system, then it would've been slightly higher than a six out of ten but in this case, the film deserves to be rounded down.",6,0,1,13 February 2005
Crash," Haggis produces something that makes us aware; that tells us to open our eyes. Intriguing and often quite powerful.
","Until very recently, this film held a high spot on my own personal top 50 films; that is until I re-watched it and it fell a few dozen places. But let that not fool you, for Crash is still a well made and in depth look at life, race, racism in society and that element of fate that binds us all; wherever we live. When you deal with films that tackle race and racism, it's always good to make your first port of call information on the writer. From what we know, Paul Haggis is a white Canadian and yet he includes characters in his film who are of the Asian, African-American and Hispanic decent. I would not say he does all of them justice but one theme that lies within Crash is, in fact, stereotyping and how we perceive someone of another race on first glance.I think when I saw this at the cinema two years ago; I came out thinking I'd seen something that was brilliant. Two years of maturity towards other races and having met many more people, some of which are not of my own white, Caucasian; the film does not seem as spell-binding and amazing as I first thought although the scene in which one character's little girl 'saves' him form a bullet still pulled at the emotional strings; a little harder this time around for some reason  maybe because I watched it alone this time, who knows. But anyway, Crash remains a smart and somewhat deep film. The idea at its core is 'how do we see people around us of different descent?' A very early scene has Anthony (Ludacris) comment, out loud, on his distaste for Jean Cabot (Bullock) as she displays defensive body language upon seeing two black people walking down the road together. It is all about first impressions and how we perceive other people. The twist or the sting in the tail is, of course, that what follows is a carjacking of said persons.But Haggis does not make the error of making a point and then counteracting it. Later on, a Persian (not Arab, they want you to know) shopkeeper gets extremely hostile toward Daniel (Peña), a Mexican locksmith, but only does so through his own lack of ability to speak the language native to the country he is a citizen of (English in America). Similarly; when Jean and her husband Rick (Fraser) get home from the carjacking, Jean has similar antagonistic feelings toward Daniel because she has just suffered at the hand of rejecting her instincts for another ethnic group: she isn't going to make the same mistake and goes with her hunch by insulting Daniel who she believes will pass on their keys to his burglar 'amigos' after changing the locks. We find out a scene later than Daniel is a loving and caring father with a wife and kid; one of whom it would seem has suspended his own dreams in order to move out of a rough neighbourhood after a stray bullet crashed through his daughter's bedroom. This perception Jean has is wrong; she was correct in thinking Anthony and his buddy were hostile but grossly incorrect in Daniel - this is the theme; perception.Crash is set over the Christmas period; a time of year difficult for most people given the reunion with families (some of which people will not like) and everything is very busy and highly strung. This creates the perfect backdrop for Crash and its issues. Likewise, staying with the initial perception theme; police officer John Ryan (Dillon) is a racist and a bigot when he is faced with extreme situations or times of testosterone rush: the phone conversation with Shaniqua and the frisking of the other black woman are examples of this; I mention this because our usual perception of white cops may be that they are law abiding and upstanding  something Ryan's partner Tom Hansen (Phillippe) certainly embodies although the denouement in his life occurs when the obnoxious, hitchhiking African American he is giving a lift to later on acts suspiciously when he reaches into his pocket; what follows is nothing short of typical, for a number of reasons that would spoil the film if I went into them.I think an important scene in the film that embodies the films themes is the one in the TV studio; the director comes down from the gallery and states that a character didn't say the line 'black' enough. Such a situation highlights, once again, the difficultness we have of coming to terms with stereotypes and what's what. If the African American did not say the line like he did then maybe that's not how he speaks after all; likewise, who wrote the script within the script? A white man? A black man? We'll never know, and we'll never know if he imagined black people to talk like that. Needless to say, the director that comes down is white and he says it to a black floor director. Crash itself may have be written by a white Canadian but it does show at points; the Korean characters of Mr and Mrs. Ho aren't well written and there are some needless arguments spawned by race; a black character and someone Hispanic argue over what should have been said over a phone call and it seems all a bit silly but there you go. In the end, no one has really 'won'. Detective Waters has found his brother; John Ryan's father is still very sick; the Cambodians that are found are let loose into the streets of hate and racism without any aid at all and people still shunt one another in their cars. It may not be a pretty film but it's often powerful, often interesting and makes you think about those of different race around you.",8,1,7,29 February 2008
Snatch," Ritchie out does his previous effort and provides us with plenty more escapist gangster shenanigans with Snatch.
","I can remember seeing Snatch. for the first time and being a little confused; it didn't help that I saw it on commercial television and frequently had the then what seemed to be complicated narrative broken up by advertisement breaks. Since then I've seen it several times, uninterrupted, and it's just the sort of film that grows on you. The film is funny, it moves at an enjoyable pace but includes its fair share of long takes cranking up the bizarre atmosphere it has and most of the scenes are accompanied with some brilliant dialogue. This is classed as a British gangster film, despite its post-modern touches, but I feel it can hold it's own up there with the greats of the genre in that respective cannon.The funny thing with Ritchie's gangster films is that they rely on that message of entertainment. Ritchie's films are not about deranged and disgruntled post Second World War youths alá Brighton Rock and nor are they about fish-out-of-water individuals travelling to far off places to do battle against pornography and murder alá Get Carter  neither do they attempt to tackle issues to do with Britain as a whole such as the rise in prostitution (Mona Lisa) and globalisation twinned with the threat of the IRA (The Long Good Friday). No, Ritchie's gangster films carry an air of escapism rather than realism and very much keep the gangster in the world of their own, very much fixed on problems of their own.In its essence, Snatch. is similar to Ritchie's prior film Lock, Stock in the sense its about a collection of individuals whom are in debt to a more powerful, more ruthless criminal. That criminal here is Brick Top (Ford) and he is much more menacing than Hatchet Harry. The persons in debt are Tommy (Graham) and Turkish (Statham), a twosome instead of a foursome as seen in Lock, Stock. Then there are the little connections you spot such as Boris (Serbedzija) being able to 'get anything you like' similarly to Nick the Greek in Lock, Stock and the visual approach of the fancy transitions and thoroughly amusing voiceovers.Snatch. plays out like a noir infused electric shock; opening up with a voice-over in a gloomy room by the lead character and then hopping around sending us on a long and complicated journey which adopts a multi-strand approach. But this is not a pulpy detective story, even though it has several characters chasing a specific object, and it is not a study of seduction and betrayal. Snatch. covers a diamond heist and the resulting jewel getting mixed up in the crazy world Ritchie creates but more-so focuses on the two individuals of Turkish and Tommy in their ongoing struggle with Brick Top.If the British gangster genre relies on gritty realism and hard as nails characters wading through a seedy and down right nasty location in search of the truth then Snatch. perhaps ignores this and adopts the aesthetic of escapism. Erratic subtitles shoot across the screen to the sound effects of mock pistols firing; split screen telephone conversations that pop up and retreat again when someone speaks and wired crash zooms on the text written on the side of guns accompanied with bizarre sound effects make up this gangster film. Snatch. is not set in Newcastle circa 1971 what with its seacoal dispatchers and its chimneys and factories; nor is it post Second World War Brighton with its grimy looking streets covered in terrace housing and racecourses that turn into switchblade death-traps as a superpower struggles to re-build after the war. Snatch. is proud of where it's set and a lot of the grimy locations are accompanied with music that sounds sarcastic, the scene in which Tommy and George approach the Pikey campsite being one. Along with this, it has the audacity to make it all seem very funny.Two such examples where Ritchie suspends all reality in this film occur when an American diamond dealer is on the phone to the man that stole it, who is at a tailors - he is seen in several different outfits in very quick succession which is obviously impossible. The second example of which manipulates time in an equally carefree manner happens when Turkish explains hare coursing to Tommy  their conversation takes place over a series of cuts spanning three locations that I can only assume would've taken a fair amount of time to cover; it begs the question what they spoke about during the in-between cuts. The conversation starts at the campsite, covers the car journey and ends in a muddy field somewhere as Turkish explains something in very little time.But Snatch. will remain one of my favourite films; a sort of escapist gangster film that ties in elements of the gangster-heavy thanks to Brick Top's character but keeps the mood relatively light with characters you're not supposed to understand and others whose hapless journey through the underworld will see them in body bags; holding up a bounty hunter in a pub letting off extra loud blanks in moving vehicles. It's fast, it's abruptly named, it's quotable and it's one of my favourite films ever made.",10,0,1,5 September 2008
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's stab at comedy hits the mark most times with superior story telling for the time but the aging is the biggest problem here.
","Although it's Kubrick (and I like Kubrick a great deal), 'Dr. Strangelove' left me a little under-whelmed and a little disappointed. I would go so far as to say that the film's main problem is in it's aging as its content and the way in which the film is delivered are fine; in fact, they actually feel ahead of their time.The film's core subject is the Cold War  this is obvious. The Cold War ran between the end of the second world war (1945) and ended in the early 1990s with the fall of the Soviet Union so between these dates I'm sure this film was at the top of every AFI and BFI list imaginable not to mention people's personal ones as well. I can imagine people watching this film during the Cold War and genuinely being entertained that something so serious can be looked at in such a carefree and laughable way and this is very clever  something only Kubrick and probably no one else could actually pull off. The way in which the Russians are allowed into America's secret den, the way suspicion and humour are connected during the 'he's secretly taking pictures!' gag and throughout as well as the way in which former Nazi accomplices are represented.The film also uses the technique of revolving around three different stories which is very advanced and adds to the film. These is the base and its fate in which American planes are purposely ordered to attack the USSR; the 'allies' in an underground American bunker dealing with the situation (and getting into some hilarious phone calls with the Russians whilst they're at it); and the lone plane that breaks away from Allied control as it nears its Soviet target.The first setting and its main characters: Group Captain Mandrake (Sellers) and the aptly named bringer of death General Jack Ripper (Hayden) are absolutely hilarious to watch. Mandrake is English and remains calm in a crisis; only maybe raising his voice when he needs to give a monologue stating how he's taking control  this is counteracted by Ripper's disturbing persona and ideas about how he's going to make the world a better place by, technically, destroying it. He has his own brilliant monologue all about water and an interesting conspiracy surrounding it.The second setting's humour comes across in the figure of phone calls to a Soviet leader whom we never hear speak yet totally understand through the American's conversation route. When he's told planes are heading to nuke a part of his country: 'Yes, I can understand you're upset(!)' is the American's next line of dialogue. We also spend enough time with the bomber crew to have feelings towards them even if it is the worst 'story' of the three as all that happens in terms of dialogue are co-ordinates and the like which makes it feel like a shoddy documentary on an air force crew. There aren't many funny moments either although the ending does enforce some laughs and the bomber crew are involved.Like I said, the film hasn't aged well in terms of its content about the Cold War; Russia used to be the enemy  now we have a new one. This may be my own unique interpretation but I feel events in Iraq have now come to dominate the 'war' content/topic/theme in most of our lives. As well as this, the jokes do not come as free flowing as I expected and the film does threaten to take itself a little too seriously at times  probably down to the seriousness behind the bomber crew's storyline.Even though the brainwave of the Nazi in the chair and his ideas of creating a new, ideal group of people underground if nuclear war does happen; all the while resisting his Nazi roots and saluting with one arm is a stroke of genius, it's the ideas and script concepts that carry the film  not the humour within. This is probably Kubrick's least 'epic' film and as a result is probably (from what I've seen) my least favourite but that said, it's still an impressive attempt and shouldn't discourage you from seeing it.",7,0,5,11 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," An engaging, often resounding, finale which hits more notes than it misses.
","The original Star Wars franchise here goes out with a bang and not a whimper, in the 'sixth' episode of the popular franchise, as it certainly deserves to. Conspicuously, the 'Star Wars' brand name and its original trilogy had eluded me until a fairly recent point in my life, when a combination of chance and sheer bloody mindedness saw me finally sit down and see them. While it would be dishonest to remark that I share in the unabashed, unchecked and often maddening enthusiasm for the films that others certainly have, I cannot say I disliked them and the way 'Return of the Jedi' rounded off loose ends; did well to keep fresh characters who might otherwise have become tiresome and told its own narrative, was satisfying.Principally, this Episode Six is a combination of what worked best in Episodes Four and Five: the old tale of a rebel alliance looking to destroy an intergalactic structure known as the Death Star is back, while a secondary narrative to do with the franchise's protagonist Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) simultaneously confronting Darth Vader and learning to conquer a mythic pseudo-philosophy known as 'The Force' props proceedings up. Action-packed and romantic do battle, in a sense, with contemplative and familial melodrama.What is, perhaps, most peculiar about the film is that it does not blast off into being a full-on action-adventurer until exactly the 50 minute point. Also quite striking is the fact that, from the moment C3PO utters his first lines, there is not a single instance of two characters that are not either robots or alien creatures communicating to one another for about forty minutes. On my first crack at the film, I did not even notice this but realised it suddenly on my second go - credit must go to those responsible for being involved in such fantastic makeup and costuming.The film's opening captions finally inform us that the war which has dogged the franchise is over 'freedom', something the alliance fights for and something the Empire, seemingly, wish to do away with. A new Death Star is being constructed; the opening shots reveal it to look about 80% finished, so there is a sense of urgency to events from the off. Darth Vader lands on it, looking for answers on why it isn't finished - he speaks of the yet unseen Emperor, who runs the entire outfit, and reminds us that he's much nastier, which cleverly builds the off-screen character up through dialogue.The film's opening act is essentially a continuation of where we left off prior: Harrison Ford's Han Solo is still frozen-solid in a block of something-or-other, and is captive to a large slug-like alien known as a Hutt named Jabba, having been taken to him in-between episodes. Our heroes, led by Luke, set out to rescue him from Jabba's decrepit desert-set palace-prison with a scheme which seemingly involved Leia (Carrie Fisher) being caught as well; Luke doing battle with a giant monster in an inescapable pit and then later standing on a plank looking at oblivion in the form of a creature consisting of tentacles and a mouth buried in the sand. Was this all part of the plan? How did he know the entire crew would even be taken out into the desert at all?Eventually, differences are settled, one way or another, and the film moves on into territory perhaps more synonymous with the franchise when, as in Episode 4, the force behind the push to defeat the Empire congregates in a control room and deliberates a plan of attack. The Star itself is orbiting a moon known as Endor, which consists largely of dense woodland - the attack will break off into two parts: a fleet of ships will hit the Star directly while a platoon of soldiers, led by Solo, will infiltrate the moon in order to find and disable a power station allowing the Star to shield itself.This is all standard stuff, perhaps made a little less interesting than Episode Five by the fact Solo and Leia know how they feel for one another. More interesting is the character of Skywalker, who has an emotional heart-to-heart with mentor Yoda (Frank Oz) in which, subversively, the protagonist realises he must fight the antagonist, although does not want to. Luke is now a trained Jedi, so is no match for anybody in the combat stakes - in a lesser film, he would be the invincible lead too easily hacking his way to the endgame, but is here made vulnerable to falling, potentially, to the 'dark' side of the force thus undoing all his training. This being prone to something is vital for a sense of there being something at stake; for there being a sense the hero might fail. Scenes involving Luke; Vader and the Emperor on this strand are the best in the film. When the final duel arrives, it is as much a war of words fought in the minds and souls of the characters as it is between lightsabers.The other strand involves the rest of the gang gunning their way towards the power station, although are seemingly no match for a tiny race of neutral furry creatures known as Ewoks who capture them, but then befriend them. There is a peculiar moment whereby C3PO and R2D2 retell the entire Star Wars narrative to this point to these tiny animals, sort of a cross between a bushbaby and a Yorkshire terrier, in order to warrant their support and they listen on in absolute fascination - is the point here that WE are the primitive Ewoks, who have thus far fallen for all of it too? Whatever anything is supposed to point towards, 'Return of the Jedi' is a ripping yarn which, say it quietly, even graduates into being halfway intelligently made on more than one occasion.",7,0,0,6 April 2019
Pan's Labyrinth," If you're going to see a high budget foreign language film, see this.
","The reason Pan's Labyrinth works is because it's a clever film that tackles numerous different subjects on various different levels giving the viewer lots to focus on and get involved with. The film studies good and evil, loneliness, love or lack of love towards human beings as well as made-up creatures such as fairies. It's also able to draw the viewer into its world of intrigue and fantasy; tempting us and forcing us to think for ourselves whether or not what's happening is real as although this is a realist film, there is enough material to suggest otherwise.Setting is so important in the film, so much so as the film begins in a car en-route; there is no such time for introductions and pleasantries. The majority of the film is set at an army base in the Spanish woodland but locations within locations are so much more important: the barn, the woodshed, the bedroom and the woods themselves all serve as dangerous and bleak locations  this twinned with excellent cinematography gives off a sort of 'trapped' feeling that anywhere you go, you're in trouble. Of course, Ofelia's (Baquero) visions or dreams or whatever you want to call them up until the closing fifteen minutes act as an escape from these bleak surroundings but what an escape. In order to get away from her living, Ofelia must put herself in situations and places that are far more dangerous than the camp, she must face foes that are far more dangerous than an uncaring father in law or Spanish soldiers in the hills who are outgunned anyway and each sequence makes for fascinating viewing.There is enough talk and build up through dialogue early on to suggest all is not right in the house at the camp. Very early on in the film, it is slightly impossible to say whether or not Ofelia is dreaming or really is living out a fantasy: a flying bug, wind whistling through the house 'talking' to the occupants and the faces on inanimate objects (even the fireplace) create an eerie build up to what awaits but all these things are possible in the real world: wind through houses making them 'creak', flying bugs and the patterns that make up faces around the place  can you honestly say you've never looked at a pansy flower and thought it might be smiling back at you? However, Pan's Labyrinth is such a clever film that it turns us around not instantly but slowly. It smells our interest and curiosity and toys with it like it's a waft of a freshly cooked pie resting on a window ledge. Ofelia is given a book that will 'show her' things but it's completely blank until it wants to work; the bug turns into a fairy but Ofelia's been reading books about fairies just before bed and the old faun may be an impossible thing to encounter in the real world but is it just a delusion of an animal she saw or is it her imagination mixed with the new, country air she can smell and has never smelt before? After all, she did say it smelt of 'earth'  maybe as an urban child, she has never really smelt 'earth' before and created an image of what 'earth' might look.Pan's Labyrinth is not just a film about a confused girl but also a double act of brilliant storytelling when thinking of the soldiers stories. The two sides are at loggerheads throughout, leading to bloody and compelling shootouts throughout; there is even space for betrayal and forbidden love between sides, something that is woven in superbly. I watched as the Fascist soldiers set themselves tasks; small tasks and objectives to defeat the enemy or secure their own safety. Maybe Ofelia is watching and setting her self these tasks  since her father in law is in control, maybe she's copying him and trying to win her own war that she has created in her mind; either way, the way both sides of the film are sewed together is just a joy to watch.I am yet to mention the emotional depth the film carries when dealing with friendships, a mother before birth, betrayal, a child just trying to help, isolation and a smashed watch as it would just spoil it. If I do have a gripe it's because I don't like it when a character blatantly does something wrong just to spurn an action scene and here, it involves some grapes but this should in no way put you off as Pan's Labyrinth is a class act in storytelling, unpredictability and cinematography; amongst so many other things.",8,2,5,23 September 2007
Blade II," The film relies on visuals to cover up its frustratingly poor plotting.
","Despite enjoying the first outing of Blade; I was very weary going into the sequel of a film that relied on blood, over the top action and comic book violence to tell its story and I'm glad I was otherwise I would've disliked this second film even more.What happens in Blade II is that Blade is forced to ally with his mortal enemies, the vampires, to fight an even deadlier foe that will consume both of them. First the vampires; then the humans. The main problem with Blade II is that it's completely full of holes. The way the film is pieced together means it keeps that oddly distracting air of mystery and sense of no real trust between the two allied forces that spoils, and thus ruins, the end twist. The whole truce plot is very weak throughout and you definitely get that feeling, especially since the initial incident of them attempting to make a truce features a female vampire trying to decapitate our hero instead of reasoning with him. What's more, the truce is actually hard to fathom given their filmic situation and the hatred they have for one another in their world.Another thing that was weak was the fact I could see straight through the third ally character. I found it amazingly convenient that Blade had found a new sidekick following Whislter being taken by the vampires; and the twist towards the end can be seen a mile off. Rather than add something to the team; the character of Scud was really just someone there to make it look like 'the whole Vampire race/ three others' rather than 'the whole Vampire race and just two others'. The only thing he added to the film was the fact a daft, predictable twist was sure to arise. Something that I found laughable when really I shouldn't have was the fact that once the Vampires and Blade's threesome are together; they create more problems for themselves rather than their enemies. Scud gets himself into all sorts of problems when he's operating his surveillance van and the other allies just don't seem to learn that bullets won't work on these bad guys (Not yet, anyway). Another annoying, predictable thing the film has going for it is the vampire team Blade's assigned with. I thought these particular characters would make for juicy cannon fodder once the film progressed; and I wasn't too far wrong  brainless and only mildly entertaining. By the time the film has entered its final third and all the twists start to unravel, its become a bit of a mess. Suddenly, bullets can kill the Reaper Vampires, the normal vampires aren't so 'good' anymore and Scud can't even seem to remember weather his own inventions are or aren't explosive devices. With this, Blade II relies on visuals to make up for it's holey plot. The fight scenes are impressive at times whenever weapons are involved but the final fight was a little too 'you hit me, I hit you' in my opinion. I liked the early references to Samurai with the Japanese sliding doors mise-en-scene and reference to swords and the script has some amusing quips and situations the Vampires and Blade's unit find themselves facing and sharing throughout. But, with too many things wrong with it overall; I have to stand up and say that this is rather overrated and a little care with how obvious/inconspicuous certain plot points should be made should've been addressed better.",5,0,2,19 February 2007
Alien," Superior horror film which executes the basics more than just efficiently.
","They must have thought that that was very clever of them when they first conceived it: depict a female character undress to her briefs, whilst alone in an enclosed space capsule. Then, have her walk around for a bit, distract the audience by leaning over slightly, and then 'wham!' - have the monster of the piece wriggle around a bit in the background within the confines of a crawlspace it has found for itself... Much water has passed beneath the proverbial bridge by this point in the film, however, but it does demonstrate quite perfectly how rudimentary 'jump' scenes such as the one just described can be as effective as this one is if everything around it is executed properly.The cynic inside of me thinks that, at a time when George Lucas and co. were blasting away at the cinema screen via the 'Star Wars' films - essentially using outer space as a playground for all manner of shoot-outs and interplanetary crafts hurtling around the place at top speed - Ridley Scott and his team were doing something calmer and more effective much more quietly. In 'Alien', space is a bleak, lonely place - its ships, like the transport vessels on the open oceans of Earth hundreds of years ago, hulk peacefully through tremendous fields of nothingness, its crew eager to get home, its journey devoid of notoriety, its androids not quirky and funny but potentially deadly.The film begins with some seemingly unnecessary tracking shots through the corridors of the ship itself, the Nostromo - it appears empty, and surprisingly narrow for its size. The film appears to be introducing to the audience the venue for the fight which is set to follow. On the bridge, some mechanical whirring brings a computer to life and a screen seems to then uncannily 'interact' with a stationary helmet positioned on top of a seat. We then play witness to the crew of seven waking up from some kind of enhanced sleep for long journeys. What becomes evident here and in the following scenes is that there is no clear lead - a captain, played by Tom Skerritt, might fit the bill; so too might an engineer named Parker (Yaphet Kotto), whose qualm with some kind of futuristic payment scheme the film seems to think is important and is something we expect to be resolved later on.Otherwise, things are fairly anonymous - 'Alien' keeping its cards close to its chest. When the crew try to figure out why they've been awoken prematurely, given there is no sign of Earth, the film positions the character of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) nearer the back of the bridge and away from the consoles the navigators check for answers. What the crew come up with is a repetitive signal radiating out from a nearby moon every twelve seconds, and conspire to investigate it as per space protocol. In this space-set universe, and unlike Lucas', mankind has seemingly succeeded in avoiding contact with lots of different galactic creatures - convergence with a foreign body not of Earth's proportion is a rare thing.Still with no clear lead, a gang of volunteers venture out into a storm after the ship has landed on the moon - the inhospitable weather, violent winds and unwelcoming atmosphere conspiring to act as a kind of warning or prelude for the situation to come. Having bravely nominated himself to be amongst the first to investigate, and then to go below-deck once they discover a shipwreck, John Hurt's character Kane presents himself to the audience as a protagonist of sorts: the explorer, the discoverer - what he discovers are thousands of small eggs and then something else besides when he gets a little too close.Back on board the Nostromo, the events which play out for the rest of the film have etched themselves into a kind of cinematic legend - is there a person alive who does not know how the biology of the face-hugger works? Or what to expect when you're not expecting? Apparently paralysed by his venture, our volunteer hero Kane is seemingly out of the equation as two others in the form of the aforementioned Captain Dallas and a science officer named Ash (Ian Holm) step up to take his place. But why does the film think it important for Dallas to digress said officer was only instated on the mission mere days before disembarkation? Saints be praised, Kane appears to wake up and we have our lead back...The genius behind 'Alien' within the confines of its genre and what it's attempting to do lies in what director Ridley Scott does with what he has at his disposal. Much later on, when we sense the creature is in a large storage hold with one of the crewmembers, Scott uses the water dripping down from a vent shaft high in the ceiling to create a leathery sound as it rebounds off a crewman's cap, and we're never quite sure if we're hearing that or the monster's own limbs wriggling into an attack position.As a setting, the old beaten up Nostromo itself makes for the perfect locality - there is certainly something in the way it hulks towards us in the film's opening few shots, heavy in the load it's carrying, and we sense it has seen better days. Its interior lighting is a little funky, illuminating some parts of some corridors and not others, as would reflect its deterioration over time. It feels like an unreliable host, even more so when it is damaged upon landing on the mysterious moon, and this paranoia of the on-board technology betraying us later occurs.Simplicity is the key to 'Alien' - its three-act structure, the first of which culminates with the egg discovery; the second of which concludes with the alien's birth and the third of which concludes with the biggest bang of them all, before a brief postface, is executed brilliantly. Reputation and place in popular culture aside, see 'Alien' if you have not already done so.",7,1,2,6 April 2019
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Big, bold and bloody but not that brilliant.
","It's not that Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a bad film as much as it is a bad Tim Burton film. The film looks good visually and is very ominous in its cinematography and use of a grotty and bleak location but most of this is what we come to expect from Burton and is nothing more than a sheen on a surface when broken down and thought about. Most of Burton's films that do not contain a certain amount of substance really rely on the visual; Sleepy Hollow and Mars Attacks! are two good examples with Batman, Batman Returns and Ed Wood being films that looked pretty ordinary but actually felt as if they were about something; about people and predicaments and coming through in the end. Sweeney Todd is one of the former; iffy, visually attractive efforts but 'not much else going on' films.A few years prior to Sweeney Todd, Joel Schumacher made The Phantom of the Opera, another musical adaptation for the silver screen. There are connections between the two. Both are films about individuals whom have suffered in the past and have been scarred so badly, either physically or psychologically, they take it upon themselves to inhabit a certain 'space' in which they are able to remain, cut off from the outside world as they reflect their social misfit status. What's interesting about The Phantom and Sweeney Todd is their dwelling. Both the opera house and the barber shop offer members of the public a certain 'service'. At the time of The Phantom of the Opera, the opera house (along with the theatre) was very much a means of entertainment for a night out; a place that has since been associated with visitors whom are sophisticated or cultured.A barbers shop on the other hand can be seen as a place in which the tenants go in order to save themselves a job. There is something nonchalant about a man going to a barbers to have someone else shave him; a certain amount of risk about entrusting another individual with something as potentially dangerous as a razor so close to one's face. In this sense, the spaces Todd and The Phantom inhabit are somewhat associated with the upper class or the nonchalant and are spaces the respected anti-heroes turn into places of horror and terror with their anger and hatred born out of their own social role as a misfit. I liked The Phantom of the Opera slightly more; it felt more heartfelt and revolved around a romance more so than it did a tale of revenge as seen in Sweeney Todd.So if the unique selling point here is that Sweeney Todd is a revenge film, incorporating the genre of the musical and throwing in lashings of gore at the same time, does it work? The short answer is 'not really'. This hybridity of the musical, a casual and usually uplifting genre that falls into the non-realist sense combined with the gritty, realist revenge arc complete with lots of gore does not work here. The film sees Sweeney arrive back in London following years away after a conviction he was innocent of in the first place. This charge was related to the 'crime' of being in love with someone that someone else of a greater power was also in love with. That man is Judge Turpin (Rickman), the slimy Brit-cast baddie who has an equally slimy sidekick in Beadle, Timothy Spall doing what he did in the recent Harry Potter films to reasonably good effect once again, so we've seen it before.Johnny Depp's Sweeney Todd is a follow on from his 'funny' mumbling character Captain Jack Sparrow but less Keith Richards and more Charlie Manson. Todd is a changed man after his stint away from England for punishment of being with this other woman but he's changed for the worse and it's not long before he gets the blood lust that will drive him to his inevitable show down with enemy Judge Turpin. The film is very basic in its idea and set up and a lot of it is music and songs but while there's nothing wrong with that, it's the little things that niggle. The shaving show down with Pirelli (Baron-Cohen), who is a negative Italian stereotype in himself, acts as an introduction to Todd's barber skills and no more. There is also a particularly unpleasant 'joke' involving his child assistant and his constantly cut fingers.But Sweeney Todd is the sort of film that places young children in a position for the sake of laughs when one child is on the floor drunk later on and it just feels out of place. Amongst all the stereotypes and the using of Brits as the villains is an American playing Todd, complete with a white streak in his hair amongst a lot of black in a desperate attempt to visually show us there might be some good or 'light' in him amongst all the 'evil'. The sub narrative of Anthony (Campbell Bower) loving and chasing Johanna (Wisener) is daft and degrading, Johanna being relegated to the role of 'damsel in distress/locked in a tower' as her hero/lover stands, sings and watches her from below. Later, she is moved to an asylum of all places and that's the end of that mini-story.Additionaly, why does Burton shoot his wife Bonham-Carter in an objective fashion as she pours out of a corset? Similarly to Len Wiseman and the Underworld films, we're not watching the film to see your wife presented in a provocative fashion. If people being killed and served as pies as later on two potential kid killers roam the sewers searching for a lost boy sounds like fun then you might enjoy Sweeney Todd but it is a rather daft and lifeless film directed by a man that you expect better from.",6,1,2,3 November 2008
The Polar Express," Manipultive and with an overriding issue of visuals over all else; the film has, admittedly, a child-like enthusiasm difficult to brush off but it's all fairly pedestrian.
","It is difficult not to pencil The Polar Express in as more style and effects over substance; but boy, what style and effects it's got. Witness, if you will, the sequence signalling the end of the film's set-up and systematic commencement of the protagonist's journey proper; a sequence following that of a magical steam train whisking it's way down into a suburban street and then off again once the formalities have been taken care of. Witness the way in which the many windows to the many carriages wonderfully sync up with the ground as it slowly chugs away from the curb as if it were leaving a station; the way the bright golds radiating from the lighting within each carriage to each window reflects onto the brilliant white lawns covered in heavy snow, each yellow rectangle sticking in perfect tandem as it moves off. Never mind the meetings with Santa Claus and never mind the 'state of the art' motion capture technology on show throughout, the true beauty of this 2004 piece lies not with the residing characteristics of the beast nor the places it goes, but with the more simplistic little 'events' or 'happenings' such as the aforementioned examples. Therein lie the reasons to feel both good and at-once apprehensive about the film, a film all but indebted to its special effects and therefore often feeling the need to fall back on the sheer spectacle of the world it's depicting so as to get across the sense we've actually gone somewhere.The film was directed by a certain Robert Zemeckis, whose 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a crisp example of how effects can create a world around a central character's plight whilst complimenting the central tract rather than draw attention away from it. Tom Hanks voices a young boy living in a rich American neighbourhood somewhere in the 1950's , a kid with a loving family; a big house and a little sister. The young boy is growing up, and reading of mall based Santa's striking in the newspapers as well as discovering nuggets of information that places such as The North Pole cannot harbour human beings, his belief in the man is on the slope downwards. Late on Christmas Eve, another Hanks character, on board the titular Polar Express, whooshes down and parks outside the young boy's house – next stop: The North Pole, in what is an attempt by those on the other side to re-instill belief.In essence, that is as advanced it gets in terms of narrative; the film easing into a grove driven solely by the special effects of getting there and then briefly staying there before completing the circular journey and arriving back to a warm Christmas morning. Along the way, one of the characters has no ticket; the train itself does not have any breaks, it conks out on one occasion and there is an uncanny interaction with a homeless gentleman. There are a number of other kids on board, with them arriving this bizarre class tract to do with people from varying class levels all occupying different class compartments, but each coming together at the end as one happy congregation occupying the same realm, even those of whom come from 'the wrong side of the tracks'. Zemeckis takes the opportunity in working with this technology to recreate certain sequences from his past work, one of which is lifted from Forrest Gump but sees a feather replaced by one of those aforementioned tickets, and he even finds time to pay reference to the daring train cart negotiating that made up the finale of Back to the Future: Part III - complete with 'I've always wanted to do that!' line once in the engine proper. They do nothing but have us wish we were watching those films instead.Nearer the end of the journey there is a steep drop in the tracks resulting in the train snowballing downhill, something shot from the very front of the vehicle and instilling this unnecessary roller-coaster aesthetic to proceedings reiterating what little it lacks in most film making departments but excels at in terms of spectacle. For the final final act, the train arrives in The North Pole to a pastiche of that Christmas-time Coca Cola advertisement you get on televisions. Then, it is revealed Santa's workshop is run by elves who sound like they've seen one too many New York City-set gangster movies and, in a creepy turn, have these tiny video cameras in the bedrooms of each kid in the world so as to check on bad behaviour. Admittedly, the 'permanant record' idea is good value and the big spinning globe allowing you access it all is neat.One is tempted to compare it to the likes of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, or indeed James Cameron's more recent Avatar; films of which did not exist until the time in which they did due to the unavailability of the technology at hand required to build the worlds envisaged. Had one attempted to produce the film twenty or so years previously, the effects will often have looked stodgy; but if they were backed up by narrative and characterisation, those would be the limits of people's criticisms. Here, one is constantly pestered by the effects and how impressive they are, as well as how unimpressive it is to see them essentially act as dressing to weak arcs of self-discovery. I found those other two examples dull and lifeless; similarly, Zemeckis' prior work, in these post-Polar Express domains, have been the often woeful and tonally broken Beowulf and A Christmas Carol – in comparison, The Polar Express has a certain energy to it and is easier to watch. It would be true to say that as the 1910s merged into the 1920s, and audiences demanded narrative over spectacle, so are we going in the opposite direction ninety years on, and it is a sentiment epitomised in films such as The Polar Express.",6,1,2,16 December 2011
The Town," Intelligent drama combining an engaging romance with a police investigation and a criminal gang's disenchantment with one another, culminating in a thoroughly competent piece.
","Some extraordinary statistics greet us upon the beginning of Ben Affleck's film The Town, statistics more broadly linked to that of career choices those whom inhabit the film's set city of Boston are seemingly limited to. Specifically, if you're not a criminal or a thief or an armoured truck targeting bandit then there aren't many other things that you are. Like the lone monument, or cenotaph, which is the first image we see, standing tall amidst a sky full of clouds eerily rushing by, it is a career choice placed at the forefront of a sea of despair or despondency; a lifestyle perpetrated by a gloomy backdrop within which it seems there is precious little choice. Affleck's film is a studious observation on the limits a group of men face in this regard, a team of crooks who take down various instalments of cash held within banks and other such places connected to that of money exchange; people that are caught up in this city and this choice of life, again amidst a dank and unwelcoming backdrop of despair. The pillar appears as more than scant iconography, it is an item Affleck utilises and revisits on a number of occasions in the form of inserting it back into proceedings as characters progress and appear to want to escape onto something else; that monument coming and coming again as the insatiable force that is 'the life' drags our man backwards and backwards and back into the mire of it all.Affleck here assumes the role of young Irish-American crook Doug MacRay; a young, pent-up but brutally methodical young heister with a father in prison, a mother, who he holds bittersweet memories of, whom is dead and is currently stuck in what is an unnurtured and unfulfilling relationship with a co-worker's sister named Krista (Lively). MacRay is involved in a crew with three others, one of which is Jeremy Renner's James Coughlin, of whom is the more sociopathic and violent of the group; a man whose credentials and legal situation in that he is a step away from serious penal related consequences is later verbally highlighted to us by the authorities. With Coughlin and MacRay is Albert Magloan (Slaine) and Desmond Elden (Burke), whom form the rest of the gang. Their jolting introduction is the robbing of a bank in masks and cloaks which typify evil in their demonic appearance; the preceding sequence as they go over things one final time complete with intense contingencies allowing for brief glances over one or two of the men as trepidation creeps sparingly over their faces and we're informed that here is a film not preoccupied with the slam-bang thrill of a robbery or a heist pertained by just anybody, but a group of men thinking and cultivating something through.Ensuing complications during the opening sees English actress Rebecca Hall's bank employee Claire Keesey taken hostage, her frightful reaction to the F.B.I.'s questioning firmly establishing how deeply the experience affected her and as of the moment tags the crooks with an easy labelling of blind to all emotion, nameless, anonymous thugs without much due concern to others. The film goes some lengths to deconstruct this notion, a getting under of the proverbial skin and demythifying the gangsters whilst keeping all the police procedural stuff led by John Hamm's agent Adam Frawley deliberately quick; methodical; cold; metallic and emotionally lacking. As we come to bond more with MacRay, as he himself infiltrates Keesey's life on his crew's orders to check up on her problematic relationship in regards to them, we come to somewhat reverse our view to form more of an understanding with him; his life and their intimate bond. An early incident in their relationship sees MacRay utilise his criminal mindset to get one back on a group of hoodlums whom previously wronged Keesey, challenging us to get behind Affleck's character and exemplifying his disdain towards such people as officers of the law stay stuck on the back-burner going through the motions.The film is rich in its finer things. Pete Postlethwaite delivers a stern and aggressive, in all the right ways, performance as local mob boss Fergus Colm, who has seen mostly everything and now works out of a florists. There is an affecting sub-plot to do with MacRay coming to tie up a bond with his father, who himself offers a further example of the film's demythification element when he confirms to our Doug that his mother was nary the proverbial angel he always saw her as - thus underpinning the film's core thesis. There is also a quite wonderful sequence between two characters, one overly violent and whose background at this point is occupied by deathly gravestones in a cemetery,; the other, having reiterated his desire to leave this life behind, shot to a backdrop of a community centre suggesting a straighter, more legitimate desire for a lifestyle possibly in which the helping of others features. Sadly, all appears lost and the brawling results in the would-be 'straighter' of the two men quite literally being dragged back to the 'side' of the nastier criminal: graveyard infused background et al.People are surprised at the competence of director Ben Affleck, here doubling up as the co-screenwriter as well. Glancing back at Affleck's acting credits, the man has most certainly worked with some well known and rather well renowned directors of both his and our time; John Woo and Frankenheimer on some occasions, the likes of Gus van Sant, Martin Brest and, while there are many more people who admire him than I do, Kevin Smith on others. It's true to say that he hasn't necessarily caught the majority of these director's during either of their finest hours, or indeed worked with them on their best work, but if the man has observed and listened and formulated the ideas and methods that he's most probably put into practise for something such as The Town, then who's complaining?",7,0,0,16 March 2011
Closer," As the film wears on, the script and plot wear off.
","This film was a huge disappointment. The cast was heavy with Hollywood stars and although I'm not really into following actors and actresses' lives and keeping in touch with what they're latest films are, I at least knew each of the four faces in the film. Funnily enough, though, this is actually one of the numerous things that contribute to Closer's downfall.Although the beginning and most of the actual film is clean cut and very sharp, everything seems a little too fast; the dialogue, camera and characters snap back at one another before we've even got a chance to absorb what they've just said. This is a persistent annoyance with Closer. During some of the scenes you actually ask your self just what in the hell is actually going on. The film starts off fairly simply but launches itself into a barrage of double crosses, broken hearts and false promises the characters make between themselves. This got very confusing and the dialogue did start to falter here once it realised that it needed to string together some actual DIALOGUE rather than meaningless, romantic clap trap two people spout to one another. I had to ask myself 'If they weren't big-shot Hollywood actors, would I really give a hell!?' When the film runs out of steam a little after about 30 and 70 minutes respectively, the character Dan (Law) seems to just suddenly, from absolutely nowhere, come out with a crazy revelation that turns the film completely on its head and starts it down another road. At one point, he admits to something to the person he supposedly loves and then that, itself, spawns another series of events that are completely random and just seem forced. This felt like a cheap get out clause in the script and I felt rather insulted that the film would use such an underhand, weak plot point to boost the film along. This is actually where the story falls apart and 'Closer', as I said, slowly contributes to its own downfall.Like I said; if they weren't Hollywood big-shots, would we even care? What if they were nobody actors acting on a shoestring budget? This film would have disappeared the day after it was released.As the film enters its home straight, I kind of lost count at the amount of times each character told each other that they loved them. The script seemed to be constructed around the principal of: 'I love you. Pardon? I love you. Pardon? I love you. Pardon? I love you. Pardon?' and I actually starting laughing out loud whenever Larry (Owen) or Anna (Roberts) said this phrase as it was utterly pathetic. Clearly, none of these characters love each other at all.Although I would have loved to have given this film a lower rating, the actors do well with the worn script that they're given and I'm not going to grumble too much at a film that has a particularly long scene involving Natalie Portman scantly dressed as a stripper but Closer really doesn't deserve the plaudits its getting nor does it the ones that it's already received.",5,1,2,5 November 2006
Taxi Driver," Take time to hitch a ride with this eerie Scorsese masterpiece.
","What a wonderful and timeless film Taxi Driver is, a film that delves into the human mind and gets stuck into the psychology behind certain living conditions and past events that still haunt. The film was written by a man then on the brink in Paul Schrader, but a man with a brilliant mind all the same whilst it was directed by one of America's more up and coming contemporary filmmakers in Martin Scorsese. The two minds come together and Taxi Driver is the result, one of my personal favourites and a landmark of sorts in modern cinema.I wonder if Taxi Driver is one of, if not the, closest examples of an American film that is an out-and-out art film. A film that is shot on everyday locales with no intent whatsoever to prolong any sort of cause and affect driven narrative and quite deliberately focusing on the development of one individual who shares every single scene the movie presents us with, bar one. It's the sort of film that could very well have been happening as it was being shot and certainly, with events involving a certain John Hinckley in 1981, dug so deep as to inspire real life. In this sense Taxi Driver could well be compared to certain famous and recognised films found in certain cannons; films like post-war Italy's 'The Bicycle Thieves' and Mexico's neo-realistic 'The Forgotten Ones'. Shooting into the 21st Century, we have a recent effort from Mali entitled 'Bamako', again a film shot on the streets with no real narrative to speak of but a progression of a situation driven by politics and study.Taxi Driver's anchor is its study of its locale as seen through the eyes of its lead character, Travis Bickle whom is played in a globally recognised performance by Robert De Niro, himself on the verge of greatness amongst Hollywood's acting circles. The space in which Bickle inhabits could be seen as a 'post-war' space; a space of which has become decayed and of a lower 'quality' through the government's focus on Vietnam happening several thousand miles away, something few people believed in as it wore on. As a result, the government's attention to its own home has waned and the metropolis that is New York City has become what it has become according to Travis himself, who incidentally chastises a politician for the state as to which the city has got to.Travis Bickle is a lone soul in a setting complete with the sorts of individuals that make it more unbearable. There is a lot of gazing in the film, indeed the second shot of the entire film, and the first that doesn't establish the title of the film, is Travis' eyes following something as the film's theme plays over the image. Slyly, it is a shot at the very beginning establishing the general theme of observing what's around you and figuring a subjective viewpoint. What Travis sees is what he tells us through his diary entries and voice-overs as he drives past the subjects late at night, going through a list of derogatory words. Additionally, his fellow taxi drivers talk in an un-pc manner and the resentment is consistent.But Bickle's perspective is only as distorted as it's ever going to be. Travis doesn't choose to visit museums in order to observe works or art or indeed go to the cinema in order to watch the latest movie in an attempt to escape life for a brief few hours; instead, he delves deeper into the grime and watches pornographic films in-between bumping into underage prostitutes and their pimps as well as organising deals with gun runners. What Travis believes to be the one shining light amidst all the garbage lies in Betsy (Shepherd), a woman working as a campaign volunteer for the mayoral candidate Charles Palantine (Harris) and the same individual Travis gave a lift to. His attraction to this girl brings about some of the more harrowing scenes the film delivers and moves the film, perhaps somewhat unfortunately, into a study of the stalker. But that only runs from him getting her out on a date to a certain phone call that even the camera is supposedly too embarrassed to eavesdrop on.Scorsese shoots the film in a grimy and gritty fashion, using low angles and utilising the steam that pours out the vents dotted around the streets - an open sewer indeed. A lot of the film is shot at night; the daytime is almost an escape from the madness we're being forced to focus on through Bickle's own unhinged perspective. Bernard Hermann's score sets a perfect pitch for the film during the opening shots of the taxi gliding by, combining a smooth and easy to listen to jazz melody with a more brutal, more hard hitting grungy theme that beautifully sets in motion Bickle's overall mindset of this 'one thing on the surface' but is able to change into something far more violent all the same. Taxi Driver is one of those films anyone serious about cinema should see and it has remained right near the top of my favourites ever since I first saw it a couple of years ago and was blown away.",10,0,1,28 February 2009
Shutter Island," Odd little Cast Away-Invasion of the Body Snatchers mash up which works a lot better than it has any right to.
","Is Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island a police procedural thriller? A horror movie? Is it a film about someone offered the chance to this time uncover (and thus save) those being held against their will by an exterior force seemingly ungoverned by the rest of a broader representation of a community? Well, yes and no and then yes again and then no and then........well, to go on would be to reveal too much. Rest assured, the film is deceptively simplistic but at the same time non-cryptically complicated – or should that be deceptively complicated and non-cryptically simplistic? It is a film about a lead plunged into a situation that sees him with the capability to help a batch of helpless people trapped on the titular Shutter Island who're falling victim to all manner of sordidness, this at a time when recent demons of having stumbled across a Nazi concentration camp long after it was too late to do anything still resonate. At least, for the most part it is a film about this – irregardless of the bumpy, rickety road full of holes and lumps Scorsese takes us down, Shutter Island suffices as a piece of drama you're be hard pressed not to recommend.The film follows a Bostonian man named Teddy Daniels, played with an impeccably balanced amount of remorse; fear and anger throughout by that of Leonardo Di Caprio. Daniels is a U.S. Marshall, and is assigned to the titular Shutter Island located off the coast of off Boston Harbor. The island is a place not unfamiliar to grey weather and storms, although rather more so to people stepping off its lone mode of transportation both to and from it in the form of ferry and onto its ground by those who think they can come along and boss about the individuals running it. Daniels is one of these people; a man there to look for someone based on the island who rather recently simply disappeared overnight, but not there to take orders from Ben Kingsley's chief doctor in residence, John Cawley. The two men and their antagonism is apparent from the beginning: where Cawley gives a brief outline of the sorts of people he has on this island of containment and rehabilitation, he is quick to label them 'patients' present to be cured, with Daniels equally quick to counteract with his view that they are 'prisoners' omnipresent so as to be punished for crimes.Daniels nurses some painful events from his past, namely that of that aforementioned wartime discovery of a German concentration camp and the fact that he recently lost his wife. Daniels is there with a fresh face in U.S. Marshalling: that of Mark Ruffalo's Chuck Aule; a guy who verbally establishes Daniels' reputation as a guy to be reckoned with in this career field as they chug on over through the mist and mire to the island. Initial clashings between the somewhat gruff and more carefree investigative duo of Aule and Daniels and that of Cawley and his German psychiatrist Jeremiah Naehring (von Sydow) escalate beyond mere face value; appearance and the nature of how it is they carry out their investigative work: getting out and about searching for clues consequently lined up alongside that of using studies in psychology to uncover truths about people and past situations 'prisoners' or 'patients' were dramatically involved in.Daniels begins to suspect the powers that be on the island are holding back on information, and he launches a crusade going against all the location's rules to try and figure out a bigger picture he believes is at foot – something which intensifies when the person shows up anyway and the film tries to tap into the paranoia and fear rife throughout the respective era in America born out of U.F.O. cover-up conspiracies and Communism infiltration fears. Like his 1976 film Taxi Driver, Scorsese is more than apt at distilling the reality of a lead's world through his own broken subconscious; that is to say, constructing a view of a place (or person, as was evident in The King of Comedy) so intensified that we are propelled into seeing the same object in the same fashion as we're launched into this lead's life and mind. There is about enough substance to keep this 2010 effort grounded throughout, the deft touches implemented during the course of the film allowing a continuous flow of cause, effect and reveal which adds to a burning sense of horror and things seemingly become clearer.Without Scorsese's deft hand, the film may very well have broken down into farce long before the end credits and one fantastic example of his ability to just move and weave things along is evident when one of the island's chief wardens picks the lead up whilst he was out and about by himself in the forests of the locale following a string of 'reveals' which apparently tell of a greater, darker secret the place holds. Upon picking him up, we are suddenly aware of just how akin to a Nazi Gestapo uniform this warden's clothing actually looks and we think back to if it had always looked like that or whether the film is just toying with us in the immediate present. The film is not the great character study, nor extended piece of narrative film-making, that pieces like 1995's Casino or 1980's Raging Bull were; films playing out across this exasperated amount of time as tensions and distrust boil over between people we never particularly liked. Moreover, it is a genre piece feeding off twists and turns which we accept in a film made by someone we do not feel uneasy in the hand of – the likes of which need not be avoided.",7,0,1,29 February 2012
Life of Pi," You Can't Herd Cats
","Have you ever actually physically seen a tiger? I had the tremendous fortune to see one once, at a zoo, concealed behind what I presume was a fairly thick wall of glass. They are sprightly animals: expressive faces, strangely full of both confidence and apprehension; eyes which cut right through you when they stare you down. Their agility is quite striking, gracious, but of course deadly, in their hopping and pouncing to and from their chosen platforms. Between the open-air monkey enclosure; the penguin performance and the tarantula on one of the zoo keeper's arms, the tiger was certainly one of the highlights.Broadly speaking, the premise to 'Life of Pi' is that someone, a teenager, is stuck on a small life raft with one of these beasts in the middle of the ocean. The tiger cannot eat the boy, otherwise it will starve, but of course it doesn't know this, and the boy, who is of course stranded, must fish for food to sustain both his own life but also to keep the tiger at bay. Ang Lee, directing, spins a nimble tale out this idea, borrowing, in terms of imagery and general approach, from some of the more successful films of this stock from recent years: 'Forrest Gump' and 'Amélie', for instance, while the sense of being stranded in one place and having to rely on resourcefulness calls to mind 'Cast Away'. You know the types I mean: slick, good looking and colourful dramas which glide along at their own pace. Fans of its genre will enjoy it, but there is a little bit more in there besides in terms of its exploring things to do with morality; evolution and where exactly God sits in the world.The film begins in the present-day, and so broadly speaking consists of one, long flashback, with the titular Pi, a man of Indian descent, in his Canadian home speaking to a struggling author (Rafe Spall). The author is looking for something with some spark to put down into a book, and he seems to think he's found it in the titular Pi, who experienced what can only be described as a unique experience in his younger life. We flash right the way back to India during Pi's youth, wherein his family runs, in actual fact, a zoo. But amidst all the animals on display, hypnotically put to us via the opening credits sequence, it is the tiger which attracts Pi's attention the most - beautiful but deadly, elegant in its movement and monitoring of its surroundings; fur like velvet you can only stroke when it is under anaesthetic.In a sense, much of what Pi encounters during this opening act in India has little to do with what the film will come to depict, in that he excels somewhat at mathematics at school; has difficulty communicating with girls and swims a bit, but it presents him as a human-being and a boy who, like any boy, has these experiences at school and home. At the zoo, his father forces him to watch the aforementioned tiger consume a goat when Pi becomes a little too enamoured with the creature, and this kills something inside of him he cannot quite define, although to what extent it had to do with anything later on is unclear. Perhaps his experience at sea was the catharsis he needed to rekindle his lost feelings, but it couldn't be as simple as that, could it?Lee moves the film into the second act with a dramatic shipwreck sequence when Pi's father feels the family set-up and all involved must move across the ocean to Canada; the going down of the liner and our perspective of it eerily, and I'm sure not wholly accidentally, calling to mind the earlier imagery of Pi's father swimming in the crystal-clear waters of a Parisian pool with the bright blue sky in the background. From here, the meat of the film unfolds as Pi and a scatter-shot crew of animals from varying points on the food-chain uneasily congregate on a lifeboat and are left to float on their own. The passage allows the film to mediate on a variety of things, but only via the perspective of a young boy who has happened to read up on the world's religion, but has also lost everything he had.Consequently, the film teases us with a Darwinian plight involving the animals which, unsurprisingly, goes the way of the fittest. There is a tantalising moment whereby an Orangutan, the closest to human-beings in an evolutionary sense, seems to realise it needs to put on a life-jacket. Pi confronts God via prayer when he is forced into terminating the life of a fish to survive, something which drags us back to the world of the Old Testament when people were forced into the barbarous action of slaughtering bovine animals in order to live before using God to justify it and writing it all down in Leviticus, a sort of apology to themselves. He then does so again via a means he at least thinks is more physical when a tropical storm strikes the boat and we are, again, reminded of how people in dire situations used to put their circumstance and the natural world around them down to a deity punishing and/or testing them.The film is all at once a disaster movie; a comedy; a biography and a rumination on life and the world, but it is never enough of any one of these things to have it feel contained or constricted to the generic demands of either of these things. Instead, 'Life of Pi' is a refreshing and often exhilarating drama with a bite as powerful as any wild cat's.",7,1,1,25 August 2019
Tangled," In spite of often paling in comparison to most other recent animations, Tangled is a charming enough romp which ticks enough boxes.
","Disney's latest is a feast for the senses in as much one cannot deny its colour; exuberance; 'crack on with it' attitude and generally fun, frantic nature - but this is all it is in regards to that age-old 'feast for the senses' line, as I cannot say I felt a genuine nor heartfelt taking to it like I can to some of their other works and nor can I muster a reaction along the lines of being particularly moved. The film is sassy and effervescent, a film in the Disney mould of its depicting the adventures of a young, often socially starved by her father/mother, heroine getting caught up in all sorts of plots and pratfalls with a range of oddball folk along the lines of Aladdin; Pocahontas and The Little Mermaid resulting in change and great adventure. The film follows that of the Mandy Moore voiced Rapunzel, a young girl who lives with her mother and steadily approaches her eighteenth birthday. Only, she doesn't actually live with her mother but a faux-incarnation of a mothering figure – the dastardly Gothel (Murhpy), who begins the film as a haggard elderly lady before finding a magical flower enabling her to become young and stay young. In order to do so, she must constantly harnesses the power which comes about to be imbued within that of the infant Rapunzel's hair, a catch which is brought about when Rapunzel's REAL mother harnesses the life from the flower herself so as to keep her alive during childbirth. With Moore's character possessing a sort of trichological Holy Grail, and having been stolen away from her true parents, of whom look suspiciously like the king and queen out of 1959's Sleeping Beauty, she finds herself locked away in a tower by herself at the bereft of the person she presumes to be her true guardian.The heroine on this occasion isn't the best of young female leads that the American animated movie making corporation have ever come up with. Cut from a stone more akin to that of a recent, Disney-mass produced 'conveyor belt' generation of young women along the lines of Hannah Montana and Selena Gomez, Rapunzel is a po-faced; 'Best. Day. Ever!' quipping poster child incarnation more broadly representative of this and is disappointing in this light. She is, however, ridiculously talented in an array of fields which range from astronomy (perhaps at a time before most astronomers did what they did?) to dress-making; her burgeoning young adulthood cranking things up a gear when she desires to step outside of the proverbial bubble, much to Gothel's disdain when she realises the magic she possesses will go with her.In essence, we have a film about a young girl wanting to grow up coming up against an elderly woman wanting to grow down – that is to say stay young. Said dynamic brings about the film's best song, 'mother knows best', in a sort of verbal psychoanalytical orgy of why young Rapunzel should stay locked in the tower with her pet chameleon rather than get out and explore as she approaches adulthood like she wants to. Unfortunately, and on a much more detrimental note, we have had the likes of Black Swan released in 2011; the 'sordid' mother-daughter relationship here paling in comparison to Aronofsky's forcing drama with the whole thing, of which plays such an important role in the piece overall, landing at our feet more damply than what would have been away from exposure to said piece.Respite in Rapunzel's world arrives with that of Flynn Rider (Levi), a cocksure young thief who's a lot more handsome than his two criminal cohorts and manages to steal some valuables from a castle and get away again before having the gall to double cross his partners in crime and make off. Flynn stumbles upon Repunzel's little hideaway in amidst the hills and forests and renders it his own to lie low – and that's when all the trouble starts. The sub-plot to do with the kingdom's chase, eventually led by a cross pollination between a horse and a bloodhound named Maximus, whose clothing sticks true to his name and sees him decked out in Roman Centurion-esque garb, to get the valuables back and Flynn's own double crossed friends chasing him down does well to intermingle with the central tract of Rapunzel's coming of age story and what eventually transpires on that strand.We enjoy Rider and Repunzel's coming together extending beyond that of the tower's domain, something which kicks off an adventure similar to that of when Princess Jasmine and Aladdin first met and came to bond – the gimmick here seeing neither of them know of the other one's true-to-life foundations in royalty. I like the fact that her aforementioned trusty pet chameleon, Pascal, is mute; thus, I make it, rendering Tangled the first Disney film since that of Pocahontas to encompass creatures of the animal world whom do not speak. Where we might have had a hair-brained, fast-talking animal sidekick doing whatever, Pascal cuts a silent and often cheeky looking figure – a character who's all hand gestures and facial expressions, a character built on comedy of a more physical nature and making him infinitely funnier than a what might have been. The film, branded proudly by that of Disney themselves, is their fiftieth; if the run were a so-far indelible cricket innings by that of an individual batsmen, then Tangled is the nick along the ground for four runs through the slip cauldron thus proudly bringing up the half-century and enabling the player to raise his bat more than it is the imperious cover drive to seal a landmark. That said, the film comes with a buoyant energy; a charming love story and a fun chase narrative on top of a fair few laughs that compensate for a few lacklustre songs – it is worth a go.",6,4,10,9 December 2011
Barry Lyndon," When you think of 'Kubrick', you should think of 'Lyndon'.
","When thinking of the directing legend Stanley Kubrick, some of the films that may spring to mind could be his sci-fi '2001: A Space Odyssey'; maybe his ground breaking and controversial 'A Clockwork Orange' or maybe even his wonderful turn at horror in 'The Shining'. One film that perhaps won't immediately hit you is this one; 'Barry Lyndon' and this is a great shame.The one thing Barry Lyndon has going for it all the way through is the feeling of luck/chance. The film is impossible to predict and this instantly makes it good as it grabs you and draws you into its world. It also does this with its wonderful collection of 'mise-en-scene' on display. The costumes are out of this world, the continually mole-faced characters are delightful as they are juxtaposed for their time and the settings are as consistently different and refreshing as each other.When I was watching this film, it felt like some sort of gritty crime drama set a few hundred years ago. Lyndon's climb up the aristocracy's hierarchy sneaks up on you a little bit as you realise that he's got to make something of his life given the position he's now facing. All this is kicked off following a nicely done and particularly moving love story early on. The brutish, overly confident British soldier/captain has spoiled Lyndon's love interest and everything is set up superbly for the actual incident to happen. Once the journey starts, you can't tell which way it's going. While totally engrossing and maintaining that luck/chance feeling throughout the first hour, 'Lyndon' sucks you in and doesn't exhale for a moment. Everything that happens is an experience and keeps you interested as to what the outcome might be.What also struck me about the film is that at times, you have no idea what the characters are even saying. From memory, the characters interact in German and some form of 'Prussian' and the gyp is: there are no subtitles (!) However, this isn't a bad thing in fact it adds to the experience. It would be spoiled if some tacky looking 1970's style font popped up telling what it is everyone is saying. It gives you the feel that you're actually there with them and it's great.Unfortunately, no film is without its flaws be it length or otherwise and the film suffers from this. During 'part 2' of the film, and especially during his married life; the film falters. The character settle down and it feels like he's reached the end of his journey until something pretty unpredictable and shocking kick starts it again, but this is quite a while later. There isn't much energy in the film, the narration dries up and the settings stays the same. In fact, it's rather dull at this point.But, as I've mentioned, something kick starts it again and it's back on the road of unpredictability and anguish.Definitely one of the most under-rated films of the 1970's and shouldn't be forgotten when thinking of Kubrick's best films.",7,2,6,2 September 2006
Full Metal Jacket," Rather empty and meandering exercise that spends about two hours just to tell us that 'the Vietnam War was rather unpleasant'.
","Full Metal Jacket is uneven and oddly uninteresting at the best of times, muddling whatever study of war it wants to make and substituting what should be quality, quality scenes of great drama with iffy bits of 'this and that' action as soldiers sit around, maybe coming under fire, shout a lot and then quite possibly do something stupid enough to get themselves shot. Full Metal Jacket tries to cram in as much as possible to do with the Vietnam War, as it shoots from basic training; to graduation from that; to Vietnam itself; to the battlefield on which the film will conclude whatever documentation, rather than study, it has made. At the be all and end all of it, it's underwhelming at how all this ground and all this distance is covered with not much product at the pinnacle.There are scenes that you feel should work more than you feel they actually do. One such incidence involves a long take of the lead character walking down a muddied Vietnamese road with someone as tanks and trucks drive by beside them. The lead and the other soldier are talking about whereabouts and locations as they glance at a map of some kind. Your attention is drawn to the ongoing number of vehicles rolling on beside them, the dirt road acting as a metaphor for a conveyor belt as a continuous procession of troops are churned out and into their would-be doom as two human beings discuss the would-be whereabouts of a certain location. It captures the Vietnam War as a whole; a place in which a lot of fire power and lot of people kept getting rolled on into as those outranking them desperately tried to figure out what the Hell was going on and where the Hell everyone should be.People say the film is split into two 'parts', but it's not. It's actually one particular 'part', complete with characters and study that materialises into something else that just happens to be set elsewhere. Kubrick introduces his film; sets characters up and in true Hitchcockian style, kills off the one character that drives his opening third. But he is left wanting from there on in – with that one, distinct shot that kills a certain someone, I'm tempted to say that the film dies right there in that washroom along with said personnel. What is a pretty brutal, but I would think honestly portrayed, account of what it's like to become a United States Marine, shows various young, drafted Americans being trained to become killing machines for the world of war. But Kubrick is laying a rug under our feet and when the lead character decides it's journalism in which his beck-and-call lies, all this prior show and tell revolving around combat and 'what it's like to be a soldier' was really for not very much, as the lead branches out into another area of expertise. The rug is pulled away and people will say it's clever from Kubrick, I say it's cheating and just a little clumsy.Matthew Modine plays a certain Private Joker, 'Joker' being an alias he is given by his drill instructor Seargent Hartman (Ermey). The use of an alias and avoidance of use of Joker's real name attributes a certain ambiguity as to his identification, a renowned sense that everybody and anybody could 'represent' him as a character or as a real life person. The opening can be read into one of two ways; either you're going to find it a disturbing and very accurate look at the psychological effects of training for warfare or a series of 'fat' jokes that aren't particularly interesting. The fall guy is Leonard Lawrence (D'Onofrio), given the alias 'Private Pyle'. Pyle is the figure of ridicule throughout, with failings to accomplish the physical tasks the army demands consisting of the brunt of events in the opening hour. He is additionally a part of the film's one glaringly annoying scene during which the camera slowly zooms in on him pulling a would-be psychotic face as Hartman talks of Lee Harvey Oswald, himself an ex-marine, when he assassinated a certain person of a higher 'rank' than him. This foreshadows what is to come in regards to Pyle's own actions.The majority of what happens in Vietnam is just stuff strung together. Joker goes from one bombed out location to another; he meets someone he knew from his training; he gets into a daft egotistical confrontation with one of those big, bulky, clichéd soldiers who exist purely to maim the enemy and enjoy it (think Andy Serkis in Deathwatch). He'll engage in dialogue by some ancient ruins and pay sly reference as to how, deep down, all the people who survive Vietnam will miss it because a little piece of them will remain here given what an ordeal it really is – but it feels heartless and a little silly. Kubrick marks his finale with a lot of red tints and smatterings of loose flames here and there, burning up the scenery. It's an obvious visual representation of a decent into some sort of Hell as the final confrontation with a sniper is played out. But when people do get shot, Matthew Modine forgets to react and when other G.I.'s are downed by the Vietcong, there is no real reason to feel for them other than to remember that 'it really happened, thus I must feel bad for those that really suffered this fate'. The film is actually quite a soulless exercise and from what I have seen, is Kubrick's worst work.",6,1,3,9 May 2009
Empire of the Sun," Near immaculately put together wartime tale about a boy winding up on a front-line of poverty and hard times.
","Empire of the Sun is a gruelling child orientated character piece which taps into a child's fear of isolation as well as going all out in being a thoroughly engrossing war drama with a keen eye on depicting the horrors such an event. The film will begin and end with that of a container, of sorts, floating easily along a water way. They are, however, two very different containers carrying very different things and yet are intrinsically linked by the fact that what they possess are effectively deceased and gone. Where coffins housing the dead line a river during the opening few shots, a small suitcase in possession of the belongings held throughout by that of a certain character is seen gently floating off and away; the image signifying times having moved on, that the 'old' character is gone and a new, more-exposed-to-the-world in ways which would have never normally happened, is here.That character is Jamie Graham, played by Christian Bale; an infant initially living in the Chinese city of Shanghai just prior to Japan's attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbour and as a consequence, the majority of the Pacific's nations official entry into World War Two. He lives an affluent life with his rich parents, a blazer-clad boy singing harmoniously in a church when we first see him and later chauffeured back to a huge manor house in a neighbourhood firmly informing us of how he lives. What is more revealing, however, is the trawl home through the grime of some of the less desirable places native to the country; paupers and beggars, one of whom sits outside the property, sharing eye contact with Jamie in a reflective moment like they were from separate planets.Jamie loves his aeroplanes, and upon finding a downed fighter in a field during a function some miles away, clambers into it so as to enthusiastically act out war-games as if the pilot. Said notion is often found in war films which mistake acts of warfare as processions of action, and thus ought to be shot or constructed as exciting when the harsh reality of the subject is that they're anything but. Spielberg's film is more a project depicting someone taken from their bubbled existence and thrust into a limelight of real wartime poverty and survival thus forcing reflection. Events cause the film to progress into what is essentially a prisoner of war movie, but a prisoner of war film keeping clear of sugar coating such a situation and doing well to maintain a sense of causality mired down in the turgidness and ugliness of a wartime scenario moreover the bouncy, joyous one more inclined to rear up when escape is the sole purpose of the film's exercise.Once everything has happened away from where we are, and the Japanese have formally invaded this territory given their entry into the war, Jamie is separated from his parents in a street-set panic so returns to his home for a series of scenes shot as if the apocalypse has just happened or a nationwide epidemic has occurred forcing isolation and hiding. What is impressive is how the film goes about depicting Jamie's central transition, a film full of extended sequences and unbroken takes of young Jamie stumbling through a series of post invasion streets as he evades thieves his age and strives for aid in places he will not find it. In the background, things are blurred and the choice of angles at specific times are effective. Later on, things will appear to aesthetically 'normalise', as inceptions give way to a getting used to this newfound existence, it is through Americans Frank Demarest (Pantoliano) and John Malkovich's Basie; a seaman who lives out of a wrecked freighter in a harbour Jamie finds his feet.When one thinks back to Spielberg's oeuvre, specifically from that of the 1980s, Empire of the Sun is not the film which immediately comes to mind, and that is a shame - although not as much as the fact that the likes of 1984's Temple of Doom might very well do instead. It slots into a canon of around the time, let's say beginning in 1982 with E.T. and ending with Hook in 1991, depicting children or even children being exposed to a rawer situation than what was already evident in their lives â€“ when the movies Spielberg is churning out aren't made with a childlike enthusiasm, he seems to be able to get into the lives of minors and pull off the depicting of their plights; plights which carry that uneasy sense of both adventure and awe at their finding themselves in an unparallelled situation in a far off place, but fear of what is essentially the unknown. In Empire of the Sun, Spielberg veers off and away into a depiction of such things more inclined to being as good as his tale of a young boy coming into contact with an alien in E.T. than he does explore the freewheeling emotions of a young boy caught up in an adventure akin to Indiana Jones' in Temple of Doom, or indeed any of the child characters in the aforementioned Hook. It is a well played, meticulously unfolded piece clocking in at two hours but without a moment that either drags nor doesn't feels somewhat unsettling.",7,4,8,11 March 2012
Glory," Zwick's nigh on, indeed, 'glorious' exploration of the setting up of a certain military company during The American Civil War often makes for involving viewing.
","Glory begins by plunging us into the forefront of the American Civil War; a crash landing which sees a rather brutal battle sequence thrust upon us from the off which sticks with us. It provides us with what we presume to be a lead character; lingers on the aftermath of war and what it does to people physically, not shying away from anything, before plunging us again headlong into a separate battle unfolding within the realms of The Civil War; this one more related to people and a specific cause of fighting than the warfare itself. Edward Zwick's film is an affectionate retelling of a company of men, under white leadership, consisting entirely of black soldiers fighting for the Union Army in said conflict; an exploration amongst many things of identity further still within the company, and a respectful retelling of the true story of how ethical equality became apparent as whites and blacks fought together and died together on a level plain.Zwick casts, bravely given the time and the sorts of roles the actor was usually better known for, Matthew Broderick as the Union Army colonel named Robert Shaw; a sense of perspective, although deceptively so, established to revolve around this man as he leads his army's charge into battle against the Confederate Army – passing out in the process after garnering an injury and then having a confrontative sequence in a medical tent of another man's leg amputation shot from his point of view. The casting ends up being better than it has any right to be, an important scene seeing Broderick required to intimidate a recruit into reloading his rifle and firing it quicker than he's already doing so by way of firing off his own pistol a mere arm's length from the man's ear. The sense of Shaw being of this authoritarian ilk whom demands the best results possible, and is unashamed of getting them through whatever means, is evident here; if the casting of Broderick didn't work then this specific sequence would not have worked. Shaw is our anchor; his voice-overs updating us with precisely how he feels complete with angelic diary entries offering a definitive viewpoint from a higher-up, but it is around these things which the true tale of a group of people, indeed a race of people, is unfolded in a really engaging manner.Shaw's task, he being amongst the top in Union Army leaders, is to take charge of a new company of black troops which is being established following grossly affecting decisions by the higher-ups of the American government. It's through this later on that we come to realise there is no lead, merely a dramatic and informative retelling of how The Civil War affected race relations and had an impact on a nation's attitudes towards such a thing. The wider acceptance of this new division and the tasking of getting these new recruits into shape so as to be led into battle forms the greater extent of the picture, something Zwick executes with enough punch to save it from being some kind of equal rights lecture or melodramatic tale of being 'as-one'. But the trek is tough, and fraught with issues and difficulties; early on, the wider opinion of where it would seem many-a Union personnel stand on the issue of a Company of black soldiers arrives in the form of a racist trooper coming to the conclusion that 'it's better to go to war with a hog than a Negro' for the reason that 'at least you can eat the hog'.What follows is a tough, gritty and thoroughly engaging march through the military system for the characters involved as one's worth is proved, climaxing in a charge into battle that sees everybody reading from the same page, regardless of colour, during which white soldiers and black soldiers surge into battle together; as established the previous night: their emotions and fears the same. For the first time in history, we feel, a sense of togetherness or being at one with one another's respective race as they partake in the same action; attempting to attain the same goals; feeling the same feelings. The principal soldiers of whom we follow in this new regiment are a certain Trip (Washington); another man named Jupiter Sharts (Kennedy); an ageing gravedigger named Rawlins (Freeman) and a more informed, more educated man named Searles (Braugher) who was the first to volunteer but finds the early Army life the toughest amongst everyone else. Their struggles are in direct comparison to that of Shaw and his own disagreements with his second in command; the drill Sergeant, whom is seems abuses the new recruits based on their race more than anything as well as those of a far higher disposition within the military whom it seems lend themselves towards corruption.Zwick's attention to character is equally immersing, at once the soldiers just wanting to know when it is they are permitted to attain 'the blue of the uniform' before much later on having to question their own dedication to a cause that sees them pillage a village and partake in such gut-wrenching activity. The film's allowing of the black soldiers a voice or an identity in the uniform itself, before bringing things back so as to have them question this newfound state of identity bringing fresh, rich dynamics to what might have been a routine tale of how times changed during a famous war and attitudes merely shifted with them. In hindsight, and from what I've seen of Zwick's other work, his ability to tell a politically motivated story under a guise of half-decent adventure entertainment without being exploitative is evident in Africa's diamond trade and the threat of domesticised terrorism within the United States in 2006's Blood Diamond and 1998's The Siege respectively. Regardless of where you stand on those two, Glory somewhat impressively marking the beginnings of this ability he has to tackle such ideas in an engaging and accessible manner.",7,0,1,29 November 2010
Rocky II," Steady, if rocky in its trajectory; this first sequel just about holds its own without necessarily delivering that knockout blow the first one did.
","We arrive at the first Rocky sequel recalling that the 1976 serial Oscar winning, and quite magical, first Rocky film was first and foremost a gritty; street-set drama about two people falling in love. The charm of it was observing a hulking and somewhat brutish, although measured, man whom exuded confidence but found it difficult to find the right words falling in with an equally young women whose eloquence happened to be one of her qualities, but whose shy characteristic made it difficult for her to truly connect with other people. Mingling around in the background was this boxing match, and an egotistical champion in the sport challenging a wild-card to a bout to prove he could, in a literal sense, just about beat anybody. It was the sports movie which wasn't actually a sports movie; a film finishing with a 'big sporting showdown' in which the only real victory was the two leads figuring out that they'd quite like to spend a lot more of their time with one another.Rocky II kicks off with the final round of that fight, the titular Rocky's duel with an African-American heavyweight to whom he looses by the narrowest of margins. There is an unhinged inferring that that's what 1976's Rocky was all about; a fitting sentiment to begin proceedings when we observe this sequel is mostly all about the fight and the sports which formulates therein between the two, when allowing it to just blur into a more interesting tale, as was in the first film, is all the more engaging. That said, and by the time this first sequel is in full swing, one would have to be rather grizzled; rather sniffy to truly detest Rocky II - like the protagonist at the core of this edition, it is a tough film to love but an easy film to just slot into and generally root for.When we begin, it is in the aftermath of the monstrous encounter between the proverbial underdog and the established champ: Stallone's Rocky Balboa and Carl Weathers' Creed, fittingly named Apollo as he seemingly reigns down over all around him and within his field. They are treated for the previous night's injuries, and stay in a situation of hospitalisation in the same institute. Around them lie a flurry of fans and press personnel, Rocky's newfound fame seeing an array of autograph hunters desiring interactions with the guy and his name on a piece of paper. Rocky states there and then that he's retired from the sport, a knock-on affect which results in his brother-in-law, manager and close friend Paulie (Young) to veer away and back to the illegal way of life that plagued Rocky's prior existence. It is additionally a decision that, once out of the hospital, sees Rocky revert to what his previous status was before this overnight thrusting into stardom; that is to say, to remain steady with sweetheart Adrian (Shire) and garnering whatever work he can to pay for the expensive gifts and great deal of love he wishes to lavish upon her.In spite of his victory, Creed happens to want a rematch for reasons that are later revealed to be much more personnel to him this time round than the initial entry's blind egotism, and we feel a little more for him here. Rocky goes on to engage Adrian; an instance instigated during a surreal happening at an open-plan zoo under six inches of snow, in which the lone wildlife occupant of the place appears to be a tiger prowling around in his den. As Rocky and Adrian turn to leave, marriage proposal successfully in-tow, we observe the tiger emblem on the back of Rocky's jacket and sync it up with how out of place the zoo's tiger appeared; the sentiment inferring Rocky as a man having turned his back on the boxing world to do labour work, whilst keeping himself out of the limelight, is prominent and he appears under this guise as out of sorts with the nature of this existence, just as the tiger in the snow appeared to.We realise before Rocky that his spending ways cannot be supplemented by his meat stacking profession, nor his temperamental nature of trying to shoot TV adverts with equally temperamental directors. He realises coming back out of retirement is the only option, and we are weary of such a decision; weary of Creed's own apparent dedication to right-wrongs; weary of what Rocky has on the line to loose, specifically his sight in one eye and his family of Adrian as well as a newborn son whom arrives as the pressure cooker intensifies. We are weary of Rocky's own dedication, and whether he is genuinely transferring back to a life as a boxer once more out of fondness for the sport or if it is for a cash injection; made weary by his trainer Mickey's (Meredith) deduction, and it's a deduction we trust, that Creed will near-enough kill him if they were to fight again. It is a moment captured quite wonderfully by Stallone's positioning of his character in a doorway, as his trainer stands just outside and his wife on the stairs fearing for his health: the mind has been made up, and Rocky proceeds through the portal and back into his old world away from what's homely and safe. The film is not without merit; its final duel is constructed edifyingly, but its training montages are shot with too much intensity given the material, and the whole thing is too self-aware of its own core dramatics when a fourth-wall breaking telecast greets us ringside upon entry to the stadium – we are here, in this sequel, to see the fight and only the fight. Regardless, we're behind the characters enough to want them to succeed; Rocky himself states at one point that he'd be nothing and nowhere without the lovely Adrian – we'd be at a loss in backing him if he weren't.",6,0,2,13 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not enough of a Clone of what came before for us to hate it, but still lacking a certain something.
","The Star Wars series sputters and stutters into a second prequel here, in the form of 'Attack of the Clones'; an entry which probably improves slightly on the opening episode, but still seems to fall short, often on the basics, for it to feel like it is a proper piece of mythical story-telling.Indeed, after having appeared to alienate audiences with a saggy narrative involving both diplomatic disagreements and political strife in 1999's 'The Phantom Menace', Lucas is back and daring to re-tread relatively similar ground in his telling of a detective story about why a group of aliens might want to break away from a thousand year old galactic union to form a rival power-block. Told parallel is a more grounded love story between a bourgeoning male autocrat and the queen of a tropical planet which, because it involves that whom we know will become Darth Vader, is probably slightly more interesting, although is not powerful enough to carry the film alone.Suffice to say, Lucas doesn't quite hit either strand out of the park; you wait, patiently, for the spark, urging them both on to get there, but neither quite make it. By the end, the characters feel too much like action heroes, and do not feel like flawed people with problems and emotions.Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are back, ten years after the events of Episode One, and have been brought in by the Jedi council to protect the returning Queen of Naboo, Amidala (Natalie Portman), who is in a metropolis to help prevent the break-up of the Republic - something being brought about by the aforementioned alien solar systems who are leaving en masse. We're told that voting 'to form an army' is the solution to this.The film opens with the assassination of somebody close to Amidala and omnipresent in the first episode - an attempt at distancing the film from 'Phantom Menace', perhaps? The Queen suspects somebody called Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), but the rest of the characters dismiss this, so seeding doubt in the minds of the audience. Remarkably for this kind of story, the actual villain does not appear until the final act. Following a second assassination attempt, whereby a hitman oddly hires a hitman amidst the clever backdrop of neon signs that invoke iconography of the sleazy and shady, it is seemingly accepted that Amidala leaving her home was a mistake and she is carted back with Anakin, despite nobody actually thinking he is up to the job. Kenobi, meanwhile, hunts for the origin of these assassination attempts.Refreshingly, the film does not come to a grinding halt like the last episode once everybody decamped to Tatooine. Kenobi's strand, in the spirit of the more popular Star Wars entries, keeps moving and encompasses a series of action scenes, one of which is a neat hand-to-hand combat sequence in a terrific rainstorm upon a flight platform with smoothed-out edges going all the way down to a watery grave. One other sequence in this strand involves a spaceship chase which heads into an asteroid belt, something C3PO stated in 'V' was practically suicide, but hey-ho. Surely when you chuck a tracking device onto another spaceship, that means you don't have to fly so close to it... I suppose it's good for an action scene when you do, though...Unfortunately, none of it really amounts to anything particularly immersive. I think the conflict was supposed to radiate out of this strand, but there really isn't any - when we finally meet the villain, his ideas actually sound like common-sense: what if there IS a force of great evil, undetected, destroying the Union from within? What if this incognito clone army IS needed to fight off the true enemy? There is a terrible moment when Kenobi, unbeknownst to the bad-guys, overhears precisely what he needs to hear in the form of a plot, purely for the benefit of the film's progression, as the villains congregate to discuss details they would all have already known by now. The scene is needed for the benefit of the audience because it wasn't set up properly in the first act.The other half, as stated, is a little more substantial. Where Kenobi's strand is full of special effects and green-screen technology, and is telling a cold, hard story of investigation, the segments involving Portman and Christensen's characters' love story is about emotions; blooming feelings and unfolds amidst the beautiful true-to-life backdrops of Italy. While this contrast works better than it has any right to, the tale itself just doesn't quite blow us away; Amidala's behaviour is inconsistent, maintaining that, as a senator, she cannot get involved with a Jedi one minute, but is seemingly happy to strip to some leather nightwear in a warmly lit bedroom scene with him the next.Meanwhile, whilst their political views seem to clash in a later scene in a meadow, her response to Anakin's newfound love of the violence which came with an act of revenge seems to sit quite easily with her. While the dialogue is generally pretty bad ('A poisonous dart!'), one decent aspect of this strand is the emphasis on how Anakin feels for Amidala through what he says: the feelings of sickness and the missing her, etc.Alas, and already worn down by a coliseum battle, a worthy-enough climax in itself, the film creeps towards a final fight which, despite its impressive choreography, isn't actually about anything other than said choreography. I think the difference between these prequels and the original trilogy is the fact the first three unfolded during a time of war, so were quite easily afforded a sense of conflict: Empire v Rebels might be simplistic, but it is effective. Here, the conflict is either interior, which means working damn hard to bring about something of some substance, or is with characters (trade organisations; faceless Counts, etc.) which are just not very threatening. 'Clones' works in places, but too often feels like not very much.",6,1,1,19 July 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A 21st Century 80s buddy movie that prequels a 70s sci-fi franchise - Not Good.
","I'll admit it. I was impressed with Episode I of the Star Wars prequels even if it was my first foray into the whole thing. With Episode II, I have been put off seeing the remaining four films as it was, in truth, a complete waste of my time: The acting was bad, the plot tiresome, the delivery of the script awful, the themes unspectacular and the CGI being used as a bit of a cop out once everything bad had been established; even the annoying clicking noises the aliens used to communicate with were a disaster.Everything in the opening thirty minutes of this film is utterly forgettable. The two leads swan around some sort of space age city that amerces the screen in so much CGI, it's ridiculous. There's one point where a character sits in a café of some kind talking to an alien creature and despite there being a whole world of activity going on out of the window right next to him, he decides to keep his focus dead ahead of him; at the creature. There's not even a glance, just dead ahead. I mean, come on - what the alien had to say wasn't THAT interesting. This is an example of the CGI merely swallowing up the film. The other instance of frustration occurs during a car chase of some sort. The two characters strut around like they're in an 80s buddy/cop movie; exchanging bad dialogue and defeating the impossible to achieve their goals.'The force' was once a cinematic convention to savour and remember  now it's just a cheap plot device to win the audience over with. If these enemies are so smart, they should know not to mess about with Jedis in the first place, but alas, from certain failure comes undisputed success. An example can be when Anakin jumps from the 'car' through several lanes of flying traffic only to land perfectly on the target's car. Upon breaking his lightsaber, he has the cheek to comment in a disgustingly cheesy manner 'Oh no, Obi-Wan's going to kill me(!)' You really have to laugh; but laugh at it, not with it.When it comes to the characters/acting department, I'm thinking this is extremely important for a Star Wars film: lots of different types of alien/creatures/human beings that need certain unique traits to zone you into their world. Alas, again  not here. Portman delivers another shocking rendition of Queen Padme, Hayden Christensen reads his lines like they're off an autocue and given the terrible, cheesy, one-liner filled script; it was never going to work from the start. Still, at least there's less Jar-Jar this time.Topped off with poor excuses that lead into action scenes, such as the attempted executions that you just know everyone's going to escape unscathed from (The badguys should have learned by now, remember?) and then massive battle scenes that fly past in a blur that an X-wing fighter plane would be proud of, all the time relying on CGI and characters shouting their lines as you watch on without a care in the world. Star Wars: Episode II had all the makings of dangerously damaging the legacy that, apparently, Lucas managed to save with Episode III.",6,0,1,20 March 2007

"Monsters, Inc."," Monster laughs and nothing but praise for this Disney-Pixar effort.
","Without giving the name of the author, Canadian social commentator Mark Steyn cited a piece of writing during a 2012 interview with an American cable-TV company which was about how children perceive the world around them through the fiction they're exposed to early on in life. Principally, he cites an analysis made by a fellow-Canadian on how creatures, or 'monsters', on television, or in cutesy books, were damaging to kids - it imparted the idea that monsters were just cute, cuddly friends that needed taming or befriending. Steyn seemed to prefer 'classic' children's literature in this respect, because there you garner a '...far greater sense of the realities of life from the Brothers Grimm than you will from the Cookie Monster.'I wonder what either of them thought of 'Monsters Inc.', where the one infant character in the film is completely unafraid of precisely the sorts of post-Sesame Street monsters the article cited, yet is a character in a piece imparting the idea that cute and cuddly is good. To some extent, Disney's 2002 animation plays like a kind of animated therapy for young children, who will of course love the colour; vibrancy and sense of adventure infused throughout 'Monster's Inc.', but will also have one of their fears exorcised - that of the dark bedroom at night-time and the idea a creature might lurk beyond a visible realm.At the core of the film is a quite brilliant idea: in an alternate world running parallel to our own, there exist actual creatures, hideous in physicality, desperately in need of the terrified screams of young children so as to run their civilisation. In order to do so, they appear in bedroom closets around the world late at night (the only gateway from our own universe to theirs); do what they have to do to induce sheer panic and return home again having captured the noise in a canister. One of the film's best jokes, in fact, doubles up as a devilish social commentary on how much harder it is these days to truly frighten children, given what they are often exposed to on TV and in video games.The scream-drive is propelled by two monsters called Sully and Randall, whose physical characteristics are cleverly echoed by their voice-talents: Sully, like John Goodman, is big and huggable and has a dopey voice, whilst Steve Buscemi's lizard-like creation is more slender and bug-eyed. Sully is the consummate professional who goes through the same process every morning: exercising and scare routines with his flat-mate and floor-work partner Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). He blindly trusts the corporation, epitomised quite cleverly in the arachnid-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), who sports a waist-coat but is tragically missing a monocle. Children are Sully's worst enemy, believing them to be potentially toxic. Regardless, he puts his life on the line every day for his society - the moral justification for all this lies in the company's motto: 'We scare, because we care'.As each of the monsters in the company lumbered with this responsibility walk to their posts in slow motion, the film invokes Michael Bay's 1998 film 'Armageddon', which infers a sense of doom or catastrophe if these brave souls were to fail in their duty: these people are the guardians of civilisation. Civilisation does not quite crumble, but disaster strikes when a young American child manages to make its way out of our world and into the monsters' own - enough to have Sully and Mike worried their days are numbered as previous misnomers have led to other monsters banished to our world, cleverly accounting for Bigfoot and the Yeti. In a panic, the twosome concoct a plan to return it to where it belongs, but that becomes problematic when Sully becomes attached to it.'Monsters Inc.' cracks along at a fantastic pace and works so wonderfully well because of a number of things. Principally, the stakes are incredibly high, so there is always this rapid, even nervous, energy pulsating through the film once the 20 minute mark elapses, and the film does such a wonderful job in bringing the two personalities in the form of its heroes to life in such a short space of time that we are hooked on their adventure the whole way. Furthermore, the characterisation is superb - these are rounded characters with lives; dreams; goals and even girlfriends - they possess different attitudes; physical appearances and characteristics. The world it creates, that of one parallel to our own, is extraordinary from a design perspective - the way they echo one another in the form of a daily commute; workplace rivalry; a relaxing meal after work and generally the things you see out and about is marvellous.What directors Pete Docter; David Silverman and Lee Unkrich later pull off is the incredibly tricky transition the film needs to make from being a double-act comedy about getting rid of something which doesn't want to leave, to being a film about foiling a corporate conspiracy. One cannot laud the team enough. Laudable too is the character study - this is Sully's film; a character who blindly trusts the machine at the beginning of the film but undergoes his own journey to find out that kids are not toxic; corruption might come from anywhere and even tackles the moral dilemma of how to power his world. Irrespective of age, and with whomever you see it, 'Monster's Inc.' is a genuinely infectious and wholesome piece of animated entertainment.",7,0,0,30 April 2019
Bridget Jones's Diary," Pleasing and effective comedy about the ups and downs of seeking love.
","They say that if a man is not a socialist by the time he is twenty, then he has no heart, and that if he is not a conservative by the time he is forty, then he has no brain. So far as I can tell, 'Bridget Jones' Diary' depicts not a man but a woman who falls somewhere in-between both these two particular ages and, as a bonus, these two somewhat rudimentary world outlooks. While not a particularly political film, it is interesting to note how it seems to push the message that men and women are better together, and that individualism and empowerment is all well and good, but will ultimately lead to loneliness.Texas-born actress Renée Zellweger plays the eponymous Bridget Jones, a desk-jockey in a plush London office belonging to a publishing firm. She is single; 32 years of age and desperate for a man in her life as yet another New Year's ticks by- bellowing out the lyrics to 'All by Myself' after a day's slog, complete with all the drum and cymbal actions right on cue, to emphasise the point. Despite this, Jones is not lonely in the technical sense - she has a large group of contacts and acquaintances: her friends are an assortment of homosexuals and liberal metropolitans; her parents, played by Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones, eventually become separate shoulders to cry on, while at the office, there is her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), to whom she takes a fancy.The film makes some effort to point out as to how Jones has been living life fairly liberally: she smokes; falls drunk out of taxi cabs after nights out; has neglected her diet over the years and has placed a lot of effort and energy into her career in order to be where she is - there are not many people in jobs, after all, who might be able to rub shoulders with both Salman Rushdie AND Jeffery Archer at a function. Much later on in the film, there is a scene involving Jones having to do some actual cooking from original ingredients - the likes of which comes as totally alien to her, inferring a complete lack of skill in this department. This is something which would not have been the case for her previous generation, the likes of whom kept the homestead.The film depicts Jones seemingly want to break from most of this, and has her set about tidying up her life through a manner of ways which predominantly revolve around shedding her liberal skin - depicting the events amusingly in the titular diary, with her optimum goal being the obtaining of a man. Working with books for all her life, she is therefore afforded a degree of comedic prose with which to construct her entries. There are two men in her life who have the greatest potential of filling her life's largest chasm: one of them, and despite having already identified him as being somebody who embodies all that's wrong with men, is Cleaver. The other is a barrister and an old family friend played by Colin Firth called Mark Darcy, whose good looks the film feels need confirming to us early on by two women during a private conversation and whose paddling pool Jones happened to play around naked in when they were eight. Playfully, the film affords Cleaver and Darcy an antagonistic history in that one once slept with the other's fiancé. I was struck by just how passionate the film feels about its central message, that of how men and women are happier together and that love, it would seem, conquers all. At the time of the film being made, female employment actually outnumbered male employment in the United Kingdom for the first time in history. Feminism had found a happy place in society, allowing women to possess their own freedoms and careers - free from feeling ashamed about their bodies and allowing them to have relationships with co-workers on top of whatever else.
 
I'm not sure the film is necessarily taking a stand against much of this, and in its heroine, it has somebody who embodies these philosophies better than most, but it treads dangerously close to a line the other side of which commends monogamy; married life and things like pride in appearance: items which you might say are/were anathema to many of those who helped Labour to their landslide win at around the exact same time the source material for this film was conceived.Certainly, by the end, the film has depicted more than just Bridget Jones turning her life around: Jones' mother, in actual fact, goes in the opposite direction - describing herself as living in the 'winter' of her life and admitting that, if she'd had a second chance, would not have even bothered with having children. Being more liberal in old age, she leaves her husband for another man. There is even room for an otherwise irrelevant narrative about a Kurdish man who escapes illegal deportation and thanks the heavens he has had a wife by his side all this time. The manner about which these supporting strands eventually unfold only seem to serve to reinforce my belief that the film is about how human beings do better as twosomes. Aside all things, the film is often just terrifically funny: moments such as the montage of job interviews Jones undergoes cannot help but make you laugh, whereas her desperate attempt to provide a speech at a book launch with the equipment not fully functional works on more than just the singular level. From the point of view of straight up genre film-making, the film ticks enough boxes. 'Bridget Jones' Diary' has spawned two sequels, neither of which I have seen, but will certainly hunt down - I would recommend this particular entry besides.",6,0,0,22 July 2018
Incendies," If its title translates out of French and into English as 'Scorched', then this is a near red-hot drama making the difficulties of taking this subject matter on look easy.
","The opening scenes of Incendies paints an image of a cantankerous elderly women whom, even in death, is forcing her children to run around on goose chases after a series of eccentric entries to a will that does nothing but pose further questions and cause further action when closure and other such things are all that's desired at such a difficult time. We feel sorry for the kids, a Canada residing brother and an elder sister; we feel a little bitter towards their recently deceased mother and then we witness a duel pilgrimage across the Eurasian border so startling that words such as 'humbling' don't really do it the sorts of justice it requires.The family to whom all this bother is unfolding are the Marwan's: siblings Jeanne (Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Gaudette), here in the present day, and then that of Lubna Azabal's Nawal, way back when. Needless to say, I'd rather have the modern-day set bother and the strife of the siblings than that of Nawal's. Jeanne and Simon sit silently in a solicitor's office, an odd air of grief and frustration abound as these requests documented by Nawal are read; requests more broadly encompassing the apparent need for the two to journey great distances and find a specific someone which will reveal all. Jeanne is the one who takes the plunge and ventures away from the niceties of her first world, economically developed living quarters to that of where Asia meets Europe. In the solicitor's office, Jeanne chirps up ahead of Simon when asked if there are any problems or inconveniences with what is being presented to them – yes, there is and the labelling of this person as being the sort to initially put the foot forward is established when Simon only begins to enquire once the green light has been instigated.A maths teacher, so good with problem solving and equations which are seemingly impenetrable, Jeanne heads out to a place which is ambiguous in its actual identity and that people appear to entrust is more broadly representative of Lebanon, in spite of the fact a Palestinian flag is very briefly identifiable in the corner of the frame at on one fleeting instance. Her journeys take her there so as to look for what the will says is a long-lost father as well as another brother whom neither she nor Simon ever knew of. Unfolded in crisp tandem is the tale of their mother some thirty-odd years ago, and Nawal's own hardships born out of persistent rejection from peers; religious circles and family members. It leads her to exploring this free-spirited characteristic embedded within by herself, and on a very dangerous line throughout, as she attempts to look for a son born out of wedlock and to a certain individual of a certain ilk many of whom within Nawal's initial circles take issue.The parallel between either journey mother and daughter undertake, similar in structure and scale, is fairly clear; the quest taking either woman all around the houses, from bombed out orphanages to grotty prisons. There is one sequence, a sort of grotesque centrepiece in its content but quietly beautiful in its harsh and thoroughly professional depiction, which is absolutely terrifying: a sequence which depicts a bus full of Muslims being ambushed by that of a Christian group of militants during this, a Civil War which has broken out in the undetermined nation. It is a sequence remarkable for its stark nature anyway, but additionally because it isn't necessarily the emotional crux of the film. The scene is made more impacting given the happenings within recent years of the film's production in nations such as Pakistan and Angola, and attacks relayed onto that of sporting personnel whose tales have graced news reports when their buses have come under fire and lives have been lost. Additionally, the sorts of brutality aimed at those within does well to subvert the idea of anonymous Muslim aggressors, of whom are shrouded in mystery and come complete with towels around their faces, attacking innocents and children by reversing the religious backgrounds as well as the respective roles of victimised and perpetrator. Here, Christian soldiers go on a rampage thus destroying a small, and often easily demonised, Muslim congregation. Regardless of that individual sequence's affecting qualities, Denis Villeneuve's film is a real sucker punch of emotion and biting self-discovery which, at certain stages, crept up on me; a really ambitious and worthwhile piece.",7,0,4,9 February 2012
The Godfather: Part II," Two split, and very compelling, stories of men going through their own emotional grinders told amidst a backdrop of honor, family ties and trust.
","The second Godfather film kicks off in a similar fashion to the first; with a large and overwhelming gathering of friends and family on a sunny day within the confines of the Corleone family grounds. The event is the Holy Communion for Michael Corleone's (Pacino) son, and much like the wedding with which the first film began, it represents the beginning of a new venture; of a new tale, or of a new chapter in life or in the franchise that is the Godfather films, a new addition to the lives of this collection of Mafia based individuals whom are forever being deconstructed on screen. And what a tale the piece eventually branches out into, giving us the next chapter in the lives of those in the 'present' tense, as well as seamlessly incorporating an interesting mesh of the rising of one gangster twinned with his lust for revenge.This second strand is, of course, the tale of Vito Corleone (De Niro); an Italian immigrant of the Andolini family based on Scicily and his coming of age in early 20th Century New York. The Godfather Part II is an extremely assured film; a film that is mostly everything a crime film can be, complete with a patient and mature aesthetic which helps in the distinct placing of it in the annuals of contemporary American cinema. The film is split into two equilibriums, one occurring from the late 1950's onwards while predominantly focusing on Michael and his family and friends, where as the other initially unfolds in the very early years of the 20th Century before branching out into the 1920s. This segment sees Vito marry; get involved in petty crime; come up against a local crime kingpin as well as have a son but always retain an eye on a certain larger goal which awaits him back in Scicily.Each of the two equilibriums offer very different studies of the human condition. The equilibrium in the 'present' tense takes on a certain amount of substance to do with honour and trust; as well as incorporating the notion of expansion and moving on, which ties in with the idea of modernity and branching out in an attempt to keep up with the times. These are ideas Michael brings up in the first Godfather film, mainly through fear of his family's safety that they need to 'go straight' but additionally because he feels real estate and so forth acts as a healthy means, money-wise, to sustain the family for the years to come. The other equilibrium sees a much more simplistic and routine chain of events; a tale of revenge and a certain degree of ruthlessness brought about within one man as this study of this character evolves him from an innocent and frightened child; to a young man who is very much observant of this new world he's in; to cold-blooded killer.The installation of Vito's story here is simplistic but very well done in both a story telling and character driven sense. Vito becomes aware of the notion of crime in New York and learns of the rules of hierarchy. He observes his initial, more local, nemeses in Don Fanucci (Moschin) in a close to voyeuristic manner; not necessarily gazing at the individual but at what the individual is: feared but additionally respected. Vito is not afraid of Fanucci, but the study of Vito's involvement in crime, which begins with the stealing of someone's rug and the temporary holding of a neighbour's illegal firearms, act as lures into a world within the historically proclaimed 'new world' he has already arrived in. You might view Vito's tale as a tragedy, since it is Vito's entry into this line of work that will propel him into the mindset of a criminal and, ultimately, it is this line of work that develops the attribute of a cold blooded killer which enables him to fulfil his goal of revenge.The passage of film looking at Vito sees the film revisit one of Vito's ideation from the first edition; the notion of always killing for business and that there is nothing personal behind 'hits' - it is strictly business. Vito and his goal as a young man in New York exist before these rules are drawn up; Vito's hatred of Don Ciccio for the death of his father during the prologue is not business, but very much personal. It might be this that makes Vito's strand of The Godfather Part II the better of the two, and it may well be the reason people have more of a reaction to this edition of the trilogy; in the sense it is a piece establishing ideals and ideation's; before having, what is arguably its strongest character, confront what we already know he believes in and threaten its integrity.Michael's segment of the film covers broader, more personal issues such as life and family ties and marital relationships. It is about expanding an empire on the outside just as much as it is the narrowing down of an empire on the inside: finding out who is actually who and where they stand. There is one such brilliant scene in which Michael and Fredo (Cazale) confront one another and they fall out of favour. It is an establishing of power as Michael, standing, towers over Fredo who up to this point has become more and more of a loose cannon. Michael's segment of The Godfather Part II isn't so much about the mafia or crime as much as it is the human condition; it uses said setting as a means to explore these conditions within a criminal world, as death and increased pressure to make moves dominate person's lives. Its dedicated and calm approach to psychologically chaotic and unnerving subject matter allows the film to retain a certain juxtaposed sense of dread throughout. Perhaps undoubtedly, The Godfather Part II will remain a somewhat timeless study of emotion, angst and so much more.",8,0,2,28 June 2009
The Bourne Ultimatum," This is what happens when you blow $110,000,000 on a game of 'hide and seek'.
","A strong entry into the series? This is about as strong-a entry into a series of films as a Halloween sequel is. It seems that director Paul Greengrass has attempted to combine art with entertainment and has come up with a right mess consisting of very few things and those few things in their own right are disappointing. On the surface, The Bourne Ultimatum is Matt Damon returning to the role of Jason Bourne; a man on a mission, a man betrayed by those he was once employed by and a man fighting tooth and claw everyday  running and hiding, trying to evade capture or death  and for what? Well, this addition to the trilogy throws in the old 're-discovering the roots' plot line towards the end after someone in the agency turns out they feel a little sorry for Jason, needless to say, that was a huge anticlimax as is 80% of the film.A lot may have been said about the camera work but I don't really have that much of a gripe with it; I acknowledge that people's attention spans when it comes to these sorts of films may wander uncontrollably but here, the shaking and the panning is enough to give even those with severe ADD the sense that they may have missed something and would like to go back to double check. But it is more than the camera that brings The Bourne Ultimatum down to the level of mediocre action film dross, it is the fact the entire film is a series of reaction shots; the idea that after having seen this film, stupid people will now be able to tell people they know a country called 'Morocco' exists or that in London there's a station called 'Waterloo'. But the biggest problem with the film is its story because it is a narrative that has been stretched across three films now and by the time the thirty minute mark has gone in this addition, it is a narrative that has worn thinner than an already size zero supermodel on a crash diet. OK, we know Bourne is on the run; we know these government people bark a lot at their colleagues, displaying copious amounts of ego and we know that towards the end, Bourne will get close enough to where he was created just so that we can witness him have an epiphany, with a little help from an insider who conveniently helps him.The trouble with the film is that there is no heart and there is no logic at times, either. Everything is done by the numbers with chase scenes that do not thrill; fight scenes that do not matter and character interaction down the line of a cell phone complete with stern faces and serious reactions. Onto reactions; this film loves its reaction shots. Every so often there is a reaction in the command centre from one of the many nameless and faceless suit wearing government officials that want to kill Bourne. Every so often, Bourne will look at his surroundings, maybe whilst talking to reporter Simon Ross (Considine) as everyone keeps moving; talking and following one another; it is: 'chase, stop, talk, reaction' repeated about fifty times.If people are to compare Bourne to Bond, the Bourne films must exercise some sort of clarity; some sort of interesting idea or narrative; some sort of mission for Jason to take part in  the first Bourne film worked because we knew as much as he did due to amnesia but along with that, there was a love interest; a hit-man out to stop Bourne and the off-screen threat of the government felt fresh, but here it is either too lacking or has gone stale. Locations are another important part of these sorts of films, especially if people will compare Bourne to Bond since here, there does not seem a reason for Bourne to travel except to keep on hiding. We are given crude establishing shots every time the action shifts to a new locale: Waterloo station; a Moroccan slum; Madrid. Each shot has a tacky sounding accompanying electronic soundtrack, moves slightly as it shows us these places and generally feels like its some sort of moving postcard. I think it's sad that an English director has to set his action at Waterloo, the busiest station in London but maybe the only one American's will recognise, likewise if the action is set in Spain  where else to go than the actual capital Madrid? It's never anywhere else, is it.There is a scene that sums up the brainless logic behind the entire film. The scene takes place in Morocco and a car has blown up, maybe injuring Bourne. Desh (Ansah) does not think to walk over and finish him but walks off: cut to the reaction shot and you guessed it; Bourne opens his eyes as the stirring music starts up, kicking him into action as he tracks down the guy and has a fight with him  that highlights both the logistical flaws and the re-occurring reaction shot problem. By the time Bourne has a chance to find out who he is, we are sick of the sight of him; if we've seen him jump off a building once and live to tell the tale, we don't need to see it one final time as his leg flinches and that music starts up again. The Bourne series is becoming an obligatory and inane passage of film, straining its story and dumbing down its thrills and logic  this is certainly a case of The 'Yawn' Ultimatum.",5,0,2,16 March 2008
Fargo," Still to be topped by the Coens, or really by anyone else for that matter.
","I still think Fargo is the Coen brothers' crown and glory, even after seeing some of their more popular films such as The Big Lebowski and Millers Crossing; not to mention recent best picture winner No Country for Old Men. Such a film can be revisited and enjoyed every now and then, delivering a powerful experience revolving around some pretty desperate characters in a location ice cold and seemingly cut off from the rest of the world.One of the many reasons I frequently revisit Fargo is its attention to detail and the manner in which it comes across as an art film. There is so much going on both on and below the surface in the film and yet it doesn't need to bash you over the head with vast visuals in order to tell you this. On the surface, Fargo is a very quaint and slow burning crime drama revolving around an organised kidnapping and a ransom deal that goes awry. The film is one of few that I suppose comes to near perfection, in most every aspect of film-making. The cinematography, the screenplay, the intensity of some characters and the quirkiness of others, the attention to each character as an individual different to everyone else and the tiny things like the attention to sound that compliments the visuals.I said the location was cold and felt cut off from the rest of the world. In essence, most of the characters are like this. They are self obsessed and do not stop to think about others until it is too late, the incidence that demonstrates this is when events instigator Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) sits in his house's hallway and contemplates how everything got to the level of awfulness it's now at in the film. Other characters are victims; others are phoney aggressors that mutate into real aggressors and others are innocents tragically caught up in the middle.The film is about pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand) as she attempts to piece together what happened following the shooting of a state trooper after he pulled over a car. This event is connected to the arranged kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Rudrüd) by her husband Jerry so that he can quench his thirst for greed and automatically inherit a lot of money from his super-rich father in law. The shooting of the trooper is a significant event; it sparks a change in both genre and focus, shifting the perspective from Jerry and his criminal buddies to Marge and her quest to just figure things out for herself. The film carries its crime related establishment over into a detective strand, but maintains enough of a focus on both to deliver a riveting and harrowing tale.The film begins with Jerry meeting both Carl Showalter (Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare) at a bar, again in the middle of nowhere. He lends them a car and gives them the heads up on the plan; he is also very late for his appointment which could be seen as a pre-cursor to the string of badly timed and miss-matched events that follow. It is one man's desperation and greed that signals the chaos and Jerry is that man. 'It was a mix up, I guess' says Jerry; one of many more to come.It's easy to just sit and watch in awe when viewing Fargo, even on a repeated viewing. The Coens pay specific attention to the crime genre but also to comedy, black comedy, best seen when Jean is in the process of being kidnapped and panics amidst the shower curtain before falling down the stairs and knocking herself out. Additionally, upon arriving at the log cabin, she panics some more and rushes around whilst bound and blind thus falling over a log and hurting herself again. It is the bizarre image of someone trapped in a shower curtain and running around in the snow with a sack on their head juxtaposed with the situation that is the kidnapping and the two kidnapper's reactions to these events.But additionally to this, the Coen brothers pay specific attention to realism. When at the night club bar, Carl tries to get the attention of a waiter who cannot hear him and walks off and it's these tiny, tiny focuses on the unnecessary that just push the film into a boundary of the brilliant, you're convinced these people may be real in real places doing real things. But to see the film is also to hear it. Witness the snow falling gently or the wind blowing minutely; the use of the television show playing as one kidnapper makes their way up the side of the house much to Jean's surprise and horror. It is the attention to sound as well as the visual that truly packs the punch which hits home with Fargo, a juxtaposition of sound and imagery as we feel the same emotions of surprise and fear etched on a character's face.I am pleased the Coen brothers have had the success they've recently been through as when they keep within in the realm of the crime or gangster genre, things usually go very well. Their branching off into comedy rarely works for me, but seems to give many others a kick so that's all well and good. But if they ever do match Fargo, and they have come close, then the spectacle will truly be one to witness.",10,0,1,7 January 2009
Predator," Spooky
","Round about the time, Predator was competing with Aliens for top 'Beast' film, and in my opinion, Sigorney Weaver loses out. The Way the predator picks off the marines, and the spooky bits where you saw the invisible image of predator as it cloaked. I was Itching to see what it really looked like, and I finally did after it was injured in a gunfight. Arnold Schwartzenegger (Terminator, Kindergarten cop, Batman and Robin) acts 'Dutch' well and his marine partners are not bad. Their originally called in to rescue a couple of hostages who are treated very badly in the beginning of the film as we see, But the platoon discover a sinister thing out there in the jungle and when they find another U.S marine team skinned alive in the tree's. A woman they find, only speaks native language, and after trying to escape them twice, she starts to think again after she bumps into one. Arnie was good in this film and I still can't get over the strangeness of when you see 'though the predators eyes' A definite 'must see'",7,0,1,30 June 2001
Léon: The Professional," Still one of the more quotable, entertaining, touching and flat out enjoyable films I've ever seen.
","Léon is pure film-making, outstanding just as it is hypnotic just as it is out and out entertaining. Known as The Professional to others, Luc Besson's debut English language film captures the essence of evil on screen just as it does the potential hope other individuals may carry amidst all the gloom and depression in one of cinema's favourite down and out cities: New York. Why Léon is such an unrecognised film is quite bewildering  IMDb has it grossing a modest $19 Million dollars but it won two awards and garnered a few other nominations. Everyone likes a hero and most people like a story where two people (usually of opposite genders) connect in certain times of hardship amidst a locale of no hope  at its core, Léon could be seen as exactly this.The film is a tale of revenge, a love story and a crime drama complete with hit men, criminals, bent police men and innocent young girls caught up in the middle. The film presents to us how one event or one act of greed can act as a catalyst for bigger and nastier things, on a much larger scale than first intended and the film also brings a certain humane quality to worn out clichés and typical characters for the genre; like Tarantino and the Coen brothers at the height of their quality as seen in Pulp Fiction and Fargo respectively, this is Luc Besson stripping down the screen and delivering on a simplistic but immensely satisfying level.The ingredients work in Léon. At its heart, a vulnerable hero in Mathilda (Portman) who is established to be living in a 'world' that is less than perfect but is a hero whose life is changed by an outside, unseen event and must then realise this as a trigger for not only her desire for revenge, but the propulsion into the real world in which she will learn the skills she needs and generally mature. The idea, or formula, is best presented in the training montage Léon (Reno) himself and Mathilda partake in to a popular Björk song  it is the classic case of passing time to a montage to signify maturity and learning.But this is in no way a criticism as much as it is recognising and appreciating effectiveness. Mathilda's goal is to avenge the death of not her family as such, but her little brother who she deemed was innocent at merely eight or so years old. By this rational, her mother and sister were also innocent but Mathilda just doesn't appreciate them as much to avenge their deaths. The film's principal study begins with its hero on the verge of suicide, as a scene over the phone with a correctional institute tells us: Mathilda mimics her mother and tells the woman on the phone that Mathilda's death is the reason she hasn't been attending school. It is the low point of Mathilda's life and occurs just prior to the point of no return in which corrupt DEA officers blow away the rest of the family. The point of no return is signified beautifully as Mathilda walks past the wreckage of her apartment, gazing in slow motion, and rings the bell on Léon's door  the door opens and light fills the screen as she is accepted.The film actually fills up a lot of its time prior to this with Léon himself, not necessarily tricking the audience as to who the film will be about, but informing us of the type of person that awaits Mathilda. Indeed, the opening scenes or indeed shots of the camera towering over Central Park and down a New York street presents to us the location of New York in all its grimy glory as we delve deep within the heart of the city, all the time the tracking shots getting closer to ground level and all the time getting nearer to its destination, a café run by a man named Tony (Aiello). The first we see of Léon are his round sunglasses, creating a physical barrier between us, the audience, and the identity of this man whom downs glasses of milk in no time and talks casually about killing people for money. But the following scenes of Léon happy, enjoying himself and getting on with ironing and watering plants breaks off from stereotypical hit-man personas and gives us a different light. This leads to Léon's first encounter with Mathilda during which he tells her life is 'always like this', this twinned with the fact we know she's potentially suicidal makes the audience uneasy. But, she seems jolly and happy when she goes to the store for Léon  she is out and about and doing something for someone else that she deems worthy of such attention, which will echo the understanding and the relationship they'll soon have. Incidentally, later on Tony's warning about change being 'a bad thing' and that Léon was in trouble before over a woman paints a potentially ominous picture.The villain of the piece is Norman Stansfield (Oldman) who is a very intimate and aggressive character and Oldman plays him in a way that suggests someone who could go from green to red or from calm to sociopathic in a matter of seconds. The fact he tells one of his men to tell the police that 'we were doing our job' hints that the sort of prior violent activity is not unfamiliar to Stansfield and co. further creating a dangerous opinion of the characters in our minds  they are not to be messed with. Léon is a tale of a young protagonist having to learn the hard way and still not really being up to scratch; it is a hybrid of crime, drama, romance and tragedy that spirals out of control but remains dramatic and heart wrenching all the same  Besson has made few English language films but there will always be Léon.",10,9,12,5 December 2008
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Really smart and somewhat humbling film that entertains and amuses.
","Made at a time when films on the Vietnam war were being produced by America at a healthy rate, Good Morning, Vietnam comes across as the sort that falls into both 'types' that were being produced at the time. Platoon got under the skin of Vietnam, telling the events from an individual's perspective through voiceovers without relying on a lot of causality, rather the everyday tasks and events that occur. Full Metal Jacket was an interesting beast in the sense most of its more intense scenes didn't actually happen in Vietnam but rather at home on the training ground. But both were in a sensible tradition and took attention away from the Reaganism inspired 'action' films that were Rambo: First Blood Part II and the like.Good Morning, Vietnam falls into both these sorts of Vietnam war films. On one hand it is a serious film about the war and deals with serious issues such as morale and how dangerous conflict with the enemy actually is without doing what Rambo did by turning the war genre into a sub-division of the action genre. At one point in the film, DJ and lead character of the film Adrian Cronauer (Williams) finds himself in a hostile area out in the jungle and you do feel the shift in atmosphere the film briefly moves into in the sense this guy is not a soldier but he is in a dangerous position and he isn't equipped with how to get through it. There is another scene in which a street side bomb goes off and Adrian is caught up in the middle of it, further reminding us of the war zone and cleverly shifting the aura.But the film does fall into the genre of comedy and while it does so, it never distracts us from the fact this is taking place during a war unlike First Blood: Part II which could really have been an action film set amongst any backdrop. Good Morning, Vietnam does not ignore its comedy roots either and gives us genuinely entertaining disc jockey rants from Williams who shines with his animation and ad-libbing, further reminding us of a later film of his, Aladdin, and how he really was the star of that piece.The best parts of Good Morning, Vietnam actually raise issues to do with oppositional reading. As a character, Adrian is one of those charismatic individuals who is perhaps more focused on entertaining his audience first but when repercussions to do with that want to entertain arise, it is an oppositional reading to something that seems innocent enough. There are a couple of scenes and incidences that deal with this theme of oppositional reading. One that springs to mind takes place in a bar in which Adrian has brought a Vietnamese friend whom he teaches in an English class. The trouble is, it's a G.I. bar and certain soldiers have an issue with the Vietnamese person being there. It is Adrian's carefree and relaxed attitude to letting the individual come with him to the bar that has upset certain others around him, resulting in an oppositional opinion on whether the Vietnamese person should be allowed there. One says he can, others say he can't and conflict erupts.This battle is constantly going on within the boundaries of the radio studio and exists between Adrian and the censors who blank out all the bad news such as deaths and bombings, failing to deliver the real news, and instead keep morale from going below a certain point. Adrian's style of giving the people what they should hear in a charismatic style also rubs off spawning a sub-story revolving around a small school that teaches Vietnamese people the English language. Before hand, they were learning very basic words and phrases but after Adrian takes over, New York City slang or 'jargon' is the name of the game and while you wouldn't find English as a foreign language classes doing this sort of thing, Adrian brings his charismatic style to a class, turning it from formal to informal.The theme here is that he's giving them exactly what he feels they need to know, not what the curriculum demand they know. It is the same with the radio station and the news censorship; giving people what they have a right to know vs. what a higher power say they should know. The principal foil for Adrian is Lt. Steven Hauk (Kirby) who is against Adrian's style of parody and constant joking but when he is put on air, the best he can do is adopt the voice and role of a Frenchman as he mocks and plods his way through airtime. It is a battle that the oppositional readers loose since morale falls drastically after Adrian is taken off and he is forced to be reinstated because of this.Good Morning, Vietnam carries a pumping soundtrack which is what you'd expect for a film about a DJ and an emphasis on radio and its constant referencing to popular culture, gliding from The Wizard of Oz to Eleanor Roosevelt makes Williams' scenes consistently fun to watch. But other than this, it gives some political stances without ever feeling forced with the 'Wonderful World' montage over wartime action and juxtaposes James Brown's music over other scenes of wartime action. The film is a success in comedy and drama, a rarity of sorts given Dr. Strangelove supposedly set the standards.",8,18,23,23 September 2008
American Pie," Routine situational-comedy, which seems to want to say something although isn't sure what or how to do it
","The cultural and sexual revolution is referred to as such because it revolutionised, aside from certain other things, attitudes towards culture and sex. Where it hit in the 1960's, among other places, was the United States of America and 'American Pie' is less-so a commentary on why we-are-what-we -are than it is a reasonably funny depiction of a group of people living their lives in such a fashion BECAUSE of what preceded them. If GK Chesterton once said that '...there is a certain fury in sex that we cannot afford to inflame, and that a certain mystery and awe must always surround it if we are to remain sane' then Paul & Chris Weitz's 1999 film should seem like a kind of antithesis to this. Indeed, I do wonder if the central characters in 'American Pie' even know of the origins of the world outlooks they each possess. One of them, Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), seems to cut more of an esoteric figure than the others, or perhaps that's just because the others know less of the world than it first seems. Despite his nature, however, not even Finch seems to know why there exists a sudden rush amongst a class of youngsters to lose their virginity before the termination of an American high school year. Writing in 'Unspeakable Things', British social commentator Laurie Penny describes sex as 'something you do' - not as something '...you wait around for someone to do TO you', before going on to describe her virginity as something she 'shook off' at the first opportunity she had – as if it was an annoying bout of influenza. 'American Pie' captures this whole ethos somewhat well – the notion that abstinence is virtuous, or that sex is something else other than mere recreation, rears up in drips and drabs but not enough to convince us it's what the makers actually think. 'American Pie' depicts a diverse set of boys: one speaks Latin and drinks expensive coffee. Another, Chris (Chris Klein), is a bulky lacrosse player. Kevin already has a girlfriend; is close to sex anyway and is granted, I think, the deliberate privilege in this regard of being the best looking of the five while Stifler (Seann William-Scott) treads an uneasy line between unfriendly lout and colleague you cannot afford not to have. The last, Jim (Jason Biggs), we sense is some kind of lead – his father was, we feel, present when much of the aforementioned cultural revolution unfolded and was amongst the first to break the taboos. His willingness for Jim to follow in his footsteps hits a strange spot between curiously heart rendering and absolutely deplorable. Depending on your politics, of course...Each of the boys is in their final year at your standard American high-school, but none of them have had sex yet except for Stifler, who seems to want to have it again, although is hindered by this fresh swarm of vultures now surrounding what was once his easy prey. They induce an agreement between them that they will press to lose their virginities before the year is up and a graduation prom takes place. How they go about doing this involves a diverse set of approaches and circumstances, neither really overwhelming the other and each different enough to entertain us reasonably well. One character eventually only finds what he is looking for when he gives up all hope and accidentally finds it right under his nose – a process of maturing enough not to especially fall into a trap of hedonism and rather to take things as they come. Chris only joins a soppy choir group to score one of the many women who sing in it, although is depicted as to actually coming to care for one of the girls there.Much of the gross out humour involving toilets and the consumption of bodily fluid is unwelcome, but then it always is in these films – writers never learn. Fortunately, these instances are rare and one can feel struck ultimately by how reigned in its material actually is. For instance, when the film finally bares a pair of breasts, we feel as if we should flinch because there has not been the cascade of nudity and 'raunch' we were perhaps expecting - the likes of which others in its genre have succumbed to. Does one really recommend 'American Pie'? Not especially: it is episodic and often quite disgusting, but it is not a film one can easily despise. Is it really a film which, hysterical conservative shrieking aside, really sends young men and women out to 'get laid' as soon as possible? It seems to present sex, or the pursuit of sex, as something frustrating; bumpy and ultimately superfluous to a good, hearty relationship with someone whose time you genuinely enjoy, but it seems nonplussed about people going out to get it anyway. The film is a long way from being a triumph of conservatism, but it does not seem to argue the case for the other side quite as manically as I remember it doing.",6,1,3,12 March 2017
Burn After Reading," An odd venturing into territory of both the political and pastiche sort, as the Coen's just about tread water with a purposely dopey spy thriller-come-romance feature.
","It seems somewhat strange that George Clooney and Tilda Swinton would be in Michael Clayton, one of 2007's better films: a thriller about corruption; guilt; paranoia; espionage and so forth about a year or two prior to the pair of them then staring together in this; a pastiche of most of those things from the usually frustratingly wavy pens of the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan. The Coen's do indeed deliver a strange spoof-come-pastiche, delivered by way of their off beat and scatty humour ranging from dark and dreary in brutally efficient deaths inflicted on some by others to the construction one character lends towards a contraption designed to give its user the full benefit of a sex toy with minimal effort. Burn After Reading calls to mind a number of films of old, mostly of the spy or espionage ilk; broadly speaking, the film is a little like that 1998 John Frankenheimer film entitled Ronin only with Stellan Skarsgård's character completely removed and somebody like Jim Carrey's character from Dumb and Dumber inserted in place of him; an idiot that just happens to hold all the aces, much to the frustration of some of the other more brutal, more professional individuals entwined. Even Clooney's character himself has a name that echoes Michael Caine's Harry Palmer, but really only if you say it relatively quickly and repetitively.The film over-complicates a relatively routine premise, but deliberately so. Brad Pitt's Chad Feldheimer and Frances McDormand's Linda Litzke work at a local gym in the Washington DC area. He's eccentric in his body movements and gestures, the sort that strolls on ahead with an idea because it initially seems like an hilarious thing to do without much thinking about what the consequences might be; she's a lonely woman desperately seeking companionship via an online dating website, with a number of expansive operations on her body and facial area the overall goal so as to completely reinvigorate herself. Their roles as gym supervisors signals a sense that they're based within a zone in which people are present so as to tone up or to change appearance, dramatically or otherwise. Linda and Chad will undergo a similar 'toning up' process as they ill-advisedly leave their common existence behind and enter the world of espionage as gym owner Ted (Jenkins) persistently tells Linda she looks fine in a physically sense, and that the changes she has planned are unnecessary. Whilst on the surface a mere comment about her plastic surgery, it works on another level as a warning of greater items of change; particularly, her dipping into this new world she is ill fitted to exist in.This is all before we get to Clooney's Harry Pfarrer, a U.S. Marshall having an affair with Katie Cox (Swinton), the wife of C.I.A. higher-up Osborne Cox (Malkovich) whose compact disc those pesky gym employees have happened to stumble into contact with. It's an act on behalf of the U.S. government that sparks all this off, their demoting of Osborne signalling his resignation out of anger and the consequent embarking on the writing of his memoirs, a document you can understand will reveal the last 'x' number of years of C.I.A. work. By the end, The Coen's have got a little more political than perhaps they ever have been when they provide us with a scene that sees oblivious, dumbo government officials, sitting around discussing the eventual aftermath of the unholy mess they themselves have created. The film has begun with the removing of a higher-up from a position of power; innocents have since been caught up in the aftermath; many people have perished in the mean time and then the American government have, in a rather brutal fashion and through J.K. Simmons' character, brushed it aside in a foul swoop when taking responsibility and finding out why certain things went so wrong would be recommended. Read into whatever political under currents you like.Following Osborne's leaving of the service, he finds himself on a yacht out in the water with his father, informing him of the situation and talking of past decades when his father was in the force in a romanticised tone. He points at the ending of The Cold War as a moment that his line of work turned into something else as the boat seemingly drifts aimlessly out in the waters of nowhere, apparently going nowhere in the process, capturing what Osborne is feeling as he gazes off screen into the unknown. The best parts involve Osborne with the gym employees, Malkovich just about pulling off the scenes that require him to shout and badger people who are into something that's way over their heads, with Chad and Linda themselves trying to figure out the next plan of action; items that involve burglary and extortion in what is a passingly entertaining passage of play. The rest of it is a hit and miss meshing of romance and floundering on Clooney's and Swinton's behalf, barely any of it all that interesting but it somewhat eerily passes the time in an odd, numbing manner.Despite its light hearted tendencies within the genre, it's perhaps more involving than Ridley Scott's relatively pedestrian Body of Lies or either of Greengrass' two hollow; wishy-washy; turgid Bourne sequels which run on a premise but are practically devoid of character and narrative, the second sequel of which uses a bog-standard framework of self-discovery so as to provide a sense things are progressing. Clooney's consistent state of paranoia born out of the fact he believes he's being followed and the strong phobias plus reactions he has to the idea of surveillance actually addresses the issues at hand in a far more involving manner than either of the three aforementioned films. It's tough to get too excited about Burn After Reading, the directors' skill in film-making compensating for the brash, aggressive energy the piece carries but it's not enough to render it anything too great.",6,1,3,20 May 2010
The Killing Fields," Director Joffé makes a Killing on his first feature film, as the bond between two men form during a situation of extremities is explored.
","The Killing Fields opens with a voice-over telling us of a few brief, matter of fact items regarding the Asian locality of Camboida; a coming of speech which informs us of how The West see it as a lonely, isolated, untouched paradise over long shots of warm, tropical iconography in the form of low sunsets and palm trees. Where the compositions are rather picturesque and the supposed views glowing, The Killing Fields is a film more about the death and destruction going on within a corrupt and putrid nation; those of whom run it share similar characteristics. The suggestion that something is very wrong with the established Western view is hinted at when a large aircraft used for bombing raids ominously flies overhead, before we cut to a closer shot physically bringing us a little deeper into the locale thus revealing a young boy wearing a war helmet. In a basic sense, Utopian iconography of an 'untouched paradise' has been replaced by standard war genre codes; an un-Earthing of the truth after a prior stance has been just been deconstructed, the film itself a documenting of the atrocities that occurred within the nation of Cambodia between 1973 and 1975, and whose opening from the lead wonderfully ties in with his own experiences as we observe him at various points in the film try to uncover the truth about an event, within an event.Roland Joffé's quite wondrous film covers the true story of a man, an American journalist, named Sydney Schanberg here played by Sam Waterston and his friendship with several other men of western origin as well as native Cambodian photojournalist Dith Pran, played by the Oscar winning and now tragically deceased Haing S. Ngor. Joffé's film is a systematic deconstructing of this supposed myth the opening voice over speaks of and a somewhat effortless encompassing of post-war mental states linked to that of predominantly guilt as well as life as a prisoner of a new order on top of that. The film is a taut, mediative piece on one's actions and the decisions one makes in the heated coven of wartime whilst battling on the front-line, not as soldier with a gun but as a journalist with a camera, and how these shape the immediate situation as well as how these decisions made come to affect those involved years later; the centrepiece of which is a harrowing race against time when several characters are holed up in a building located in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh, as a man's life seems hours away from being ended due to incoming dangers.How it came to that is a tale altogether; the resulting misadventures born out of it additionally something else with the story of two men coming to understand one another under intensified circumstances the film's first port of call. When we begin with one of these men, we begin with Pran being chauffeured around town in a Mercedes, something which suggests importance; the presence of the car radio set to an American station playing out in English also suggesting bilinguality thus an education and the dialogue-free interactions he engages in with two passing monks as he walks past them on a public street hinting at not only respectful characteristics but perhaps a decent, positive reputation that he himself carries resulting in people stopping and bowing their heads to him. The characteristics are that of a binary opposition when placed up alongside those in the Cambodian Communist organisation known as The Khmer Rouge, the chief instigators of hate and fear throughout the film and the chaos and terror they instill into both the film and those involved later on because of the finale of the Vietnam War spilling out into the neighbouring nation.The film scatters the nationalities of most of the other first world, usually Capitalist, officials Schanberg and Pran deal with; a deliberate deploying of varying nationalities representative of The First World attempting some form of aid to those of Pran's ilk involved in the hardships, everything from Australia to Scotland to England to Russia. But the film is less bothered with the politics than it is of the true story of these two men linking up; Schanberg's relationship with Pran, like Pran's characteristics in regards to his own natives The Khmer Rouge, is in stark opposition to that of his getting along with The American Government, whom he berates from the beginning and clashes with on a number of personal and political points. After initially arriving and meeting with a relatively spaced out photojournalist named Al Rockoff (Malkovich), Schanberg is forced into travelling to the site of an American bombing raid with some locals when denied access to fly out along with the Americans; a later event as Schanberg attempts to practise liberalism in trying to photograph some atrocities leading to arrest and later realisation at press fabrication with what they perceived to have happened there that day.Pran's staying in Cambodia following evacuation orders on behalf of Schanberg leads him to a nightmarish post-war space of authority, totalitarianism and a strong military presence operating under a banner of a 'Year One' mentality. The distinction as to what sorts of environments each of the respective parties, Pran still in the Far East and Schanberg in New York City, inhabit in this: their post-Cambodia living, is pointed out via the kinds of mediums and sources of cultural indulgence they have access to or the ability to be exposed to. Where Schanberg is free to engage with the news; home video and opera, Pran is having to surrender to a dictatorship wanting to eradicate free thinking and bring everybody down to the same level. The finale and what transpires in leading up to it is fraught with angst and terror infused within both parties; a nerve-shredding trek in both a psychological and physical sense of either man desperate to be reunited. For this a many other things, the film is a triumph.",7,1,1,2 November 2010
The Italian Job," Thoroughly Enjoyable
","I wasn't expecting much from this film when I settled down to watch it.Hey, come on. It was a modern remake of one of the most famous British crime films of all time which STARRED one of the most famous British crime actors of all time; Michael Caine. However, I was proved wrong and I'm glad that I was.The ball is set in motion very impressively in the city of Venice when the gang and main actors attempt to rob some gold. One of the actors in this case was Jason Statham who played the character of 'Handsome Rob' I enjoyed his performances in two other great films of 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock' and he gives another great performance here as well. Each character has a certain uniqueness about them and we really seem to 'get to know them' as the film wears on.Impressive stunts and chases, madcap ideas in the form of manipulating L.A's traffic light system AND quite a few moments where you just can't work out what'll happen next or what'll happen now that a certain event HAS just happened. Each scene there is something new and unique about it that was different to the last scene. Something happens that moves the plot along. Something is either said or done by one of the characters that will make you either chuckle or continue watching with interest, something that I can only praise the scriptwriters for.I thought this new version of The Italian Job was well worth the money and the time spent watching it. It was an enjoyable film with some good acting, good action and a good, strong plot. Nothing better than that.",7,0,1,9 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'This is it, this'll be the furthest I've ever been away from home' - Fails as a journey of self discovery but succeeds as an epic action film with other things going for it.
","I suppose the one item at highest risk of aging in a film of this sort after several years is its CGI or its special effects; but thankfully this first Lord of the Rings film now comes across as a sort of fun and epic adventure film rather than a fantastic piece of film-making, the sort of which perhaps blinded people (and may still do now) into thinking they are seeing a fantastic film with great story telling and great action scenes. I'm a fan of the Indiana Jones films and I can enjoy films like The Mummy every once in a while and whilst this Lord of the Rings film is perhaps a level above these titles on a sense of scale, it is really nothing greater than that.I think by the end of the film, it has confused itself. The narrative has become disjointed, the path the film looked like it was heading down has been ignored and characterisation has reached such a basic level that I'm sure there are theorists and critics out there who could have probably told you who would've died and who wouldn't have; even if they had no prior knowledge of the novel. By the time the credits have begun rolling, we have seen Frodo Baggins (Wood) go on a leg of a journey, making friends, allies and developing friendships along the way but the issues are the surprisingly lacklustre story and poor development of the rest of the fellowship. Legolas (Bloom) is a mere face; Boromir (Bean) is merely someone who is present to play out the role of the supposed 'spy in the camp' as he tries to goad the ring away from Frodo when he needs to; Gimli (Rhys-Davies) is another character who is placed, follows orders and fights when needed; also contributing to the film's inclusion of mediocre plot points when it is his idea to travel through the mines of Moria, a Dwarven kingdom and the other three hobbits are there for mere comedy. If you look at how the other three hobbits came into being in the fellowship, you'll see that Sam (Astin) was eavesdropping at a window and the other two were stealing crops from a field that Frodo and Sam just happened to be passing  these are pretty poor character introductions and the three are never developed beyond the butt of most jokes.But what The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring lacks in characterisation; it makes up for in scale, vision, entertainment and ideas. The film also benefits from a good director; Peter Jackson it would seem knows how to make a good film and toy with his audience: Sam states that he though he'd lost Frodo at one point when he lags behind, only for the two other hobbits to come bursting out of the field and bump into both Frodo and Sam. Whilst the introduction is crude and it is played out for a cheap thrill, Jackson combines Sam's fear of loosing Frodo with the relief that he's caught up with him and then back to the fear that something will go wrong when two unknown subjects burst into the frame, forcing us and the characters to jump. Jackson also makes the film very early on seem upbeat and jovial; the characters are in possession of an item of Armageddon and yet the film has an upbeat and somewhat relaxed atmosphere to it. This is most evident when Bilbo (Holm) hosts his birthday party and everyone is seen to have fun in a relaxed and somewhat cheesy manner; the evidence is also there when Bilbo thanks everyone for coming and goes through his family members. But this is good directing because it lulls us into a false sense of security; everything is fine and upbeat early on and yet the film will delve deeper into a darker and more disturbed groove once the adventure has begun; dealing with obsession and madness through Gollum as well as tackling issues of trust and friendship between Frodo, Sam and the fellowship itself.So during the birthday party, there are two examples that hint at this disturbing 'to-come' undertone: Bilbo's speech starts off jovial before turning 'dark' when he disappears but it turns out that was all a joke anyway; immediately returning to the film's jovial nature. The second example is when everyone is having fun; a firework in the form of a dragon swoops down on the hobbits, they start screaming and panicking but it flies over and explodes: everyone is happy again. These are mini-examples of the film overall displayed within the first third. There is also the clever atmosphere put across after the hobbits initially escape the hooded riders; they encounter an obnoxious gatekeeper and go to a rough pub  are they now safe from the riders? It seems not as nothing gets in these people's way. But the script and story is what lacks here, apart from basic logic at times. The hooded riders actually run away from the wave, rather than keeping on going or turning around and Gandalf (McKellen) does not mention the danger of the Balrog before going into Moria.The film also suffers with its musical score; an unusual thing to be critical of. I've established the film begins in a light hearted manner but then grows darker and yet the score keeps a certain level of softness which culminates in the film actually ending in an upbeat manner. Two great friends have died and two more are taken but the film tiptoes around this, suggesting too obviously that 'the adventure continues....' Whilst the film is fantastic in its broad and epic scale, it does not work on its own as a journey of self discovery for Frodo and Sam. The most interesting character is not the hero but Gandalf himself and when that is the case in a film like this, you are struggling in certain areas.",7,0,0,10 February 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," The Wachowski's raise the stakes, and with it shorten the margin for error; as inconsistencies and frustrations mar the final installment of the Matrix franchise.
","The Matrix Revolutions marked a sorry end for one of, certainly at the beginning, the most creative; most original science fiction films running on a smart premise we'd seen for some time. Where smarts; intelligence and well drawn nightmarish worlds complete with engaging ideas to do with life, existence, the universe and everything was once the predominant item on the menu, all has given way in the second Matrix sequel to flurries of 'What on EARTH!?' moments; uninvolving love stories and dull causality culminating in a stupefying Tekken inspired fight sequence between two characters. The Wachowski's ideas featured in 1999's The Matrix were reigned in; they were kept in check, never feeling as if they were bigger than the project itself and explored in a dramatic and thoroughly substantial manner. The Matrix Revolutions appears tired with its origins, bored even; like the cleverest student in the class whom sits at the back just not feeling up to it on the day of the big exam, and falling just a little short of the pass mark when so much more was expected of them.As the piece crawled towards the end of its one hundred and twenty five odd minute run time, nearly all sense of immersement and respect for the trilogy was on the way out of the window, and I was praying their God-like Architect character would simply walk onto the screen, turn to the camera, hold up a remote control of some kind and just press a button that would make the screen go black. 'Now, we are finished.......' he would bellow in a gruff, low, robotic tone. What we get is something just as stupid, but less amusing. Revolutions is the point The Matrix ceases to be a science fiction film about ideas complete with an initial, original vision; now rendered a dorky war-come-action film which pastes on a dull love story or two involving the leads and their supporting acts so as to try and insert a bit of heart into proceedings, amidst the gradually less and less interesting teenage orientated spectacle.The war between man and machine has reached its crescendo, the ultimate showdown between flesh and blood and metal and A.I. has arrived after burning at the back on a hob throughout 2003's other Matrix sequel entitled Reloaded. The eponymous hero of this now chore of a franchise, Neo (Reeves), is stuck in a strange zone of purgatory masquerading as a subway station and cannot get out to aid in the overall struggle. His mentor, love interest and cohorts in the form of the usual suspects Morpheus (Fishburne) and Trinity (Moss) skulk around looking for him as all sorts of different parties, in the form of programmes trussed up in human-being form, knock back nonsense banter about whatever self indulgent; self gratifying themes and subjects the Wachowski's feel they need to instill into the film. One trip to an underground fetishistic themed nightclub contains a fight sequence with guns complete with a stunt that reminded me of the finale to 2001's 3000 Miles to Graceland, the instance in which a guy comes spinning into view from the ceiling with dual machine guns blazing – not a good thing. Having taken two whole films to establish guns are useless in this universe, and pose little threat to those whom fight, it's a wonder the characters still proceed in using them. But it's all spectacle, and most probably acted as good trailer fodder.There doesn't seem to be much in the way of spine to Revolutions, people flit and hop from incident to incident without much clarity nor apparent reason. One is left persistently wondering where most of the supporting acts stand in their stance on the war overall, the film's complete lack of a hierarchy in this world full of sides, warring existences and clashing ideologies exposing the film-makers' inability to go 'better' after having already gone 'bigger'. Where does a Frenchman and his girlfriend, of whom he seems to have forgiven for her betrayal in the last film, stand? What about the creator and aforementioned God-like character The Architect? Where does he fit into rouge Agent Smith's plans, as an army of machines and their tank equivalents named Sentinels brood in their bid to destroy the human city of Zion. Does any of it matter if The Architect is able to reset everything and play God – does it matter if Zion is annihilated? Nearer the very end, a middle age black woman named The Oracle mopes her way onto screen after some prior interactions with an array of people; where did she fit into all of this and whose side was she on? Whom outranks whom? What does the train driver think of everything? Something may be grossly at stake, but none of it actually matters.Further pain is inflicted onto the audience during the 'big showdown', a massive fight sequence between the mechanical equivalents of a large spider hybridised with a wasp and named Sentinels with the ground troops of the humans in Zion. Here, the film's shortcomings become grossly apparent in that archetypal mannequins in a young soldier out to prove himself; a General, whom comes complete with a Braveheart inspired speech to rally the troops, and the non-soldiers in the form of two women whom feel the need to take the fight to the enemy, systematically allowing the makers to make it look as if they're addressing the issue of female empowerment amidst this war-zone, begin to take over as central to providing us with human characters as the spectacle moves in. Agonisingly, amidst the millions of people in Zion at the end, it's the General and the grunt whom just happened to bump into one another. Small incidences like that only fuel the feeling of the film's robotic, metallic and dulling temperament; where once was freshness and excitement is now occupied by the droll and incidental, and it sure is relieving to know it's all over.",5,6,10,8 August 2010
28 Weeks Later," As far as sequels go; it's impressive. Just don't expect anything too groundbreaking given the state of horror films these days.
","Five years after one of the most original horror films, arguably ever, was made; 28 Weeks Later does things most sequels don't do and that's manage to hold its own when compared to the first film. It does this through a series of conventions that hit and miss the mark.Some things I was happy with, others I was not so impressed with. I was pleased that the basics were kept intact. Often a new director means new ideas or taking existing ones and messing around with them. Director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, from Spain, hadn't had much work before he did this film but he'll get the jobs he probably deserves now. Fresnadillo has kept everything that made 'the infected' as creepy as they were in 28 Days Later as well as giving us a refreshing, 'return to the scene of the crime' feel as London gets an attempt at re-population now that Britain has become one massive ghost town. The empty shots of London have been recycled and have once again, worked very effectively; only this time with CGI being put to good use for a change.28 Days Later is one of my favourite films and reasons for this include its atmosphere and its look. Although the idea of shooting on DV right up until the final scenes have been banished; 28 Weeks Later still manages to retain that eerie, dark and noticeably un-easy look its predecessor also had. This is put across using a string of close ups in numerous scenes, lingering camera work, delaying the inevitable to the point of minor frustration and actually having a scene in total pitch black to the characters that we can only witness through a night vision lens in the point-of-view format.What also works is the way the film builds up the character of Don (Robert Carlyle) and his family, giving off a feeling of family ties/familiarity before completely changing suit and going with the kids and the survivors once the initial incident happens. This is quite similar to Hitchcock's tactic he used in Psycho (1960) when the character of Marion Crane was built up to the point the film centred around her; before changing its drive and going down a different route.What I didn't like too much was the way the film has that oddly familiar feeling that most other modern day horrors have. Yes, it's a sequel to 28 Days Later which immediately gives it 'cred'. but the use of over the top (and extremely unnecessary) gore as well as the fast paced, all action second third the film threatened to succumb to was disappointing as most modern day horror films often give in to the temptation of having style over content. Some of the scenes I'm referring to are: when a sniper is pinning them down in the streets (when he should have been air evacuated minutes earlier) and when a certain character becomes infected and acts in an ultra-violent manner towards someone else yet when another character sees him at the end of a street later on; he doesn't run to attack them (like someone infected should do) but merely disappears. These things aren't ghosts; they're as close to zombies as you can get and can't vanish out of thin air.What's also disappointing is it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously at times. Some scenes have flaws behind them and merely act as excuses for action (the sniper scene like I said and the fact the boy near the beginning states he was being chased yet nobody thought the infected would eventually arrive, thus attacking the place they were holed up in) which is a shame as in 28 Days Later; each action and event the characters did on their seemingly endless journey nearly always had a problem that had to be dealt with.Also, the new Wembley stadium pops up in a painfully obvious attempt to identify some modern day iconography. In ten years no one will probably care or even notice but the clue is in the title, Mr. Screenwriter: '28 Weeks Later'; the film is still taking place in 2002 or 2003. The scene in Wembley was unnecessary as it could've happened in any open space or park; I mean, come on; even the goal posts were set up and ready! On the whole, 28 Weeks Later is a good film that provides scares, thrills and some excellent cinematography. Just don't be too put off by the flaws and frustrations.",7,0,1,16 May 2007
The Village," A Film that tests the viewers attention and forces them to think for themselves about the probability of something being believable or not. Clever and engaging.
","The Village is one of those films that comes very close to perhaps being one of the greatest ever made, it also comes close to being one of the biggest cheats ever put across in film and thus; comes closer still to being one of the worst ever made. I was undecided after viewing it very recently and I'm still undecided now  maybe time will clear my mind and maybe my opinion will change somewhat. I'm sure there are people that hate The Village because people like to be shown things that they recognise and like to be told what's what; but not here as here, you have to exercise your mind.I'm all for 'twist' endings. I think the twist, when used correctly can be the one reason for a films greatness. Sometimes it's used well with The Usual Suspects being an excellent example as clues and hidden messages in something so immaterial as someone's eyes focusing on a certain thing can be the difference between knowing and not knowing. Other times, such as in De Palma's 2002 film Femme Fatale, the whole thing falls flat on its face leaving us cheated, angry and sad. The Village's twist works and if you watch it with no knowledge of it and without having seen any trailers or clips prior to the film; it really, really works.I didn't quite know what to think at the end of The Village. On one had, it's a very clever film that has you believe one thing, leads you down a path and then pulls out the path from under you but on another hand, it's a complete waste of time  a mere exercise in 1890s mise-en-scene, cinematography and dialogue that is shot, edited and then has a silly revelation attached to the end. Shyamalan is no fool when it comes to hinting at his story. The film was marketed as a horror film but I think this was deliberate to throw you off. I was surprised at the different genres The Village seemed to fall into: there was the horror, of course but then there was the element of fantasy, look at it logically: It's 1890s America and all these people are living in fear of monsters that live in a nearby wood with no other community around for miles except beyond the dreaded wood. The people also seem too submissive to the monsters since they encroach and kill livestock and yet just like in Signs and Lady in the Water, people would rather run and hide than face them and fight  similarly to what I said about Lady in the Water: the problem is nothing a 12 gauge wouldn't solve (or a similar firearm given it's the 1890s) The film also contains elements of the fantasy genre. When a character stated that she had her 'memories locked up in that box', I thought 'how the hell do you lock a memory in a box?' Given the what the film has us believe up until this point, I expected it to be this big, glowing ball of energy that rises up out of whatever it's in: how else is a 'memory' supposed to look in a physical form? From here, The Village becomes a love story very briefly with murder and heartache playing a large role. The film changes direction again: you don't get love stories in horror films as in depth and crisp as this one; another tick in the film's 'negative' column. But wow, was I wrong. The reason I mention all these things is that there is a logical explanation for it all and I knew there would be. The film isn't set in another dimension or another world, why would it be? It hasn't been established like it was in Lord of the Rings so you have to assume its here and now on Planet Earth. The Village looks like it has so many things wrong with it from frame one and yet thinking back after you know the ending, everything makes sense. Even if it seems bad and incorrect at the time, does it make it bad and incorrect if there's a reason for it? One example of what I'm saying can be seen in the character of Ivy Walker (Howard). A village elder sends her to the next town through the haunted woods but she's blind  great idea, huh? Not only this but she doesn't set off at dawn to beat the dark and she and her accomplice stop when it rains instead of keeping going to avoid illness or the monsters. All of these things sound suicidal and at the time, I was wondering what the hell they were all thinking; and yet it all makes sense when you look back following the revelation: why would someone send a blind person on a dangerous mission involving cannibalistic monsters, shortly before it gets dark? The answer is not as difficult as you think.The Village is a criss-cross of genres; ranging from horror, thriller, fantasy, romance and possibly science fiction but it's not what you think since the film actually changes genre towards the end to something else that probably doesn't even exist  that itself is an achievement. Despite the lingering shots of empty rocking chairs and bare trees blowing in the wind adding an avant-garde feel (but keeping you alert as you try and work out why they're there, pointlessly), The Village maintains concentration and attention throughout without being too un-obvious.",6,1,3,4 November 2007
The Revenant," An unmissable experience.
","If 'The Revenant' doesn't contribute in some way to revitalising the Western genre, it is likely nothing ever will. The film is a remarkable experience; an example of what happens when each and all of the various aspects of film-making - original soundtrack; cinematography; second unit direction; imagery, etc. - fuse together as effectively as perhaps they are able to in order to deliver something quite extraordinary. 'The Revenant' unfolds in a place inherently dreary, yet somehow beautiful at the same time; takes place in a setting absolutely deadly, yet possesses a strange tranquillity to it. Mostly every scene or sequence is bookended by a magnificent composition of a mountain or a skyline of trees which you sense might succeed as an award winning photograph all by itself. It takes place in a world drenched in war; hurt; pain; loss and cynical opportunism (you can practically feel the grief dripping off the screen as to watch it), and while it is entirely its own film, somehow manages to draw on the best from other works of its sort (which range from 'Into the Wild' and 'Apocalypto' to Terrence Malick) in order to supplement the experience it's delivering to you. Primarily, Alejandro Iñárritu's film is about the bourgeoning conflict between two men which then erupts into a tale of revenge as one goes after the other in the wake of a murder. One of these men is Hugh Glass, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is guiding a troupe of (mostly) American fur-trappers to a fort through the barren winter wilderness of where the United States appears to meet Canada. Glass, mistrusted by some of the crew as to having previously lived with the indigenous peoples of this terrain, and having previously apparently shot an allied soldier, is already grieving the death of his wife and the destruction of his village some years ago at the hands of the French Colonialists. His infant son, however, survived and now travels with him.The simplicity of Glass' exercise is complicated by an ambush they suffer by a group of Native American Indians: an event which forces the trappers downstream and deeper into the hostile wilderness from which they entrust Glass can guide them. Not interested in seventy year old stereotypes, Iñárritu bothers to cut back to the Indians who reveal themselves to be searching for the kidnapped daughter of the enraged chief and are therefore allowed an extra dimension. We actually want them to find her.'The Revenant' then completely changes gears when, inexplicably, it has its protagonist attacked by a grizzly bear to the extent that it very nearly kills him. What set out as a, and certainly would have been decades ago, somewhat standard adventure story of a lost group of people evading Indians and bandits (Mexicans; the French, etc.) through untamed North America ends up as something very different. Space here is limited as to the extent I want to get across just how impressed with 'The Revenant' I really was. What struck me the most was the way the film subverted the traditional action-movie character arc in BEGINNING with its lead in the worst possible state (bloodied and beaten) before only later becoming ready for the climactic 'showdown' when they are able-bodied. It is in the aftermath of the bear attack that two volunteers remain behind to care for him, as the rest of the trappers press on to the fort. One of these is Tom Hardy's John Fitzgerald - a mumbling, grizzled Texan with money problems who has his own reasons for hating Indians. Iñárritu uses a combination of techniques to disguise the eventual conflict between the two men as mere small talk amidst a platoon of men just wanting to get back to base with their scalps intact. When the first 'shot' of the film rings out, it is from Glass' rifle and the film cuts quite deliberately to Hardy's character reacting to it in the far distance - their binary natures are then established when it is revealed Fitzgerald only wants to save the 'pelt' skins they have accumulated on the expedition, while Glass tries to rescue as many fellow trappers as possible following the Indian raid. Later, we witness verbal conflict on-board the escape-barge and then over Glass' son's ethnicity - were it not for the captain, who has authority over both of them and has already asserted it over Fitzgerald on the barge via an exchange in profile over whether to disembark, we sense they would resort to blows. The culmination of these exchanges spill over into the second act of the film and form Glass' ultimate goal, when Fitzgerald's hatred of Indians has combined with his superiority complex to lead him to do what he does. Watching Glass' recovery; escapade and catharsis is truly something to behold. Perhaps the film's most impressive characteristic is its sheer nihilism: this is not a film wherein anybody really wins (except for, maybe, the Indians) Nobody's actions brings back their deceased loved ones; the world remains an incredibly savage, existential place full of death, pain, grief and natural selection - tomorrow, as today, a pack of wild dogs will savagely bring down a buffalo in order to eat him - time continues ticking, inevitably, towards whatever the future holds for us. Everyone (those few who survive) is largely worse off for what they experience in the film. Whatever you take from the film the most, there can be little denying that 'The Revenant's' is a powerful accomplishment.",8,0,0,15 April 2018
The Hills Have Eyes," Disgusting and unnecessary film that offers nothing bar that adrenaline kick once the pain causers get their comeuppance.
","Yes, it's one of those films that's so gruesome and nasty you're either going to enjoy it and love it for its pure, out and out effectiveness or hate it for the exact same reason. Horror as a genre has that ability, like comedy, to produce content some will take to but others will not. The Hills Have Eyes to some will be a thrill ride of adrenaline and eventual retribution played out in glorious, grimy, grungy cinematography; to others it'll be a freak show with few redeeming features. Truth is, the film is more of a freak show with few redeeming features than it is an intelligent and interesting exercise in horror but comes complete with daft metaphors and ill logic at times.The original was made at a time when the genre was on the cusp of a wave. 1972's Deliverance and 1974's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre helped launch the idea of out-of-towners stranded, lost and helpless in a wilderness unbeknownst to them. Wes Craven's 1977 version was about a family getting stranded right where they didn't want to be and the 2006 remake is a similar set up: place the pigeons exactly where you want them and unleash the cats.The trouble is The Hills Have Eyes is just this followed by an orgy of buckets of blood, violence and disturbance. It's not like Deliverance or Hooper's 'Chainsaw' movie in the sense it doesn't incorporate the location as a third element to the character's survival (as the forests of Deliverance did) but merely renders the desert in which it's set a large, open space people must take ages in travelling through. Additionally, it lacks the sense of danger Hopper's 'Texas Chainsaw' had, which gave us a fair amount of suspense and disturbance in equal measure, as seen in the dinner table scene nearer the end and the chase through the woods/country house prior to that. The Hills Have Eyes ignores elements of chase and setting up a potentially nasty encounter and skips straight to the shock and horror of it all.The film begins with a montage of nuclear weapons being tested which immediately reminded me of the opening of 1998's Godzilla, but it is as much about nuclear testing and makes about as much-a statement on nuclear testing as Godzilla did, which is zilch. Once the set up has been done and a gas station attendant has an attacks of morals, the film gets going; descending into its messy and needlessly unpleasant procession. Throughout the course of the film, we will get to see loved one's watch their other loved ones burnt to death whilst being alive the whole time. We will also get to see someone else being raped in front of the family members, also watching on, and in clear, obvious un-comfort – is this supposed to be entertaining? Is this the level these action/horror hybrids have sunk to? But the film isn't just a series of scenes in which we get to see harmless, innocent people suffer at the hands of creatures that get no introduction bar a nuclear testing montage and a small title paragraph of information. The film is about a band of Americans; a band of Americans in a desert locale getting horribly picked off one by one by an enemy they have no clue to either: how to defeat at first; where they are coming from or what they even are. Parallels could be read into to do with the Iraq war or general conflict in the middle east and it may well be that people look back at this film in years to come as some sort of parallel to these events.Talking of the location being a large and wide open space that bamboozles and forces the family to cover large distances, why is it that the mutants whom eventually show themselves are able to negotiate and hide within the canyons whenever the family try to intercept or chase them down? Some of the more would-be humbling scenes such as one family member discovering a graveyard of previous victims' cars have been done before, recently in a film entitled Wrong Turn so the impact does not hit you like the makers want it to and thus, it comes off as uninspiring and flat.I think The Hills Have Eyes is supposed to be a thrill-a-minute, action film that entertains and scares in equal measure but it's more of one, long sick procession of gore and unpleasantness that nobody needs to see – was there a point to all of this? Even more-so, was there a point of remaking the original? One element of real distaste arrives in the form of a young female character who sunbathes in a bikini, is provocatively shot and states she'd 'rather be in Cancun' – it's clear the audience is supposed to be attracted to her since she's shot accordingly so. It is when that character is raped later on that we get to see possible repressed fantasies the film embedded within our psyche earlier on, getting played out. Like this tiny element and the Iraq war situation acting as a metaphorical backdrop, the film is needless and unpleasant thus allowing most people to come away from the film thinking they've seen something brilliant, purely because they've been taken on a roller-coaster of thrills, spills and surging hormones – what a shame.",5,1,2,1 December 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," Cute without ever really committing itself to anything, the film enjoys its diverting road movie approach and its quaint laughs but is difficult to get too excited about.
","Six people in a bright yellow VW camping van, each of them as wildly different to the next, travelling and therefore forced into being thrust together as they journey to California for something. One's a suicidal academic; one's a disgruntled elderly man; one's a rebellious, frizzy haired adolescent who's refusing to speak; one's a middle of the road housewife; one's an easy-going, likable husband and father who's just trying to do the best for those he loves and one's a girl of about ten whom thinks the world is her oyster. There you go, there's your pitch and such a wildly uneven premise to a film is only fitting given how sporadic and only mildly diverting Little Miss Sunshine really is. The idea is you pick the character you see most representative of you, and map onto them as they all plough on together.The film is good natured but it's ultimately a little flat and uninvolved, relying on comedic content that I didn't find so comedic and a rich amount of symbolism representing what these people are thinking and feeling, the kind of which we are all able to figure out anyway. Take the instance early on, for example, in which Frank (Carell), housewife Sheryl's (Collette) suicidal brother, sits deathly alone in a hospital area after a recent bout of suicidal ideation; the camera situated so as to capture how it is he feels and where he is in life; or later on, in which, whilst meeting a business cohort by a swimming pool somewhere, father and husband Richard (Kinnear) talks of how he's struggling but really trying to wade through all the issues and problems his life skills company has hit as a completely unrelated person swims by, or wades by, in the water, systematically representational of his own plight. The film likes the idea of linking commonplace places and events onto a wider spectrum of struggle, manifested within its lead characters.I think I was supposed to feel surprised; be humoured; feel angered and then rather pleased at most of what happens in Little Miss Sunshine, throughout. The film sees young Olive (Breslin), youngest of the Hoover family based in New Mexico, pine to be an entrant into a beauty contest in California; something that everyone eventually all agrees in heading off to. Being a road movie of sorts, the film is given all kinds of reasons to have all manner of wacky items crop up to bulk out the runtime and deliver a few feint laughs along the way. Yes, they get partially lost; yes, they're pulled over by the police and yes, the van does indeed break down, that then resulting in a rather annoying reoccurring gag that sees them have to keep it in a consistent state of motion so as to avoid having to kill the ignition. Once you've mapped yourself onto either the screwy, oddball, Nietzsche reading son Dwayne (Dano) if you're of that ilk; or the toothy, smiley, beaming Sheryl if you're of that ilk; or the disgruntled elderly gentleman Edwin (Arkin) if you're of that ilk, then there's no limit in the manner of fun you may or may not have in watching these wacky misadventures unfold.Despite it having its characters roll along toward their destination, the film is almost certainly circular in its structure; allowing a number of the characters to progress from various states to otherwise different. One character is alive and well prior to the trip, but dead by the time it's concluded; the same with another character of whom remains mute for most of the duration, but undergoes a discovery and we observe how that changes him whereas someone else has a definitive dream at the start but realises they were well out of their depth when the time comes to live it. The respective arcs are sweet enough, harmless in their basic establishing; evolving and then placing into a newer order but it's little more than mildly engaging. The writer, a certain Michael Arndt, is, I think, a little worried that all the wavy, messy content will bury what it is he wants to say and that's highlighted in a scene between two characters whom share the piece's moment of pure exposition: a sequence in which, standing on a pier with the wide open ocean behind them, they speak of life and life being what you make it and that one needs to suffer in order to journey or learn. The seemingly endless ocean behind them acting as a clear representation of the great unknown, a link to what unknown delights await you within the vast mass of everything.The film is a wavy and sporadic effort; desperately wanting the quirky fact they're all travelling to where they're going in a bright yellow VW van to attain a sort of instantly recognisable, if not 'cult', status. Along the way, the film will provide a range of wacky scenes which ought to feel more heartfelt than they actually are when Edwin, the eldest character, who it's established is a drug addict, passes on advice to the youngest in Olive and takes on a kind of mentor role but it just comes off as a little creepy more than anything. The film tackles death as an issue and how it affects families when a certain character is removed from the text but does so with a pinch of salt rather than with a full blooded exploration of any kind. In short, it's a mildly diverting road picture hybrid which is a little off colour in tone but with a few laughs; certain instances contained within demonstrate directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' eye for film-making and this was clearly a project that they were really up for, but the film does too much if anything; wildly chopping from one locale to another and cramming too many characters doing and experiencing too much, all of which mysteriously combines into something rather underwhelming.",6,2,4,6 May 2010
North by Northwest," Combining that element of chase, espionage and sheer horror combined with action; North By Northwest is a winner.
","North by Northwest manages to cover just about every emotion you might feel during a good, old fashioned romp. There are scenes in the film of great, comic timing; there are sequences when you are frightened for the characters; there are times when you're frustrated or angry at certain occurrences and there are others when the film dips into potential romance and you experience the emotions that come with that. The whole film-watching experience is, of course, juxtaposed by Cary Grant's relaxed and somewhat methodical approach to everything – encouraging a certain ease on the audience, like a parent or guardian comforting a child with the words 'it's only a movie' every so often.North By Northwest reminded me of a film from 1945 named 'Detour', a short, sharp and quite brilliant little B-movie. But Hitchcock knows what he's doing here, shooting and constructing North by Northwest as the sort of film you mightn't expect many people to turn up for; shooting and constructing it like the sort of film that, if a lot of people did turn up, wouldn't expect an awful lot out of. Hitchcock throws caution to the wind, dabbling in and out of a couple of genres; twisting audience emotion and redefining film language all at once.Very early on in the film, we are established to be on a busy New York street. Cary Grant's lead character named Roger Thornhill walks, talks and mingles with whoever he needs to as other pedestrians try to get the better of others on a minute scale by hogging the pavement as they get on with whatever they're doing. The opening establishes a few things, namely Roger's quick wit and ability to gauge scenarios in fast moving and bustling locations. This is put across via the incidence during which he manages to hail a cab amidst the chaos and acts as a precursor for things to come when his skills will be pushed to much further extremes. Incidentally, the beginning is supposed to get across this chaotic 'world' full of 'one-upmanship', in which the film will take place, further in which people exist to get the better of one another. The notion of a busy street on which you must keep your wits about you purely to be able to walk without hassle is Hitchcock fore-warning the themes of the film's narrative, a film in which there will be 'others' out looking to damage those un-alert, and it is Thornhill's own qualities that ultimately take him as far as he goes.The set up involves mistaken identity and Thornhill getting snatched from a prior arrangement by some thugs to meet a certain Phillip Vandamm (Mason), who mistakes him for someone else named George Kaplan. Through one reason or another, and an early example of Hitchcock deliberately veering off into some sort of realm of horror, Thornhill is dumped and left for dead by the thugs, but takes it on himself to figure out who Kaplan really is. What follows is a framing for murder and a 'A 3000 MILE CHASE . . . That blazes a trail of TERROR to a gripping, spine-chilling climax!'; at least according to the tag-line – but you'd be pretty hard pressed not to agree with the statement anyway.From here, North by Northwest doesn't really let up. Its countless inspirations since can range from anything from Three Days of the Condor, to the film THAT inspired ie; The Bourne Identity to a similarly easy-on-the-eye-and-mind 2004 B-Movie entitled Cellular. The cause and effect driven idea shoots from one location to another, incorporating all sorts of frightening but entertaining ideas and scenes. The film pauses for sexual tension, laughs and thrills in equal measure; never loosing sight of its Cold War era driven aura of espionage, politics, mistaken identity and chase.Following the framing for murder, Thornhill travels to Chicago for what should be a meeting Kaplan was due to attend. It is on the train travelling to this destination he meets Eve Kendall (Saint), a character Hitchcock brilliantly sets up by having her recognise Thornhill as the man wanted by police but refrains from turning him in. The very dangerous persona that is set up for Eve is confirmed when, in addition to not particularly flinching when she discovers who Thornhill is, she quite easily lies to police regarding Thornhill's whereabouts by hiding him in a her train compartment.As the film develops, particular narrative ideas to do with undercover agents and microfilms open up but I find it remarkable that this film, with all the elements of paranoia and mistaken identity with somewhat of a labyrinth of a narrative that opens up in due course, seems to be mostly remembered for its individual scenes: a crop dusting chase, an escape on Mount Rushmoor and a particularly eye-brow raising final shot. We all know about Psycho and the shower scene and who gets killed there and what the twist is; we all know about Rear Window and that a certain someone is in a helpless physical position as things tighten around them, but here, popular culture hasn't seemed to have ruined what is, essentially, a really well played out thriller with plot twists, turns and frightening set pieces. While always seemingly remembered for individual moments, North by Northwest is a truly wonderful picture that presents a genuinely likable lead; throws them into the firing line; develops other characters accordingly and rounds it all off with a brilliantly unravelled plot complete with current affairs for the day, surely one of Hitchcock's finest.",8,1,3,12 May 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Healthy and well executed continuation of the series, not submitting to genre convention while exploring its leads in an impressive manner.
","Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to hold up for me, on subsequent viewings. I took to it the first time I saw it, and have since been quite surprised by the level of antagonism most people have toward it. The film is far from the disaster it could have been; it draws on inspiration from the previous two films and rather than aim to go bigger and better, it actually opts to go underneath them – this, it most certainly achieves. Drawing on the fast moving element of chase and the very bleak atmosphere the first film had, Terminator 3 delivers as a downbeat and briskly paced thriller with a science-fiction twist. It additionally works as a polished action film, something the second Terminator film was, with numerous action set pieces but with additional substance in the form of studies of individuals and their hardened bodies. Unlike the second film, however, which offered hope at the end of the narrative; Terminator 3 sticks to its guns and concludes on a downbeat tone, echoing the first film and setting up what will be a supposed number of sequels.I think a lot of people dislike the film because they're told to dislike the film; almost as if people are frightened of reading too much into the text. Yes, Cameron had no input to its production; yes, the enemy Terminator is a female; yes, Schwarzenegger's 'good' Terminator is a lot less sympathetic and there's a smaller focus on man and machine co-existing, but so what? The film remains an interesting character piece, establishing would-be hard bodied heroes and fleshing them out. On the other strand, it tells the tale of a certain military individual by name of Lieutenant General Robert Brewster (Andrews) and his final developments, along with the United States Air Force, of a complicated new weapons system they inherited from Cyberdyne Systems following their destruction in the second film. Brewster jokingly, but ominously, talks about how he wants to keep humans and their decisions 'in the loop' when it comes to co-existing with machines.The film begins with a now adult John Connor (Stahl), a nobody, an everyday guy whom does some work here and there; drifts on his motorcycle; rues the death of his mother Sarah and sits atop high bridges late at night with a beer, quite possibly contemplating suicide. The first glimpses of this individual goes against the more typical image of an action genre lead: John is weak and a relative nobody, whilst possesses very few skills. He will once again get put through the survival grinder as Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his third innings as his career defining role, is sent back to 2003 to protect him from a more advanced enemy robot named the T-X (Loken), a female super-assassin who is five times the antagonist the T-1000 was in terms of both power and ability. Like Robert Patrick's role, and to a degree Schwarzenegger's in the first film, the film opts for a relative unknown in Kristanna Loken who pulls off her role with the same anonymity and menace as her predecessors.Going through the grinder with John and the T-850 Terminator is Kate Brewster (Danes), the daughter of the aforementioned Robert of high military importance. Kate is the film's secondary study of a would-be hard bodied character; she successfully goes from squealing, screaming veterinarian to miniature Hunter Killer destroyer-come-soldier in what is a moment of realisation by both characters that she is of that material – those that groan in disappointment at this occurrence are those that have completely missed the study in transition, thus going back to what I say about people being afraid to read too much into it. Much earlier on, she additionally displays a hardened attitude when she outsmarts John, mistaking him for a junkie breaking into the veterinarian hospital, and locks him in an animal cage. Kate advances, emotionally, as she looses those she loves and becomes more weary of the situation.The T-X acts as an interesting element to the film. The filmmakers have not updated the 'role' of the antagonistic robot purely to be different and offer variation in the role. Rather, they have allowed the most powerful character in the entire film to be a woman, something that is relatively unheard of in today's action genre. Equally refreshing is the refraining from turning both the T-X and Kate into objects of desire, forever developing and fleshing out one as the other ponders a woman's role in the new world she been transported back to when she observes a bra advertisement board asking us 'What is Sexy?' For those out for the set pieces, the film includes a few scenes of great action: the initial coming together of the robotic forces and the ensuing escape/acquiring of Kate and John as well as a shootout and consequent escape at a cemetery, during which Earl Boen gets an amusing cameo. The Terminator and the TX have an additional hand-to-hand fight in a public bathroom. The film is, essentially, a tragedy rather than a glorification of violence or a fetishisation of explosions. It documents mankind's inability to come to terms with the weapons they have at their disposal and modernity in general. I find Terminator 3 to be interesting in its own right, and worthy of a place on the mantle amongst the first two, but to echo Sarah Connor's words as she journeys to destroy the Cyberdyne building in Terminator 2: furthering the franchise into the future is 'a venture into the unknown, a making up of history as we go along'. It may yet prove to be futile and a bit of a miss-judgement and that, like judgement day, money-making sequels to established franchises 'are inevitable'.",6,3,4,17 May 2009
The Orphanage," The Orphanage is no orphan, in fact it's actually related and linked to several other recent films.
","In a way, I feel sorry for El Orfanato director Juan Antonio Bayona, a man who has had a lot of studio backing from a lot of different companies, all of which pop up at the beginning of the film; a man who is under a lot of pressure to perform following the backing of said studios and a certain Guillermo del Toro whose 2006 film Pan's Labyrinth is clearly an inspiration for this piece; and I feel sorry for the director in the sense the film has come off as rather a dud, recycling old material and presenting us with few freights on top of a hollow film viewing experience.I mentioned Guillermo del Toro just a second ago; the aesthetic of this film and obvious visual inspiration from Pan's Labyrinth is clear, making El Orfanato come across as an attempt to cash in on said film's recent US and European success by way of quickly churning out another Spanish language film; with del Toro's name splashed all over it; that falls into the genre of horror but perhaps ambiguously so and recreating the exact same mood and visual image. For Spain but maybe more so for Mexico, Pan's Labyrinth now comes across as these two nation's golden ticket  their Spielberg's 'Jaws' if you like; a film that if marketed correctly, with the right names all over it and one that falls into an array of genres, it'll draw in the crowds and the money.I for one loved Pan's Labyrinth, but when it is used to be manipulated into an excuse for further films that carry the same look and feel and 'presented' (whatever that means) by the same man who directed the film that started it all, it saddens me. The Orphanage, to give it its English title, comes across as one long procession; grinding us through scenes set in big 'spooky' houses with kids that see things that perhaps aren't really there as everyone runs around trying to find 'the truth'. Primarily the film borrows too much from Pan's Labyrinth and 2001 Alejandro Amenábar film The Others, another film with a dark look about a woman stuck in a large old house trying to figure out why her kids can see things she can't.Like Pan's Labyrinth and The Others, The Orphanage places its child character in a situation that threatens them physically. In The Others, the kids had an illness that would see them react harmfully to sunlight whereas in Pan's Labyrinth, the protagonist was under constant threat from the war around her and was placed in a number of 'imaginary' situations that could've caused her harm. Here, young boy Simón (Príncep) is HIV positive and it acts as his psychical 'scar' if you like, following an adoption by couple Carlos (Cayo) and Laura (Rueda).Then the film has the audacity to take one of the most effective scenes from The Others and recycle it for its own gain. I may not have liked The Others as much as everyone else did but my favourite scene from that film was when Kidman's character came across her daughter's drawings of her imaginary friends. This worked brilliantly because Kidman, as do the audience, sees what we're all supposed to be wary or afraid of through a child's sketch which is of course filtered through its own memory anyway. We got this rather than an out and out shot of one of them or a glimpse of one of them which would have acted as a gimmicky 'jump' scene. In The Others, we are given a crayon drawing we must take in, absorb and think about  it was chilling and quite effective. The Orphanage pillages this scene by having Simón draw a young kid wearing that ridiculous mask that's on all the promotional posters and the cover of the film anyway. It's not spooky and it's not effective and if any of us have memories that go back beyond seven years then it's not clever either.So if the film is a bit of a rip off, is it as enjoyable anyway on its own merit? Well, not really. After a bit of chin scratching; head scratching and behind the scenes bank balance checking, the film peels off and becomes a story told purely from Laura's point of view following a scene in which she (as do we) catches a glimpse of one of Simón's 'friends'. From here, The Orphanage banks on the old psychological horror trick; the 'am I going crazy?' routine and what follows is a series of scenes dedicated to finding clues, running about the house and gardens and pulling dramatic faces while panting once or twice all during which the audience must endure necessary set ups and non-existent payoffs.It's easy to knock a film for its logic if you look hard enough but on this occasion it's worth asking would Laura really be left alone in the house if people were aware of her possible fragile mental state? I doubt it. She'd already assumed to have spotted people she's supposedly seen before in the street and she admits to seeing someone else who wasn't really there one time on a beach so would it be right to leave her home alone? Probably not. The Orphanage has some interesting ideas even if they're borrowed and one scene much nearer the end that revolves around a game in which you look away and try to catch people sneaking up on you is effective enough to make you shuffle in your seat but I hope too many people aren't fooled by this copycat horror film in the long run.",5,6,11,10 October 2008
"I, Robot"," Fun and action-packed but it's also engaging and smart.
","Although released during the summer and being sold under a headline of CGI, stunts and action when it came out  I still didn't get that guilty pleasure; relaxed feeling you're perhaps supposed to get when watching a blockbuster and this is one of a few things that make I, Robot a thoroughly enjoyable film.I've read in some places that this film is perhaps a 'poor man's Blade Runner' but let me tell you something: as much as I thought Blade Runner was a pretty average film that relies on its crossing of genres to help it withstand the test of time, you have to admit to the similarities although in my opinion; I, Robot is just a little bit better. I think I, Robot has a touch of the 'noir' tone. The protagonist of the film is a detective, he's smart and fast talking; brushing people off with one-liners as he goes about his business. He has also suffered in the past  a tragedy we catch glimpses of in his horrible dreams and one that is unravelled in a pleasing way. I, Robot also manages to tie in this noir tone with other conventions that just make a film 'fun'.I liked the way we learn more and more about our hero Del Spooner (Smith) as he either reveals it to other characters or they state it as a matter of fact. We first discover he's an officer of the law after he chases down a robot whom appears to have snatched a handbag but we also discover things about the world in which the film is set (Chicago 2035) as adverts amongst other things tell us the role and importance of robots in this world.Early on, the character of Spooner is also depicted as one whom no one believes. He has a grudge against the robots but we do not know the motivation behind this grudge at the time. Due to this feeling, everyone doubts Spooner's ability to judge as well as his own sanity and because we do not know the facts; the audience themselves are put in a position that makes them doubt whether this hero is up to the task.As I, Robot unravels; we get deeper and deeper into a supposed murder investigation whilst at the same time clues are being solved and the truth is becoming clearer. This then spawns one or two interesting chase scenes or action set pieces including one set on a highway and involving multiple aggressive robots and a sequence in which Spooner is, quite literally: the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. The film also dabs in and out of a second story taking place revolving around a robot character called Sonny (who thinks and acts so much like a human being he could be counted as one) and his apparent guilty imprisonment under watchful eye of acting parole officer/doctor/lab technician Susan Calvin. Whilst all this takes place, I got a genuine feeling that the film was building to something.I, Robot is a better and smarter film than you would think. Although it seems to favour its product placement of 'JVC' and 'Audi' whilst, literally, blocking out that of 'Fed-Ex', the film doesn't have that many flaws or things that stick out and irritate you. The final sequence reminded me of a cross between Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines but also Resident Evil with a pinch of The Matrix, stunt-wise but this doesn't detract too much as everything preceding this has done its job to entertain us and make us care thus making I, Robot a very enjoyable sci-fi, detective film that turns a little dark half way through but maintains an enjoyable, action packed atmosphere until the end.",7,1,2,16 June 2007
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Still one of the best action films ever made, with fantastic levels of entertainment but careful and chilling substance as well.
","On face value, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a gripping and rip-roaring chase film constructed, in an entertainment sense, around three scenes of great action and tension that rely on the element of chase as their respective drives. Those scenes take place in Los Angles' flood control system between a motorcycle, a truck and a second motorcycle; an escape from a mental institution which primarily takes place on foot within the dark and precise confines of bleak, colourless corridors before branching out into an individual chasing a car load of protagonists; before finally settling for what is arguably the best of the three: a thrilling chase on a public highway between a SWAT van and a pursuing helicopter. This scene itself pauses to transform one involving a tanker truck chasing a much slower, smaller van. But the film is also a chilling warning, a film that borders on the political as it outlines the positive and negative aspects of modernity.While Terminator 2 has and will probably continue to wow audiences with its fast pacing, gripping chase scenes and general all round entertainment aesthetic; Cameron has crafted something that carries great substance, something that is lost on more contemporary action directors. When films are made nowadays about robots bashing the life out of each other, people like Michael Bay can only come up with things like Transformers but back in the day, a certain guile or craft; a certain thought process was the result of it.The film revolves around the statement that 'the future is not set', clearly stating that what we make up our own future as we go along and in the ever changing world of consumerism and modernity in which we live, there are no bounds as to where we can reach. The film was produced and released in 1991, coinciding with the end of The Cold War during which nuclear war was averted. The film's closing voice-over from a certain character is a warning of sorts; a statement that just because we've averted nuclear war in the most desperate of situations (echoing the character's actions in the film with the overall global situation), doesn't mean that there can never be a conflict as intense or as dangerous ever again. The closing voice-over makes reference to a 'new future', a future in which they hope technology and modernity is controlled and observed and that arms races' no longer exist.The film is of course about two robots sent back from 2029, one with a murderous agenda and the other with a more protective one. The target is John Connor (Furlong), whose mother Sarah (Hamilton) was the target in the first film. The pitch here is that a young boy is now the target rather than a mature woman, creating a sense of urgency or desperation before anything has even happened when we realise this new target really is a complete innocent and utterly helpless if he were to come across either of these machines. Meanwhile, Sarah is being treated as mentally ill in a local institute for the delusional.One of these machines acts as technology used 'for good' as it becomes apparent it is designed to protect John. This acts as the core of Sarah's argument when one of the more humbling scenes of realisation takes place in the desert half way through the film as she watches the machine interact with John. She states it was better than any (human) father in this regard and would fight and die protecting her son. While initially hostile towards the machine, wanting to destroy it at first chance, Sarah realises that machines are able to have a place in the world and she acknowledges the fact modernity exists and can be used for 'good' rather than to hasten H-bomb construction procedure or, indeed, to prolong nuclear war.But Cameron's crowning glory could well be the way that, despite the 'cinema as a spectacle' approach and despite all these studies of the advancement of technology and the warnings they carry, is the manner in which Cameron develops his characters. The first Terminator film was progressive enough; taking Sarah Connor from a passive, submissive waitress whom drives to work on a quaint little moped to killer robot killer but here, the development continues and progresses Sarah into this strong, hard bodied and very independent women â€“ a fighter, a soldier but still a mother. Effortlessly, on the other side of the coin, Cameron studies the fatherly relationship between John and the protective Terminator, fleshing him out to become more human. One key part of this, I feel, is the shedding of the sunglasses thus ridding a very artificial and anonymous characteristic of the Terminator's face and allowing the study to occur following this. Additionally, Sarah becomes more of a killing machine herself during these segments, much to her regret when she realises she's become the one thing she once feared and fled from not so long ago.Terminator 2 is Cameron's crowning glory. The first one was impressive enough given how much it took on with such limited resources, but here Cameron blitzes his previous effort, albeit the first one was still thoroughly impressive. This film was a reminder that, as we stood on the brink of the 21st century, this 'thing' called technology existed and could well be used for good, or for evil as wonderfully demonstrated in this film.",10,2,3,23 March 2009
Apocalypse Now," A 'road movie' war film that incorporates just about everything you'd want in both genres and much more.
","Apocalypse Now is a great film full of great things. People compare it to Saving Private Ryan as the best war film of all time and although I probably prefer Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now is still up there amongst it. A reoccurring quote from Apocalypse Now towards its dramatic concluding twenty minutes is 'the horror' and what a great thematic quote to use, not only as the film's tagline but also as a statement to sum up what goes on in Apocalypse Now and to sum up the Vietnam War in general. Apocalypse Now has a theme already and thus; scores points with me before it's even begun.Apocalypse Now is just full of the basics done brilliantly. The cinematography, the mise-en-scene, the atmosphere, the voiceovers powered by the screenplay  they all combine in pretty much every scene and deliver on such a level, it's so very difficult not to like. It truly sucks you into the film and into Vietnam. What the backbone of Apocalypse Now is that makes it so great is that its story is that of a single line journey; Apocalypse Now is a war based 'road movie' since it takes place down one stretch of track (a river) and involves the protagonist Benjamin Willard (Sheen) and his 'crew' getting into all sorts of conflict and adventures which is something that these sorts of films have that I just love.When people think of Vietnam films, they think of the jungle and jungle warfare. Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and We Were Soldiers are all acclaimed in their own right but Apocalypse Now moves away from the jungle in a way that feels so refreshing and new, it makes for fantastic viewing. There is so much to read out of this film, it's incredible. The first 'taste' of warfare we get is presented to us much like it is in Saving Private Ryan although it doesn't come as soon: it's presented in a state of absolute chaos. We have several choppers flying along, music blaring out, cut to the village they're about to attack: calm and peaceful until the American's arrive: more chaos, shouting, gunfire, orders being passed down, destroyed buildings bridges and cars as well as distressed villagers. What makes them even greater then what they actually start out as is when the American's actually start to struggle in their fight as a chopper is destroyed and someone is brutally injured in the fire fight. Epic, truly epic and a fantastic introduction to the warfare to expect.The journey not only of discovery but of self discovery Willard undergoes in fascinating in its own right. The numerous incidences involving things like: the supply boat they search, the bridge checkpoint they reach and the trench encounter as well as the ambush from the jungle they suffer and the scene after that when someone is lying there dead whilst a tape from home plays over a shot of their corpse  it's all ingenious film-making. One such scene I loved was following the girlie show the Americans have that descends into chaos, Willard states that the Vietcong's idea of nightly entertainment probably consists of 'a bowl of rice and something nice and simple'. I feel this is a statement of how something that should have gone so straightforward (a girlie show and the winning of the Vietnam war) can quickly get really out of hand and thus, turn into a mess.If there is a criticism, then it occurs during the final act of Apocalypse Now. The film goes from a war film with a mission and a plan to a much darker, more disturbing display of a character gone mad (Kurtz  Brando) in a dystopia full of strange characters, disorientating settings and a cow getting hacked up but this is in no way a major criticism. The film does slow down slightly when Willard is caged and spoken to through the character of a photojournalist (Hopper) and Kurtz just seems to be on the brink of a philosophical breakthrough one minute but spouting rubbish the next in almost all of his scenes. The payoff, however, as the mission reaches its climax is superb.There's no doubt that I really enjoyed Apocalypse Now and although Kramer vs. Kramer is still great; how this and Saving Private Ryan lost out on the best picture awards in their respective years is still beyond me.",10,0,1,22 August 2007
The Patriot," An uneasy combination of its director probably producing their best work; its lead firing on all cylinders and this strange sense of having seen it all before.
","One could be right in saying that the crossover period between 1999 and 2000 Mel Gibson spent in front of the camera was epitomised by all of: the desire for revenge; the need to challenge a ruling patriarchy and the ill-witting stumbling into a situation wherein encouraging people to stand up and believe in a burning desire for liberation is key to his presence. In Brian Helegeland's 1999 remake of Point Blank, entitled Payback, Gibson played out the role of angered lowlife striving for a bloody revenge on a man who wronged him before further still taking on a dominant ruling force and finding love where he didn't expect it. In Nick Park's Aardman clay figurine driven animation Chicken Run, he voices a rooster who quite literally crash lands into a chicken farm and whose desire to be free of the restraints of the scattered coops did not match their owners lust for them to produce eggs. It was here Gibson's character, through one means or another, became an idolised beacon of hope prefigured by those in desperate need of leadership. Where both films clock in at about a hundred odd minutes in length and get the job done, Roland Emmerich's The Patriot just doesn't quite make the grade. It isn't as much fun and nor is it about as substantial, in spite of the fact it is the length of both these movies put together and allows for its lead (Gibson) to wade through similar content.For sure, the film is that of Gibson's - in spite of the fact a handful of characters not limited to that of his eldest son Gabriel (Ledger) and a true to life British General named Cornwallis (Wilkinson), often strike us as going through plights that are more interesting. The project will eventually come to form one of those often tired circular journeys which begin on the homely sanctuary of a farm before ending on one after all the chaos; skirting with an enemy and experiencing life and such has played out. Along the way, the lead will be faced with the opportunity to bury the grief he has for a deceased spouse as well as discover the chance to rid himself of the post-traumatic stress disorder he has carried with him when specific wartime acts many-a year ago left him in startled awe at what he was capable of on a battlefield. The film has been branded as being about the dangers of pacifism, and it is a credit to the makers for addressing the crux of such a matter without indeed glorifying warfare.The lead is Benjamin Martin, a widower, and he lives on a South Carolina plantation in 1776 where the African Americans are paid; his youngest kids run through corn fields with warm smiles on their faces and the maid bakes pies for supper (although mercifully, she does not leave them on the sill to cool). Trouble is brewing, and war with the English (only later referred to as 'the British') over control of these East Coast states not limited to New York and Massachusetts is desired by most of the local council. Martin, troubled by what he experienced himself in the Franco-Indian wars, rejects the idea but is largely ignored when a crucial vote passes. Through one thing or another, he is dragged into the conflict when it quite literally arrives on his front door step and his family is befallen a tragedy; a tragedy instigated by a snarling villainous British Colonel named Tavington (Isaacs), who kills one of his sons and burns down the farm.From here, Emmerich launches the piece into a post-Last of the Mohicans; sub-Braveheart (with splashes of Saving Private Ryan on account of the Robert Rodat screen writing credit) wartime thriller as that of the British Empire crush the American infantry before tables are turned through the sole help of Martin and his guerrilla troops with whom he had previously fought. Along the way, Emmerich will, in equal measure, stall as well as kick things on; there is a lull to proceedings for about forty minutes as the second act tries to kick in and we await formal hostilities between that of Martin and Tavington to start, whereas attempts to touch on issues resembling that of Civil rights are more-so dolloped than subtly slid into proceedings to prop up the primary focus.There are things about the film one is able to admire, it provides us with a likable hero; a nasty antagonist and a number of supporting acts whose respective tales of romance and war time strife do well to just about justify the runtime. Emmerich resists depicting comically inclined British bad guys going up against brave, heart-on-the-sleeve Americans and allows for antagonism to transpire in both camps. Alas, it is an admirable failure. Granted, it falls into being one of those war films wherein the two key people, who are required to fight, are able to spot one another during the climactic battle wherein chaos and killing is all around them whilst they stand still and immune, but you go with it. The result is something fairly pedestrian, but not without merit.",5,2,4,21 November 2012
Van Helsing," Universal Horror for Dummies.
","It would seem that when Kate Beckinsale is taking time out from fighting vampires and werewolves in an Underworld film, she's...........fighting vampires and werewolves in a Van Helsing film. In fact, that pretty much sums up not only four years of Kate's career but also the film of Van Helsing as a whole  a film that makes numerous mistakes yet makes up for it in the form of feel good, guilty action; a film that is loud and brave yet is incidental and one tracked. Director Stephen Sommers successfully re-invented another Karloff classic in 1999 by name of The Mummy; this was followed by a fun but not as good sequel called The Mummy Returns and then by a real piece of entertainment/trash called The Scorpion King. Right at the very beginning though, Sommers himself played a directorial version of Dr. Frankenstein and meshed together two 1970s action films called Alien and The Poseidon Adventure to create Deep Rising  another one of his failures. This final example is rather relevant to Van Helsing since it's a re-invention of Universal's classical era monsters.A lot of the content in Van Helsing just feels copied, either from an older horror film or something else. The opening scene is rather insulting to the 1930s Frankenstein films, the scene in which Van Helsing (Jackman) is introduced to the gadgets and his overall mission is reminiscent of a James Bond 'Q' and 'M' scene and the whole film in general just feels like a cross between 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'Shrek'. I feel sorry for the people who hadn't seen any Universal horror films before they saw this. I really enjoyed Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein from the 1930s  even Branagh's 1994 version was outgoing and experimental (although it just 'felt' poorly made in the end) but Van Helsing as a film is just a dumbed down version of a would be franchise waiting to be re-injected at a time of big budget, CGI fun-fests. Yes, I 'got' the references to previous films: when The Monster states 'Friend!' and when the 'It's Alive' quote is muttered at the very beginning but the film is so dumbed down, we need to be 'reminded' that Vampires don't like sunlight; that Werewolves need to be killed with silver bullets and that the full moon transforms them  no doubt newcomers to these villains will be in awe: 'Wow! That's a really cool  they thought of everything.' True, only these are 70 year old concepts you're gushing at.The film also suffers from within in the form of blatant mistakes and a poorly structured narrative. First, the character of The Monster is more reminiscent to that of an opera singer given the way he is almost singing his lines like a tenor rather than mumbling through the film in true 'body parts made form dead men and the mind of a murderer' fashion. Also, during one scene Anna (Beckinsale) jumps off a walkway onto a rope above a boiling pot of chemicals when two enemies are coming for her: why the hell does she do this? The two foot soldiers are small and beatable yet she does the tricky thing and jumps onto a rope. She ends up defeating them on the rope anyway but it seemed a pointless excuse for an action scene of some sort. Secondly; after a carriage chase through the woods at night, the very next scene is daylight as one character consoles another on the ground yet the flying woman/vampire bat is exposed to it on the cliff-edge. The fact the film switches from night to day so quickly AND has the vampire in the daylight is laughable. Again, a poor excuse for an action scene of some sort and the scene where the sidekick solves everything towards the end in about a minute was ridiculous.Van Helsing is really just a film for the people who missed the first Universal horror franchise and if they do decide to track down the 1930s and beyond films then they'll probably be disappointed with them which in a way is sad and unfortunate. The effects are good and the fight scenes entertaining in a way but it's nothing more than a Deep Rising of Universal Horror.",5,1,1,30 September 2007
Rocky IV," 'Checkmate, friend'
","What used to be a series of films about boxers has become a franchise almost exclusively about boxing. Where the focus was once on people, the focus is now on the mashing up of people; where once it was interesting, it has, by the point of Rocky IV, become extremely uninteresting. One of the easiest pieces of criticism in the world is to cite 1976's Rocky as better than most of its sequels, but there was a film about people wandering around; talking; falling in love and ambling through unremitting times. Now, we witness all that shelved for aggressive caricatures and crass causality which underpin a really unbalanced air of smug nationalism. Throw in a tacked on message at the very end, in spite of all that precedes it, about how sport brings everyone together (regardless of nationality, political belief or otherwise) anyway and you have a badly judged; poorly thought through mess of a sports film that does few people many favours.Sylvester Stallone is the eponymous Rocky Balboa, a man with countless opponents already vanquished and a heavy number of victories already under his belt. As is the case with the beginnings of most of these sequels, we're introduced to Rocky as a man living the ideal life amidst the big-time; he's got the latest sports cars, a fantastic domestic set up, complete with wife and kid, and is the world champion again. He even finds room to encompass into his world the latest in modernity in the form of a curious, automated robot butler such is the depth of his personal wealth. Where time has passed; infants have grown and money expanded, so too have the years on Balboa – careers in boxing do not last long, and Rocky has been around the block enough times to lose big bouts; come back and win rematches, before further succumbing only to successfully garner the fame once again. This fuss arrives when a Russian amateur named Ivan Drago (Lundgren) arrives in The States to test themselves against what the Americans have to offer. Drago is a quiet, seemingly shy, boxer who's well built and shepherded around by his entourage, of whom appear just as friendly as they do ignorant of their surroundings and American's boxing depth. Apollo Creed, one time foe turned mutual accomplice out of the bouts and respect Rocky and he have for one another, is around, but is long past fighting in spite of still possessing the itch to do so. With Drago's arrival, and Creed's eagerness, the pair match up in a fight Creed reckons will be easier than everyone thinks given this young opponent is foreign; not professional and just generally a bit of alien to things. Creed's gaze, as he watches Drago on the television on the evening's news, besots him with the idea of getting back into the ring – his observation of Drago as this young, unknown amateur seemingly ripe for the taking carries with it an odd dynamic of homoeroticism at the thought of once again implementing power upon someone inferior to him.Disaster strikes when, under dramatic circumstances, the Soviet boxer upsets all odds and wins the fight: killing our Creed in the process; an instance that hits Rocky hard and throws his domestic bliss into turmoil when he's determined to get back in there and take the fight to Drago in honour of Creed. Overlying the drama is the tension born out of the fact Balboa and Creed were always at similar stages in their boxing career, and a mere exhibition fight against an eccentric wrestler earlier was enough of a challenge in itself. Thus, Rocky's own proposed idea of going up against this now indomitable force from the East is fraught with madness and danger, and is very much the plan of action wife Adrian (Shire) goes against. Regardless, Balboa gets it into his head he must for sake of retribution on account of his dear friend Creed while certain others get it into their heads that Rocky must win on account of resorting national pride. So much for him being the 'Italian' Stallion.The bad news is that a great deal of it is nonsense and the film on the whole is just a bit rubbish. The Russians are cartoonish and underdeveloped; their inclusion, in a political and propagandist sense, clumsy and ill-judged; the idea to change the nationality of the opponent this time around sussed by the dissatisfied audience fairly quickly in that it's essentially a ploy to disguise the fact you're watching the same sequel a third time. Very little works, although I quite liked Brigitte Nielsen's inclusion as this prim, photogenic dominatrix-type who does all of Drago's talking for him at the press conferences as he obediently sits beside her. Though what is truly bizarre, is the way the film depicts the obligatory training montages of the two fighters nearer the fight. If I told you one of them has access to all the technology and computers they could wish for, while the other has only a small shack in the middle of snowy nowhere; that one of them goes overtime on a running machine, whereas the other scales hills and mountains for their exercise; that one uses stretching pulleys to maintain muscle, while the other chops firewood with an axe, which boxer would you think underwent one training regime and which would you think underwent the other? This is, I'm afraid, as fresh as it gets.",4,1,4,28 March 2013
In the Name of the Father," Excellent character study of a man wrongfully imprisoned and further forced to balance finding justice with finding solace with his father.
","In the Name of the Father is an epic tale of hope and mistaken identity, a towering achievement of sorts focusing on everyday and very likable central characters as they are put through an awful emotional grinder based on true events from the 1970s and 80s. The film is spoilt only very slightly by a quite woeful theme song from Irish band U2 and the fact director Jim Sheridan cannot much direct action, forcing the very early few scenes to come across as awkward and misjudged. The rest, however, is a dedicated study of a dedicated man forced into becoming a hate figure; a fall guy of sorts, as the British government struggle to come up with answers regarding the ongoing struggles in the conflict with the Irish Republican Army.The film is a tale of fighting for justice, a tale of independence and the duty one must go through in order to attain that independence. The road is long and the times get desperate; the characters face long stretches of prison time for things they did not do – years were incorrectly taken off their lives and the result of it all is condensed down into a two and a bit hour film that you can most certainly go out of your way to see. What is two hours of your time compared to thirty odd years of someone else's, after all?The film is essentially told in a flashback perspective, a story that is distilled through lawyer Gareth Peirce's (Thompson) imagination as she envisages the lead character doing what he does as he narrates to her exactly what went down through a cassette recording. But we are there as well, we are back in the 1970s and 80s with the lead character as they lead a relatively upbeat and happy-go-lucky life initially before the tragedy strikes. The lead is Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis), a young Northern Irishman from Belfast who is living a life surrounded by IRA-led activity in the 1970s without ever directly being involved, but he is the sort of guy who gets caught in the cross-fire; a sort of 'wrong place, wrong time' scenario-led life that will catch up with him in horrific ways later on. When we first see Gerry, the likable rouge attitude and relatively odd choice of song by way of Jimi Hendrix sees him get chased by British troops that mistake him for an IRA sniper – the scene has a fair amount of 'fun' to it; something that is brought back down to Earth later on.There is a sad irony and that is that it is proposed Gerry should move away from Northern Ireland following these scenes in order to get away from the troubles. Gerry agrees and takes a boat over to England with a friend named Paul Hill (Lynch), before briefly settling down in London. Initially, the film plays on Gerry being a bit of a misfit in this new setting; he mixes mostly with casual drug takers, hippies and devout, air headed female vegetarians. This unconnected and grounded realism driven segment in the film is impressive and mysterious. Having no knowledge of who these people are and what eventually happens to them will have you see the film as this wandering and series of supposedly random events in a specific time setting as Gerry wanders the streets; talks to tramps, thieves from the homes of those that accidentally drop their keys right outside the front door and looks for short stay accommodation here and there.But what follows is a change in gear and a change in study, indeed a change that encompasses desperation; mistaken identity; the hunt for redemption and the forcing of confronting issues regarding the relationship with one's father. A bomb is detonated within the vicinity of Gerry's general area one night and he is singled out by the police for his Irish roots and the fact he has only very recently arrived in England. He is jailed, with his father, as a part of the 'Maguire Seven', before desperately trying to claim justice. As a lead character, Gerry later embodies all the innocent and necessary traits for a victim just trying to survive. The film's point of attack takes special care in painting a wavy image for Gerry, one that sees him rob apartments of money, joke about with his mates and come across as quite antagonistic at times.Gerry and his father's, named Giuseppe (Postlethwaite), coming together in prison provide some of the more fascinating scenes in the film; a forced period of bonding during which they humblingly make peace and mend the past problems that they shared from years gone by. There is enough in the film to get caught up in, a sense of tragedy and mis-justice; a sense of pain and desperation. As far as prison set dramas go, this is one of the more impressive I've seen.",8,1,2,28 May 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Generally well reigned in and free of any really nasty; the film can be episodic and often staggers around, but it is a dizzy black comedy I generally took to.
","The film begins with a male character, of whom we have to presume is of a rather informed ilk given the certificates and qualifications draped over his office walls, doing something we conclude to be rather stupid. Staring intensely at a wall opposite him, focusing on it as if his life depended on it, the individual takes a running charge before meeting the stretch of plaster and mortar head on and rebounding backwards - landing painfully on his back. Thus begins the commonplace tone of the film; that is to say, its following of somewhat informed people, with very specific experiences in life, shambling their way into situations that were always going to get a lot worse before they got any better following a string of misguided conscientious decisions.For the most part, The Men Who Stare at Goats covers a certain Bob Wilton, played by Ewan McGregor; a journalist based in the state of Michigan who voluntarily ends up in The Middle East when a longtime female partner leaves him for a three-limed wielding combat veteran of whom, in her estimation, is the better catch. His escape from this arrives in the venturing to the nation of Kuwait, wherein he will meet up with a man in the form of Lyn Cassady (Clooney) – a man initially dismissed as a bit of a kook, but a man Wilton decides to stick things out with when it transpires he has a back-story to do with certain lost divisions of the American Army. Wilton, angry out of the collapse of his partnership with a woman that left him for a man who fought for his country and experienced warfare to the degree that he did, appears to do what he does in The Middle East out of an immense feeling of inferiority. What Wilton uncovers is the fact that Cassady was more involved in a department built on both the research and practise of people eliminating others via the power they wield in their minds - a sort of murderous telepathy designed to strike down the enemy without even raising a finger.Initially dismissing the idea as nonsense, the film covers Wilton's inception into Cassady's world of psychological warfare and illicit mind-tricks apparently capable of dropping an enemy on the strength of concentration and mental verve. Needless to say, it is Wilton's film wherein we may see him uncover the makeshift reality of the situation Cassady talks about, and this is in spite of the fact Clooney and his character steal the show as both a foil and as something allowing Wilton to put aside his marital issues and get involved in something genuinely engaging aside from faux-quests of masculinity. The film covers the pair of them hitting the road so as to travel to Iraq - something which will lead them closer to, amongst other things, those of whom Cassady speaks that were always more broadly linked to the mind control division; the film mutating into a buddy comedy road movie of sorts, the juxtaposition of falling back onto something as familiar and as carefree as such whilst delivering this wild premise working to decent success.During the trip, Cassady's back-story involving a spaced out Jeff Bridges character and this meeting through a bit of an episode in the Vietnam War is told parallel with the present trek; a bumping into an American contractor sees Robert Patrick do his best in reenacting that of what Ben Kingsley pulled off in the recent, and similarly toned, 2008 film 'War Inc.', as this brash and seemingly spoof all-powerful; all-conquering optimisation of America's attitude on foreign affairs. The film is about a story which is ultimately, and away from the offbeat nature of it as well as the quirksome nature of what transpires throughout, tragic and doom-laden.There is an eventual sense of immense sadness as to how these men linked to this specific American Army division come to just observe their lives capitulate around them. Yet the director, a certain Grant Heslov and here treading a very fine line very well, has the guts to construct certain things about these happenings as quite funny; as if we might find it amusing. The film just about gets away with it, primarily out of the fact these men and their world is explored from the perspective of an outsider raw to what those therein have been involved in all this time – the film is an amusing comedy but a sad film depicting weary people with beliefs they've held on to for years beginning to fall apart before their very eyes. We enjoy certain episodes within and the odd couple pairing of the journalist with the soldier; the masculinity indulging, looking for warfare Wilton with the ultimately pacifist Cassady – itself a pairing amusingly subverting what we might typically expect of a respective Clooney and McGregor role. On other occasions, it falls over its feet when a kidnap sequence on account of some insurgents feels trivialised when flashbacks to the wacky past quench the horror of the present situation, but flaws aside, and there are rather-a few, the film treads water enough for it to make the grade.",6,0,3,5 December 2011
Jarhead," Intermittedly interesting look at the calm before no-storm-at-all in Gulf War One, which weeps more for the loss of oil than the loss of life amidst many other frustrations.
","Poor Jake Gyllenhaal is in the desert and going mad in Jarhead. There are no Arabs to shoot and no girlfriend around to penetrate over the course of the long, hot and dusty tour he's doing over there during Gulf War One in Sam Mendes' 2006 film. What is Jarhead other than a slightly annoying film about rather annoying people itching to engage in warfare and spend their time indulging in frat-boy infused humour? The film is a dead zone if you came looking for an interesting look at what it was like fighting on the frontline of The First Gulf War, the air of relief acting as a faux smoke screen over the sense of frustration towards the end when the troops realise the war is over and some of them never even got to fire their weapon; never even got to feel the manly sensation of having killed someone. So much so that the film needs to rely on a veteran of the Vietnam War to join them on a parade vehicle once they're back home so as to raise our awareness, or remind us, of what war is actually like when it becomes obvious the last hour and a half may have been a little tough, but guys in the U.S. Marines have had it far worse in the past.Jarhead's a bit like that, scattered and unfocused in tone and overall attitudes to its subject matter; as if Mendes himself, a director I like a lot, identified how lacklustre the source material really is and tried to tiptoe around that fact. The film is unashamed in its calling to mind past items so as to tell us what war was REALLY like; its imagery persistently calling to mind past war films of old in the clearing out of the squad toilets alá Platoon; the clear referencing to Full Metal Jacket in the boot camp training sequences and the generality of how that is structured along with the frontline action; the oral referencing to Apocalypse Now in the Ride of the Valkyries music the troops boom out of their speakers and the worst instance of which sees the opening few seconds of 1978's The Deer Hunter begin playing on a television, before inexplicably cutting to a homemade pornography movie of one of the squadies' partners with a neighbour. Such is the film's attitude to its study: the worry about what's happening back home and the instabilities of these people's home-life over the difficulties and harsh realities of wartime service. For a better film about the stagnant perspective of conflict, check out 2007 Israeli film Beaufort. Gyllenhaal is indeed the lead, a certain Anthony Swofford who is in a sniper regiment in The Gulf, and being a sniper, the film has an excuse to shoot everything down his scope, so he's able to 'look' at everything through it and there's that sense he's 'looking' through his scope and 'observing' everything around him first hand in a first person perspective. Swofford has very few decent memories of life; a troubled childhood and not an awful lot going on in the early years of his life, he sees the Marines as a sort of second chance or re-birthing into another life or world. His raw and relatively unflinching introduction to this life is by way of a dopey slow motion christening, the spreading of dirt and grime over his forehead and facial area as he informs us his combat experience 'has begun'.Jarhead initially looks through pro-war tints at the idea of war and the prospect of warfare, by the end I think most of the troops are still the same. War's treated as if it's something to look forward to in regards to these people with their 'go get 'em' attitude accompanying a generally upbeat, pacey aesthetic the piece carries. By the end, it turns out to be something that came very close to happening but, annoyingly for them, didn't quite materialise: it's there; it comes (to a degree) and then it goes – so what? By the time the boot-camp sequences are over, Jarhead slots down into a groove of waiting and stewing; the troops forever angry at the lack of action and women as well as the painstaking attempts to relieve boredom by strenuous routines of having to clean one's rifle amidst other menial events they didn't travel there to do. The problem here that the film makes its points very quickly, Jarhead being one of those rare war films that asks for pity from the audience for its characters without any of them ever really having faced any warfare. How would those that liked it have taken to a piece similar to this that revolved around young troops, American or otherwise, about to embark on the D-Day campaign? What about a WW2 film set on the Eastern front about young trigger-happy, pro-war Russian troops about to siege a German stronghold to a bumpy, upbeat aesthetic with sprinklings of crass comedy before ending as the siege begins? We'd feel a little robbed, like we'd spent 'x' amount of time with unpleasant people and then it ended. Maybe WW2 is too much of a taboo, but clearly there's no problem in documenting tours served in Gulf War One in this manner. Whatever the reason, the film is a celebration of soldier machismo and resilience in a location the film goes to painstaking lengths to paint as really hostile and tough. At the end of The Thin Red Line; Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, we are asked to weep for men young and old whose lives are forever changed in their experiences; at the end of Jarhead, we are supposed to feel for dumb-dumb in their attitudes Yank soldiers whose tours in the desert has instilled them with a faux sense of accomplishment and provides them with stories to tell that are infused with a pseudo sense of accomplishment, and it doesn't work.",5,1,1,16 May 2010
Collateral," So much more than just a two hour action film.
","The state in which the crime genre is in when it comes to modern day Hollywood is that of one teetering on a brink; but what that brink is, I don't exactly know. Long gone are the days of those voiced over film noirs with their sultry femme fatales trying to distract the detectives from their missions but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. You do get the odd throwback (I'm thinking Sin City) but nowadays; fast, pulsating films with recognisable Hollywood names that lighten up the screen seem to be the norm when thinking of the crime genre. In Collateral, we have a perfect example of a fast, flashy but with a relatively simplistic concept for a film all mixed up to produce an entertaining piece of film-making.I was appalled with Miami Vice; another modern day crime film made through the conventions described above and coincidentally, another Michael Mann film but here, Mann succeeds and this is through a number of things. First, there is an atmosphere. There is an awkward, unpredictable atmosphere that sucks us in. Second, Mann actually makes good use of the film's setting. Like Miami Vice, Mann uses a colourful yet seemingly deadly mass urban utopia as the setting only this time, it's captured perfectly on screen; something he also did in Heat. Here, the setting is used well; the film isn't confined to a taxi cab for two hours and whenever the character's are outside we are allowed to breath and take in our surroundings as the action continues; whether it's on top of a sky scraper in a race against time or a foot chase over a pedestrian bridge.What's also effective is the way the film manipulates its viewer; often, I'm sure, without them even realising. Tom Cruise plays a character called Vincent and to say he really, really sheds his skin is an understatement. Off the top pf my head, I can name the first two Mission Impossible films, Top Gun and The Colour of Money as Cruise films I can recall seeing. In Collateral, Cruise really opens up and shows us he's much more than we take him for. His character is something that not only plays games with Max (Foxx) but also with the audience. We're made to like Vincent: he's smart, he's sharp, he's just cool  too cool. What's more, he completes his first two hits without us even seeing him do it, meaning that we are not yet put off this cool cat as we haven't yet seen him kill any one. Max, on the other hand, is just playing a boring taxi driver. How are we meant to associate with him? This is clever as it turns on its head half way through and by the end, everything is completely upside down as the film has manipulated you into rooting for someone you thought was reasonably lame in comparison to this super-duper hit-man who can now be viewed as a bit of a psychopath. This is the first little clever thing Collateral does.The second is the feeling and overall theme. For a film to have a theme is great enough on its own. Some fantastic films over the years have had themes. Pulp Fiction's was redemption, 2001: A Space Odyssey's was evolution and Collateral's, from my reading, is circulation. Everything comes around and goes around every once in a while. Now and again taxi drivers pick up the wrong fare and Vincent's story half way through (that echoes at the end) about circulation as he rides off (so to speak) leaves a taste in the mouth that isn't quite bitter but isn't exactly sweet, either.Although with some rather ludicrous product placement very early on; Collateral is not only a popcorn-esqe thrill ride with chases and shootings; but also a more deeper, more sensual look at life as a whole. Combine this with clever film tricks and traits only good experienced directors can produce and you've got yourself a truly memorable film.",8,2,3,18 April 2007
The Machinist," An eerie and effective film that plays with the viewer and forces some working out.
","The Machinist is a film that displays evidence of numerous things. It proves that Christian Bale is a quality actor, although he'd already done that with American Psycho four years earlier; it proves that there are good films still being made every now and again in an era when sequels and remakes are bringing in most of the cash for the American film industry but it also proves that Spain doesn't need to rely on Almodóvar to make their films appeal to a wider audience.What's clever about The Machinist is its overall delivery of its subject matter. It's bleak, colourless, eerie and has a distinct slow atmosphere to it. This is put through via the way the character of Trevor Reznik (Bale) talks to other people, because he's tired and very thin, thus rendering him weak. He says he hasn't slept for a year but this may be untrue (as well as some other thing) as things become clearer later on. The film seems like it's a psychological horror as each scene is particularly ambiguous and un-nerving. We're being treated to eerie compositions of strange things but I was never quite sure if I was supposed to feel scared, uneasy or whether I was supposed to be looking out for clues of some sort. A good example can be the ghost train ride scene where a series of uncanny images are flashed at us and a child goes into a frothing fit. When you look back at this scene at the end, it was merely just a fun fair ride and there was nothing too sinister going on at all. A guy and a child goes on a ride and an unfortunate incident happens, nothing else.But what makes this film particularly effective is that it plays with the viewer. I think most people who see this are so sure that 'soon enough, something really bad will happen' thanks to the eerie atmosphere it has, that they trick themselves into thinking something has. Some iconography of this can be the refrigerator apparently leaking blood and the mysterious memo sticker appearing on a cupboard with a drawing of a stickman attached to a noose, ala 'Hangman' style. When you look at these two things, the leaking fridge can be explained logistically  there was a power-cut at his apartment and the fridge's power was cut off; thus the items of food inside were ruined and started to rot/leak a little. Anything else that raises questions can simply be brushed off using the old 'it was all in his head' trick. This includes the fact he supposedly murders someone in his flat, wraps up the body in a rug and goes to dump it off a pier but when he gets there, there's no body in the rug, and the guy he killed appears behind him as a coastguard on watch.The fact that Reznik also finds himself in delicate situations on numerous occasions, but seems to do the worst thing possible, is also a point of discussion. When someone looses an arm in some machinery at his factory, it's due to the fact he leans on the wrong button. When he goes round to apologise to someone about something, he rants about a supposed conspiracy against himself and gets thrown out. Also, when he accuses his prostitute friend's supposed ex-boyfriend of stalking him (when really he doesn't exist) he's only making things worse for himself as a certain photograph he found in the guys wallet is actually of him yet he can't see that even though it's right in front of him.Twinned with this, the people around him suffer a lot more than he does. I think he maps this suffering onto himself; thus taking the weight of other people's problems. Examples are: the prostitute who gets beaten up, the child that has an epileptic fit and the worker that looses his arm. These problems don't affect him at all yet he seems to take the brunt of them and each little thing adds to his delusion.It may sound like I was unimpressed with The Machinist, but this isn't the case. Any film that makes you think like this and, almost, demands a second viewing can hold its head up high along with other films such as Memento and Twelve Monkeys. The Machinist is a clever, well made and well thought out film that works on many levels as it tackles sensitive subjects such as insomnia, amnesia and mental illness.",8,2,2,20 April 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A healthy blend of fantasy and suspense in an easily manipulative world.
","With two Harry Potter films firmly under the belt and many other books, the phenomenon that is Harry Potter is easy to recognise and will stick with generations to come, but how does this film match up against two other reasonably successful films? Surely the curse of the sequel has to strike sooner or later. Not necessarily.Chris Columbus is something of an auteur when it comes to family films given the fact 'Home Alone' (1990) and 'Mrs. Doubtfire' (1993) are two easily recognisable films when it comes to the genre and the first two Harry Potter films were a healthy way in which to introduce the series. This third one takes it up a level.Oddly enough, the film starts rather blandly, almost randomly, and it takes a while to get to grips with the world of the film and in which the characters live in. This may be easier for others depending on your taste in film and knowledge of Harry Potter though. We're given a rather ridiculous and unfunny introduction to Harry Potter at home during the summer and the reminder of the cruel setting of which he lives. Everything here seems a little too forced and it's as if it's mandatory that we are told, once again, Harry isn't happy at home. It's unnecessary.Once the film gets going, we are thrown into the world of magic and of Hogwarts, the superb setting for the film. The fantasy element is amazing and it's easily to get lost in. This is clever as you need your brain active for this film in order to follow the plot's twists and the time travel element when they arrive but at the same time, there's no shame to just simply relax and let Hogwarts take you wherever and engross you with it's entertaining quips that it has. Some techniques that I'm a big fan of in this film is the one used really early on which sets up an uncomfortable feeling you have throughout the film. Here, the example is when our three heroes are on the train and dialogue is used to build up a disturbing and uncomfortable feeling for characters know as 'dementors'. This is done, as I said, early on in the film and sets the scene brilliantly as the threat of them is there throughout and we know what they're capable of and what a threat they are. The technique is also used with Sirius Black's character.Following on from this dialogue technique, the use of a rather disturbing and eerie scene so early on and so soon after the dialogue is another good way of making an effective film. We are told of the beings and then suddenly, we are confronted by one and we're left with the feeling if 'Hold on, this is too soon! I need more time to digest this stuff!' Clever film-making.This happens through out the film and the timing and placing of the horror, the fantasy and the comedy, which has a couple of reoccurring jokes, is very welcome and very well done. It makes the film so much more clean and well put together. There's also a very pleasant feeling of ambiguity flowing throughout up until round about the start of the last act which keeps everything very mysterious and suspenseful. This, along with my last point, keeps the film going beautifully.Apart from a bit of 'poker faced' acting from the heroes, nobody else puts a foot wrong in the acting department and one thing I didn't like was the confusing way in which suddenly everything is un ravelled following a plot turn. Although I'm alien to the book's content, it didn't work well for me and had to have it explained afterwards.Don't be put off seeing this film, as it is enjoyable with a nice blend of almost everything.",7,0,1,11 July 2006
The Lego Movie," Periodically funny, mostly innocent animation which bites off more than it can chew.
","'The Lego Movie' plays like a loud Sunday morning cartoon, but which just so happens to have the odd reference to an old movie or life situation an adult might be able to cotton on to thrown in for good measure. It is, like so many of those cartoons, an exhausting assault of colour; noise; movement and energy - experiencing it is, indeed, very much like sitting and watching two (or more) frenetic kids playing with a vast array of Lego paraphernalia - something which, it turns out, isn't too far away from what is actually happening anyway... Despite this, there is buried within 'The Lego Movie' somewhere the message that there is no substitute for creativity and imagination, which is admirable enough, yet rather ironically the film needed to be reigned in much more for it all to work. The story is also incredibly conventional, in its depiction of heroes; villains; mentors and love interests battling away in a place where a plot to end the world has been hatched. This wasn't something you could say about something like 'Toy Story', which decided to eschew some of these tropes; brought to life an alternate universe within our own and also depicted an impressive two-fold character study. Meanwhile, a better example of an animated post-modernist explosion which combined rapid pacing and cultural gentrification might be 2012's 'Wreck it Ralph'. American actor Chris Pratt voices Emmett, a lowly construction worker living in a city made entirely out of Lego that is run by President Business (Will Ferrell). Business is a crypto-fascist who controls the population with cheesy pop songs and awful television shows. It is, as Neil Postman once wrote, '...in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate.' So slavish to this situation are the inhabitants of Emmett's world that everybody 'greets' the world each morning as one. Emmett is ripped out of his world of subconscious conformity when, one day after work, he spots an intruder on the construction site and, upon confronting them, accidentally winds up deep underground prior to experiencing an out-of-body experience which renders him unconscious. Before he knows anything, he is eye-deep in a plot to do with Business' private Gestapo and the foiling of a prophecy once made by Business' sworn enemy Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) to do with how, one day, a hero will lead the people to victory over the world of orthodoxy and order. Narrative is perfunctory for most of the film; that is until, perhaps cleverly, it wraps its story into what is REALLY happening beyond the confines of the film's universe. 'The Lego Movie', for the most part, is too preoccupied with dragging you head first through a bush - then through another bush into the Wild West; then through another into a realm of knights and dragons before settling on something else entirely, but not before it has taken you to Cloud Cuckoo Land (don't ask) as Emmett and a collection of allies strive to defeat the bad guy. How one reacts to any of this will be dependent on one's tolerance threshold for sheer nonsense, but nonsense that is harmless fun and which does possess half a dozen genuine laughs (Vitruvius' secret knock, anyone?), while being helped along by the fact everything is made of Lego. Had it been something else other than Lego, such as 'regular' characters going about a 'regular' adventure, would anyone have really provided the film with much more than a passing grade? The makers of the film, Christopher Miller & Phil Lord, cover so much ground and flit from one to so many other places that they allow themselves licence to do anything and reference anything from any walk of life or genre. It isn't often you get Shaquille O'Neal joking about how the enemy were '...ready for that(!)' within minutes of Professor Dumbledore arguing with someone over the pronunciation of his name. This is actually fairly lazy, and is best epitomised when they take their characters to the aforementioned Cloud Cuckoo Land, which is, put literally, merely a locale of complete gibberish wherein anything goes. Rooted at the epicentre of the piece is a stiff, egalitarian message to do with how individualism and diversity must triumph over conformity and a refusal to accept amalgamation and hybridity, which is here depicted as pure evil. Again, how one reacts to the film will depend on your own outlooks in life - are pirates and soldiers best suited to battling one another on desert islands and across vast oceans? Or do they all need to come together with the astronauts; cowboys; spaceships; half the cast of 'Harry Potter' and Robin Hood to have one giant adventure for any of it to be enjoyable.Despite this, the film occasionally branches off for more admirable messages to do with self-confidence and thinking for oneself - using your imagination and being creative, best demonstrated in Vitruvius' line to Emmett that he must 'embrace what is special about you.' But more tantalising is the fact there are so many objects from OUR world in the villain's possession. And why do we hear a human boy remark 'it's your turn to be the hero...' as Emmett has his early out-of-body experience?By the time the film had ended the first time I saw it (I watched it twice), I had a headache. I was able to appreciate it a little more after the second viewing because I had a better idea of where the chaos was heading, but remain relatively dumb-founded as to why so much praise had been previously heaped on it. Many-a nice thing has been written and said about 'The Lego Movie', but it struck me as generally a bit of a mess.",5,1,1,17 April 2018
Aliens," Going bigger and slightly better, Cameron's 'Alien' sequel pulls off everything it attempts.
","There is a moment about half way through James Cameron's 'Aliens' which seems to very deliberately turn back to its 1979 predecessor and say 'yeah, I see your effort, and I raise you'. It occurs when a bevy of soldiers are trooping through the remains of a settlement on a desolate moon: it has been ransacked by a series of violent creatures whose sole purpose is to seemingly seek organisms and attack them. As they march through the crime scene, we realise that they are essentially traversing an area which has seen events play out that were very similar to the first film: a group of (largely) unarmed people trying to defend themselves from these animals in a zone they cannot escape. 'Aliens', however, is just getting out of second gear by this point...Cameron's film somehow manages to go bigger and, dare I say it, a bit better than 'Alien' - marrying the genres of action; horror and science-fiction to excellent effect. Indeed, like the best of anything science-fiction has to offer, you get the feeling you are in another world - a world of superior artificial intelligence, of space vehicles designed for things we are still a long way from pioneering ourselves and of distant worlds.The terror Cameron seems able to inject into proceedings stems, I think, from knowing there are multiple enemies; indeed, an endless supply, about whom we know very little but always seem to be conniving to get you one way or another. One would think lots of these creatures dumped into a film alongside a group of gun-toting protagonists would make for a disaster after the menacing calm of the first film - perhaps I once thought that myself, but having seen the film again recently, I'm of the opinion that Cameron executes the material really well.'Aliens' begins with a military-style drum roll over the opening credits, briefly foreshadowing the militaristic content this edition will possess. We pick up, quite literally, where the first film ended: the lone human survivor of the transport ship Nostromo, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), is drifting through space in an escape capsule. When she is found, a rare and amusing moment occurs: an outside agent, totally unaware of what they have stumbled upon, crack open the door and send in a probe to make sure it's safe - they are afraid of what we know is perfectly fine, and yet we as an audience are unsure of what has found our heroine and so are oddly uneasy as well.When Ripley comes around, the film allows us to share in her shock at the fact some 57 years have passed since the events of the first film. She has lost a daughter who has outlived her and, gut-wrenchingly, entire families have since settled on the moon the initial alien's biological origins were discovered. Her only friend amidst a sea of disapproving bureaucrats, unsympathetic to her story, is a smooth-talking company employee named Burke (Paul Riser), whose pleasant manner makes certain later reveals all that more surprising...Burke wants Ripley to traverse to the moon when, inexplicably, communications with the settlement suddenly cease, only he wants her to accompany a platoon of marines, as she has first-hand experience of the creature and nobody can take any chances... What Cameron does impressively here is he allows for the opening act to calmly break us into this sequel, which is at once both very similar to 'Alien' but very different: loose ends are tied up, Ripley becomes grounded again; we sneak a glimpse of mugshots of the first crew on a monitor; she accepts her daughter's death and even reconciles with the cat of the first film.Once Cameron senses we are ready to roll, act two arrives, and the film begins to play games: the marines themselves strike us as unprofessional in their messing around and cracking crude jokes. They are not especially well-drilled - one of them even seems to echo the dialogue of the doomed crew of the first when they speak about not being paid enough; the commander confuses two marines, Hudson (Michael Biehn) and Hicks (Bill Paxton), and we are afforded a shot of Ripley looking on in horror at her escorts.When the time comes, of course the film breaks out into action - armed soldiers versus a nest of beasts when it's discovered a process similar to what befell John Hurt in 'Alien' occurred to an unwitting inhabitant of the colony. But, without question, the film is more than merely two hours of blazing guns and wretched shootouts - there is variety to the set pieces and they're executed really well: pulsating gunfights in rooms drowned in red light give way to retreats into ventilation shafts; there is a dramatic confrontation in the cargo bay of a giant spaceship, which refuses to end when it spills into the airlock. Midway through, Ripley is trapped in a small bunkroom with a crawling specimen eager to attach itself to her face where every little rattle and clank is unnerving. What additionally struck me was just how difficult it was to predict who was safe and who wasn't.Moreover, the film is a poised character study of Ripley negating this new nightmare with an infant girl called Newt (Carrie Henn), orphaned by the monsters, and allowing Weaver's character a kind of second chance at good mothering. She may have failed to live up to the promise she made to the daughter we find out about, but damned if she's going to fail to get Newt out of this jam. The arc is eventually afforded closure as Ripley and an alien queen, responsible for the eggs from which the aliens essentially harbour their existences, confront one another and we remember it was one of the queen's own offspring which ultimately took Ripley's time with her own little girl away from her. 'Aliens' is a taut, well-made sequel and well worth seeing.",7,2,6,30 April 2019
The Exorcist," Try to come into possession of this great title, as a number of good things under the banner of wondrous direction come to fruition.
","In The Exorcist, director William Friedkin weaves you down a tense and terrifying path of trauma; resilience; suffering; grief; the questioning of faith and, ultimately, evil. By the time the film had bedded down into this, rather literally, one on one scenario between the powers of good and evil, locked away within the confinement of a young girl's bedroom, I was worn out in all the right ways and there was still much more to come. The film fascinatingly and meticulously balances the plight of a handful of characters caught up with one another whilst on the front-line of a case involving the possession of a young girl by a demon. It details the agony and confusion at what might be wrong with her, by those close to her, right the way through to the plight of a police detective wanting to solve the cases of a handful of murders perpetrated by said spirit; all of it wonderfully well and without ever over tilting the emphasis on any one story.The film will begin in The Middle East, specifically Iraq, and an archaeologist is undergoing a large dig with dozens of locals in searching for something which is eventually found. The sense that the archaeologist has been there for a fair while, in attempting to find what it was he was looking for, is put across by way of his arriving at some ancient ruins before having some armed guards retreat upon seeing whom it actually is that has hared up to their entrance in a jeep. His time away from home and in this location suggests a great importance surrounding the item he's searching for, an importance that we feel has seen this elderly man sacrifice most of his later years in looking for it. What he finds appears to be more than a mere physical item, the apparent fever that follows his uncovering of a small fist sized trinket having him suddenly become aware of all the relatively uncanny iconography in the form of gargoyles and such when around the ancient ruins he clearly frequents often enough. If, for all that time, the said items did not all that much bother him as they tower over the general locale, then we most certainly feel something must be inherently wrong for him to be affected, scared even, by them now.Friedkin fools us into thinking this is a film about this archaeologist whom uncovered more than he thought he would in the desert. In cutting to a quaint American suburb in the town of Georgetown, Washington; the director executes his first effective gear change in tone, study and general content as the lives of an American actress in Chris MacNeil (Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Blair) are focused on. They dwell in a large, detached house; have a healthy family relationship with one another and the domestic bliss that is this cushy American suburban existence in a really pleasant area seems too good to be true. Another major player in proceedings is young priest Damien Karras (Miller), somebody whose faith to his profession is itself under threat and whose mother is elderly and frail. The boxing trophies, his photographs and the general mise-en-scene of his small apartment in a rough neighbourhood suggests he was once a fighter, a scrapper and apparently quite good at it. A glance at his exterior surroundings and the sorts of people whom inhabit it on the career paths they are twinned with a gradual revealing of the kindhearted manner he exudes suggests a resilience through adversity; an ability to become a priest over a thief or criminal and that he may have fought a fair few battles in his time thus nicely setting things up for later duels.The inclusion of Karras is another element Friedkin introduces still without revealing a discernible pattern to proceedings nor in which the direction the film is heading. We are challenged to form a correlation between the three parties, left hanging on the fate of the early archaeologist and left questioning whose story it is. As things unravel Regan becomes ill and the doctor discerns it as an interior problem of a scientific nature which can be treated despite Regan's claims and pleas. In providing us with a 'sick' character during the opening and wonderfully establishing the extent as to which the illness affected him before cutting away without much resolution, the rendering of Regan as unwell has us wonder as to the extent it will affect her and her ability as this young girl to deal with something that it's been previously established has a powerful affect on people.In years gone by, it might have been crude to ruin what it is that forces Regan to become as ill as she does; needless to say in case you're unaware, the issue is less so a scientific one than it is one of a theological nature. As the rest of the characters are left guessing, police Lieutenant William Kinderman (Cobb) is introduced to the text, Friedkin shooting one of his exchanges with Karras beside a tennis court after previously having them get along rather nicely; the use of the court in the background and link to tennis has us think of a tennis match, specifically a one on one match of gamesmanship unfolding on top of all this other activity as Karras and Kinderman clash over the investigating of the death of a British film-maker linked to Chris. The final act sees Friedkin go for the kill, cracking on ahead with a terrifying series of scenes which work gloriously and round off a wonderful directorial job. The film, essentially a battle between good and evil, is rich in disturbing imagery without being exploitative and high drama covering a number of strands and arcs, all of which work. The Exorcist is a superb thriller, running on controversial subject matter and the brilliant direction required to hit levels of this ilk.",8,2,3,9 September 2010
Gandhi," Sound and diligent recounting of the life of a certain legendary free-thinker; what the film lacks in certain departments, it makes up for in scope and emotional involvement.
","The opening titles of Richard Attenborough's patchy, but irregardless rather accomplished, 1982 biopic Gandhi, a film detailing that of the famous titular Indian, outlines that it doesn't believe a text, indeed a retelling, of his life, through whatever means, '....will ever amount to what is most definitely required to do justice to what he achieved'. Fittingly, the opening captions are kind of on the right tracks from the get-go; the film an interesting in-its-own-right recounting of what a lowly attorney managed to achieve through the ages, but a piece that is never much more than rather interesting and never an awful lot worse than somewhat curious. The film's consummate direction patches over what little-narrative and minuscule character study it actually has going on, but what a directorial feat: The film's evolvement, for the most part, into this power struggle between Gandhi and the millions of Indians against the British Empire comes at us as this slow slog through a mire of animosity that does not allow advance. Translated to the screen, this premise happens to move quite briskly and with pace and engagement; a far cry from the pain and frustration felt by those within.The bagginess of its inability to tell a proper story, more-so a dapper retelling, is rarely more than evident during its closing acts, during which the film is so eager to recount mostly everything in terms of ground covered, that it swoops through not only the dissolution of the British Raj, but the forming of the independence of what is now India; the birth of the nation of Pakistan; how it was these events were influenced by the Second World War's conclusion and the infamous moment of Gandhi's actual assassination - each of which unravel in barely that of twenty or so minutes after two hours plus of progressive episodes in the lead's life. On the other hand, critical reaction citing the film for moving too slowly be damned; at least for its final curtain sprint.Where the biographical qualities of the picture hold up to varying degrees of success, there is a gnawing sensation born out of its repetition to get across precisely what it was the man stood for: change and independent movement through the spoken word, and not force. This is inherently evident when the film no longer has an awful lot left to depict on the side of Gandhi's tale, and instead beds down into that neat groove of what is essentially a power struggle between ruling British forces, and their violent ways, and Gandhi's voice of independence played out through that aforementioned spoken word. It is Ben Kingsley bringing to life that of the great man of the last century or so; the film beginning with his death, consequent funeral and then a radio broadcaster reiterating to us, the listening audience, what we ought to know straight off of the bat. His death, we knew of; the sadness enveloping this newfound nation, we were aware of – the rest of the film, following this verbal confirmation, an historical retelling of all those things we perhaps lived in ignorance of.People misunderstood, indeed underestimated, Mahatma Gandhi from what appears a very early stage. His raucous with a train guard in 1893 South Africa over a first class compartment dwelling is a happening born out of the fact they doubted a black individual would even have Gandhi's then job, something highlighting not only the raging jingoism rife throughout the colonies but the sense of conflict and racial tension that seemingly travelled with Gandhi throughout. When he reaches his employer following this train journey, and occupies a lush office full of suited men, we witness Gandhi moving around; pacing; contemplating and seemingly always active – a picture of ideas and movement and something contrasted by everyone else's very passive, very still demeanour as they sit or stand and proceed.Things press on and this marginalist attitude to those of differing races does not cease; a routine demonstration-come-public speaking routine in broad day light of little significance quickly mutating into a brawl involving local police officers and a silencing of the voice. Gandhi shifts more predominantly into politics, or motivational speaking, following some gained ground out of his South African exploits; a travelling to an India he states he 'knows little of' his next port of call. India, or the British Raj, is firmly in the grip of the imperialist attitude of colonial Britain - the man's mission to seemingly transfer beliefs and writings on what he's to the here and now so as to quell some of the marginalisation rife throughout the Providences. There is an early instance seeing him talk in a Colosseum-like locale to an audience made up of many individuals. They are of a Muslim, Hindu and policing variety, but are essentially representative of those he is charged of bringing together as they sit there uneasily in their own little sects. His journeying through this field is punctuated by that of the appearance of Martin Sheen's character, an American journalist named Vincent Walker; a man whom cannot even pronounce Gandhi's name at the beginning of his tours but comes to enthusiastically shout reports and such down phone lines post-Gandhi speeches. The film is no doubt worthy in its painting of a portrait of a man inclined to get an awful lot done in the smartest; most diligent and, indeed, eloquent of manners – those of whom know only of violence, encapsulated by the higher-ups of the empire, are more often than not represented by the drones out on the front-line barking and squabbling with locals sick of their presence. The film accomplished without being an overtly stunning piece of drama; instead, a diverting yet consummate film doing its material justice in the most applied of fashions.",6,0,1,29 August 2011
American History X," Antagonistic and ruffling but all but deeply involving American drama; a forceful and affecting character piece really worth seeing.
","Told amidst a furry of tough flashbacks and present tense broiling drama, through an array of colour footage and black and white hues, Tony Kaye's American History X devilishly explores the life of a Neo-Nazi, both pre-and-post-incarceration, as well as his suffering family in a bare and unrelenting fashion. We dislike the opening of the film, we dislike the opening of Kaye's film on the basis that it is ugly and frank; we dislike the fact that we are challenged to process not only the apparent ugliness of the sexual content but the Nazi infused props littering the screen, and are forced into calculating which of those leaves the nastier taste. We dislike the fact that, next door in a room of his own, is situated a young boy seemingly forced into possessing a building with such a person complete with such activity going on in such close proximity. We side with the boy, and are somewhat forced against our wishes into sympathising with all of those whom inhabit the house when a group of blank, faceless African-Americans plot outside to sabotage the car on the driveway – and all of this before the really nasty bit happens.It is to the credit of those behind American History X that they are able to take the project from these beginnings and to do what they do; the film much more than a freak show unfolding in a cesspool of crudity and violence - the film refusing to allow its powerful opening to act as its dramatic high point, instead allowing the transitions it documents to act as its key source of drama, in what is a pleasurable and really rather involving thriller about changing attitudes and the dangers of influence. Those primarily involved in the opening are that of Edward Furlong's Danny, the boy in his room, and that of his older brother Derek, played by Edward Norton. They are siblings of the Vinyard family, the pair of them two Los Angeles based brothers. Danny is a high school student; Derek is something a little different, but they share the pain of their father's death, following the falling foul of a black individual, and maintain ties to their mother who's trying to maintain a new relationship.Danny raises eyebrows at school after doing a school paper that is a riff on Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, something which causes great concern amidst his peers. Elliott Gould's character Murray, Danny's history teacher, is worried of the possibility he may follow down a route similar to that of his brother; the verbal outlining of whom shortly follows as the severity of Norton's character is built up, a speech which documents the man's history to do with formulating a national front along with some other radical thinkers that concludes with the fact he is about to be released from prison following a three year stretch. Despite the severity of Murray's outlining, Norton's Derek later appears somewhat chilled upon release; cool at the fact his younger brother has moved up into some echelons more broadly resembling that of where Derek himself was at a similar age. It is a reaction, and whose general behaviour, goes against prior perceptions; particularly when interacting with his fascist friend of old in Seth (Suplee), whom looks up to Derek and half-expects him, along with the rest of a neo-Nazi front that has formulated, to really lead them to where they want to go.Kaye's film will dart back and forth from some relatively tough sequences motivated by hatred and racism to the current tense of reform. Shot in black and white, and holding very little back, Derek's earlier times of violence and antagonism carry with them a cutting, biting aesthetic; a prominent sense of the content always being on the move sewn into proceedings, whether induced by the man's motivational speeches encouraging hate and anti-social behaviour, shortly before the playing out of such things, or the more visually dramatic sequences such as that of a basketball match between two teams that has some high stakes. Derek's post-incarceration exchanges, shot in colour, but still looking as if drained, although successfully coming across as glorious Technicolour in comparison to the rancid black and white, appear calmer; more laid-back and are not motivated by causality as much. Kaye's compositions during these segments additionally appear to open up a little more, allowing for more room to breath and for those of foreign nationalities, or varying other ethnicities, to share the frame a little more – when, nearer the end, Danny is escorted to school by his brother, we notice those of an African American or Hmong ilk milling around in the background, as if invited to occupy the film's frame with the two leads as a collective one such is the newfound sense of acceptance.The film's starker sequences indeed carry with them great adrenaline and a sense of the perversely engaging, the aforementioned basketball sequence one of many that additionally includes the trashing of a local store now owned by some Koreans as well as a grotesquely violent act during the opening. In spite of this, the film maintains such an aggressive and pent-up attitude for the sequences in which Derek confronts his past neo-Nazi accomplices; a lesser film made in a lesser fashion might have, purposely or otherwise, done well, in a negative sense, to fetishise such sequences of hate and shoot the gradual inclination toward a newer order in a drabber fashion. Another instance might have seen the content played safe, a film distancing itself from such sequences of bigotry before constructing the demonisation process in a self-important manner threatening to mutate the piece into some kind of lecture. Kaye impressively, purposely or otherwise, blows through the material in an equal on-both-fronts-fashion; maintaining a dogged grip on dramatic proceedings as controversial content is executed and hate at those the lead previously shared times with is unfolded. Regardless, the film is tough but engaging and worth seeing.",7,0,1,28 June 2011
Saw III," Lot's of blood and traps for those out hunting and, refreshingly, it meekly offers something a little more in the way of study.
","There is a common phrase throughout the third edition of the Saw series, namely: 'face your fears'; perhaps a sly nod to the audience themselves as they go through this ordeal of watching someone else go through a further ordeal - psychologically as well as physically. You have to hand it to the people that make this stuff; the marketing is disturbingly effective. Initially, we were 'dared' to see Saw and Saw II. Maybe we did, maybe we didn't. Now, we have 'face your fears' pasted over most walls and doors in the film as the beginning of a new 'test' is established to about to happen and we inhale, grab hold of something and get ready for the next gross-out/squirm-in-your-seat moment. They've roped us in via the dare to see the first two, now we cannot help ourselves.The third Saw film was not the disaster I was expecting, in fact it actually attempts to flesh out a character and, for the first time, presents us with a delicate protagonist at the film's core who is given the chance to essentially 'play God' with some previously set up traps. What the film wants us to think he undergoes in the long run is a transformation from vengeful, depressed individual to a man forced to come to terms with his emotions; forced to forgive those responsible for his prior feelings and undergo some sort of journey of redemption. But that's not what anyone is watching a Saw film for, that's for sure. The ideas are there, and they're developed in a certain regard but the film is clearly more interested in the blood; the gore and these traps that the screenwriters and producers, in some manner or another, manage to dream up.The man undergoing the ordeal is Jeff (Macfadyen), a man whose son was killed in a hit and run accident in which the 'guilty' parties involved were the driver himself, whom got a very short jail sentence; the judge that gave him that short sentence; the onlookers that saw the incident but ran off and the doctors that couldn't actually save the boy. Each of them are rendered helpless in a series of audacious traps that tap into: medieval torture; the sensation of drowning; the sensation of freezing to death as well as out and out decisions based on whether you can find it within yourself to execute a man. Some are more gruesome than others, and after each trap before venturing into the next, Jeff seems to remove a layer of clothing such as a jacket or a cover or something; perhaps a shedding of a persona or a 'skin' as the film progresses.But again, no one's come to notice those sorts of things. The film's immediate beginning sees a hapless individual hooked up to several chains, but a preceding scene is set in the dungeon he is trapped as the police investigate several dismembered pieces of flesh following a small explosion. The cutting to the chained up prisoner trying to escape is a futile exercise as we already know what's to come and this is just an excuse to show us some of the material that gives Saw its reputation as this senseless; mindless passage of traps, horror and blood. Following this, a female law enforcer is snatched for merely doing her job and is 'punished' for love of her work through a device linked to her ribcage – it's as nasty as it sounds, but it's completely unnecessary.Mercifully, and I do mean mercifully, the film ditches this short passage of play and actually gives us a narrative plus protagonist to latch onto, he being Jeff and the series of scenarios he finds himself in. On a strand happening parallel to Jeff's crusade, Jigsaw (Bell) himself must rely on assistant Amanda (Smith) and nurse Lynn Denlon (Soomekh) to see him through some gut-wrenching scenes of brain surgery as Lynn is charged with performing a life saving operation – the catch is if he dies, an explosive collar attached to Lynn's neck will go off thus killing her.As a lead character, it's easy to connect with Jeff. He's given a meek amount of pre-crusade build-up as we see him dejected and vulnerable in his suburban house, dressed in some pyjamas. It's all rather manipulative, but in Jeff we have a very specific reason to engage in the text and will someone through the film rather than just sit back and observe people we don't really know that well, quite possibly getting cut up. Saw III will no doubt appeal to those that are fans of the franchise; much in the same way Episode Three of the Star Wars franchise might or recent prequel Hannibal Rising might to fans of those respective franchises. This is due to said films' attempts at the deconstructing of the villain and Saw III looks to further Jigsaw's deconstruction that began in Saw II. It attempts to humanise its chief antagonist – the reason so many nasty things happen to so many 'bad' people. In this regard, it succeeds but like mentioned examples, only on a very, very basic level.I think it would be too harsh to say Saw III 'masquarades' as a study of morality, redemption and forgiveness, but it is this sort of study 'dressed up' around a lot of gore and dismemberment. Fanatics will enjoy the traps and the horror of it all; those such as myself whom view it with a neutral eye might get a kick out of the study plus twists and those specifically out to hate it won't take to it at all. But the most interesting thing about the film, for me, was that amidst all this gore and all this blood, the most distressing scene involves an oven, some raw emotion and a few stuffed toys combining to make something that's a bit gruesome for very different reasons.",6,0,0,18 May 2009
Pearl Harbor," Big, blundering brute of a film that flashes around as uncontrollably as an unmanned hosepipe on full power.
","Isn't it annoying when the boundaries between the war genre and the action genre are blurred to the point that the piece eventually just resembles out-and-out exploitation? Pearl Harbor, or 'Pearl Harbour' to the Brits or further still 'Pearl Harbore' to anyone with any common sense - regardless of nationality, is a film that blurs these boundaries to the point of blindness. It ploughs through the rule book like a freight train slamming through a blockade made out of matchsticks. Pearl Harbor sees war and human misery as an excuse to get across the shock and awe of experiencing bombs dropping around you; gunshots going off mere feet away from you and death and destruction everywhere you turn; all in glorious, soft focus and drenched out cinematography. War films should primarily be war films that sometimes, or might not at all, contain a little bit of action – Pearl Harbor is an action film that sometimes, or might not even at all, contain a little bit of war.Pearl Harbor etches out just about everything the audience it is aimed at would want out of a film: romance; action; gunfights; comedy; retribution; attractive leads, all in a runtime of about two and a half plus hours; all under the facade of historical non-fiction and real life tragedy. In historical terms, you won't learn anything from Pearl Harbor that you wouldn't be able to pick up off the back of a themed, kiddie orientated cereal box: 'This semester: Second World War Trivia!' The latter third of Pearl Harbor reminded me of an old; 1945 made; Spanish produced and propagandist driven piece entitled 'The Last Ones of the Philippines', as this 99 minute piece of drivel about brave, Spanish soldiers defiantly holding up against all the odds in a symbolist-driven location (that being the local church) as various acts of heroism and 'upstanding-ness' are played out.The notion being that war works; war can be a good thing if it means being able to get across what makes a nation, or a nation's attitudes and/or beliefs, 'great'. The catholic driven iconography of the church in said example echoes one such character's eventual demise much later on in Pearl Harbor as we realise he is killed trying to protect a friend whilst tied to a cross – a fitting iconographic intervention. Whereas the ideology of the poor, brave leads refusing to go down without a fight as they strike back with the Dolittle raids/hold up in the said location suggests a sense of victory/accomplishment even though the overall times for the nation are that of dark ones.I've read about it before, and I'm in agreement on the point that Bay doesn't want to end his film with the Pearl Harbor attack because it's a downer, when Bay's film-making ideology is all about anything but. Generic, Hollywood action films (Pearl Harbor is an action film, remember?), it seems, are supposed to have happy endings. Ending with the darkest hour in America's history (at least up to that point in 2001) is seen as not the way to go. But with hindsight, does United 93 go on for another hour after it ends; further documenting what America did in response to the events explored in that film? Of course not; it's an honourable and harrowing depiction of something that happened, not a glamorous; 'feel good'; action movie designed to excite.The film will eventually see Americans Rafe McCawley (Affleck) and Danny Walker (Hartnett) become pilots, but initially they mix and mingle with one another as young kids. They play on Danny's father's farm in a disused crop-duster, pretending to fly and shoot down enemy planes; essentially capturing Bay's overall attitudes to the war genre, one of which says it is just one big game in which gun fire and dogfights play a large part in 'having fun'. One day, they accidentally take up a real crop duster – much to father's displeasure, and he berates them in what is one, brief fleeting moment of realisation of how horrid war is; when he recounts what it was like in the trenches of World War One.From here, they follow up on their love of flying by becoming United States Army Air Corps First Lieutenants, all the time under the watchful eye of James Doolittle (Baldwin). This is in between getting involved with some of the nurses after they're all posted to Pearl Harbor, the nurses; of whom represent some of the loosest, dumbest, most flirtatious, most pouting ever seen on film. They are nothing but mere prizes, what with their bright red lipstick and on-screen vibrancy; they exist only to be 'won' by the male pilots and navy personnel - the one that causes the most trouble is Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale). Along for the ride is Red Winkle (Bremner); an annoying, stammering character whose deformity is nothing but the butt of most jokes; one of which occurs seconds before the Japanese actually attack Pearl Harbor as he blurts 'The Japs are here(!)' in what is a monumentally mistimed gag on Bay's behalf.Then there is the attack itself; while technically brilliant, displaying a good awareness of where the planes and boats are in relation to one another, it exists to titillate; to excite: it should be harrowing, but Bay turns it into the film's money shot – he turns it into the most exciting thing in the film when it ought to be saddest, with the item that is the saddest something else completely un-related to the Pearl Harbor attack. 'I think World War Two just started(!)' spouts some idiot character as it all plays out. The film is a monumental misfire; a politically-driven load of clap-trap, with an ideology that reads something like: 'You do not mess with America!', one that sees the Japanese given five seconds of backlog and President Roosevelt, circa 1941, actually stand up and walk. Too bad there was no last stand in a church.",4,7,13,13 September 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Hypocritical and ill-judged mess; in which the titular Scott Pilgrim does not, in fact, take on the world but does make room for Edgar Wright to take on our patience.
","Was Gregory's Girl as remade by Stephen Chow really what the world needed? Accomplished British director Edgar Wright's latest, the graphic novel adaptation of the same name in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, is the frenetic; overly energetic and just generally annoying version of such a thing. Here is a needless, post-modern explosion of tricks and gimmicks; the film appearing to want to be some sort of a cautionary, screwball comedy depicting the lengths people go for those they love; the entire thing ending up an often unbearable slog which, in spite of the adult foundations, comes across as a ill-judged and immature trudge through a mire rife with very little content to get involved in and very little to actually like. Drawing on a parallel to what the likes of respective British directors Danny Boyle and Paul McGuigan tried for in the late-nineties, Wright blurs the lines between realism and surrealism for his American audiences; enabling characters to achieve a great deal of what humans cannot often in the presence of a lot of other people whom witness it, but do not react in any great way that suggests the activity is out of the ordinary. Michael Cera, stretching his acting limitations, here plays the softly-spoken; weedy looking, although more confident than you give him credit, young man somewhere in between that of high-school, university and the beginnings of full time employment. He is named Scott Pilgrim. As the title might suggest, it is him versus the world; only, it isn't. In fact, for the bulk of the time, Wright's film features the titular character taking on a handful of ex-lovers. When it isn't doing that act, it briefly focuses on both he and his girlfriend against one other ex-lover, before further still briefly veering off to focus on that of Scott's ex-partner taking on his current one.Living in the Canadian city of Toronto, Scott is frequently a guitarist in a band. He has recently come out of a relationship with a woman he felt a great deal for; the nature of its capitulation leading him into a tryst with that of Hmong girl Knives (Wong). The members of his band, particularly that of snotty drummer Kim (Pill), entrust it to be a façade relationship; such accusations begin to mutate into statements of truth when fiery, but underplayed in that alluring way, Ramona (Winstead) arrives with her dizzy arrays of coloured hairstyles and tendency to roller-skate around if outdoors, - Scott going on to woo her. In all intents and purposes, the character of Knives is the most interesting; prior to being dumped, her innocent demeanour and carefree attitude when she's with Scott encapsulates a universal exterior of happy-go-lucky living and enjoyment. A crucial scene sees her partake in an act which doubles up as the film's entire nucleus; specifically, when she changes her hair colour out of reaction for being ditched for Ramona and her wacky ideas in regards to hair, in what is a brief capturing of the tribulations and reactionary process one might go through for means of love; the opposite sex or attention and affection.Unfortunaley, Wright decides to explore the thesis by way of Cera's rather arrogant and somewhat unlikable character; an exercise executed via a process of inherent boredom during which four-or-so too many fight sequences act as the centrepieces around which a bunch of offbeat sound effects, that are inexplicably taken from arcade machines of old, pepper a demented aesthetic of noise; rabid cutting and quip spouting teenagers. Principally, the film covers Scott and his quest to defeat the seven ex-partner's of Ramona – so, the girl gets around, and in this age of disturbingly high teenage pregnancy figures and societies rife with sexual infections, such a notion does not deserve to be handled with the throwaway attitude it is here. The battling of the exes is an idea which does not go on to spawn any sort of plot per-se, and instead induces a series of fight sequences in the mould of that awful video game of years past 'Tekken'. The fights might unfold in any order, and sadly renders Ramona's essential presence that of a prize awaiting the lead at the end of his quest.Wright brings about these fights during occasions in which violence or hostilities of some description appear apparent: when Scott duels with Matthew Patel (Bhabha), it is at a battle of the bands meeting; when he fights film star Lucas Lee (Evans), it is immediately prior to having watched him shoot a violent scene in his latest movie, whereas the altercation with Todd (Routh, lampooning his Superman role) is a result of the fallout of an argument that they share. Depressingly, the fights largely consist of Scott up against specific groups or individuals of a marginalised sort; flitting from fighting an Indian (complete with out of place mock-Hindu dance); a bi-sexual; a vegan and two synthetic musicians of Japanese nationality, in what is itself a horrid pastiche of the wondrous sequence involving certain antagonistic harpists in Kung-fu Hustle, a film by the aforementioned Stephen Chow. Gregory's Girl it isn't; a film about grounded people with specific interests at important times in their lives coming together and desiring to interact with the opposite sex. The interactions for those people were nerve-wracking; the film subverted gender roles in ways that were refreshing: boys enjoyed culinary and girls wanted to play football. Wright's coming of age film is an abusive assault on the senses; a piece due to play like a horror film to those aged between 12 and 18 whom are yet to have much contact with the opposite sex, which means it has missed the point by a wholly unforgivable margin.",4,11,25,15 August 2011
The Usual Suspects," Quite ingenious crime film that lets you in and then doesn't give you so much as a sniff unless you can spot all the visual clues and then some more.
","Only a film as cryptic as The Usual Suspects could keep you coming back for more and more. A film that is so involved and so smart and engaging in its delivery that it drops several clues to its ending while simultaneously not entirely making them obvious for first time viewers. In fact the series of clues; ideas and the overall ending is so famous, it's been referenced and spoofed in so many other pieces of text that these days it would be almost impossible to watch without knowing what everything revolves around. The mere fact the ending and whole idea has featured in these other texts only confirms The Usual Suspects' cult status and is really just an appreciation or 'acceptance' that it is truly a fantastic film.The film is an all over the place (in the nicest possible way), crime drenched neo-noir which cuts back and forth from police station to detective trying to get to the bottom of a supposed drug deal gone wrong on one equilibrium; but also to the flashbacks which are the making of the drug deal on another equilibrium. The film sees visual references, audio references, what characters do as well as general dialogue drop hints as to what is coming and what the truth really is  hell; in one instance, where a certain character looks is an important clue. But The Usual Suspects is more than a series of tricks and gimmicks masquerading under a decent cast and a well shot, well lit crime saga. It is a journey into a world of the detective; it is a race against time and it is a non-linear crime saga revolving around organised crime, criminals and drug lords.I have to admit that I didn't fully understand the film first time I saw it, but with the added aid of research and DVD extras, The Usual Suspects quickly became one of my favourite films in terms of atmosphere, narrative and the general pacing of the story being unfolded. The film also carries a certain air of manipulation and ambiguity in its presentation, forcing us to think one thing; forcing us to recognise with seemingly the most unnecessary things imaginable: the way a certain character speaks nearer the beginning; the direction a certain character looks and what they're looking at as well as what certain characters are telling other characters and how they're reacting to it despite the fact we've already seen it.If it all sounds complicated then that's because it is, but that's the beauty of the film when it comes to multiple viewings. Everything is set up in a fast and urgent manner after a more sedate and much more calmer opening in which the aftermath of a shoot out on a boat introduces the prologue to the main strand of the film: an interrogation (or a 'friendly chat' according to the interrogating police man) between Verbal Kint (Spacey) and the officer, David Kujan (Palminteri). The brilliance in the delivery of Kint's story to Kujan lies in its parallel placing with the scenes revolving around the rounding up of the criminals which culminates in that famous line up shot; the developing of their friendship/hatred; the jobs that they do for a mysterious figure known as Redfoot (Greene) and the situation they all find themselves in once crime king Keyser Söze (can't put actor's name in brackets) catches up with them.If we look at how the criminals consisting of McManus (Baldwin); Keaton (Byrne); Fenster (del Toro); Hockney (Pollak) and Kint are rounded up in the first place, we can see that out of all the arrests Keaton's is given the most dramatic and most coveted. When he is arrested, he is in an expensive restaurant indulging in a rich conversation as opposed to the others whom are crudely rounded up on street corners and in garages. From here Keaton is made to look, perhaps not the most criminal, but certainly the most intelligent of the band but the rest of them are petty criminals or in Kint's case, crippled. This immediately places a higher opinion on Keaton in our minds and already, the film is attempting to brainwash us with its 'who's who'. The extensive dialogue later on constantly keeping Keaton in the dark as to who he could really be helps maintain this doubt as does his scrachy background and his failure to get a business empire off the ground.Then there is the manipulation of the supporting characters. I mentioned Redfoot being mysterious, something the film establishes with eerie music as his car rolls up to the gang. They meet amongst some odd looking Japanese mise-en-scene definitely un-associated with the location they're currently in: Los Angles, further adding to the bizarre and somewhat surreal nature of both the scene and the film. But there are several incidences where what you think was right, indeed wasn't and as the film develops things become increasingly dramatic culminating in a scene involving a notice board that still chills me even after so many viewings. Quite simply; The Usual Suspects is a smart and engaging film, the likes of which can be revisited time and time again.",10,2,3,21 July 2008
Die Hard 2," For the lead, it's the same #!*$ happening to the same guy twice; but for the audience, Harlin provides a different, more escapist approach to proceedings.
","As an action film with a substantial amount of plot and peril running along side the necessity to develop and unfold the tales of a number of different parties and characters, whom share differing attitudes to the overall situation, Die Hard 2 is probably a lot better then it really has any right to be. Renny Harlin's film covers American mercenaries turned terrorists with an agenda; the strains airport staff suffer as a result of this; passengers in the planes above essentially rendered hostages; later, the clinical and urgent actions of a special operations team specifically called in as well as the eponymous hero of the entire franchise: police lieutenant John McLane and where he fits in to all of it. The director does an admirable job in balancing each of the perspectives, borrowing from the first Die Hard film of two years previous, but with a knowing sense, whilst trying to go bigger and consequently better with more threat; more action and more spectacle. It doesn't quite cross that divide in the manner some sequels do but needless to say, the film suffices.The film is a part of a brief pre 9/11 canon of terrorists or whatever seizing a mode of public transport or otherwise and wrecking havoc; a canon you might cite began with the first Die Hard. With films such as Executive Decision; Speed; Under Siege 2; Air Force One and Con Air following on in later years, two or three of which maintained an aeronautical theme, Die Hard 2 stands somewhat high and mightily over its aforementioned cousins. This 1990 film sticks to the first film's guns in following Willis' John McLane caught way out of his depth; here, a similar premise having him arrive at a large, busy locale with the aim to meet up with his wife for the Christmas period. Like the L.A. based high-rise of the first, in which the New York cop was a blurry eyed fish out of water in this more intimate and free flowing California, Dulles airport is a hostile Washington based zone of paranoia, security driven authority and routine.The film will begin with McLane's car being towed from a no-park zone, plunging him into a realm of failure or pertaining to struggle in his surroundings. The location of the airport interior is busy, chaotic even, with a mass of bodies cramped into close proximity with one another for the festive period and McLane has to work hard just to find a phone, get from one interior place to another and deal with a shooting that carries its own little tasks. McLane's role of being that rose amongst the thorns is verbally reiterated to us by a certain Carmine Lorenzo (Franz), a chief of airport police whom tells McLane that he is 'in my little pond now' and that he himself is 'the big fish that runs it'.The antagonist of the piece is a certain Colonel Stuart (Sadler), a former U.S. Army Special Forces trooper whose introduction is inter-cut with McLane's and sees him practise martial art moves in low lighting with nothing on but the television, something he promptly turns off by fast-drawing a remote control. The sequence demonstrates control, precision and a balanced sense of both aggression and technique; echoing his attitudes to the task at hand he'll later face and how he'll deal in going about completing it. A point is additionally made so as to highlight McLane's inability to apparently operate in the 'digital' world, with some casual jibes at this lack; the film thus planting its final seed reflecting the magnitude of what McLane's up against by making so as to show Stuart's troops set up a load of extravagant looking machines and computers highlighting the ease in their ability to do what comes so difficultly to McLane. The rouge Special Forces troopers apprehend the entire airport's electronics and use them so as to make the interception of a South American drug baron who's being brought into the airport, in custody, so as to face charges. He is Ramon Esperanza (Nero) and is faced with the curious situation have having just the solitary in-flight guard watching over him.Despite drawing on inspiration from the first Die Hard, the sequel cannot quite top it. Gone is the estrangement McLane had from his wife, here meaning small intricacies such as the use of the gold watch she received as a gift from a male co-worker acting as the representation of the emotional distance between them; later cast away during said film's finale. Kept is the idea of McLane being caught in the middle of a feud between the police or figures of authority and the wrong-doers and kept is the sense of danger. His wife, Holly (Bedelia), is given little to do this time other than remain in the sky and play the role of a person no different to anyone else whom needs rescuing as her strong, empowering role from the first film is substituted for a subplot with journalist from the first film Richard Thornburg (Atherton), who coincidentally is on her plane. Holly's clashing with Thornburg runs on what he did in turning up to the McLane residence with a camera crew in the first film, and her victory over him here does not carry the substantial weight her role did in the first film; in that the attack is rendered personal and stops Thornberg from essentially doing what his job is. General suspense and whatever pot boiling there is in the film is replaced towards the end with wall to wall action, mostly chases involving snowmobiles; helicopters and jets but it is effective and harmless enough via Harlin's decent enough action directing. The film is an intriguing battle of wits and oneupmanship running on a race against time premise as the planes above have their fuel levels fall. It goes bigger than the first but doesn't quite go better.",7,0,3,27 August 2010
Resident Evil," What a Shame.
","It's disappointing when a successful computer game franchise is brought to the screen in a disappointing fashion and that's exactly what's happened here. When a Resident Evil computer game comes out, it's a bit of an event especially to the die hard fans of the series. I, myself own Resident Evil 2 and have played every single title at some point down the years. This, you would suggest does not classify me as a die hard fan and you're correct but what I am quite a large fan of is survival films such as '28 Days Later', 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Dog Soldiers' so watching 'Resident Evil' was pretty compulsory, fan of the games or not.Everything was set up nicely, the situation was clearly established as it must've been tricky to do a first Resident Evil film, especially after several games; 'where do you start?' springs to mind. However, what follows is a case of 'where do we continue from?' The film seemed to get into a gear and just stay there the whole time. I grew tired of the same location over and over and the way all of the characters look the same. There was no real suspense, no real monsters from the games, no real proper weaponry, in fact the whole thing just dug itself in and stuck itself there for two and a bit hours, a real shame as there was some potential what with the games creating such a success. We aren't treated to many of the games characters either and for most of them, I couldn't really care less if they survived, there is even a temptation to hope that they all snuff it anyway.In fact, the ultimate irony is when they actually get up onto the street surface which is where I wanted the film to take place. This would be fine except: it happens right at the very end of the film! A lot of damn good that is! The REAL survival starts just as all the other rubbish ends. I really can't see the point of this film as from what I understand, with the second film street based, this is just a break in for the absolute non-fans of the game who won't mind not seeing the characters and monsters from the game because they won't even have played it! Where as for the fans, no matter how large or how small they are; they're guaranteed to be disappointed.How ironic- aiming a film based on a successful gaming series at people who AREN'T fans of the games.I didn't enjoy this that much, I'm afraid.",5,1,2,29 June 2005
Quantum of Solace," Really struggles in certain areas but as a mystery with an element of espionage it works on a basic level, just don't expect an all round experience.
","Quantum of Solace is a mixed bag, and it's a real, real mixed bag. On one hand, the film is a very passable and dare I say entertaining affair that just manages to be enough time without outstaying its welcome but still leaves that nasty, niggling feeling after it's finished that it was nothing special on the whole. Following on from 2006's hugely successful Casino Royale, successful because it practically saved a franchise, is Swiss director Marc Forster continuing the tale but unfortunately, he cannot bring his style and European inspired grace that gave us the slow, rewarding and powerful character driven dramas such as Monster's Ball.The choice of director is a strange one. On IMDb, the trivia section states Bond actor Daniel Craig himself recommended Marc Forster and it seems the studio listened but since when was it a good idea for the cast to start choosing who's making the damn film? Secondly, since Quantum of Solace is the first Bond film to be a direct sequel, why was a new director chosen in the first place? Usually, the same director for the sequel or following film works better than a new creative talent all together. If the studio knew this film was going to be a direct sequel (the planning took place before Casino Royale was wrapped) then they should've made sure Campbell was on board for sure. Apply it to other works; Peter Jackson made all three Lord of the Rings films and Greengrass made the second and third Bourne films; all five examples of which have garnered a lot of fan following.So the general set up before the film has even begun is rather messy and this is before the film has started. Quantum of Solace is two different sorts of beast. Firstly; the large espionage, driven plot about one man hunting for revenge of a loved one is actually handled reasonably well and never grates in the same way a Death Wish sequel probably would. But twinned with these scenes of tracking, following and generally interesting mystery surrounding a large criminal organisation and its shifty members are the action scenes and boy, what a mess.I don't know what it was with either the writer's or the director but they seemed to be doing things in stages. The pre-credit sequence is a chase through Siena in Italy, one of a few places introduced via erratic and deliberately post-modern graphics and fonts that feel a bit silly. The chases in the film involve cars and later on will involve people on rooftops and later on will involve boats and later still will involve aeroplanes  it's this sort of Michael Bay inspired hierarchy that drags Quantum of Solace down; a sort of 'every chase will be bigger and better than the last!' mentality that grates on you as you sit and watch it unfolding at paced intervals of about twenty minutes.But again, this is just the set up and the general mentality behind the chases with the visualisation of the scenes is slightly worse. In short, and I will not be the last to notice this, the editing is terrible. Constant moving, tracking, cutting and one on occasion, slow motion as the camera glides to the side yet enforces its rapid editing on show. The film's attention to space and the space that the characters inhabit is equally poor; Bond has a gun, Bond is shooting and bad guys are dropping around him like flies  it gets to the point where Bond may just as well be shooting up into the air above him and we can cut to someone below him, dropping and thus being eliminated. The establishment of where we are and where people are and how they're going to go about achieving their goal of killing each another is just nonexistent.But I like the overall feeling the film tries to get across in the sense Bond, played well by Daniel Craig, and his accomplice Camille (Kurylenko) are both after the same thing in the film (revenge through death of a loved one) but must use one another to get closer to their goal. Incidentally, Camille is anything but the glamorous beauty who exists to be looked at, something previous Bond films have been guilty of doing to their women, although the treatment of ally Strawberry Fields (why did they send a woman to apprehend Bond in the first place?) is unfortunate and the negatives do outweigh the positives. If Casino Royale helped move the franchise away from petty references and the use of gimmicky gadgets (the invisible car was a tad over the top), then Quantum of Solace threatens to undo a lot of good work by pushing the series back down to that area. The excessive shots of the technology in the film, such as screens that seem to suspend themselves in mid air in the middle of offices or others that react to touch and evoke copious amounts of information at a fantastic rate, too fantastic even.Then there are the Goldfinger references such as the certain character covered in oil rather than gold paint whilst lying on the bed and the bad guy's lair at the very end which, maybe it's just me, looks distinctly like the interior of Fort Knox with its coloured interior; steel walkways and general look. The film is nothing to write home about but it quenches a lot of espionage related thirsts with a healthy mix of action and dialogue, complete with betrayals and meek statements on today's political climate what with the increasing lack of oil and the shifty activities the Americans might be indulging in, some of it to do with 'friendly fire'. Quantum of Solace isn't great but it's a fun enough time that doesn't creep too low beyond the line of negativity, like it could've done.",6,1,3,21 November 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Mostly misses the mark, often in a way that is both long and even disrespectful to what preceded.
","Surely a mark has been missed when things which were once genuinely frightening have become merely incidental; when things that had the propensity to be quite terrifying now just seem to exist to fill runtimes. Take the scene in 'Alien v Predator', Paul W.S. Anderson's 2004 adaptation of a comic book which became a video game, and features the much admired franchise monsters, whereby a Predator grabs a new-born alien mid-air as it leaps out at him - too flippantly, in my opinion. Or, worse still, the similar moment whereby a face-hugger is diced in half when it too makes an attempt on a Predator's presence. I can recall when characters creeping around alien infested corridors were once atmospheric and effective; here, reduced to inducing little more than a passing interest. What happened?'Alien versus Predator', or 'AVP' if you're hip, begins with a young American woman named Alexa, played by Sanaa Lathan, climbing a Himalayan mountain. She's by herself, which means she's fearless and independent. Suddenly, some ice gives way - panic, but she negates this and gets back on track before calmly making it all the way to the summit. Lo-and-behold a chopper, which she must surely have heard, has already landed there and sees its inhabitants offer her a once in a lifetime opportunity in Antarctica. Nothing suspicious about any of this.The opportunity turns out to be the chance to explore a pyramid, more synonymous with ancient civilisations based thousands of miles away, which has been discovered well below the ice. Think hard and you will be reminded of 'Stargate'. Others have been assembled, but only Raoul Bova's character Sebastian, who needs the money to fund an archaeological dig, has been afforded an introduction beyond Ewen Bremner's sheepish small-talking Scot. I kept thinking how difficult it was in earlier films in these franchises to pick apart protagonists and how impossible it was to tell whom would still be alive by the end. Though, to some extent, 'AVP' does refrain from going so totally down this road as to completely terminate your interest.Meanwhile, floating around in outer-space, seemingly undetected by Earth's advanced satellite technology, is an alien spacecraft inhabited by a platoon of Predators - the likes of whom had only previously graced our screens on two occasions, in Schwarzenegger's 1987 jungle-bound survival horror and an intriguing 1990 sequel which had some neat ideas. They watch everything unfolding in the pyramid's radius, before enabling the hapless explorers to enter it via an energy beam shot at the structure which melts the ice and creates a makeshift tunnel. Our crew head in, despite being fully aware that 'nothing man-made' could have created the tunnel and without informing any proper authorities on the discovery, which no one seems to have a problem with, despite the chap heading the expedition, Lance Henriksen, quite evidently appearing to be mad.The bulk of the film, within the confines of the pyramid itself, is largely disappointing without being totally unforgivable. The crew make a few nasty discoveries about its history, although I forget what it was they were precisely trying to find; the film, we realise, is not really even aliens against predators, but aliens against some kind of adolescent predators who must prove themselves as warriors. The early parts are peppered with deep senses of foreboding. 'Storm's comin' in!' one person glibly observes. Two other characters look up at the moon, so bright in the sky - one remarks that, where he comes from, 'that kind of moon is the hunter's moon'. It is difficult to take too seriously.Up in space, the Predators all gather around a holographic device and watch what transpires, like it were some kind of piece of audio-visual entertainment in itself, or a wrestling pay-per-view. This is entertainment precipitated by the pyramid managing to manoeuvre its own walls in such a way that face-huggers are able to claim a couple of human victims in order to breed the aliens at all - leaving others to fend for themselves in contained crawlspaces, as if the walls knew exactly what to move and when to keep the ambling explorers forever in the dark.Nearer the end, I was conflicted by which to be the most struck: the words of Brian Helgeland rattling around inside my head about how the lazy way out of any finale for a film-maker is to merely burn the set; the way an alien queen is knocked onto her side with a mere pointy stick, or how a Predator knew there was an escape route out of the pyramid at all having activated a rather large firework. I suppose, in an alternate universe where this is, in fact, the very first time we get to see either an alien or a predator, you might be able to find it in yourself to give the film a passing grade, but I think you would struggle to do so in this reality.",5,2,3,7 September 2007
No Country for Old Men," Brilliantly woven and perfectly executed, No Country for Old Men will surely be a film that etches itself into modern movie folklore.
","The Coen Brothers' late 2007, early 2008 film No Country for Old Men has very, very quickly embedded itself as one of my favourites of the contemporary age of film-making. I've seen it a number of times now, two times of which have been in recent months alone – here is a film I get odd chills in just contemplating watching it or not. If there was a film released in Britain in the calendar year of 2008, that was better than this and wasn't Steven McQueen's Hunger, then I either haven't seen it or it doesn't exist. The film is a burning, brilliantly observed piece, encompassing the horror of the world; morality and plain pure old fashioned film making techniques such as the ability to build suspense and execute action. Once just isn't enough with No Country for Old Men.The film is a crime-infused, MacGuffin driven tale between two predominant sides playing cat-and-mouse with one another in the wide open playground that is the state of Texas in a dusty June, circa 1980. The two warring sides are Josh Brolin's downbeat and somewhat cynical Llewelyn Moss, and he's in direct competition with Spanish actor Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh; a cold and seemingly emotionless killer who appears to have gone rouge from his employers and is now on Moss' tail. Thrown in amidst these two are the elements of innocent bystanders; hide and seek games at road side motels; shop, trailer and toll booth workers; an angry group of Mexican gangsters whom show up in fits and starts with their own prerogative and the law themselves, this time in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff, named Ed Tom Bell.The chaos is ignited when Moss, having accidentally shot a wild animal in the leg whilst trying to score a body shot, notices a trail of blood left by a pit-bull terrier. Moss observes the dog, who eerily looks back at him with a sort of knowing sense of what bloodshed and chaos comes with what he's just run away from: 'Trust me, it's not worth it' seems to be the exclamation. At the site, made more shocking by the presence of bullet ridden mutts, Moss waltz's through a barren patch of land inhabited by dead drug dealers, automatic weaponry and shot-up trucks. A few hundred yards off is a few million dollars in cash, which he swipes after appearing to confront himself with the question. A distant storm begins to break, with feint cracks of thunder – the bag that contained the money is beginning to double up as Pandora's box.The film's immediate opening is a voice over uttered by a man that has seen better days. His comments, recollections and opinions on life and the world is juxtaposed by some fantastic Texas scenery. Bell talks of the old times, and how some sheriffs in the past barely drew their gun as there was so little crime – just 35 minutes in sees Bell's deputy, who's just a kid in comparison, drawing his gun to enter a potentially dangerous property. Bell's reaction to this is fascinating. The beauty of the locale shooting suggests that the man still loves his home area and the place in which he has spent his whole life, but looks on with concern; that times change and people have to change with them otherwise they'll be left behind. What follows this knowing observation, the film's central theme of making sense of it all, is a brutal murder - the first of many Chigurh will commit. The Coen's thrust you into the centre of Chigurh's world with this killing, setting up the white-knuckle ride and getting across this guy's cold efficiency; something that is put in contrast with Moss' earlier inability to take his time, take aim and shoot a nonthreatening wild animal.While widely accepted as one of the greatest screen villains from recent years, Chigurh is a collection of very basic but very effective things. Predominantly, his uncanniness is born out of his weapons of choice; those being a stun gun later established to exist so as to kill livestock painlessly as well as a standard pump action shotgun that comes complete with a silencer, thus creating an odd metallic whooshing noise when fired. His sly and sporadic use of ambiguous quotes and metaphors combine with his ruthless ability to play games and con those around him, out of methods of transportation or whatever. The scene in mind that sticks out most is the initial 'call it' exchange at a petrol station, during which odd shaped pieces of material are lined up behind the supposed victim; all of which are in the shape of a crude noose suggesting impending death, doom or execution.The film is violent, but the attention to the repercussions of violence are what makes it seem more gruesome than it is. When characters get injured later on, they need to treat themselves and this focus is ten times more nasty and more effective than, for instance, lining up nothing characters in a Saw sequel and lopping their limbs off. The film is so very visceral in its attention to sound; the build ups to two motel exchanges between certain characters is arguably more exciting than the following action sequences with light switches, floor boards, cocked guns and distant telephone tones all playing their part. With a sense of humour running throughout that is as dry as those rough, dusty early desert scenes and a fantastically structured narrative revolving around this man Moss; the decisions he makes and how they affect those around him and who he loves, No Country for Old Men is a stunning film and one of the best of recent times.",10,3,6,2 December 2009
District 9," Creative and involving film unfolding within this dystopian world full of aggression and hatred as an individual with a set task and existence is put through a wringer.
","District 9 is an exciting, raw and unflinching South African science fiction film; a piece that you feel is the result of years of studious work and hard graft finally come-good, work that has consequently broken into the world stage. If there was a reason to feel as if one was beginning to trawl through the latter stages of the The Lord of the Rings trilogy, whilst at the mercy of New Zealand born director Peter Jackson, then it might very well have been so that one might be able to observe District 9 some years later. The reason for the mentioning of Jackson and his trilogy of yester-year is that, by way of a South African film maker named Neill Blomkamp, whom himself with District 9 has revisited a 2005 short entitled Alive in Joburg, is that Jackson green-lit the bigger, broader project; consequently turning it into a smart; intelligent; engrossing sci-fi which is only mainstream entertainment in appearance but is also something far more interesting. With District 9; Blomkamp has shown himself to be a filmmaker able to run on ideas and creativity born out of his own mind, but apparently to be able to execute these ideas with an ability to draw in a mass audience; when linking him to other directors born out of the former British Empire, one might very much mention him in the same breath as his apparent mentor here in Peter Jackson or, and time will tell, even someone like James Cameron.But how does the film differ to any other space invaders-come-aliens landing from outer space piece? In the past, where intergalactic species have sought to destroy without mercy nor apparent reason; District 9 offers an eerily similar premise to proceedings but with an eye on developing this as a subplot around which their basing on planet Earth for twenty five odd years has already happened. A key scene from 1996's spectacle favouring, flag waving science fiction film Independence Day had a scene in which the incoming beasties inadvertently revealed their plan to us; one that revolved around going from planet to planet wiping out all traces of life, after which the rightful reaction ought to be: 'that just sounds a little bit......rubbish'. If ever there was a revisionist incoming beasties sci-fi action film in which said creatures felt, hurt and had personalities then District 9 is it. Although that statement itself raises a paradox some have brought about through 1990's Dances With Wolves, that while the Native Americans are deconstructed as the lead spends more time with them, the blood thirsty Apaches draw the short straw and stay as such. Most of the other aliens in this are these apparent dead brained, bug like creatures with an apparent ability for inter-galactic travel but remain quite primitive in attitudes and ideologies.The film sees a huge ship hover above Johannesburg, South Africa in 1982; a mission to board it revealing a near-dying breed of tall bug-like creatures whom are brought back to Earth and just placed out of the way in a slum. The script has fun with a more American infused attitude to this material, faux interviewees telling us it didn't happen to land over a large American city and that expecting 'bright, flashing lights' wasn't out of the question in what it a reference to Spielberg's Close Encounters film; itself a piece about aliens arriving without initial intent to annihilate. Cut to September 2010, and the extraction of the now proclaimed 'prawns' from this ghetto is to be headed up by a certain Wikus Van De Merwe (Copley), nothing more then a desk jobber at the MNU organisation charged with infiltrating the slum with weapons wielding law enforcers and clearing them out to a new zone, of which is later referred to by Wikus as resembling a concentration camp. In Wikus, and later his cohort in a prawn named Christopher Johnson, is a thoroughly nourishing character study. The po-faced pacifist Wikus talks goofily into the camera the faux-documentary crew film him with as they follow him around extraditing the Prawns, as more battle hardened; trigger happy law enforcers seem content to shoot first, ask questions later. After years of Apartheid rule, blacks and whites-alike are now seemingly aligned with one another in battering and turfing out a new breed of organism in the most merciless possible fashion. Didn't anybody learn anything?The joy is in following Wikus' plight as he finds himself away from a previously well protected, bubbled existence, and accidentally sprays himself with a fluid Johnson had been storing in his shack, something that brings about the 'Prawnification' for that of whom it sprays, and the consequential falling apart of his life and alienation from his loving wife. Wikus' po-faced appearance gradually gives way as his body mutates and a visual sense of weary, bearded dishevelment settles in as he stands up to arms dealers and sheds his previous office laden image; a literal suiting up into this metallic, one man army suit nearer the end signalling the ultimate in this transition. Suddenly, solace can only be found in the Prawns and those he worked with, in the MNU, are after him for all sorts of sordid testing; the places of the respective characters' dwelling a routine but effective item used to highlight the distinction between the two: a plated shack and a large detached house. The film's premise and plot ideas revolving around chase and epiphanies are pretty standard, but are given leases of life and fresh interest through this lens of creativity. The film's antagonist is corruption: the enemies its lying media and conniving government with whom it operates; a skin headed, sadism revelling fascist mercenary taking the reigns as a physical villain towards the end; culminating in an unflinching look at a world full of hatred and rejection, in which the joy is watching people finding their psychological state torn and their physical identity in a disturbing process of transition.",7,0,7,6 August 2010
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," We may know how it ends, but perhaps the biggest achievement of the piece is the manner in which director Dominik makes us forget how it does with a stunning study.
","There is an underlying and quite eerie sense of substance in Andrew Dominik's 2007 film The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, the kind that is linked to the fact it is a study of an individual's obsession with a celebrity; a lust to be like a certain other, no matter how infamous or hated they may be. Here is a film with a central idea; a central study that is executed wonderfully well, with a slow burning and alluring approach which compliments the slow and steady delving into obsession. Simply put, it's great to look at; wonderful to watch and by the end, rather frightening.The film, whose central study is got across in one brilliant scene, looks at what is an unhealthy fondness of someone who has got to a relative pinnacle of a career by way of murder; robbery and bullying. In what might be the film's best scene, we encounter the outlaw Jesse James (Pitt) in a bath tub – at his most raw, at his most vulnerable and at his most revealing. At the entrance to the bathroom stands the proclaimed 'coward', Robert Ford (Affleck), and they exchange words before James poses him the question around which the study revolves: 'Do you want to be like me, or actually BE me?' Here is an exchange in which James, in his rawest of forms, challenges Ford's ideologies to do with an unnatural fondness and makes us aware, that he himself is aware, that he might carry a certain aura about him.The film documents James from 1881 to 1882, while incorporating any feats, robberies and murders that unfolded at that time on a twin parallel with Ford's gradual coming to terms with the fact this idolisation exists within him. The entire piece is narrated by a certain Hugh Ross, adding an interesting ingredient on top of an already interesting study. The inclusion of a narrator initially felt, at least to me, unwarranted or perhaps un-needed. Whatever tale or recalling of events that needed to play out didn't necessarily strike me as the sort that required narration from an agent uninvolved. But I think the inclusion is merited when you link it to the overall picture; that fact the film might be seen as a lecture, or a warning of sorts, of this sort of intrigue and obsession with violence in the media and aspiration to become someone, or someone of similar ilk, whom isn't a particularly good role model.But that's not to say the film talks down to us. It very cleverly distances us from unfolding the film from either of one of the two lead's points of view. We see this from a third person perspective; someone not directly involved in the text which feeds off two people, one of which is a hardened and rather nasty outlaw while the other is a young man whom comes complete with stalker-like tendencies and an unnatural fondness for a national villain. During one scene set around a dinner table in Ford's home, James sits amidst the rest of the family as tensions flair. But the film additionally seems to like the notion that Jesse James might act as an alter-ego to the rest of Ford's family, as well as the American Dream in general. He sits there, almost as some sort of a visualisation of an amoral manner in which to garner attention, money, fame and, ultimately, admirers. This, twinned with whatever conflict going on between James and Ford, adds a certain extra layer of antagonism between James and the Fords.As the film nears its conclusion and the inevitable nears, certain flashbacks see Jesse refer to himself in the third person sense as some kind of overwhelming anxiety and an aspect of suicidal ideation begins to overcome him. We are given his point of view, a rarity up to this point as the film provides us with a blurred and wide angled lens as he stares out of a window giving off a very uncanny sense of dread and a delicate mindset coming close to crumbling down. The film finishes what it starts in a true and engaging manner. The epilogue and Ford's supposedly newfound celebrity status following the shooting of James brings him nothing but misery, and he never, ever – as the voice over states, comes anywhere near replicating the aura nor fame James had when he was at his peak of 'celebrity' status. What was an unhealthy obsession, quickly turned into a realisation and then into an unhealthy groove of trivialisation and guilt. Ford gave himself the big build up, latched onto the wrong beliefs and paid for it, and this film is an impressive documentation of that process.",7,1,2,16 July 2009
Tigerland," Shot, written and acted in a way that is superb.
","In Joel Schumacher, you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time. But this is common knowledge; I think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time, failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur. Hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror/thriller; Chaplin liked his comedy; Scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and Spielberg likes his large scale, big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids. Other more obscure examples include Kubrick and Welles who covered too much to write about here.But Schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise. Falling Down had a great idea behind it but I found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy. Batman is a superhero; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me. Then comes 8MM; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before Tigerland which is Schumacher's best film from what I've so far seen, in my opinion. With the war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time. I can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the D-Day landings during Saving Private Ryan: at the time when I first saw the film, I had not much knowledge of the Second World War bar when it began and finished. My eyebrows were up, my mouth slightly open with a weak 'I can't believe it smile' on my face. Needless to say, it was because of that film I searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole. In Tigerland, you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through Bozz (Farrell), a tough and egotistical soldier training for the Vietnam War.But what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time. The things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school. Tigerland may borrow from Full Metal Jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the Vietnam War but egos and superegos play more of a part here, I think. The superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against Bozz whose ego is extremely large. There is also the third part of Freud's triangle that sneaks into Bozz: the ID. Compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos, Bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself: 'You are all dead in this situation!' barks a sergeant. 'Any Questions?' 'Yeah, if I'm dead how come I can ask a question?' replies Bozz whose punishments such as push-ups and dirt eating seem to un-faze him in true ID style; that is he enjoys the punishments.Also regarding the superegos, Bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training. This is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell Bozz he is in charge. What follows is an actual conversation between Bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his Christian name. This is where Private Wilson's (Whigham) character steps in: His uncontrollable rage and anger at Bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river. Wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward Bozz and acts out.What I also liked about Tigerland is that it's shot in such a way that is brave. While lacking in innovation, Tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look. Make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness. But, we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for TV; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but Schumacher is clever: he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was. It's worth saying here that Spielberg said he wanted Saving Private Ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes.While being very funny and entertaining, Tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute. Its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier. There are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy, if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military.",8,1,3,8 January 2008
Batman Begins," Nolan's re-jigging of a popular item that had certainly become something set in a particular mould, is involving; brooding and quite exciting.
","Batman Begins finishes with its lead character telling one of his allies, with whom he has forged a steady and precise friendship, that he'll 'look into it' when handed a suspicious looking playing card in an evidence bag; a verbal promising to stay on alert for the near-future when it's made aware an individual, a foe of sorts, may shortly be in need of being dealt with. The exchange at the very end is significant for two reasons, one of which is that the dialogue sequence between the lead and his ally calls to mind the previous Batman film and an odd exchange between the exact same two characters when played by different people. In 1998's Batman & Robin, Chief of police Commissioner Jim Gordon informs Batman in the most obvious, most expositional, most theatrical of manners that '....a new villain has arrived, and he calls himself Mr. Freeze!'. After the emotional and weighty roller-coaster we've been on throughout the duration of Batman Begins, this small exchange between the two at the very end does not bother us; it feels like a genuine exchange of pleas and ideas between two people we believe understand each other. Secondly, the item of 'looking'; the film has just spent two or so hours looking into the past of a troubled individual and the source of both his pain and inspiration before guaranteeing to advance to the future in terms of noting what needs to be done.In short, the film is an interesting and somewhat enthralling little mood piece that combines a number of ideas and film-making aspects to produce something rather worthwhile, which is significant given the genre. From the stretches of the childhood of the titular character's alter-ego in Bruce Wayne right the way through to attempting to keep law and order on the hostile, night-set streets of Gotham City by way of the isolated mountains of the Far East; Batman Begins is a focused and engaging detailing of an angry and chequered young man finding his way in life. Wayne is played by Christian Bale, in one of those roles of his that see him take the predominant reigns and dominate the screen with a credible performance without having to act as a foil to someone else of whom usually does a better job. Wayne's life sees him inhabit a world full of crime and poverty in the aforementioned Gotham City; a place that is bright and vibrant during his childhood as his father and owner of Wayne Enterprises takes travels with him on trains and mostly reassures that everything will be alright, in the end.As he grows in age, the place is darker; more hostile and more threatening, a tone that director Christopher Nolan shifts when, upon leaving an opera early one night, his parents are shot in-front of him by a mugger. Consequently, Wayne's childhood demons are born out of it and the guilt that one assumes comes with the desire to have left prematurely painfully manifests. This, as one other event in which, after falling through a hole in the Wayne manor grounds and down an old shaft, a flurry of bats swarmed over him act as key triggers during the man's childhood. Wayne's first taste of justice is the sequence in which he's told, as a young boy by a police officer, that the mugger is caught. Years later, and after spending time in prison, the mugger is released and gunned down by a bystander before Wayne gets a chance to do so himself; thus being able to witness the results of a negative channeling of anger. His reaction to the shooting is the final perverse frill to the sort of activity just witnessed, and the symbolic casting away of the pistol he was going to use is an interesting rejection of firearms and vigilantism by way of murder.Batman Begins uses its villain's goal as a secondary point of interest to the story of how Bruce Wayne became Batman, a plot linked to the intoxication of the city's water supply does not come across as daft as it sounds; the idea headed by a certain psychiatric doctor named Jonathan Crane (Murphy) who runs a local asylum and goes by the alias of Scarecrow. The film links the villain to Batman by way of Crane's lust to project fear onto the criminals of Gotham. Crane instills it into them, on whom he illegally experiments in his asylum by way of an odd hallucinogenic gas-like substance, rather than projecting fear onto them; an idea stated by Batman himself who is driven to make those that deserve it fear what he fears. Crane's appearance is preceded by Wayne's own strange and somewhat visceral confronting of his fear of bats down in a cave, a demonstration that he's made the final steps into a new realm of overcoming his fears before his first test makes its presence known.Wayne is flanked by mentor Henri Ducard (Neeson), a rugged character whom rejects certain clichéd traits in forming his own view on events and characters within; Rachel Dawes (Holmes), a strong and free thinking district attorney whom holds her own in a male dominated world as well as his faithful butler Alfed (Caine), whose proverbs and sporadic pick-me-up tidbits have infuriated me in the past although not here; as Nolan uses them to suggest a sense of soul, exemplified in the sequence the pair of them attempt to escape a ravaging fireball above them by plummeting down a makeshift elevator into the custom built Batcave. Alfred's motivational statement is not off the cuff, but a link to the tribulations of a cowering infantile Wayne as they thunder down a shaft; the very action Wayne himself suffered when he was younger prior to his morbid fear first rearing its head. In combining the cut-and-thrust sensibility of 2000's Memento and the intensity plus attention to character from 2002's Insomnia, Nolan has produced a winner.",7,0,0,5 June 2010
Wreck-It Ralph," Fun and engaging animation rich in comedy; adventure and dregrees of nostalgia.
","I am just about old enough to remember arcades and arcade machines themselves - there was an 'Outrun' situated beside a 'Michael Jackson's Moonwalker' near the reception desk of my local sports and leisure centre back in the mid 90's. Upstairs, in another the corridor, there was a 'Pac-Man' game. On one particular holiday, an outlet known as 'SegaWorld' was situated not five minutes away around the corner of a hotel we were staying at. This was the only real video gaming arcade I think I ever visited: it was a vast, open gaming utopia of bleeping noises; flashing lights and huge screens. Shooting games would have in-built guns pointing at the screen, driving games ('Daytona USA') would allow you to sit behind a wheel and actually simulate driving around the track. I distinctly recall being wowed by the fact multiple people could engage in the same race at once on different screens. That sounded like the most fun anyone could ever have doing anything.Not very long after all of this, Sony released their first 'Playstation' console and there was not, I do not think, really a reason to go back to arcades - I strain to recall going back to one after having obtained a Playstation myself, and I distinctly recall the arcade machines at my local leisure centre having vanished certainly by 2000. I can only guess no one was playing them anymore - Sega and Nintendo of course had certain consoles out when arcades were much bigger, but Sony just seemed to have seen the arcade off for good. All of which brings us to 'Wreck-it Ralph', an actually quite infectious animation in the mould of 'Toy Story', with spits and spots of 'Last Action Hero' and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' thrown in for good measure, about video game characters who live in arcade machines and operate within their own little universe parallel to our own. Like 'Toy Story', they have their own rules and regulations on keeping everything a secret - it's a little more serious in this film because if game characters start misbehaving too badly, their arcade machine is shut down and wheeled off thus terminating everybody in the game. 'Work' is to fulfil what your character is meant to do within the confines of a given game - ANY game - and then chilling out in the evening ready for the next day. Sometimes, they use electricity cables to traverse to communal places, or even one another's games.John C. Reilly voices the eponymous Ralph, the villain in a fictitious arcade game from the 1980's entitled 'Fix-it Felix', which still somehow manages to pull in the punters amidst all the cool new games. Ralph, however, wants change - he's tired of being the villain and is a little depressed on account of being rejected by the other characters in the 'Fix-it' game, whom will quite happily invite one of the Super Mario Brothers to a house-party, but never Ralph. Going against all the rules, Ralph bolts from the game in search of a medal, which he believes will win him the appreciation of the game's other characters given his nemesis Felix is showered in them every day for winning the very game Ralph must attempt to thwart. Facing oblivion should Ralph not return, Felix (Jack McBrayer) converses with the other characters of 'Fix-it' and decides to follow him into a game resembling a combination of 'Mario Kart' and those candy themed levels from 'Mickey Mouse's Castle of Illusion' so as to drag him back... Eventually, events unfold whereby Ralph is wrapped up in a mission that threatens much more than his mere popularity. What is most impressive about the film is, aside from its dazzling visuals and really quite wonderful idea of creating a universe for video gaming characters to all co-exist, its sense of adventure and the careful characterisation it provides to an array of made-up video gaming entities, of whom cane be little; large; tough-talking; softly spoken; kooky; wacky and just plain homicidal - all of which creates a wonderful palette. Thrown in for good measure is a sweet romance sub-plot Felix has with a gun-toting action heroine from a 'Halo' style shooter named Calhoun (Jane Lynch), which I assume was partly designed to highlight the progression female characters have undergone in video-games over three decades. The film's director, Rich Moore, has a background in working with people like Matt Groening on 'Futurama' and 'The Simpsons', and so is more than adept at delivering fast-moving, joke-riddled cartoons which are often very funny and seem to be about complete nonsense, but actually have very carefully defined boundaries that keep them from being such a thing.I think much of one's enjoyment of the film will derive from whether or not you can recall heading down to arcades and having a blast on a game, either with a friend or on your own. For many, those memories originate from childhood anyway and so there can be a really pleasing clash of nostalgia with the freshness of seeing an unseen adventure. The film is much more than mere visuals and effects, and certainly, the way everything is reigned in and brought together for the finale, is more than just slightly impressive. It isn't difficult to recommend 'Wreck-it Ralph'.",7,0,0,21 August 2018
Before Sunset," An impressive addition to Before Sunrise as Linklater proves once again that he has what it takes when a script is needed to carry a film.
","I purposely waited over a space of about 11 months in-between viewing Before Sunrise and Before Sunset (they were after all made nine years apart) in order to create some sort of feeling; some sort of atmosphere; some sort of reaction. Although this tactic required patience and tolerance, I feel it actually worked in a way. What made it a reality is when you first get a glimpse of the character of Celine (Delpy) and then Jesse's (Hawke) hilarious reaction. I myself recently met up with someone who means rather a lot to me; I hadn't seen her for the best part of a year and although our rendezvous was actually planned; Before Sunset's encounter really was all about the girl seeking out the guy and surprising him in the shop so although I can't relate to Jesse's surprise as he wasn't expecting her; I can relate to his emotions of reunion.I mentioned in my review of Before Sunrise the feeling of luck and chance that was evident (and pretty much acted as the theme for the film) and also the atmosphere of 'fly on the wall' film-making  it was unlike anything I'd ever seen in an English speaking film before but Before Sunset feels more cinematic; it feels more like it's a film with a setting, characters and a script but I do not mean this as criticism it merely proves what a good director Linklater is when it comes to his own universe of films. If he had done what he did before with Before Sunset, he would have pretty much made the same film as he did nine years ago and that wouldn't have been good.What I liked about this film more than its elder brother is the feeling that we know the characters and I felt more settled with the exchanges flying to and fro. The characters repeat to one another what they've done in the nine years in-between films without actually showing it meaning you have to listen to catch up. This happens quite early on and thus; draws you in immediately as a film that's dialogue driven like this one has to have the audience hooked from the start and the back stories are a great piece of nostalgia; not only for the characters but also for us: the viewers who also want to know what's happened to them.When these two people talk, they deal with issues only people who know each other or have shared something very special together can talk about. In the first film; these issues that revolve around first loves, what you look for in a partner, etc. were dealt with in a rather colloquial manner that I found a little odd as they'd only really known each other for half an hour and had only met on a train through a chance encounter, but here it fits perfectly since they actually know, remember and probably love each other.The film makes good use of its location in Paris as it did in Before Sunrise with Vienna and it really doesn't seem like its only 77 minutes short. The long takes and nothing-ness dialogue make it so that it feels like the whole day goes past but again, this isn't a bad thing as it's 'this kind of film'. If you can look past the way the characters overreact nearer the end and some of the 'filla' in the script at various times; you'll find a film that comes close to adding a new definition to the genre of 'Romantic/Comedy'.",7,0,0,8 May 2007
Zulu," Solid war drama with plenty to get involved in.
","The outpost at Rourke's Drift was a mission, a locale not too dissimilar to what a hospital might look like - a place designed to house the God loving Christian, the sick, the ill, the frail – the weak. It's no surprise that Cy Endfield's 1964 war film Zulu is as good as it is, the whole things has this vulnerable, weak and frail atmosphere about it whenever its depicting scenes in and around this base. When the time comes for a few thousand strong indigenous Zulu force to hit them with mostly everything they've got, as well as a little more in the form of rifles they've acquired along the way, it's little surprise you watch the chaos unfold from behind your hands. At the core of the warring and hostilities is a curious dynamic which, I think, has no doubt contributed to its watchability down the years: strength in numbers against strength in firepower; an invading force greatly outnumbering a surrounded force who're better equipped, but are stuck in one place.For all its fame and reputation of being a resounding film about triumph and against-the-odds victories, Zulu will open with a crushing British defeat. That is to say, it will open with the reporting of a crushing British defeat: the images of a burning carriage and its load put to a downcast voice over informing us of the bad news does not begin the film in a triumphant, resounding manner. The Zulus, then, are capable of such things; are capable of such victories, and our first sighting of them pushes them into this bracket of the unreal, of the uncanny – an eerie celebratory dance at their camp in the early evening with songs in a language few non-native people will have ever heard up to this point in history, almost placing them into a realm of the supernatural.Present at this ceremony, however, are a British preacher and his daughter; Endfield's way of visually contrasting just how unalike these two later warring factions really are. The Brits here are stiff and rigid in their sitting and watching, as if unable to look away out of being too transfixed or frightened or a mixture of both by what they see, where the Zulus jump and bounce around out in the open in a very animated fashion. The daughter knows very little of what she sees and must ask her father, who's expertise in these people is enough to answer her questions. This mixture of fear, ignorance and fascination that the white Brits have for these people is established to be present within these African-set circles very early and through this otherwise irrelevant pairing. Later, the film will explode into a procession of violence and warfare with these sorts of conflicts at the core of the warring.Not so far away at the aforementioned outpost are a group of about a hundred British soldiers, most of them injured or wounded in some fashion. Almost all of them are bored with this slow recovering process – these soldiers kill time with meagre games of shuffling cups in a random order after placing a bullet under one of them. These troops are not, however, stock filmic cannon fodder present so as to be blown apart later on: Endfield allows some of them to be friendly, others to be unkind; some are sexist, one or two of them are criminals - others even enjoying singing. At the core of them is Michael Caine's Lieutenant: Gonville Bromhead, a young man who's softly spoken; elegant and cuts an erect figure but will eventually traverse from such things to this frizzy haired, gunpowder stained character who bellows orders out to his troops in a way it didn't seem possible at the beginning of the film.When it becomes apparent an attack on their outpost might happen, Bromhead mentions some of his relatives from centuries ago and how their achievements in battle at respective places such as Waterloo and Quebec instills him with pride. To this extent, the film and its later warfare will carry more of a personalised air for Bromhead, as he tries to place himself in a similar bracket as those in his family that preceded him in proving his worth in battle. From some substantial beginnings arrives the assault, something which keeps getting worse and worse as one's sanctuary of being inside one of the few buildings is stripped away and the solider count is gradually eroded. The action and warfare wisely avoids falling into a trap that might see it labelled as 'exciting' – but it is a stupendous display of second unit spectacle interspersed by these diegetic chorus' sung by both sides, in what is an eerie instance of original score moving aside for internal music provided by the actual soldiers fighting within the scenes. As far as war films go, and with constructive character studies as well as a sense of film making prose at work, you could do a lot worse than Zulu.",7,1,4,18 April 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Terrifying and emotionally draining piece which places the viewer at the forefront of chaos, angst and deliberation in 1944 France.
","Saving Private Ryan is Spielberg's anti-thesis to the action movie, indeed the blockbuster ideology. From the man who made his name, indeed inspired a entire movement if you'd like to label the blockbuster so, in making 1975's Jaws; a film that skipped along the boundaries of comedy, horror and sheer action driven spectacle, comes a film that combines the latter two of those three and approaches them from a completely different angle. Whilst Spielberg-helmed; starring functional, friendly, relaxed and 'accessable' lead Tom Hanks; released in the summer month of July in America, but getting a more realised winter period release everywhere else and very much arriving as a genre film, Saving Private Ryan is anything but the usual summertime-Spielberg-Hanks led flick, instead turning a entire 'promise' into a thing of pure terror. In a summer that saw Deep Impact, Armeggeddon and Godzilla released in close proximity, Saving Private Ryan must have been quite the jolt.People have written in the past about the degrees of sentimentality and the nuisance to do with the unreliable narrator. I think it's impossible to look, or even think, back to the times of The Second World War without a sense of sentimentality. The notes that accompany the DVD state that Spielberg attempted to get across that orally guided sense of the father telling the child, ie; his father informing him of the horrors of the war. Such an approach, to some, might sound a little convention, indeed like a cliché, or something that contains a degree of sentimentality. Essentially, this is exactly what Spielberg does in Saving Private Ryan; he doesn't trivialise in rendering it TV movie of the week built around some harsh battle scenes, he delivers on a true-to-life narrative as told through the perspective of someone who wasn't there but is aware of the horrors, much in the way anybody born post WWII might attempt to re-imagine what it must have been like to fight under certain conditions.The film is, in fact, delivered by way of a flashback – a delving into the past a specific soldier does in order so that we may relive what occurred over the space of half a dozen or so days, echoing Spielberg's own relation to the war stories of old by way of his father. The film is about unity; teamwork and the risk of sacrifice those undertake for individuals they are yet to meet, for the platoon in Saving Private Ryan it is an individual they know is out there but in the grander scale of things, it is for people spanning a number of generations across a number of nations they will certainly never encounter.Following the flashback, Spielberg provides us with a few seconds of calm before the storm in the form of waves lapping up on a beach. The place is northern France, the event is D-Day in 1944. Much has been written about the landings, going into them would only repeat what has been said but it's worth noting that the first lines anybody ever says once all the vomiting and praying in the landing crafts has stopped arrives in the form of a load of military directions and ramblings which the viewer might not properly hear, enhancing confusion and a sense of disorientation just prior to the drawn out sequence of carnage. With this, and as pointed out in a review in a publication, the casting of Hanks as Captain John Miller gives the audience something to map onto amidst the chaos, as actors that do not carry similar weight to Hanks are either blown apart around him or placed in this Hellish cauldron. However, years later the likes of Pepper; Burns and Diesel have since established themselves as names and face thus threatening to dampen the intended purpose of anonymity Spielberg meant. Viewing it recently, I do not feel any of the impact is particularly lost.Their eventual mission to seek out the Private Ryan of the title, a certain Matt Damon, who's located somewhere pretty deep within northern France; deep enough so that the march there will last half a dozen or so days march for the troops. Miller's platoon is made up of the guys that survived with him on the beaches of D-Day plus a certain Private by name of Upham, a trilingual troop played by Jeremy Davies who does his usual scrawny; softly spoken; seemingly untrustworthy and somewhat ill-at-ease-with-everyone-else act which was fresher back then than it is now. Miller's professionalism is only enforced by talk of a highly dangerous, off screen mission he undertook; one that saw him and his crew knock out a number of German anti-air craft guns. Dennis Farina's somewhat impressed and therefore transfixed gaze locks onto a talking Miller, as the emphasis in his character's superiority in military activity is encored. He and his platoon's journey is punctuated by interactions with French families; German snipers; machine gun nests and conflicts with each other as they go in search.To say the film concludes with an almighty shoot-out between two sides in a bombed out and long since deserted French town, would be grossly misleading. In a sense, an action film might very well 'build' to an explosive and dramatic set piece but while Saving Private Ryan might conform to a series of heroic actions, followed by a twist in fate just as a fatal blow is about to be struck to whom we think is the 'lead', the lingering feeling is on the sense of loss more-so spectacle. One might argue the sequence comes across as more stark and more frightening than the opening beach landings simply because of the presence of the reason the platoon are even there; the fear of loss of life comes across as more prominent in a film that has thus far displayed a massive amount of loss. The film is a towering achievement, and one of the better films out of the decade that-was the 1990s.",10,2,4,1 February 2010
The Chorus," Wonderful and very watchable film about a teacher attempting to bring his own ideas and methods to a worn out establishment.
","From France comes a Christophe Barratier film named Les Choristes; or 'The Choir' as well as 'The Chorus' as it has been transcribed for British and American audiences, it would seem. The film is an uplifting tale, a realistic look at several pretty desperate situations for all parties involved, in a French boarding school a few years after The Second World War. The film looks at the struggles in life for several people of varying ages and roles, be they headmaster attempting to run the school; a male teacher whom arrives and is thus unacquainted and initially nervous before he attempts to bring his own ideas to the curriculum as well as several children themselves, all of whom are varying in their temperament and attitudes The Choir manages to spread its focus around these parties but uses the character of Clément Mathieu (Jugnot) as a central focus or viewpoint as the events and world around him unfolds. The film is, theoretically, one long flashback induced by an elderly man in the present day named Pépinot who went to said school with Pierre Morhange, someone who has since become a conductor of quite some considerable note. The story is unfolded through Mathieu's journal, something Pépinot has come into possession with.It would seem a lot of people complain about the giving away of Morhange being this world famous conductor, quite literally, in the very first few minutes. The idea is, following on from where Mathieu brings musical classes to everyone at the school's attention, we know that he must've done enough to inspire a very young boy to go on and become the conductor he is. I don't think it acts as too much of a bad thing and I think that, once the entering of the man's journal and the flashback proceeds, a different lead has taken the mantle and the film is, essentially, more of a study of one man and his quest to get this choir class set up and how he will overcome diversity as well as the problems he encounters. I will point at Carlito's Way (or most any other neo-noir in which the anti-hero should or would usually 'get' his comeuppance for living the life he did) which shows the lead of that film shot at point blank range in the first thirty seconds or so. What follows is a flashback; a tale about the tribulations and actual journey of how one gets to that point.On this basis, The Choir worked for me. I found Mathieu's story riveting and never overly sentimental or melodramatic as he just tried to inspire, educate and generally do what he wanted to do in the hope others may find it equally as fascinating and/or enjoyable. I am not a teacher myself but is this not what every teacher of any subject at any level just generally tries to do? When Mathieu initially arrives, the film balances its tone of light comedy and effective drama while establishing the sort of character Mathieu is and what lies ahead. There is a scene where a child is guilty of whatever offence and since no one knows who did it, Mathieu must pick a boy at random to be punished as he does not know any of them. He is reluctant but must go through with the situation; regretful when he sees the seemingly harmless boy he's selected for punishment and later apologetic. The school means business, the children can sometimes step out of line but Mathieu will not be moved or change his ways for either.Initially, the children are something to fear. Their shouts and running echoes eerily through the corridors and the nasty results of a practical joke still remain on one member of staff thus preparing our lead for what awaits him but little do any of them know at the time of what changes will occur once initial contact is made. As a character, Mathieu is in a natural position of control as a teacher over the children but is more understanding as a super-egotistical element of the school, offering to introduce his own classes complete with content against the wishes of other staff. He himself answers to the headmaster named Rachin (Berléand), an individual who believes, and consequently has everyone else believe, that 'action, reaction' is the best form of education; a sort of 'solve violence with violence' ideation so that if they step out of line, you give them a good smack and hope they don't do it again.But what Mathieu sees is that they need something to exercise their minds; a common interest he can perhaps implant within them that brings them all together and, somehow, enables everyone to just have something in common with everyone else  that thing is singing. It breeds a common ground between teacher and pupil, something everyone can do in tandem and at once. Despite some snotty reactions, The Choir is worth the time for anyone searching out an engaging film that looks at triumph over incorrect beliefs as an individual tries to bring their own ideas to the plate and construct interests set at a time in which the very nation of France was in a state of disorientation and rebuilding themselves.",8,0,0,12 March 2009
The Pianist," Stupendous story told through an equally impressive film.
","That first scene where Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) plays in the recording suite, in Warsaw, for the Polish radio station sums up not only the entire film but Szpilman's dedication and attitude towards his music and his ability to play music. He is sitting there, live on air, as bombs rain down on the city before one hits the building he is in. People are starting to panic behind a soundproof window but it is a suspenseful panic because whilst we in the studio can see the panic and stress the disc jockey is going through, we are tantalisingly put on hold in terms of the horror of the attack. Then a bomb hits the studio room we're in and we wake up to what's happening, as does Szpilman. He must stop playing after previously continuing.The next time Szpilman plays the piano in a war zone where his life is threatened will be the crescendo for not only the Second World Wartime journey of horror Szpilman must endure, but also for the last time danger is that close to him as is a piano. There are scenes in the film where he is so close to a piano and yet playing it would result in his quick demise; but he is strong enough and powerful enough to be able to remember the music and play on through his mind  that adds extra importance to that near-the-end wartime scene when he must play with 'danger' watching on.The film begins and ends in Poland, during the Second World War and we are taken through the various stages of horror imposed by the invading Nazi Germans during their assault on most of mainland Europe. The film's opening third acts not too much like a documentary that might shovel the message: 'The Germans were evil people' down our throats and not too much like an over the top experimental art film. I read that the film is European produced which should come as no surprise because its aesthetic is very much that of realism, the dominant European aesthetic. So we learn of one family's struggle through the days of the Nazi rule and the film presents us with a hierarchy of Nazi invoked violence. There are the initial scenes of humiliation as a man must walk in the gutter for the crime of being Jewish but there is also the equally awkward to watch as I'm sure it was to shoot scene at a cross roads when Jewish strangers must dance together. From here, the levels are cranked up further and further and it's not long before stone cold violence is being presented to us.But The Pianist is much more than a realistic take on Polish struggles at this time with a few scenes inter-cut to show some atrocity. The film is a breath of fresh air and suggest to me that Roman Polanski has viewed previous Second World War film efforts and corrected them where he thinks corrections should be made. Not a fan of Saving Private Ryan for its lack of mentioning other Allies? Well, Polanski takes time out here for his characters to mention the British and the French over the radio they listen to. Squeamish enough to look away from heavy violence in Second World War films but maintain an interest in the subject anyway? Well here, Polanski shoots his action and his violence in such a way that just these scenes alone go a long way in helping label him an 'auteur'.These scenes and shots are littered throughout the film and contain a certain point of view thinking behind them. For instance, when later on in the film there is guerrilla fighting between Germans and ghetto inhabitants, we always see the action from Szpilman's perspective that is to say the camera never cuts to ground level to show the violence or to try and sell it as entertainment. All we know is that one side is over there, one is over here and they fight; another touch being that for most of the time we do not see the rebels or where they shoot from but we do hear the gunfire. Likewise, when a German soldier is hit the camera never cuts to that level to confirm us the kill  everything is done in point of view format from the window and is kept that way. This gives a scene when Szpilman is actually on the ground level and close to a corpse of a woman he saw get shot a few days ago an extra bite because now we are closer to the kill, it is our first proper look at the result of a gunfight that has been and gone  our conscience and awareness catches up with us.And this tactic is used by Polanski more than once. When a crippled Jew is thrown from his balcony, we see it from the Szpilman's window but when Jews are executed by way of the gun, we are helplessly trapped on that ground level and must witness the atrocity, partly because Szpilman is not there watching from afar in his home or from a window. The added disturbance for these kills is that the cripple cannot defend himself and the fact the officer must reload his gun  also notice how each Jew lying down has their own way of dealing with the inevitable: some keep their face down on the floor but others look ahead giving everything added tragedy. The Pianist works on many levels of storytelling and informs as well as shocks without relying on neatly plotted stories  it is a war fought between superpowers told from the point of view of someone who is not a superpower, and the result is brilliant.",8,2,3,5 May 2008
28 Days Later...," Shocks; scares; an excellent attitude to horror as a genre and some excellent character observations render 28 Days Later one of the greats.
","The streets are empty; the nation is crumbling, with cities either deserted or on fire; whatever event that has rendered the enemies of the film of the uncanny variety has been unleashed; only a small band of human survivors remain and nobody seems to have much of a plan. So arrived in cinemas back in 2002 a relatively familiar premise for a horror film, to be shot on digital video and staring a ragtag bunch of unfamiliar acting talent attempting to get across the raw fear and sensations of finding oneself in this predicament. The film was helmed by Englishman Danny Boyle; who was getting back to scuzzy, low level based pictures much in the vein of his earlier feature Trainspotting, this following the bleached out and visually alluring 2000 effort The Beach. It's to everyone's great credit that 28 Days Later holds up as one of my favourite horror films, and one of my favourite overall films of the decade.With a 2007 sequel following it; a cast of actors who have since gone on to bigger and richer things as well as a director who has consequently churned out equally nourishing film-going experiences in Sunshine and Slumdog Millionaire, revisiting 28 Days Later after however long it's been is strangely humbling. Set on the 'diseased, decaying island', as one character calls it, that is Britain; 28 Days Later gets across scares; knows when to provide the sequences of gore; is able to provide an adequate number of suspenseful set-pieces; knows how to pace and where to place its scenes of terror and realisation of the overall situation while its instances of comedy and attention to character are equally seamlessly woven in.The film carries a very broad, quite epic feel to it. While similar in genre and premise, the film is the polar opposite to something like 2002's Resident Evil, or that respective film's first sequel. For all the money and gimmicks thrown at the screen in those films, what with their vast and expansive underground laboratory locales; lots of attention to fight scene aesthetics; inclusion of all things scientific and 'smart' sounding; nonsense narratives that flesh out into company cover-ups and so on, 28 Days Later works ten times as better with its stripped down and simplistic sense. It's to Boyle's great credit he achieves this with limited money and a shooting format more akin to student pieces than feature films due for cinematic release are. All the film does in vacate a location; spread a few discarded props here and there and bingo: you've got something is so simple yet so effective.The film begins with found footage of riots; if we go into the film with knowledge of the premise, we might feel a little underwhelmed at the use of such footage to 'act' as a representation that the 'zombies' are taking over and that the world is falling apart. But no, these are VT's being pumped into the minds of chimps as a new 'rage' virus is tested in a science lab somewhere in England. Animal activists, however, have different ideas and when an infected chimp gets out – all Hell breaks loose. When we first see Irish protagonist Jim (Murphy), he is lying stark naked on a hospital bed, all by himself, with wires and tubes coming out of him from every which way. Jim's progression from vulnerable and somewhat pathetic looking individual; to hospital cloak-clad scavenger; to naive 'infected' thwarter; to someone who gets a grip on the situation, is developed flawlessly by Boyle in the opening half an hour or so. Jim's initial contact with an 'infected' sees him take an instinctive swipe at it – it's an instinctive trait that'll see him survive to the best of his ability. The study of Jim and his progression into a bigger and more brutal character is one of the film's many sequences of well observed substantial passages linked to character.28 Days Later knows how to stop and it knows how to slow down in order give its characters room to breath and time to absorb their situation. Rather than opt for Resident Evil's kinetic energy, during which no one in the audience ever really feels as if any of the characters are in any danger of any kind, the film is driven by characters and their decisions. One is a male Irish lead and the other is his black, of Carribbean descent, female equal. She is Selena (Harris), a tough; hard-bodied; machete wielding foil to Jim whom saves his life twice and is begged a third time on a flight of stairs to do so again. We don't figure Selena to have been like this prior to the apocalypse, so a great deal has already happened to get her to this point. She is only ever really 'put in her place' when encountering figures whom represent the anti-thesis of feminism; that is to say, archetypes who want her to serve as someone that is useful for merely cooking and reproducing, as the re-population of Britain begins again from a disturbingly primitive starting point.Regarding these types, those that drive the final third, their presence meekly calls to mind that somewhat interesting theory which I'm told inhabited James Cameron's 1986 film Aliens; that of the monsters being of one 'sort' of evil whereas certain human-beings representing another. In 28 Days Later, those that display levels of intellect or oppositional ideologies are shunned as the aforementioned ideas of a woman's 'rightful' role in the world are played out as well – it all builds to a frightening climax. What with all this fascinating attention to character, role and predicament; Boyle remembers its genre cinema he's dealing with here and offers a number of scares and shocks anyway, giving the film a rounded sense. The film presents us with a familiar premise, but it's executed with such punch and such freshness that results in it just coming across as superb.",9,2,3,3 December 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Much more cluttered, far less enjoyable dinosaur island romp loosely trying expand on the first but also head in fresh directions - it just ends up blunt and uninteresting.
","Author Edwin Page has American director Quentin Tarantino quoted as saying, upon the 1997 release of Jackie Brown - his third film, that after being asked how he would go about 'topping' his preceding release Pulp Fiction, Tarantino replied that he didn't think he would, and thus tried 'deliberatley' to go 'underneath' his 1994 crime film masterwork; to try and undercut what was a large-and-in-charge genre piece with something a little subtler and a little more underplayed but both equally as substantial and enthralling. It's too bad Spielberg's Jurassic Park sequel came out as early on in the calender year of 1997 as it did, since a similar train of thought needs to be applied to it; the film, a mouthful in itself entitled The Lost World: Jurassic Park, wanting to go bigger and better than that of its 1993 blockbuster counterpart with larger clumps of characters; more monsters and a heavy later reliance on off-the-wall content which isn't even set on dystopian islands as much as it comes across as the director patting himself on the back for being able to pay homage to Godzilla.Returning from the first film is Jeff Goldblum's doctor of mathematics Ian Malcolm, a man now riding subways to meet with the entrepreneur of the last film's titular Jurassic Park, John Hammond (Attenborough), at his stately home home rather than travelling with said gentleman on helicopters to touch down on tropical paradises rich with the latest scientific breakthroughs. Times are tough for Malcolm, his whistle blowing on what happened in the first film has people ignominiously confront or stare at him, whilst his funding from certain institutes has been cut due to these ill received tales. The company predominantly behind Hammond's enterprise, InGen, appear to be taking over; their grey suits and blunt tones replacing that of the kindly elderly man act Hammond fronts for the organisation, as we observe him worn and somewhat frail.The reason for Malcolm's summoning lies with the fact a second site of dinosaurs and such is becoming a nuisance, a second site verbally established as this locale less secure than that of the first film's and much more dangerous; a place Hammond desires Malcolm to venture toward so as to lay claim to it prior to InGen's newfound fondness to exploit. He is only convinced upon discovering girlfriend Sarah Harding, played by Julianne Moore, has already gone there by herself. A scene in a large warehouse full of technology and equipment is meant to help quell fears of these characters not being able to deal with the dinosaur threat, a threat put across during the film's very first scene in which a child wonders from her rich, holidaying family and is mauled by some of the smaller beasties the result of this second site – that sense of the yet unseen larger ones probably capable of a lost worse prominent.Malcolm is stuck with an infant of his own, that of Kelly (Lee Chester), whom came about as the result of his Lothario nature he established himself to possess in the first film. He has a rift with Kelly - like the Alan Grant character and his problem with children in the first film, there is a brief alluding to how they cannot quite connect with one another, and we are lead into wondering if what later transpires within their collative quest will help quell that. We are correct to, but it isn't evident enough throughout the film to actually amount to anything special, and certainly isn't enough in the way of character substance to carry the picture. Goldblum's character is the audience's beacon of recognition once everyone is on the island. Around him are nobodies in the form of his underexposed daughter and two nothing supporting acts in photographer Nick (Vaughn) and weapons expert Eddie (Schiff). Goldblum, a veteran of the first film in the mould of what we are, provides warnings and reiterations toward the supporting acts-plus their sense of being awestruck upon first seeing the prehistorical creatures. These are humorous and self reflective of how easily we were once caught up in the first film and its respective bringing to life of these creatures prior to being caught out by the terror of it all.The film is a mostly underwhelming experience, an exercise in second unit direction that does not carry the wonder of the first nor the sense of craft at work which was wholly evident during the first film. Not long after InGen's own team have arrived with pomp and circumstance does the film wane; Eddie's justification that he doesn't want to shoot a dinosaur threatening one of his own team out of the fact it's protecting its young in stark contrast to InGen's ravaging of certain dinosaur hordes for their own prerogatives. One set piece sees Spielberg manage to riff on the first film too much in one go to keep the film feeling distanced enough from its 1993 cousin, a set piece in which the mud and the rain and the dark act as backdrops to a hapless character trying to tie a tow chord around a tree as a truck hovers agonisingly over the side of a cliff – all this whilst hostile variants of the dinosaurs located therein loom in the area. Where it wants to go broader and better, it just comes off as slack and goofy; a film lacking the rawness and wonder of the first and just ending up confused and sporadic in ways that are, frankly, quite dull.",5,4,8,12 September 2011
Cars," Much closer to the fast-lane than it is the hard shoulder, Cars is a neat and pleasurable animated excursion with an ability to sneak up on us.
","Cars is a 2006 animated feature from that of the Pixar stable, they of that wondrous ability to seemingly breath life, indeed fresh air, into worlds given radically creative overhauls; in doing so, providing specific dynamics to a functioning and working universe featuring oft-inanimate objects now come alive and living with their own patriarchies and politics. When the process works, it can be enchanting; when it doesn't, the films can often grind one down – Cars is an instance in which the proverbial rabbit is pulled from the hat, and whilst not on a level with their best work, is easily one of the better films the studio has produced. Owen Wilson, lending his 'talents' behind a microphone but instead off screen, voices Lightning McQueen; a sports car in an eye-catching shade of red operating within a world devoid of humans in which cars may speak; act and, excusing the pun, drive proceedings. McQueen is young and cocksure, a rookie within the career field of motor racing somewhat closely resembling that of NASCAR; plugging away at race after race in the long season and coming to find himself on the brink of winning the elusive Piston Cup, the prize for heading these standings at the end of the year. When we join him, he is at the venue for the final race – the points level between he, the serial champion of the sport and a competitor often stuck with the runner's up spot on account of him. At the track, the stands are beset by an audience solely made up of cars and other vehicles; heaven only knows what might constitute as a Diamond League meeting in this universe. Whilst there, numerous company brands and labels are slapped all over cars; barriers and buildings, but they are fictional and what might have been easy product placement is pleasantly avoided. McQueen races and races well, but rejects the idea of teamwork and guns for all the glory all by himself when turning down a pit-in chance and the allowing of his crew to get involved: it's all about him and his glory.The race ends in a remarkable three way tie between the front runners and a one-off playoff is announced between the three. We build an image of McQueen being somewhat of a vain, limelight loving showoff - a celebrity figure very much enjoying the verbal jousting with rivals and the gluts of attention which fly his way as the new hotshot following this remarkable first season. There is a quieter moment reflecting how far he's come when a certain sponsorship company is revealed to have once helped get McQueen off the ground; his moving onto larger plains and bigger companies whilst leaving the old one somewhat in the dark reiterating this inability to be anything other than self-centred and malevolent. Enter one or two good gags about cars operating within this world both falling asleep at the wheel and attempting to jump a level crossing, at which the trains are as anthropomorphistic as the cars are, and a road trip to the playoff race which goes horribly wrong when McQueen tumbles out of his pit team's truck and is left stranded in the wilds of America.Where he ends up is a small town sweetly named Radiator Springs; his chaotic arrival born out of panic near-enough destroying it. Bossed by that of Paul Newman, lending his voice to a 1950's gag-guzzler, Doc Hudson, and populated by a mixture of stereotypical Italians, Mexicans, louder than life African American women and VW van's whom are hippies, McQueen is caught and kept to fit the bill of the damage. We spot what might happen whilst he's there, although crucially, enjoy those eventual places it takes us. Life away from the glitz; glamour and gaudiness of the track-side, track-set existence sees McQueen come to recognise the simpler, more down to Earth ways of certain others. He comes to make friends with a tow truck named Mater, whose friendship is one of an honest and grounded nature away from the strictly businified racing world ties. Through an equally young-as-McQueen-is Porsche named Sally (Hunt), we observe a strong and empowered female presence in the town whom achieved a fair amount in a specific career field herself; McQueen's interaction with her is a joyous observing of him manoeuvring away from fatuous pit-lane girls and Hollywood socialites and towards more grounded people.Where one might say the Tom Tom navigation device is set firmly to where it's going to head from an early stage, we are surprised by the effect Cars comes to have on us. We foresee specific frameworks, anticipate character shifts and yet it comes to engage us to the level it does, often even coming across as quite moving. One could criticise the narrative frameworks for these things all day long – it is a churlish, fruitless exercise. Is 2009's 'Up' much more than a film about a man coming into contact with the young boy he never had in life running in parallel with a father-figure that aforementioned boy struggles to find? Likewise, narratively speaking, is Toy Story much more than two binary oppositional components in character form thrust together and forced into recognising both one other as well as their own natures? Is Finding Nemo much more than a buddy-pic road movie that happened to be set underwater? In their barest forms, most of what overlies these films are sound and routine – when unfolded around great adventure and exuberance, they exude degree of charm difficult not to get caught up in. It happens again here.",7,0,0,19 September 2011
JFK," Powerful, political, engaging and important; there isn't much JFK does wrong.
","I think JFK as a film succeeds on multiple levels. It manages to inform and educate without ever feeling like a lecture; it manages to entertain and engross without ever feeling like it's trying too hard to either offend you or maintain your interest with cheap gimmicks; it manages to create enough doubt and give you enough material to make up your own mind without ever feeling like it's insulting or patronising you. I very recently saw the recent acclaimed film The Queen which revolved around the death of a global icon, Lady Diana, but where that one was more about reaction, JFK is more about action.The reason I found JFK to be better than The Queen is because it tells you of the assassination and then jumps forward three years, showing you how one man came to work out a possible conspiracy theory. Likewise with any subject; create a theory, a hypothesis and research your area of study. It can be science (Newton  Gravity), mathematics (John Nash); hell even film/cinema (Mulvey  The Gaze) but Jim Garrison (Costner) comes up with and works out a theory that Kennedy was perhaps killed in ways different to what we would all believe and that Oswald (Oldman) is not as guilty as you would think. This is the basis for the film and it works an absolute delight. Yes, the film's narrative is a little confusing and difficult to follow but keep reminding yourself that this is a theory one man is trying to crack; a sort of 'who dun it' in the vast world of 1960's America but the detective is one mere man with some researchers to back him up.Comparing the film to another 21st Century detective tale is perhaps a little silly to do if I was comparing them in terms of quality but JFK very much reminded me of recent effort Zodiac; one man tries to find the truth behind a major event that remains unexplained but whilst Robert Graysmith was a comic book artist, Garrison is a man of the law anyway and we accept that he is up to the challenge. But JFK is arguably better because there is no definitive point of view. Witnesses and people who might know something give their own accounts through their own flashbacks; this is JFK acknowledging that its hero cannot know of other peoples flashbacks if he was not present at the time and thus; gives us impressive and dramatic black and white scenes revolving around either the death or events taking place somewhere else with someone else. Some examples here include Jack's (Lemmon) memory of being pistol whipped; Willie's (Bacon) memory of the gang talking about how great it would be if Kennedy died and Clay's (Lee Jones) memories of a homosexual romp at his house  the genius here is that each flashback may be the truth, it may be a lie or it may be mere memory catching up with its harbinger.Make no mistake that the film is political. This is a brave film from Oliver Stone and one that I'm sure opened the eyes of the people watching it; not just at what it was saying but perhaps made them question the assassination altogether. Getting back to The Queen; when Diana did die, the country was in morning and I can imagine a similar reaction to Kennedy in 60s America but how stupid, perhaps embarrassed, would those people have felt if they'd realised it was all a lie and that the government had her killed due to insider reasons? After the reaction and the funeral (which is in the top 5 most watched televised items in Britain's history) and everything else; how perhaps anticlimactic would it be if we all learnt she was deliberately murdered; indeed an inquest happening round about now might just un-turn some facts no one wants to know. But this is the film JFK at its core; one man who wants everyone to build up the courage to perhaps realise the inevitable: their country's government has been lying and what was once an event that brought the nation together; now motivates the people to turn away from the state.JFK would have us believe a group of homosexuals set up a complex idea that killed Kennedy, for the first half. But the checkpoint arrives in the form of 'X' (Sutherland) who gives Garrison clues and information just when everything seems lost. After the press publicise Garrison's attempts, Jim is embarrassed and lost but it works FOR him as the papers are how 'X' discovers Jim to be so close. His monologue, maybe one of the longest if not memorable from 1990s cinema; sways not only Jim's view but ours: maybe this group are not so guilty and the government are up to no good. The fact 'X' thinks that the government thought that he was so good at cracking these things, he was shipped to the middle of snowy nowhere, could be an ego trip on X's behalf but it could be the disturbing truth; we might never know. JFK basically tells us one thing for the first half, telling us the argument's one side before flipping the proverbial pancake and letting the other half simmer whilst the one in focus now has its very own moment. JFK is almost a guerrilla film: its use of politics, its fast edits of real footage; perhaps subliminally blinding us with placards of 'Hooray for JFK' and its strong feeling of realism as it dawns on you that you are not watching fiction is eerie as it is brilliant. Apart from the genius of the depth; the film is still well acted with a sprinkling of stars, great dialogue and impressive cinematography. The argument Garrison delivers in the courtroom is fascinating as it is brilliantly executed, twinned with Oswald's 'real' actions  a film that will captivate and spellbound, at least until 2039.",8,3,15,25 January 2008
Drive," Gritty character drama that is unfolded with grace and nuance.
","'Drive' reminded me in many ways of another excellent mobster film entitled 'Eastern Promises' - both are made with a noticeable level of maturity, in that neither are afraid of moving at their own pace, and both tell a very intriguing character driven narrative which, by chance, happen to revolve around drivers. Events unfold, not slowly, but methodically; there are bursts of violence which disturb us, but it isn't played for entertainment; characters interact with one another realistically, and they get to know one another in ways which we find plausible and inherently satisfying.'Drive' tells the story of a youngish man, played by Ryan Gosling, living in Los Angeles who works as a stunt man in the local film industry and moonlights as a getaway driver for the common crook. When driving for some petty criminals who need someone to get them out of dodge fast in the dead of night following a warehouse robbery, he is in his element avoiding accidents and dodging the police - as a stuntman, his job under the bright Californian sunshine consists of getting involved in ORGANISED accidents. Perhaps symbolically, he must don masks in order to look like the character which ought to be doing the driving. The opening warehouse heist itself is a piece of work - untypically for the genre, the film decides to teasingly hang back in the quiet confines of the car as the actual theft happens - it cleverly utilises a two minute shot-clock countdown radiating from the car stereo blaring out a basketball game to crank up the suspense. We have already had it confirmed to us in the opening scene that a smart looking sports car in a sea of old 1950's relics is 'very' our lead, inferring an air of modernity in a man otherwise operating in a world of older models.These particular 'models' consist of borderline acting heavyweights Bryan Cranston; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman, who are dead-on the right choices for their respective roles when it may have been tempting to merely cast the likes of James Woods; Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Each of these particular characters come to occupy important, yet dangerous, places in our lead's world: Shannon, played by Cranston, is a film director who employs Gosling's character to do all the stunt work - his limp and twitchy mannerisms, in what is a wonderful performance, exudes a kind of nervousness where there doesn't seem to be the need for any. Bernie (Brooks), meanwhile, looks to employ Gosling as a stock-car racer - director Nicolas Winding Refn places him above Gosling when they first meet, and lingers on Brooks' outstretched hand as they go to shake for a little too long for it not to mean something. Nino, played by Perlman, runs a local restaurant - he clashes with Bernie, but they are evidently equal in general stature. At home, more importantly still, is Irene (Carey Mulligan), who lives down the hall in the apartment block with a young son and a husband in prison. It is through his interactions with her that Winding Refn tells the story of his lead becoming somebody else, juxtaposing her softly spoken demeanour with the other character who will play the biggest role in this chapter of his life in the form of Bernie, a tough-talking tough guy. One particularly impressive stroke from the film lies in how Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), behaves upon being released from prison. We sensed the film may have gone down a route of depicting a budding relationship between the lead and Irene, only for the husband to re-arrive on the scene and have something to say about it, but it doesn't unfold like that. Moreover, Standard is not merely some psychopath - he appears weak, and is even mired in some money trouble. It is then though these debts that the final act of the film is propelled wherein Gosling's character become more heavily involved than he'd like. 'Drive' is full of various feats of film-making which, for me, places it above most films of its genre. Certainly, the manner about which everybody seems to get along with one another during the opening act is incredibly deceptive in one sense, and I think if the film appears overly-violent; shocking or even completely unpredictable, then it is for the reason that Winding Refn does not unfold the second half of his film with characters behaving symptomatically of how they interacted in the first half. Additionally, and without giving anything away, what occurs during the raid on the pawn shop catches us totally off-guard because Gosling's character had already been established to be the ultimate professional in getting away from robberies. The opening heist was more complicated; unfolded in a larger building and was at night in the dark, so we expect the pawn shop robbery to run smoothly. The film then goes on to subvert heist genre norms by revolving the last scenes around a character wanting to RETURN the spoils of a theft to its rightful owner as they hunt him down anyway.Chiefly, 'Drive' is a character study with Gosling's nameless driver at the heart of it - he is transitioned from being robotic and somewhat faceless to being someone who cares about somebody else and their predicament. When he agrees to be involved in the pawn shop robbery, he is doing so out of compassion for Irene and the family rather than strictly for the cheque - the traffic rushing by in opposite directions in the background, as he sits in a diner realising this, seems to signify the scrambling his core outlook has just begun to undertake. With its performances; direction and story-telling on top of this, 'Drive' is very easy to recommend.",8,2,3,21 August 2018
Frozen," Disjointed but mostly enjoyable animation which is undeserved of its praise.
","At the core of 'Frozen' are lessons on responsibility and how power requires both a calm head and tremendous care. It is also the perfect film for two young sisters to sit down and absorb together, and not just because kids will like the bouncy songs and the funny snowman, but because its central relationship is between two sisters. This is, as far as I'm aware, quite rare - lots of Disney films have of course depicted the tales of princesses, but central to this particular effort is the friendship between two children (eventually young women) who share a blood kinship. The film is designed, it would therefore seem, to impart the message that things do not always go according to plan in families (nor in love), but that they are ultimately worth sticking at.'Frozen' begins in the setting of Arendelle, a fictitious and seemingly Scandinavian kingdom set what appears to be many centuries ago - it depicts Elsa (Kristen Bell) and Anna (Idina Menzel), who are daughters to a royal family and they live in a palace. For reasons unexplained, young Elsa possesses the very X-Men-like magical ability to turn anything into a wintry, snowy object. This leads to the rendering of playtime with her younger sister Anna a little more exciting than it might ordinarily be, with snowball fights and large slippery ice flumes around the huge interior rooms they occupy being the order of the day. Elsa is heir to the crown, but is considered too dangerous to be around her sister for fate of nearly killing her with her abilities. As a consequence, the girls are segregated against their will until both are old enough to identify with a degree of maturity. By the time this arrives, their parents are dead and Elsa is due to inherit the throne. The years spent apart have forged the girls into two binaries where previously they were one-and-alike, foreshadowing the divide in the family which initiates the film's main body. Anna can barely contain her excitement, for the reason that she is on the cusp of being able to interact with other people at the ceremony and potentially even find a spouse. Elsa, on the other hand, is terrified of being let loose on the world - she isn't fully in control of her emotions. She came close to killing somebody once, and she may accidentally do it again...Something resembling this isn't too far from what unfolds, forcing a berserk Elsa off and away into the wilderness and Arendelle to resemble Narnia. The bulk of the film then comes to form Anna's trek to find rediscover her sibling and try to put things right, while a plot back home is hatched by an unscrupulous Duke who sees his chance to come into possession of the kingdom amidst what I can only describe as a constitutional crisis. En route, she meets an ice-trader named Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), who possesses the wisdom to see that Anna's falling in love with someone at first sight back at the coronation is silly, yet entrusts that reindeers make for better accomplices than people...The film is by no means a failure, but has a hard time balancing the two sisters as duel-protagonists and suffers as a consequence - there is a healthy degree of ambition in what directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck attempt, but it all too often feels like a bit of a weekend cartoon in need of some reigning in. To whom 'Frozen' belongs remains a constant source of ambiguity - it is at once Anna's love story and yet it is Elsa's journey of self-discovery; both characters learn to control their emotions, but are not the primary focus for long enough for most of us to really ease ourselves into their respective stories, all of which leads me to the conclusion that the film is best viewed by young siblings (preferably sisters) who will be able to take something from either strand based on who is the eldest in that family.Certainly, the film looks good - the wintry setting has been brought to life wonderfully well and is certainly able to take its place alongside the likes of 'Wreck-It Ralph' and 'Finding Nemo' as an accomplishment of special effects whereby you are plunged into a world entirely different to our own. If I were to accuse the film of needing the character of Olaf (Josh Gad) to provide it with a bit of energy - even to keep it amusing - I imagine few would argue. If lacking in this magical, wise-cracking snowman, whom Anna meets along her way to confront Elsa, the film is not even necessarily funny, and takes on an entirely different complexion. Its songs, whilst on the receiving end of much praise, struck me as somewhat ordinary and too recurrent. Perhaps it is because I am not the target audience for the film that I could not take to it to any tremendous degree, but I do not consider myself shut off from animated films nor Disney's output generally - I left 'Frozen' a little cold, and far from feeling the enthusiasm I have done for their past projects.",6,2,2,2 October 2018
The Lives of Others," Taut and rather powerful German thriller focusing on the power struggle between a handful of people towards the end of a controlling era.
","The world in which The Lives of Others is set is a grey and frightening one; one that evokes fear, suspicion and tension. It takes place in a world and at a time that really existed; and amongst the vast, vast annuals of history - the period, or 'era', of mid 1980s East Germany is a fairly recent time and place as to which dramatic events should be observed as they play out. We may not be looking at a period in history that shaped how the world would turn out; nor indeed are we focusing on individual events or wars that formed new nations and beliefs - rather, the focus is on a handful of people and how their own lives are shaped by the state. The Lives of Others is more of a minute piece, it has that cold and intimate feel to it; that precise sensation of something being studied and etched out playing out amidst the Soviet controlled nation that was East Germany in the not so long ago late 20th Century.The film is ten times the piece the recent Bourne sequels are. As a film exploring the practise of eavesdropping, spying and espionage; director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck opts for the polar opposite approach by painting a very grim and ominous backdrop of the time and setting via the cinematography, and constructs his film in a slow and very precise manner. Perhaps slow is the wrong word, I'm thinking more along the lines of 'calm' and 'patient', evoking a very visceral sensation for a lot of the time that reflects the action of spying and eavesdropping: a calm and patient approach to a task that takes time.The film is the second of recent times from German film-makers exploring Germany's past and identifying past ideologies and beliefs. The other is Die Welle (The Wave), a film that explored the fanaticism and national interest behind politics and how seemingly easy it was to install a charismatic leader, garner attention and form minority factions amongst everyone else. The Lives of Others is a piece exploring Germany's past Communist driven areas, almost the whole of the East in particular, and how power; paranoia; gradual obsession and seemingly absurd political demands can lead to fear plus the actual eventual demise of people's lives.The film is a series of exchanges between three primary individuals; a game of power play if you will. Sebastian Koch plays Georg Dreyman, a playwright living with a certain Christa-Maria Sieland (Gedeck) in East Germany, circa 1984. After attending one of his plays and observing the goings-on, Gerd Wiesler (Mühe) is adamant the above writer is suspicious enough to warrant a number of bugs be fitted to his apartment so that spying can be carried out, and observations made. When we are first introduced to Mühe's Wiesler, a lecture he is giving to budding students of the secret police are studying the arts of interrogation; an interrogation which is being revealed in tandem with the speech as the young learners watch on. The following scene sees Wiesler himself as an audience member, watching on from the confines of a balcony as a play gets underway. The notion of watching-on is made aware early on to us, that parallel between students observing a lecture and picking up on things followed by the teacher himself observing a performance and having his suspicions is apparent.Mühe plays Wiesler to an absolute tee. His performance feels detached from the rest of the film, but in the nicest possible way - the manner in which he plays the character gives off an uncanny sense about him, as if he has stumbled in off another production. As everyone else around him performs to whatever degree they see fit, Mühe elevates his character onto another realm; echoing what other actors such as Hopkins and Bardem did in The Silence of the Lambs and No Country for Old Men, respectively. He comes across as colder than everyone else, as if he's been beamed in from another far off place. Wiesler is extremely robotic in his actions and movement, constantly clad in grey and neutral colours and nary giving much away by way of facial expressions. The man is creepy and mechanical in movement and professionalism; he speaks in short and to-the-point sentences and phrases. There's an odd scene in which he is caught asleep during a late eavesdropping session on Dreyman and his partner by the guy on the next shift; after which he gets up, thoroughly embarrassed and somewhat ashamed that he's been caught looking like a human being.The film will branch out into all sorts of bother for the leads, in the sense illegal publications of articles on suicides and unregistered typewriters will be the order of the day. The film touches on themes of honour and guilt as Maria gets involved a little too deeply, and certain revelations cause Wiesler himself to question where his loyalties lie. Drenched in a metallic, stone-cold look and with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar under its belt, The Lives of Others is an interesting and brooding period piece that shines thanks to its impeccable directing, individual acting performances and menacing narrative complimenting its menacing aura.",7,0,1,20 November 2009
Hellboy," Watching this is like a cross between an X-Men film and watching a true expert play a 'beat 'em up' computer game against a feeble, first timer opponent.
","At a time when the majority of films are comic book, action adventure adaptation films; I doubt we needed another CGI laden superhero film that had villains after world domination and a seemingly indestructible protagonist who is clearly the only match for whatever villainy the film can cook up. Hellboy is a nice to look at action film that never takes itself too seriously yet embodies several tired and familiar routines to keep it running. These include the old anti-hero persona that Hellboy (Perlman) carries with him throughout, the way the characters in the film are practically non-existent except for Hellboy and the main enemy and the fact the film sometimes contradicts itself regarding its ideas.In essence; Hellboy feels like a poor man's 'Men in Black'. It carries all the action and humour of the first Men in Black film, it copies Men in Black's use of a 'fish out of water' technique but the character of John Myers (Evans) is the character here and he's partnered up with Hellboy just like Agent Jay was with Agent Kay. The difference here is that Myers is sort of assigned to 'baby-sit' Hellboy because Hellboy needs his meals and needs to be kept out of public view but by half way through the film, Hellboy has had so much public exposure that his secret is out and nobody seems to care; rendering Myers useless after about forty minutes of the film whereas Agent Jay was Kay's partner throughout and was dealing with aliens and clearing up the mess wherever needed. I thought that Hellboy should've taken the approach Men in Black did and have these two people get into their own adventures but Myers is built up at the beginning as someone important and as someone who will have an impact on the film and Hellboy's adventures  in the end, he was just unnecessary.I was not moved by Hellboy and was not impressed with any deeper, more technical things. The film is shallow and rather poorly structured with the supporting characters consisting of human beings wielding machine guns and wearing suits (another 'should-be' Men in Black reference?). They are supposed to defeat the other type of character: CGI created fish-like monsters who are clearly no match for the human beings yet it is decided they do battle anyway. Other than this, there is just no conflict in the film. Everyone is weak except for Hellboy and a Nazi demon-like character who for some reason knows a mixture of kung-fu and how to use knifes and daggers like a Samurai  not particularly accurate. The reason there's no conflict is because whenever an enemy goes up against a human being, we know who will win; like-wise whenever Hellboy goes up against anything, we know who will win. There are also too many one-on-one fights that are too one-sided - meaning they play out like a fox battling an injured chicken.I'd say that Hellboy is perhaps a 'fun' film but maybe I watched it with my brain turned on a little too much. There is enough material to structure something clever: A Nazi experiment goes wrong, a demon enters our world and there are numerous other monsters it can do battle with. I felt that if Hellboy and the allies had another character who was equally as strong as Hellboy was, it might have been interesting. The character of Liz Sherman (Blair) is introduced and fits this character but she comes in far too late. The fish-like character of Abe Sapien (Jones) was there from the beginning but he was perceived as quite weak. Also, there are too many one sided duels throughout the film that just make it another CGI, comic book film that goes through the motions, has the showdown at the temple/castle or whatever and then kills itself off with a twist of fate or an individual act of genius from the hero. Hellboy is not a particularly good film but will entertain on a basic level although there are better films that do this; namely Men in Black.",6,1,3,28 September 2007
Hellboy," Fairly generic sci-fi adventure tale, but with some fantastic art-design and a really likable lead at the core of it
","Hellboy seems like a cool hero, and he deserves a better film than the one he gets here, which is too full of leaps in logic and extraordinarily inconsistent in tone. Like Superman, he seems to care enough for our world in order to save it from some pretty nefarious people when the time comes - perhaps chiefly because, like Superman, he doesn't actually have a home world of his own to go back to. He's cocky; confident and a little rebellious, although remains faithful to those who have taken care of him up to this point in his life. The film's beginning sets an odd, fantastical tone which does not really dissipate for the rest of its runtime. It's 1944, and despite the fact the Channel Islands were the only part of the British Isles the Germans ever conquered during The Second World War, the Nazis are in Scotland. There, they are looking to end the war quickly; sensing, I suppose, defeat, what with their failing campaigns in North Africa and on the Eastern Front, and so turn to opening up portals to dimensions beyond our observable world in order to call upon higher powers to help them. But, how do they know if this unknown entity will be sympathetic to their aims? The imagery of the opening is also too reminiscent of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', which culminated in such a show - we are at a stage now in blockbuster cinema whereby a film like 'Hellboy' decides to BEGIN with it.Alas, for the Nazis, something goes wrong in their experiment when the American (not British) soldiers, who have been tracking them all this way, launch an ambush to quash the mission. With them is a young professor named Trevor Bruttenholm, who is eventually played in his old age by John Hurt. In the ensuing chaos, something does indeed pop out of what was a gateway to Hell - the aforementioned and eponymous Hellboy: a small, red demon who is eventually played in his 'old' age by Ron Perlman, by which point he is a conspiracy theory amongst modern New Yorkers despite there being photographic evidence of him posing in a picture with the soldiers. Guillermo del Toro uses this set up to tell a tale which is mostly interested in set direction and costume, which makes a change to having to sit through a film of this stock which is mostly interested in action, although there is quite a bit of action... In the twenty-first century, Hellboy is kept in an FBI lockup with a variety of other quirky occultist stuff from non-history - he's at an age in his life now whereby he is bored, and craves action and adventure and quite likes the idea of having a girlfriend. Whatever it is they groom young demons to do in Hell, Hellboy isn't getting it here.Away from this, something is brewing - the Nazis who failed to win The War the first time around are gunning for another shot. In true 'The Mummy' style, two of these Nazis, played by Karel Roden and Bridget Hodson, are able to live forever in a cursed state and set out with the intent to bring about the apocalypse anyway. On their side is an odd, machine-like tin-made ninja decked out in Nazi garb and a bizarre fish-like creature whose raw brawn they use to buttress their offensive.The thinking and the energy behind 'Hellboy' is a lot more interesting than the finished product itself, which finds comfort in telling a tale of heroes fighting villains with the world at stake. More interesting are the characters, particularly the supporting ones who are all at once beautiful; terrifying; fascinating and ugly to look at - we sense they each have their own worlds, complete with complicated biological ecosystem to slot into, somewhere in the universe, just nowhere that we can imagine. The film seems to lose its focus too often, coming off as very wayward in tone as scenes of brutal violence involving villainous sword-play are intercut with sardonic putdowns from the protagonist. It also seemed as if there was a love story in an earlier draft, or cut altogether, involving a character who could not control the fire she could produce from the palms of her hands. The film ends up in deepest of snowy Russia and Hellboy being carted around in a box, but why bother hiding him if his identity is out by this point? And what do the Russian authorities think of an FBI entourage in their country anyway? Irrespective, 'Hellboy' is a lot of good, harmless fun which fans of the genres of action, horror and science fiction should devour.",6,0,1,4 August 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The film has its problems and its issues that need straightening out but when it's not trying to offend, it is definitely entertaining.
","I think the second Lord of the Rings film is more manipulating than it is entertaining or epic. It's true to say that I had only seen this for the first time very recently and did not have the previous viewing that I had going into the first Lord of the Rings film, (which I liked then and liked now) so to say I enjoyed this to a lesser extent may be down to those reasons; maybe it's a film that grows on you with repeated viewings.But The Two Towers is a somewhat bloated and manipulating film that has its moments of greatness and sheer adventure packed in amongst some shocking issues of representation and general repetition, but the film is an all round success overall. Harking back to the Classical Hollywood days in which if someone was shot or killed, a sudden, stirring and jarring piece of music may start up to officially 'announce' the kill since you could not show the murder itself because of censorship. Here, the music is playing that sort of role again but it is to the opposite sort of effect; every long shot we cut to, every establishing shot of vast mountains and hills (some of which are in CGI format) we see are accompanied by over the top, melodramatic music that brings an odd smile to my face while watching. It's the sort of cue for all of us to hold our hands to our cheeks and gasp in amazement. The film tells us when to be scared, happy, wary, who to like and dislike and when to laugh; which is a shame.Sticking with the melodramatic theme, some of the situations the characters find themselves in are made all the more so when they need not be. There are numerous insert shots and several lines of dialogue surrounding Aragorn (Mortensen) and another female whose name escapes me as they exchange glances and lines. 'I see you're good with the sword' he says after she gives a little teaser as to her skills before the impending doom. Then there are the exchanged looks as he lies down, injured, much later on. But it is to no avail as Aragorn has an off-screen love, but don't worry; she pops up to remind us (and Elrond (Weaving)) of the situation. But the representation and underwhelming attention to detail are the two most frustrating things of this film. I do not know how faithful to Tolkien's book the film is, but from the film I can only gather that either Jackson or Tolkien had a massive problem with short, elderly men who have beards. I'm talking about the dwarfs here and how they are consistently the butt of every joke.The peak of this embarrassing representation occurs during the castle siege scene. Rows of allies are on the upper levels, looking out at the enemy. Gimli (Rhys-Davies) cannot see but everyone else can. 'Would you like me to find you a tool?' asks Legolas (Bloom). Gimli's height is mocked here but it goes deeper than that. All the humour in the film is directly a result of Gimli's antics, thus relegating him to the comic relief character. Aragorn and Legolas are in serious conversation with the king but as these two normal sized, athletic and handsome men talk; Gimli is sitting at a table tucking into a drumstick, alienated from the conversation with the camera cutting to him just once; so he can belch and maybe cue some laughs. After this belch, the camera cuts back to the conversation and everything continues after the 'funny' pitstop.But it's not the weight, looks and height that is merely targeted; the pratfalls continue when Gimli embarrasses himself after not correctly fixing his armour  it slips off him and he is left to rue an awkward moment when Aragorn and Legolas stare and smirk below Gimli's waist. Furthermore, Gimli is describing what female dwarfs look like (which is a lot like male ones) before his horse bucks and charges off; Gimli is inferior enough not to be able to control the horse and he falls, while everyone laughs at him. Half way through the film, there is a fight on a plain in which Legolas kills many enemies and Aragorn actually comes close to death to defeat the odds but Gimli is relegated, once again, to the butt of the jokes. He has numerous enemies fall on top of him, rendering him incapacitated as he groans and hopes the others do the work for him.Of course the film is not one long exposure; but an interesting and well un-folded tail about the tiniest of things that can do the largest of damage. The manipulation of time early on is impressive as we discover what happens after other timelines catch up and leave off. Whereas I noted a whole load of bad things about the film, that does not mean I didn't like it. Legolas and Gimli's colloquial approach to the final siege as chaos and murder occurs around them to those of an inferior skill is in bad taste, as is making the enemy men whom ride large elephant creatures look like Arabs; with their clothing and veils. Gollum's schizophrenia and delusion seems a little unnecessary and do drag on but they will suffice, that is all. I do not buy into the mountains of praise the film gets; pretty to look at and reasonably fun to watch, yes, but will it hold up over time? Probably not.",6,0,1,6 April 2008
Schindler's List," Fascinating tale about the hope of life and the promise of safety linked to one man and several thousand others, unfolding amongst an ocean of carnage.
","Schindler's List begins with the striking of a match and the consequent lighting of a candle in a small room; an action which illuminates the rest of the locale and sheds light on those in the form of people and items around it. Steven Spielberg's film is a piece which goes on to shed degrees of light on a man, whose titular list and what it incurs, is the harrowing but brutally honest subject for this three hour true-to-life experience. Shot in black and white amongst deathly downcast greys which combine brilliantly with chillingly cold white in the form of snow and general skyline, Schindler's List unfolds amidst a bleak time of murder and pillage but will go on to focus on a ray of hope or salvation in the form of Nazi businessman Oskar Schindler; specifically, his work on the Eastern Front during World War 2 that saw him save and aid a vast number of Jewish people destined for slaughter.Liam Neeson plays the man, a factory owner of Czech origin living in the year 1939 about embark on a period of six or so years which will change his life and many of those he comes to interact with, forever. When we first encounter Oskar, he neatly lays his shirts out across a bed during preparation for an evening out; his room neat and very formal, large sums of spare money sitting idly in a nearby draw for whatever reason suggesting a rich or high lifestyle. The measure of the man in his charismatic abilities is are established when Schindler arrives at an function in the evening full of German Nazi officials; light entertainment in the form of cabaret as well as food and drink which is already flowing. When he first enters, very few people seem to know of him, but by the end of the evening he appears to have wedged himself in amongst everybody as the centre of attention and entertainment. At a function in which all of the other Nazi officials seem greyed out by the, Schindler comes to have a white ray of light fly over his face suggesting there's a little more to this man than just mere self-indulgence and death.Schindler's goals are entirely infused with tendencies that veer towards Capitalism, his dealing with the Nazi party officials see him enter a business proposition that'll have him enter with nothing but come away with a great deal of something. The situation as to whether we are on the side of Oskar in the initial stages is additionally challenged when it transpires if The War were to end, Schindler's enterprise might falter so the longer that most of the activity happening in and around everybody at this time continues, it's going to be pretty good for business. Inbetween all of this, The Second World War reaches somewhat of an infamous crescendo in and around the locality of Central Europe; The Holocaust causing widespread Jewish demotion into set Ghettos, later followed by evacuations leading onto murder for them but a severe clashing of morality for Schindler whom comes to realise employing these proverbial lambs to the slaughter would go a long way in saving them.The film is a high end piece of drama, balancing a character's gradual struggle with being able to offer salvation really well with its meshing of the war genre. Spielberg's gradual dragging of his lead away from a self-obsessed businessman always looking out for ways to make money out of the system into this mournful, regretful man makes for wonderful viewing. By the time he is weeping, towards the end, at what has happened or more importantly what hasn't happened in the saving of more Jewish people, we feel the need to weep with him - thus successfully aligning the audience with this figure whom was once how he was in his indulgent, Nazi function attending self. The comparison is somewhat bookended very simply in how it is both Schindler as a stand alone man and how the Nazis as a collective group go about the employment of the Jews and the manner in which they treat them in a physical sense. Where Schindler will come to offer hope and salvation in the shape of factory employment, regardless of ability or handicap, an early scene will see German soldiers ruthlessly eliminate an elderly man because of his inability to successfully carry out what it is they ask of him through their charging him with a task, namely, the shovelling away of snow so as to clear a public road.Schindler comes to stand in direct opposition to a fearsome Nazi Captain of the S.S. named Amon Göth (Fiennes), Göth additionally being based on a true to-life individual. Like Schindler, Göth is running a business or operation in which management and organisation are key; but while both members of the Nazi party and sharing similar basic ingredients as to their respective action plans, the men couldn't be any further apart in character. Göth arrives on the scene, a Kraków suburb called Płaszów, to help in the construction of a new concentration camp; the house on the hill he's charged with living in a dominant position in which he is able to overlook all of his work – construction orientated or otherwise. Just as Schindler goes out of his way to 'select' an aide or assistant in the form of Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern, Göth himself goes through a similar process of 'selecting' a assistant he renders a maid-come-slave in the form of a young Jewish woman. The measure of Fiennes' performance as Göth is highlighted in his ability to have the motivational 'tonight is history' monologue prior to a ghetto liquidation come across as just as chilling as the act of liquidation itself. The film is an exhausting watch; an enthralling character study set amidst dark and desperate times as a man's shifting viewpoints play out.",7,9,14,25 October 2010
The Incredibles," Bird veers more towards an audience of infants as pained formula and the drawn out unravelling of messages are the order of the day.
","The title of the 2004 animated, American, child orientated film The Incredibles is wholly ironic. Lauded by critics and audiences on release, presumably for being yet another feature animated film to have come out of the American stable of CGI infused pieces, the likes of which for some reason everyone feels the need to jump to both the defence and lauding of as quickly as possible, The Incredibles leaves a lot to be desired as it weaves its way down a plodding road to an uninspired finale of crashing; hitting and farce. Where Brad Bird's previous film, 1999's The Iron Giant was sombre; sweet and mature in its observing of a friendship between boy and machine, The Incredibles is loud; in-your-face; obnoxious and a gross muddle of cross-contaminated child and adult orientated material which does not work. The film is dull; plodding; limp; lacking in imagination despite the sorts of ideas it takes on; predictable and without a mite of peril nor interest.Bird plays too many cards at once, he ruins the omelet with too many eggs; his film studying the progressive, domesticated lives of two superheroes of 15 years ago whom have gone into hiding despite still having wondrous superpowers before having them branch back out into a life-saving lifestyle once more. They are husband and wife Mr. Incredible aka Bob Parr (Nelson), an Hulk-like figure whom is incredibly strong and can withstand almost anything and Elastigirl aka Helen Parr (Hunter), a Stretch Armstrong-style character whom can extend her limbs to great length as well as bend and flex her way around mostly all obstacles. Incedible lives a mundane office life with an insurance company, longing for days of old but stuck with his wife and three kids Dash (Fox); Violet (Vowell) and baby Jack Jack in a detached suburban house with a car that conks out just as he's about to get home. The family is dysfunctional, but powerful; Incredible goes through an identity crisis in what he wants to be clashing with what his wife wants him to be and what the public want them all to be; they are the light of one another's respective lives just as they are one another's deathly foils.By way of a mysterious gadget, Mr. Incredible is lured back into the world of superhero-dom with the promise of a top secret mission; his home based office-come-hideaway shrine for the days of old shedding the dull grey shade it carries and lighting up with a brilliant shade of red in the process. His life is changed, and a bad montage robs the audience of his character's development as his attitude to life begins to alter in what is a cheap way of skipping forward towards the formula rather than focus on observed character change. Where The Iron Giant was all about these intricacies, The Incredibles isn't. The film has fun with the parents telling each other that days of old have gone, and that raising the kids is what ought to be occupying both their minds; something specific watching audience members will relate to more than I did as office politics and what's right for the people and the company clash at another time; the film even finding time to have Elastigirl suspect husband Mr. Incredible of having an affair in what is another suburban drama cliché included that only appears as a self-aware jab but is actually played for dramatic effect. The opening plods, it churns along at a rather excruciating pace; devoid of much interest and coming across as quite repetitive.Bird wants to play the revisionist card, beginning the film with a newsreel detailing interviews with Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl and a token African American character in Samuel L. Jackson's Frozone whom acts as the film's comic relief. Jackson has one good scene, the film's sole laugh, during which he sends up a subway sequence from the second Die Hard sequel here involving a water dispenser at a jewellers. The interviews see the characters plead to be considered as equal to human beings, each individual covered detailing everyday lives and activities. Later on, one or so characters make light of 'monologuing'; the act which sees the bad guy waffle on before having the hero get the jump on him. For all the self-aware, self-reflective material such as this; The Incredibles is deathly quick to conform, indeed descend into, rock 'em-sock 'em action as tales of good vs. evil and plots to take over the world with showdowns at baddie bases which come complete with greyed out uniform clad henchmen play out.As estimated, things don't go according to plan and the ill effects of idolising someone is promptly brought to the forefront in the form of Buddy Pine's alter-ego Syndrome, someone whom isn't actually a superhero but is just a kid with a qualification in design technology in that he's invented an array of gadgets to help form a superhero persona. The film descends into dull formula, Elastigirl and the kids having to come to eventually rescue their husband and father after visiting a Central European mentor whom provides ready made hero outfits and advice, people are quick to point out 'monologing', but nobody ever asks if eye-masks are really that good in terms of concealing identity. The film's painfully obvious message about responsibility on the kid's behalf is put across limply as the henchman of the villain begins to succumb to their own conscience and come around to aid the heroes in what is an arc that, if you cannot see coming, you just aren't at all trying. Its tone towards the end is grossly uneven, skipping from sentimental to action packed to comedic content in an uneven manner; the banter between mother and kids is annoying and whiny, when it ought to be bouncy in the vein of the two leads from Toy Story or Monsters Inc. The Incredibles was a turgid, predictable, messy farce that bores the senses.",4,1,6,31 July 2010
The Mist," Hazy, mysterious and with a distinct kick; The Mist holds up as a rather impressive 'last stand' film with a couple of things going for it.
","I wanted to love The Mist, I really did and that feeling dawns on you about half way through when you realise it isn't perfect and there are a few niggles but if you're in the right frame of mind and you're going with it, it offers an adrenaline fuelled ride of the horror and of the dramatic. As it turns out, I liked The Mist more than I did love it but it's still the sort of film you can engage with on certain dramatic levels that that hit particularly high notes of both terror, suspense as well as out and out horror. Take the incidence in which it has been established venturing outside is a death-wish and yet certain characters are forced into going out into the mist because of prior events. It's as basic, basic as routine as you like 'don't go there  but they have to' scenario that we've all seen many times before and yet you sit there, watching it and loving every tension filled second of it.Don't let me make The Mist come across as a guilty pleasure, because it's anything but. In Frank Darabont, the film has an extremely competent filmmaker and one who began his C.V. of most accessible Stephen King adaptations with a character filled drama set in a prison before branching out into another character based drama set in a prison of sorts but incorporating elements of the supernatural. Now he has this: a film that prods the needle a little further into the direction of the supernatural and away from the character study a tad although we don't really mind all that much once everything gets going. The Mist is probably Darabont's weakest King adaptation of the three discussed but again, do not allow it to sound like a criticism.The film is the sort that the trailers would have spoil for you, indeed I can remember one of those ridiculously fast TV spots popping up prior to its release not so long ago and revealing a little too much; I can only imagine how much a trailer might have given away and consequently spoilt at the time. That said, the intrigue of the mist and what it is and why it's there act as a wonderful back-boiling element to a film gradually establishing characters to whatever degree it sees fit and uneasy relationships others may have had in the past. One such individual in the film is David Drayton (Jane) whose house is partially destroyed by a falling tree that came as a result of a thunderstorm. He finds himself and his son holed up in a convenience store with a bunch of other innocents as odd mist descends, soon gobbling up the store's car park and general area.The unique selling point of the film is in its ambiguity revolving around the mist. The film is everything from Night of the Living Dead to Deep Rising all the way through to the relatively recent Dog Soldiers in which individuals are trapped within a 'base' and must submit to the film adopting a last stand arc. The difference with The Mist is that rather than zombies or werewolves, the film tears up the piece of paper detailing all known/necessary 'beasties' to lay siege to the setting and gives us a series of wonderful creatures fresh from the mind of Stephen King. To tell anyone what actually comes out of the mist would be both a cruel spoiler but also nigh on impossible to describe which is an achievement in itself.The Mist actually beds into a nice recent cannon of films detailing everyday people encountering fantastical monsters, following on from Korean film The Host and Cloverfield. I suppose the difference between these and previous films such as Eight Legged Freaks or From Dusk Till Dawn lie in their approach to the post 9/11 situation. Very early on in the shop, the camera flicks and switches and moves in that bizarre, hand held fashion you get when you watch amateur footage shown on news networks that was shot on location soon after a known attack. The feeling you get is distress and panic at the fact you don't know what's going on and neither do the characters. The added kick is as routine as you like: don't show the threat unless absolutely necessary.The film does not branch off into a realm of politics but that's not to say it doesn't include a fair amount of what it feels is necessary. Early on, an elderly school teacher blames the American government of concentrating too much on building weapons rather than using the money to improve the educational system and the characters connected to the military are presented in a mysterious, ominous and shadowy light. What's additionally eerie is the getting across of a religious individual as the primary source for antagonism within the group, something that starts off as a relative annoyance toward them but escalates to something much larger in an impressive manner. The Mist is, above most other things, just a cracking good ride. It carries that B-movie feel and that sense of overacting at times but it works for the film when things get rather frightening once encounters with the creatures crop up. Darabont recognises his inspirations early on with several paintings of films-past of this ilk and manages to steer clear of any blatant, unwanted product placement despite the fact the film takes place practically throughout in a convenience store full of goods. The Mist is a frightening at times and dramatic at other times production that keeps you gripped in that way a truly enjoyable horror films can; it isn't up there with the greats such as The Shining and Halloween but it isn't far off.",7,2,5,10 January 2009
Stardust," Inventive and oddly compelling adventure film about a character experiencing things outside of his comfort zone running on an engaging chase narrative and blunt hybridisation.
","For the most part, Stardust unfolds like some kind of concoction of Peckinpah's Ride the High Country with Midnight Run by way of the magic or ingenuity of a J.K. Rowling novel - and all of it filtered down and through a lens for people of about fifteen and upwards. Not that there's much wrong with any of that, Matthew Vaughn's 2007 follow up to his quite blistering 2004 debut Layer Cake coming to form that of a fair old frolic through some territory engulfing rather a lot of black comedy; some neat creativity born out of the film's alternate world setting full of ingenuity and its own infrastructure; affectionate characters undergoing somewhat moving arcs and a wonderfully clinical sense of progression as things are kept moving along without ever being allowed to slouch.The film begins with a voice over, a voice over read by that of Ian McKellen, whom just has the natural ability to make absolutely anything in the world sound as if it's the most important thing you've ever heard. Like a bedtime story, like someone that has read the same tale a thousand times and knows both the precise pitch as well as the tone which ought to accompany proceedings from the off, this fable-like telling of a fable-like tale begins warmly and enthusiastically, and is difficult not to become as involved in as the above suggests would like you to be. The opening tells the tale of how a certain Tristan came to be born, Charlie Cox's character coming about to exist when his father escaped from his sheltered existence in a remote English village named Wall and into the magical mythical world full of wonder; enchantment and young enslaved women named Stormhold – a place kept apart by a lone stone wall of a few feet in height one wonders why it is not harder to cross.Fast forward twenty or so years, and Tristan is a bit of a wimp whilst still living in the town of Wall; a place in which nothing has changed and everything has remained stilted. While allured by the portal into Stormhold, still guarded ably by an elderly man who's no slouch with a crook, his more immediate concerns lie with his love for Sienna Miller's Victoria, a girl already with a potential suitor whose request for marriage has already come through, but someone whom appears loose enough to break off such an engagement if it means Tristan is successful in a quest she playfully sets him. This item, the Macguffin, of which is later provided with its own personality, so not just a pretty face needing rescuing, is a fallen star named Yvaine (Danes); an item both the power mad brothers, sons of a dying king whose throne is up for grabs, predominantly focusing on Septimus (Strong) need in order to garner said rule but whose quest will not be any easier as they go up against three evil witches, whose fate of eternal youth and grossly enhanced magical powers is on the line should one of them, Lamia, fail in bringing it back. The three witches live life as old; bedraggled; wrinkled coots self-knowingly ugly as sin, Lamia's transformation from this into something a little more 'photogenic', so as to blend into Stormhold more easily, sees her morph not into some model-turned-singer-turned actress under thirty the film may have cast, but Michelle Pfeiffer - such is the manner in which Pfeiffer has aged so gracefully.Principally, the film is about this young man in Tristan desperately wanting to venture out beyond what he knows and entrusts to impress somebody he barely knows beyond that of looks from afar and bare bones reputation. His experiences in Stormhold, making up the crux of his circular journey, turn out to be rather frightening and somewhat dangerous and his coming into contact with this fallen star Yvaine sees him learn to both accept and respect what it is he has to begin with as well as to come to learn how to love a member of the opposite sex through ties and bonds which unfold naturally over a set period of time over lusting for the town's pretty-girl everybody wants a chance at. In depicting such notions, the film is quick to portray the predominant female characters as vampish or even evil; Yvaine representing the ultimate in purity or innocence whom, in the eyes of the film, are far more accessible and righteous and allow the protagonist to see sense.The film is a road movie of sorts, a touching enough romance contributing to a young man's exposure to the world and an at once brutal chase movie documenting some fairly desperate characters each chasing the same item for sake of respective goals leaning towards absolute power and/or pride. Its combinative aura of hybridisation and homage is encapsulated in both its dizzy supporting cast of screen legends and lower-key British talent whom, up until only a few years ago, were more inclined towards televisual work as well as its spasmodic leaping from content more inclined towards fantasy, fairytale and adventure clashing with some rather violent sequences egged on by the infrequent helping of animal cruelty. Regardless, Vaughn is a director that knows how to keep things moving along; he knows he's running off of a plot that might've been torn from a mid-50s, Classical era Hollywood B-movie Western feature of about 85 minutes and just runs with it – the results, of which, are more often than not really quite funny; somewhat practical and remarkably absorbing.",7,0,0,17 June 2011
I Am Legend," An interesting and well unravelled genre piece that revels in its scenes of sheer terror, pure heartache and what some might call dopey symbolism.
","I think 2007's I am Legend is a fitting enough adaptation of a popular book that I have read about in terms of it carrying so much weight in terms of ingenuity and inspiration for contemporary texts. Films like I am Legend come complete with threat of just collapsing under the sheer familiarity of both its set up and narrative, but this pulls through. In terms of its placement within the genre of survival horror, the film makes the grade rather easily, but it does so with its fair share of ideas; dramatic set pieces; genuinely heartbreaking moments and striking visuals of deserted contemporary Western pieces of iconography.I am Legend sees a solid, if familiar, set up involving what was first assumed to be a cure that helped humankind but actually carried a bit of a hitch. This is somewhere in late 2009. What was a cure for cancer progressed into a formula that mutates the individual it inhabits into something known as a Darkseeker which, rather obviously by name, demands they stay out of sunlight and in the nooks; crannies and rundown, abandoned buildings that make up the bulk of what is most probably all of the world's major towns and cities. So as to come across as contemporary, the film avoids the term 'vampire' in the same sense 28 Days Later avoided calling its antagonistic force zombies by manipulating into the text a plot point that demanded they be labelled 'infected'. Non-existent by day but screeching loudly and dominating the city by night, they act as a fairly interesting anti-human component to the text.During the opening, mankind as a species is relegated to that of resembling an ancient hunter; wondering, perhaps aimlessly if the daily goals are not achieved, through a once bustling arena of contemporary life represented by towering buildings; street lamps; cars and numerous vast, once electronic, billboards that used to display advertisements for the latest in 'must have' consumerist items. All of that has gone and, albeit aided with an automobile of his own, the individual shots of a wandering lead seeking out game for means of nourishment work well.The lead is Robert Neville (Smith), a once top U.S. Army virologist, now rendered the only known human left in New York City after having spent three years on his own. But he is accompanied by the film's non-human component, which comes in the form of his German Shepard dog named Samantha. For its very brief and relatively basic substance during this opening, I am Legend calls, albeit meekly, on inspiration from 2000's Cast Away as a man struggling with his loneliness in this dystopian setting. If Cast Away took place on a beautiful and somewhat exotic deserted island and turned it into a place of terror and no hope, then I am Legend's look at New York City as a place that retains its contemporary look and vast feel, only with undergrowth beginning to take over. The key difference is I am Legend's ingredient of an antagonistic force in the Darkseekers, something the lead must be weary of.But it is all very brief. Some key scenes to get across this factor of loneliness sees Neville interact with mannequins he has taken from other shops and actually placed in stores he visits to get across a sense that he is communicating with people. I am Legend's decision to break the film up into past and present tenses works surprisingly in its favour. The cut aways from the first instance we hear the Darkseekers howling in the night leave us on a knife edge of sorts as we go back into the past for some brief pre-apocalyptic story to do with Neville and his wife and young daughter. Addtionally, the flashbacks don't feel as intrusive as they might've done; we can take a break from Neville in his post-apocalyptic world and hark back to see the development of the outbreak without really feeling frustrated or torn away form something. The approach and this manipulation of time aids in distancing the film from things like 28 Days Later and the subsequent sequel released around the same time as I am Legend.If there is any substance in I am Legend, then it is rather unfortunately linked to the finale and the very end of the piece, which halts going into things too deeply. Other than this, the film is principally a nuts and bolts survival horror only with the lead being able to freely inhabit the space in which he is surviving in during the day. Items are removed from the text and the film dips slightly, whereas certain other elements are installed into the text, even if they carry a nagging, obligatory feel to them.It's thought that when the third element that does actually meet with Neville stumbles across him, it was God that brought them together. The introduction of God via the dialogue is a distinct shift towards what the film ultimately builds to: a scene of great sacrifice so that millions of others may live on, echoing the plight of Jesus Christ. It's the sort of symbolism that'll have some groaning in frustration, others crying gallons of tears, depending on which way the text sways you. But I bought it, and I enjoyed all the somewhat familiar point of attack; establishing of the situation; Neville's routine plus relationship with the new world in which he lived as well as the overall direction the film took me.",7,0,0,14 July 2009
Dog Day Afternoon," Confused and alienated youths going some way to produce a dog's dinner of a robbery, in what is a brilliantly executed drama piece.
","Dog Day Afternoon begins with a montage presented to us in a relatively upbeat fashion, a going over and presenting of tidbits of New York-set summer iconography as people enjoy tennis matches; time on a beach and young lovers' company with one another. The music is uplifting and upbeat, the weather warm and welcoming as various people of whom have dressed down to coincide with the climate totter about the streets and parks. The soundtrack is meaningfully toned down when we come to focus on the American flag, itself being lowered from a pole, before cutting to a car housing some shifty looking individuals outside a bank: the iconographic, or 'romantisised', view of the city comes to a bit of crashing halt as we zone in on a new band of youths of whom do not conform to the various groups of kids and youths most certainly on display in the 'outsider' montage. The flag's physical lowering is systematic with the film's own lowering into a part of New York the tourists don't see, and their clicking off of the radio thus killing the song we were actually hearing, is the ultimate act that confirms both their and this New York existence's presence.Dog Day Afternoon has this attitude towards New York and its inhabitants, keeping a distanced perspective of more typical New York City imagery and instead focusing on those inhabiting the undergrowth within; those with issues, problems, flaws and feelings as the actions and consequents of those that undertake the desperate deeds are observed. 'The robbery should have taken 10 minutes. 4 hours later, the bank was like a circus sideshow. 8 hours later, it was the hottest thing on live T.V. 12 hours later, it was all history. And it's all true' reads the film's tag-line; its 'hook', if you will. Not knowing a thing about the true-to-life events the 1975 released Best Picture nominee is based on may have added an extra layer of dramatic effect, but I've a feeling the film would work just as effectively with the knowledge of said events in mind.The film sees Al Pacino's Sonny Wortzik and John Cazale's Sal hole up in a bank much in the same way a certain John Wojtowicz did in reality with his accomplice Salvatore Naturile, on whose exploits the film is based. Of all the physical things wrong with what they do in conjunction with the robbery, the oral mentioning of their names out loud is probably the worst of the early stages; Sonny's general incompetence masked by Sal's real inability, we feel, to deal with what he's got himself involved in, and consequently coming across as more attributed to the scenario than he actually is. Sonny takes charge of the situation when the preplanned three of them is reduced to two after the bailing of an additional robber, Sonny does the talking and thinking as Sal inherits the characteristics of the sub-machine gun he wields: a short, small and sinister looking individual whom does very little and feels just as concealed from the action. You get the additional sense he could do some serious, rapid and biting damage if provoked. As one thing leads to another, a large crowd gathers outside and soon police negotiators representing their true-to-life incarnations, with altered names, are doing their utmost to defuse the situation.If Lumet is presenting the inhabitants of New York in his opening montage as the average, every-day New York City dwelling every-men as youngsters enjoys sports and one another's company; then the zoning in on the car of bank robbing youths might be seen as a marginalisation of said inhabitants as the disconnection they have from everyone else is made aware: their chosen activity is anything but of the populist or indeed legal variety. But rather than marginalise, or demonise, these people as nothing more than petty thieves or, as it transpires through one means or another, emotionally confused freaks involved in bizarre extramarital affairs; the film chooses to explore their plight and, crucially, if we are to compare them to the match-made youths in the opening montage, their straining relationships with wives and partners.While the true aims of why it is they are after such a large stash of money are more humbling than those of what most other thieves might have done it for, Lumet's film does not excuse the perpetrators of this crime, nor does it glamorise or idolise the characters. Instead broadening the study into a sort of collective struggle blended in with some other youngsters of the day: youths confused and alienated with both the system and authoritarian figures in general, in a nation whose government is supposedly corrupt-to-the-core given the shadow of Watergate still looming large, and whom were expected to go off and die in Vietnam on demand for phony ideologies of said government. The attention seeking, disillusioned youngsters that gather around the bank when the media circus kicks off sees many-a youngster heckle the police officers guarding the area and often crave meek fame for having seen around an event such as this, offering somewhat gleeful reactions to the result of being on display in front of a television camera and an (in)consequental few seconds of fame when they are not feeling as if they've achieved something by simply delivering a pizza to the crime scene. The film is rich in drama, the stand offs between Sonny and the police officers pushed right to the brink of which of the two sides might come out on top, and Lumet inches out as much heightened tension as possible in a film that is thoroughly worthwhile in its explorations and detailing.",8,0,0,17 July 2010
Kick-Ass," Never mind Kicking-Ass, Vaughn's latest is a kicking; screaming; thrashing assault on the senses which miraculously happens to be both pleasing and rather substantial.
","Matthew Vaughn's outlandish and somewhat squeamish 2010 film Kick-Ass makes the grade for sheer energy and unabashed outlandishness, a near-on two hour assault through all things in bad taste and devilishly daring content, delivered through this somewhat perverse filter of dark reds; purples; light greens accompanied by streaks of yellows as well as coldly metallic whites blended with grey. The film isn't so much about the things that it wants to say as much as it is the way in which it goes about saying them, something that dogs the film come the final act but until then remains an unabashed and full on blackly comedic onslaught of sadistic gangsters; disgruntled young men; elusive young women; sickly amusing juxtapositions and a whole lot of off-the-cusp content.Kick-Ass tells the tale of two males, one coming out of adolescence as his high-school days fritter away and his life situation appears to get worse by the day; the other a much older man, a discontent ex-cop whom was wrongfully imprisoned and is now seeking revenge in the harsh, unforgiving, intimidating basin that is modern day New York City. The adolescent is David Lizewski (Johnson), a boy living with his father following his mother's passing, not in control of his hormones and mostly living a self-identified pathetic existence consisting of being rolled over by bullies; rejected by girls, particularly young Katie (Fonseca), and mixing it with his teen-aged friends at internet cafés and comic book shops. We observe him during a tracking shot down a school corridor, in slow motion, which accentuates their characteristics and place in life. They look around uneasily at their surroundings, sport nervous smiles which feign confidence and look a little weedy. His point of attack is generically reminiscent to that of your more bog-standard high-school comedy, during which the presence of Christopher Mintz-Plasse's Chris D'Amico, son of a local mafia kingpin, is encompassed with his own, more exquisite introduction seeing him step out of a limousine: he's been here before in 2007's Superbad, and consequently has his star-system reputation toyed with by the film as being a veteran to all this content.David shares some duality with a certain Damon Macready, played by Nicolas Cage. Macready cuts an odd figure, sporting prim glasses and a tall figure; his big, bushy moustache standing him out amidst proceedings as he encourages young daughter Mindy (Moretz) to learn the art of hand to hand combat via gunshots to well protected chests; pop quizzes on heavy artillery and lessons in using knifes. She goes on to become the purple-haired; skirt wearing; ninja weapon wielding Hit-Girl, one of the more eye-opening characters from a film from recent years. Both men fight a system, a large governing body of people too corrupt to especially care for the results of their actions, the system failing to clean up the neighbourhood which Dave inhabits, as well as incorrectly sentencing MacReady to a stretch in prison. When we discover what it is Macready is fighting for, in an affecting scene, Vaughn constructs a particular character's epiphany in discovering the true extent to what happened as if inadvertently uncovering a serial killer's lair, complete with mandatory diary full of disdain and hatred, and the desired reaction is accomplished.The nature of Dave's existence pushes him to order a costume over the Internet so as to enable him to go out and test a thesis he himself concocted more broadly linked to that of why it is super-heroes do not exist. The anger, dishevelment and frustrations born out of the hand life has dealt young Dave sees him long to escape such a persona, or existence, and venture out into another one: one is toothless and somewhat of a target to those whom prey; the other, complete with costume, a mysterious, overly bold, anonymous and quite violent creation born out of his situation in life. We feel Dave is at rock bottom and when he's on the roof top of a five story building practising leaping from top-to-top, before urgently pulling out of the final jump, we do still feel that that's a suicide attempt which doesn't materialise more than a potential vigilante practising super-heroism. Eventually, his popularity with the public sees his fame sky-rocket; his first taste at super-heroism sees him fail overall but his actions get him closer to Katie, so he continues.Later on, their framework encompasses the realising of the importance of sticking to one's true identity; Dave coming to reject his online, super-hero, 'fake' persona as Katie herself realises the shallowness of her own attitudes in initially deducing Dave to be 'of an ilk', before coming round to seeing what sort of guy he is after naturally bonding with him. The argument that it is a character piece and not an adolescent display of gratuity continues when we recall the early, slow track of Dave-plus-friends and match that up beside and a later composition of Dave looking beaten; bloodied; grubbier and less than smart following the plodding through his dangerous misadventure.Vaughn's film is a delicate balance of coming of age with the tale of full on revenge against a system, but to say it goes about exploring its themes, ideas and stories in a delicate manner would be wholly misleading; the film a jaunty and engrossing enough action/comedy tackling notions of one's identity in a contemporary, digitally driven universe and encompassing a fair deal of characterisation in the process, resulting in a film not really as substantial nor as adventurous as either of Vaughn's previous two pieces, but regardless something with the ability to stand on its own. He keeps both strands moving along at equal pace, Cage's is more engrossing; the film paying sly hint to knowing so when it utilises the concoction of Hit-Girl to drive the film's final act on behalf of Cage's plight. Moral panics and general outrage aside, Kick-Ass is an engrossing and substantial enough film to get involved in.",6,1,7,15 March 2011
Ghostbusters," Confident, often brash, depiction of thriving corporatism; punishable atheism and a hybrid of new means to defeat old beliefs in a soufflé of comedy and horror.
","I suppose there is an idea at the core of Ghostbusters somewhere; a high-concept film, about a group of people essentially adopting the role of contemporary exorcists, that straddles some sort of often vacant place on a line that separates non-reality with what could feasibly happen if you were religious. It is a curious thing when a text attempts to handle that of demons, ghouls and ghosts. Deep down, I suppose, it is somewhat perversely pleasurable to convince ourselves of their existence. As years have passed, germs have replaced the invisible monsters that-once-were as the cause for illness; technology has been able to deduce whether or not haunted locales truly are as such while science; theories on evolution and modernity in general has done 'wonders' to disprove the idea that religion and so forth are as genuine as everybody thought they were for so long.There was a line in the Tarantino-penned 1996 horror film 'From Dusk til Dawn' when the anti-heroic lead states that 'if there is a Hell', and that the monsters occupying an adjacent room 'are from it', then there's 'got to be a Heaven'. Should the existence of ghosts, demons and whatnot run in tandem with the theory that there is a heaven and an afterlife? Probably, and yet in spite of all this sweeping modernity doing well to disprove the spirit world and the idea of an 'afterlife', there are still those who remain unconvinced of a ghost's inauthenticity; remain staunch that they've encountered one and remain adamant that the line between our world and the next not only exists, but is thinner than you think. One of the (admittedly, few) charms of the 1984 horror/comedy Ghostbusters is how it exploits the belief of that line while keeping everything as reigned in as it does. This is not, for the best part, an all-out horror film depicting nasty, invading spirits doing their utmost to invade a densely populated human locale, although it does descend into that by the end. Moreover, this is a clash of the old and the new; an unabashed depiction of hauntings and ghosts as very much real but a depiction of science and technology otherwise associated with disproving God; Heaven; Hell and reincarnation through spirit being used to counter said entities.New York City must be one of the most populated zones in the world, but does that mean there'd be more or fewer ghosts there than somewhere largely vacant, such as that attic in an old, isolated English manor house from centuries ago located somewhere in the countryside. Regardless, the leads therein the film discover a fair few of them merely going about their routines in a manner that is underplayed and quite funny but, one senses, realistic to the cause should a large uncovering of spirits ever unfold. Ivan Reitman's film mixes the audacious with the bubble-gum, a depicting people coming into contact with spiritual entities although sadly never really learning anything nor becoming more enriched as a result of it. While the film is quite good fun and often funny, it comes across as too superficial to be anything wonderfully inventive nor much more than frivolously academic. It's often quite childish, even dull in places. Admittedly, where not every film of its ilk can be as good as 'The Sixth Sense', where the presence of ghosts in a characters life leads to an enriched bond with a psychologist, Ghostbusters does hit the odd mark.The film follows four New York City based men, two Caucasian; an African American and a Jew, who set up their own business in a disused fire station that specialises in ghostly phenomena. Initially, the men (still minus the African American) are ill-suited to the practical aspect of their work where the theory is all in the right place. Uncovering a poltergeist in a library archive, they can only run screaming for their lives when it turns uglier than they'd like. Buoyed by their experience, they have enough confidence to set up this business when a university cuts their funding and the enterprise turns into a ghost 'busting' organisation upon realising there's money in making the ghosts go away – a sort of supernatural pest exterminator. Among them is Bill Murray's psychologist Peter Venkman, a man whose womanising ways is evident in the opening and who remains largely sceptical on the whole library phenomena anyway where his partners do not. At the other end of the spectrum is Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler, a dry man and the most intelligent of the four who is too deep into his work to notice the affection shown towards him by their eventual receptionist. Somewhere in the middle is the 'funny-as-Murray' but 'as-good-at-his-job-as-Ramis' Dan Akroyd, who plays Raymond Stantz. Narrative is, of course, superfluous in a film like Ghostbusters; its end-of-the-world routine, as Sigorney Weaver's Dana Barrett discovers a gateway into a doom-laden alternate dimension, is as nonsensical as it gets in a film which might otherwise have been quite intelligently theological. The true pleasures lie in the film's would-be tryst involving the ever-humorous Venkman and the delight in the way he shares his scenes with Weaver, although we do not come to observe much closure to any of it – nor indeed do we Spengler's with the receptionist. The film is more interested in cracking on with its primary tract of special effects and unexplained alternative universes which, one assumes, comes complete with their own dynamic structures but the likes of which are not explored here. But it remains difficult to get angry with the film because it has with it a boyish energy; it does the rare thing for an American blockbuster in actually trying to sell to you this U.S.P. innocently and fondly, as if it cares for it so much and wants you to share in this fondness. In the ever declining cinematic world of 'event' movies within which we live, that alone is justification for checking Ghostbusters out.",6,4,9,5 July 2013
Gran Torino," Low level set, but broad in its explorations of a man with a supposedly concrete opinion on the world whose mind is opened up.
","Gran Torino documents the gradual changing of an elderly man, a young man and the world around them. It's a rare demonstrative piece that places two lead characters side by side, on the same equilibrium, whilst simultaneously having them uncover and discover new things about themselves; life and everything. It's an additional exploration of grizzled old men, whose minds are supposedly so elderly; experienced and 'made up' that they will never change; but actually can, in fact, suffer epiphanies of their own, at this age and at their own pace. The film additionally explores masculinity in a pretty faultless manner, touching on issues and using both of these males, from yester-year and the modern age respectively, as subjects to flesh out an interesting study.The film begins at the funeral of Walt Kowalski's (Eastwood) wife. Various people are paying their respects in what must be a very humbling time, but the item that catches Walt's gaze more than most, which will double up as our own, are his son's children; his grandchildren, of whom seem to treat the occasion in a manner that is rather disrespectful in their squabbling and messing about. Very early on, we are placed behind the eyes and within the mind of Walt – we are fed the adverse reaction to the behaviour of the kids and brought into having the same reaction Walt does when he singles out focusing on them doing what they do. It's a dismissive gaze that maintains its presence generally up until around a certain point, that being when a woman across the street will drop groceries in her drive and some kids walk by laughing. Walt's observing of this sees him get up to go and help, but a young Korean boy named Thao (Vang) who lives next door with his Korean family, stops him when he himself walks over to help. The opinion and viewpoint on the day's youth is framed and shot through the same technique as at the funeral, but the actions of the contemporary youth is different therefore helping in rendering Walt's opinions of contemporary youth as a complete waste of space a mite false.The film, Eastwood's sixth in six years, is a triumph of drama and tragedy; placing two people of binary opposites together on screen and allowing their own explorations of thoughts and experiences to unfold. To say it's a film about a decaying society in which turf wars and gang violence are apparent at every turn that just so happens to contain a character of Eastwood's kind would be doing it an injustice. Walt spends most of his days, now that his wife is dead, rejecting the help from a local priest who wants him to go to confession more often than Walt does; refraining from having conversations down the phone with his son Mitch and generally speaking his thoughts, out loud for our own benefit, about the ever-falling apart world that he sees around him. The seed that the film plants in out heads to do with whether Walt is as stable as everyone hopes he is occurs when his two sons talk in a pew at their mother's funeral; they're concerned as to whether their father can maintain a 'normal' state now he's alone and this kicks off some somewhat ominous preconceptions that might spring to mind.Walt's relationship with Thao is the mainstay of the film, a sort of scouting for talent in an ever-changing world for the worse, and how this talent can be nurtured so as to maintain the natural decency and respect the boy carries; but to additionally instill, or indeed pass on, an odd sort of controlled anger or rooted element of masculinity which Walt so clearly possesses, but holds back for those occasions that sees it necessary for it to be evoked. Incidentally, there are those additionally on Thao's level of whom have their own views on masculinity, and what it's like 'to be a man'; best highlighted very early on when a rather large Korean gangster-come-gun runner retorts about how he used to be similar to Thao in appearance and generality but now that he's an Uzi-wielding gang member, cruising around in a souped-up car with his fellow gangsters, in which threat and antagonism with just about anybody lies around the corner, nobody messes with him.Walt and Thao's bonding comes about in Walt's inability to properly communicate with most adults and Thao's inability to do the same with most youths around him. Hispanic gangsters goad him with slurs to do with his ambiguous appearance linked to gender and the Koreans later exclaim that what he's doing, ie; gardening, is women's work. In their coming together, Walt is able to spend time and interact with others of Thao's nature; calming both his nationalistic and somewhat racist driven persona along with his ageist view on the world around him. Walt's gradual coming around to recognise these things is a brilliantly observed character study on Eastwood's behalf.With Gran Torino and films like Changeling and Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood has now constructed a number of films about some pretty harrowing, rather confrontational situations and subject matters, which just come across as instantly accessible without ever really feeling exploitative. Thao's sister, Sue, is a positive presentation of a female character in an extremely male dominated film and stands up to both gang members and the early wretched attitude of Walt on a number of occasions. The Gran Torino of the title is a beautifully preserved and well treated car which Eastwood's character himself aided in building many years ago and now owns on his grounds. Like the car of the title, the film is treated with the equal level of respect; as character study and observations on the ever changing modern world in which these people live play out.",8,0,4,5 January 2010
Shrek the Third," The entry takes a lot of gloss off the series as a whole; a turgid and rather uninspired entry frittering away most of what made the franchise what it was.
","Directorial duo Chris Miller and Raman Hui are here essentially responsible for going some way in killing the Shrek franchise; their presence, away from the duo of Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson plus Ted Elliot in a screen writing capacity, is an ill-fated changing of the guard very much like the one threatening to unfold within the piece itself. Where 2001's Shrek and its 2004 sequel had a watchable charm, and were pleasant explorations of politics more broadly linked to what is defined as 'attractive' in the guise of the opposite gender, Shrek the Third is a loud; messy; unnecessary and really rather unpleasant edition. Where there was originality, there is now commodity; where there was a real sense of the first two being independent and nobody's fool, there is a depressing sense of conformity; where there was a subversive aspect about proceedings, there is a gnawing feel of pandering of an audience. Shrek and Shrek 2 felt at once grown up but with the ability to encompass childish things; 'The Third' has this sense of just being annoyingly childish about grown up things.Following the lengthy adventures of the titular ogre, he of the Scottish accented Michael Myers voiced green beast, things have reached the here and now; Shrek living with his wife Fiona (Diaz) in the kingdom of Far-Far Away after thwarting evil kings governing huge castles and extravagant kingdoms as well as that of grotesque incarnations of fairy tail materialism in the form of a kindly elderly lady selling everyone things they seemingly need to feel happy. In the third outing, many, no doubt the makers of the film as well, would like you to think that the lead is on the brink of facing his biggest challenge yet: the threat of living as a ruling king twinned with that of operating as a father. The reality of such an 'honor' being bestowed upon Shrek begins to hit home when he takes on certain kingly duties when the existing ruler, John Cleese's King Harold and still in the capacity of an amphibian, is taken seriously ill - this leads to Shrek and Fiona falling afoul of the numerous tasks required in order to be the ruling bodies. Shrek, with things mounting up, begins to feel the heat and wants back to his swamp again. Respite arrives when he is summoned by the dying Harold who outlines that there is an opportunity for Shrek to pass on the mantle to another heir: that of a young nephew named Arthur located a fair while away.Mission in mind, Shrek sets off with his faithful accomplice Donkey (Murphy) and Zorro-pastiche Puss in Boots (Banderas) to find him. Singer Justin Timberlake voices Arthur, a wimpy student at a place hybridising Middle-Ages England with that of 21st Century American high-school. Timberlake's casting, and general use of the school locale as a place rich in the sort of dialogue; caricatures and persona's in embodies, is a sad instance of the film preening to a specific demographic whom need something familiar in their lives to latch onto when they watch something – a far cry from the other Shrek films trying to push boundaries and not bothered if its content felt alienated or off-kilter. It's here the film begins to feed off a buddy-pic combination between that of Shrek and Arthur as they trek back to the kingdom so that Arthur may rule and Shrek can have done with it all; the character a fresh supporting act nudging the previously taut and often amusing presence of Puss and Donkey to the sidelines to wise-crack at each other and offer the audience slight, disappointing asides.Shrek and Arthur are stark binary opposites to one another; they are, like any buddy combination, one another's foils and entrust one another to be each other's enemies for an extended period of time until a reality settles in. Little do either of them know at this point that they're far from it, but the pair of them do have a brooding responsibility of rather large proportions looming on the horizon, in terms of one having to rule as a king and the other to respectively deal with parenthood. There is a sub-plot involving the son of the villain from the last film, in that of Prince Charming (Everett), who's plotting revenge and rounding up all the nasties of Far-Far Away's kingdom to stage an overthrow of the monarchy so as to rule themselves, but it is largely uninteresting. Principally, its errors lies with how it utilises those supporting acts, such as Captain Hook and Snow White, from earlier in the franchise. Their charm always lay in the fact they were often off-screen or often remained in the background filling in for a visual gag or brief one-liner – here, they are brought to the forefront and are lent so much screen time that the appeal of their presence dissipates.There are morsels of a character study with Arthur; his clear elation at the prospect of ruling a kingdom seeing him promise himself 'princesses' and 'castles' which are sure to await him in plentiful amounts when he gets there - his seeing the light of responsibility through what he experiences on the trek home, and then later when he sees the would-be power he's due to inherit being mal-used by that of Charming, is slight and uninvolved substance. The Shrek franchise used to be a satirical, original idea which sent up Disney stories and fairy tales; it was a 21st Century incarnation of Vladimir Propp's folk story jabbing, a subverting of what it was that often passed for high-end Fable-esque drama – the whole thing has mutated into that of a soap opera, a soap opera involving unexpected pregnancies and meek character arcs involving people realising what their 'duty' is. Frankly, we find it all rather dull, chaotic and uninteresting.",5,1,2,25 September 2011
The Hurt Locker," Threats of explosions of both an IED and male ego nature, as Bigelow's Hurt Locker thrills and engages.
","If only more American filmmakers had the lust to take on the sort of material contained within The Hurt Locker and execute it in a manner that is as good as the manner in which it's done so here. If only the lust to do so was as powerful and soul shatteringly affecting as the whole idea of warfare is to a certain character within this film. The Hurt Locker is an agonising pressure cooker of a film experience, an exploration of the male ego in a number of volatile scenarios based within the overall volatile situation that is the Iraq war; here is a film that systematically documents not only what it's like for one man to face his difficulties of just having to be close to the action and on tenterhooks in what he does the whole time, but the overall face of what the Western troops are going through in their darting from one situation to another in a place full of people you really feel don't want them there. As a film exploring the relationship these troops have with their task at hand, it is gripping; as a film exploring the relationship the troops have with one another, it is fascinating and as a war genre piece encompassing action, suspense and satisfying enough arcs for its characters, it is so very watchable.The act that The Hurt Locker revolves around is the disarming of bombs; something that goes rather wrong in the opening scene, a plunging of the audience into the front line of bomb disposal in a sandy, dusty Iraqi street as American soldiers do their best to keep cool in likening the disarming process to a sex act; garnering a permission to panic when some of the tools used for the process break down. The precise nature of the task at hand is very quickly established, clutching at a very visceral and exposed sense of dread instilled within the audience and while we are in the company of professionals. Director Bigelow manages to maintain a steady sense of clammy threat as these severely explosive items linger in such close proximity to the characters we come to care for.The tragedy that befalls the team in the opening paves the way for a certain Staff Sergeant by the name of William James (Renner) to enter the fray, a man that clashes with the chief of the small platoon of soldiers they have operating in the area, a certain Sergeant Sanborn (Mackie), in their attitudes and ideas to the hostile situations omnipresent in the war-zone they're in. Bigelow creates a dry, formidable locale in Jordan; a stunt double for Iraq. Jets soar overhead, a premature explosion of noise as one approaches an explosive item; the streets are littered with items and junk making it impossible to pick apart what is just trash and what might be the thing that takes both your legs; the locals stand and sit, calmly, from elevated positions – often shot so as to appear to be staring right into the camera: at us. These people watch the ensuing activity in the bomb disposal with a baited sense of urgency, antagonism and a somewhat perverse sense of glee. In a lesser, more action orientated and exploitative war film about how titillating the action can actually be, the on-looking; ill-minded target audience for said piece would possess all the characteristics the balcony and window dwelling locals do so in The Hurt Locker – only this time, it is us on that frontline having the onlookers gazing at us.Bigelow's able to do that; that ability to shift tension and threat away from something that might go off and end a character's life there and then in order to focus on something all around the other troops, several hundred feet away, watching on intently and in doing so, manifesting an odd sensation as to whom is in greater danger. We get the feeling we're in that dusty, desert infused zone of hostility; when a gunfight breaks out at around the midway point of the film, itself a stretch of film that'll see the troops' sense of precision and patience spill out into a scenario in which the bullets are flying, the soldiers involved 'reward' themselves with juice as opposed to water, as a number of empty plastic bottles lie strewn about their area - we feel the relief in equal terms.Bigelow casts a number of unknowns in the major roles, helping to heighten the sense of tension by way of actor anonymity. This is very humorously counter-balanced with how she treats some of the bigger name stars at her disposal, and a reunion with her lead from 1995's Strange Days in Ralph Fiennes acting as the best example. James' coming to terms that his own carefree, adrenaline fuelled attitudes to warfare are a threat to others, masterfully woven in when an unneeded spur-of-the-moment hunt for a bomber in the general area of a recent urban blast is a result of his own romping, stomping attitude that puts others not so cocksure at risk. Any apparent parallel between James' actions, attitudes and ideologies with recent world leaders are welcome, but ill-advised. Bigelow's statement on how much she just loves to study these men doing what they do together arrives in the scene James and Sanborn engage in a play fight-come-square off in the barracks after alcohol consumption. After talking of their past failures with women, the two (with James shirtless) engage in a sexually charged sequence of oneupmanship that goes to a level one of them doesn't want it to reach. But that's the way it is; James is lost amidst house-set roof repair and aisles of different cereal brands in an American store, but at home holding a stray Arab cabbie at gunpoint as he ventures off to defuse another metallic globe of destruction. The film is a thrilling, relentless and powerful exploration of what it takes on.",8,5,12,18 March 2010
Moulin Rouge!," You don't have to like musical's to bear this film
","As watching this film was part of my university film course, it became compulsive viewing even though I would normally steer MILES clear of ANY film even mentioned within a breath of the musicals genre. I wasn't expecting anything fantastic and went in with the lowest of lowest expectations, I think this film did pretty well considering that factor. The visuals are pretty stunning. The amount of colour and energy you are drowned in is quite spectacular although this is partly down to Baz Luhrmann's way of doing films, namely with the fast edits he uses. The settings and clothes used were pretty good and even more so when viewing it on 'the big screen' as I saw it in a proper viewing theatre - a feeling I'm told isn't as much present when viewed on the small screen. Although the music itself feels very out of place with characters breaking into chorus' of 'Your Song' and 'Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend' on the verge of the 20th century, it doesn't distract TOO much from the rest of the film, in fact if anything it makes it a tiny bit stronger. One thing that is quite perplexing about the film is the fact that the main character or, in actual fact actor, can sing and sing very well. The songs (all be them modern when compared to the set era) are sung with such grace and passion, it makes you just sit and stare and the activity on screen and in a REALLY odd way, you actually become more aware of the lyrics and how beautiful the song can actually be.In terms of narrative, there's nothing too spectacular. It's the classic love triangle and very reminiscent to that of the situation faced in another musical: 'The Phantom of the Opera (2004)'. The story gets rather stuck. It tries to go up a gear now and again with the Heroine's 'black out' problems and 'the Duke' character getting involved with the Moulin Rouge set up in a certain way but everything seems too planned and too forced for it to flow in a seamless way and for it to be of a level of entertainment that I'd usually enjoy. Still, with plenty of colour and energy and strong acting performances, both in the singing and general acting department this is a pretty enjoyable film that you'll like if you're into your romantic, period dramas with a musical flavour. Even if you're not, you'll enjoy it for its energy",6,0,1,26 October 2005
Back to the Future Part III," Zippy, snappy and thoroughly enjoyable second sequel which reminds us of how good American produced/English-language franchises can be.
","I think we'd all be lying if we said we didn't sit through the final few shots of Back to the Future: Part III and didn't necessarily 'feel' something sad or melancholy wash over us. The conclusion to what has to go down as one of the best film trilogies of all time, a sentiment made even more prominent following recent additions to the respective Terminator and Die Hard franchises, carries with it an uplifting air of pomp and conclusion juxtaposed with a sense of heartbreak in that the only way to experience time travelling adventures with these characters, whom we love a great deal, is to sit through a rerun. There is genuine heart to proceedings here, and we sense the director, a certain Robert Zemeckis, of whom has been responsible for some great work over the years, is genuinely trying new things and attempting to push the franchise down different routes. What isn't happening is what often occurs with certain other sequels belonging to certain other franchises; that is to say, simulacrum-imbued romps of previous entries following that same lead character, of whom was never particularly interesting in the first place, trudging through the same locations and doing the same act with nothing registering and not much of it particularly interesting.The film continues the adventures of Marty McFly, but it veers more away to his faithful partner in time, Emmett 'Doc' Brown, in the fashion the last entry alluded it would: Doc's favourite ever era in history was 'the old West', while at one point in Part II, he stated his intent to dismantle the confounded time machine built out of a Delorean and focus his attentions on the 'one other mystery of the universe: women(!)'. We begin in 1955, and following events of the second film, Marty crash-lands back into Doc Brown's world; he of whom is only just recovering from the events of the very first film. Marty still has that letter from the end of Part II, a letter addressed to him from Doc although written in 1885 having spent several decades with a courier company. It's worth pointing out that the incarnation of Doc that is trapped in 1885 is he of the year 1985, and as you watch and struggle to sync it all up to see if it makes sense, one must battle the wave of nostalgia washing over one on top of listening and working it all out. Blowing up the entrance to an old mine near a graveyard, so that Marty may travel back to the 80's, they stumble across no ordinary grave: Doc's grave from the nineteenth century, and they take it upon themselves to alter the plan by sending Marty back to save him.When Marty arrives back, it is as magical as it is when he respectively crash lands into both the 50's and the 2010's; that trademark-of-the-series crane shot over the town-general is like a friend of old rearing up after not having previously seen them for several years, whilst the gag about encountering his 'mother' (or a descendant of his mother) very early on after travelling is still funny. Initially, Marty struggles; falling afoul of his untamed Western surroundings by very nearly coming a cropper to the local wildlife, natives and the soiled water a nearby rancher gives him. There is some early, if unwelcome, instances of humour revolving around a baby urinating on him and his treading in horse manure, but the general idea is he's ill-suited to his surroundings. The Tannen's are back, Thomas F. Wilson returns as an incarnation of what is arguably the most famous school bully that's ever been put to film; here playing Buford, an ancestor of Biff and Griff et al. and a gunslinger whose reputation is built up through still images and newspaper reports prior to his arrival on screen. When he does arrive, the first we see of him is his holstered pistol filling the screen as he walks through a saloon door, thus inferring the danger and the sense of conflict synonymous with him.Where it is established Doc has but a few days left to live, complications in their plan to save both of them arises when Clara Clayton (Steenburgen) bursts onto the scene; a woman destined by history to perish over the side of a cliff but saved by Doc, in what is an event which alters both history as well as Doc's life. Their coming together is the aforementioned wholesome substance, while providing with Doc with as much of the limelight as McFly is good value. Back to the Future: Part III works through its sense of there constantly being something at stake - we are aware of what the characters have to do, that is to say, something wholly scientific that is yet to have been tried which unfolds in a pre-modern era. If we look back upon this third Back to the Future film, and to a degree the second one as well, with a differing sense of fondness, then it is because that sense of the fire still going as a mainstream franchise hits its third film has all but dissipated from series of the more recent times. We enjoy the places the film take us; specifically, its covering of two people coming to form a relationship away from the core dynamic of McFly and Doc - if there were criticisms directed at the second film for thrashing around too much as it travelled and darted through time, then this is the entry that is grounded in one place and burns slowly as two characters come together and connect. As a result, we are required to hark back to films such as these made at a time when you actually felt filmmakers were trying new things and were out to enthrall as well as touch emotions, rather than proceed with a going through of the motions.",7,2,2,19 October 2011
The Illusionist," Not necessarily a one trick pony but not far off.
","The Illusionist got me thinking; reminiscing, if you like about a filmmaker called Georges Méliés who was a trickster come entertainer at the turn of the twentieth century. He made hundreds of films between about 1890 to apparently 1913 that fell into a long since dead genre: 'trick'. There can be no doubt that Méliés had a massive impact and inspiration on the science fiction genre as well as other filmmakers as a whole all those decades ago with his bamboozling images and expansive imagination. There was one such short from Méliés that had me remembering during The Illusionist and that was the one in which a person stands in front of the camera; there is a 'cut' and they are then gone from the frame thus vanishing. I'm sure audiences in the day were completely perplexed and murmuring amongst one another in the same vein they do at Eisenheim's (Norton) tricks in this film but that's the hook: we now know that Méliés merely used a 'jumpcut' to vanish the person just as we know now that there is no such thing as magic or supernatural powers so any 'wow factor' The Illusionist as film has is actually pretty vacant.I think a lot of people 'love' this film because of its cinematography; its effects and because Edward Norton and Jessica Biel are in it and they share some sort of romance but I feel they're kidding themselves as its like watching Méliés' films nowadays and being aghast at what he achieves even if the knowledge now is common. The 'trick film' genre may be long since dead but demand for period drama romance films that have twist endings seemingly are not. The Illusionist is impressive in its basics and its fundamental areas but it felt like a big ball of gas ever expanding before going out with a 'pop' rather than an almighty 'bang'. Firstly, I was under no illusion (no pun intended) that what I was seeing was mere CGI to myself and a mere illusion to the audience within the film. It is humanely impossible to achieve the things that Eisenheim did in this film and no, I couldn't even let my mind relax and enjoy it for what it was: an escapists dream in a world where magic exists. What the film does is challenge you into thinking: 'what can filmmakers achieve these days vs. what can actually be achieved in real life.' No; orange trees can't grow into adults in ten seconds; people can't bring back images of the dead and when you look into a mirror, you'll see yourself looking back. With this in mind, any clever twist or devious trick the film has up its sleeve is consequently a letdown if you opt for the first option in the quandary: 'what can filmmakers achieve these days vs. what can actually be achieved in real life.' If anything, it's the editing that makes the film look more spectacular than it does but then again; editing can make anything look believable or spectacular: did people back in 1905 or whenever REALLY think Méliés made a person vanish on screen? Likewise, when audiences watched a train speed towards the camera in the late 1890s and some of them ducked out the way, some of them might have been a little 'aware' of the situation but watching The Illusionist in 2006, haven't we learnt anything about 'what we see vs. what we believe is really happening/is really possible.'? To the people who loved this film: obviously not. The Illusionist may have its actual premise as a flawed piece of historical context involving cinema, magic and genre but for what it is as a film, it works. The lead character of Eisenheim is a rounded and likable guy who falls for a girl he is clearly in no position to get; something a few people watching will be able to relate to. What follows is a tricky and devious narrative; something that resembles a snake crawling calmly along and then suffering a seizure towards the very end and wriggling all over the place. The antagonistic behaviour of Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell) who has bigger plans than that of his bride to be and secret love of Eisenheim Sophie (Biel); is an effective villain who demeans and threatens Eisenheim not solely because of his tricks that appeal to everyone but because he is at risk of becoming second-best public figure to a fraud: 'For anyone wanting to discuss a more serious topic, join me for a drink.' he announces on Eisenheim's stage right after a show.What I didn't like about The Illusionist isn't necessarily what I didn't enjoy. The story of a love triangle is dumped for that of a detective route about half way through with certain events although surprising, you can't help but feel will pop back up later on. I don't know if it was the brilliant acting of Norton portraying Eisenheim or the film overall but something felt arrogant; something felt as if it was just going to force you into thinking it was a good film rather than you making your own mind up and this is emphasised in the closing scene at the train station where a certain character works everything out just when he needs to. This scene plays out in a messy way and I am still unsure about how all those memories and flashbacks would come to him there and then at the station all at once and never before  it tries to be The Usual Suspects when Dave Kujan stands on the police station steps; cursing to himself but the build up and the payoff is just not of that quality. The Illusionist works as a piece of entertainment but lacks any real depth if you look deep enough; like a typical magicians trick: you see it and smirk to yourself but it doesn't stay with you in the long run.",6,1,3,1 December 2007
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Fleetingly interesting; moderately engaging animation that's ultimately too spectacle driven and empty to be anything great.
","I like the opening ten minutes of Valley of the Wind, a dialogue-free passage of purist film-making (animated or otherwise) relying on the premise to a situation; the ambiance, put across via the sound, and the mystery of what's going on as we're allowed to build up our own opinions as to what is transpiring/has already transpired. In fact, I enjoyed the majority of Valley of the Wind; a decent film which is about thirty minutes too long and a lot less interesting by the time it' descended into a rock-'em-sock'em action adventure piece featuring a lot of flying around than it was during its opening. And then there is that opening; a sequence set in a vacated space that has, like so many others in this universe where we are, been killed off by a tidal wave of toxins which travelled through the air brining about death. The character we observe stands, anonymous and gas mask-clad after arriving on board a camel sporting similar face wear. They find a child's doll on the dusty ground thus heightening the impact when the harsh reality is put across in the most subtle of manners: no one escapes, not even kids. The character is armed; a weapon that looks like a shotgun is at hand, but surely a shotgun is a weak and quite primitive weapon in an Anime universe that opens in a post-apocalyptic space. Then, something whirrs into view of our ears: it's what a jet ski would look like if it could fly, and it too sports a masked rider looking to touch down in this exact same space...Alas, most of what characterises the above does not last and we've long since lost the immense amount of interest we had in how that opening plays out by the time herds of giant beetles are charging across the screen and tank divisions are firing all over the place, a closing sequence we reach by way of huge airships; giant insects and somewhat heavy handed 'green' political messages. The film is not bad enough to induce a negative reaction, nor too much in the way of being negative to cop any heavy flak - it's more ordinary than that. It does, however, very gradually become less and less interesting as the memory of that opening scene, and how heavy on atmosphere and scenario it was, fades and a newer order sets in. The film follows the titular Nausicaä (Shimamoto), a young woman who, like everyone in this dystopian new world, lives under the proverbial cloud of a recent apocalypse brought about by a huge war causing the planet to be covered by a huge jungle known as the 'Fukai'. Within this jungle lie giant bugs, who are hostile although are not the enemy; one character during the opening even manages to calm one of them down when trouble brewed, an instance lending heavier weight to the glory of the beginning in the fact it sidestepped what a lot of other films might utilise as an opening action ditty to hook the audience in: here, we observe the pacifist alternative.On the coast lies the settlement of the Valley of the Wind, somewhere immune to the poison out of the fact the sea winds keep it away thus allowing people to plough on. Everybody gets something to do when a group of unpleasant warring people known as the Tolmekia drop into proceedings; their imperious blimp quite literally crash landing into their world and coming to force the settlers to work with them in getting involved in a nonsense plot hopefully resulting in destroying the Fukai. Given the sense of magnitude the Tolmekia's airship possesses, not to mention their existing fleet, you have to wonder what they saw in this settlement of camel riding pacifists who can only muster up a shotgun as their weapon of choice. Drawing on what the Japanese, specifically with their expertise in animation, did in The Castle of Cagliostro, and would later go on to do to in Laputa: Castle in the Sky, the film careens us down a route of a grandeur quest featuring each of these diverse parties and their specific goals. This time, the predominantly rural setting veers us away from the 'castle' locale and all its joys of its secret tunnels; turrets and clock faces, whilst we have not quite reached the airborne territories of 'Laputa' which dealt almost exclusively with airships; aeroplanes and fed of a heightened sense of danger its altitude inclined setting had.It's all moderately engaging, with the Tolmekia suitably nasty, and we enjoy the company of our own leads, even if one of the tracts about how Nausicaä manages to save a young grub on this escapade thus righting a wrong of years ago feels a tad pedantic. Miyazaki has created a fictitious world here wherein we are able to just lose ourselves amidst the exclusive nature of the technology and the unique, unremitting ecological system that they've come up with. There is nothing spellbinding about this particular example of Japanese animation attempting to hit new highs in manoeuvring animations away from their cartoony reputations and into more 'serious' realms; the very hypothesis of which they mostly undermine anyway in veering it down the childish routes they do when, as mentioned, all the spectacle takes over. It's not bad, it's not fantastic and it does get a little wearing towards the end. Good opening, though.",6,2,5,9 February 2013
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Curiously uninvolving and rather an odd amalgamation of Forrest Gump met with slices of Magnolia's pretenses.
","Poor Jason Flemyng, who plays the father of the titular character. I discovered somewhere some years ago that he turned up on set during the shooting of 2000's Snatch. claiming to be looking for role behind the camera. Truthfully, he was there so that he could get a glimpse of mega-star Brad Pitt. He ended up being cast as Pitt's on-screen best friend, most probably after a bit of pleading with the director when he realised this'd probably only ever be the one chance he'd get at being on screen with the star Pitt ever again. Now he IS on screen with him again, but chances are he'll have wished it only ever stayed at just the one time after he sees this mess. There'll be few films as broad in scope and journeying but as coldly uninvolving as David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; a film that begins with a relatively hokey short story about one thing or another before branching out into a somewhat longer, more overplayed hokey story about one other thing or another. The cold, distant tone is set early on when an elderly woman named Daisy lies on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital, the wind and rain swirling all around her outside as Hurricane Katrina draws closer, and tells a story from decades ago involving a blind clockmaker. Daisy's daughter Caroline sits beside her, soon to be in possession of rather a large book in which thoughts and memories have been captured. But first, a short tidbit: the said clockmaker unveiled, at a major train station, a grandeur new clock he'd made; one which ticks backwards so as to pay tribute to his dead son and those whom fell in World War One, He was an individual whom partook in some eccentric deeds such as these before ending his own life in that typical manner these 'old tales' usually amble toward; in that he made a point about something dear to him and (cue falsely dramatic voice-over) 'was never to be seen again'. One wonders, after all this, how long the officials would've taken in replacing the clock with a proper working one which ticks in a forward motion so as not to confuse travelers. Is the opening story supposed to highlight how certain individuals cope with the deaths of people? Is the storm brewing outside representative of the underlying quote the film carries in that 'you can't stop what's coming?' or 'you never know what's coming'? Would the film be any different if at all the quirk in the premise were to be removed and Button was a normal guy with a normal ageing process born around about ten years prior to what he was? Maybe, probably and probably not at all.From here, we have the life of a certain Benjamin Button (Pitt) narrated to us by Daisy's daughter Caroline by way of Button's journal of ninety odd years, further still filtered by way of Daisy's own recollections and Benjamin's own presence in these various eras. The film is of the sort that you might stumble across in years to come whilst it's playing on television, the kind that usually sees people sit there and tune in about half way through by way of channel hopping because they're relatively familiar with the premise and like a good sporadic, life affirming film. You know the types, those that watch films but only pretend to actually like cinema. Benjamin is born in 1918 as The Great War comes to an end; deemed a monster by his father and after his mother dies during the birth, he's ditched on the doorstep of Queenie's (Henson) old persons home a wrinkled and ugly baby before growing up into an elderly man, despite only being alive for fifteen or so years. You see, Button ages backwards. He begins in old age and then ends up as an infant.The film preens and provides a deceptive sense of both realism and heart to it as it progresses through the decades and does its best to keep everything grounded, but Button remains in the public eye rather than in some kind of lab having tests done on him. Despite the majestic, high-brow concept; Button's life is turgid and plodding. He's boozing; sleeping with a woman for the first time; getting a job; falling in love at first sight; fighting in World War Two, suspiciously, with the neutral Irish; having an affair with a female swimmer; then the child crush has another man; then she doesn't; then something else happens – so what? None of it makes the slightest bit of difference to any sort of narrative or progressive character study. One of the film's more cringe-inducing scenes sees an elderly lady speak directly into the camera: 'We're meant to loose the one's we love, it shows how much we love them' she says, resulting in the flashing green bulb in the corner of the screen going into overtime when those that aren't paying attention need a generalisation of the crux of the thing brought to their attention.I read the film was based on a short story; one that no doubt maintained Button's gimmick in a sizable manner instead of blowing it all out of proportion like here, in which it drastically shows. The film is a flimsy chain of events, events barely connected to one another as it chugs on through the twentieth century beginning the night The First World War ended and ending somewhere in the 1990s. Nothing's really linked to anything else, there's a love story thrown in and it becomes apparent that Daisy is Benjamin's wife but that's about it – everything else is punctuated foreplay that might lead onto something else but almost always ends up kicking on and into another random chapter in this guy's life. The case of Benjamin Button is indeed curious, the story of the man is dull and consistently flounders.",5,3,4,25 May 2010
Transformers," Talking of Transformers, try transforming all that money into something productive or half decent for a change.
","It seems sadly ironic that the film that kicked this blockbuster 'movement' off in the 1970s was based on a book, that film being Jaws. Since then we've had further blockbusters based on books; blockbusters based on comic books; blockbusters based on television programmes right up to the debacle that is the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy which was based on a theme park ride. Now, it seems, and with the imminent release of a 'G.I. Joe' film and a Transformers sequel, we have a new order: films based on action figures – is that the sound of a barrel base being scraped, I hear? It is additionally sad when a viewer must loose count of the product placement a film contains and must feel distinctly bored by impressive enough computer generated graphics, quite literally flying all over the place in slow motion and slamming each other into buildings and highways, but with which very little else is.In short, Transformers is a pretty terrible film; a film that sets up a scenario, provides us a MacGuffin, introduces relatively limp characters and feeds us bits and pieces of where it's going to go in relation to its story before just descending into near self-parody. I was ready for the film to end after about an hour and ten, but then I wouldn't have got to see Jon Voight very briefly break into a little sprint then later fire an assault shotgun at the latest in computer graphic software. I also wouldn't have got to see the final half an hour of out and out action in which there is a cut every other nano-second and characters, whom up to that point were only capable of realistic enough actions, get to slide off motorcycles under giant robots thus destroying them. I wouldn't have got to see another giant robot leaping over a kneeling girl in slow motion as we get acquainted with what her tonsils look like - then, when all the action has come to an end, there is a really, really God-awful payoff.The film takes time to set up young adult Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), who is living with his parents, goes to high school and desperately wants a car because he thinks it will attract the attention of girls. Speaking of girls, there is a love interest in Mikaela Banes (Fox). Trouble is, we don't like Sam initially. His great-grandfather was an English explorer who, along with his crew in the Antartic, has that oddly familiar cockney English accent most American movies possess English characters with. How does Sam honour him? By selling the equipment and spectacles worn by is great-grandfather when he was struck down amidst the ice over a hundred years ago. Wouldn't you know it, he was finished off by Megatron – the leader of the 'evil' Transformers whom crash landed on Earth centuries ago.LaBeouf plays him with a sense of urgency, a neurotic style which, against all odds, actually works when the attempted acquisition of the spectacles has undergone on the Transformers' behalf. They need it because it tells them where something called the All Spark is located, and that is what the two robotic races want most. But if LaBeouf is passable, then the actress known as Megan Fox is the opposite. She is so magisterially awful that she defies words. The first time she even sees a Tranformer in the form of Bumblebee (aka LaBeouf's car that he purchases), she doesn't even react to it and carries the same, gormless look on her face throughout – she pouts her way through the film, delivering bad dialogue badly and just generally annoys you with her blank expressions.When we first see her, she leans over a car engine, slightly angelic via the music and gleam that radiates off her body she; is the very definition of objectification. The film is really nothing more than a teenage fantasy to do with getting caught in the middle of these two warring superpowers, and in this retrospect, it's nothing much more than Alien vs. Predator but with a love interest – both film's catalysts even took place many decades ago in the snow and ice. How can a film that cost so much and that has so much going on, visually, be so damn uninteresting? It doesn't want to make a commentary on how the new order to do with fear of North Korea and China is in place whenever an 'attack' on U.S. forces occurs; it's not bothered about robots as pieces of modernity and how they can be used well but also misused: it's all about the attractive, faceless female and the big explosions and the awe of it all. This was $150,000,000 spent on absolutely nothing.",4,1,3,1 April 2009
Wimbledon," Serves up a nice love story in a very believable environment; just don't watch it for its Tennis.
","The film Wimbledon does something that, in a way, is rather underhand: it combines sport with romance in order to branch it out amongst targeted audience  in this case, the sport is Tennis. True, a few years ago I wouldn't have touched a 'rom-com' with a barge pole but I've come to respect them a little more what with seeing the one that started it all off (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and really liking it.Although I don't play Tennis, I'm still rather fond of it so I was always going to give this a go as sport as a film genre fascinates me  just to see how they do it and what route they actually take. The situation surrounding watching Wimbledon was rather similar to when I watched Tin Cup a few summers ago; romance mixed with a sport: Golf, something I do actually play and, deep down, love. However, unlike Tin Cup or most other sporting films; this is named after an actual location; an actual sporting event  it would've been a very different film had Tin Cup been entitled 'U.S. Open' and the reasons are evident in this film.Wimbledon is, on the surface; a film with very impressive cinematography, funny and quirky character development as well as staying as real as possible off the court even though on it, it falls short. The film makes good use of its location and the ground scenes of Wimbledon really do put you there as the characters mingle with one another, take time out in locker rooms and practice on the practice courts. The film also moves along at what first appears to be a pleasant pace but soon feels like it has descended into such a 'lets just rush to the good stuff when they're together', you just don't notice the chance encounters that build up. Once the two leads are together, they then turn into such a celebrity couple the film quickly begins to rely on certain things like the two running away from photographers whilst laughing and joking to act as its humour. Suddenly, the 'getting to know you' script routine which was actually funny at times has been made redundant and we're having farce presented to us to act as the comedy. The couple even have time to drive down to the coast during the championships; a scene that tries to create some sort of a bond between the two as they play a game of 'air' Tennis.So, off the court things are a little up and down which is one thing. On the court, things fall a little flat and that's being nice since there isn't much there to fall flat in the first place. The matches are very short, edited in a horrid way and commentated on like they don't even matter. The film goes out of its way to make everything perfect in a frustratingly bad way. The protagonist's father manages to pick up his sons first round match on an old, black and white TV in a tree house  I doubt if I could pick up a first round match between two unseeded players on my freeview digital TV box and I doubt John McEnroe of all people would be commentating on it. What's more, the continuity completely goes to pot at various times; the fact Peter (Bettany) actually skips a round en route during his Wimbledon run is shocking enough but would a Wimbledon semi-final really be played on court number 2? It's things like this that make me wonder if it was done deliberately or not in order to suspend reality. A Brit other than Tim Henman or Andrew Murray doing well at Wimbledon? Really!? Twinned with this, the matches in most of the rounds are so short; you need not show them. You only catch a glimpse of one shot in his opening match. All this build up and then one shot  a backhand winner in the first set, wow; that's exciting. If they'd had the characters talk, read and hear about Peter's matches instead of showing them to us, maybe it would've worked better and the final would've seemed more epic  'Ok, a Tennis match and it's the final: here we go.' Although Wimbledon isn't a bad film; you get the feeling it's not really trying to be a good one. The love story is sweet and there are lots to get a hardcore Tennis fan excited but it lets itself down with nasty, fake CGI Tennis matches consisting of one or two shots and that bouncy, sarcastic, 'all is not lost' aura that it carries, especially towards the end.",6,0,2,13 July 2007
Children of Men," Buckets of both style and substance combining to deliver something quite remarkable.
","Children of Men is, at very separate and reasonably spaced intervals, terrifying; awe-inspiring; tragic; humbling; visually stunning and just generally all out incredible. It tells a very simple story of an everyday and unspectacular man but doing spectacular and extraordinary things for the survival of the human race set amidst a spectacular and extraordinary backdrop. The film is a neo-noir of sorts as well as a science fiction, a war film and at times a horror film when you genuinely feel that 'pinch' on occasion the protagonists are under genuine threat; not from an uncanny enemy but from an uncanny situation. It is all played out with an underlying theme of the social commentary as Britain, indeed the world, is either on the brink of, or has already, fallen apart from within.Indeed, the year is 2027 and the United Kingdom lies on the brink of some sort of society-led disaster following a mass influx of foreign people given the state the world has managed to get itself into. The reason for this is that the human race is drying up; no woman has given birth for almost twenty years  science cannot provide the answer and everyone eventually puts it down to the fact it is some sort of worldwide pandemic invoking infertility. Within London lives Leo Faron (Owen), a former activist turned bureaucrat who will, by the end of the film, have gone on a harrowing journey through grit, grime, war-zones and some situations in the middle of nowhere in which his life and what he feels is his duty are put at immense risk.At its core, Children of Men is a neo-noir of a lonely and disgruntled male lead who, like everyone else in the world it would seem, is very much down on his luck. But the feeling is mutual throughout England and in the classic sense of the term, Leo is given a 'job' or a 'task' by someone that begins relatively easily or seems straight forward on the surface but will entangle and involve him deeper than he would've liked, pushing him to the front-line and back again. Leo can obtain the necessary paperwork ex-flame Julian (Moore) wants in order to transport a yet unseen woman called Kee (Ashitey) from wherever she is to a group known as the Human Project, a task-force dedicating to curing infertility. While the manipulation of time and space is limited only to the fact the film takes place in the future, there are several scenes set amongst a rural backdrop that sees our lead struggle in terms of survival when it becomes apparent that hanging around would be a very bad idea.Life in London sees people hang British flags and cricket bats on the walls of their offices, but rather than act as petty pieces of iconography like they would do in so many other, more inferior films to enforce that 'Yes, these people are English  you can tell because they've got a cricket bat on the wall(!)', Children of Men sees these people as the sorts living in such desperate times that the props on the wall are a clinging on to whatever items that remind them what it's like to be British amidst all this mass-immigration, violence and hatred going on around them. Additionally, it is desperation that sees Leo take the job; there is a sense he is in financial turmoil when he rather feebly accepts the 'busfare' that Julian and her small group toss for him in the middle of the road following an apprehension and a van journey.To say why it is that this young woman named Kee attracts all the attention is almost an unnecessary spoiler in itself but the revelation as to why she is acts as the ending of the setting up of events and the beginning of the journey itself when it becomes apparent to Leo how important she really is and that his job to escort her just took on a little more weight. I also liked the sly labelling of the character, foreshadowing what it is to come in the sense she really is 'key', referring to importance more than anything. Following on from this, and adding to that constant feeling of the presence of noir, Leo blurs the boundaries between right and wrong as he goes against police wishes and even lies his way into a particular secluded zone made specifically for immigrants when he uses a policeman named Syd (Mullen) to take him into the said area.But no one watching can go against Leo and actually want him to fail in his mission. The film, visually, is constructed around the use of several long takes of immense and quite disturbing action in a sequence of scenes not done as impressively as this since Spielberg produced the final twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. Leo dons a withered Olympic themed top with London 2012 on it, echoing the cricket bats on the wall from earlier  it's a clinging on to what we were. However, with an extra 'e' on the end to produce 'London-e' and you have the past participant of 'to do' making it sound like something that has been 'done'; dismissed or has withered away and is now in the past tense in an ominous fashion, such is the apocalyptic world in which Children of Men brings to life and such is the manner in which the film works on so many levels.",8,1,6,16 March 2009
The Football Factory," Stunning look at questioning one's identity and role within a football firm, further still within contemporary Britain.
","At its very centre, the question The Football Factory revolves around is 'was it worth it?' It is a question its protagonist Tommy Johnson, played by Danny Dyer, sees written in shop windows and on the sides of buses as his life increasingly spirals out of control whilst his conscience takes over and forces him to confront what it is he's actually doing in life. It is a question that Johnson asks himself near the very end but replies to his own voice with 'Of course it was!', before he witnesses an act of violence so horrifying that it eclipses anything previously shown in the film. This would've left the film on an ambiguous note as to whether Johnson will now reconsider his prior reply or whether he'll even survive the next ten seconds of his life following this incorrect confirmation that it was indeed 'worth it'. The only thing that taints this final thought is the 'what happened next' caption/image that spoils what is, essentially, a fantastic film.The film was Nick Love's second, second only to Goodbye Charlie Bright which was a bit of a mess. Here, Love takes on substance and he takes on a relevant issue that is linked to today's British culture; that being football hooliganism. The topic may not be as common now or indeed in 2004 when it was made as it was a couple of decades ago, but it exists and The Football Factory acts as a sly reminder it does just as it is a stylish study-come-demonisation of said topic. The film does this through a variety of scenes but takes time to look at the bond between hooligans as this out of control journey takes place amidst a sea of grotty and grimy locations in and around England.The film follows Tommy and a couple of other characters in Chelsea football club's 'firm'. But teams are immaterial here as we look at Billy Bright (Harper); Rod (Maskell) and a younger member of the firm whom it would seem has quite large aspirations in terms of climbing the ladder within the group named Zeberdee (Manookian). Around all this lies the film's anchor; the film's one sane head who becomes a more humble and a more mature individual when he suffers a tragedy himself linked to his best friend of about fifty years. His name is Bill Farrell (Sutton) and he's Tommy's grandfather. One of the more memorable scenes is the introduction of Bright himself, which draws away from both comedy and drama and just becomes plain frightening when the light hearted tone in a pub is replaced by pure menace once he challenges a younger and smaller firm member. The character and his aggressive, confrontational mindset is set up perfectly for the rest of the film. Another scene that compliments the shifting in tone is when Johnson is cornered in some public toilets to do with who he is.The demonisation of being a football hooligan begins with a typical establishment of a night out. Tommy and Rod are looking for women and a drink and eventually they find both in a couple of loose girls with whom they venture back the one of their homes with. The following scenes offer light relief or comedy when it appears both males fell asleep but very quickly it turns into danger when Tommy wakes up with a knife to his throat and a fuming brother of one of the girls snarling at him. He escapes and, in his own words, 'that's when all the trouble started'. What began as a routine and potentially silly 'pick up and easy lay' scenario quickly turns into light comedy and then life threatening before you realise the demonisation of the scenario has been completed when Tommy turns up to work disillusioned, still shaken and slightly frightened. The whole thing suddenly does not look as glamorous.Twinned with this is Johnson's gradual decline into honesty about what he's doing thanks to nightmares and visions, something that branches out into a realm of the uncanny in this refreshing and multi-genre approach that has already been established will zip in and out of comedy, drama and horror. The key scene in moving the film into the third act occurs at a flower stand when someone who has escaped 'the life' tells Johnson to do the same thing with Bright himself being identified as a figure you don't want to end up as; as a figure of such hatred and violence and dedication to these two things that being with him will only incur further punishment.What's interesting about both character's demise into this mindset is how each one deals with the questioning of their own dedication. When Johnson asks himself if it's worth it, he begins to move away and questions his involvement. When Bright's dedication is questioned by the higher-ups after some eavesdropping, Bright chooses the wrong option and ups the stakes by bringing in firearms following the knocking of his ego. Such a scene demonstrates the correct and incorrect choices when this way of life pushes you into a corner and forces you to make a decision based on what involvement you truly, truly want in a hooligan firm. The Football Factory is stylish but doesn't glamorise; it is gritty and involving but you never really have 'fun' watching it. What you do feel, however, is thoroughly intrigued by the plight of this lone individual as he falls by the way-side and questions his own masculine identity amidst a sea of egos and violence.",10,2,2,27 March 2009
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Film-making.
","I suppose when you discuss the most famous boxing films about people who didn't actually exist; nine out of ten film fans may point at Rocky for one reason or another and whilst I haven't seen Rocky at this present time, I would challenge them to give Million Dollar Baby a chance in trying to de-throne Rocky as the film at the top of their particular opinion. I hear and read that some say this is better than Raging Bull; well yes, as a boxing film I can categorically say it is better than Raging Bull but in terms of individual acting performance and character study it isn't  we really got to know La Motta in Raging Bull; we were there through everything and experienced it with him even if the actual boxing scenes in the film were rather poor.In Million Dollar Baby, rather than put everything into one character in a blisteringly entertaining and effective way; Eastwood spreads the study around the whole cast: We discover what we need to know about Eddie Dupris (Freeman) when it's necessary and he fulfills his own little goal in the film; we come to learn what sort of a person Danger Barch (Baruchel) is and his story is more tragic than it is anything else and of course; there is the relationship between student and teacher that Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) share which is the primary study of the film. First of all, I would in no way say this was a typical sports film where the hero starts off good; suffers a tragedy; works their way back up; gets a mentor and then gets ready for a final showdown with the bad guy. Million Dollar Baby sort of starts at point three in the last sentence and then skips the final point altogether as there is no antagonist in this film. Any 'showdown' that you could feasible use as an example would be when Maggie must face up to her redneck family who have shunned her her whole life up until a certain point but of course; this has nothing to do with sports: the film's genre.Million Dollar Baby is a film that studies the space within the frame. It utilises a boxing ring, a gym and its surrounding areas as a statement about certain characters early on in the film in a brilliant manner. Frankie has his office which is set away from the rest of the gym, up high looking down on everything since he's the boss of the place  he is reminded as well as haunted by his previous success as a trainer with his masses of trophies and victories staring down further yet upon him. Danger is a lost and wondering soul who keeps saying he is going to challenge a champion boxer for a belt yet little does he know that boxing has long since retired: Danger occupies the ring most of the time which acts as a large and open space of nothingness as he repeats his dream he will never achieve and his boxing skills he cannot use. Eddie occupies a small room set away from the gym and everyone else; he is secluded from most of the action and occupies the lowest quality dwelling of the establishment; although not a racial element, this says things about his character that he is a cleaner; that his life is now simple after the dizzying highs and lows of his own boxing career.Given these pieces of evidence, Maggie's own space is one of many. She is seen in the ring, in the gym, in a new home and later on in two new spaces which would give away the tragic event that propel the final third. Maggie persists on using the 'speed back' which perhaps reflects she wants to hit away in fast motion the depravity through relief of her bad life. Like most sports films, the middle section of the film usually contains a montage: I recently saw John Dahl's 'Rounders' which follows such a formula mentioned earlier on but cleverly informs us that Poker is in fact, a sport but in Million Dollar Baby; the obligatory montage doesn't seem to come yet at the same time, it's there. What I mean by this is that although Maggie knocks everyone out in the first round; this is due to the fact she has such a drive in her quest for the American Dream through boxing that she really is that good: every time we see the hero wipe the floor with everyone in a montage, maybe we roll our eyes but here I was sold  she's wiping the floor with them because she really is that determined and that skillful.The film also challenges sexuality and what males find sexually attractive in films. Laura Mulvey once wrote that every film is shot for a male to watch and yet the women in Million Dollar Baby are hard bodied boxers who get sweaty, build their bodies and keep their hair short: there is nothing attractive in the film no matter how badly you get turned on by the thought of a woman beating you up. The evidence here is in the form of extremely quick shots of girls dressed in tight bikinis holding up numbers telling us what round it is in-between rounds. This is the film identifying that the boxers are not objects of the gaze whilst Eastwood knows he has to prove that they're not: the ring girls do this. Despite it's poor representation during the final fight where the final fighter is black and German (a black German girl!?) whose trainers dress in shady leather coats and look menacing; Million Dollar Baby succeeds through excellent spread characterisation and a stupendous narrative even if some of the people attending the fights look a little like they don't belong there but that's what the film's about: spaces; wrong place at the wrong time.",8,3,8,24 December 2007
Garden State," Middling low-level relations drama which suffices more-so blows away.
","Sad to say, Garden State is one of THOSE sorts of American independent films; the kind wherein its characters perform tap-dances for their sweethearts and will suddenly make strange, random noises with movements because they're 'unique' and 'no one has ever done that before, nor will they ever'. This, the character deduces, is the credence behind doing such a thing – a justification born out of the fact what you've just witnessed is unique in the history of humankind and it makes them stand out in history as a result. In spite of its own erratic and eccentric nature, Garden State is far from something you have neither seen nor heard before: a sweet, although often trying film; one made with the best of intentions that doesn't work all of the time but one with a regimented character study and a proper attitude towards those with special needs.The film's jarring opening, to a physical extent, in its depiction of a passenger jet full of people going nuts in the midst of what appears to be a failed on board terrorist attack put to some Arabic music does not match where the film thinks it is being equally jarring in a spiritual sense later on. Crammed into the middle of the plethora terrified people desperately trying to remedy the situation sits Andrew Largeman, played by Zach Braff. Andrew sits and does exactly that, sits and stares dead-ahead as if nothing at all were happening. When it's revealed to us that he was merely dreaming, we're aware that for such a nightmare to be accepted during its runtime suggests a seriously spaced out individual. Andrew is an actor living in Los Angeles, but he moonlights as a waiter in an oriental restaurant on account of not being in the big time. Here, he must suffer the foolhardy patrons of a place which attracts the kinds of people who believe 'ASAP' constitutes a word and enjoy their fair share of racial slurs aimed at the place.Disconnected but not yet totally out of it, Andrew is hit with the news that his mother has died back home in New Jersey, and he takes it on himself to travel back for the formalities. Once back, we are struck by how buoyed and exuberant all of his old friends are at seeing him; Andrew, by comparison, is understated and hushed – he has been desensitised by his Hollywood escapade, and it shows. One spends the briefest of moments looking for parallels between the Studio dominated American film-making West and cheaper, less fame dominated projects such as Garden State, and how the former can have the effect that it does on Andrew when all around him are more normalised and more down to Earth people merely greeting their respective friend.It is during an unfortunate incident involving a dog in a doctor's surgery that introduces the one person who lives in his town who'll come to affect Andrew's stay here more than any fallout from a bereavement seemingly will. She is Natalie Portman's character named Sam, someone who's familiar with Andrew's work back in California and singles out his performances as a person with special needs the most. Things progress and we discover why it is that this may have touched her as much as it did, whereas Andrew man is quite enjoying the authenticity that comes with communicating with someone like Sam. Sam is scatty, perky and random – someone seemingly too autistic to feel the anxiety which comes with communicating with someone you recognise. Her core characteristic of lying compulsively is dwarfed only by the fact she still has a Christmas tree up in the corner of her house in spite of the fact it's far from being in season. Andrew does, of course, have the potential for partners at one of the many parties his old friend hosts, but these are fast and loose women - Sam is more 'O.C.D.' than she is 'L.S.D.' and this encourages Andrew all the more.The film is, of course, a love story about someone buoyant and quirky meeting someone the polar opposite but having them fall in with one another anyway. The feminine participant in this case is the talkative, energetic one and this provides the film opportunity to have its exchanges driven by the woman who's ultimately opening up the man's world to conversation; interaction and socialisation where previously there was something more meek. Everything good about the film aside, it does fall back into the sorts of gnawing clichés often synonymous with works such as these while a lot of the behaviour of the characters away from the central pairing and in regards to the supporting acts seems inconsistent with how they'd truthfully react. When Andrew encounters what might be classified as 'grave robbing', I'd expect him to react a little more forcefully and never return to those circles again. But there is enough there to enjoy in the department of key character dynamic, a film that is light and watchable despite a subject matter veering on pretending to be more hard-line and a film that worked better than it should.",6,0,1,30 June 2013
Donnie Brasco," Long, complex and truly fascinating; most things that could go right, do go right.
","The film Donnie Brasco turned out to be so much more than I expected it to be. I assumed it would be some sort of gangster, mafia, 'Goodfellas' type film that had a reasonably light atmosphere and that had two good lead actors (Depp and Pacino) delivering a witty script in an amusing manner. In a way I was incorrect to assume this as even though it started off as what I expected it to be, it then slowly and fascinatingly turned into a more complex, emotionally driven character relations story within a gang of criminals. What also surprised me was that this was based on a true story.The film actually started out like I thought it would; it being reasonably light hearted early on with groups of men sitting around in a man's world laughing and joking over nothing in particular as well as containing upbeat music from the era that even I had heard before. This was counteracted with the two lead characters of 'Lefty' Ruggiero (Pacino) and Donnie Brasco himself (Depp) (who is attempting to go undercover and infiltrate this small gang of mafia hoodlums) merely standing around; talking and acting 'hard' for the opening thirty minutes or so attempting to prove a point over one another that they're the dominant character. Interestingly, Brasco stamps his authority in the relationship by, in fact, beating up one of Lefty's accomplices whom owes him money  from then on in, every thing's fine between the two.What's also interesting about the two characters is their respective situations. Both men are struggling with their domestic situations and consequently, their lives are falling away from them slightly. Brasco's job is starting to conflict with his secret domestic life and Lefty's role within the gang slips away from him slowly but surely as the film wares respectively on.What Donnie Brasco actually consists of is a two and a half hour marathon of fantastic character build up through dialogue and interaction as each gang member dips in and out of the two leads' lives. Trust, respect and interaction playing a big part in a lot of it and this is extremely well put through thanks to a memorable scene in the foyer of a Japanese sushi restaurant. The constant fact we know the truth about Brasco and his links to the authorities plays a major part in actual suspense that builds up on certain occasions; be it the said restaurant scene or whenever Brasco seems to be on the phone for too long. Although some scenes do seem like they drag on a little aimlessly and may lack the punch, atmosphere and actual content; other scenes come along at pleasingly paced times and it's these that definitely have the spark required for true edge of the seat viewing. With a good cast, good soundtrack, wonderful story, a truly fantastic character study as well as an ending that left me as empty as it did fulfilled, Donnie Brasco's story is one that everyone should sit through.",8,1,1,9 June 2007
Event Horizon," Spooky, Violent and Atmospheric. All in all, a good film.
","Event Horizon has taken some basic conventions from the horror genre and mixed them up with a very basic Sci-fi setting. There are characters you just KNOW are going to end up dying some sort of a horrible death, an obvious protagonist and some very clever little plot pointers here and there such as how the ship 'Event Horizon' can travel quickly through space and little things like that that make the film seem a lot more different than others in this cross genre.Several characters put aboard a space ship with a 'no way out' element very much present and the fact it's in space and in the middle of nowhere makes this feel a little more claustrophobic than normal which is a good thing.The twist in the film, I must admit, did take me by surprise and all though afterwards you think that maybe it was a little obvious, it still does set you back a bit. The acting isn't all that good but at the same time, they weren't dire performances. It was the kind of acting that goes unnoticed without any real performance standing out no matter how much screen time one may have. The dark, sinister setting is used very well and it isn't all CGI which has been the downfall of quite a few horror/sci-fi films in the past.I liked the early sense of mystery and atmospheric feeling of confusion almost like some of the characters were private eyes, trying to discover what happened and untangling a mystery that has been made up.All in all, I think you should see the movie and I think, odds on, that you will like it. Maybe not absolutely love it but you will feel a lot better after this film than maybe after certain others.",7,1,3,23 May 2004
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," An unremitting and wondrously directed causality thriller, a film with ample attention to both character and narrative that is hard not to get excited about.
","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the adaptation of the first of three novels in a literary franchise penned by Swedish author Stieg Larsson; a recent series of books which went on to garner domestic, and later international, responses of an highly affectionate sort. Their reputation, or aura, appears only to have intensified following Larsson's own unfortunate passing in 2004 at the age of 50; a tragic happening that saw the series remain stagnant for a few years until reaching the stage of filmic pre-production brought about by joint-Swedish and Danish companies. As each book was adapted into a film, and consequently did the rounds at European festival circuits as well as multiplex cinemas alike, the staying power of the whole franchise has escalated – the effect of these numerous things totalling up and resulting in the much more recent announcement, begrudgingly to most, that accomplished American director David Fincher will be reworking them in the English language. This initial adaptation more than makes the grade, the film an electrifying and inspiring slice of cause and effect thriller film-making; a story all-at-once brutally but brilliantly fleshed out from twisting, turning and often sordid foundations into a cut-and-dry piece we are behind every step of the way.If, in the franchise, there is this overall sense of danger intensification with each new title (the beginning with a titular 'girl' and her dragon tattoo spilling out into that same titular girl and her consequent 'Playing with Fire' which further still leads onto a subsequent 'Kicking' of a 'Hornet's Nest'), then so too is there such a sense as to the general well-being of the central characters in this first film. The film arrives on account of Danish director Niels Arden Oplev , a man working from a screenplay by his Danish colleagues in Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg. It is driven by Swedish performers from an original Swedish text - this sense of two sets of varying people, from differing nations or otherwise, coming together and working towards one goal additionally prominent throughout the piece. Our two leads, a tall and somewhat spindly 24 year old female hacker/surveillance expert named Lisbeth Salander, played by Noomi Rapace, and her eventual ally Mikael Blomkvist (Nyqvist), a disgraced but ultimately innocent middle-aged man, are two people whose binary oppositions to one another are plentiful, but their forging of a team and taking on the elements epitomising much of the behind the camera camaraderie.Lisbeth cuts an odd figure, a shaggy looking young woman with piercings over most of her face; spiked black hair and similarly toned makeup. She spies on Blomkvist on account of a security firm whom want tabs kept on him, a journalist with a Stockholm magazine who finds himself six months away from a jail term for loosing a libel case on a powerful domestic businessman. Lisbeth comes across as a post-modern spin on the old private eye character from decades old. Alone, wry and facing imposing odds in a brooding city locale, we observe her treading a fine line between the moral course and the righteous one never really knowing what to think of her. Like private investigators of old, she watches another human being in the only fashion you'd expect for this day and age: via illegal access to their laptop and SMS in-boxes - all before being caught up in a wider web of smut and danger that she didn't initially envisage.In spite of his initial troubles with the law, Blomkvist is a character the film constructs as homely and friendly; an alluding to innocence through time spent at home with a large, loving group of close friends at a Christmas function. In tandem with this, Nyqvist delivers the subtly disparaged reactions required to have us tempted into siding with him when required as he stands in the street with the news coverage of his case's results all around him. Prior to his sentence taking effect, he is given a job by a company tycoon named Henrik Vanger (Taube); a job that sees him charged with finding a certain Harriet, Henrik's niece, who vanished as a young girl nearly forty years ago. Where Lisbeth cuts a dash as a 21st Century private eye, Blomkvist will go on to epitomise a more classical breed of private investigator; a man of fair age granted that grizzled look and forced out and about into a sea of investigation and logical deduction. In the vein of an American film noir from yester-year, this lead must get the low-down on a specific person who has gone missing.The body of the film is the two of them working together, a happening born out of Lisbeth's independent attitude to down-tools at her end and contact him over something he's missed in the disappearance. Around their coming together lies a delicate, intricate character study on top of a diligent thriller narrative which keeps on going and keeps working as well as it does. Lisbeth is established to despise men with the men in her life for the best part of the opening half an hour being slimy, grotesque and exploitative. The realisation of her Misandric attitudes, more broadly linked to a past tragedy in life, is wonderfully inserted into the meat of the film's investigative strand; her coming into contact with Blomkvist the bonding with a male specimen that is kind, understanding and is ultimately an individual doing what he's doing for the greater good of another female. Together, they battle what essentially transpires to be a bone-chilling right-wing force of misogyny. The film is an exciting, diligent thriller; a film with an intelligent character study and a cracking narrative always asking us to keep up to its speed, the likes of which it is difficult not to whole heartedly recommend.",8,0,1,24 October 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Buried in historical sensibility, with a careful and respectful study of an organisation's reaction to accusations.
","Good Night, and Good Luck is a superb capturing of a tense and suspicious time in which the very identity of certain men is called into question by those who believe they have the power to command and control if it is, in their view, for the good of the nation. The film covers these individuals and their reaction to the accusation the're guilty of certain 'bad' deeds, all playing out at a very important time, both politically and in regards to media progression and overall modernity. Beneath all this is the very gradual, very natural realisation that television and television journalism can be used to the powerful degrees that are possible.Clooney's 2005 film, shot in glorious black and white adding to the 1950s period feel, begins with a montage of various people at an expensive function talking to one another. But what they're talking of is impossible to make out due to the limited time we are given to focus on one group of people twinned with the fact the entire sequence is drowned out by diegetic jazz music compliments of the in house band. What follows is a speaker at the function, talking in front of this array of different people about television of the time and what might become of it in the future. He warns of what it might become, for the bad, and how it'll have the ability to contribute to the dumbing-down of society if misused. We realise, briefly, that during the preceding montage we were merely observing stuff on screen and people interacting without the ability to take in what they were saying. We were transfixed, zombified even, as an hypnotic score and clear things being exchanged were playing out but without sound – maybe sound was not needed. We were passive, absorbing stuff on screen without truly being able to engage with it, much in the way the speaker warned television would become if misused.The sequence highlights the ease in which it is to just observe and absorb, two characteristics or actions one might associate with the masses of items on television in the contemporary age of now. Andre Bazin once wrote about his dislike for the montage as it was a passage of play in a moving image piece which essentially told the viewer what to see and what to focus on, and that it rendered the experience false, pushing it away from a realistic sense in the process as things are progressed in an unnatural manner. What springs to mind when we think of television nowadays anyway? We think highly kinetic, colourful, blurry nonsense for most of the time; punctuated by advertisements of a similar nature. Good Night, and Good Luck sees one man talk into a camera, for extended periods, without much in the way of cutting away delivering important speeches on specific subjects. Quite a contrast, but it's the substance of what he's talking about that counts. The film is about an era in which television saw one man, a certain Edward R. Murrow (Strathairn) whom was addressing the crowd in the opening scene, attempt to lay everything out for what it truly is set amidst the backdrop of paranoia and politics as the American Media and American Government, respectively, fell out over the item of individuals suspected of being enemies of the state.The early signs of this falling out occurs when Clooney's character, acting within his own piece proving he can juggle both roles at once in an effortless manner, named Fred Friendly; a producer of Murrow's talk show named See It Now , is challenged for attempting to broadcast a supposedly Communist story to the watching nation. This jousting that the military, a sub-division of the government, do with the professionalism driven; usually typically egotistically driven journalists at a national TV broadcast centre over the ability to get across information and broadcast 'the truth' to a nation makes for fascinating viewing. In what is a battle of words between a group of people at the peak of their respective careers, and all the power that comes with these respective positions, it is brilliantly played out tale of two sides desperately attempting to get across what they perceive as 'the truth', simultaneously to one another and the watching public. The film is a glorious blending of ideas and historical reconstruction that explores the real-life questioning of the extent of McCarthyism; combining an overall reflective aura with moments that sees the film dip into a more sombre mood; skip upwards into a more positive refrain when the characters momentarily succeed in something and it knows when to deliver the facts and use the necessary found footage to show the man McCarthy himself. There are few tricks and few gimmicks, just an unadulterated focus on the subject matter, seeing Good Night, and Good Luck act as a wondrously guided, well executed piece which informs and entertains in equal measure.",8,0,0,6 January 2010
Big Hero 6," Amusing, often quaint, animation pitched at youngsters & superhero fans.
","'Big Hero 6' is somewhat of a departure from form for Disney - the crisp animation; amusing characters and rapid-fire narrative are all there, but it just doesn't 'feel' like the usual fare from the famous animation studio who are perhaps more synonymous with magical lands; ugly, ruthless villains; muscular heroes; beautiful princesses and mythical adventure stories. This is Disney attempting to branch off into superhero territory - an attempt at placing each of their eggs into a basket which is squared solely at the adolescent demographic rather than the family unit of mum and dad, brother and sister.It's difficult to put here that the film is a failure - I liked its twists and turns where, villain and would-be villain are cleverly transposed; I thought it executed its tonal shifts between action-driven fun; horror and depicting the grieving process really well, but there was something missing from it to have me think it was better than pretty good.Principally, the film's actually rather cryptic title (don't worry, it isn't a sequel - there aren't 5 other entries to see before this one!) alludes to its protagonist, who is named Hiro. Hiro is a boy-genius on the mathematical/engineering level who lives with his brother and aunt above her donut shop in a future-set city which is a (reasonably) clever amalgamation of San Francisco and Tokyo. At least, it has something resembling a Chinatown district and that huge red bridge we'd all recognise in a flash if it was shown to us.A master builder and inventor, Hiro is squandering his talents in constructing inconspicuous-looking robots for a kind of miniature robot themed 'fight-club' among the grimy backstreets of his post-modern home city. Said practice is illegal, yet he persists - a kind of automatronic Eddie Felson amongst a sea of other lowlifes and gamblers who keeps winning big off the back of a boyish grin; innocent voice and some po-faced enthusiasm which has his opponents think they can win easily.One night, he and everyone else are busted after a raid - his brother Tadashi, another scientist and inventor, reiterates that he is on thin ice. Hiro, despite possessing an obvious talent, is sniffy about it - indifferent as to following in his brother's footsteps in studying at the local university. The film provides him with one other defining characteristic: that his parents died in an off-screen accident - usually a sign that an adolescent in a film needs only one more push to completely topple over the edge.Disaster strikes when, at an open evening at said university, a fire engulfs all within its vicinity and claims the life of Hiro's brother - just as Hiro was beginning to realise what a fantastic thing it might be to study there. In order to infer just how much of an impact Hiro might have, the film has him provide a Steve Jobs-like presentation on a recent invention he concocted: millions of tiny building blocks which will forge themselves to whatever neuro-command you provide them with - something resembling what Carrie White might have been able to do with Lego. All might not be as it seems, though, when the one remaining robotic block Hiro possesses seems to want to join its brothers, despite the rest of them apparently having gone up in flames. This pushes Hiro out of his depression and onto his quest to find out if all is as it seems...Hiro is chiefly helped in his quest to discover the truth behind the fire; his brother's death and where his place is in life by a large white robot named Baymax, which was his brother's invention designed as a first aid response to medical emergencies when cries of pain are detected. In spite of being made for this purpose, the robot is somewhat cumbersome - moving slowly to shift a chair out of the way when we first see him activated, despite under the impression somebody is in need of urgent help. As a supporting character, his monosyllabic putdowns and statements at the most heightened of times are genuinely amusing; meanwhile off screen, he is no doubt shipping tens of thousands of action figures and plush toys.Where B-Max is responsible for the most important line of dialogue in the film, that of when he asks Hiro if '...eliminating {the villain} will improve your well-being', Hiro's other supporting acts in the form of a motley crew of young students from the university exist for less substantial reasons - forming a superhero troupe off the back of learning of Hiro's discoveries and leaping into action in a manner that seems to want to be subversive of the genre, but actually ends up being a little tacked-on.The film seems desperate to tuck into the substance behind the approaching fourth industrial revolution, dealing in the process with the co-existence of man and machine and what this signifies for the next generation as one potentially replaces the other. We witness Baymax, an otherwise passive entity enslaved to whatever programming he possesses, used to both help and harm, but nothing especially leaps out at you on the issue. I like how the film seems to encourage aspiration - going to university is construed as a good thing, not to mention the film seems to promote creative thought and imparts a number of positive messages along these lines to youngsters. The film is, however, largely a chaotic blur of colour; quips and spectacle - one that few will find particularly amusing.",6,2,2,12 March 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," Not as stirring as it might have been, nor as worthy of its praise; the film is, I'm sure, an accurate depiction but durge after durge only goes so far.
","I suppose I enjoyed Grave of the Fireflies about as much as I enjoyed something like 2009's 'The Road', a film with an atmosphere and a 'look' more-so a character study; a narrative arc or an actual spine. The comparison to a film set post-apocalypse is somewhat fitting here, since Studio Ghibli's 1988 effort often has the feel that the world is coming to an end; that there isn't much hope left and what the central characters have is the best they'll get lest they be dead. What IS coming to an end, however, is not the world itself but The Second World War – something which, if you're in the likes of Berlin; Paris; Hiroshima; Tokyo, or anywhere else synonymous with the conflict, is going to be a lot less pleasant than if you're situated in the United States, or even parts of Great Britain. As a result, towns are flattened; people are fending for themselves; food is hard to come by and to escape the threat of further dangers; one appears to have to flee to the countryside: this is a post-apocalyptic drama if ever I saw one.Like most of its ilk, story and character sputter to get going out of the fact it's the end of most of what's left in the world and there isn't much left with which to interact. Grave of Fireflies is no different; its elevated status in the popular eye is born out of the fact it's an animation first and foremost, and people often grade such things for its appeal to a child – thus, when something as adult as 'Grave' comes along, hysteria and praise will follow. Additionally, it is a Japanese film and a Japanese film tackling Japanese life at the end of The Second World War; a sum often enough for people to see films from certain countries in regards to certain issues sensitive to said nation as being a bit better than what is normal.As for the film itself, and following on from My Neighbour Totoro, the gleefulness and the ambiguity of the situations young children found themselves in as monsters and supernatural elements ruled their breakaway roost has been replaced by a starker, darker reality. Grave of the Fireflies depicts children veering away from their parents or guardians and into a realm not populated by mythical creatures, of whom are little to no threat, but into the unremitting world of street life in which the reality of actual starvation is very much a threat. We are a long way from the flights of fantasy abound in said example, wherein interaction with monsters and such took kids out of living with parental protection and forced them to fend for themselves.Here, The War is coming to an end and young siblings Seita (Tatsumi) and Setsuko (Shiraishi) suffer the death of their mother during a Kobe bombing raid that additionally destroys their home – thus, they are forced out and about onto the already dangerous streets of Japan. In Japan right now, the skies are red; ash rains down; the rain that falls in black and they have a mere tin of fruit sweets between them in terms of food supply – they must, however, troop on in an attempt to find father who's with the Navy. To an extent, the film is reminiscent of the preceding year's Empire of the Sun; a superior film in its depiction of a young infant caught up in Japan's spree of invasion through the Far East at around this time, events which eventually gave way to the Pacific theatre of World War II. On top of this, there is a burning amount of inspiration drawn from a lot of what Italy was producing in the immediate fallout of the war; these neo-realist pictures about an individual (plus, on occasion, a companion) trawling through the proverbial debris in order to get somewhere that may or may not be anywhere in particular.Seita adopts the role of the lead from Setsuko, on account of being much older; their tale in a late-war Japan, a Japan losing two separate wars to China and the Allies, is an interesting snapshot of life at that time, but no more – a piece not offering as much as one would like beyond the thirty minute mark, by which time we've understood all that's been provided and wait to be challenged with something more. Throughout, the Japanese are resentful and full of spite towards the children; a depiction of aunts and doctors, those of whom you would have thought would show compassion, an instance of few punches being pulled by the makers in what appears to be a set of depictions designed to sync up with the merciless nature of Japanese attitudes at that time.Grave of the Fireflies is no doubt a brave project, with well-constructed, oppressive atmospheres of hopelessness and decent cinematography, but this will only get you so far. The effectiveness of films such as these, projects with later significant deaths and a series of scenes not propelled by narrative but by survival, are often determined by the creativity behind the uncanniness of the scenario, with the likes of 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead scoring highly. Grave of the Fireflies, while competent and well designed, is not a horror film per se; its drama is wearing, its runtime tiring, in spite of it being below ninety minutes and its characters two dimensional (they might be of any age and of any background). Its droll repetition, instead of capturing the desperately sad and desperately slow paced nature of survival, instead creates the sense we're being dragged down the same scenes over and over again – and this is precisely what happens.",6,3,12,9 May 2013
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Brave and interesting period piece about two young boys and their innocent friendship set amidst a backdrop of hatred and death.
","The large fence which separates a young German boy Bruno from another young Jewish boy named Shmuel, whom is imprisoned in a concentration camp, is the sole physical barrier blocking off contact and physical play between the pair of them. Where running; mischief and make believe misadventures with other people of his age were the order of the day when young Bruno lived at his prior address in another part of the nation of Germany, his time in the countryside with his family and distinguished father of the Army sees him only ever come face to face with one child of his age. The obstacle that is the perimeter fence of this camp forces Bruno to sit down and talk with another boy, and therein lies the core of a really affecting from British director Mark Herman, a lone stranded journey into the persistent unknown for a young protagonist as his discoveries and new found sense of adventure builds to a somewhat gut wrenching finale.The opening shot of The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas encompasses the then German flag of the Nazi emblem on a red background and the apparent transparentness these flags carry as we vaguely see the figures of those whom occupy the space on the ground directly behind the flag. It's fitting, as the film is a sort gazing through into the standard-bearing Nazi family and furthermore into the lives of a cluster of people during The Second World War in Germany. The study is headed by young eight year old Bruno, played really well by English child actor Asa Butterfield, whom himself begins to see through all of what's around him through the bond with the aforementioned Jewish boy grows stronger by each scene they share.The film begins in Berlin with Bruno and a batch of his friends charging through the public streets of a German town that is seeing its Jews extradited and evicted, they re-enact war games and pretend to be fighter planes when they aren't mock shooting one another like soldiers; the activity around them bearing no significance nor much interest to Bruno or his friends. While hundreds of people around him are feeling the full effects of a war, something Bruno is ignorant to at this time, he plays out mock war-games with his friends for pure amusement. The boy and his family are due to be extradited, too. His father, Ralph (Thewlis), is a higher up in the German Army and along with mother Elsa (Farmiga) and sister Gretel (Beattie) they venture off to the countryside so that Ralph may take charge of a nearby Concentration Camp. Once there the family takes board in a large nearby house which is isolated from the rest of its surroundings, but Bruno is disenchanted by this new place of dwelling; his prior exposure to many kids his age and his need for expansive locales in which to play gone. One day, he tries to find excitement and adventure beyond the complex's limits, despite being warned not to go beyond them, and amongst the nearby wood separating the camp from the grounds.It is Bruno's tutor himself whom tells him he needs to move away from fiction and more into fact. They are, of course, talking about the books Bruno has a habit of reading but the greater extent of this statement from the author parallelling the lead's arc is fairly obvious. Refusing to heed the advice from his stern faced mother, Bruno heads out into the woods and stumbles across that large looking establishment the film has already shown us out of a window through young Bruno's gaze. In the far corner, sat behind some large construction items, is the titular boy in striped pyjamas Shmuel (Scanlon), who is to Bruno at last a human being his age. As mentioned, the large wired fence separating the two disables an ability to bond in a manic and playful manner more resembling the Bruno of old; instead the film opting for the two to partake in exchanges linked as to why Shmuel is named as such; why he wears what looks like the titular pyjamas and what he's doing in that large outdoor zone. He had friendships back in Berlin, but through Shmuel he learns the true meaning of the word.The film's distinct tone and atmosphere arrives by way of the obvious sensation of having seen the sort of content explored in the film before, ie; The Holocaust, but always with that knowing sense of tragedy and sadness as adults try to comprehend what it is they're facing or going through. Here, it's what you know disturbingly but effectively filtered through an initial perspective of naivety, before things gradually become more obvious for those at the centre of the film. The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a well made and meticulously observed piece, unfolded with exactly the sort of mature attitude required and never for one moment dragging as it progressively revolves around an issue the audience is immediately savvy to filtered through a viewpoint which needs time and natural progression to catch up. The film is an edifying character piece, documenting a specific time in history and the specific, now infamous, beliefs from said time without ever falling back into the sort of groove something passable but ultimately underwhelming such as Goodbye Bafana or Imagining Argentina resembles. Its build to what is a terrifying and distorting finale due to its sudden insertion of a more rapid pace, is equally affecting; a rounding off of a film thoroughly worth seeing.",7,1,2,25 September 2010
Caddyshack," A charming little sports comedy
","It's a shame that the genre of sport when it comes to film isn't as exploited as much as it perhaps should be. Often, the clichés can come thick and fast when it comes to narrative and the characters involved; such as 'the underdog' and the 'underdog always winning in the end', so after seeing this, it was pleasing to see a film that steered clear of this and took a completely different direction when approaching the genre.The multi-strand storyline is cute to say the least. On one side, you've got the tension building up between an elderly golfer and a new member of the club who is a lot richer and a lot louder and as a result, is seen as more of a rival than a fellow member. On the other side, you have a rather bizarre yet amusing at times sub-plot involving the unforgettable Bill Murray as an obsessed green keeper attempting to annihilate a pesky gopher terrorising the course. Throw a love story into the mix and you've got a film. The dialogue and acting really flows out of the actors, especially Bill Murray's character in a number of different scenes and on a number of different occasions. Everything from the discovery that it was only, after all, a chocolate bar in the pool to the now famous 'Cinderella Story' monologue.Rodney Dangerfield's character is another who benefits from the amusing script as he goes around breaking every single rule (not just golf rules) in particularly funny fashion. One scene during an evening dinner/party when he gives his own personal opinion about each guest in a rather outgoing manner is particularly memorable. Chevy Chase's character is also good value as the rather bland but open-minded doctor who can shoot a below par round without caring too much, he also eats off the script which springs to life at clever moments.On the down side, despite the quaint little narrative, there is never much of a plot. Although this is dominantly a golf/sporting orientated film, there is never really an atmosphere of sports nor is there much tension as the opposing sides in the form of the rich old men at the club attempts to build up. The reason behind this is that with Bill Murray's characters sub-plot inter-cutting now and again, the comic relief distinguishes any atmosphere we might previously have felt.The film also seems to hover around on young caddie 'Danny' as he deals with life at the golf club and seems forever chasing his own personal 'American Dream' which, although when compared to all the other characters' aims is a lot more long term, it just seems to weigh the film down in a rather strange way as any scene with Danny, you feel isn't particularly important as the real stories/comic interest are lying with most of the characters. This slows the film down slightly but there is enough of everything else to keep it interesting until the final match, which actually seems quite tame itself until the little twist you eventually see building up during the game.I think you'll enjoy this film in places and depending on your mood whilst you watch this, there's a high chance you'll like it overall.",6,3,6,19 January 2006
8 Mile," Taut and restrained account of a man digging on through the hostilities of his life, as the allure for escape into music and away from everything else takes stage.
","As the credits to 8 Mile roll, such a thing is accompanied by one of Eminem's songs; a song which I initially had a hard time differentiating to that of his many other records and thus merely sat accordingly. As the text continued to roll across my screen, I began listening to it more intently, and then, as half a minute or so passed, I realised I was probably listening to it as intently as I had ever done so any previous Eminem track that I'd previously caught through whatever means. Against most odds, and this is the startling thing, I actually came to begin to rather enjoy listening to it; actually came to begin to rather enjoy listening to the pace and tempo of the thing; actually came to rather enjoy the pace and rhythm of what I was hearing combined with what it was I had just seen in the film itself, something I was still in an immediate process of digesting anyway. Such a moment caught me off guard, but told me deep down that 8 Mile had worked.Eminem is an American rap artist whose successes around the turn of the 2000's somewhat lingers in the backgrounds of my memory. Around about the time of the film's 2002 release, and a further few years before that, I recall he was mostly all the rage amidst those then of my age – for what reason, I knew not then and know not now. I'd heard the guy's music, but didn't pay an awful lot of attention to it; the tracks striking me as more often than not just a lot of angry talking, bordering on ranting, in a rapid manner which was peppered by four lettered words that became even harder to decipher when your only true exposure to it was listening to 'Real Slim Shady' on the radio during Sunday's Top 40 count-down – this a weekly occurrence that always saw the whole thing cut to ribbons out of censorship anyway. Curtis Hanson's 8 Mile puts all of these things aside and tells a cutting tale of a man, whom does not share Eminem's true-to-life name but is nevertheless an interesting case of what appears to be an example of pseudo-biopic film-making, with a passion and a skill slowly finding his forte with such things whilst learning of some harsh realities along the way.Hanson begins proceedings in a grotty public lavatory in a dingy night club, at least it looks like a night club, because the young and rather innocuously named Jimmy Smith is there practising for the building's true purpose: to host these things called rap-battles that pit two guys on stage and has them face off with each other via their lyrical abilities so as to verbally shoot the other one down. Our Smith, stage-named B-Rabbit and played by Eminem, stares at a cracked mirror amidst the filth, a literal reflection of a man whose skills and place in this world at this point are unfixed. He exits for the stage, a lone Caucasian amidst many African-Americans, upon winning the toss of the the coin, he concedes to go second in what is a defensive act that sees him on the way to 'choking' and leaving embarrassed and beaten having been unable to get started.Hanson paints an enlightening and rarefied image of this underworld of rhymes and egotisms, his general locale is pent-up and aggressive with one looking to get the better over any one other; but it is not necessarily an existence imbued with violence and criminal gamesmanship, rather, rap battle duels are limited to that of verbally berating the opponent in a controlled manner in a specified zone most can occupy. This is a world full of young, impetulant youths angry and embittered and yet words, not guns, often drive the hostilities; words whose perpetrators must think creatively and logically so as to formulate and be able to use as ammunition to force victory. These face-offs carry with them concealed aggression, but are calculated and organised in a methodical and mature manner: if you win the consensus of your audience, you head through to the next round in a tennis-bracket inspired set up. By day, Smith is a factory worker with a hard-up boss and dreams of being a rap star, the lyrics to his tunes of which he scrawls down on his palms so as to remember. Work seemingly consists of walking a few feet every so often in a steel-mill and hitting a button before waiting a few seconds and repeating the process; his bus rides to this place are fraught with roadside iconography establishing his dishevelled roots here, in 1995 Michigan; streets consisting of seedy looking bars and such that are shut down but probably not looking too dissimilar now to what they resembled when they were open and thriving.The presence of Smith's mother Stephanie played by Kim Basinger, working with the director again after L.A. Confidential, and her daughter Lilly (Greenfield), whom she had with a temperamental Michael Shannon character named Greg Buehl, pepper proceedings. These people face eviction from their trailer park home, as Stephanie strives to win big at Bingo and provides Smith with extra incentive to succeed at his dream. Brewed in amidst all of this is Brittany Murphy's character Alex, the object of most of the men's gaze and Smith's constantly on/off girlfriend in what is a strand that amply supports the primary content. But Hanson's film is first and foremost the tale of Smith chasing his dream of becoming a musician, a goal verbally reiterated early on by a connected character whose monologue on demo tapes and such lays things out and allows Eminem's character to undergo a transition beginning and ending on the stage which rejects the initial paths it alludes to us it will venture down, in what is a well made and intriguingly downplayed drama in spite of the lead's raging fame.",7,1,2,12 July 2011
Shrek 2," Snappy, wholesome and very funny in a number of places; Shrek 2 extends the invigorating politics of the first into a finer and more rewarding second showing.
","This first Shrek sequel loses none of that high and mighty but exceedingly mirth-inducing attitude with which it has in regards to fairy tales; nursery rhymes and mythical tales. Indeed, the film opens in the vein of the first as if beginning with a fanciful fairytale we've all heard before when it establishes one character: 'Rode. For days and nights on end. Through scorching deserts and across mountain ranges. To a far off locale, and all in the name of true love'.......but then at the end of it all, complains about the blisters he got in doing it after having been more than disgruntled at what awaited him in the bed housing his damsel. When we begin, the titular Shrek (Myers) and his new wife Fiona (Diaz) are living the dream; the uppity old ogre from the first film has found somebody he doesn't mind within the radius of about fifty miles of the locale that is his secluded swamp, whereas Fiona has, in her own mind, found that true love-cum-happiness she always wished for - albeit under a differing guise to what she first presumed. Their co-existence is established via an array of popular movie moments, one romantic instance of which calls to mind that of 2004's other seasonal blockbuster Spider-Man 2; a semiotically driven instance bringing to mind the intense ties those predominant characters shared in said film and utilising that to act as an extension to where Shrek and Fiona are in relation to each other here. As was in the first film, Eddie Murhpy's character Donkey is still knocking about and as was in the first film, he's remains both overstaying his welcome in the company of the protagonists and annoying them with his chatter.This domestic bliss is broken by the arrival of a royal troupe of trumpeters and their messenger, a statement of which arrives with him informing Fiona that she must, at once, report home to her parents in a place known as The Kingdom of Far Far Away which they rule. Gripes aside, the threesome push off; once there, the kingdom being a very different locale to that of what a sheltered existence in a tower for most of one's life or the living in a swamp off of the land is like. Arriving to a track entitled 'Funky Town', instilling a sense of niche, corporate credibility about proceedings, the trio uncover a place steeped in materialism; capitalism; supply; demand and a place which actually contains streets, roads, laws and an order - Shrek and the crew have their work cut out. The fact these fish are out of their proverbial waters are the least of their worries, Shrek's clashing with the John Cleese voiced King Harold, Fiona's father, the result of initial coming-togethers going awry; the expansive first dinner they all have together seeing Shrek positioned in front of a stuffed hawk mounted on the wall up and behind him as the proverbial vultures circle. Harold and Shrek's clashing carries with it an amusing undercurrent of class distinction, the fact Harold et al. are humans and Shrek is an ogre (running on how we all know human's react to such) are surface binary oppositions to that of Shrek's humble, essentially farm based background, up against that of the king and queen's rich, expansive and affluent lifestyle in this consumerist driven Dystopia.Things are complicated further when a hideous creation in the form of The Fairy Godmother (Saunders) arrives, a sort of grotesque extension of this world's ideologies; a celebrity in these parts whom whips crowds into frenzies and plays up to a kindred, spirited surface persona but is internally morally decrepit. Here is a creature whose idea of happiness is in the form of a tonic designed to gloss over all of life's problems, before quick-marching to a designated point in one's existence which encompasses artificially photogenic partners; lots of clothes and labels on top of rich, faux-rewarding surroundings â€“ much rather than a conclusion someone may have reached naturally with somebody else for what it is they are.The film gleefully covers Shrek's exposure to such a world, threatening to contaminate his own beliefs and question his own position on such things in relation to Fiona, with whom his life was perfect before any of this even arrived. Oddly, however, it is Harold's own sub-plot which is arguably more affecting; a trip to a dingy tavern in a disguise the bouncer easily sees through not only implies a prior history of turning to these means to sort out a problem, but allows somewhat of a show-stealing turn to arrive in the form of a mercenary named Puss (spoofed from the centuries old Perrault 'Booted Cat' novel) and voiced by Antonio Banderas in a send up of his Zorro role long enough after 1998's The Mask of Zorro but too prematurely in regards to said film's 2005 sequel.If anything, Shrek 2 is better than the first; a more involving effort, a film taking the politics and overall study with which was imbued in the first and advancing it a step further in what is a more exciting and substantial piece. Its narrative is additionally far more interesting; it makes better use of its antagonist on top of the film just having more of an immediacy to it and its attention to character is not limited to that of its leads, thus resulting in a better and more rounded piece. Some of Shrek 2's scenes of great drama hinge on instances such as an internal conflict of morals an elderly king has regarding his daughter's future; in the first, needlessly extended scene of an escape tidbit from a dragon's lair or sub-Graduate 'must stop the wedding' sequences were utilised as more spectacle driven incidences of drama and peril. Smart, wry and devilishly funny, Shrek 2 is a more than substantial animation.",7,1,1,11 May 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino delivers another devilishly good film experience and proves he can bring his own style to a revenge film that purposely cuts back on substance.
","Yes, Kill Bill Volume 1 is a definite exercise in style over substance, but this isn't just anybody's style, this is Tarantino's style and what a style to possess. If his preceding film, Jackie Brown in 1997-98, was all characters and attention to detail spanning over two hours then Kill Bill is him letting his hair down and giving us an out and out visual-fest of colour, effects and violence delivered in double quick time; well, double quick compared to Jackie Brown and its brilliant study. But Tarantino had proved his worth when it came to out and out substance in films. His attention to a love story and character development in Jackie Brown came after Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, two of my favourite films told with such confidence and in such an entertaining way, the latter of which has since embedded itself into modern folklore, is stone wall proof that he can do it when he wants.It's not that Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is an example of Tarantino not wanting to do what he can do, but more so a relaxation of complicated and developed films with narratives about realistic people. Yes, you can deem Pulp Fiction complicated even though it has inspired countless other films because there are some people even now that, on a first viewing when not familiar with the genre and influences, cannot fathom how one character can be alive at the end even though he shouldn't be.On first view the film does come across as a flat out adventure, a one lined journey about one person in a routine revenge narrative driven film. But it's this familiar template that Tarantino's uses to place his own unique touches that he is so able to bring to a piece of text. If Pulp Fiction was so memorable, it was so for bringing life into an old genre full of stereotypes as noted by many. Here, Tarantino brings his own breath of fresh air or style to the well worn start revenge flick. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 begins with the sort of introduction you might not expect from Tarantino, certainly not from the very opening. There is no long tracking shot of a static woman on a moving walkway or guys calmly sitting around a table discussing Madonna. Instead we get black and white, panting and a bloodied woman whose image is juxtaposed by the calm and methodical speech from a man named Bill (Caradine). A few lines of dialogue pass and the woman is shot in the head.What develops is a revenge film as told from this woman's point of view, The Bride (Thurman), a nameless (for now) antihero on a mission that will see her have to undergo a process as she plots her way to the ultimate goal of revenge. What's great about the revenge process from this position and similarly so in one of my favourite films entitled Payback, is that the antihero lead has just about nothing to loose and thus, they go about their mission in just about the most ruthless and unforgiving way possible. Their enemies think they're dead; they accept they've been to Hell and back and nothing else could be as bad as their prior tragedy and they go hell for leather in trying to attain the status of 'even'.The Bride visits Vernita Green (Fox) after treading through some child's toys on a lawn, mise-en-scene that leads the audience to realise it is a house that inhabits a child. Vernita opens the door and there is a flashback (a Tarantino trademark) before a fight erupts immediately placing the audience in another juxtaposed situation: this woman whose been shot in the head and has been through Hell versus one of her enemies who it now seems has a young child. There is a brief fight before Vernita's child's bus stops outside and, echoing the tactic in Reservoir Dogs during the ear scene, there is a break in proceedings further plunging the audience into a realm of either frustration or unfamiliarity. How many other films would have finished the fight and ignored the 'pit-stop' routine? Tarantino re-announces his style from here and continues throughout in a barrage of memorable scenes.But Kill Bill is really a furtherance in feminism. The entire assassination gang, bar Budd (Madsen), are female and the sexually active male nurse in The Bride's hospital wing gets his just deserts from said strong, independent female lead who takes no prisoners. A similar scene happens during a flashback scene involving the female Japanese character of Gogo (Kuriyama) who asks the question 'who is penetrating who now?' as she kills another potentially sexually active male in a similarly nasty manner.The film builds to a climax that certainly delivers but not after delivering flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks when introducing Lucy Lui's O-Ren Ishii. The character of Bill is kept out of shot alá Marcellus Wallace and talks Elle Driver (Hannah) out of killing The Bride while she's still in a coma because it's not the 'honourable' thing to do; while clutching a Samurai sword which of course epitomises the ideal of honour amongst ancient Japanese warriors. Volume 1's final fight scene is all guts and gore but the images are juxtaposed with pinball noises and ten pin's clattering as the light and colouring changes brilliantly and dramatically, although my favourite touch is Sophie's (Dreyfus) ringtone which is 'Auld Lang Syne', a song that includes the lyric 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?'. The Bride's reply would probably be a resounding 'No'.",9,1,3,12 October 2008
Saw II," Saw II is really just an update of the first film but with more people and a larger location, although that doesn't mean it has to be disappointing.
","Saw II has that uncanny ability to make you feel as you're watching one of the many, many American TV serials that have popped up in recent years. You know the sort; the drawn out and somewhat repetitive sequence of events that lead from one dark or dingy set piece onto another. The element of crime and murder twinned with the fact many-a police officers are running around trying to solve a crime in progress just cements the feeling and it's this rapid approach to the material that hammers home the race-against-time atmosphere throughout. But in essence, this is alright if done sparsely and within moderation  the reason I hate most television serials has a lot to do with the drawn out manner they take to the material; from face value, characters can travel a lot of distance over a lot of time and not really achieve much which is frustrating, but Saw II seems to get down to brass tacks and just gives you what you want.This 'what you want' is a mixture of suspense; race against time; something emotionally involving at stake and generally horror and/or gore. They are the hallmarks of generic horror and Saw II delivers perhaps not what you demand but what the genre demands on top of a grungy and depressing approach to cinematography that compliments the enclosed and bleak setting. Much like the first Saw film, unknowns are trapped in a room with no initial knowledge of how they got there  things will become clearer at nicely spaced intervals.They are there, of course, due to the actions of themselves but the instigations of one other man; he is Jigsaw (Bell) and in Jigsaw we have a villain well suited to the piece. As a horror villain, Jigsaw is not what we expect: he is old, decrepit and barely able to breath or talk. The effectiveness of Jigsaw is in his presence and his 'type' of villain. Saw II is the sort of film that will have most of its viewers squirm in some fashion; it taps into basic fears and phobias but does not make an obvious study. Whether someone's fear or phobia are needles or enclosed spaces, Saw II carries an unpleasant but effective atmosphere and the idea that its villain is an old and incapacitated old man complete with breathing apparatus adds to the squirming nature it carries  do we like seeing an elderly and frail man being threatened and knocked about like this despite his clear delicate complexion? But of course this effectiveness in appearance of a character can only carry as many cons as it can pros. This is because the emphasis on the weak and frail is so apparent and made to be so effective that it's almost impossible to believe that someone of this disposition is able to own so much real estate and is able to set up so many elaborate traps, not to mention to be able to handpick people out of society and place them there. Jigsaw is an interesting character; the sort of character that by appearance and build appears weak and useless but is constantly in control of any given situation and given a few twists that unravel towards the end, seems to be able to remain deadly calm even when the ball isn't entirely in his court.The victims this time range from big, broad, egotistical Hispanics to young and insecure kids that are barely teenagers but act as a link to the bigger picture. This is in opposition to two guys, in a room, with restraints around their legs. Saw II's hook is that these several people are given the freedom of their surroundings and the surroundings are an entire house with extra rooms complete with individual traps and 'tasks' of their own. One of this Saw edition's grizzlier scenes involves a woman having to go down into a pit of syringes in order to fetch a key  it's a set up or an idea similar to Fincher's 1995 film 'Se7en' with the idea that people pay for their 'sins' (or crimes in Saw II's case) by way of meeting them head on in an orgy of terror and pain. On this occasion, the person down there (or supposed to be down there) distributed the syringes, complete with drugs, and must now meet his wrong-doing head on.The film forces its race against time idea upon us via inclusion of a poisonous gas slowly making its way through the victims lungs  if they don't solve the bigger picture, they all die. This actually works against the film in the sense one of the reasons I liked the first Saw was that they had time to think, work things out and do their best to escape. Here, they have limited time and I feel the film would've been better without the inclusion of the gas. What's at stake here is the well being of the hero's child, Daniel (Knudsen), it is policeman Eric's (Wahlberg) problem so remove the poisonous gas and allow the many traps and general desperation of the captives to act as the primary threat to the well being of Daniel. Indeed, when the captives find out who Daniel is this should act as a further dramatic twist but it falls marginally flat due to the fact we know the gas will kill everyone eventually anyway, regardless of how much everybody knows. The film is by no means great but as a dramatic and grungy thriller with a constant whiff of unpleasantness, Saw II works on a basic dramatic and horrific level.",6,0,0,27 November 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," It's still the fast talking, slickly delivered, blackly comic and severely entertaining flick it always was.
","From Dusk Till Dawn is the original 'Grindhouse' Tarantino/ Rodriguez featurette, a film that feels like one person has created one half before the second guy just takes over and finishes things off in their own style. It is the perfect balance; Tarantino, who was best known for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction at the time, begins the film with his crime fuelled tale of two lowlifes getting up to crime-driven no good before Rodriguez takes over to create an explosive finale which brings about an element of the guilty pleasure as violence, entertainment and convention round things off.Like most films penned by Tarantino, From Dusk Till Dawn begins in a road side location-come-diner (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Natural Born Killers) and sees a perfect balance of terror, suspense, dry humour and that wonderful dialogue Tarantino is able to come up with when a local trooper delivers a story to a store owner about how he had a recent case of food poisoning. The immediacy of the two would-be lead characters is a jolt to the audience, foreshadowing the 'jolt' Tarantino will give us later on when he introduces elements of the uncanny at the strip club. But the terror of the hostage situation, the dry exchange between the store worker and one of the leads and the consequent exiting of the store as it goes up in flames is a one sequence example of the sort of cocktail Tarantino can fabricate in his screenplays, all demonstrated in the opening scene.The two leads are the Gecko brothers, Seth and Ritchie played by George Clooney and Tarantino himself, respectively whom are both on the run from American law enforcers following a bank robbery and a blood bath of an escape. This is something the trooper establishes happened, thus implanting a dangerous image of the brothers whilst they're off screen. What transpires is a brief journey through the desert, an incident with a hostage and then an acquiring of a motor-home thus enabling the brothers to get across the border camouflaged. When they do cross the border, it is the signal for the film to change gears and begin to mutate into something else but not without wonderful touches as applied by both writer and director.Initially, my eye is drawn to the casting and the twisting of the rules that entails, echoing the twisting of the genre the film will undergo at the strip club. Prior to From Dusk Till Dawn, Julliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel had played characters in Tarantino penned scripts; only they played Mallory Knox, the psychotic and deeply disturbed serial killer in Natural Born Killers while Kietel played Mr White and Winston Wolf in two separate Tarantino films. Their characters in this project are far more muted than in those films, with Kietel not even dropping an f-bomb despite being teed up to do so. On the contrary, Clooney is cast as Seth Gecko, a loose and rather aggressively criminal who will kill and maim without much second-thought and this goes against the role he was best known for at the time, that being as a character in the rather reserved TV series 'ER'.The scenes involving Gloria (Hillhouse), a hostage the Gecko's have taken, act as scenes prolonging both Tarantino's style as a writer and an establishing of character traits. The exchange between Gloria and Seth is brilliantly slick in its delivery and pacing whilst maintaining a distinct tone of menace that the film wants the brothers to continue to have. It also goes a long way to prolonging the trait Ritchie carries to do with sexually driven desires of malice towards women when he does what he does to Gloria and this in turn plants a seed in the audience's mind. So by the time the brothers have apprehended the Fuller family and Juliette Lewis' character has entered a room in a swimming costume, the audience is fearing the worst. Additionally, the actress that plays Gloria was Tarantino's acting coach and he's quite clearly, perhaps disturbingly so, cast her as the hapless female who has what happens to her, happen to her as a direct result of Tarantino's character.The Fuller family are indeed made up of Kate, Jacob (Kietel) and Scott (Liu); the latter of which wears a visual clue on his shirt in 'Assault On Presinct 13' as to the 'last stand' scenario the film will adopt later on. When everyone arrives at the Titty Twister club, Jacob says a prayer in the form of 'out of the pond and into the fire', again foreshadowing that entering this establishment is a big deal to the film and doesn't just act as a waiting spot. But the uncanniest of incidences follows Chet's (Marin) 'pussy' monologue at the end of which he leans over into the camera and, rather eerily so, utters an obscenity directly at us as we look up at him from ground level. It's a bizarre occurrence and for the film to suddenly break the fourth wall creates an uncanny sensation that all is perhaps not quite right with this place. Unfortunately, the tactic might be lost on most viewers due to the absurdity, and possible hilarity, of the preceding monologue.Once in the strip club, the film cools off for a while and becomes something entirely different, but something still thoroughly entertaining. There is a rather random five minute or so dance from Selma Hayek's 'Santanico Pandemonium', during which Tarantino gets to indulge in his 'fondness' for feet, a scene that he wrote for himself to partake in. Regardless, From Dusk Till Dawn remains a favourite of mine; on a film-making level and certainly on a guilty, more entertainment driven level.",8,0,0,21 March 2009
Jurassic World," Tough to truly dislike, and I'm glad I took the time to track it down, but Jurassic World does not uproot trees.
","Films such as 'Jurassic World' are so often the most difficult to review; you find yourself in a strange place wherein you really want to like it, but must remember that impartiality and balance are so crucial as to forging views on anything, that to resist them means to completely waste your time in the first place. There is not, in many ways, much to remark about Jurassic World: it does not overstay its welcome; its second unit content is exciting; it a least attempts something resembling character study and manages to take a franchise into new directions without wrecking too much of the nucleus of the initial idea. Unlike, say, recent 'Die Hard' or 'Terminator' entries.Many of the ideas coined in the aftermath of the blow-away 1993 success 'Jurassic Park' by critics and theorists remain; observations which were never meant derogatorily, but are either included here out of a rooted urge to stick to the source material or by way of academic homage. Thus, much of what was written twenty years ago with regards to the symmetry between a theme-park ride and a movie going experience with films such as 'Jurassic Park' still stand. I believe it was Tom Shone who once remarked that, in a post 1977 Star Wars era, cinema/film-going experiences are becoming more like trips to an amusements park with each passing summer-blockbuster line-up.In Jurassic World, a tracking shot once we are in the park after some formalities is deliberately set up so as to resemble a standard person's height as the park is entered and a woman steps before us with the line 'Welcome to Jurassic World' – it is the closest to a process of breaking the fourth wall that one can realistically come without cordially turning to the camera and asking the salivating multiplex audience if they are ready for what they are about to experience over the next 90 minutes. It does, in many ways, call to mind Spielberg's self-conscious references to the various items of 'Jurassic Park' memorabilia which were actually on sale in shops anyway in 1993 by way of his otherwise needless tracking shot around a gift-shop full of theme park memorabilia towards the end of that film.Two strands set the film running, the likes of which somewhat clumsily merge towards the end. The first revolves around two minors: essentially one child and a teenager with Justin Bieber locks and an eye for the girls. They head to Central America and Jurassic World: a realisation of John Hammond's dream to one day build a theme-park where the dinosaurs are the attraction. This is doubly rewarding, because the head of the park is the aunt Claire, played by Bryce Dallas-Howard.The second strand follows an Alan Grant-knock off by the name of Owen Grady, played with a really good balance of energy and vulnerability by Chris Pratt. Grady works in a strange capacity as some sort of dinosaur trainer; a process whereby the once-feared velociraptors are now essentially pets performing tricks at a click. Occupying him on his strand is Vincent D'Onfrio's shady Vic Hoskins, who wants the raptors signed over to the military to essentially fight Al-Qaeda, but we have previous experience of this archetype by way of Paul Riser's character in James Cameron's 'Aliens'.He is present in the park to help Claire with a new hybrid dinosaur the park has created: the Indominus-Rex, which is director Colin Trevorrow's taking of the franchise to bigger places: 'The Lost World' needed to put a Tyrannosaurus Rex in an urban environment; 'Jurassic Park 3' needed its Spinosaurus to juice up proceedings and now the 2015 vintage technically needs something that doesn't even exist to keep people interested. With a Tyrannosaurus-Rex in place of the lab-creation, but the film exactly as it otherwise is, things just wouldn't be as much fun. The trouble is, this new creation, echoing perhaps Frankenstien's Monster, is a bloodthirsty killer which does not take to being caged up, and it is not long before things get out of hand once it cuts loose. What follows is essentially a B-movie trussed up like an A-movie, an old adage which, I believe, was once attributed to Spielberg's 'Jaws' anyway, although not in a derogatory manner, as the kids strive to survive in the wilderness; the park tries to contain the Indominus and Vincent D'Onofrio refuses to take 'no' for an answer.Along the way, we get plenty of dino-on-human and dino-on-dino action, but Trevorrow has a trick up his sleeve and it is the development of the Dallas-Howard character, whom is transformed from cold and robotic bureaucrat barely able to recall her nephew's name to hard-bodied supporting heroine on the front-line saving their lives. A very physical epitome of this might be the moment she physically tears away some of her clothes beside a waterfall in order to shed one 'skin' and embrace another. Various 'body' theories have been coined about allowing the viewer to technically gauge just how far along the film has progressed by the state of a lead character's 'body' without so much as even glancing at a watch.Alas there is not much to marvel at away from the heavy spectacle of dinosaurs doing what dinosaurs used to do to one another, not to mention what they would almost certainly do to human-beings if in close proximity to them, aside from Dallas-Howard's aforementioned arc. Colin Trevorrow should strike us as a shrewd director, in that he manages to pay homage to the 1993 original in fairly audacious ways without ever really encroaching on it. Despite this, he manages to take what now appears to be a franchise that has been re-energised and reinvigorated to new and exciting places. The film is for sure a success, but is not innocent of lacking in several areas.",6,4,9,3 April 2016
World Trade Center," As the world watches on in awe and disbelief, certain men stuck under the debris of the World Trade Centre frighteningly form their own perspective of said day's events.
","World Trade Centre tells the terrifying true story of a handful of very specific kinds of policemen, namely Port Authority officers, caught up in the cataclysmic New York-based events of the eleventh of September in 2001. It is a rather harrowing retelling of certain events involving a group of men buried alive under an entire skyscraper that has fallen at the wayside, as their loved ones back home in the form of friends and family watch on in terror at the attacks unfolding on television, all the time looking on in sheer anxiety at how badly those they know are caught up in it. The piece is a somewhat gruelling two-hour plus experience about a pretty gruelling, rather harrowing scenario brought to life on the screen by American director Oliver Stone; the observing a fleeting chance at life several men have which is tense and involving. It's one of Stone's more toned down features, not overly aggressive nor confrontational despite finding room for political thematics, but most certainly warming and dramatic regardless.At the centre of it is the dry, husky and worn tone of Nicolas Cage portraying John McLoughlin, amply flanked by two others in the form of Jay Hernandez's Dominick Pezzulo and Michael Peña's Will Jimeno; the three of them trapped under a whole heap of rubble following the deliberate crashing of two jet airliners into the World Trade Centre in 2001. For these men, like everybody else, what appeared to be another usual day beginning at dawn turned into a nightmare scenario. Stone opens the film in a melancholic fashion, some sharp angles looking directly upwards at the sky and the tall buildings to some angelic music feeling like a fleeting, final glance at what once was. When we're on the road with McLoughlin, there are some glancing shots of police officers on duty with another wide shot capturing a busy highway leading into the city, in what is a broader emphasis on those of whom were more affected than others that day; specifically in emergency service personnel and commuters only. There is little in the way of character establishment up to this point and the camera keeps its distance from most figures on screen at these points, be they workers in their cars or officers on the beat, so as to get across a broader and more archetypal sense of who'll come to be affected. The feeling of all New Yorkers being linked together as one feels prominent.When the time comes for a bus load of the authorities to ship out to the scene of World Trade Plaza, McLoughlin is asked as to what's to be done but states that there 'is no plan' since such a situation has never previously been processed nor preordained. The feeling of disillusion and disorientation felt at the time in the lack of a plan as well as the magnitude of the task at hand in that they're going in blind is here effectively emphasised. A range of men occupy the bus as they all head in, that collective sense of everybody being involved and in the situation 'as one' as before effectively put across by way of the Hispanic; African-American and Caucasian Port Authority officers riding on into the danger zone capturing a broad scope linked to the fact everyone is in it together. Upon arrival, the actors are given the final task before heading in of gazing upwards at the proverbial burning towers and recalling whatever emotions or reactions conjured on the day when it happened; here being the point that any audience member whom was an outsider looking in that day, regardless of nationality or where one was, are now to be taken inside so as to experience the true tale of a group of men first hand at how it all unfolded from within.The interior lobby reveals innocents on the way out looking beaten and bloody, anxious to get away from the very location we're heading into. McLoughlin and his team look dirty; worn; scared and marked as it is, the venturing into the torrid unknown resonating with what prior knowledge we have of what'll transpire settling in and gearing us up for what will be a terrifying procession of events. Stone handles the men being trapped underground rather well, the characters exchanging information based on one another; rousing each other not to give up and to stay awake at all costs as they lay there in an elevator shaft having had dozens of storeys collapse on top of them. Back home, the wives of those involved in John's wife Donna (Bello) and their four children as well as Jimeno's in the form of Allison (Gyllenhaal) can only watch on via the television with bated breath as action is taken on what is now ground level.Michael Shannon's Dave Karnes appears to run his own operation in trying to save anybody still trapped. A religious ex-SEAL, Karnes decks himself out in army clothing and ventures out into the rubbled remains of World Trade Plaza with an angry attitude of wanting to get out there as soon as possible and react so as to sort everything out. Karnes is a character that might be read into as being representative of America's attitudes post-attack, the verbal establishment of America now being 'at war' with somebody with Karnes' attire and attitude to do what he does is political allegory disguised as acts of bravery. Stone captures a somewhat perfect overall tone to the film, respectful and knowledgeable of bravery without ever being too sentimental or mawkish. He doesn't overplay the achievement of what these men did at a fateful time; and certainly doesn't go down a route similar to that of John Sturges, whose adaptation of the men trapped at Stalag Luft III camp in The Great Escape was given a bright and breezy lift. Stone's film is smart and taut, an involving watch based on the stories of those at the forefront.",7,0,1,13 December 2010
Black Snake Moan," Sharp and entertaining with a total disregard to the rules, although it pulls it off for the best part.
","In Black Snake Moan, you have a film that covers so much ground that I don't think even it realises where it's gone and what it's done. The film goes through so many emotions and inflicts so much pain, regret and suspense on its characters that by the time it's entering its final act it doesn't know weather to keep on the straight and narrow screwball comedy road it wants to go down or if it wants to develop into a darker, more tragic film involving deaths of characters we've come to actually love but this is what makes Black Snake Moan the experience it is.The next man may be able to stand up and say that he or she has seen more films than I have but Black Snake Moan is, to me, a one of a kind film. It manages to integrate comedy, sometimes black, sometimes screwball and sometimes teen sex; horror; romance and tragedy. Even if Black Snake Moan never quite makes up its mind which of these its going to settle with, the content and chemistry the film has on screen with its audience works quite well. Rae (Ricci) is a girl who certainly doesn't break any boundaries in terms of how we look at women in films or how they are portrayed: she's sort of a cross between a femme fatale from a film noir; a dumb blonde from a teen sex comedy and a porn star from, well, a porn film.Rae may dress in nothing but a top too small for her and little white panties that get progressively dirtier but her character grows in leaps and bounds. I said that Black Snake Moan is a number of things and one thing it certainly includes that impressed me was its character development. Ronnie (Timberlake) is Rae's partner at the very beginning and gets sent off to 'a' war thus interrupting their romance. This is shown in tandem with Lazarus' (Jackson) scenario and how he's lost his love through that old down and outer divorce since his partner is no longer in love with him but seemingly with a long time friend of the two. Thus, the set up is complete and the audience are invited to 'side' with a character: which situation best fits you? Perhaps if you're male you identify with Lazarus, female means Rae is your girl. What's interesting is that under this smokescreen of genres and little outfits for Ricci to wear and get everyone all excited is a statement: Rae is lost after Ronnie leaves; she goes to parties and desperately tries to have fun, forget her troubles and attempts to perhaps fall in love again but she only finds more pain and anguish at her attempts to fit back into society again and regain a sex life. Lazarus' experience is more that of playing the blues and drinking whiskey; although reminiscent of a film noir, the mise-en-scene and music work well to tell us what he's feeling.Black Snake Moan also does the clever thing and leaves the setting ambiguous. The cars we see everyone drive around in a reminiscent to those massive American cars you get in the 1940s and 50s but it is a poor area of Deep South America after all. Rae wears outfits reminiscent of the 1960s and 70s at first with her teenybopper top displaying the confederate flag, making her look like a character out of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre but she later matures through what she wears: a dress. Where Ronnie goes off to to fight is also interesting. I said 'a' war earlier on; is it Gulf War II or the War on Terror? Or is it perhaps Vietnam? Nothing is really set in stone creating a timeless, 'could happen anywhere, anytime' atmosphere which was quite clever. From memory, I don't recall anyone using cell phones or computers but again, is this just due to the poor area the film is set?Black Snake Moan is a film that has fun with itself. It gets Christiana Ricci wearing next to nothing, it combines loads of genres, it has fun with its setting and resembles a screwball comedy at times what with Rae on the leash, standing in a seductive pose in the middle of a field  that twinned with the fact Lazarus has to chase her around the farm now and again to stop her escaping; all of it similar to the way Henry Fonda had to chase Barbara Stanwyck around that boat in 'The Lady Eve'. Black Snake Moan is a film that's fun but it's smart because it knows it's fun. It's also smart because it knows what it's doing and how it's going to deliver it: comedy in its portrayal of women; tragedy in its lost love narrative and horror in Rae's flashbacks. I could recommend Black Snake Moan as a comedy, as a love story or as a film in which people are just trying to find out who they are; on those notes, it's good enough to be a success in my opinion.",6,4,9,3 November 2007
The Hangover Part II," Bangkok's Dangerous for our Vegas 'wolfpack', as the same film is churned out again - louder; nastier and abroad.
","It must surely be the case that 'The Hangover 2' is the moment people come to realise their folly in liking the first film, and thus come to review their opinions on it. Indeed, how can one realistically claim to enjoy the initial 2009 effort, about the hijinks of three American men lost and confused in the city of Las Vegas, without proclaiming the superiority of this one too? It may, of course, be the case that you claim to like both, but this is surely mere self-delusion as this second effort is patently not good - it is about as ordinary as the first one, no better or worse - a series of chaotic sequences involving connected men in an alien locale which doesn't happen to have the raw punch of the first because neither the jokes nor the scenarios are fresh.
Within the first hour, one can practically hear the voices of the producers and writers which radiated out of the well-groomed office suites of a large Los Angeles building bathed in 27 degrees of sunshine - people knocking around ideas for the sequel to the wildly successful and perhaps genuinely funny in two or three places comedy 'The Hangover'. Let's not mince our words: the second film exists because of the financial success of the first, nothing else. 
The film is, more or less, a rehash of the initial outing: the location has changed to Thailand, offering the dynamic of a language barrier for our leads to struggle through, and another character has joined the troupe in the form of the young; Asian and gifted Teddy (Mason Lee), but the formula is not one that has been strayed from especially greatly.
As was the case with the first film, I did not believe for one second that the parties involved would know one another; care for one another or have anything to do with one another in the real world: Phil (Bradley Cooper), a primary school teacher who steals his pupils' money in the first film, here attempts to swipe a prescription sheet for some narcotics which will take you to a happy place whilst at the dentist. Ha ha. Said dentist is Stuart (Ed Helms), who is the series' lateral thinker and musician. Completing the foursome is Doug (Justin Bartha), whom I spent most of the first film wondering how he would know these people, and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) - Doug's somewhat retarded in-law. 
It is Stuart's wedding in Thailand that propels the gang off and away for their latest escapade, one which will eventually see them (minus Doug, whose presence in the franchise may now very well be redundant) charge around the noisy, squalid streets of Bangkok and its surrounding suburbs looking for soon-to-be brother in law Teddy. Todd Phillips and his creative crew tweak the 'winning' formula only very slightly, this time forcing the crew into their misadventure after they each agree to have a quiet drink on the beach rather than a boisterous night out. Things do not go entirely to plan, and someone from the original gang of course is missing when the time comes to wake up in a mysterious hotel room: Stuart does not lose a tooth, but instead obtains a tattoo; there is no tiger in the suite, but instead they have acquired a monkey; the groom is fine, but his father-in-law's pride and joy has disappeared without a trace... 
This propels Stuart; Alan and Phil into action, but the writing is generally lazy: Thai stereotypes, such as the monastery dwelling Buddhist monk on a vow of silence and the ladyboy whore, pepper the experience, while the film has to resort to using a monkey to boost its chuckle count. Monkeys are funny, aren't they?.
If the writing is lazy, the adventure itself is mostly unspectacular: whether it was the regurgitation of old jokes or something else, very little of 'The Hangover 2' is actually that funny, but then it struck me that perhaps it isn't supposed to be.... There is a strange air to the film, almost as if the predicament this time round is something to endure rather than have fun experiencing. The gang's hammering around Las Vegas and the surrounding Nevada desert carried with it a fun, punchy feeling - it was a process they sensed they'd survive, if only they could piece together the clues.... In Bangkok, the 'wolfpack' have strayed too far from home and the film plays more like an odd action/horror hybrid as the gang bear seedy backstreets; psychotic Russian cartels and friends' severed fingers...
Where Doug's fiancée was afforded the opportunity to spit fire at the crew's losing the love of her life in the 2009 effort, tremendous strain is undertaken to prevent Teddy's father from ever knowing that they placed this clean-cut young man in the way of any kind of harm. Despite not necessarily having anything 'wrong' with him, it had already been established that Stuart is disliked profusely by his future father in-law - the vanishing of Teddy under his watch risks enraging him even further, potentially scuppering the wedding entirely. But without Teddy's father ever discovering he was first lost, and then retrieved, nothing is learnt and the entire arc of his coming to accept Stuart as an in-law himself is rendered totally redundant.'The Hangover', not to mention this sequel, are films which most people seem to really enjoy - I think most critics seemed to realise they were had the first time round when the time came to see this second film, hence the backlash which seems to have been born out of their own frustration with themselves for not getting the review right first time round. I'd like to be able to enjoy it all with everybody else, but I just find myself unable to get involved with any of it. You could do a lot worse than this and its slightly older brother, but you could probably do better.",5,0,0,23 December 2017
The Insider," Captivating; enrapturing and enthralling legal thriller, with which the superlatives just about run out as some terrifying dramatisations take centre stage.
","Michael Mann's The Insider is perhaps one of the most accomplished thrillers I've ever seen, a nigh on two and a half hour battle through turmoil; plight; anguish and terror so as to show up those evil enough to do what they do. The film, one of the very best of not only its respective year but the decade of the 1990s, is a thrilling; alarming and intuitive legal thriller based mostly on fact about the proverbial little guy suffering from fraught attacks of the conscience where those in the past have blazed through unabashed before eventually going on a campaign with the view to triumph over megalomania. In all of its runtime, there is barely a dull nor uninteresting moment; Mann effectively going on to tell two tales of hard-edged and immense confrontation that is never anything less that wholly fascinating as it juggles character with narrative with a real sense of filmmaking.One of the two chief protagonists is Al Pacino's Lowell Bergman, a journalist more specifically tied to a television news production named '60 minutes'; our first sight of this man highlighting his unwavering ability to deal with what seems a rather hair raising situation when he occupies a small room, blindfolded, and manages to swing an interview with a stiff and uneasily moved Lebanon based Sheikh. Once a worker for a publication entitled 'Ramparts Magazine', the inferring that he has come a long way in his chosen field feels prominent. As things unfold, he'll go on to become more deeply involved in the affairs of Russell Crowe's Jeffrey Wigand; a recently fired tobacco company executive whom drives home to distorted editing and cold blue hues as the reaction to being let go settles on his mind. The few fleeting moments we see of the man at his office has him observe the staff party going on next door as he packs away his things alone, the sense of him being an outsider; disconnected or disenchanted with those of whom he works prominent - nobody is seeing him off, and this disconnection or alienation to his workplace or company comes to feature prominently later on. His wife is Liane (Venora), one of his two young daughters is Barbara (Eisenberg) whom suffers from asthma.Their coming together is through a series of crude and unspecific faxes they send to each another, Bergman's receiving of numerous tobacco company documents sees him contact Wignard for specificities on the subject. One thing leads to another and his ex-tobacco company, representative of Michal Gambon's cold and methodical in tone but large and imposing and authoritative in figure, megalomaniac calls him in to reach some sort of confidentiality deal. Crowe's character is seated in-front of his former boss as another employee looms anonymously as well as ominously behind Crowe whilst cut off at the shoulders; the deal he's called in for breaking down and causing all manner of antagonism and conflict. The resulting threats cause them to revoke his medical related compensation after being fired, meaning they are effectively targeting doing young Barbara harm and are therefore even more efficient as the villains of the piece.Mann's film is a documenting of the plump, bleary-eyed and somewhat weedy looking Wignard going up against this company with the keen and effectual Bergman. On most of the occasions Crowe's character occupies the screen, he's shot in an unflattering manner; his ambling and stumbling frame not particularly complimenting his overall build and going hand-in-hand with the relatively concurrent close ups of his facial features that dominate the frame: his expression rendered desperate and this working particularly well during the instances in which Wignard is on the telephone so as to capture this grossly unflattering look. The interplay is illuminating, the observing of this man in Wignard just having his life crumble in-front of him born out of the threats his ex-company implant onto him and the paranoia he carries that Bergman is merely in it for himself as a journalistic coup is morbidly fascinating.Mann balances each of the respective plights ingeniously; where he has his audience sympathise with Crowe, he has them associate themselves with Pacino as this outsider to both the story and the finer details of the case. Where it's established the tobacco company are evil, sinful, grotesquely amoral, loathsome and downright putrid in their actions anyway, Mann has them simultaneously deny nicotine as a suspiciously addictive material as well as demean the war dead when a small but revealing little moment sees Wignard's vehicle pause beside a Second World War memorial graveyard as Wignard sits in the foreground while the man travels to speak openly about things his ex-employers would prefer aren't revealed: the exercising of one's freedom of speech over which those in the graveyard we have resonating in the background essentially died for, and the same freedom of speech the imperialist mega-corporation essentially wish to suppress or take away, feeling prominent. Mann's The Insider is a quite brilliant dramatisation of some eerily true-to-life events, one of the best legal thrillers of recent times and a powerhouse of the filmmaking hallmarks in editing; direction; acting and cinematography combining to form something quite special.",9,2,2,9 February 2011
The Dark Knight," Bold without ever being especially great, and which progressively gets less-interesting; the film is a wild concoction of ideas that just about treads water.
","Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of 'soon-to-be-Batman' Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: 'you're not The Devil, you're practise' he hisses. The feeling's that 2008's The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one's very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist 'acts' in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate 'post' imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker's videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who's under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman's police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham's 'white knight', suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman's 'dark' but is just different in technique and characteristics.Joker's parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham's gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in 'sonar vision' which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody's linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down.",6,191,463,25 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Watchable little sports film that encompasses many-a positive characteristic and comes as pretty essential viewing to anyone under the age of about eighteen.
","You hold your breath going into The Greatest Game Ever Played, a Disney-produced piece that documents a lowly ranked American underdog going into a 'home' tournament against the best in the world, who are British, in order to defeat them at their own game. Biggest of biggest surprises then, when you realise it isn't really about that at all and instead we find it encompassing a number of very positive, very re-assuring traits linked to self-esteem; individualism and the class system, even if it borrows from out-and-out clichÃ© on other occasions. It's a pretty routine three out of five stars sports picture that handles everything it wants to in a commendable manner; but as a piece aimed at a specific, more younger audience, the film creeps up into the realm of three and a half to four out of five. This is for its energy, vibrancy and brass-tacks look at young people trying to figure out where they belong in the world; what they want to do and that no matter how famous or skilled you are or might see someone as, everybody can hurt.The scene that documents this best is the instance in which golfer Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) is about to take a tee-shot during a tournament, but is suddenly and slightly overcome with fear born out of what happened to him as a boy, as four ominous top-hat clad men loom over him. He acknowledges it, swings and hits a decent shot. It is he whom we begin with in The Greatest Game Ever Played; as his cold, dark and drab Jersey-set place of dwelling is ruthlessly torn down by those wanting to expand, update and modernise his patch of land for sake of a links golf course. 'What's golf?' asks a young Harry; he gets a reply from one of the aggressors that resembles something in the region of 'a game people like you will never get to play'. Golf is Harry's Achilles heel; his ultimate love/hate item. It is the reason he has the demons he does, but it is the reason everyone knows of him through his fame. The scene additionally introduces us to the study of class the film carries throughout; the notion that it doesn't matter who you are or where you're from; if you want to try something supposedly out of your league, then go for it.Cut to the not so far future and we have the welcoming, colourful, activity-laden America, plus a credits sequence. But below the supposed glitz and appeal of the good old U.S. lies an equally troubled young man in the form of Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), a young adult living in rather a large family in conditions that, I suppose for the time, are just about good enough to see them get by. As the next in line to adopt that old fashioned, and somewhat annoying, 'man of the house' tag; it's thought the logical thing for Francis to do is get a traditional, steady job as his father did in order to earn the money for the keep. But Francis dares to dream, and in Francis many of the film's target audience will see themselves as this young individual on the verge of life. Francis embodies everything you'd want in a lead: he's young, energetic, handsome, ambitious, kind and has the aforementioned Harry Vardon as an idol. Francis opts to go against the status quo and, unsurprisingly, wants to take up golf.Bill Paxton has done the unthinkable, but in an extremely positive sense. He's made a really accessible film using golf as the backdrop for the Disney crowd - a film that studies angst and the career-related decisions of young adulthood, whilst seamlessly incorporating the element of one's 'class'. The film's structure might remind you of 2006's Goal, a similar film in tone and study that came out around about the same time, about this young man daring to dream and having to go through his oppositional opinionated father in the process. Francis' father, Arthur (Elias Koteas), maintains his chief gripe, which is that golf's for 'gentlemen'; the sort that sneer and totally disregard those of the level Arthur sees himself and his family at. Francis ignores the advice, goes ahead and plays golf but his father's concern and disciplined advice turns into confusion and rage when he realises that as an amateur, Francis doesn't even get paid for it.Like 2006's football orientated film Goal, the lead gets an early shot and doesn't quite swipe the opportunity; but he rises from where he subsequently finds himself. As events take their turn, Ouimet is allowed a wild-card entry, as an amateur, into the 1913 U.S. Open; one of only two golfing majors that existed at that time. He is accompanied by his idol Varden; as well as the equally skilled and equally real Ted Ray; a big, booming Englishman who we're introduced to as a boozing, brawling, tavern-frequenting man whom manages to retain his golfing skills despite all this. In there as well is the nationalistic and egotistical true-to-life American golfer John McDermott, who doesn't care who wins as long as an American beats these Brits here, in America, at their own game. McDermott represents everything I feared going into the film, his inclusion is one of a very knowing addition on Paxton's behalf; and his demise from the tournament teaches us of what qualities you need-not possess. In a contemporary climate full of celebrities and the obsessives that follow them, how nice to see a film that's about a young character drawn to someone of great stature by way of his hard work, but a role model whom they themselves carry particular demons. The film is a real winner: tense and entertaining whilst consistently engrossing.",6,0,1,15 September 2009
Annie Hall," Focussed and funny, Allen's 'Hall' is a winner.
","Thank heavens I know about enough of people like William Buckley and Marshall McLuhan in order to enjoy 'Annie Hall'; thank goodness I know who Federico Fellini is in order to laugh at one of its jokes whereby his name is mentioned. 'Annie Hall' is like that - it's in and out with a joke or a reference or a line of dialogue and, before you've even been granted the time to absorb it; digest it; appreciate it, it's flown on to the next one. It plays, in fact, a little bit like a stand-up comedy routine - it has a certain flowing evanescence to it, an absorbing self-confidence. It isn't flippant or chaotic - moreover, it is a film under almost the complete control of those who have made it; its poise refreshing and its influence on its genre coming to it now quite evident.'Annie Hall' is, in essence, a somewhat conventional love story told in an unconventional, even peculiar, manner. It breaks the fourth wall; hops around two different equilibriums; plucks famous people out from behind house plants and speaks to them; interviews people in the street; uproots the action from one end of the United States to the other halfway through and, perhaps most jarringly, departs for an animated sequence involving the film's protagonist and an old Disney villain. And yet, at its heart, is a relatively simple exploration of love; relationships and what it means to really feel something for someone else.Alvy, played by the film's director and writer Woody Allen, is a stand-up comedian living in New York with a kind of C-list celebrity status whose life is characterised by his comedic routines; games of tennis with his best friend Rob (Tony Roberts) and a persecution complex that all Gentiles secretly hate him (he mishears when someone asks him 'Did you...?' and 'Did Jew...?') He has already been married twice.His story is one about a relationship with the eponymous Annie, played by Diane Keaton, who, just to complicate a film already dripping in postmodernism, happened to be Allen's partner at the time of the shoot; whose surname was originally Hall and whose real-life nickname was, indeed, 'Annie'. It cannot be a coincidence that, when they are first introduced to one another at a tennis club, they quite literally undertake this process of facing off over the net with one another, going head-to-head in what is a sport characterised by back-and-forths. Later, when they head back to hers for a drink and she serves wine, one of them must consume theirs out of a half-pint glass due to a lack of proper wine-glasses. It's a small detail but it cleverly infers Annie is not used to hosting.The pleasure, in fact, from watching the film derives from the fact the subject matter is handled with a surprising amount of maturity, which clashes with the approach but never sees one overwhelm the other. It also derives from the fact the film, exemplified in the above, is made like a proper film: the camera is an active participant in the action and the message; the edits are rarely invisible; the approaches it takes to shooting specific scenes appear carefully chosen for specific reasons.Take, for instance, the scene fairly early on, though deep into Alvy and Annie's tryst, whereby, in the dead of night, they lie in bed and talk over one another, unsure if they want to make love, and are shot from a perspective which is so far away, we are able to see the entire room and all its clutter. Eventually, a siren roars past outside and they call the whole thing off. The language of the scene infers degrees of chaos and mess in their relationship, a sharp contrast to an earlier scene under exactly the same circumstances when they are shot from a tighter angle, reflecting closeness, and in tones more synonymous with scenes of romance - low lighting and soft shadow.But the film is more than a mere love story, the likes of which we may have seen a hundred times. It philosophises on relationships; concluding that while some are just doomed, irrespective of what is tried, you need them in the first place in order to move on to life's next stage. Alvy, for instance, encourages Annie to study an adult course in something, but this only pushes her closer to a lecturer. When he tells her to take her singing more seriously, this just pushes her into the eyes of a record producer, thus dooming the relationship. And yet, what would Annie really be if she'd never even met Alvy?
Dorling Kindersley's 'Movie Book' of 2014 concludes that the film is, at its heart, an exploration of what makes a relationship successful, even resorting to asking people in a New York street what they think. But, the review concludes bleakly, there is no real answer: one couple remark that they're happy because they're shallow and don't have 'anything interesting to say' to one another. Compared to modern comedies about sex or relations or a combination of the two, this stands head and shoulders above most in the genre and is unsurprisingly looked upon as the springboard for Allen's fame.",7,0,0,7 March 2020
Green Street Hooligans," Solid documentation of an outsider drifting towards aggression and masculinity, as a grotesque life in a football firm takes over.
","The comparisons to Nick Love's 2004 film The Football Factory are almost obligatory when talking of Green Street, but they are linked only by way of subject matter. The films are wildly different in their approaches and attitudes to football firm violence and gang life. Green Street tells the tale of an absolute outsider making his way into a football firm and gradually infiltrating the group as the ever volatile life of fighting and maiming takes a hold on them, seducing them into a stupor of all things crude and nasty. On the other hand, The Football Factory tells the story of a young man of about equal age to Green Street's lead, but instead documents a very gradual decline; focusing more on the way this lifestyle drags down his conscience and mental well-being as the match-day punch-ups take their toll. In short, I find The Football Factory to be one of the most frightening; most affecting and one of the more interesting British films of the last ten or so years whereas Green Street is a passable tale of a young man caught up in a reprehensible lifestyle and how this affects him for his longer run at life.Green Street is more the processed film, in the sense it requires time to set up a lead and his 'current' lifestyle; introduce the characters they'll be spending the majority of their time with; have them enter this 'new' lifestyle; gradually build them up within that bubble before having it all implode and have everything linked to the demonisation of hooliganism play out – it is the quintessential Amercican fable of rising through the ranks. The Football Factory carried less of a preordained aura, it was a series of quite frightening scenes; situations; interactions and instances in which the lead, played by Danny Dyer, would very gradually reach a level of realisation, most of the time shrugging off these warning signs but unable to shake the question at the very core of that film: 'Was it worth it?'. Indeed, the intended audience is so far infused with Elijah Wood's lead here that football firms and hooliganism in general needs to be explained to him, in black and white, by someone more experienced with the lifestyle.Green Street's Americanised sensibility is captured in its narrative structure; its more thorough attention to character arc and its somewhat flashy, glitzy aesthetic that it carries throughout, acting rather uncomplimentary with its disgusting subject matter. One is reminded of Alan Clarke's low-budgeted; grimy; scuzzy-looking 1988 effort The Firm which was, granted, made for television but gave the world in which it was set a downtrodden and frightening feel to it through its colour saturation and persistence on having the scenes play out in enclosed terrace streets complete with rock solid brick walls acting as the backdrop plus worn-out public houses in which large groups of men would be shot in close-up format instilling confrontation and claustrophobia.It's said that German born female director Lexi Alexander is to have based the film on a number of real life instances with people of a similar ilk, but most of her characters are given some pretty unreal 'triggers' or prior tragedies to further both character and conflict; some of the characters having undergone specific transitions that render them specific archetypes that exist to aid the progression of the story. Examples include the psychotic firm leader whose son died many years ago as a result of some large scale fighting and the once feared 'general' whose lifestyle changed after he met a nice American woman and settled down. The use of these specific lifestyles and prior tragedies to emote both threat and the sense that something's at stake forces the film to feel a little fabricated, thus, pushing the film away a downtrodden sense that something like The Firm certainly had and The Football Factory effectively carried.Indeed, it is Elijah Wood that plays American Matt Buckner, a guy who was expelled from Harvard university in America when his room-mate was busted for cocaine and he took the fall for it. After this, he consequently arrives in England, during which he meets all sorts of new and interesting people. Buckner's past low-point is established, as is the fact he is pushed around a little too easily in the drug charge and the early scuffle he has with friend and mentor to-be Pete Dunham (Hunnam), one item of which highlights how far he'll come in developing during his time in England with the other of which acting as the 'wrong' which exists to be 'righted'. Alexander captures the bond these men have, these big; well muscled men clutching a hold of each other as they sing and talk dirty in pubs, indeed Matt and Pete's relationship is taken to a point that sees a rival, Pete's former best friend, enter a public house as they share a drink and storm out again in a jealous rage when Matt and Pete's bonding is captured by way of his gaze.I don't think the film enjoys the violence, nor does it invite us to enjoy it; more-so, it is the lead character that enjoys the rush of the violence while the scenes play out around him and this acceptance into a sub-culture occurs. Throughout, we know better than Wood's character; highlighted when Matt's father arrives in town and tells his son they can fight this drug charge together – but Matt isn't interested, and would rather stay in a reprehensible zone than continue a righteous life in higher education. The film's worth seeing; its supported by a number of decent performances, predominantly from Bell and Dunham while Wood does his usual 'caught in the headlights' act. Whilst more forced and fabricated than earlier hooligan studies, Green Street is a decent enough film that documents downfall of some degree and the eventual results of how violence and conflict is seen as something to look forward to.",6,2,2,15 February 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," The filmic equivalent of a masterpiece painting.
","Although I'm not a big fan of the sci-fi genre overall, I'm well aware of Stanley Kubrick and remain a big fan of his films. As it was with '2001: A Space Odyssey', the film completely blew me away.With some very haunting music throughout and some superb use of classical tunes; 2001: A Space Odyssey gets its experience across via visuals twinned with melodies rather than all out, fast, choppy action which entertains on a different level. With lengthily takes, long compositions and drawn out activity; the film had quite an effect on me as I sat there in rather a bemused awe that a film like this actually existed, let alone managed to hide from me for all those years, let alone actually be produced in 1968. Its sheer unpredictability and grace makes it, like most other Kubrick films, something you have to settle down to watch properly rather than put on any old film.The fact no human is actually present for the first twenty or so minutes and the opening consists solely of apes at the dawn of mankind is fascinating in itself and although there are complaints of it being too long and that the only real important thing we get out of this start is the fact the monolith makes it presence known as evolution happens, it's built up in a way that we can start to relate to the apes; see what they're going through and ultimately, get a feeling for the long timeframe that's going on as evolution takes place only every million years or whatever so this long, slow opening does serve a purpose: to create the feeling time is going past.Once human characters are thrown into the fray (via that famous cut you've no doubt heard of) certain conventions of psychological horror/drama are present in characters building up another place through eerie rumours and negative opinions through dialogue. This occurs when the doctors around the tables are badmouthing the place where the monolith has mysteriously appeared; somewhere the guy we've just spent the last ten minutes solely with is going; and it's truly unnerving. This is also a great chance to blend in some future things through humour and whatever else. These things include the fact Pan-Am now make space rockets to the fact the gravity toilet instructions run all the way down the side of the wall as it's so complicated to use and yet, is merely a toilet. Great stuff.When the next 'stage' of the film occurs after the mysterious monolith wins round two on mankind; the, arguably, most well known segment of the film kicks in: the exchanges on board the space ship containing the HAL 9000 computer. This is probably my favourite part too but only because the dialogue, exchanges, tension and brain bending camera work all work together as one. The chess game early on in the segment which is so easily missed amongst the rest of the beauty is an early indication and warning that the HAL 9000 isn't as tame as you'd think and beats the human crew member rather easily, obnoxiously asking the pitiful human if he resigns the game to which the crew member submits. During the rest of this segment, bizarre things like seeing the ship from the computer's point of view, watching it attempt to lip read the crew through sound proof glass and the title 'intermission' coming up during this is really something to behold, thus, it makes something like a simple close up shot of a red light staring right back at you something that has never been so eerie in a film before.The final piece in this puzzle occurs at a location that I won't spoil but after all this space and spaceship setting, suddenly appearing in this new location is very disorientating and, again, takes you aback since you just can't predict it. What do all the colours and shapes mean that flair up just before this and why are still images of the surviving space team member flashing up at random intervals? I feel this is the monolith sucking in the character into another dimension, possibly into itself, where it nurtures and grows the character so old, that it has to re-birth it. Stunning stuff.With ambiguity, humour, colour, randomness, fantastic use of music and very eerie suspense; 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably one of the greatest films of its genre and rightfully deserves its praise.",10,1,3,12 January 2007
Toy Story," The sort of film that, when looking back over Dinsey's animation triumphs of decades ago, very much holds a case for a position in said canon.
","Amongst a lot of other things, 1995's Toy Story is a mixing of basic filmic conventions in the form of character arcs and genre demands blended with highly effective comedic content, all combined with a high concept into a piece thoroughly enjoyable and worthwhile. Its energy unmistakable; its inspiration unequalled and its charm unmatched, in what is a milestone in animation for reasons much more than the fact the computer generated imagery was as fresh as it was. Vaugely, the memory of seeing it for the first time many years ago stands in rather stark comparison to whatever I recall of the rest of that viewing when it was revealed Toy Story was to be, quite literally, about the toys and their coming to life so as to interact and engage with their surroundings. In starting in the manner it does, with a young boy named Andy animating his toys to as to bring them to life and interact with what's around them as it ran on whatever meek story he could come up with and not knowing a thing about the premise or indeed content, ignorantly, I led myself into believing the entire piece would be of this ilk; quite literally, a toy story about toys being what they are: inanimate objects being interacted with by a child. Imagine the sense of surprise mixed with awe and glee when Woody sits up in Andy's room and announces that 'the coast is clear!' to the rest of the toys.The film starts like one of those short cartoons you'd see before the beginning of a feature film, years ago. The opening is a diverting mini-narrative involving each of the main characters going through whatever motions a child can muster; the lead toy of whom is Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll which is promptly taken downstairs and around the house as it's emphasised he is Andy's favourite, and has been for a while. I suppose what happens when they come alive might be read into as a deconstruction of these toys; that they are, indeed, so much more than just inanimate objects whom don't think nor feel, each of them coming alive once the humans have vacated then operating within said space; maintaining relationships and feeling an array of emotions such as fear, angst and lust. Some are friendlier than others; some more confident and some have certain elevated relationships with each other. Amongst them, Don Rickles' Potato Head doll; a wonderful creation of physical comedy whose detachable body parts are the source of persistently funny jokes. He's joined by a Slinky Dog (Varney); a green plastic dinosaur Rex (Shawn) and, curiously, Andy's piggy bank Hamm (Ratzenberger).Interestingly, Andy's toys seem infused by true-to-life western iconographic imagery, or are indeed representative of 'type' in their attitudes. Rex is a dinosaur, thus feels the need to be able to scare people with his 'roar' for reasons that must be linked to the fact T-Rex dinosaurs from billions of years ago did exactly this. Somehow, Rex is aware of this. Likewise Andy's small toy soldiers, led by a sergeant voiced by R. Lee Ermey, are as militarian as you'd expect but is there a written rule that says they must show expertise in special ops and must behave in the military manner they do? Remember those grey plastic soldiers of similar size you could get? I guess they'd be equally militarily efficient but could speak in a German accent. I had some yellow soldiers of similar size once; God only knows how they'd sound. There can be no surprise that the toys of Syd (von Detten) cannot speak, due to their forced hybridising with other toys under said child's tortuous regime which sees heads and bodies swapped with other toys thus falsifying their image.It can be no coincidence the two principal toy characters of the film are the two that most resemble human beings in their appearance, with Andy's other toys marginalised due to their animistic or unnatural characteristics. Woody's perfect existence is thrown into disarray by Buzz Lightyear (Allen), a spaceman toy Andy gets on his birthday; the revealing of the gift at the end of the present opening session starting this huge build up as to what Buzz is. Buzz's presence is an example of an item of a more futuristic; more science-fiction orientated nature coming into the house and taking over as older items are rendered more obsolete and therefore replaced thus rendering the issue one of a modernity driven nature, and is an item Toy Story 2 explored much more broadly in terms of genre replacing genre when toys of Woody's ilk are rendered nothing but mere museum pieces. But it is additionally representative of America's obsession with consumerism, in that I've no doubt Buzz is a part of a kind of franchise and Andy's gradual replacing of Woody posters/merchandise etc. This, as he and his mother occupy this blissfully suburban infused street which is systematic of the nation's own attitudes towards mass produced products.Woody and Buzz's overall ultimatum is issued to us, out loud, by Woody when they are stranded at a petrol station: Andy's due to move house shortly and both need to get home, so a lot is at stake and tension runs persistently high. Buzz's own tale of realisation is effortlessly inter-cut with this plight, along the way learning of a new existence and garnering a new lease of life as their relationship feeds off a rather Hollywoodised 'buddy' combination no doubt inspired by American films of the 1980s through to the early 1990s of this ilk. Apart from pioneering your now token 'chase' finale, of which encompasses all the elements and is seen nearer the end of mostly every CG animated film made since (see 2002's Monsters Inc. or 2009's Up), Toy Story is a wonderfully made, supremely nourishing film that opens our eyes to a whole new world within our own and enthrals and entertains in equal measure.",8,0,0,16 July 2010
Blood Diamond," Much like the diamond, this film is a jewel.
","Blood Diamond plays out like a number of things. Its use of a Macguffin to forward the plot is easy to spot but it makes full use of its approach and at times, the film will feel like a war film in the vein of Black Hawk Down minus the American soldiers; a secret agent film in the vein of a 'Bourne' film with DiCaprio replacing Damon and a political thriller surrounding a desperate situation in another country which isn't developed enough to deal with it itself.What felt fresh about Blood Diamond is its use of the diamond as the object and the country of Sierra Leone as the setting. I doubt if the film would've been as good had the diamond been a case of money being sought after in a city and it reminded me distinctly of a novel I read a couple of years ago entitled 'Night of the Fox' which was a Second World War story about an Allied general who gets washed up in France following a boat attack and is carrying extensive knowledge about the D-Day landings planned for France within the next month or so. Needless to say, certain Axis powers and characters all try and get their hands on it as it could prove vital for the Nazi effort. Blood Diamond was this sort of unpredictable, middle of a dystopia film with several powers all trying to find what's what.I especially liked the character study Blood Diamond had and its attention to development and detail as events unfolded. DiCaprio plays his character, Danny Archer, like a secret agent throughout most of the opening third but then as we get to know him more and more, it becomes clear why he's acting in that way and why he's so good at evading capture and dodging bullets. This is contrasted to the character of Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) whose story is so much more compelling and involving; where Archer's side of the film plays out like a Bourne film, Vandy's is more of an Apocalypto. But these two different approached are separated once the coming together of the two characters happens. They are combined in an effort where the film retains its 'Bourne' and 'Apocalypto' feel yet goes down the road of 'D-Day plans in France' or 'Bag of money in a city' obviously using a huge diamond buried somewhere in a war torn country full of jungle, warlords and greedy South African commandos.Blood Diamond becomes more action packed when the two leads combine. There is a fabulous scene in a street where after literally just meeting, Archer and Vandy are caught in a crossfire between two sides that escalates into a spontaneous war zone; echoing Black Hawk Down but also a Bourne film. There are also other scenes such as the escape of an ambush and a chase involving a jeep  the following exchange at a checkpoint guarded by kids with AK-47s is equally as compelling. But the whole time, Archer and Vandy sort of remain enemies as they're both after different things  Vandy wants the diamond and his family whereas Archer, deep down, just wants the diamond.Blood Diamond is not only a fast paced, adrenaline fuelled action film with excellent dialogue, acting and character development but also as a political comment on not only Sierra Leone's situation but Africa's as a whole. One character states how she says CNN will probably squeeze a report of Africa's troubles in-between the sports news and the weather forecast and there is further evidence of richer countries ignoring the situation when a bar television has Clinton addressing problems on his supposed affair and not problems on Sierra Leone's civil war. This is of course dealt with toward the very end when gracious acknowledgement is given to certain characters and I'll say that simple shots of Jewelry shop fronts have never been more meaningful. Blood Diamond is powerful and important as well as remaining entertaining and compelling.",8,0,1,24 September 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Joe Wright brings his visual style to a very old piece of text but that cannot save the film form being slightly humdrum.
","Here we go then, another Pride & Prejudice adaptation; a novel that's been around the block so many times even the popular Indian cinema film-makers amongst the British film industry have put their own spin on things, that little episode being 'Bride' & Prejudice. That particular film came out a mere year before Joe Wright's period romp debut and this take on things from Jane Austen's novel was obviously deemed by its director a pretty good place to start off, coming from a man who'd made some shorts and done some television work but here he gets to play amidst the big fish by taking a relatively large and well-known cast; a lot of money and is let loose amongst some top quality locales. It's a shame that the result is all very here and there.I think Wright identified that the best approach, at least in his mind, for a debut is to take on someone else's subject matter or text and bring it to life in the way you deem worthy. It's a safe choice and to be fair, Wright brings the text to life with a string of attractive camera angles and shots, drifting into vast Georgian England rooms that see the mise-en-scene on most occasions just drip off the screen; wowing us with locations and sets that ooze of the authentic. But it was all an appetiser for Wright's following film Atonement, which is actually about something and actually contains a pinch of emotion complete with a connection to the characters. If whenever someone comes up to you and states Pride & Prejudice is better than Atonement, swiftly correct them.So what is this film? It's an updating of a decades old tale for the 21st Century; whether that's a good thing or not is still up for debate. The Bennett sisters Jane (Pike); Elizabeth (Knightley); Mary (Riley); Catherine (Mulligan) and Lydia (Malone) are growing up much to the delight of their unnamed mother played by Brenda Blethyn and their father who's played by a slightly miscast Donald Sutherland  his job is to pop up every now and again and offer advice to his daughters in a sort of Jiminy Cricket role. Despite all these characters and this big overall family, it's only Elizabeth that is given much of the attention and it's only her we're really interested in.What I don't like is the initial sense that these five girls are 'up for grabs'. Some girls rush into relationships and some get burnt in the process, disappearing and becoming confused whereas Elizabeth is more conservative and adopts a more mature stance in the sense she wishes to wait a while longer for that 'true' love sensation. The overall theme to do with coming of age and that mistake you might make with first impressions is clear: Elizabeth initially dislikes a certain Mr. Darcy (Macfadyen) but along the way, she will learn and mature and what have you before realising that certain things are not what they first appear.I'd be lying if I said you don't let off the odd yawn during Pride & Prejudice. It's a tale about women; about love from the perspective of women with perspective being the key word in that sentence and I guess the easy thing to say would be that I'm not of the correct audience it's aimed at. Wright's second and most recent film, Atonement, was about a certain female perspective and it too had permutation's to do with love or lust. It was a distorted and immature perspective, one that was too young to figure out what was going on and I had no trouble with that film at all.But when is all said and done, that cannot hide the film's ho-hum approach to its narrative. There are the early exchanges; the glances; the gazes and the touching of the said person as one helps the other to mount a horse upon leaving the manor house. What keeps the film afloat for most of its time is its direction, the highlight of which in a visual sense is an unbroken take as the camera waltzes through a gathering of people, switching from ground level to head height as the camera adsorbs the costume and the setting it is so lushly presenting to us, proud and prestigious indeed.Another thing I noticed is that the film avoids, or at least did it sparsely enough for me not to notice, rendering one or any of its characters objects of the gaze. This is a theory built around the construction that certain characters or 'types' of characters are shot provocatively with the camera in order to subliminally force the audience into assuming them to be attractive. From what I saw, Pride & Predujice avoids doing this and for that I commend it, something very few films in the genre that would revolve around women, love, wanting to love and relationships would be successful in doing.Towards the end and once Elizabeth has started to come to her senses, the film does run out of juice somewhat. Wright grows tired of the inventive camera angels and showing off the fancy mise-en-scene and the film needs Judi Dench's character to re-raise a little bit of interest as the climax nears, some welcome antagonism in the form of an old battle-axe role that Dench basks in. Whether the dramas of love and relationships are actually captured here and that it's just a fancy, period drama vehicle with flashy visuals and camera work remains debatable but you have to commend the film on what it does do well.",6,1,4,15 January 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An absolute head-trip - for the viewer as well as the protagonist.
","Bizarre, alternative, tragic, beautiful; the list of adjectives could go on forever when it comes to describing the look and feel of Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind. The film is definitely all of these things but there are some faults hidden within the puzzle that is inside Jim Carrey's mind, or in his character's, at least.Overall, I like the use of the hand held camera and the disorientating use of jump cuts in the editing reminds me of some films from the 'French New Wave', especially the ones with the romance theme. This is all there from the starting blocks and the simplistic settings and exchanges of dialogue very early on work with these techniques well. The train is an ideal, romantic first setting and there's enough build up in the first ten minutes to warrant the reaction we'll feel later on when everything starts to go wrong. Interestingly enough, these jump cuts start to get more frequent just as we begin to suspect something here isn't quite right.The dialogue is clever as it hints at things to come, as well as staying neutral, harmless 'getting to know you' banter. An example is when the 'girl' seems to recognise him and asks if they've met before. Our hero dismisses it as a chance encounter at the book shop maybe. This is clever as if you notice this line; there will be more of an impact later on in the film. Good script and good story work, here.As the film wears on, there is a distinct element of eeriness. This is shown through flashbacks, although they're flashbacks with a twist as Carrey's character (Joel) is apparently 'witnessing his own memories.' Imagine what it would be like to stand next to yourself, invisible of course, in an old memory and witness it all over again. This is what happens throughout this film and there is certainly a touch of what 'Being John Malkovich' was like in the final fifteen minutes or so was like, only this time  it's almost throughout. What's also good about these eerie moments is that some of them have a comic touch to them, whereas some will genuinely make you shiver. This is a good juxtaposition to have flowing throughout.As well as this, there are many 'little things' to watch out for. Some examples include the changing colour of Clementine's (Winslet) hair, the disappearing backgrounds and things that were there before that aren't there now or have changed. This is why the film has such an alluring feel to want to go back and see again, but some other scenes involving other characters seem strangely out of place. Anything that's happening to people in the real world, outside of Joel's mind just seems pointless and the scenes are random and unfunny. Joel and Clementine are the main focus, not Dunst and Wilkinson's characters whom have their own miniature side story twist.However, with a strong and powerful ending (in his psyche, at least) and good, serious acting all round feeding off a good script and zany concepts  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind is a good film.",7,0,3,13 August 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," Don't let the title lead you astray, this is no fable-like fairytale; Leone's final film formulating into a mesmeric and thoroughly worthwhile three and a half hour opus.
","Once Upon a Time in America begins with some music featuring an artist singing of an America to be proud of; of an America worth dying for and a nation of which is generally somewhat better than just rather decent. The places Sergio Leone's 1984 film, the last before his 1989 death, will go are places not necessarily inclined towards painting images of the place as the song would suggest; his film an other-worldly and quite fantastic hierarchical tale told across numerous decades in the early to mid-twentieth century about kids coming to grow into adults but all the while living a persistent existence as criminals. The film begins at the ground zero stage of the 1920s streets of Brooklyn, New York City, before going on well into the 1960s; a stage by which time friendships have been forged; mistakes have been made and people have come and gone for whatever reasons. By the time it has ended, we are exhausted but in a strictly positive way.Despite being as close to death as he was, we don't necessarily feel Leone lost much of what made him the director he was. When a gangster rummages through an opium den with his cronies looking for somebody specific, he comes face to face with a female patron and her lover; a scene which is allowed to play out in that fashion that sees it oddly disgusting in its overall tone and yet oddly beautiful in its overall craft; that fashion Leone was always able to wedge out of such instances – a wordless exchange purveyed through facial expressions and feeding off of the threat somebody carries via their lowered brows and narrowed eyes. Such an instance is similar to that of how a group of ugly, disfigured bandits waited at a train station nearer the beginning of 1964's A Fistful of Dollars – their toying with the surroundings, systematically seizing and weighing absolutely everything up as what is essentially a hunt for blood takes a brief excursion, feeling prominent.The reasoning for the gangsters doing what they're doing is because of what Robert De Niro's David Aaronson, nicknamed Noodles, got himself involved in at a very early age and kept with him as he grew up. Leone has the sorts of people after Aaronson mercilessly gun down a young blonde and then beat a guy within an inch of his life in hunting their prey, a playful cut to the desired lying face-up in said drug parlour looking severely spaced out and rather vulnerable heightening tension. As it is, Aaronson knows his time has come; the curious notion of having a lead character in a gangster film effectively run from his both troubles and the enemy, when the comparable thing might be for confrontation thus leading to action. Aaronson's exit and re-entry to New York a whole forty years later is carried out in a remarkably played sequence paying sly homage to its own passing of time; specifically, utilising the sole words of 'yesterday' (temporally) and 'suddenly' (spacially) so as to establish an awareness of the transition from one era to another.The proceedings begin in earnest in the 1920s with Aaronson still a boy; a boy forming a clan of four with some friends and a boy whose chief items on one's mind lie in that of milling around with these pals, stealing a little something here and there, and the equally young Deborah towards whom he takes a fancy. We feel Aaronson has a genuine fondness for Deborah; the instance in which, through a corrupt cop doing things he ought not, he is permitted sexual relations of some kind however brief and crude, does not deter him from an overall goal of naturally coming to bond with Deborah. It is during these promiscuous times that he comes into contact with that of the slightly elder, but equally street smart urchin, Max Bercovicz; eventually played by James Woods. Bercovicz appears to ride into proceedings, indeed town, with his family on a horse driven cart, as if unreal; as if coming on in from the horizon: this mythical figure surely not even belonging to this realm. Aaronson and Bercovicz's oneupmanship begins mere minutes after they first meet, the targeting of an elderly drunk as a robbery victim seeing Bercovicz effectively come out on top over Aaronson but nicely teeing up what will become a series of fascinating crime infused interplay. The distinct underpinning of homoeroticism in the pair's relationship is fascinating. Overhanging it all are failed relationships with various women and quotations when things get heated, such is the way these two bicker like an old couple, along the lines of: 'Maybe I really should just dump you' or De Niro's gem 'Wherever you go, I go'; entirely encapsulating the nature of their ties.Without letting up, Leone's exploration of these men whom grow up out of the boys we initially witness is little short of tremendous; a firm eye on the pratfalls of a life of crime. The covering of the advancing through a life of crime by Aaronson and Max et al is as dramatic as it is fraught with a great deal of substance; an occurrence in which the crew execute a diamond robbery and then double-cross the employers seeing said instance unfold within an isolated coastal locale rich in grounded tug boats. The killing of those executed a figurative running aground of those, perhaps literally, previously having had to pull along the likes of Aaronson and co. – now reduced to neatly echoing the presence of a number of small tug boats in the vicinity: rusted, unnecessary and not needed – their time to be discarded has come. Leone crosses from strand to strand; decade from decade with ease, the overhanging mystery of whom it is is involved in Aaronson's calling him back looming over everything in what is a miraculously played, really rather wondrous gangster film that is wholly recommended.",8,3,6,18 May 2011
Taken," Rabid and unrelenting action film that teeters on the brink of both exploitation and as a dumb, guilty pleasure but pulls through on a basic level.
","Taken is a trashy, pulpy, throw-away thriller in every sense of each of those words and terms. It is a film that thrives on making the lead come across as down and as out as possible; one that thrives on making the people around him, both good and evil, come across as instantly and intensely dislikable as possible; and one that really thrives on rapid, cause and effect action which desperately tries to stay as realistic as possible but very much has its mind on the notion of escapism as it panders to a crowd. The film is a shameless action movie; a revenge film; a tale in which the women exist purely to be either rescued; act like complete wenches towards their ex-husbands; or get all excited at the prospect of a ride on a cute, four legged animal. And yet, there is a certain pleasure to be had out of it, a certain dumb but familiar sense of siding with the one likable character the entire film possesses, and just willing him on with a big smile on your face.I have an odd relationship with Luc Besson; anything he's written and made himself from what I've seen, I've taken to. As a writer with view to produce, his work's been ordinary to just plain stupid at best. Taken is a slight exception; a piece that more resembles what 1985 action movie Commando might've looked like had someone like Donald Westlake written it. It sees Liam Neeson play a divorced man, from a marriage that saw him father a daughter, but essential to the plot, he is an ex-CIA operative now working relatively small time as a bodyguard with some buddies from the government years. His name is Bryan Mills (Neeson), although at one point during the opening in a jovial exchange with a past comrades, he is referred to as 'Rambo' in what is another link to past, Reaganistic driven action film-making of the 1980s on top of the already mentioned Commando. The fact he is referred to Rambo so early on produces slight smiles as you witness what transpires.The inclusion of a friendly character very early on whom mentions Rambo assures me that Taken knows its place, knows what it is, and by the end, is hoping we're not taking it all so seriously as to despise the film as we watch on with our brows furrowed and our tongues entrenched within our cheeks. Bryan's isolation from his daughter, the antagonism he gets from his ex-wife and the fact she has a new partner anyway is enough to make you think he might just go nuts and wipe everyone out at a vomit-inducing, overly fluffy birthday party very early on. What Mills needs is his own noir fuelled franchise; with shady and fleshed out gangsters, a past tragedy driving the bitter, cynical and somewhat ruthless lead anti-hero whom isn't afraid to shoot first, ask questions later nor ask the questions first and then leave the poor guy to suffer whilst bound to a chair.Then again, we get some of that in Taken; a film that crosses its wires all too often but gives us an experience we enjoy without ever taking too seriously, but are immersed enough to feel the threat, helplessness and desperation most characters go through. After going to Paris with a friend, Kim Mills (Grace) is swiped from her apartment, along with friend Amanda, in a ruthlessly efficient sequence that makes Elite Hunting and their Eastern Europe set up-come-operation look amateur. After no help from anyone, Bryan takes it on himself to go after her and recover her, thus kick-starting a blood-drenched trip to Europe where people will pay.Interestingly, Taken is listed on the IMDb, under its 'country' sub-heading, as a French film and its view of France is a less-than-desirable one. I was reminded of the 2006 Venezuealan film 'Express Kidnapping', which looked at the frightening and harsh realities of what might happen if you're not careful on the streets of Caracas. In Taken, rather than integrate an individual city (in this case, Paris) into the story as it supports the basis of the study, writer Besson and director Pierre Morel cop out and somewhat disappointingly use Albanians as a means of getting across the antagonism. All this does is tell us that 'Yes, this may happen in a nation as developed as France but if it does, it'll be down to those immigrants whom have come over and set up their own operations'.Taken doesn't hit particularly soar, but what else can you say about a film that, unashamedly I hope, uses that laugh out loud instance in which the hero sits at a café, reads a newspaper and then reveals to us that he wasn't actually reading it as much as he was spying on a suspected enemy. It recalls that glorious moment in one of Nick Park's early Wallace and Gromit shorts in which the ever-alert mutt of the title acts like he is reading a paper, but is actually stalking a suspicious character; all played out under a banner that blurs the lines between what we take seriously and what we find amusing by way of pastiche. The film is a bizarre blend of often hard hitting material revolving around torture, sexual slavery and shootings unfolded under an umbrella of the guilty pleasure, and the idea we're watching Liam Neeson in the lead role; but don't let that sound like it's a complete load of nonsense, because it carries a certain watchability about it, something that you don't often get the chance to say about action films these days.",6,0,0,3 August 2009
The Mummy Returns," The Mummy does indeed return: displeasingly; in what is, frankly, a sequel at the lower end of what is moderately acceptable.
","I rather liked the first Mummy film, I rather liked its knowing attitude towards its rip-roaring and somewhat guilty content; I liked the way it had its characters just walk off into the desert sunset when everything had been said and done. The film's overall framework was satisfyingly closed, evil had been defeated and its undercurrent of romance that the lead and the leading female shared had been introduced as disparate at best; developed and then rounded off in a pleasing manner – if we'd never again seen Rick or Evy or Jonathan, despite how fond of them we'd become by the time The Mummy ended, we'd have been happy. Steven Sommers' 2001 sequel, entitled The Mummy Returns, does precisely what it says on its proverbial tin; the dragging of some of these people back into a firing line of stunts and special effects complete with a few new faces, most of them as unwelcome as the arriving of the film is as a whole and most of the content this time tired and dreary.As with the first, the film begins with a somewhat out of place back-story full of gory and grotesque minor details more broadly linked to a seedier bigger picture around which decrepit acts are unfolding. In the first, two people had an illicit affair which lead to tongues being removed from the mouths of those guilty, and for those whom got off lightly, live mummification; a process one ought to point out is wholly impossible for a duration of longer than about half a second. Here, we observe a great warrior and king in Dwayne Johnson's character, without provocation, gobble down a live scorpion after his power mad but ultimately failed attempts at the conquest of varying kingdoms go array. The reasoning for the arthropodic snack lies in the pact he makes with a war God - the wolfing down of a live scorpion its activation and the first of many instances in which characters do crazy, off-the-cusp things purely to lead us onto greater extents of spectacle driven content. The results allow the now infamous Scorpion King to sweep across most of his land, killing all in his way but arriving with the catch that he won't really be in much of a position to enjoy any of it since his soul is swiped and he is doomed exist cursed. Indeed, the conquest carries with it an air of pointlessness; I guess people were just more aggressive and power hungry way-back-when.Centuries later, in 1933, the O'Connell's, in Fraser 's Rick and Weisz's Evelyn, are back; here complete with a new face in the form of son Alex (Boath) as well as John Hannah's Jonathan who's actually the funniest thing in the film. How we can tell Alex keeps it in the family is in his activation of a number of pillars toppling into one another alá his mother's pratfalls in the library in which she worked during the first. Where they are is an isolated tomb somewhere, the family's introduction as a working unit seeing them intermingle and combine in an array of goofy ways to eventually get whatever job or quest they were initially there for complete. The opening, in its cave chock full of floors of creepy-crawlies is very post-Temple of Doom; the removing of a statuette causing the whole temple to cave in rather sub-Raiders of the Lost Ark. You'd have to be a very stupid person to go into these films not knowing that they owe a great debt to Spielberg's then-trilogy of Jones movies, but this just takes the cake.Evil forces, however, lurk; the bringing about of the High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo), he of the first movie, out of his slumber by a cult its revealed is way out of its own comfort zone kicking off all manner of nastiness – the ultimate goal to resurrect the Scorpion King and steal his armies and power so as to rule over all for once and for all. The film itself is peppered with an array of instances and happenings which do not makes sense, the bulk of it special effects driven masking wafer thin plotting; the troupe of heroes' eventual enlisting of the help of a black hot air balloon pilot a sort of replacement for the firsts' Benni so as to induce a love/hate buddy relationship with Rick just disappointing. On other occasions, the film will branch out into another back story in which that of Evy is involved; her premonitions of being present during ancient Egyptian times and in the company of Imhotep and co. handy for plot conveniences but arrives with the fact the man himself was in her presence and yet has never recognised her – to be fair, I suppose he's had a lot on his mind in the intermingling thousand years. Things lead onto other things; the encountering of some four foot high monsters nearer Johnson's domain puzzling in that they appear deterrents, but why wouldn't The Scorpion King want to be awoken? The Mummy Returns retains the familiarity of the first but lacks the fun, as if Sommers is trying to 'top' material which was never there to be done in any other manner than knowing and self-aware. It is epitomised by the instances of Rick's casual jabs at generic code and convention, which worked with the 1999 first film, but here, is delivered in a flat and disparaging fashion. Sommers is sticking true to what his returning character might say, even though it counteracts with what it is he actually thinks of the material, ie; as something that can be played for something other than smiles and smirks. Flimsey, loose and not nearly as involving nor as fun as the first; Sommers drops the ball with The Mummy Returns, a film which removes the pleasures of the first and mishandles the contexture to produce an effort high on goofiness more than anything.",5,0,1,14 May 2011
Avatar," Bloated and uninvolving effort that piles on dopey allegorical content and the over reliance on the creation of a world, whilst running on wafer thin plotting.
","The moment in Avatar you know the whole thing is a load of nonsense, and is more preoccupied with all things visual, is the moment the lead has a conversation with a superior clambering into a thirty foot tall robot amidst a hangar full of them. What banal dialogue follows could have unfolded in an office, or anywhere else; but no, it's in a large hangar with lots of other 'stuff' going on as well. The pinch is right there; the statement that Cameron is more interested in delivering things as big and as brash as possible, no matter how routine the actual detail going on therein is. Avatar is a plodding; numbing; stumbling; fumbling chore of an experience, a heavy; wavy film which stomps from one thing to another in a self-reflective, clumsily plotted manner; all the while pandering to a crowd whom, it seems, are thick enough to fall in love with a picture if it quenches the attention span but additionally carries some kind of coherent narrative complete with light substance. In short, it's a whole lot of fuss over absolutely nothing. Throughout the film, certain winged creatures that can be flown around on have something plugged into them enabling their taming, and under the rider's control. A similar process has happened to Avatar's fans: they've been caught, re-tuned to writer/director Cameron's vision and now they're all dancing to his music.Twelve years had past between 1997's Titanic and Avatar, if another twelve goes by before Cameron again graces the silver screen then it may well be too short-a time. But, the film covers the exploits of paraplegic American grunt Jake Sully (Worthington), an individual who touches down on a jungle-clad moon known as Pandora in true Platoon fashion, what with the coming down of an aircraft; the lowering of a ramp and the bleary eyed entrance into a world of violence and vegetation. Cameron shoots the new world through their eyes for our benefit, exemplified by way of the distinct, eye-level point of view shot that we get of the marines jogging down off the aircraft for the first time; a world just as strange and scary to him as it is to us with the odd buildings; vehicles and general mise-en-scene that surrounds the base camp, so we're plunged into this guy's shoes very early on.Avatar begins with Jake waking up out a long period of space rest; a fitting, metaphorical re-birthing into a new world (there's a lot of clumsy talk of 'birth' and being 'reborn'). Then all the build up of the locale begins. Local head of operations Miles Quaritch (Lang) spends most of the film strutting around debriefing rooms, barking dialogue. Also, he lifts weights; flexes his muscles; sits on chairs the wrong way around in an attempt to intimidate and stomps about in large, mechanical fighting units that act as an extension of his own power and masculinity. His warnings of the location of Pandora and of the things that lurk within see him make us aware of an off screen threat, an attempt to build pressure and an aura of both mystery and danger – 'There are things that can kill you and that are tough to kill' he informs, as the horrid scars of his own day one here act as a further reminder of the dangers. The principle threat is from the 'Na'vi'; a tall, blue alien species.Then there is the location, the lush and dense location of Pandora; a mixture of the jungles of East Asia with what it's like being in some of the more larger greenhouses at the site of London's Kew Gardens. People have come away awe struck, their defences of the film have revolved around the effects and the visual factor but slap the film on a television screen, in two dimensions, and maybe have it play out in black and white and you and your argument would be lost, as there's barely anything to support the visuals. Indeed, there's a sequence when one character is piloting a craft with another and exclaims: 'Oh my God!' in sheer awe at what's around him, in what is a truly dopey 'knowing' moment; this time on what the audience reaction OUGHT to be to the same sight. Cameron's retort is: 'You should see the look on your faces.' but the look on mine was of a frown.Jake gets lost on Pandora, so much so that after we've had a little interaction with some native beasties Skull Island style, Zoe Saldana's native moon dwelling Na'vi girl Neytiri bumps into him with intent to put a poisonous arrow through him. Hark, a floating jellyfish-come-dandelion lands on the nib and saves him – it' s a sign; he's a 'chosen one' and Cameron's soft storytelling makes itself painfully known. When Jake meets her, everything on Pandora lights up; the plants glow and the intimidating atmosphere vanishes; foreshadowing the connection they have and the arc of their relationship.The would-be all-conquering American tyrant figure of Quaritch, a man gunning for his 'unobtanium' supply located within, is nothing more than a dopey parable while towards the end, I was distracted: it's a wonder the Na'vi aren't already extinct, as they've barely anything to eat; spend most of their time leaping from branch to branch a mile up purely to journey somewhere else and they go on cliff side suicide missions in trying to tame flying beasts. I can imagine the tongue-in-cheek on-set conversations Cameron had with Worthington over the recent Terminator sequel debacle being more interesting than most of Avatar, a film that has burrowed its way into its audience's subconscious in that the lead 'leaves' his current existence to become someone/thing else, much like you 'leave' your real existence and become someone/thing else when booting up a video game. Avatar exists to sell action figures and Pandora themed top trumps playing cards. I agree that Avatar was spectacular: a spectacular disappointment.",5,6,13,7 March 2010
Toy Story 2," Branching out and upping the ante in comparison to the first, but pulling it off with a certain charm.
","There's little doubt Toy Story 2 attempts to go above the 1995 original; a sort of betraying of the first one's rules in keeping the realism of these toys coming alive and interacting with their surroundings for sake of greater escapades and larger adventures. In short, it works; but realising how absurd the film may have turned out and noting how grounded and enjoyable it turns out in actuality, is the true pleasure. In conforming to whatever written rule or code of conduct the toys seemingly had in the first film, in relation to keeping the magic of their life a secret from human beings, the first maintained a wondrously consistent close knit sense that avoiding all manner of extravagant activity was a good thing; rendering the finale with Syd in which the code is broken all the more dramatic and involving. Toy Story 2 sees the toys commit grand theft auto; cause a motorway pile up and execute all manner of expansive activity in airports, on runways and other such public places without much trouble - all whilst seemingly going unnoticed. But it is to the film's great credit we become so wrapped up in the tale, a tale of rescue; honour and friendship, despite these absurdities; as the ideologies and the true extent of the point of their existence in both the protagonist and supporting toys are questioned. This is certainly one of the most philosophical films about a child's play thing you'll ever see.Like the first film, Toy Story 2 sees one toy excluded from the space of Andy's room at their new house after having successfully moved at the end of the first one. On this occasion, Woody is stolen at a junk sale on the front lawn of Andy's house during the rescuing of another toy up for sale; the crime perpetrated by an eccentric, chain store owning toy collector named Al (Knight) whom recognises Woody as a rare and expensive collectors item, also a part of a collection of Western themed toys from the 1950s. With an ultimatum in place, the going away of Andy to something called 'cowboy camp' during the summer holiday, the usual gang of Andy's toys in Buzz; Potatoe Head; Rex and Hamm venture off to find him - as Buzz and the other toys take off to rescue Woody before Andy gets home, the camera enjoys a slow crane upwards so as to encompass Al's high-rise which towers over all the other buildings as the magnitude of their mission is enforced.Primarily, the study of a toy's fear of being replaced from the first film has been updated to that of a toy's shelf life running out in regards to an owner's lust to continue using them. 1995's Toy Story was a circular adventure unfolding out of the Utopian space that was Andy's room, an adventure which saw Woody having come to terms with having to coexist with a newer, fresher, more post-modern toy as Buzz's own arc was explored in that he was not, in fact, a space ranger himself. Here, the venturing away from Andy's new room allows Woody to come to terms with the 'issue' or 'problem' of Andy's growing older, and that it too is a serious topic infused within the life of a toy one needs to come to terms with and coexist with, leading to acceptance.If anything, the film opens up with a mini-narrative of which resembles a short cartoon; the sort of which you might have play before the feature at a cinema years ago. The expanding of the opening short into this dramatic and blown out of proportion epic as Buzz Lightyear attempts to infiltrate and defeat his nemesis Emperor Zurg is systematic of Toy Story 2's own branching out into larger, more grandeur adventures. We ought to know it's not real, because Buzz resembles his old, deluded self. As the film develops and Woody is taken to a large high-rise marked with a sign in its reception stating 'No Children', so as to further infuse the watching kids in the audience to 'side' with the toys and further dislike Al, Andy's toys strive to get him back and Woody himself encounters Jessie (Cusack), Stinky Pete (Grammer) and a horse named Bullseye; of which the four of them combine together to produce Woody's Roundup Gang, a franchise favourite with the kid's back in the 1950s.The film is enjoyable in its inter-cutting of Al's own plight, which includes the bickering with some Japanese businessmen whom are purchasing the Roundup Gang, his strand providing short, sharp bouts of comedy; with Andy's toys' journeying to the building, as Buzz's superiority is emphasised in his cracking of whom the kidnapper is, and Woody himself facing a moral plight of his own in regards to whether he abandons Jessie, Pete and Bullseye so as to return to Andy. In particular, Woody's own arc sees him somewhat loose his head when it transpires he is quite the celebrity figure; both then and now, something that is observed and dealt with within the universe of the film as a relatively negative thing when said character realises there are things that are more important in life. The film wonderfully blends in all of this with its grander physical comedy and the cynicism of both Hamm and Potatoe Head, something that clashes with various other toys whom become involved along the way, one of whom is a second Buzz Lightyear doll acting as a short, sharp and refreshing inclusion. It's bigger, but not better; although thoroughly enjoyable all the same.",7,0,1,19 July 2010
There's Something About Mary," Hysteria aside, this is actually worth the time; a messy and full-of-mayhem piece covering several bases at once as well as certain others I'm not even sure it knows exist.
","There's Something About Mary is a healthy mix of content which doesn't really work with that of rounded, authentic laughs; of situational comedy which is most certainly at times very funny with that of meaner, cruder humour which most certainly is not. The whole thing just about forges together into a film worth one's time, although looses energy when its lead does indeed catch up with a particular girl whom he has always liked, but has nary seen for the best part of ten years. The film is well worth the effort when the humour revolving around a case of two separate instances of deceptive identity is in full flow; other things, such as dramatic reveals and twists feel present more for the absurd pomp and circumstance of it all, do not work as well. Irregardless, the film's odd air of genre hybridisation, as classical Hollywood-era noir appears to crash head on with latter-part 20th Century gross out comedic laughs, is infectious at the best times and only moderately annoying at the worst – it boils down into something worth seeing.We cover a perilous and injustice-ridden quest involving Ben Stiller's rounded and generally bang-up guy, Ted Stroehmann. At the core of the film are his desperate attempts to first get back to the girl of both his youth and of his dreams in the titular Mary, before then proceed to try and win her heart all over again. Along the way, narcissistic and unpleasant men try to sabotage his chances. Mary is the woman in question, and she's played by Cameron Diaz; a woman we observe cycling in the prologue when it was still the 1980s and the main players were all still at high school. She trundles along to said place of study donning a radiant smile; beautiful hair and bright attire - her scopophilic qualities reiterated by all of those whom gaze upon her, and she blots out the unglamourous looking other women as she peddles along.One of those eyeing her is Stiller's aforementioned Ted; a guy revealed to be a little different to that of the rest of the ogling kids, even if he begins out on a similar plain. This differentiation occurs when he steps in on a situation in which a boy at the school with special needs is undergoing a bit of a trauma. Helping him out and bringing calm to the situation, it transpires the boy is Mary's brother and upon thanking him for intervening, poor Ted's feelings for her are implemented to the point that the rest of his life will be largely defined her presence (or lack of) in it in some capacity. The fact the film takes Ted from sharing a domain built on voyeurism as well as an unadulterated lust to know Mary more personally before, most likely, move onto the next woman, and then onto the places he eventually ends up helps move the film away from accusations of it being crasser than it actually is.Things kick off when Ted scores a date to the school-ending prom for his actions involving Mary's sibling, although it all goes spectacularly wrong when he heads over to pick her up and ends in such a disaster that he does not see her again for the duration that allows him to get to the age of being the late-twenty-something-year-old author he is. Desperate, he hires Matt Dillon's private detective Pat Healy to find her and report back. Dillon plays a man with a big gold watch; a little tickle moustache; nudey calenders on the walls of his office and a set of general characteristics that just scream 'avoid'. What Healy does is bend the reality of Mary's looks and situation to allow for him to advance on the unbeknown Mary himself, something made more complicated by the presence of Lee Evans' character: a paraplegic English academic. Acting out of fondness, Ted takes to the road and goes to find her anyway.From this premise, The American filmmaking duo of The Farrelly brothers spin an often humorous film within which we are surprised by how much we actually come to care for what transpires. The Farrelly's actually do well to demonstrate their credentials as filmmakers and prove their ability to time a joke, thus moving the film away from just a flurry of cheap puns more suited to a secondary school playground, during the set up wherein there is a particular edit so well timed that the laugh is in the cut itself and manages to draw attention away from what was otherwise meant to be an instance in which the reveal of a man's semi-veiled genitalia filling the frame was designed to induce giggles. Most of the film's energy, though, does indeed derive from these early segments when we will Stiller on to get to where Mary is and in Dillon's laughable facade. The film could almost certainly be recommended on a level of laughs, in spite of its often veering sources for these laughs; but it is the bends and curves in the narrative as things develop, twinned with one of the more likable leads from memory driving a film of this ilk, which keep it treading water.",6,2,3,7 March 2012
Invictus," Infectious.
","Invictus picks up where 2007 Bille August film Goodbye Bafana left off; the man himself, South African political prisoner turned international beacon for peace and prosperity Nelson Mandela, has been released from prison and walks down a makeshift aisle of people forming in a public street to applause and apparent joy. Where we freeze frame and leave that particular picture, a film depicting his time inside Robben Island jail and the bond he struck up with one of the ruling supremacist guards, we kick things off again in Eastwood's 2010 film Invictus: a conclave of jeeps; police vehicles and an everything-proof car harbouring the man himself rattling on down a road as he formally begins his first day in office as the president of South Africa. If you're a tad scant on your contemporary South African history, or if you're just a fan of those rare times when two completely different films that happen to cover similar ground just seem to 'fit' when viewed together, then the two would make for a pretty decent double bill.As it is, I have very little knowledge of said subject but I probably know more of it than the sport of Rugby. Ah, yes – the subject of Rugby. The film depicts the short burst of time during Mandela's five year reign as South African's first black president wherein he united a nation previously divided over the colour of one's skin. From his inception as its leader up to the conclusion of the 1995 Rugby World cup, which South Africa has been selected to host, we observe the true story of how the man tried to use what was a predominantly white pastime (and the presence of which, to some, still epitomises the old racial government) to build a sense of unity, patriotism and new order during this early stage of his reign. The film is a winner, an awareness piece and a sports movie you've already seen that depicts a somewhat incompetent squad of sports stars coming-good, this is true, but a really engaging piece of drama told eloquently and reassuringly as if it were some kind of bedtime story.Morgan Freeman plays Mandela, a man taking control of a shattered nation coming out of decades of oppression guided towards the black population, and with troubles so deep that they extend to the petty squabbles within his own bureau between white security guards and black security guards. When we watch him driven during that opening scene, we observe the lush green turf and spanking pavilion the whites have access to for their rugby juxtaposed with the blacks, and their groggy looking football pitch fit for no one. Not a million miles away is Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar, the true-to-life rugby player and incumbent captain of the South African national side, nicknamed the Springboks. His team's in a mess, they can't win; he's the leader to whom everyone looks; he's got a shattered group of whoever in need of a kick-start – Mandela's just inherited a shattered nation, few things are going right in this fascist aftermath and he's got to rebuild things too: they've BOTH got to troubles. If only there was some sort of compromise that could help both of them...The film does indeed go on to depict these two men bound by their respective responsibilities of leadership in wildly different fields, but a pairing of racial and sociological binaries in the sense Pienaar is this rugby player and rugby represents everything old and nasty. An early couple of instances at a rugby international against the English encapsulate both issues: the South Africans are trounced at home by a northern hemisphere team, while South African fans wave both the old and new South African flags-alike in disparate parts of the grandstands epitomising imbalance. We enjoy watching Mandela, away from his political duties that his peers around him deem far more important, become more and more transfixed by this game and the build up around the global event due to arrive on their shores. Drawing on inspiration from narrative film building blocks of the sports genre, as well as arriving with that sense of freshness inherent with sports films that depict people non-synonymous with the sport their undertaking (or not overly synonymous with success AT it), the strand revolving around the South African team and Pienaar's leadership works surprisingly well.Those obligatory scenes, when we recall the film has been made with the widest possible audience in mind, do not grate as much as usual in films of this ilk. When Pienaar makes the customary visit to Mandela's cell, he draws on the influence of how small this space is in comparison to his wide open, spacious domain of the rugby pitch. Furthermore, expositional lines reiterating Mandela's position of being in prison for so long but coming out again without the malice felt towards those responsible for the imprisonment are instances those who know a bit of history, or are familiar with our aforementioned Goodbye Bafana, do not need. Regardless, we are behind the film; we care, and we care because we've been presented with these characters and their problems in a manner more than competent enough in a film making sense. When the 'Boks thrash the Samoan team early on, the opposition are shot as faceless and anonymous: Eastwood really forcing our eye to meet with the South African team in their rugged and workmanlike glory as they do the job as convincingly as they do. The film is a powerful and engaging drama; another one of those 'gentle' Eastwood entries into the directorial canon of his, as he sways against his acting 'type' of the 1970s and 80s with another film dealing with violence; bigotry and such rather than use as a means to propel stuff. It's worth a look.",7,1,2,23 February 2013
The Last Samurai," Amply unfolded, albeit with a real sense of nuts and bolts execution at work, Zwick's film drags us around but ultimately into a world of alienation and shifting attitudes.
","When we first observe the lead in Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai, he is sitting alone in a small room, looking dishevelled, backstage somewhere, as his presence at the evening's function he is partly hosting is verbally stirred to a large crowd. He looks rather despondent, as if only something akin to that of a house-fire could get him to shift out of his chair; around him, crumpled up American flags of the era lie strewn around encapsulating how it is he feels about both the nation he is presently in and the sorts of things more broadly linked to that of the warfare in which they are engaging. The man makes intermittent use of a bottle of hard liquor, both later whilst on-stage as well as now; each of these things seeing him firmly within a state of disenchantment and dissatisfaction at where he currently is in life. Whom he is, is Nathan Algren, played here by American actor Tom Cruise; what he is, is a fearsome Civil War Captain and all-round warrior figure whose experiences on the front line of America's untamed west in the 1870s has led him to be what he is now. His eavesdropping of the master of ceremonies talk him up as one thing, when it's clear he's something else, goes hand in hand with the erratic nature of his later performance; something which should have seen the reciting of stories from the front but instead, has Algren scare the audience half to death with a loaded rifle – the entire episode acting as the final straw for a change Algren sees fit to apply to his life.That change, or turning of a proverbial page to begin anew, arrives in the form of a couple of cross dissolves; cross dissolves enabling us to leap to the port of Yokohama in an unobtrusive manner after a mite of exposition from those required to provide as such. Thus begins Algren's new existence, an existence allowing him to once again feel good about what it is he does well during the throngs of war thus incurring the reinvention of that drive to get up and fight once more for a cause. Edward Zwick's film goes on to formulate into a neat little war film-come-character study, something with an eye on the grandeur; an eye on the sweeping, all-embracing drama of it all in spite of the actual nucleus of what it is that's interesting here being the intricacies between varying cultures that co-exist as well as beliefs and minute shifts in attitude.The seeds of Algren's arc to a happier existence begins with a small clan of Japanese warriors at war with those of whom occupy similar grounds. He is employed by the existing Japanese Emperor to whip an army of runts into shape; an army of whose recruits are without the necessary skills needed to take on this additional force in combat, of whom are a renegade bunch that have already up-and-gone off into the wilderness under the tutelage of a Colonel Kurtz-sort it's eventually revealed is none other than Ken Watanabe. In beginning with these troops, Algren is able to put aside all his prior problems with alcohol and begin afresh relatively quickly; his abilities as a warrior and skills as a teacher some would say unrealistically coming back to him in no time at all. His point of no return is established via his standing beside a large target and demanding a yet untrained warrior fire off a musket round; Algren is far from being afraid to die, and here displays a real dispassion toward his own life such is where he presently is.The crux of the film arrives when that of the opponents to The Emperor's army arrive; shrouded in armour and ominous looking masks upon greeting the battlefield, they are mysterious and carry with them a preordained aura. Staying in sync with introducing something as one thing before breathing fresh life into them thereafter, the eventual developments see Algren caught and held by this renegade bunch, a bunch whom actually come across as rather nice and are a far cry from the threatening, inhuman introduction they carried. The film beds into a quaint groove of training montages and a flurry of forlorn facial expressions as time ticks by; Watanabe's interests lie in sticking to an older, more traditional way of life away from the modernising and expansion of Japan those of whom in the Emperor's ranks wish to adhere to - the parallels lying with the fact Zwick himself is sticking to a very old, very world weary framework but constructing the whole thing as if he were inventing the damn idea.The film is not without a certain charm, nor indeed degrees of guile in its flicking through the necessary obligatory scenes allowing for one to overcome personal changes we are able to see coming and the conflict we observe nearing. Most of the early exchanges generally call to mind an awful lot of what Zwick did far more effectively in his 1989 film Glory, specifically those scenes involving Broderick's character and a squad of African-Americans, only here it is without the same level of bite. The Last Samurai is hit and miss; a film in which, away from all the obligatory shooting and slashing, lies an intricate character piece which works for what it is in the long run, but does enjoy a good action sequence in spite of the fact it is precisely these things that led its lead to the mind-frame he was in. Yet, the film is difficult to truly get riled about – it treads enough water to keep us involved to its finale and chugs along with a heavy, mandatory feel about proceedings, all too often leading to well executed, if rather tame dramatics.",6,0,0,26 June 2011
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Never mind being Lost in New York, something somewhere got lost in the transition from 1990's functional first outing and the nonentity that is the second.
","I'm not sure 1990's Home Alone was crying out for a sequel, nor indeed do I think the first film was produced with that of continuing the misadventures of its young protagonist in mind. Like any scientist experimenting with chemicals and procedure in their laboratory, burrowing away at what it is they do for that elusive formula which will make them famous and, they hope, the world a better place, American director Chris Columbus toyed with this project about a kid stuck at home; his family's mad dash back to him and a pair of crooks looking to rob his mansion of a home before happening upon something with a shelf-life. The first was a sweet enough tale, this idea of a child at home alone after wishing to be as such whilst learning some home-truths about the presence of one's family and, encapsulated in the supposedly serial killing road-sweep, that life beyond one's homely walls was a little different to what one originally thought. Boom! Ideas and chemicals and experimentations forge together to create something audience's respond to, Home Alone being one of the fifteen or so highest grossing films of all time at the time, and thus a sequel is spawned. Cynicism aside, it's important to establish Home Alone 2: Lost in New York exists for the cash and solely for the cash; a filmic formula that was stumbled upon and saw people react.In truth, Home Alone conformed to that of a closed narrative structure; by which we mean his stance on things were introduced, befell a catalyst which allowed him to address his views and then came around to realise that things weren't so bad when you've got the sort of family young Kevin McCallister had and you're living in the environment that you are. The framework was established; developed and then closed and there was no room for further development. Lost in New York takes everything the first instalment did, as well as the places it took its lead, and incinerates them in a blaze of smoke within about fifteen minutes: this time, his reaction to his realising that he's all alone with time to himself away from his family is greeted with a grin rather than a grimace. He is afraid, but only of getting caught.Like number one, it's Christmas time and the greater extent of the McCallister family are going nuts over their annual festive holiday. This time it's Florida, and this time Macaulay Culkin's Kevin makes it as far as the airport departure lounge, in what is an improvement of not even getting out of his bedroom the first time round, but gets mixed up in the rush and lands himself on an airliner to New York. Feeding off what had happened back home in regards to Kevin and his managing to fall out with his family over a practical joke at a school choir pageant, access to his father's credit cards and a wad of existing cash draws him into staying at an expensive hotel and gorging himself on the surroundings rather than turn himself in. First and foremost, New York City dwarfs Kevin; a montage getting across the scale of the place in regards to this overtly street-wise youngster is encapsulated in a tracking shot away from The World Trade Centre as Kevin stands atop it.Alas, a somewhat hackneyed subplot to do with the two burglars from the first one is cooked up; Joe Pesci's Harry and Daniel Stern's Marv have escaped from prison in amidst a riot and have come to New York as if European immigrants at the start of the century seeking opportunity and fresh starts. In direct opposition to his 5-star living in the mean time, however, is chief of the hotel floor Mr. Hector (Curry), whose gurning face is the subject of a dissolve designed to sync up with that of an image of The Grinch on television. Like those aforementioned bandits from the first, he is indeed out to wreck McCallister's Chritsmas cheer upon happening upon Kevin's scheme to live a high life on his father's card and by himself..Complaints with the first film came with its tendency to place most of its eggs in the basket labelled 'final twenty minutes', when a series of stunts and second unit sequences saw Marv and Harry smacked about by a number of booby-traps Kevin had laid for them. Here, one can practically feel Columbus nudging us in the arm and winking at us square in the face as the realisation the film is about to do what everybody responded to the first time, again. It was marginally fun the first time; here, harmless slapstick has crept up a notch to near full on body-horror: where a paint can on the bonce or a pellet gun round to the groin was once as bad as it got, one cannot help but omit gasps of surprise that Stern's character hasn't already been killed five minutes into the final act. This knowing sense about things only really mattering during these sequences is epitomised in Marv's 'knowing' reactions of 'Uh-oh!' as something else befalls him - a laughter cue is all that's missing. The somewhat brainless and rather unnecessary sentiment of the whole thing is summarised in the reason for the final act to even happen, that of the fact the criminals have been snapped looting a store thanks to Kevin's Polaroid camera and are desperate not to be incriminated further. For whatever reason, they ditch the successful score and chase him into this dilapidated house of traps having already topped the wanted lists as escaped felons anyway. People say Kevin's intelligence in these films is too 'unrealistic' for that of a ten year old; but with competition like this, are we all missing something?",5,0,1,8 February 2012
Up," Stands on its own as the animated film with all the individual high profile accolades; and Up is a pleasant piece, blending a number of fun ideas and affecting content.
","One wonders if 2009's animated feature 'Up' will be the mark of change in certain areas. Here's a film of an animated ilk that not only opened the 2009 Cannes film festival, but became the first since 1991's Beauty and the Beast, and only the second ever, to receive a best picture academy award nomination. The heavy spate of films throughout the whole of the last decade, those of a kind that saw them animated but rendered by way of computers, have enchanted and engrossed children and adults alike; but one wonders if, amidst the higher-ups that are entrenched within the nether regions of The Academy and premiere occasions across the European film festival circuit, those in charge have ever seen any of them as anything more than just a bunch of cartoons produced in order to merely satisfy and entertain. Up's recognition at Europe's best known, but not necessarily best loved, film festival gathering plus domestic acknowledgement at The Oscars, even if it was never going to win, might mark Up down as more significant over time than the creators first had in mind.Up's an enjoyable experience; a blending of physical comedy with a brutally simple, but certainly heartfelt, premise combined with a necessary amount of substance rolled into a package which suffices to a degree. No, the physical comedy does not peak at the levels 2001's Monsters Inc. attained, a film with a similar arc to Up in its cut and thrust idea of two hapless individuals (one little, one large) in possession of something they really ought not be as a wiry, spindly antagonist goes to extreme lengths to trip them up. Nor does it quite hit the heights of the previous year's Wall*E; a film that also had a somewhat lonely lead inhabiting a world that has significantly changed over the decades before deciding to branch out into yonder as all sorts of adventures and mishaps unfold. I imagine Up was pitched relatively simply, certainly if doubts were ever raised as to whether it would make its money back: it has a flying house; slapstick infused chasing; an oddball buddy teaming of an old man and a young boy; plus, it features a talking dog. The film starts with a young boy by the name of Carl Fredricksen (Asner) having his gaze captured as looks at a cinema screen, displaying one of those reels of news footage you got prior to a film screening way back when, are captured. The cinema screen looms over the watching crowd, an establishment of power is apparent as this young boy observes in absolute awe explorer Charles Muntz (Plummer) take to the skies in his airship on a mission to seek out the animal whose bones he has brought back from South America, but have subsequently been deemed fake. The innocence of youth, and that latching onto either a brand name or an omnipresent media story is captured; the reasons for which become clear later on when another young boy sixty or so years later, carrying an obsessive fixation this time with the great outdoors, enable Carl to suffer an epiphany when all is truthfully revealed and the true nature of what was so striking and fascinating is all but a letdown.Carl's ascent into old age is put across by way of a three or so minute montage, a life of which seemed to consist of home-building, balloons and a wife named Ellie. Following her death, the void that is that they never got to journey to South America together, despite Ellie's equal fascination in Muntz and his travels, has steps dutifully undertaken so that it may be filled by Carl in flying off to the continent by way of a lot of balloons and a lot of helium. It additionally allows Carl to avoid the wrath of some thinly drawn businessmen whom want his house and land for construction purposes, and whose appearance is made more unearthly in their wearing of shades thus giving them an odd insectile look. In the process of filling that particular void, he will gradually undertake filling another in the taking care of young junior scout Russell (Nagai), the son he never had while in time, Carl will come to represent the father Russell doesn't seem to have. Russell additionally has one of the more perplexing lines of the film; when he expresses his distinct shock at the discovery of a talking dog in Dug (Peterson), despite having just flown to Venezuela from The U.S.A. by way of a house and then encountering a bird that sort of resembles the long since extinct Dodo.Up's idea is clear-cut, in that Carl's there for adults wanting to will on the guy trying to pay respect to his dead wife, while Russell's shenanigans and often amusing antics will entertain those of his respective age range. But Up's heart is in the right place, and its instances such as Carl's emotionally charged reaction to Russell's innocent 'cross your heart?' plea as well as some basic mother-bird-in-peril/chicks-rendered-defenceless are effective without overly demanding we react. Like most of these films from recent times, the chase inspired finale in which physical comedy and all the natural surrounding elements combine to create a set piece is present. It's equally dramatic as it is funny, an idea for a finale coined from the removal truck chase sequence at the end of Toy Story. It's not of the creative nor humorous level that Monsters Inc. hit, what with its extravagant ideas and genuinely funny moments spawned by a number of doors opening up and acting as portals into our world as a warehouse full of all kinds of devices and tricks acted as the setting. Nonetheless, Up works; with a blending of heartfelt and comedic material which sit well with chase-come-thriller ingredients that crops up towards the end.",7,0,1,16 March 2010
Where Eagles Dare," An odd amalgamating of both action and espionage; but these Eagles just about soar, with sustained levels of drama and brash narrative reveals.
","I think we're immersed enough in the text that is Where Eagles Dare by the time the bullets are flying and the explosions are going off; where brains and bravery were key in getting into a heavily fortified base within the piece, the ability to be a dab-hand with a machine gun is all that matters for the film's final third in getting out. But Where Eagles Dare understands explosions, war and wall-to-wall action is only ever effective if those involved within are people we care for; usually, the whole approach to action film-making in providing us with dozens of nameless, faceless, armed to the teeth bad guys whom act as nothing more than cannon fodder to the viewer's favourite actor whom can spend an hour or so shooting up, bores me to tears. Where other such films die on arrival, Where Eagles Dare maintains a sense of interest and peril, predominately because it has an air of film-making about it and this is actually evident long before it has submitted to a forty year premature approach of pertaining to resemble one of those many soulless, first person shooter video games that subscribe to the above aesthetic of anonymous, token bad-guys.The film will begin with an opening shot of a large and intimidating mountain range which towers over everything, setting the scene for the predominant locale of the film and establishing the predominant traits in that sense of both coldness and of the unforgiving the film has. In an aeroplane, a squad sits dressed as Nazi German soldiers; the two key players of whom are Clint Eastwood's American Lieutenant Morris Schaffer and Richard Burton's English Major, whom sports a playfully inconspicuous name in the form of Jonathan Smith, in a film all about falsities and identity ambiguities. The film's games linked to these very points are announced shortly after this, when a flashback in a debriefing room sees a bunch of officials provide us with the necessary exposition detailing the mission these guys are on. As it turns out, they're only dressed as German soldiers and the aforementioned falsities in identity, albeit in a very basic manner, become ominously clear from an early stage. When the team arrive for the reasons they're there, Smith speaks on a radio without informing Schaffer; later entering a small cabin they've holed up in whilst still in a white, but more importantly, blank uniform as the American sits opposite still clad as a Nazi. Whilst he isn't German in any way, Schaffer's clothing at least suggests a kind of identity whereas Smith's blank outfit, as the camera zooms in on his radio hidden in a pack as the scene terminates, suggests ambiguity and an identify that isn't as clear-cut.The film is a 1968 co-production between The United States and Great Britain; Eastwood's cold, gruff and expressionless Yank action-man taking the predominant role of being there so as to shoot everybody up when the time comes with Burton's British character, with his smarts, is there so as to provide all the complicated talk which furthers what comes across as complicated narrative twists. In eerily foreshadowing what makes so many contemporary action films so bad, the film might be read into as a systematic foreshadowing of basic chief contemporary British and American attitudes to film-making, albeit in a very crude sense. Namely, a Briton resembling the more methodical and straight talking item to proceedings with the American making hey in spectacle and action. Granted, the film was made several years before Jaws began the unfortunate cycle we now associate with American cinema or the American action-come-espionage genre, but it is difficult to shake the respective auras towards either character and their nationalities within Where Eagles Dare.Everything leading up to the infiltrating of a large castle in the Alpine mountains of Germany, in actuality named The Eagle's Castle, is intricate; slow burning and really effective. Time is taken to find said cabin; find the castle; spy on the grounds of it; meet with some undercover allies; the task of scoping out the surroundings of the local town located nearby and the eventual entry to the castle. They're there to rescue a top military official whom its thought has some important details related to a top secret operation, director Brian G. Hutton applying by way of both Alistair MacLean's screenplay and novel an effective race against time scenario meaning the leads need to get on with it before he talks. Here is a film in which the characters most certainly shoot their way out but, if anything, do the polar opposite on entry; Burton's calm and methodical approach getting them in to the suited filmic atmosphere, and when the alarm is raised, Eastwood's Major is on hand to all but win the war individually as they strive to get away with, again, the film changing tracts at this point.The film's centrepiece is this bizarre exchange in a lavish, fire-side dining hall in which, during a film low on overall narrative anyway, suddenly smacks us over the head with a flurry of exposition linked to double agents, mistaken identity and plot which catches us somewhat off guard as everybody stands around dressed in mostly the same uniform. As we strain to work out what just unfolded, we're plunged into a series of tense shootouts and standoffs as the exiting of the castle is given similar methodical detail only with an action sheen; systematically asked to weigh up what we now feel about certain characters given the revelations, Eastwood's own blurry eyed confusion to proceedings aiding in our association with him, fittingly, as the film moves towards a finale more geared towards action. The film is rather enthralling for the best part, Hutton and MacLean know you cannot shoot your way in and sneak your way out but there is tension, enough drama and plot where there initially appears to be no plot to keep one rather engaged.",7,6,9,30 August 2010
The Fly," I've plenty of good buzz for this film.
","With The Fly, we have a film about experimentation; about updating; about taking science and experiments to a whole new level  a film about modernity and the transforming of the old into the new. But the manner of which these ideas and experiments are transpired relies quite heavily on an item of nature: a fly. The Fly by David Cronenberg is a film about the fusion and transport of different matter  ironic then how the film itself is a fusion of genres and is indeed a remake or 'updating' of an old film from the latter years of Hollywood's Classical era. Its themes and ideas of experimentation and one man's greed, in a way, to succeed over everyone else is an interesting point for study.The Fly does not hang around, opening at a large gala in which science recluse Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is out and about amongst many other people which is a rarity for the film and is perhaps a rarity for the character even before these events transpire. Seth is working on something big but he isn't ready to go public just yet as some of the more technical issues (such as seeing if it actually works) are not tried and tested, but they will be in all their cinematic glory.I think Cronenberg realises that the film is less so a piece of entertainment and more so a study of a decent into madness and depression through loneliness even though its individual is an actual fly for that period. But the film falls into the genres of horror and science-fiction; two genres that you would commonly associate with entertainment or escapism as film in these genres usually enter the realm of the uncanny or the fantastical. Not in The Fly and never does Cronenberg really come across as someone who wants to make a film about a guy who becomes a giant bug and cause damage, indeed his mindset and attitude is to stay at home and welcome the odd visit from female reporter who he met at the opening gala, Veronica Quaife (Davis).Then again just because the film does not go out and out to give you thrills and kicks, that's not to say it isn't entertaining anyway. The Fly is a fascinating little film but it never veers too far over into the pretentious or even further into the 'shock' realm. Yes, it's nasty and its special effects are pretty gruesome and the overall character mindset of Brundle once he becomes devoured by this fly's attributes and appearance are somewhat shocking but it is not a deliberate attempt to raise eyebrows in the sense The Evil Dead might've done with its high content of violence or Caligula with its high content of nudity.As a director shooting a piece, The Fly has several hallmarks of just genuinely good direction. The film can rack up the suspense; draw us into looking away from the screen even though there is nothing really there to be afraid of and yet every time Veronica pays a visit to Seth, we want her to make contact; talk for a short while and then leave whilst getting as far away as possible and that's because the film creates such an unnerving atmosphere as Seth descends more and more into his transformation. There is also the scene in which the transformation(s) are finally revealed, whatever they may be of, and the smoke that creeps out of the transporter ala mist over graveyards in horror films of old, thus delaying our seeing the results of the transformation and the tension is racked up.But Cronenberg isn't afraid of including the odd scene nearer the beginning to do with animal cruelty and nor is he afraid to have his lead character tear off his own flesh and pop his own fingernails. But these scenes exist not purely to gross the audience out but are included to inform the viewer of Seth's continuous decline into physical change. The smart thing here being that while Seth comes across as slightly eccentric and perhaps a bit of a loner in the opening scenes, his transformation from 'normal' to 'abnormal' is not necessarily a psychological one as a result of isolation and more so a physical one as a result of his own quest for personal glory to do with his work. It doesn't help that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time, either.But The Fly retains an atmosphere of horror throughout, aided by some nasty dream sequences in which Cronenberg himself gets to deliver a lava. The progression of Goldblum's physical change is the highlight here with any love interest or love triangle utilised to form the basis of the third act but there is no real problem with that here. The Fly will entertain and somewhat shock without ever truly feeling like that's what it set out to do in a guilty and unconstructive way initially. Ultimately, the film is a tragedy but it is one that takes down a sci-fi and horror infested route which isn't often the case in those respective genres.",7,2,4,1 September 2008
National Treasure," Lock this 'treasure' up in a vault and bury that vault so far down it reaches the core of the Earth and melts.
","There is a line in The 51st State (Formula 51 to Americans) where one character says to the other about a certain meal: 'Fish and chips mate, national dish' to which someone else replies 'More like a national disaster' before tossing it out of the window. This is the sort of line you might copy when talking to someone about this film: 'Entertainment, fun and CGI = National Treasure' to which anyone else might reply 'More like a national disaster'. 'It's not like Pirates, is it?' says Ian Howe, played by Sean Bean in a 'nod' to Disney's other overblown, underdone live action romp Pirates of the Caribbean. Well actually, yes it's a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean and that link should be enough to deter anybody over the age (or should that be IQ?) of eighteen as far away from this film as possible.The fact of the matter is; if you crammed in any more formula, clichés or nasty representations into National Treasure then it would probably explode in a bright display of British villains, hard bodied blondes and one-liners. But that's exactly what we get here and at a time when the big budgeted action adventure film is wracking in more money than you might earn for Internet shares that rose throughout the 1980s. There was a time when these films did not exist; there was a time when you did not need to go into a film with that nasty sensation at the back of your mind: 'Oh, I do hope this won't be another crap entry in the genre'. Sometimes you get lucky but the sway is overwhelming and National Treasure is one of those that catches you out.The film plays out more like an scenario closely resembling 'The Da Vinci Code for kids' than it does an all round, children and adults orientated action adventure film. There are no thrills, there are no spills; there is no horror or jumps or violence and there are no interesting characters; merely names and appearances written down on paper with the actors/actresses' names accompanying them on the document. National Treasure is a passage  it's a passage of scenes with no real logic nor fun, just complicated and uninteresting scenarios that exist so that 'bums-on-seats' specialist Nicolas Cage can come along and solve them.In fact the film is so bad when I think about it that it comes close to parodying itself. Nearer the end, one character states 'A jump like that could kill a man' as Ben Gates (Played by Cage) leaps off a boat or a marina (I forget) and into the water from a great height. No, a jump like that will not kill a man  not in this genre. This reference in alerting the audience that, in the real world the jump would kill a man, is second perhaps only to Jaws: The Revenge when it comes to conflicting the film's actual loyalties. The Jaws sequel scene in question is when a character states 'sharks cannot kill humans in the goal for revenge' thus contradicting the film's entire premise so for National Treasure to be on par with this sort of logic only backs up my idea that the film is really poor.But National Treasure is not just stupid, it is offensive. Nicholas Cage is a name and a face and one that will bring in the audiences which means more money for Disney. German pretty-girl Diane Kurger plays Abigail Chase who is, believe it or not, a doctor. There is a hilariously bad scene early on when Gates and his sidekick walk into her office and exclaim their surprise at the doctor being a woman  no surprises from me. As an educated doctor who collects coins, Abigail Chase exists only in this film as a watered down love interest; a love interest that is only made apparent for the very last scene when a dumb joke is cracked to do with lovemaking. Although there is another reason the good doctor is a woman in this film and it is so that the character's cleavage is given a few instances of screen time. I have identified this as a tactic so that when the main characters are talking and going over the next plot points, the teenagers in the audience can ignore these particular 'boring' scenes full of dialogue and focus on the some necessary distractions  how sad. And they call this a film.The bad guys exist in this film's world to merely spread menace and act all tough in an attempt to try and make an atmosphere. They fail because, guess what; they're European  how original. Sean Bean plays the bad guy, a British villain and what about his cronies? They're Russian  hilarious. It makes you beg for another Cold War so that these stupid ideas of the 'evil' British and Russians working against the innocent, fun, 'all for a good cause' Americans would go away. The same thing happened in Cage's 2007 film 'Next' in which the villains were German and French. Then there is Riley Poole (Bartha) who exists only to inspire dumb laughs at dumb times (which is practically every frame of the film) and to crack one-liners with Cage every now and again. How sad. And so, National Treasure soon falls into its rut of cause and effect scenes about something that affects Americans more than it does me; relying on the fact we must trust these caricatures and what they say is correct to carry us through. Watch out for my favourite part of the film: the gang have just escaped the museum and randomly, Cage grabs Kruger; shakes her vigorously and yells: 'Are you hungry!?'  Hilarious.",4,2,4,18 May 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Powerful; brilliantly written and consistently engaging, Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the greatest debuts if not overall films of all time.
","Reservoir Dogs, at least for me, is one of those films that sneak up on you in terms of long term opinion. The first time I'd seen Reservoir Dogs was after a wave of Tarantino enthusiasm having watched and loved Pulp Fiction, a film released two years after this little masterpiece. But I was disappointed; I felt like I hadn't been taken through the roller-coaster ride of emotions; laughs and thrills that I had been with Pulp Fiction, a few months prior. But looking back and after many further viewings, Reservoir Dogs has snuck up on me because I now value it a little higher than Pulp Fiction and bizarrely enough, I get more of an emotional kick out of this film then Tarantino's follow up.Perhaps it was my naivety in regards to independent film at the time that I didn't take to this after the first viewing, but any doubts towards this not being an excellent and spell-binding film have since been laid to rest. Reservoir Dogs is a film that delves into the past from the present, setting up several characters; situations and stories within flashbacks that all combine to deliver a hair-raising climax with plenty of other dramatic, some more gruesome than others, moments thrown in for good measure. Reservoir Dogs is at its very core, a brilliant and emotionally fuelled film that twists, turns, creates doubts and delivers on levels of artistic creativity, out and out action and stupendous dialogue without ever feeling like a gimmick.Some of my favourite scenes in the film rely on slow motion such as the German Shepard police dog barking in the cloakroom amongst the other officers and Cabot (Tierney) lighting up a cigarette as he gives his opinion on the false story, smoke flying up all around him as another voice-over kicks in. Then there are the scenes in the warehouse in which Steve Buscemi playing Mr. Pink and co-producer Harvey Keitel playing Mr. White deliver some fantastic performances aided with dialogue that sums up the situation, mentality and emotions running high given that scenario they find themselves in. But the film knows how to rope us in and juxtapose our feelings and emotions without ever feeling manipulative. Some examples of this is are at the very beginning when, after a quiet and relatively subtle breakfast conversation, Mr Orange (Roth) lies screaming and bloody in the back of a car Â– something has gone wrong. There is also the incidence when Mr Blonde (Madsen), during that infamous 'ear' scene, leaves the action to go to his car in order to get a can of petrol. These juxtapositions and toying with the audience sums up not only the brilliance of being able to switch between scenarios but also highlights Tarantino's skill as a writer/director.The truth is that any scene that takes place in the warehouse rendez-vous is just pure genius, whether it is dialogue between two or three people or the torture scene or the unforgettable climax. A diamond robbery has gone wrong and the immediate theory of an undercover cop crops up thanks to the quick thinking of Mr. Pink; the more outgoing and independent of the thieves. But this seed planted in the audiences mind is one of a few things we are to concentrate on throughout the duration. Twinned this, we get numerous flashbacks and, indeed, flashbacks within flashbacks that tell us a greater deal of information involving the heist and the characters past situations. But here several things work at once: Nice Guy Eddie (Penn) arrives and maintains there is no 'rat', perhaps disbursing the theory of a traitor, challenging the audience to work it out. Mr. Blonde is established as someone who is just out of prison and his awkward situation involving parole officers and such doesn't faze him as he accepts the new job from his former employees of the heist. This creates a dangerous opinion of him in our minds, further emphasising the earlier opinion we had of him when it was established 'Blonde went crazy' and shot several people, including a young woman. It is an appetiser for what's to come, especially when he has a policeman at his mercy; but my favourite bit is when we learn he went to a drive-thru restaurant at a time of crisis and with a policeman in his boot.But these criminals in suits are not caricatures of mobsters from other crime/heist films. Mr. Orange screams and squeals in agony after being shot thus expelling any 'tough-guy' stereotype we may have of these guys in this genre. It is later established to great effect that he is a very humble and humane person, with bigger fish to fry. Tarantino executes a film here with random flashes of violence such as the torture scene climax and Mr. Pink's breakaway flashback. He lands his pop culture dialogue with talk of Madonna; The Silver Surfer and likens Gene Tierney to 'The Thing'. It even transpires some of the guys enjoy Lee Marvin's work. Shot on a budget with the help of Harvey Keitel but written with a budget of a lot less in mind, Reservoir Dogs shocks but entertains; humours but does not glamorise and generally gives its viewer a kick every time they watch it.",10,6,13,11 July 2008
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Saddening and harrowing film that takes on a scenario to do with occupation before going down a route of questioning one's loyalties towards others within.
","The Wind That Shakes the Barley is the second film I've seen in recent times that recreates an historical setting and uses the English as a source of antagonism, the other being Braveheart. The great thing about these two films are their resistance to daft demonisation of the English and their triumph in putting across a humbling, or perhaps in this film's case, quite a frightening account of the sorts of people whom existed and the events that occurred in Ireland in the early 1920s. I think it's somewhat of a triumph for Ken Loach to present this story within this time and setting and not give either 'side' any particular preference, more so tell a story of an oppressed nation before veering off into a realm in which how control of a nation between two domestically opposing sides would play out.What elevates The Wind That Shakes the Barley over other films such as Munich or Schindler's List, both Spielberg films attempting to be 'serious', is that is doesn't necessarily take a certain side. We're all supposed to feel really bad when a Jew is executed in Schindler's List and rightly so and when that nasty German gets his comeuppance, there is a distinct thrill that the 'evil' has been defeated for all caused earlier. Similarly, when a Palestinian is wiped out in Munich by one of the Israeli agents, we're supposed to get another kick out of seeing a 'bad guy' get his just deserts following the introduction of events in the first five minutes. In this film, there are no thrills or kicks in seeing opposing forces hunt each other down or execute one another in retaliation for prior events; just a sombre and nasty feeling that humanity failed all those decades ago.In another sense, it isn't played for entertainment. When we're presented with a group of English soldiers going about their brutal business on innocent Irish folk, we feel bad; when the Irish retaliate, we feel even worse and then the English get one back on them and we feel even worse still. It's that unrelenting and brutally efficient action-reaction that draws you into this film, all within the opening forty minutes or so, before opening up into another sort of beast entirely.The film follows a young man, a young man of great knowledge given the fact he's a budding doctor and a young man whose career role demands he help or aid people. But the young man is a patriot, and he levels he finds himself attaining shock the audience. The young man is Damien, someone on the brink of leaving Ireland for England itself to begin his illustrious career working in a hospital were it not for the beating of a train crew at the station he was due to depart from. The beating tilts Damien over the edge as to whether he'll stay or leave; this followed the beating of one of his own friends after a hurling match. The scene in which Damien witnesses the station beating tells us that if he were to stay, it would not be purely for his friends and family who are at risk but more-so for all involved. He did not know the train crew in that scene but he is willing to stay behind and fight for the cause, not just for friends but for unknowns as well and this sets up a compassionate resonance in the audience's minds for this character.The film is divided as a tale about dealing with oppression and then the struggles the Irish had with one another regarding a new order following a British ultimatum. Initially, the film is a scale waving towards Irish and British acts of violence. Some of the more harrowing scenes include a torture session involving fingernails and later on, a captain or figure of higher order, being executed after having handed over letters to his executor addressed to his family telling them how much he loves them and that they will not meet again in this life. The film is a grimy and no-holds-bared look at this sort of set up, echoing the work achieved in another 2006 film entitled Black Book as a sort of look at a depressing and downright dangerous way to live although feeling distinctly obligatory given they're fighting for a right.But it is the announcement of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that proves to be a turning point in the film. The trigger for the Irish Civil War from June 1922 does not force the film down a route of political intrigue and mind-games complete with espionage more than it does create a pot-boiler in which allies must weigh up possibilities and Damien must come to terms with a new romantic interlude on top of things. The Wind That Shakes the Barley works because it's told from a perspective that really matters and initially, that perspective is of the victims'. Like films such as The Pianist and Come and See, a delicate and fragile hero is placed within a situation created by politics and hatred and the person must undergo certain changes whilst taking on certain duties, and it is harrowing just as it is fascinating all the same.",8,2,5,17 December 2008
Total Recall," Taut and often gripping future-set thriller with a real idea at its heart and a genuinely pleasing film making ethic to it.
","I suppose by the time Total Recall has gone all gung-ho on us, what with its shootouts and second unit stuff booting out the earlier chase; danger and mystery of the newfound scenario our lead found themselves in, we can kind of forgive it out of its subversive energy. That is to say, the overhanging ambiguity surrounding whether any of what we're actually seeing is real plagues the piece throughout. If it isn't real, it's somebody's dream and therefore one would expect to be presented with stereotypical espionage elements and arrays of action and shoot outs come the final act. It's all here: the mysterious phone call from someone who wants to help; the checking in to a hotel (somewhat mirthfully named 'The Hilton'); the jetting off (as it were) to the exotic locales and the rendez-vous' with the good looking women. And yet, how could anything of this ilk set this far into the future running on this premise POSSIBLY play out any differently? Therein lies the magic of this 1990 Paul Verhoeven film: long after one has had the arguments on whether it's a subversive master stroke of film making or merely a cheap sci-fi relying on age old concepts. On top of all else, it's a cracking narrative which in itself requires a careful, patient eye and mind so as to work out if everything holds together.Arnold Schwarzenegger steps back from playing murderous machines and macho commando group commanders to fill a frailer role. For a large part of the project, Schwarzenegger's character hasn't got the slightest idea what's going on and he's in quite a bit of danger out of the fact a group of highly skilled government agents are armed to the teeth and coming after him. He plays a construction worker, Douglas Quaid; a middle aged, everyday kind of a guy with an apartment of his own and a wife in Lori, played by Sharon Stone. We're in the future, a far off future whereby the planet of Mars has been colonised; is mostly inhabited by mutants and one can even clear off to Saturn should one feel like a holiday. Running a pneumatic drill at a quarry with best friend Danny de Vito by your side; pushing the subway to work every day and seemingly not being able to get away from the news broadcasts of trouble and strife between rebels and government agents on Mars, however, is wearing him down. Through the Recall of the title, Quaid hits upon a business who can put him in a chair for a few days; wire him up to a machine and insert 'memories' that have him think he's done something incredible during a holiday away. Something, however, goes wrong and he thinks he's living the dream (so to speak) without the final programming having been carried out – thus, an adventure involving all sorts of new and exciting people, as well as new and exciting places, kicks off and we have in our midst one of the smarter, better sci-fi/action films of its era.Michael Ironside plays the man charged with capturing Quaid, Richter; someone who's already an item with the undercover operative fulfilling the role of Quaid's wife and there's an amusing insinuation Richter is going after Quaid with the intent instead on killing him because of this. The action eventually shifts to Mars and a red light district already shrouded in political turmoil. Waltzing into a brothel to some music from Sonic the Hedgehog, we're introduced to Melina (Ticotin); a young woman who works there who breaks the mould in her appearance amidst the scarred, soft bodied characters including dwarfs; facially imbalanced personnel and three breasted others. It is from here the pair of them begin to occupy the frame for an extended time, taking on the sleazy governing official Cohaagen (Cox) whose own plans to wreck some serious hassle on the Martian inhabitants loom.Structure and pacing are crucial to the film; never are we overwhelmed with details and revelations, nor do we ever lull in proceedings as new information and such keep flowing. What works is how sheltered we, the audience, are from this strange new future of automated taxis and interplanetary travel. We are spared the external shots of anything gratuitous in this far flung future until Quaid has truly realised he is out of his element, something that aides the disillusionment process on both sides. Director Verhoeven keeps the action moving and the scenarios coming, really taking this premise of someone torn from their existence and thrust into another set of circumstances whilst running with it for an extraordinary amount of time: keeping it fresh, keeping it frightening, keeping it exciting. We forgive the film for its eventual descent into second unit dominated territory. Think hard: the moments from our dreams that are the most intense often happen at the tail end of them, do they not? They are the last thing we dream and the first thing that we remember when we awake. If nothing is real and everything is fake, the movement into the final act whereby intense shootouts and near death experiences are all the rage seems fitting, as this constant dicing with death as the denouement looms intensifies the experience. Either way, when the lead character awakens from this particular episode in the morning, it will be a scream loud enough to awake those not just lying next to them, but in the adjacent homes.",7,0,2,16 February 2013
Rocky," Unashamed underdog story about an everyday man destined to get his chance.
","Is Rocky really a 'sports movie'? You might see it that way because it's one of those films that boils down to a showdown – of the sporting variety, in which the man of the hour Rocky Balboa fights high-prize fighter and king of the boxing world Apollo Creed for the right to be the best. But getting there is the joy in Rocky; getting there is not about sports but about life, companionship, living, just generally surviving less than pleasant conditions but most importantly: belief, the belief and eternal optimism that something good might well lurk around the corner. Sure, Rocky boxes but it's a hobby, a hobby that he can't really nail for whatever financial or lack-of-skills reason. But what the film is, is a rising through the ranks of life; a look at an individual whom nobody would usually batter five-seconds worth of an eyelid to, and his rise to a chance at something.By the time the fight has finished, the filmmakers have chopped about so much and got across such a feeling of awe that it doesn't matter to us, nor the characters, who wins or what's going on. What is for 80% of the time a slow burning and very intriguing character study of people, shot on and around the streets of Philadelphia, suddenly becomes a frantic and quite deliberately messy blur of fists and hard bodies slugging it out in an indoor arena housing thousands. But it's a deliberate tactic, to throw aside all the realism and long takes of human beings engaging in human activity and sharing human emotions, and replace it with chaotic fighting to the point we may have to just glance away.There is a scene during which Rocky, played by Sylvester Stallone, is talking to a bartender about life. It captures the hypothesis of the film as dialogue about 'everybody gets their chance' and that 'there is always a moment when a nobody gets the chance to be a somebody' is played out. The film begins with a boxing match, a match that Rocky wins, but what follows are several scenes revolving around day-to-day life as it is revealed Rocky is nothing more than a money collector for a local criminal. The film deconstructs the idea of a boxer and does so through Rocky, a person that uses his fists to earn money but is a delicate, modest person whom you'd be hard pressed immediately label 'bad'.This notion is done so through the slightest of subtle hints to actual events and interactions with other characters. At one point, Rocky opts against breaking the thumb of a man who owes money to Rocky's employer on the basis of pity, but maybe we're not convinced this is anything special on Rocky's behalf. At other times, he bosses a delicate situation with a naive girl following a date that shouldn't have been but does so in a careful enough manner, suggesting and promising there's more to him than his boxing and crime-led line of work. Additionally, he keeps pet turtles, which he bought at the pet store said girl, named Adrianna (Shire), works. He takes care of them and they are delicate – going so far as to get their bowl and furniture just right so they don't feel uncomfortable as pets. Eventually, it is the audience seduced into liking him, and from whence comes the overwhelming fondness for the character.Rocky has a friend named Paulie (Young), who is a butcher of sorts, and doubles up as Adrianna's brother. He carries a certain aggressiveness to him, a character working along-side the protagonist but not as a foil so much as a visual representation of incorrect or 'wrong' beliefs. Rocky's attitude and spoken tone is conflicted to that of Paulie's outgoing, loud and aggressive attributes. In fact, so much of the film is this grounded and realistic look at everyday people doing everyday things that the film needs to pull a proverbial rabbit out of the hat to bring together Rocky and his destiny that is this championship fight. The event that acts as the catalyst is Creed's opponent pulling out of the scheduled fight and Creed himself handpicking 'The Italian Stallion' that is Rocky Balboa to fill in; on America's Day of Independence; which Creed sees as a would-be walkover victory, something that'll only confirm his superiority.But there's the first mistake, something that the audience themselves may well have been roped into making in the first place, and that's underestimation. The film highlights the arrogance supposedly superior forces have over their smaller opponents, a brushing aside of something deemed inferior or not immediately assumed to be 'of the standard'. If the film is an underdog story, then it has no shame in recognising itself as such. At one point, Rocky employs the help of Mickey Goldmill (Meredith), an ex-boxer from another generation, as a coach or 'mentor' to get him ready for the fight and seeds of doubt are planted within Creed's head when a TV interview shows Rocky as someone who perhaps means business. The film is completely unashamed in labelling Mickey as a mentor.The film captures how we feel about the fight perfectly. The result is not important. If the film had been primarily a boxing film, the fight would've meant more to its characters than usual and the film peels off for its look at romance just as much as it does its social commentary on the quality of living, in a place and at a time. The film lends more time to the development of Adrianna and Rocky as well as Rocky's getting by in life more than it does boxing and training for boxing, thus we (as do the characters) care more for the result of that romance than any boxing result. The film deserves the praise and attention its garnered.",8,0,0,11 April 2009
Eyes Wide Shut," ......but keep your mind wide open.
","There's a scene in Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut, in which the lead feels he is being followed by an unruly and somewhat antagonistic force down a public street. The setting is the night; the location is a usually bustling city and the happenings within the frame capture what's at stake for these people. A certain Dr. William Harford (Cruise) stands by a stand selling items; his surveyor at the end of the street, keeping a watchful eye on the good doctor, whilst himself perched between two very distinct locales: a large, welcoming restaurant and a sex shop displaying the latest in lingerie. In a very basic sense, and given what Harford knows at this point about the stalker, the two locales the follower stands between represent Harford's predicament: carrying on with what you're doing and keeping quiet equates in being able to carry on in life, best represented by the restaurant offering food, or 'life' - indeed salvation. The alternative is the sex shop across the road, the option to quash one's guilt about what happened at the mansion and spill the beans on what he saw and was told would happen. We are led that the repercussions, however, would equate in pain for William and his family; possibly even death.In one sequence lasting about fifteen seconds but running on some previous material, the film manages to touch on ideas of guilt and sex as a weapon or as a piece of blackmail whilst incorporating a certain sense of horror and adding to what was, up to this point, feeling like a suburban drama of some description. The brief shift in mood has us momentarily frightened, that a force we were not expecting in this 'type' of film does indeed exist, and possesses an ability to harm. Kubrick's final film, 1999's Eyes Wide Shut, seems to be a mediation on sexuality and the urge to further sexual ventures. Like Polanski's Bitter Moon before it, the film is about a male lead attempting to further his sexual horizons; with the hitch that he is running on ego and lust more-so a slower and more natural sensation which demands he should try new things in his own time.William has a wife named Alice (Kidman), and they have one very young daughter. They dress extravagantly, play classical music as they get ready for nights out and they attend functions that embrace public holidays and display works of art, all in the metropolis that is New York City. I'm not sure if saying that the film 'isn't really about them as a couple' is entirely correct, although you will not come away from the film with the nourishing sense of accomplishment born out of their relationship-come-marriage. Essentially, the film is a circular journey for Bill; beginning and immediately ending with head on and frank interaction with his wife. More-so for me, the film is purely about the male, in this case the husband, Bill. The spark that lights his fuse and refrains it from burning out is talk with Alice about how she once felt for a Naval officer many years ago, something that is intensified when his conflicting feelings clash following a call-out to a patients house. Prior to hearing Alice's story, Bill actively flirts with two young models at the function whereas at the home of a woman's dead father, post-conversation, Bill talks and interacts with said woman but turns down any advances.For all the shops selling lingerie; the naked lead characters and for all the nudity and fetishistic animal masks that come with that particular segment, the film is exceedingly un-erotic or 'un-titalating'. Why? Because there is a certain danger linked to these things: the already established sex shop is iconographically on one 'side' of the road in which the lead could cross, but it would spell disaster; the naked women lying motionless in a recreational room is there because of a drug overdose while the outrageous sequence of several naked bodies wandering around a large house and having intercourse over a soundtrack of odd chanting instills fear more than anything else born out of the fact that we, the lead character, should not be there – and are in grave danger.Bill's further descent is emphasised when a group of young men call into question his sexuality, accusing him of looking like a homosexual and when his stumbling into a jazz club and an interaction with a musician he's known of for years going back to medical school prods things along, there's no going back upon hearing of a strange place in which strange goings on occur. The film works well and stands up to Kubrick's prior work, with the entire de-robing sequence being able to be placed on that mantle with any other 'out there' sequence from Kubrick's work: scenes such as Slim Pickens' riding of the atomic bomb and the visionary sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey as the lead journeys to where only very few, if any, have ever been before.Eyes Wide Shut is an accomplished film; a piece that carries dramatic weight and retains its focus and guile. The film is frightening, but it is the nature of human beings that scares us the most in the picture; and those with such carefree attitudes to sexual goings on around them: the owner of a clothes shop regarding what he can do with his daughter and a certain Victor Ziegler (Pollack), who knows why naked women got to be how they are at his place but shows no real compassion to them: they are to be used and disregarded if they step out of line. This was certainly no shameful departure for Kubrick.",7,2,3,21 October 2009
Beauty and the Beast," Fairly Beastly.
","Despite having made the remark on architecture, it is exactly as Cogsworth says in the initial 1991 Disney animated feature 'Beauty and the Beast': 'If it isn't Baroque, don't fix it'. He was, of course, paraphrasing the old adage of resisting the temptation to tamper with something which is ticking along smoothly enough for risk of damaging it. But, for whatever reason, Disney have gone against the good clock's advice and thought their incarnation of the centuries old tale of Beauty and the Beast might need some reworking. The result is something actually quite wretched.It is a tricky thing to wholly put your finger on, but if you agree with me, you'll know exactly what I mean when I say that, after the prelude to the main event, which is the short story of a magical enchantress turning the castle of a self-absorbed prince into a ruin; its inhabitants into furniture and the prince himself into a wolf-like creature, something just begins to 'feel' wrong with this film. It does not disperse either and, consequently, the film never fully recovers.You know the drill: we're in France, prior to the Revolution; the middle-of-nowhere and a small town home to a young woman named Belle (Emma Watson) and her father (Kevin Kline), both of whom mourn the loss of a mother and a wife. A loner due to her interest in literature, she attracts the skin-deep affection of Gaston (Luke Evans) while, a few miles away, the castle of the damned brew in solitude. In her own domain, Belle doesn't quite fit in; the townsfolk consider her a bit odd, principally for her desire to read so much and she craves more than what she has, which is the same drill every other day of bakers baking their bread; nattering marketplaces; gossip and the like.The entire situation is put across via a song, but it doesn't feel right - gone is the magnificence of the locality the animation conveyed: the rolling fields; the mountainous backdrop; the wind in the grass on the hillside; the bustle of the town, and gone too is the sense of there being room to breathe that the animation gave the sequence back in the day. Belle, now seemingly living in the town itself and not, as before, in a house on the outskirts further emphasising her detachment, intermingles amongst townsfolk who, devoid now of animation, can neither move nor omit facial expressions in the flexible manner their cartoon counterparts could and so compliment the film.Arriving at the local library, which is seemingly kept afloat by Belle herself, and despite it looking more like a church whilst sporting a mere handful of books, she returns Romeo and Juliet, which I suppose is another romance about opposites attracting, although doesn't mention the title and so playfully challenges us to keep up with her in that respect. En route home, there is the interaction with Gaston, a vain soldier who has just arrived back from War and seeks Belle's courtship, but she is not interested. Something is amiss here, too - aside from the fact the 1991 animation made a point to render most of the other men in the town old; bedraggled and/or rather ugly, therefore emphasising Gaston's handsomeness, and that Condon's film doesn't even seem to want to adopt that approach, Gaston just doesn't strike us as nasty enough; as narcissistic enough.Through one thing or another, Belle's father departs the town; not for a fair wherein he will enter an invention, because he is no longer a scientist but an artist, but to... a market. Getting lost en route to a science fair, like in the animation, would be explainable, those probably not occurring very often, but encountering a fork in the road and taking the wrong turn en route to ... a market just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. He winds up at the cursed castle of the prince from our prologue, who has become the eponymous Beast (Dan Stevens), whereby he is captured stealing a rose for his daughter from the gardens, something he thought he'd break off to randomly do whilst fleeing in panic from a tea-cup which began talking to him.Belle's encountering of the same enchanted setting follows thereafter, but it just never ignites. The red rose in Beast's private quarters wilts and when it is done, the populous will be cursed for all time, but not once is there any sense of actual urgency. The castle is a dull, drab place; all of its interiors look the same, things feel confined. The choreography of the musical numbers is dull. The household items, led by mantelpiece clock Cogsworth and candelabra Lumiere, just aren't as enchanting; have been stripped of all character, to the extent that Cogsworth might not even have been in the film at all. Their interplay used to be genuinely funny, the way the animation had them hop around the castle gave them character - things are just hollow now and you can barely even see their faces. The centrepiece, the ballroom dance between the two titular characters, does not have one-tenth of the majesty that the animation had, and it certainly isn't backed up by Emma Thompson screeching her way through the accompanying number.Alas, very little works at all, I'm afraid. Condon's film seemed tonally tentative, as if scared of being too scary; a route the animation was not afraid of going down - this is mushier, clumsier; made for families whose children are under seven and who seem to need abrupt shifts in tone to keep up. By half-way, I just wish I was watching the animation again. I'd be surprised if the same wasn't the case with you.",5,0,1,28 September 2019
Departures," Far from a Departure in form from in a recent canon of decent Japanese films, this film's exploring of a man in a niche career makes for impressive viewing.
","For a film so wholly indebted to death and the deceased, beginning with its title that alludes to such things and carrying on in the nature of what it is the lead eventually comes to do, it is quite remarkable just how celebratory of living Yôjirô Takita's Departures really is; a piece using these means and specific content more inclined towards those whom have passed as items for breathing life into a person's existence. Departures will eventually tell the story of a Japanese man seemingly approaching his middle age, as well as the apparent crisis on its way as a result of getting there, whom comes to find something totally out of the ordinary, and in a totally unexpected manner, which goes on to shift thinking's and attitudes for both himself and those around him, in what is a quite often fabulously played drama displaying a good eye for black comedy and rich character study.Told in flashback, something I began as thinking was quite needless but brings certain resonances that creep up on you, the film documents a certain Daigo (Motoki); a Japanese man, of whom we sense is on the cusp of something big in his life, what with his partner; passions and skills he has in certain fields, but cannot quite pin down what. He is initially a cellist and a good cellist, but a redundant cellist after the principal of his orchestra announces, following a playing to a near empty auditorium we barely notice out of the fact the principal's pained expression dominates the screen, that the disbanding of the group is imminent. The following few sequences do very little to incline us into siding with Daigo; he slumps down at home in his charming Tokyo apartment and ponders, with his sizable instrument, just what it is he's going to do. His wife is the prim; softly spoken and rather sweet Mika (Hirosue), and she brings octopus back for dinner and tells him to cheer up 'cause he's still got her and her job brings in money and this nice apartment is still here and we all get to have exquisite seafood for dinner.Decisions are made and the pair of them move to Daigo's hometown of childhood a fair distance away, in the more remoter regions of Japan; once there, the gunning for a job whose interview and house of operations is barely distinguishable from any other place of business, bar a couple of rather large caskets propped up against the side of the wall, plays out into the coming into contact with something thoroughly out of the ordinary. This new job is what appears to be a cross contamination between that of an undertaker and a maid; a job without, I don't think, a name in the English language – a job whose role it is to undergo a ritualistic process of smartly preparing a dead body, in-front of their family and loved ones, before placing them in their coffins for later funerals: it is a job that few desire and even fewer, it seems, look upon with anything more than mere scorn.Early on, we feel this job exists merely to serve a purpose; that being, to pay the debts owed for the cost of his cello, a sum that, once eviscerated, will be able to see Daigo leave his post and start afresh with something else. This isn't necessarily the way, the film going on to document Daigo's exposure to such a career and his gradual coming to enjoy what it is he does in a refreshing fashion. When we first come to observe him in his new work surroundings, his employer Sasaki (Yamazaki) and the company's secretary appear odd or strange, even eccentric and whose socialism we don't wish to share. As expected, Daigo finds himself in the deep end early on, acting as an extra in a 'how-to' DVD giving way to his first call out with Sasaki seeing them deal with a body, whom has remained undiscovered for a fair while, acting as the inception into this chosen career. Daigo heads in, combating the sight of a dead body experienced for the first time as well as the terrible smell creating a putrid and somewhat unpleasant first exposure to things – all of it done and dealt with in a messy and comedic although significant manner.Running parallel to the audience's own response to the material, in that at the beginning the majority of us feel alienated; perturbed and perhaps a little grossed out, Daigo's coming to enjoy what it is the film is about stands side by side to that of Mika's discovery; staunch rejection and then consequent realisation that the nature of the man's work is actually both rather brave; invigorating to watch and quietly fascinating without necessarily being morbidly so. Daigo's boss and his co-workers appear to become more normalised without ever actually changing their general characteristics, in what is a gleefully subtle addition to proceedings as mindsets change and frameworks play out.Overlying everything is the fact that Daigo is a man whose prior exposure to death and the nature of grief has been largely negative thus far in his life; if not negative, then largely hollow, in that he missed his father's funeral on account of being oh, so very young and unable to attend for whatever reason, whereas the passing of his grandparents when he was still equally as young came and went without all those wondrous instances that time with grandparents can so often bring whilst a child. The error of Daigo's ways is in the dismissing of such things, the eventual job he acquires seeing him come to work with the deceased and, more important in this sense, those grieving before the understanding of the nature, or procession, of remembering one's dead that imbues this process is played out – the likes of which, with everything else, make for really involving viewing.",7,3,5,10 June 2011
The Descent," This is Alien underground; and even then, it's all a bit silly.
","The Descent seems to be a film that has tricked people; it has tricked people into thinking that what it is they are seeing is new, original and fresh yet at the same time: scary, unpredictable and violent. I would argue back that The Descent is nothing more than a going through of the motions that made films like Alien and the original Dawn of the Dead the successes they are. I remember seeing Dog Soldiers, director Neil Marshall's first film, and being impressed with how he got across an atmosphere of no-hope; how he set the situation up with the soldiers and how he actually had the intelligence to at least acknowledge what sources he was getting his ideas from: in that case, it was Zulu as stated by one of the characters as they held up inside an old country house  I liked the twist ending more in that film, also.Here, instead of trained soldiers who you would think are up to the task of defeating whatever beasts lie ahead; we are given half a dozen of your everyday British girls who are into boyfriends, clubbing, driving dangerously, hard drinking and..........climbing and cave dwelling. Here, you could say there is an excuse for the stupidity since they aren't going to be prepared for what awaits them unlike the soldiers were but then again, half way through The Descent; the women are strong enough and hard bodied enough to actually fight back against these cave monsters: and there's me thinking it would just be lambs to the slaughter but it turns out they're up for the scrap much like the soldiers were in Dog Soldiers. But wait a minute  hard bodied, trained soldiers going up against beasts of some kind in a last stand scenario? That was Dog Soldiers; it would seem Marshall has made the exact same film only replace 'soldiers' with 'women' and delete 'trained' altogether out of the last sentence.Yes, there is no originality here in fact Marshall has just remade his last film. The characters don't need to be women in fact they are written as male characters BY an actual male  Marshall probably just thought he'd be clever by changing the gender at the last minute; Queer theory fanatics will no doubt have a field day in deciphering what that all means, the result of which will probably culminate in them thinking the writer doesn't or hasn't known many women in the past. The Descent is Alien in a cave; but unlike Dog Soldiers, no girl ever comes up with the line: 'It's just like that film: Alien!' The film begins in a tragic and eerie way and follows on with one character, as they walk through the woods before they get to the cave entrance, exclaiming some sort of warning: Watch out for hallucinations; paranoia; schizophrenia; etc. is her advice  one question: why would she say all this and does she know something we don't? 'Watch out for film clones' would be my advice to any one about to sit through this film. The girl also carries around a hand-held camera, filming her expedition which is something I remember Tarantino announcing that he hated in an interview once: but the POV shot from the DV camera is more a spoof of Aliens than that of a cliché.Once we are at the entrance and in; the girls do their very best to find the smallest and tightest crevice they can in order to trap themselves into. They do a good job since one such scene involves a girl who it would appear is, (wait for it), actually afraid of small spaces that gets stuck in a tiny, tiny tunnel as the ceiling begins to move down on top of them. Then the first of, well, two twists: it appears that no one actually brought a map but that isn't the twist because one such character has some dark reasons: at this point you'd probably want to bang your head on the cave's rocky wall but then you remember you're not actually in the film since you've seen it all before anyway and haven't been absorbed at this point. Following on from this, The Descent for the next forty or so minutes turns into a series of obligatory jumps: I am amazed at how many people like this film  it can't be the star power selling it and it isn't the level of gore so what is it that's so good about it? The jumps, for the record consist of: Bats flying out into a characters face; someone looking down a narrow gap only to turn around and have a buddy in their face and of course: 'Let's show the monster piece by piece in fast flash-bys.' Ridley Scott should sue.I admit that The Descent had me entertained and thinking what would happen at certain times. This was when the team got split up and had to fend for themselves and the final thirty minutes reminded me of Apocalypto; a film that hadn't been made yet. The film's crucible is also much better than Aliens' (Cameron's 'attempt') since it engages us and doesn't resort to cheesy one-liners and mindless gun toting action. Instead, it references Apocalypse Now and Predator in two immediate compositions (coming out of the swamp/avoiding detection of beast) but also gives us a deadly game of cat and mouse between the girls and the monsters  often chase, often 'how do I get out of this situation'. The Descent wasn't a film I liked and can't say was great but it quenches the cheap thrills thirst although I was expecting a little more.",6,1,5,8 December 2007
Inside Man," Spike Lee goes to Hollywood, but takes his touch and his ideas with him.
","It appears that Spike Lee can do conventional; he can do genre and he can do generic. But to call Inside Man conventional, generic and by the book I feel would be a little harsh because it's actually a thoroughly entertaining and somewhat engrossing film about a heist (heist being the genre) and the actions and reactions that will shape the outcome of the heist. This is Spike Lee for the most restless of crowds: big name actors like Denzel Washington; Clive Owen; Jodie Foster and Willem Dafoe; sequences drawn out in suspense and intrigue as hostages threaten to out smart their captors and enough fast cuts and scenes of fast talking dialogue that furthers the plot and makes the film the fun ride it is. From what it sounds, Inside Man seems like a film that could've been directed by anybody  indeed, Ron Howard was going to direct this initially but Lee stepped in when Howard took up another project; I think both directors are very different to one another in terms of their approaches to film so for a film to be scraped by Howard, taken up by Lee and STILL to turn out to be pretty darn good just goes to show you.But underneath Inside Man's supposedly generic surface lies certain 'Lee' touches I've come to notice in each of his films. I wonder how different the script was after Lee stepped in; my guess is it changed, centrefold. The character's in Howard's film might all have been white but Lee has African-Americans; Jews; Chinese people and even a Sikh in his film, indeed all four of these ethnic backgrounds are hostages at one point, are let out at another point and then interrogated. The film has its Sikh character independent and strongly willed. He is agitated that the police forced him to remove his headwear and does not cooperate thus giving the police a hard time. I wonder how the scene would've panned out had another director that doesn't take time to acknowledge and respect ethnicity in films  perhaps the same, perhaps differently in a disrespectful way, perhaps there wouldn't even have been a Sikh there in the first place: we'll never know.But this is one of quite a few clever things Inside Man has going for it. This is Spike Lee doing action, this is Spike Lee going all 'Hollywood' on us but in a good fashion because he brings his touch to the picture and he brings his ideas and content to a genre film. There are numerous references to previous American films that have stood the test of time in the majority's eyes: The Godfather and Dog Day Afternoon; there is even a brief reference to the third Die Hard film that anybody who has seen it more than once will immediately pick up on; I read after seeing Inside Man Spike Lee had no intention of the reference, but there you go. However, it is a single quote that backs up my theory that the screenplay and script may have been changed once Lee came onboard and that is when one man states 'Anybody who has seen decent (Hollywood) action film knows what an AK-47 looks like'. I feel this is Lee almost announcing 'Yeah, OK; I'm going against directorial type here but you know what? I'm going to show you anyway by making this film in the action genre'.This repetition and use of reference to older, more recognised American films made by white Americans at the time could well be a personal commentary by Lee on how so few black directors make truly recognisable films. Indeed, when the character that states the Ak47 quote comes so close to being self-aware in the film, it is Spike Lee recognising formula and typical props used in these formulas. Spike Lee tells us he recognises the typical gun in the typical action film but deliberately keeps it in because he knows that's what people want in the genre  familiarity and formula, two words you would never usually associate with Lee. This also tells us that just because he makes Inside Man, he will not buckle under the temptation to go 'formulaic' on us in the future after his career of 'un-formulaic' films.Spike Lee also finds space to toy with formula. To begin the film with a monologue told by the antagonist of the tale is a twisted method of story telling in itself. Suddenly, the story is being told orally from the bad guy's point of view and in the past tense  that can't be usual. Lee also echoes some of his earlier work, namely Clockers which dealt with 'black on black' crime. The black son of a seemingly upstanding black man plays a video game that even the antagonist played by Clive Owen labels 'sick' since it is all about black characters killing other black characters. What's even eerier is that it is a young black boy who's playing it. This may well be an even more in depth response to computer game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas; released two years previously to Inside Man and a game loosely about African-Americans killing one another. But as a film, Inside Man works a treat. There are too many scenes in which the police and the bank robbers talk to one another face to face for my liking and that cannot be attributed to the breaking away of conventions because it doesn't need to even happen. However, with twits and turns as well as an enjoyable approach, the film holds up as a piece of entertainment; holding your attention close to throughout.",7,1,2,12 May 2008
Pulp Fiction," Just a thrilling, postmodernist roller coaster through several genres; three stories and one unforgettable experience.
","There isn't much that can be added that hasn't already been said when it comes to the modern masterpiece that is Pulp Fiction. I suppose to some it's one of those films that you specifically remember when you first heard about it; when you first saw it; where you were when your first saw it and what the circumstances were at that time. Given it has become so popular and so influential in its own retrospect with so many people having seen it so many times as individuals, it carries that sense of accomplishment and historical significance, perhaps not only on a level of cinema as a whole but to a culture  to a generation of active filmgoers post 1994.I can remember first seeing Pulp Fiction  the night before Halloween, 2003. I think up until that point I was naïve or immature when it came to cinema. Here was a film that gave me a prod; a wake up call to do with films as a whole. Here was a film that, I suppose, brainwashed me into a realisation that films didn't have to be progressive, linear, big on action and set pieces or of an entertainment value. To have Pulp Fiction take me through a roller-coaster ride of out of sync story telling (something I hadn't experienced in a film up until watching this); dialogue said by characters breaking down images of stereotypes; humour so black it has the power to make you put your hand over your mouth and shake your head in sheer embarrassment that you might find certain content even mildly amusing and just a continual flow of action, reaction and spontaneity that captivated me was a film experience I am wary I may never experience again.And while 2001: A Space Odyssey came close to delivering that same 'wow' experience about a year ago, you have to spare a thought for today's generation and their experience. Through certain websites that give you unlimited amounts of videos, you can instantly access all of Pulp Fiction's 'best bits' in a fragmented and spontaneous manner. I don't know how popular or well endowed certain video websites were back in late 2003, I didn't use the Internet as much back then, but I went into that initial Pulp Fiction viewing with absolutely no knowledge of any scene I was about to witness and came out someone who was suddenly into films; realised films could be different, almost experimental. I realised films could be influenced by previous ideas and these things called film 'movements' that were around decades before.So watching Pulp Fiction now recalls that first viewing and not the many after it, all of which were motivated perhaps out of feint hope I might be taken on that same, initial roller-coaster ride. Watching this film recently for the first time in about three years and having learnt and read a great deal more about the film and films that influenced it, it's no real surprise that I do feel it is one of the best ever made. Pulp Fiction taps into cinema of past years but reinvents and updates thus influencing a whole new brand of 'type', something evident in the late nineties but certainly now, in the new century. The manner in which the dialogue is delivered and the dialogue period seems less-so a gimmick with age than it did when it first came out. The manner in which director Tarantino audaciously flips from realism to escapism, often in one shot, is unheard of and best seen with Mia's visual 'square' imitation and the frequent title cards popping up to contradict the urban realism of everyday dialogue and long tracking shots of realistic people making their way through everyday locations.Pulp Fiction recalls a lot of Tarantino's work prior to Pulp Fiction. It begins in a diner (alá Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers); contains characters whom are young, in love couples that enjoy killing people/robbing places; contains Mexican standoffs (again alá Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers) and carries that popular culture aura that just balances the film on that edge between realism and escapism in a way only Tarantino could at the time. Pulp Fiction is a postmodernist explosion of sorts; combing genres of romance, crime, gangster and comedy into one package. Characters plant seeds of doubt in the audience's minds ranging from a potential date with Mia (Thurman) to the menace that surrounds the character of Marsellus Wallace (Rhames) and what he might do when certain betrayals are made.One new thing I noticed when re-watching it recently was the manner in which Christopher Walken's character prior to his monologue 'hopes he (a young Butch) will never have to face a situation like that (in a POW camp) and take on certain responsibilities.' This echoes Butch's ultimate act of redemption that is to come in the sense he will be a prisoner (of war, I suppose) and will have to take on certain acts of responsibility in being a saviour all motivated through the want for the gold watch around which the story is entitled.Another item could be the way in which blatant violence is set up to be ignored for a bigger deal such as when a bystander is shot accidentally by Marsellus after a car crash (but the concentration is the chase after it) and a certain individual has his head blown off (but the concentration is the very bloody car interior and what they will now do). Pulp Fiction is essential viewing for anyone that even remotely considers themselves 'into' cinema. The European influence and contemporary referencing is second to none culminating in Pulp Fiction: one of the greatest American films ever made.",10,0,1,14 September 2008
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Taking the British gangster genre to new and scary places.
","I've always liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. I've always admired the energy and the manner in which director Guy Ritchie doesn't necessarily tell us a brilliant story but does get across a feeling of urgency; a sense of desperate times calling for desperate measures. Lock, Stock very much falls into that mid-late nineties cannon of British crime films revolving around the youth of the day, getting mixed up in criminal activity rather than being out and out gangsters themselves. With Lock, Stock; you don't get the feeling anyone who's under the age of thirty really wants to do what they're doing, it's either for a laugh or because they're forced to.Films such as Shopping and Trainspotting could be seen as precursors to Lock, Stock. They were crime orientated films but crime orientated films about youth getting mixed up in irregular criminal activity such as drug taking, dealing and ram-raiding. They were not gangster films about gangsters per-se like The Krays or Mona Lisa  two films from just before said films' time. However Lock, Stock combines the two ideas of youth involved in crime and the gangster genre as a whole and delivers an experience that has you sit back, put your feet up and enjoy a runtime of smart dialogue and faced paced that still worked on me all these years and viewings later. The film delivers a rapid array of scenes and visual styles more akin to music videos or perhaps even blockbusters as transitions and gimmicks fill up the screen and aid in playing out the events.Along with Snatch. two years later, Ritchie took inspiration from Tarantino's groundbreaking Pulp Fiction and gave British audiences not so much a breath of fresh air like what Tarantino did, but an alternative  an alternative to the stuffy and somewhat clichéd image of the British gangster as a hard bodied man who ran industries and dealt with anyone who crossed him. The best moment that gives us ammunition to read into this is one of the final few scenes in the film in which an unexpected shoot out occurs in a sex shop owner's office. The 'clichéd' image of a gangster character utters the words after a great shock: 'What the (expletive) are you doing here!?'. This question is directed at a character of many years his junior and is a question that rings true from all 'stuffy' imagined gangster characters as Lock, Stock arrives: the 'lads culture' of the gangster genre has arrived and the old guard cannot believe it  best summed up in that one shoot out nearer the end.But this is just fuel for an oppositional reading and I happen to have enjoyed almost all of the pre-Lock, Stock gangster films that I've seen (Brighton Rock and The Long Good Friday are my favourites). The 'criminals' in this film or at least the protagonists are young, cocky and without too much of a care. They are not criminal kingpins; they do not have an empire to run; they have not served time in jail  they have unspectacular jobs like market salesman or chef and yet they are placed in a situation against forces much higher than them and can only rely on criminal activity that just happens to be on their doorstep to bail them out.A lot of what Ritchie does to tear apart the gangster ideation (both image and genre) is to do with comedy. A lot of the content in this film would never, ever be seen in any gangster film prior to 1998 and a lot of the humour would not be presented as being so light hearted. In this film, a 'psychotic black man with an afro' will sit behind a desk and a wall of screens displaying motorcars whilst sucking on an iced-lolly, something that both challenges what the image of a gangster might be and simultaneously tempts us to laugh at someone of this stature. Indeed when the film threatens to go 'dark' with this character over the volume of a TV in a pub, an amusing voice-over and use of subtitles distracts us from the uneasy conflict on screen. In fact it happens twice; this time the four lads of the film react with a sarcastic holler after the film's soundtrack has died for said psychotic black gangster's emphasised reply of: 'No'.Lock, Stock at its core is a guerrilla film but it's a guerrilla film with an ideation of: 'yes, it realises what's transpired in the past and now it's going to blow away the cobwebs and do something outrageous.' But as a film and a filmmaker, Ritchie creates enough ambiguity and tension through the job itself (which is well structured: they must get through the locked gate, deal with someone hidden in the back, negotiate the disguised girl on the couch and then get away but the comic element of the traffic warden keeps everything 'light') but he also pays close attention to his soundtrack. James Brown's 'The Boss' over Big Chris' looming figure works well as does 'Liar, Liar' as Eddie blags his way through the card game with a light Reggae track over some stoners works equally well.The film evens finds time to dedicate dialogue to the moving away from gangster films gone by. One character buys some guns of another and the seller retorts that 'sawn-offs are out' further moving Lock, Stock away from that old fashioned image of Brit gangsters and their sawn-off shotguns. People want more 'range' these days is another quip  he is right but the range is in the toying with genre conventions. Apart from bending all the rules, Lock, Stock is a fast and furious ride down slapstick gangster alley that, at least for me, still holds up after so many viewings  it's just good fun among other things and Ritchie knows when to keep the film dramatic amongst everything else that happens.",9,0,2,25 August 2008
The Da Vinci Code," A definite puzzle that takes some working out but is this a puzzle you'll want to revisit again and again?
","I can understand the upset and the controversy this film dug up and still does now. The ideas behind Da Vinci and his hidden codes were first introduced to us a few years previous to this film, by novelist Dan Brown and whilst I have not read that book, it seems this film is less an exciting and intelligent piece of medium to sit through and more so a slap in the face to those who have spent countless hours, days, weeks and months actually reading the bible. The Dan Vinci code does, I suppose, feel like a big budget Easter egg hunt  ironic then how something like an Easter egg hunt (something linked to but not directly involved with Jesus Christ) should be used to compare to a film about the supposed myth that Jesus Christ actually was.I think it's quite sad when a film takes on a difficult and challenging subject matter but invokes mocking and ridicule more so than discussion on a constructive nature. But then again, it's not like I immediately took to this film because I felt under-whelmed. Instead of being presented with an argument, having the argument developed and then being given an oppositional reading, I got a blockbuster inspired film with chase scenes, characters with guns, espionage and criminal underworld activity - I'm not sure how honest to the book the film is but if Brown has written all of this also, then it makes me think he's trying to do a Bond or a Bourne but uses religion as a front for the story instead of The Cold War or amnesia.The critical analysis begins as soon as the film begins; Robert Langdon (Hanks), who it would seem is the reoccurring hero of Brown's books, gives a lecture to an audience of multi-ethnical students about symbols and how they can mean different things: the Nazi symbol with Far East religion and the peace symbol muddled in with something else. 'Tonight, this will be our quest'  that is he will investigate these codes and clues and get to the bottom of it all, but is he speaking to us the audience? The students are all of different ethnical groups and nationalities; maybe we, the watching audience, are the hall of students being told what to expect from the very off. The theme here being 'all is not what it first seems.....' (cue eerie yet tacky music).And so Langdon goes on a journey. He is ripped from his world of lectures, students and book signings and thrust into a world of criminals, police and espionage when I was really expecting a world of intrigue, argument and debate. The one scene that demonstrates this is when Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen) goes off on a rant at his mansion presenting us with The Last Supper drawing and gives us his little insight into phallic challis meanings. Hanks plays Langdon with a stern face and a downbeat voice, he is a rabbit in the headlights but it is not Hanks' fault  he has nothing to work with; in fact I preferred his performance of the exact same nature in exactly the same situation in Saving Private Ryan (a man torn from his world and placed amongst war and everything that comes with it).The major problem with The Da Vinci Code is that it just does not inform, nor does it really entertain. The film might be quite fun, if you can understand the language of Latin; it might work, if you are lightening quick with anagrams; you might be engaged, if you know your ancient history and your facts and figures. The film might even work if you've either read or have a general knowledge of the bible, but toward the end and especially after Teabing's little rant you'll just feel insulted. Thus, it's a case of insult the one demographic that may be intrigued by your film: not a good idea. In fact for most of the film, we needn't even look at the screen but just listen to the apparent argument as well as facts and figures that are apparently being presented to us.It is a shame that the best parts of the film must lie within the opening and closing twenty minutes with most of the in-between stuff just filling in. There is a scene when Langdon and his female sidekick Sophie Neveu (Tautou) are about to be executed in the back of a lorry; it works and is suspenseful but these should not be the best bits of the film. Similarly, the same situation occurs in a church; the camera cuts to 'on high' as some pigeons flutter and disturb the gunman  the chance to escape presents itself. Another good scene, as is the exchange between three people over an enclosed coded map. One question, were those pigeons from 'on high' an act of divine intervention? All seemed lost but a coincidence saves the day; perhaps this little inclusion of a composition and an idea isn't actually there, maybe it is  but that's the theme: all is not what it first seems.There are other flaws that double up as interesting ideas. Silas is brilliantly played Paul Bettany, a religious freak who must inflict pain on himself but I doubt God will approve of the nun killing. The film unravels its plot points and twists in a fashion that forces you to merely accept them and move on than really give you a chance to appreciate and acknowledge them. By the time the denouement involving a certain character has arrived, The Da Vinci Code has used up all of its best scenes and put to bed most of its best characters. Still, at least it was better than Dogma.",6,1,4,16 April 2008
Rocky III," Stallone keeps things chugging along in this sequel, a film building on what was good about its prior entries whilst allowing for fresh avenues.
","Something rather amusing happens around about the midway point in 1982's Rocky III, a moment wherein it snaps out of a proverbial daze and realises it is, in fact, betraying its 1976 original's core politic. Ah yes, the original: that film about the underdog being able to pull through and achieve precisely what it is they want even though all seems lost and one is on a road to nowhere. The moment I'm referring to in Rocky III is, of course, when it realises it needs its eponymous and ever-present lead, Rocky Balboa, to go back to not being the the favourite for a huge fight with a hulking African American individual of supreme ability – thus, it plunges them back down the pecking order and into a situation wherein they must strive and train to get (back) to the top. It is a curious thing to see a sports movie as generic as this one begin with its protagonist at the top of his game and seemingly indomitable, but credit to director Sylvester Stallone and the team for worming their way around some tight rapids and down into a stream of engaging formulae that does not grate.When it begins, it begins with Balboa on the top of the world as the champ. Balboa has trumped all, often flooring them in the process, in a flurry of mean boxing ring set punch-'em-ups inducing a rise in ranking about as meteoric as how opposing boxers have tumbled. Rocky has his name and face up in lights: it is on the television and all over merchandise stretching to that of pinball machines. He is a superstar: he is Rocky Balboa, and yet at once he is Sylvestor Stallone – both men have been catapulted to stardom after 1976's initial outing and both are living this high life of close knit bonds; idolisation and fame. When we observe what appears to be Balboa guesting on The Muppets Show, and having a gentle box with a punching bag, it is in actual fact footage of Stallone on an actual television broadcast made possible through his acting and writing of the original film, while the use of fleeting moments from the aforementioned film winning plaudits at the Academy Awards is symptomatic of these blurred lines between audience's own awareness of Stallone's own off screen exploits and Balboa's fictitious achievements.Two of these matches have been, no less, that of fellow boxing champion Apollo Creed, whose own story in the second film was as interesting as Rocky's was in the first film and whose ego in the first synced up with how fantastic Rocky thought he was in the second. The portrayals sort of even themselves out, I guess, and in III, they're actually on pretty good terms with room for something more in the form of a mentoring relationship. A man has an eye on Balboa during these moments of fame and he is Clubber Lang (Mr. T), a man who stares on discouragingly from the sides at Rocky being lauded come the end of another victory as all others in the auditorium cheer. Lang makes for a meaner, cruder and more imbalanced substitute for Creed; a tough talking African American who has a habit of winning and sees himself as invincible. For the most part, Lang is the underdog but he is unpleasant and spits these tirades of self congratulatory euphemisms on top of derogatory remarks aimed at our lead – at least when Rocky came to hear or speak of Creed in 1976's first film, it was a little more along the lines of common courtesy and respect. Indeed, when Lang sees fit to go so far as to systematically insult the man's wife and masculinity, the film has placed us firmly within the camp of this time gunning for the incumbent champ over the sprightly newcomer, something which goes against the franchise-to-this-point's politic and something which is actually muscled into being inverted following an initial bout.As was with Rocky II, one feels you'd have to be in a fairly bad mood to come away not having enjoyed it. No doubt there are arguments that it is overly derivative, while there cannot be much denying that it is a tad simplistic at times. A charity match with a wrestler, two sports-persons top of their respective contact sporting worlds, eats up time and is a bit of a boorish sequence designed to induce cheap conflicting thrills, although it does point out how vulnerable Rocky is when up against a monster of a man whose desire and drive to triumph appears unnatural given the circumstances. And yes, there is that seemingly obligatory framework to do with Balboa and his personal life clashing with his professional one - his actual walking away from the field in the form of retirement an event which is lost and forgotten by the time everything else has been said and done such is the scope for brutish spectacle and emotional wringers, but it all pulls together.There is room for one of the more predominant characters to be killed off, in what is an affecting scene, whereas the subplot of two rivals from instalments gone by working together is a refreshing touch. There is a raw energy to the film, it keeps itself afloat by going over similar paths up upping antes: Lang is the level up as an opponent from Creed; Rocky has more to loose now in the form of a young son able to be conscientious of the risks his father takes; Balboa seeks training from a man who has been to the same heights he has and most come to learn that the only way from the top is back down again, in spite for prior perceptions of one's ability and status. As Stallone very gradually cranks up the affinity we have towards these characters, one cannot help but look forward to the following entries.",6,1,3,4 April 2012
Castle in the Sky," This Japanese animated tale of adventure, danger and magic actually happens to be a bit better than average; a rousing and exciting film.
","Are there many films that are as flat out exciting, enjoyable, well designed and well-structured as Laputa: Castle in the Sky? In essence, the piece is a B-movie but it's one of those B-movies which happens to throw a dart in generally the right direction only to end up nailing the shot with aplomb. When these sorts of ideas and approaches come off, there is little which doesn't work and Hayao Miyazaki's 1986 animation is one of these: an absolute joy of comedy; fantasy and adventure toying with switching allegiances and imagination in design. I'm a firm believer that animation often works best when it's working with things insurmountable to being ordinarily filmed; a medium which, when applied to cinema, brings to life worlds and people and objects otherwise impossible to create without the need for computer generated imagery to intersperse with the live action. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is one of those films, a project which allows for its creators to just go nuts, although within reason - to do so knowing that they will not be hampered by the potential for effects to overrun creativity and immersion into a fictitious world. There are, of course, instances whereby animated films have tackled 'adult' issues (ranging from true to life warfare to the toppling of self-possessed alcoholism and grief) in the form of 'Waltz with Bashir'; Franco-Iranian effort 'Persepolis' through to 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', and have done so rather well, but they were always preoccupied with bringing a visual flourish to worlds that already existed and the period detail (1980's Vienna, Lebanon and 1940's Los Angeles) additionally helped in elevating them above self-indulgent, vacant of substance, spectacle driven pieces. But these are few and far between, and it's not like the Japanese are immune to droll, often unwatchable, animations which blind you with faux-nostalgia and that terrible quasi-sense of magic and merriment abound in pieces such as 'Only Yesterday' and 'My Neighbour Totoro', where not an awful lot is happening bar the repetition of steps which had already been taken more rigidly and more enjoyably. Laputa: Castle in the Sky is about a chase and an adventure involving a young, 'farm'-like locale dwelling boy who's propelled into the stratospheres of action, romance and danger. It is, of course, pure escapism but it is charming and it remembers to get the little things right. Opening in an airship flying high in the air above what is later revealed to be the ground below of an alternate Japan on an alternate planet Earth set some time ago, insect-like looking sky bandits invade the affluent surroundings of the vessel in pursuit for a necklace that a young girl surrounded in suited bodyguards is in close contact to. She is Sheeta, a depressed young girl who doesn't feel like eating but is, for some, reason in the company of this small army of men of whom each possess firearms. Amidst the chaos, Sheeta knocks out one of the men guarding her and it's revealed she was, in fact, so fond of their protection that she drops out of the window to fall to what appears to be certain death. Nay, for the item attacked to her necklace has steadied her fall and allowed her to land softly on the grounds below.What she falls into is a rural stretch of land where the young Pazu works, a minor who does the hours and lives simply only to have this Sheeta and her amazing possession come upon his world. Cocksure and boisterous, he is not deterred from maintaining his whipper-snapper attitude in spite of a peer chastising him for something. With Sheeta, Pazu, who's a sort of epitome of the working class man in boy form, embark on this adventure with the elements from before chasing them as they strive to uncover the secrets of the necklace whose purpose is to lead them to the eponymous kingdom in the sky: Laputa. The film's setting, stuck somewhere between the industrial age and a futuristic Utopia wherein rocket propelled jet skis are designed within an inch of their lives, but when a motorcar shows up can only induce reactions of 'You don't see those very often(!)', allows perfectly for a rounded; neo-fantastical locale wherein grounded and recognisable characters and attitudes may exist hand in hand with escapist content.One looks past the film's tendency to depict its lead as an all-conquering, all saving epitome of leftist industrial liberalism – a character whose decision to aid an outsider arriving unexpectedly in a locale alien to them (although familiar and functioning to the lead) very much leads them to a higher and more spiritual plateau of adventure and discovery. Moreover, and where the idea that factory floor/steel mill/coal mine (delete as appropriate) dwelling leftists can vanquish enemies and embrace this new found intruder is inherent, one should look past apparent 'pro' annotations to what waves of Left-induced immigration spins on those already occupying the land, and instead focus on the fact Laputa: Caslte in the Sky is more of a cracking, gratifying action film with a lot of amusing second unit material that works a whole lot more than it should.",8,1,1,10 July 2013
The Untouchables," One might very well say it is indeed, untouchable; a superb observation of character and genre unfolding within the violent and unpredictable world of prohibition Chicago.
","Brian De Palma's 1987 crime feature The Untouchables begins in a small, but busy and somewhat plush room as crime kingpin Al Capone sits and receives a shave amongst bodyguards and the press. The film begins in earnest, combining shot composition with character action as this crime lord, quite literally, puts his neck on the line in front of everybody; for the sake of everybody and desperately attempting to keep his cool at the same time, thus echoing what his overall role in the piece will amount to. The shot composition is that of a bird's eye view, a shot that looks directly down into the room and all the activity as a caption informing us of America's anti-alcohol attitudes in prohibition era Chicago, circa 1930. The chosen shot suggests a vantage point, a 'see all' ability much akin to that of the birds which lend their name to the shot name. This is given to the audience as the entire situation is laid out to us by way of a caption, setting up a power struggle between righteous and the criminally minded of which we will go on to observe both sides of.Very quickly, De Palma has drawn us into the world in which we will be spending the best part of two hours, as Robert De Niro's Capone and Kevin Costner's Treasury Department agent named Eliot Ness, plus their troops, engage in a battle between one another. Capone himself even compares what he has going on with Ness as a boxing match. The film is a triumph, bringing punch to a true story; gloriously recreating a city from a bygone era and additionally a film with a great attention towards its characters, simultaneously capturing the sorts of strenuous emotions and feelings one must go through as they begin a marathon task from the very beginning, in a wonderful manner.Contrasted to Capone's introduction, which at once saw him in both a powerful and vulnerable position quickly followed by a zoom in on the man thus furthering a somewhat uncanny feel about things, is that of Eliot Ness. Ness sits in his study, at home, to melancholy music which begins when the scene starts with his wife clearing up in the kitchen. The entire sequence suggests a somewhat quaint; down-to-Earth; domesticated aura as this man has climbed whatever metaphorical ladder was in-front of him and is living whatever American Dream lifestyle he deems worthy of both him and his family. All this prior to his first day at work, as if everything he's lived and studied for has readied him for this: the job that is to take on Capone and his crime-infused, alcohol distributing team of lowlifes.Ness is greeted on his first day by some members of the press, but the stark contrast the film implies is their attitudes towards him in comparison to Capone in the very first scene. Here, the journalists are on his back from the off and it doesn't get any better too quickly. This is in contrast to Capone, nonchalantly engaging with the press as he entrusts his life with another man whom has a razor at his neck as a shave is half way to being completed: he charms them, humours them and generally has them on his side. As a lead, Ness carries the necessary weight which enables us to relate to him and eventually get behind him in his goal; aided by his house-set introduction, his ideology of not recruiting men into his team of whom have families projects a thoughtful and level headed persona onto us.Ness' team of untouchables to which the title relates are formed of an Irish-American cop, named Jim Malone (Connery); a young Italian-American sharp-shooter named Giuseppe Petri (Garcia), otherwise known as George Stone, and ex-Washington based number cruncher Oscar Wallace (Smith). Ness' initial meeting with Malone, an elderly man walking the nightly beat as a cop, takes place on a bridge; a symbolic place on which the ability to cross over on and into another locale whilst avoiding the troubles below is apparent. It's this initial meeting with Malone that sees Ness' world change, and their initial interaction half way across that bridge acts as the ultimate for the establishment of transition which certainly comes about.The Untouchables balances its material between each opposing side wonderfully well, quite remarkably, seeing the two heads of these respective sides come face to face just the once prior to the denouement. It's a film that builds to an exciting climax but doesn't need a gunfight; an individual gunshot or an explosion to round things off, indeed just a singular word during which a change of plea acts as the fatal blow. It's additionally interested in more specific, intricate things; prior to a raid on a meeting between gangsters on the Canadian-American border, the characters take time to observe their rural surroundings and the mountains and fields are in stark, disorientating contrast to the mostly night-set, concrete jungle of Chicago. At one point, Malone recommends the rest of the team stamp their feet so as to block out the sensation of the cold as they wait for the dealers to arrive, further creating a more intimate and sensual feel to the hard-edged, male dominated crime saga than it need bothered to have done. Such a sequence captures the film's overall attitudes to its characters and subject matter, that of intimate and respectful. Untarnished by later American crime films which would break-down the gangster archetype, most notably 1990's Goodfellas, and others which would add more of a visual flair to the 'crime saga' approach to the American gangster genre, such as 1995's Heat; The Untouchables acts as a wondrous example of right attempting to overcome wrong, all playing out with a meticulous level of attention to character and film-making.",8,0,0,8 January 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," Reloaded and somewhat annoyingly re-envisaged, but The Matrix Reloaded does suffice on certain levels of spectacle and ideas.
","The Matrix Reloaded feigns as if it sets out a particular stall early on, with some absurd content that consists of a stunt involving a motorcycle spinning through the air; landing into a building; blowing up profusely as a skin tight leather outfit clad female lands on the hard concrete floor, from an initially elevated position, and all of it in slow motion. What follows is an off the wall gunfight as further slow motion encompasses two individuals crashing through a window of a high-rise. But it was a dream; a blending of images of an escapist and impossible nature as the body rests but the mind rages on during the night in an overwhelming surge of imagery and sound – or was it? The Wachowski brothers' 2003 sequel to their hit 1999 film The Matrix is a science-fiction action hybrid which combines far more than two primary genres. Rich in ideas; high in kinetic entertainment and with a sufficient study of character, The Matrix Reloaded just about works.The first Matrix film was a very old, very classical and rather mythical story of a humble character brought out of his commonplace surroundings quite amazingly, which saw him reborn into a new world; a supremely disturbing reality full of new dangers and new ways of life; a place with both superior technology and enemies. It blended age-old story convention with a very old fashioned idea at the heart of it all (one that revolved around a 'prophecy' and a 'chosen one') with eerily contemporary mise-en-scene in its costume and technologically driven props. The Matrix Reloaded feeds off of that gross sense of hybridity the first film had; that combining of story-telling in the sense there is that core narrative idea to do with a prophecy coming true with more modern, slick conventions.If the first film had its bleary eyed protagonist Neo (Reeves) leave a familiar 'real' world and enter a new existence in an alternate dimension, then The Matrix Reloaded is more preoccupied with reversing that process. Here, rather than play the bland office worker turned mankind's saviour; he is the emotionally troubled individual attempting to deal with nightmares, maintain his relationship with Trinity (Moss) and the burden of said role as he mopes around in clothes that look like rags and embodies tender, soft-bodied traits. This is the flip-side to the life he leads when he and the freedom fighting minions consisting of old guards Trinity and Morpheus (Fishburne), amongst others, jump into the now newly rendered 'false' universe in which action; gunfights; awe-inspiring stunts and the very anti-thesis to realism unfold. In this existence, clothing; ability and general look take on a more falsifying nature as issues of a more personal nature are shelved for broader, more extravagant stakes. The process is not unlike booting up a video game, with intent to escape from whatever existence one inhabits in order to suit up as someone else: a soldier; a gangster; a professional golfer, football star or winter Olympian – all so that the chance is presented so as to take on more escapist themed odds than in a 'real' existence.The world in which most of the 'real' drama The Matrix Reloaded unfolds is one that sees its inhabitants wear clothes akin to caveman era rags, with the dwelling in caves a pretty dominant way of living as the place is lit by way of flamed torches. The setting is positively Jurassic, but the Wachowski's upturn the cart by including a contemporary rave party amidst all this, with another amusing moment capturing the blending of 'old' and 'new', itself within an action sequence, when Neo battles a group of enemies with medieval weaponry in a plush locale whilst incorporating modern martial arts. Whatever plot the film has concerns an army of killer machines known as Sentinels, those squid-like war machines from the first film, and whom are designed to destroy everything and everyone in their path. The moments in which they're on screen are sparse, but frightening on the off occasion it happens. These Sentinels are on their way to destroy Zion; the dwelling of humankind within this Matrix universe.The film's sense of both flash and urgency are exemplified in its race against time premise, a situation that sees the leads battle against the clock; 72 hours - an amount of time which is just long enough to get everything done as they strive to save the day and defeat the...........well, you know how it all goes. In an attempt to inject some heart into proceedings, the film covers Neo's continuing personal problems and Morpheus' direct opposition with a local commander named Lock (Lennix), both ideologically and personally when it's revealed he's someone whom rejects Morpheus' faith in the prophecy as he additionally engages in a relationship with Niobe (Smith), Morpheus' former partner.The Matrix Reloaded is ultimately an ambitious actioner, veering off into '2001' territory when an interaction with someone known as The Architect (Bakaitis) crops up; but you smirk at the sheer pomposity of the nature of the sequence as well as the direction the film has hairpin-turned down more than you do sit and admire a carefully observed piece which has beautifully woven its way to this point. I think the film wants to observe how man and machine co-exist, or can co-exist, within this universe, or a universe; but rather than play the thesis out in a subtle and relaxed manner; a certain character of the 'wise-old-head' ilk has to come on screen and explain everything to an insomnia suffering Neo. The film borders on near camp following an interaction with an eccentric Frenchman complete with Monica Bellucci pouring out of a dress while a combat sequence between Neo and a number of Agent Smiths sums up the complete ignoring of the simplistic, menacing, less-is-more aura the first one had in regards to said threat. Tiring, but Reloaded pulls through.",6,0,0,22 March 2010
Mystic River," This River flows magnificently; a lesson in direction as a variety of raw, human emotions surface causing tensions and sensations to simmer.
","I suppose the poster for Clint Eastwood's 2003 film Mystic River wants us to read into it in a way that pre-ordains us for the film proper. The reflections of three anonymous men catch our eye, the shimmering and disjointed figures making themselves apparent in the water as we realise, half way through the film, that the notion of looking at one's self; looking into one's self; realising that one is the way one is and must negotiate it is prominent. Such is the tone of Mystic River, a one-part detective story; one-part vigilante tale with a twist. It is a film that kick-started the sort of run of form for a contemporary era American director that had not been seen since Oliver Stone got all angry at the back end of the eighties and went on an invigorated 'spree' of pent-up film-making which saw him attack mostly everything of what America thought made it 'great'.Penned by American screenwriter Brian Helgeland, from a book of the same name written by Dennis Lehane, Mystic River is driven by Helegeland's rather deeply infused screen writing roots in working in pulpy, criminal orientated material (from 1995's Assassins to 1997's L.A. Confidential and then 1999's Payback) with his ability to pepper his scripts with distinct characters, some of whom are harder; weaker and wormier than others. It is this, combined with Eastwood's style of directing; that odd mixture of films with rich cinematography that carry a confrontational and knowing tone, as facts and situations are presented in stark but slick fashion, most of his films focusing on those given a voice when the chips are either on the way or already firmly down.One character in Mystic River wants a voice, he's looking for a way to just communicate what he went through as a young boy in 1950s Boston so as to lay to rest why it is most people think he's a little strange. He is David Boyle (Robbins), a man who grew up with fellow Boston citizens Jimmy Markum (Penn) and Sean Devine (Bacon), with each of these three taking to very different paths as they grew up: Sean is a police officer; Markum a local gangster big-shot with David sort of landing half way as a guy we're led to believe is capable of some pretty terrible things on top of the fact he himself is a victim of gross wrong-doing. Mystic River has plots going on on top of, and below, other plots. The relations characters have between one another are deep and layered, as things kick off on a number of strands, all of which carry sub-plots; character motivations and developments. The film sees Eastwood revisit ground made more famous by his Dirty Harry exploits in the exploring of the role of the vigilante as three different plights of searching for their own version of justice are juggled: a justice of a righteous nature for Devine; one of a personal nature running on love and respect for a family member for Markum and of an ill-advised nature running on hatred and prior wrong-doing for Boyle. It is Devine who captures what I think most of the characters feel most often in Mystic River: he stands on the bridge into the city following the looking at the aftermath of a car crash, gazing over the distant skyline in a rueful and knowing manner, making do with his role tackling the city's more grizzlier goings-on and a failed relationship in which a woman will not even talk to him down the phone despite calling him. The event which binds everyone and rekindles past acquaintances leading to this exploration of fate, exemplified in Boyle's rueful reminiscing as to what everything might have been like had one of the other two boys got into a makeshift police officer's car whilst they were all young, is the death of Katie Markum (Rossum); Jimmy's young daughter. Penn plays a man attempting to deal with the grief of such a loss, in doing so balancing the fact that he didn't really know her with the hunt for her killer, whom he wants before the police find him, with the close ties within his own network that threaten to fall apart: an altercation at one point with a friend and confidant named Theo is an example of how one event can ripple down into the lives of others, capturing what keeps the core of Mystic River beating â€“ and Penn plays it wonderfully. But everything is finely distributed, the crux of Boyle's story coming out when his wife walks in on him watching a horror film and the notion of being a vampire is hit upon by Boyle as something that would see you along the lines of being 'Undead, but still sort of alive on the outside', echoing his own predicament in life as someone who once felt alive until something terrible befell him. The use of lighting as Eastwood blots out half of Boyle's face in darkness works well given his entire arc, that notion of 'just' and 'unjust' co-existing as one.Eastwood manages to balance the respective plights of these three men brilliantly, with the grief on one stand and the searching for the truth on another whilst a pot-boiler simmers on a third level; neither one overwhelming the other nor presented as spectacle. So often now is the way, predominantly due to the influence from a number of TV detective shows, that police officers need to be exploring grandeur cases and shooting around the place under the guise of an energetic aesthetic. Eastwood substitutes this with character study and a burning tension, the likes of which are so much easier to invest in. The opening scene shows three boys and their want for names and identification to remain etched forever; Mystic River then provides a tragic story of how names may well stick but leashing one's identity is an altogether different task.",8,1,1,6 April 2010
Zombieland," Vaunted but overpraised horror comedy, which is too wild and referential to really enjoy
","'Zombieland' is a post-modern explosion of all things pop-culture and something else. I lost count of the number of references, both visual and oral, I recognised from films and times gone by; of the number of homages to things which have peppered not only my film-watching life thus far, but life generally. Present is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart; 'Caddyshack'; George A. Romero; Ennio Morricone; 'Babe'; Willy Nelson and, amongst other things, some film from the 1980's starring Bill Murray about what appear to be four exorcists...The film is, ultimately, a horror film to be enjoyed most by people who, I think, do not especially like horror films; a film whose terror, sense of hopelessness, violence and gore is strangely distilled through a filter of comedy and chaos. It is as if there is someone watching the film with you holding your hand, constantly reminding you that everything will be OK in the end. The burning question is as to whether films such as these (post-modern rollercoasters of jokes and references to the bulwark of the last 50 years of mainstream entertainment, which just happens to be a generic zombie virus infestation flick at the same time) are at all good for cinema. In my opinion, they are not.Jesse Eisenberg plays a nerdy, sexually frustrated loner who's studying at a university in Texas and who, through his complete lack of a social life and difficulties with his extended family, misses out entirely on the zombie apocalypse. Mortified, in his own unique way, upon discovering the end of the world, and coming to observe a strict set of survival rules, he takes it on himself to travel back to Ohio to see if anything remains of his family and hometown. This, he surmises, will be enough to win his parents' respect should they still be alive, who looked down on him for not yet acquiring a girlfriend. Along the way, complications arise in the form of a cocksure cowboy played by Woody Harrelson - somebody whose approach is very different to Eisenberg's and who is desperate, besides everything else, to get his hands on a Twinkie. They are later joined by a pair of con-artist played by Emma Stone and her twelve year old sister, played by Abigail Breslin. Stone forces her sister to live to a similarly strict set of regulations, that they should trust no one and assume that, from now on, it is just the two of them against the world. The road trip makes for a mostly uninteresting, although occasionally funny, adventure which mutates into a romance between the Eisenberg and Stone characters and their being forced into revising predetermined outlooks on other people and the world around them. The film is not, however, kept on enough of a leash for it to really be particularly special. A sense of desperation is lacking. Many films tackling this premise, from 'Night of the Living Dead' and '28 Days Later' to 'The Road' and 'Shaun of the Dead', are afforded degrees of chaos and disorder as civilisation has been destroyed and characters in the film are relegated to making it up as they go along. But 'Zombieland' lacks peril, and it distils the horror of its characters' predicament through the brashness of Harrelson's character who doesn't appear frightened of anything. If he isn't scared, why should WE be? The shallowness of most of it is exposed near the midway point when, upon learning of his hometown's annihilation, Eisenberg's void existence in the universe is filled by his making it his quest to bed Emma Stone's character. The film, you will have no doubt worked out, and despite providing its characters with a Tarkovsky-esque palette upon which to contemplate the meaning of life and man's place in the universe as they live through the apocalypse, is not especially deep...Eventually, director Ruben Fleischer forces his leads to mutate, not into the un-dead, but certainly into people more reminiscent of human-beings and less shut off from stringent habits. A hermit and a loner at university, Eisenberg learns lessons about opening up to others and being more sociable, while Stone realises that there might be more to this post-apocalyptic world than merely thieving from other people and condensing the rest of the wild world to her and her sister. Irrespective, the character narrative is heavy-going and simplistic - the film is more interested in flashes of popular culture; zombie-gore and a particularly bizarre sequence whereby everyone holes up in a Los Angeles mansion for absolutely no reason whatsoever other than for the fact it belongs to whom it does.In its barest form, the film is a kinetic series of colourful splatter sequences enabling the meek Jesse Eisenberg and the self-assured Woody Harrelson to smash up a number of zombies in a variety of different ways. Most audiences have taken to this, but two or three haven't - one critic reaches the firm conclusion that the film has one goal: '...to entertain the pants off of you!' and recommends the film, whereas another deduces a similar train of thought in dismissing it as '...an okay DVD rental choice but (nothing) beyond that' and gives it a lower rating. It would be wrong to label the film in any way dull, but it is certainly lacking in substance to back up its ultra-assertive style.",5,1,2,7 March 2018
A Beautiful Mind," Beautifully shot, made, acted and put across - a real gem of a film.
","Yes, it's probably been said a million times by a million different people in a million different reviews but A Beautiful Mind really is a beautiful film. The film is smart, engaging and entertaining in its own way  even the fact it's based on a real person and loosely on a true story is even more fascinating. A Beautiful Mind is really just a life story but what a life. Dealing with mathematician John Nash (who I admit hadn't heard of before) and his life of genius and love as well as the more darker sides of his life or that of mental illness is a joy to behold and it's done in such a way that it engages the viewer, putting them there with Nash (Crowe) the whole way through.What I really liked about A Beautiful Mind is its intelligence. The film gets straight into business as Nash starts university in 1940s America; this is where we learn the most about him although half the information we're given we're not even aware of its importance. We see that Nash is, in truth, a genius but we also see a more unnatural side to his persona. His first friendship is with a roommate called Charles (Bettany) who I noticed is pretty much the exact opposite in terms of kind of person to that of Nash. He didn't entirely fit in with his other co-students outside and thus doesn't fit in yet this 'jock' mysteriously takes to him from the off. Clever and confusing film-making that pays off later on.Nash's and Charles' exchanges are often kept to settings where only the two of them are in immediate vicinity  the film further attempts to play with us when Charles' niece is introduced; furthering the character of Charles and further playing tricks on us for reasons that become revealed. Nash also develops throughout this segment as the 40s turn into the 50s. In all honesty, I became very suspicious of Charles the more of a friend he became and it's no coincidence that the more we see Nash doing what it is he does; the more we are tempted to label him a 'crazy' more so than 'genius'. This is due to the fact he's seen doing some pretty erratic things like multiple complex sums, tearing out magazine articles and basically trying to crack a code that isn't there. Once again, fantastic film-making  dragging you in and playing with you.Another interesting aspect of the film is it's espionage theme. This creates conflict in the film, giving Nash a reason to do the things he does  One small thing can trigger off several large things in Nash's mind. This is evident when he visits the pentagon to crack a code yet becomes so involved in it all that another character named Parcher (Harris) becomes involved in his life. Arguably, the scenes involving Parhcer and the results of Nash's actions because of Parcher often make for the film's best and most gripping bits not to mention that they enable the film to drop its most evident clues yet regarding the truth. A further example of a small, seemingly insignificant item causing chaos is when Nash spots the word 'Soviet' in a newspaper and his illness flairs up again. These espionage scenes create the conflict as the domestic issues intensify.A Beautiful Mind is a very powerful and well made film that just seems to feel like something Nash's life centres around: a mathematics puzzle. It's not one of those Mullholland Drive sort of visual jigsaw puzzle type films but it has the right balance of good character development, strong acting performances and intelligence that allows it to drop clues as to what might happen later.",8,0,3,15 August 2007
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A Tasteless, over the top $110,000,000 Tom and Jerry episode between the only two people on the planet you'd pay to see running on a non-existent story and script.
","Mr. & Mrs. Smith is a film that can sum up perfectly what's wrong with not only American cinema but star power and utilising (or taking advantage of) it. Here, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as two people, married and yet have been able to keep one secret from one another: they are both international assassins for hire. Lots of things don't add up in this film resulting in it being a horrid and un-engaging film that I could only minutely recommend for perhaps having one or two decent chase sequences or action scenes.The mentioning of 'star power' is relevant because even I could've starred as Mr. Smith in this film and someone picked off the street could've starred as Mrs. Smith but Pitt and Jolie get people into the cinema, I guess. Secondly, this is the reason American cinema is where it is with lots of dumb action and fast edits being the hook to drag everyone in: ironically enough, I saw this on November the 11th which is remembrance day here in Britain and what kind of film did I get to see that Sunday night? A network premiere of two people armed to the teeth with guns and explosives; jumping around and shooting the hell out of each other, the house in which they live, moving cars and other bad guys all the time not taking a bullet apart from the time Mrs. Smith hits her husband with a knife accidentally  if only it was as easy as this on D-Day or in the battle of the Somme or during Vietnam or Desert Storm.I have a number of gripes about this film, one of which being the fact the film was made on $110,000,000: what a crock since this could've been made on a lot less, surely. Another gripe is the direction of Doug Liman; a man who delivered an entertaining film called 'Go' several years ago; a film that was clever since it didn't portray homosexuals as Hollywood would normally do; a film that was funny in its dialogue and engaged with its characters and their problems; a film that had three stories going at once  Mr. and Mrs. Smith didn't even HAVE a story; how it must've wished it could've borrowed one from Go. I also don't believe the way they could keep the secret from one another for so long: the film establishes a perfect Suburban American life and cleverly places Mrs. Smith's arsenal in the cooker, a place the typical male might never look therefore the secret's safe.The actual premise for the film seems so clever and original, it can't fail. I can just see the fat cats rubbing their hands: We'll get Pitt and Jolie, sex them up a few times and get them to shoot the crap out of each other and everyone else when we need to as well as a stupid script that the idiots out in contemporary cinema land will love. There are the obligatory love scenes at the beginning; Jolie in a sexy outfit performing her first kill and lots of gung-ho action. The idea behind this film is so very basic that it's not enough to form an actual story. I was confused as to why Mr. and Mrs. Smith couldn't just explain to each other why they were going after the same hit; the fact these two now apparently hate each other and shoot at each other with intent to kill and yet we know that there's no reason for them to do so  we don't even have the pleasure of being led down the path since we already know there's no point of them doing what they're doing. The originality and humour behind these two bullet-proof people shoot each other becomes boring in its delivery after the third time it does so. First time you think: OK, very funny; second time you think: Yeah, you just did that and after that the same thing just keeps on coming and you just don't give a damn, you are begging the film to end. The fun and originality behind the whole idea becomes monotonous.There is still room for me to say that Mr. & Mrs. Smith comes very close to a Charlie's Angels film once the brainless action steps up a gear for the final shootout but you'll have switched off by that time; the way they bicker during the car chase as they manage to flawlessly pick off any chasing enemies is so bad, it's cringe worthy. I read that director Liman was inspired by no less than five films before making this and it shows; it's a little bit of everything you don't want and in my opinion, five films is too many to be inspired by: where's the originality, Doug? Go and The Bourne Identity were good films  what happened? The film should be avoided unless you are literally looking for a two hour no-brainer featuring lots of loud rubbish, technology that hasn't been invented yet and Pitt and Jolie earning their cheques for having silly fun that eventually turned into a proper relationship: what a rip-off.",4,1,5,12 November 2007
The Departed," Agonisingly ordinary, routine little cops and criminals piece which is best described as minor Scorsese.
","The Departed is a curious thing: a Martin Scorsese concept movie. Here's a piece by the renowned director running on a sentence long pitch which reads something like: 'there are these two fellas; one's an undercover cop pretending to work with the mob while the other's a mole employed by the mobsters mixing it with the cops' – there's your pitch, now run with it. I've nothing greatly against The Departed; it's a serviceable and workable enough little thriller which darts along at a merry old pace but it is an oddly cold; oddly distant; unmoving and strangely uninvolving piece, punctuated by individual 'moments' or 'bits' that take what has been a flagging film up to the respective point before consequently dragging it through a hedge in the proverbial maze thus onto another path entirely. Where Scorsese has dealt with the gangster genre in spits and spots before, namely Goodfellas and Casino, and done so in a manner that took us right to the brink in terms of either coming to side with the characters or despising them, The Departed chugs along with both its post-'24' and post-Bourne mannerisms as well as droll causality as it runs on a very specific premise plus routine character arcs. Where rather gloriously straddling that line between glamorisation and demonisation in the past, Scorsese has effectively relegated himself to mainstream fluff feigning to be about something whilst running on star power. In short, it is highly underwhelming and staggeringly average.The two primary players of the film are Leonardo DiCaprio's Billy Costigan, a Boston police academy graduate hired by Martin Sheen's top police captain Oliver Queenan to go undercover for the department so as to spy on mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson); and Matt Damon's Colin Sullivan, another police academy graduate this time groomed by said mob boss from a very early age to go through the system and work on the inside of the police force for the crooks. Around this nifty little premise Scorsese effectively proves he can structure a few tense set pieces and create a tone of uncertainty and paranoia, predominantly from Costigan's perspective which is further aided by DiCaprio's performance of a man suffering certain emotions thus rousing the material at specific points. Little in the way of the duality they share is explored. Each men play roles within roles; both men are on the wrong side of a verbal battering from Mark Wahlberg's Staff Sergeant named Sean Dignam, Dicaprio more-so because we need the entire back-story of his life up to this point spelled out to us so as to know whom we're dealing with; and both men come to form relationships with Vera Farmiga's police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden.For large chunks of the film, we don't get it; we don't understand. People charge and dart all over the screen going through what the overly complicated, under nourishing narrative demands of them; a similar sense of 'going through the motions' equally as apparent on the other side of the camera in Scorsese's directing. The plight of Costigan, this angry young man with parents whom are deceased and from a very limited background, and his inauguration into Costello's gang so that he may effectively risk even more by branching out into more serious things, is workmanlike; competent and quite taut. Costigan appears smart, too smart and has nothing to loose. As one individual recognises early on: 'you can't trust a man with nothing to loose'. Costigan's faux-boss in Costello, with his womanising attributes; casual cocaine use and analogies to bodily excretion embedded within his threats, is rightfully piggish and carries all the necessary traits required for us to accordingly despise him, although is played like a cartoon character and is difficult to take seriously. Costello's aid is a gangster named Mr. French, played by he-of-a-wavering-accent Ray Winstone; Winstone does his thing, a mixture of what he's done before in things like Nil by Mouth and what-have-you, and does it in his sleep.The film uneasily cuts back and forth from DiCaprio and Damon, Damon of whom runs on a strand that isn't interesting and, dare I say, doesn't seem particularly necessary. Damon's cold, robotic expression throughout the film echoes the physical detachment we have from the film itself; when a time comes much later on for him to actually react to a quite incredible scenario, given the context, he has overseen - the sequence feels more grandeur and more incredible than it actually is because he's being asked to react to something; he's being asked to do something. Most of the dialogue in the film exists to advance whatever proceedings are required to move us all along; vacant are genuinely chilling moments of eerie realty, the likes of which might echo Travis Bickle's scociopathic monologue practises or long pauses on Jake LaMotta as he inhabits a locale, heaving and breathing - bordering on a fit of rage.The sheer simplicity of it all is highlighted during one scene in which some of Costello's lesser goons stand around the entrance to a place of business randomly accusing passers by of being undercover, or 'rats' – one of whom, in a jovial manner, is Di Caprio's character. The sequence is inter-cut with Damon's Sullivan sitting competently at a desk and computer frantically trying to run through whom of Costello's men might be untrustworthy, highlighting just how thoroughly more skilled one man is compared to many - yes, we gathered this ninety minutes ago. The Departed is scatty and detached, it's an alienating and frustrating film book-ended by individual bits and pieces that resonate; but if there's a reason they do, it's because droll story-telling is being momentarily interrupted by a moment which just 'happens', not because the film itself is especially engaging. Where many have lauded it and where The Academy itself buckled into rewarding Scorsese with the ultimate, it was merely dry and limp.",6,1,2,23 December 2010
Die Hard," Tough and resilient, like its lead; the sort of smart and grounded American action/adventure film that the current filmic climate is devoid of.
","People bicker, argue and disagree with one another in Die Hard like nobody's business: the police with the police; the police with the F.B.I.; the F.B.I. with local power company employees; the terrorists with each another; one hostage is rightly reluctant for another to make his presence known, and yet at the heart of it is the action lead in lieutenant John McLane's calm and methodical relationship over a two-way radio with a certain police officer named Al Powell. Amidst all the chaos and panic, two guys, one of whom is on the front line, are keeping their cool and we connect with them intricately on that very basic level as this masterful piece of work weaves down chaotic and anger-filled routes.Die Hard might very well be the greatest action film of all time, the best of its genre; a chess match in a three or so dozen storey tall building in which cat and mouse and all things substantial linked to revising what traits it is the action film 'ought' to resemble are played out. The sequence in which its revisionist tendencies reach somewhat of a peak is the instance that sees its rugged lead leap off the roof of said building with a fire-hose tied around his waist, just after saying a little prayer. The lead could plunge to his death; he presence is not as required to drive the film as much as it was required earlier on – the police have arrived and settling down into a groove of exchanges and gun battles with the enemies within as a war is waged and could feasibly just play out. McLane is superfluous to proceedings, save a sub-plot that opens up to do with his wife which might be foiled by anyone of a righteous nature in the film.It's a superb set piece, dramatic and enthralling in its systematic execution of taking into account McLane's own personal safety with the F.B.I. chopper buzzing overhead with an old fashioned 'race against time' premise to proceedings as those with the power eventually agree to set off a number of explosives located in the vicinity. There is heart, peril and raw fear in McLane's voice and actions; items not synonymous with action film leads. The film of course covers the exploits of Bruce Willis' lieutenant McLane, a New York policeman that touches down in L.A. at Christmas time in order to meet with his wife with whom he has a strenuous relationship. The emphasis on McLane as someone out of his depth is playfully toyed with early on, his observing of erratic-to-him behaviour at the airport as a woman leaps into the arms of newly arrived boyfriend spawns a murmured expletive followed by 'California(!)', as does an incidence later on when a drunk male party guest kisses McLane on the cheek. We feel McLane is out of his depth, he trudges through the reception area of the building to a low angle capturing the power the place will eventually come to have over him as his footsteps echo eerily throughout the foyer.His wife is Holly (Bedelia), a strong woman; who's better off in life than her husband with a great job plus prospects in a field usually dominated by the male and more than a match for the terrorists at various times whom have seized control. You may ultimately read into the film as a 'test' for McLane to win Holly back as a marital partner: the symbolic releasing of a gold watch, which was a gift earlier on from a potentially new suitor, during the climax is the ultimate act that wins through in the end and confirms a succession of McLane's goals. The leader of the terrorists that take over the building during a Christmas party is Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber, a man it's established has loved the idea of painstaking process in the meticulous detailing of something from a very early age - it appears he's taken great care in manufacturing the robbery of the high-rise. His first lieutenant is Karl (Godunov), who it's established is himself an unhinged individual when he risks his own life early on by sawing through some electrical pylons as his brother below struggles to cut the correct wires in time. The cat and mouse exchanges between Karl and John for the first twenty or so minutes are dramatically involving; wonderfully constructed and thrilling as special attention to the skyscraper as a space complete with its own tunnels and corridors is observed.Die Hard's attitudes to the action genre in terms of conflict is highlighted in two sequences, the first being that McLane is quick to avoid conflict; evading and even stopping mid sentence whilst on the two-way so as to check his surroundings to make sure it's safe. Incidentally, he uses his firearm to shoot off locks; break windows so as to enter; 'frighten' hostages into moving to a safer zone and to stop a large fan from rotating so he may pass. The gun is rendered a tool during these sequences, not a mere item used to shoot, blow stuff up and advance action. The second is when the police initially establish themselves outside and charge in on first sight, in what is an event more typically associated in furthering action and conflict and the sort of sequence a lesser film of the genre would solely rely on. The film is aware of this; having its lead, himself embodying many antithetical traits to the typical action lead, comment on proceedings by labelling them 'macho a**holes'. Their efficient and brutal demise is systematic of the film's overall attitudes to its genre and these actions. There are barely more than a few seconds in Die Hard that don't work, the sort of high octane American feature film you rarely get nowadays in a world flooded with genre hybridising; big budgeted flops; daft star systems; merchandising and the incessant need to leave room for sequels. How unfortunate.",10,2,3,17 May 2010
Psycho," The horror and the terror combining on a broad canvas of genre manipulation; psychoanalysis and deconstruction of an archetype in what most say is Hitchcock's best.
","Similarly to a lot of films from decades-past, nothing anybody here, or anywhere else, says about certain films will alter their status as ground breaking, or influential in certain aspects, pieces of cinema. Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is one of those such films, a film that put paid to an entire era and mindset in American cinema; a film that defied grammar and construction and went all out in its deconstruction of both genre and issues of censorship. A film made by a man usually uttered within the same breath as both Kubrick and Welles when it comes to the film-makers that shaped cinema in its first full century as an existing medium. Most will say Psycho is Hitchcock at his best, and you'd be hard pressed to disagree with them.Essentially, Psycho is a film that covers a fair degree of psychoanalysis going on within a close knit locale. The majority of the film is dominated by a certain Norman Bates (Perkins), a young man whose mother still has a grip on him as he attempts to live whatever pitiful existence he has. Bates will predominantly inhabit one of either two spaces, briefly breaking off to inhabit a rural, swamp locale for the dumping of a car. The predominant two are a cabin, complete with motel rooms and an office as well as his house on the hill which he 'shares' with his mother. Something that Hitchcock does to a very basic level with these seemingly innocent, everyday locations is turn them into spaces of the 'uncanny' variety. That is to say, at a time when Hollywood's studio system permitted definitive genres to be shot on certain sets well suited to the genre film being made, (a mad scientist's laboratory for horror or the inside of a space ship for a sci-fi) Hitchcock manipulates offices and houses and other such 'spaces' and turns them on their heads for what the locations initially demand you produce there.But the toying with the genre isn't limited to just this. The set up involves a certain Marion Crane (Leigh) and the theft of a large amount of money from her boss. What is set up as a road movie, in which we might assume chase to be the primary narrative drive, turns into something completely different. Initially, the film is driven by a woman. Marion is presented in a less than flattering light, established at the very beginning when it appears she has spent the entirety of her lunch break with another man out of wedlock. Following this is the theft and the complete disregard for authority and her own safety when it transpires she sleeps in her car and very quickly tries to get rid of a police officer when he questions her.For this passage of film, Psycho relies on its suspense revolving around whether Marion will be caught as would-be lines of dialogue are exchanged within Marion's mind to do with what her peers are debating back at her work. What we assume will be a (routine?) chase film-come-thriller as her boss strives to get his money back will become something else entirely, aptly marked at a certain point in the film in which special attention is given to the removing of the money from the piece. Following this, a new plot drive, indeed protagonist, takes over the reigns of the film and it branches out into a different beast.I suppose we are meant to consider Psycho a horror piece, despite it starting off as a thriller told from the guilty's perspective as essence of chase looms in the background. Later on, following the famous shower scene, tides will turn and what essentially remains a detective story is told from a killer's perspective. The film places the audience within the world of a murderer and we begin to see that world through the eyes of this character, something that occurs perhaps slightly out of turn when Norman spies on Marion getting undressed in her motel room by the office. It is a signifying of power; a placing the audience into a position of power that they are forced to share with Norman, whom, at the time, probably just comes across as a little eccentric. Later on, however, the audience are completely roped in and must share the stress with Norman. A clever move on Hitchcock's behalf is in the form of private detective Milton Arbogast (Balsam), who badgers poor Norman at the motel reception about recent visitors. Norman squirms and, as an audience, we may have an immediate reaction of not wanting Norman to get caught out. But should we be feeling these emotions given who he is and what he did? If Psycho achieves anything, it is the manipulation of genre and film language, but it is additionally the breaking down of a character archetype. For the film to spend time with Norman, a seemingly normal human being, as this 'monster' inhabiting a horror film, is extraordinary. There is nothing initially uncanny about Norman and he is a far cry from previous horror genre 'monsters' in the form of anything Universal had to offer at the time. But the film retains a spooky and unnerving atmosphere, punctuated by set pieces involving the aforementioned Arbogast, in a memorable scene on some stairs; but also right towards the end when normal, everyday individuals move in on Bates' house to uncover the truth, in what is a sequence that is still rather frightening. Psycho is somewhat of a towering achievement, and the fact an individual produced this sort of a film yet still managed to cause debate as to whether it's his out-and-out best work, is arguably the most incredible thing about the Psycho.",8,0,0,21 May 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Tormenting and agonising in all the right ways, Polanski's chiller about a woman's forlorn descent into grim territory makes for slow burning, strained viewing.
","Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is imbued with this underpinning sense of terror; this sense of dread or horror at what 'might' be, it is a remarkably well played horror/thriller near faultlessly encompassing both the natural and the supernatural within one realm of a world but always playing everything straight-faced and in a gruesomely suggestive way. The text is a pure and unadulterated piece, so much so that it is living proof that precisely why it is that keeping everything in suspense and refraining from necessarily showing your contents in all its inglory is a million times more effective than full on, bloody horror violence and petty 'jumps' along the way to an obligatory genre denouement. The film's top trump might very well be in the way its director flawlessly maintains that balance much later on in the film by the time certain reveals and revelations have unfolded; in a lesser film the foreplay and suggestion prior to the shocking disclosure might very well have been the film's substantial core, but instead of wilting for a final act of frills-and-spills of whatever nature, Rosemary's Baby arguably pushes on from its provocative routes and steps up a gear into more agonising territory, in what is rather-an impressive demonstration of construction and tempo to a film of this ilk. The film is a quite engrossing drama, a film teasing and bedeviling the audience with two realities, one of which would lead one to assume it is a gritty, urban and somewhat everyday drama set in New York City about a woman slowly loosing her mind as she balances the moving into a new apartment; the pressures with some neighbours she comes to be wary of and the desiring of motherhood which leads onto pregnancy. Is it the bustle of the city driving her mad, or is there something seedier going on; something more broadly linked to things of a more unworldly nature unfolding within this very worldly zone. The film begins with the Woodhouse's searching out a new abode within which to live, with the aim to turn their family of two into a family of three. The Woodhouse's are made up of the titular Rosemary, played by Mia Farrow, and her husband Guy (Cassavetes); people with the ability to, we feel, afford the high-life given the exquisite nature of the apartment they are shown around: a porter in the elevator complimenting the Beethoven music playing somewhere within the complex once inside the apartment proper and the generally rich nature of the interior furnishing. But we are all informed of some prior nastiness that once happened in the apartment and a wardrobe seemingly blocking something to great convenience offers slight distrust.There is a moment, eventually doubling up for the catalyst of what later transpires, in which Rosemary will admit to those listening of a terrifying dream she had; a dream in which she was situated on a dock wearing next to nothing as a ship about to set off on a doomed cruise sat perched awaiting boarding just ahead of her. The notion of feeling bare or vulnerable whilst situated at a locale upon which the beginnings of what are usually long, arduous journeys appearing prominent; the ship itself appearing metaphorically as the literal apartment purchase, those of whom are allowed on linked directly to class and those within a class able to afford to move into such spaces – the underlying factor being that what lies ahead on this cruise or journey is mandatory trouble and strife, the precise things which plague Rosemary's life once she has gotten herself into this true-to-life nightmare. Ploanski allows for things to brood before hitting us with any counter punches he mostly certainly has up his sleeve; a young girl named Terry bonds well with Rosemary, but this is not a character study between two girls and the quaint friendship they strike up; the Castevet family neighbours named Roman (Blackmer) and Minnie (Gordon) come to infiltrate the lives of Rosemary and Guy, much to Rosemary's disdain; but this isn't necessarily a character drama about numerous people whom live and integrate with one another in a jolly fashion on grounded terms within a mere New York apartment block. The film allows for raw human behaviour, Guy's attitudes and reactions to the Castevet's presence or demands shifting naturally enough without bringing to awares any seedier side to the agreements he's actually striking up with them, the likes of which subsequent viewings might reveal more clearly, as intense or obvious underhanded tactics. By the time Rosemary's titular baby has been conceived and is known to be on the way, natural human behaviour is captured as somewhat unnatural, or at least made so that the audience might be drawn towards assuming it to be unnatural – cravings for specific foods; immense weight loss; pains and paranoia each straddling a fine line between what might be uneasily typical or just disturbingly atypical behaviour going on to contribute to a nastier cause. Polanksi keeps the tension, terror and paranoia wrenched up to some near-unbearable levels; the fact that certain people around Rosemary, whom she's known for varying degrees of time and most of whom come into contact with the Castevet's, appear to come to sticky ends is a predominant item; the working out of various clues and the shifting of different notions into place occupying most of the film's somewhat agonising crucible. The end result is a superior thriller revolving around the potentially distressing, but with the underlying source of terror being the fear of one's accuracy in seeing through such matters and where that would then place them; culminating in a distinguished piece.",7,0,1,31 March 2011
The Holiday," Well written and well made romance film that although sometimes forces its humour, definitely holds out.
","Despite being another 'rom-com', I got the feeling The Holiday didn't need to go down such a route in order to prove itself. It's a typical, all star cast, character relations drama that relies on easy humour thanks mainly to the fact Jack Black is in it but also allows a group of four characters in two different countries to bond in a satisfactory and sometimes meaningful manner. What The Holiday does to try and draw you in is that it sets up two women called Amanda (Diaz) and Iris (Winslet) in two very different situations. One is just coming out of a relationship after their boyfriend Ethan (An unfortunately underused Edward Burns) had an affair with his secretary and the other is coming to terms with a long time love, who never quite returned the same feelings, that is getting married - one woman is American and the other is British; so this gives at least the ladies of the audience two people to latch onto and relate to; pick your situation that you might have found yourself in and let it enthral you. For me, I related to Iris more but for reasons more to do with the fact I found her to be far more tolerable than Amanda.Regarding what I said in the opening paragraph, I feel the film didn't need to use some of the humour it did. I respect the fact that Amanda is working in the film trailer business but to have her life's situation narrated to her and more frustratingly; to us, on more than one occasion was tiresome and just stuck out in what was otherwise quite a charming and funny film. Twinned with this, most of the humour that revolved around Amanda wasn't that good and just felt gimmicky. These also include things like the whole 'trying to cry' scenario and the 'funny' online conversation she has with Iris, especially the way she gushes at the fact there are 'zilch' men in and around the area she lives yet contradicts herself a few hours into the visit. Onto the men of the film and Jude Law's Graham and Jack Black's Miles provide the intended laughs and love interest. Needless to say; both do well as both are so different when compared to one another and of course since we know them as actors, both have done very different films in the past to one another. Graham's introduction comes first and basically consists of him stumbling into a male wet dream. He knocks on the door expecting to see his sister let him stay the night after some heavy drinking but instead finds a blonde American woman who asks him to bed within about five minutes. So there he is: in a remote English cottage with heavy snowfall outside and all around him whilst a girl he barely knows comes onto him  although a complete contradiction of what we thought Amanda's character was, it still acted as a humorous introduction to Graham's character and he handled the situation well.What scrap of extreme credibility The Holiday does have comes in the form of Arthur; played by Eli Wallach, an old film writer from the classical Hollywood period. He not only acts as the anchor in terms of respectability but also manages to analyse the film as it happens. 'You're the star', he tells Iris regarding her lost love situation and I had to agree since Amanda was becoming too much of a cartoon. Each woman's story is cut back and forth to in a very pleasing and satisfying manner, not to mention well paced as certain events and twists become apparent. Iris' friendship with Arthur and Miles' own heartache as even they grow closer works well since we are lead to care for these people prior to the final third through good film-making. Even tiny things such as the scene involving Amanda, Graham and the 'other person at Graham's house' work well and are highly effective since it's near the end and we care.Although not normally one to recommend nor commend films like this, I found The Holiday rather enjoyable even if it had a few things I didn't like but it's possible to ignore these things as other themes and conventions work with other character to create something much more memorable.",7,2,3,9 August 2007
Crazy Heart," We've been here before, but I cannot find fault with the journeying back if it means experiencing something like Crazy Heart; a toe-tapping, handsomely made character drama.
","I noted that 2006 French film The Singer was a lot like Aronofsky's 2009 film The Wrestler; a man with a rich history within a particular field, now apparently relegated to clinging on to his profession as well as livelihood as everything else around him appears to just descend into chaos and strife. This, as relationships with those around him appeared to strike up just as much as physical and mental well-being appeared to deteriorate in equal measure. Crazy Heart, the really rather accomplished debut film from American Scott Cooper – a man more commonly associated with support acting, completes a retrospective triangle or trilogy of error in this regard; producing a film feeding off of The Wrestler's success which in turn owed a great debt to The Singer which in turn, Crazy Heart feels somewhat similar to. The immense positives you take out of it are that in the lead role, a certain Jeff Bridges tears through the material in a fashion that makes it watchable all the way through despite prior exposure to this sort of material, and in a similar vein, director Cooper's competence in his ability to sear through the framework and the general subject matter as if he's been directing for most of his life, made particularly impressive given his background and (lack of) previous experience within this field.The film's lead, a burning out and close to all but washed up country singer I read Cooper told his lead was essentially 'the fifth Highwayman', is a certain Otis 'Bad' Blake; a man with former glories and a rich history of singing and song writing many of whom know of. When we first encounter him, it's in the present day and we see him driving a fair old distance so as to arrive at a local bowling alley complex to do a performing of all the old favourites to an eager crowd. His arrival sees his name in the largest font possible upon the advertising hoarding towering over the complex and car park, but the fact that 'winter leagues are forming' gets the top billing is a sure sign of the sorts of odd-jobs he appears to be getting by on nowadays. Inside, the manager greets him eagerly and enthusiastically; a great admirer, while later on a similarly aged store clerk does the same, as does a younger member of a backing group whom was always very fond of his guitar work – the generational link here of people of most ages having heard of Blake establishing a popularity it seems he had amongst many. The alley owner offers free meals and bowling, the item of drink on the other hand is somewhat taboo; a disagreement after prior niceties a blot on the communication and settles something on the back-burner.As a character, Blake appears every bit as off the cusp and spontaneous as his 'bad' tag would suggest; after previously informing the store patron he would perform what is his favourite song for him and his wife at the evening's concert, Blake stumbles off stage after gearing up the backing group and is promptly sick in a trash can outside; this, before ambling back on stage to pick up the song's proverbial pieces and play it all out. The man and his wife, for whom it was requested, do not seem necessarily offended nor bothered by something so personal and something so rare in its overall happening to be affected in this way, Blake being what he is and everything that comes with it; a later instance somewhere else in which he hops off stage to do a sudden dance with a local woman in the crowd very much embedding an impromptu persona. Unlike Xavier Giannoli's The Singer, there is no distinction between on and off stage persona as Depardieu's lead sung romantic ballads for couples over 60 but occupied grimy, smoky dressing rooms back stage; Blake is this ferocious, sweaty, scatty, wacky, grizzled man on and away from the limelight and everybody appears to love him all the more for it.The crux of the film is a romantic entanglement with Maggie Gyllenhaal's Jean Craddock, a reporter local to the South West in which Blake performed his first gig of the film. Like Blake, she is sceptic of relationships and commitment but has an apparent deeply routed affection for country music; both parties have had failed marriages and watching their bond slowly unravel with all this in mind is rather affecting, Cooper's attention to characterisation frank and upfront without ever pretending to be anything of more immense depth than that of what it is. The bond additionally allows Blake to undergo a process more directly linked to that of his failure in the role of a father, when Craddock's infant son named Buddy sees Blake given the chance to bond with an infant boy in the reverse manner he did so to his distanced and outcast own.The film additionally explores his newfound sense of ability to write music again, when Colin Farrell's younger and more youth orientated country singer named Tommy Sweet with whom Blake shares a shadowy past despite intensely mentoring him years ago. We go on to cover Blake's life following the introducing of Craddock to proceedings, a verbal confirmation by doctors that our lead is on a one way path to ruin due to the alcohol consumption we've come to already realise was doing him little in the way of favours and his persistent chain smoking highlighting what it is he has to battle; with Craddock and her son manifestations of what it is he has to loose after previously having very little to fight for. On top of its core studies and general characterisation, Crazy Heart impressively welds in all its other content to form an adept and consummate piece which balances grizzled, dishevelled tones with friendlier and bouncier overall feeling; the short-and-large of it resulting in a really watchable piece.",7,1,2,24 March 2011
War of the Worlds," Delivers several quick punches rather than one, more drawn out experience but the hits hit the mark
","If War of the Worlds proves anything, it is that Steven Spielberg knows how to master the situation of placing ordinary and innocent characters into a scenario of great, fantastical nature and allowing things and events to play out in a rapid and exciting manner. This is the sort of film that is chalk and cheese for Spielberg, something he mastered in films like Jurassic Park where innocents in the form of children and every-day people were placed into a predicament they could not possibly comprehend they'd ever face (that event being hunted by dinosaurs). He also did it on a much, much larger scale in Saving Private Ryan where American troops were in Europe; were alienated and pushed to extreme measures after questioning with one another the very reason several of them were being risked for one.Like those two films, War of the Worlds gives us three things: firstly an expansive and inescapable canvas on which to allow the adventure to play out. Secondly, unspectacular characters dropped into a predicament that forces them to become somewhat spectacular even if it is to merely survive. And thirdly, an enemy that is either mysterious or unseen for most of the time but most certainly hostile and one that the protagonists will have a hard time fighting since they are either hopelessly outnumbered or outgunned. War of the Worlds is hardly a crowning achievement but for Spielberg, it's the sort of film he relishes making  the sort of film that does not need advanced characters or a stupendous story but has enough within the premise to etch two or three dramatic scenes out of.In terms of extra-terrestrials, the Martians in War of the World are certainly the most unfriendly in Spielberg's collection. The idea that they have watched on for centuries immediately establishes some sort of superiority in the sense they must be highly advanced to even see our planet, let alone observe it  and what do we have to show? The Hubble Telescope, is what. So the drive for the antagonism is weak in the sense what it boils down to is mere inter species envy that films like Se7en taught us is not a good thing to be harbouring. Another thing I noticed was that their recall klaxon sounds oddly like the opening two beats of the Halloween III: Season of the Witch theme tune.But rather than a gripping story, War of the Worlds gives us a nice, reliable and somewhat effective cause and effect fuelled passage. On the whole, it works and the film glides effortlessly between locations and situations, all of which revolve around desperation as a group struggle to take a car; the chance arises to hide in a basement and then what to do once down there. The hero, played by Tom Cruise, is Ray Ferrier; a man established to be the sort of person we are not supposed to like what with his outlandish attitude and ignoring of his children. This is a test of survival but looking deeper it is clearly a metaphorical journey for Ray to undertake so that he may prove his worth as a father and as a fatherly figure in times of crisis. There is no coincidence Ray is struggling with a divorce and is established in the manner he is, nor is it by chance he has priority of his kids when the initial incident occurs.So apart from most things including being a damn good ride, War of the Worlds is a journey of survival but also self-discovery and proof that an egotistical American male can balance both his ego and his fatherly figure at once. The film is Independence Day and Mars Attacks! done right; it is both these films with heart and is one that does not rely on the mere visualisation of exploding buildings and destroyed pieces of iconography to get across thrills. War of the Worlds is the sort of film that has a fierce battle going on between tanks and the aliens but refuses to either pan or cut to it and instead remains on Ray and his son go through a short but required conversation about masculinity and 'where one belongs'. For son Robbie (Chatwin) it is the battlefield, for father Ray it is on the run with daughter Rachel (Fanning) acting as the protector.On one hand this is a post-9/11 blockbuster that was made well after 9/11 and the following invasion as the United States struggles to a; come to terms with an attack of this magnitude from the outside and b; cannot seem to finish off the enemy once they are confronted. There are some annoying obligatory scenes and the logic falls apart once or twice towards the end, the disappointing dénouement being one of them, but War of the Worlds' study is all about getting to that point rather than what happens after it's arrived there. Satisfying and tense on one or two occasions, War of the Worlds does make the grade.",6,3,5,14 August 2008
There Will Be Blood," There were Oscars and there will be future viewings.
","To watch There Will Be Blood is to experience There Will Be Blood. Such a film is long, but does not feel like it; such a film is broad in its studies and locales, but never feels like a blockbuster; such a film is highly interesting and demands a lot of attention; but could still be enjoyed even with a sit back and relax attitude. Such a film is There Will Be Blood, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film and recent Academy Award best picture nominee which is set amongst the vast, dusty hills of California at the turn of the Twentieth Century as it becomes apparent one man's work is about to boom.I suppose for a film to predominantly centre around the conflict of interests to do with oil, There Will Be Blood's timing is somewhat significant given what's going on in the Middle East but this never veers too far into the realm of politics. Daniel Plainview, played by the Oscar winning Daniel Day-Lewis, is a man seeking territory and oil for his own profit and his methods of attaining the land and the oil is slippery and ruthless  he's the sort of towering professional that was just born to be a businessman. But there are no daft metaphors directed towards political leaders in this portrayal although the manner in which Plainview delivers his speeches about oil and such to the townsfolk, to me, looked like a President or a world leader delivering a speech to its delegates or citizens.There is nothing really embedded in this film but greatness, and greatness on a grand scale. Similarly to Magnolia of 1999, Anderson has adopted a large canvas on which to decorate his ideas and themes but he has matured as a filmmaker in the sense he does not bite off more than he can chew this time round. If it were worth sitting through the painfully progressive Magnolia just so that I could see There Will Be Blood, then it was worth it. The difference is that Anderson focuses his attention on two to three characters in one setting at a designated point in time which aids the periodic, artistic piece he is trying to create in There Will Be Blood. Needless to say, it works. While Magnolia was all well and good on the surface with the best of intentions (ie; a large scale, 'revolves around nothing', urban drama with interlocking stories), the film fell flat through its lack of conflict and mass-character study.Anderson tones things down here. He tones things down to the point that there is not one word of dialogue in the opening twenty or so minutes  not even when it is a necessity to warn someone of impending doom as a well support crashes down on top of an individual. In the opening, we get an explosion; the audience jumps; an on screen death and not a title card nor a rousing composed score in sight  this is exciting film-making but not of the blockbuster variety. When someone does speak, it is the man of the hour Daniel himself. The character just drips charisma; the sort of individual who could worm his way into a situation, out of the situation and then back into it if he really wanted to. He is told by a young man about certain owned land not too far away and the oil prospects it garners. Daniel ventures there with a young child he has raised as his own after the unfortunate opening events and the film unfolds from here on in.At its centre, There Will Be Blood is a continuous conflict between the broad subject that is religion and one man's business ideas and reaping of the Earth of natural sources for his own personal gain; call it greed, call it business. The one individual that stands in Daniel's way is Eli Sunday (Dano), whose brother Paul (also Dano) gave the Plainview's the notion to go to the plot of land in the first place. Eli is a faith healer, a man of religion and acts as the lone person willing to stand up to Daniel. As a concentrated conflict, the two will exchange blows but not in a fighting sense more-so an egotistical one with feuds in smatterings of mud that do not adopt a violent sense as the fight is too one sided anyway. Daniel's dream and overall target flails and stutters in light of this religious presence, very much 'my church versus your oil rig'. Indeed, when one rig or extractor burns, Eli can only watch on as he gains another point amongst the chaos and burning.The idea that the film at its core is a study of this conflict is emphasised in the final scenes when the two are face to face in a showdown scenario. But leading to this point, the film really works as a stone wall drama. There Will Be Blood is brilliant enough to actually sidestep its primary strand and focus on those around its protagonist, namely Daniel's adopted son H.W. and his antagonism towards Daniel with his deafness and the reason for it preceding this. These scenes work due to the prior hour and a half revolving around Daniel and what a ruthless and somewhat greedy individual he is meaning we cannot help but feel a certain amount towards a now grown up H.W. With stupendous acting and an impressive score as well as wonderful attention to detail, There Will Be Blood is a definite triumph.",8,1,3,28 September 2008
Ice Age," In spite of the title, this is very much a warm film; whether it's one for the ages is another matter, but it's affirming and exciting enough to recommend.
","Ice Age is a three way buddy pic set in the pre-prehistoric era unfolding as a modern day road movie of sorts, in spite of taking place at a time many millennia before roads would even exist; a neat comedy driven by the rocky relationships between a trio of hapless creatures of ancient times gone by running on some good interplay and wily writing as we observe them negate a long, relatively hostile, terrain rife with the elements; sight gags and the fleeting pop culture reference. The film, a sort of two way riff on the likes of Shrek and Monter's Inc., is a workable and often exciting excursion into animation; made more impacting by the real lack of this era in planet Earth's long existence ever really being put to screen, particularly in the animated format. Where Ice Age is nothing above and beyond, it is quaint and timely; its attitude to what it essentially represents never more than evident during a more-dramatic-than-we-expect denouement, something which sees directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha exude an offbeat idea that primitive humans and plentiful mammals may actually co-exist peacefully in this unremitting world of food-chains and strife â€“ it is somewhat nonsensical, and more than fanciful, but you've oddly swayed with it. The film begins with a short skit, within which we observe a small squirrel-like character speaking to us in agonised squeaks and offering us pained reactions to his pratfalls. His unfortunate exploits linked to never quite knowing what to do with a small nut he's managed to get his hands on are what follows, with an attempted burying of it in the snow causing a huge rift in the ground, a rift formulating into a crack and then causing a huge glazier to break off seemingly dooming all the creatures within the realms of this world. Those of whom it will affect the most dwell in the valleys and the forests below this mountainous locale; here, a large but seemingly downcast mammoth named Manfred (Romano) is, in a literal sense, heading counter to the tide as he walks against the mass exodus of animals fleeing this glacier rift and looming ice age. It isn't long until he bumps into Sid, or rather Sid bumps into him; a character who has to be one of the more talkative sloths ever devised and of whom is voiced by John Leguizamo - Sid's scenario seeing him left behind by that of his close family prior to disembarkment: for reasons that become clearer. The dynamic of Sid and Manfred's relationship feeds off the animated film of 2001 of equally good value in Shrek; specifically, Eddie Murphy's Donkey character literally running into that of the hulking titular lead following a mix up with those out to get at him: the nature of their later bond a clear riff on the said pairing in their 'little-and-large' double act plus easily wound up nature clashing with the smaller element of the pairing's talkative nature. Away from these proceedings lie a pack of sabre tooth tigers led by that of Soto (Visnjic), who employs the services of one of his more competent aides, Diego (Leary), to swipe an infant from a camp of early-human Neanderthals amidst the chaos of a surprise attack; early-human Neanderthals of whom look suspiciously drawn from 1995's Pocahontas and its respective homo-sapiens. Soto has preordained this attack out of spite for the mass slaughters implemented upon the tiger clan that have transpired at the discretion of the Neanderthals. The tigers, with their predominantly Hispanic sounding Christian names and evident subscription to gang culture, allude to a greater extent of misrepresentation, but a misrepresentation of which isn't prominent enough to sag the film into a messy trough of any kind. Indeed, Soto puts it very clearly to the rest of us that it is a guided idea born out of a desire for retribution; a veering of the characters away from stock villainy sort and perhaps doing well to draw the more younger members of the targeted audience into identifying the politics of the two sides before having them take their own stance. The raid is a success but Diego looses the baby down a nearby river, only for it to end up in the laps of Manfred and Sid further on down the stretch of water; Diego's angling for it back clashing with Manfred's ignorance out of Diego's true intent as he strives to return it to the humans. Principally, the duality in Manfred and Diego's attitudes towards the primitive humans in regards to specific tragedies that have come to affect either their lives or existences is what's at the forefront here; later revelations linked to Manfred reveal certain truths that do not do enough to sway him onto the ill-guided tract of blood-lust and destruction that drove Diego pre-crucible. What unfolds is an often exciting, albeit reasonably routine, adventure film about these grossly differing animals connecting and repelling at various stages, with a neat framework concluding with quaint epiphanies we do not necessarily have much of a problem with no matter how channelled they may be. The film has fun with that post modern approach to animation contemporary American animations usually feed off, a tract reading something along the lines of 'real life in a world not entirely true to life'; the stopping for a mock-level crossing occurring shortly after we're made aware of the trio's travelling ought to resemble a holidaying family separate examples of this. We enjoy the film's sense of adventure, its grandiose feel in spite of it being a little over 80-odd minutes in length, as well as its core politic pitched solely towards its target demographic that teamwork persistently wins out in the end, and that when prejudices and such are put aside, things can more often than not come off for the much better.",6,0,0,17 September 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," This is one cuckoo's nest you're going to want to take the time to visit.
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is not just a good film for fun and entertainment; for people watching it for its funny script and great Nicholson performance, but it's also a great film as it contains numerous clever conventions and tricks that really help you zone in on the situation and ultimately, put you there in the film with everyone else.Although set in a mental institution, I never really got the feeling the bulk of these people were, indeed, 'crazy'. The group that we are presented with seemed fine, just a little socially inept perhaps apart from the character of Martini (De Vito) whom was a little odd. I first had this suspicion when I saw them all playing cards with one another to reasonable success although McMurphy's (Nicholson) expertise in card playing later on only emphasises the incorrectness from earlier on. Martini's so pleased to be finally playing cards correctly that he just keeps exclaiming: hit me, hit me, hit me. This idea of having a comic and often dramatic film set inside one of these places makes for pure gold.This brings me onto the character of McMurphy. Obviously the audience watching this film aren't as crazy and (hopefully) aren't as socially inept as the characters we focus on in this film so that means we're going to relate to him the most as he's the most like us although some may swerve more to Billy (Dourif). Although brilliantly acted by Nicholson, he is further emphasised through the fact he's not wearing plain white like the rest of the inmates, meaning he stands out. McMurphy's reactions to what was going on, especially during the group therapy sessions, also stood out as they were pretty much my reactions also! I was smirking and looking confused at what was happening; McMurphy even gets restless with these people, something we all would feel after a while in that situation.Also, watching McMurphy's relationship and friendship build up with the character of the Chief (Sampson) is just as fun as it is fascinating. There's this huge, native American who's supposedly dumb and deaf yet McMurphy gives him all the time in the world to try and develop him. The basketball game scene is particularly memorable in its hilarity and the way in which it shows Chief engaging and succeeding in what it is he's been told to do. Remember: we think he's dumb and deaf.Another piece of clever film-making is the Chief himself. In a way, I think the Chief is perhaps supposed to represent the audience in the sense that if the audience was a character, they'd be the Chief. He doesn't talk or do much (similar to what an audience does when they watch a film), he helps McMurphy out when he gets involved in a fight with a guard (Whilst I was watching, was praying someone intervened and it just happened to be Chief) and we even see things from his point of view (the only time it happens in the film) as McMurphy winks at him to show he's OK. So this is very much putting the audience in the film as one of the characters; of course this is played with later on when certain things are revealed and regarding whether or not people escape: I find it very symbolic who does and who doesn't.In conclusion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is just one of those films that is funny, engaging, entertaining and is actually a very smart film considering what I think it does regarding all the characters and everything. This twinned with the character of Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) who I stress isn't so much as evil as she is doing her job, still looms every now and again threatening privileges. I am not surprised this film won so many Oscar's as it would still do today  a great and very memorable film.",9,1,2,7 August 2007
Downfall," Well past the end of the beginning, more-so well into the end of the end.
","Oliver Hirschbiegel's 2005 film Downfall takes us deep into the realms of the last days of the Nazi regime, in doing so, physically takes us deep into the grounds of Berlin as The Second World War comes to an end in Europe because the Third Reich is falling apart. The film isn't so much about Adolf Hitler's downfall, an aura built out of the fact it's his presence over most of the posters and so forth twinned with a quite stunning portrayal of the man by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, as much as it is about the overall downfall of the Nazi party and their top officials located within Hitler's bunker. Crucially, the film does not end with Hitler's death but does so in a manner that sees a montage of sorts, featuring eventual outcomes of most of the other members of Hitler's grouping. This, as the fates of those involved in the film take their course during a pretty harrowing final thirty minutes.The film begins with documentary footage of sorts, as an elderly German woman engages in an interview just a few years prior to the film's release and talks of her involvement in the Nazi ring towards the end of the war as her duty as a secretary is explained. The opening establishes perspective, a sense of oral storytelling as one reflect back. In a film that'll see many-a decision made throughout the runtime, most of which end in death, it all starts with one very routine one: the hiring of a secretary. We ourselves are as fresh to both the setting and environment these others inhabit as the potential recruit is; there is that sense that we as an audience are being welcomed in along with the new secretary, indeed 'hired', to observe and engage in the new surroundings – this twinned with the immediacy of the person talking in the interview footage and the frequent constructing of most scenes through the new secretary's viewpoint, go a long way in establishing how we, as an audience, will watch the events play out.Downfall goes a long way in deconstructing how we might perceive Adolf Hitler, here he is vulnerable; scared even. If most Second World War films explore the making of the bed, Downfall is the slow realisation that one will have to lie in it. Whatever perception we have of Hitler going into the film; a probable image born out of countless, scratchy, black and white footage of the man standing on platforms resembling pulpits as his hand-and-arm-waving-rage streams out of him in a fury of loud, seemingly angry German ranting; then Downfall is prepared to go against type. He gets angry at certain points, sure – but the film is not interested in wholly delivering what audiences expect: we can feel the suffering and the bleakness of Hitler's eventual downfall without ever, and I mean ever, feeling sorry for the man, which is quite an achievement on Hirschbiegel's behalf.Hitler is given the kind of build up you'd expect, in fact you get the sense the film sort of revels in the ominous aura it establishes as he is spoken about whilst still off-screen; spoken to whilst off-screen before shuffling out in order to call in the first candidate. When one of them makes a mistake in the interview process, Hitler is forgivable; he acknowledges the mistake and allows the backtrack, painting an early image linked to the above paragraph. In the bunker, internal conflict sees the once tall, proud figures of top Nazi officials have their power decay and run to ruin. This is all underground, whilst the buildings and the Berlin architecture above is going through a similarly desperate transition as the Soviets and their Red Army close in. Child members of the Hitler youth, still acting on their death-or-glory dedication to the cause of defending the motherland's capital, stand firm and do their best to build defence emplacements and then fend off oncoming enemies in what isn't an easy, manipulative method of getting across raw feeling by using children and placing them in a vulnerable situation as a manipulation tactic, but is just a chilling re-telling of a real life predicament.And yet despite all these Nazi officials, it is through the eyes of Traudl Junge (Lara) that we see or observe events playing out; particularly evident when Hitler asks a number of people to leave a room so he may talk sternly to the remaining individuals – Junge is one of those asked to leave. The film hovers on the entrance from the outside as the secretary looks on, further giving off a sense of perspective, as everything transpires within. As the case-study between surface and below surface of confusion and chaos rages on, the film will cover a range of people going through a range of different emotions: characters will suffer sadness and become more depressed than others while others will become drunk more often than usual. As the realisation of the senseless waste of life the Nazi's incurred amongst most of Europe in their time comes to fruition, so too do the repercussions of it; with an additionally disturbing display of genocide, this time self-brought upon as the victims of which are so wholly infused within the political ideology they've just witnessed crumble around them, that surrender to the enemy is just simply not an option.Downfall is rather-an impressive achievement; bringing to life a very important, specific period within an equally important, specific period and rendering it the terrifying, enclosed thing it is; cleverly through the innocent perspective of someone with no political sway. It would be hard to single out an individual triumph over all else in Hirschbiegel's film, needless to say it documents, addresses and brings down to Earth without ever being political nor exploitative; many-a film has been made of World War Two but few as dissecting and closed off from the conflict as this one.",8,0,1,17 January 2010
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Everything you'd expect out of a blockbuster, including any flaws.
","I suppose Die Hard: With A Vengeance is a little bit of everything rolled into one. It is certainly all the things you'd want in an action film condensed into one complete package but the good and the bad both flow with each other. Die Hard: With A Vengeance is a basic and routine film on the scale of things with certain conventions and ideas slightly dumbed down with others being pushed outwards. I remember first seeing the film several years ago and being totally blown away by the opening thirty minutes or so  whilst most other films take their time in setting the scene, who's who and what the situation is, Die Hard: With A Vengeance blasts you with rock music, shows you some quick edits of New York and then hits you with its initial incident: a bomb in a busy street.The reason I mention the time when I first saw it is because after that initial explosion and chain of events, I felt the film settled into a groove of repetition and grew not dull but perhaps one dimensional. One advantage of starting slowly and doing everything by the book is that the film can finish strongly; the first and second Die Hard films are good examples of this with a lot of other 'buddy' films doing the same thing. Die Hard: With A Vengeance starts not at the twenty-five minute mark but at the twenty-five second mark; never letting up and although this works for the film, it can also work against the film. But to say the film is a failure is untrue as Die Hard: With A Vengeance does combine enough action, impressive set pieces and dialogue to quench the blockbuster thirst. The film uses the black sidekick device to get across its laughs and its protagonist-on-sidekick scuffles to good effect; something the Lethal Weapon films did rather well but regarding Die Hard, the sidekick is actually physically next to McLane (Willis) throughout the film, unlike in the first two when Al Powell and the controller in the control tower acted as the links via radio control in the first and second films, respectively.The idea of creating a sidekick for McLane that is both ally and foil is a clever one. Powell was always trying to aid McLane in number one; as was the controller in two and Farrell in the recent fourth addition. Here, Zeus Carver (Jackson in a memorable role) is so cooked up on racism and possible racist remarks that he will explode at the mere hint of any discrimination. Examples are found in the scene when the guy on the subway phone refers to him as 'bro' which enrages Zeus who was calm up until that point; another example is the taxi customer who mocks Zeus for apparently not accepting the fare because he is white, which forces Zeus to take the obnoxious fare on a taxi ride he won't forget. 'Don't ever let people use you.' He says to two kids in his shop at the beginning, thus hinting at how he will take McLane's and the police orders. Also, the character of McLane himself seems to taken onto another level. Instead of action hero like in one and two, director McTiernan starts McLane off as a sort of down and out noir anti-hero since he's suspended, wife-less and close to alcoholism: a man in internal ruin. There is also the reoccurring joke about McLane and modernity: in the second film, he says so himself that he should 'move into the 90s' as he operates a fax machine; in the fourth addition, he is likened to an analogue watch in a digital age. Here, he curses cell phones as he is cut off in a tunnel. It's a well known fact the police usually operate on two way radios, something that would've worked in that situation. McLane seems old fashioned in a metaphorical sense but also when it comes to his methods of dealing with the situation at hand; but he is successful. Person 'A' could write an amazing screenplay on a typewriter whilst person 'B' could write an abysmal one on a computer: it's how you get the end result that counts, not what you use to try and get there.In terms of narrative, the film uses a familiar cause and effect method of getting across its story. A recent film entitled Cellular is probably the best of recent efforts at exploiting this idea and it works in Die Hard: With A Vengeance to a degree. There are enough action set pieces to make the film feel truly epic with the race across New York through traffic and a public park to get you excited. The scene in the unfinished tunnel is also rather exciting with Simon (Irons) attempting to drown McLane. Not only this, but certain tasks engage the audience; challenging them to work it out; asking them 'How do you do it?' or 'what would you do now?' A good example is the scene by the fountain and the four gallons of water with a three and a five gallon jug. I had that worked out once but since forgot it. The film also makes good use of its New York location with that particular scene taking place amongst a backdrop of seemingly real people. There is also the subway, the park and the motorways used to good effect. Die Hard: With A Vengeance is a film that will entertain on a certain level but there are some frustrating incidents in which everything is moved forward clumsily. The editing seems a little brisk at times and there is a lot of shouting as the film moves along at such a pace but that aside, Die Hard: With A Vengeance is fun, engaging and a well written blockbuster; the likes of which are rare these days due to certain, tragic events.",7,0,0,5 January 2008
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Loud, obnoxious and woefully misjudged – newsflash: it's horrid.
","A collective sigh ought to sound up amongst the audience once the end titles for the horror-show that-is Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy begin to scroll, a collective sigh of relief that the pain is over and the fact that the characters we just spent the runtime of the film with are going onto the sorts of things that none of it's target audience will ever see or experience - and all that by way of acting in the manners they do throughout. The film is a misfire of monumental proportions, a horribly misjudged; badly executed piece whose very existence, whose very presence, on the screen just feels like a continuous two-fingers up gesture at the watching audience. What plays out under a very colourful; very false (in more ways than one) setting full of daft, glossy 1970s clichés and pastiches is a series of un-likable people doing leery, stupid and downright cruel things to one another; all under this painfully upbeat and colourful umbrella of the 'spoof' variety. In a word, it is shocking and I am stunned at the overwhelmingly positive reaction it has received.The film, whose overly long title does not deserve to be re-typed, is quite clearly supposed to be some sort of stupid spoof of egotistical driven, male dominated work places from yester-decade and the beginnings of the rise of female co-workers in this area. The film covers what Claire Monk wrote about in the late 1990s in regards to men in crisis and the rise in feminism, and that these sorts of things were being explored in British cinema of that time under the banner of comedy. But where Brassed Off and The Full Monty were more restrained in their humour and attitudes towards women and the respective desperate situations the guys were in, Anchorman ploughs on ahead without a destination in its brain and without a brain in its head; tearing up the road forever in search of pathetic, frat-boy inspired laughs.Will Ferrell plays the the titular role of Ron Burgundy, an anchor man at a California based TV network. He's the lead guy at a local news station and head of a crew of others that include sports reporters and weather guys. No distinction is made as to why he's the best in the business and as to why he's such the proclaimed genius everyone thinks he is, I guess he is purely out the fact he happens to be the one that introduces and concludes each broadcast. The man wears a sickly grin and kisses his biceps in what is an ego-driven and very masculine act that signifies power in the workplace, by way of muscular iconography. He dresses in loud suits and sweet-talks his way into and out of many-a situation, usually involving attractive women of some sort. Despite this titular-proclaimed legendary status, the man is severely and frighteningly mentally disturbed. I think the above cliché-ridden masculine archetype is introduced fairly well, but the film really wants us to buy into this character as he stands when the whole thing should be of the spoof variety. Rather than introduce and proclaim 'look how much of an idiot this guy is and how stupid his attitudes are', I think we're supposed to follow an ideation along the lines of: 'look how fantastic this guy is, and look at how he got to where he is by way of treating others'.What is supposed to be the direct conflict of the piece's characters arrives in the form of Christina Applegate's Veronica Corningstone, a female employed by the station after rising demands for female employees, and an instance of Monk's theory revolving around the rise of women in male dominated work places rearing its head. For about thirty to forty minutes the film does something with this idea, then it has its two leads sleep with one another before veering off into a dumb passage of play revolving around the two hating each other and working out new ways to demonstrate this hating. For what should be the best part, the film introduces a pig of a male character; has him seduce a strong and up-coming female character attempting to get a foothold as feminism arises with her; consequently bring her back down to Earth before branching out into a narrative that is about one rung above that of an episode of a Tom and Jerry cartoon.Burgundy is a living legend; he's both every male's idol and fantasy and sits atop both the TV ratings and his career path along with his crew. Yet the man is unaware of what 'San Diego' translates into out of the Spanish language; the man abuses his power rather than come to respect it when he attempts to pull women at a party at someone's pool house and on occasion, his dog talks to him, further pushing the film out into a scary realm it shouldn't really be treading anywhere near – maybe we ought to re-title the film 'The Legend of David Richard Berkowitz'. There's a really uneven sense of sexual predatory goings-on in Anchorman, and the realisation that it's the horrid and somewhat evil piece that it is settles in by way of an ominous and creepy fashion. The film's runtime is false; it needs dumb extra tidbits to bulk it out: a horribly misjudged scene in which a dog is supposedly killed is one of them, and a monumentally tired Sergio Leone pastiche had me with my head in my hands. Everything in the film bottoms out; from weatherman Brick's (Carell) role as the constant source of ridicule due to his own special needs, to the fact the film thinks constant shouting acts as something 'funny' on screen. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is trash of most misjudged, misguided order.",4,0,1,21 November 2009
The Reader," Wonderful film chronicling the fear, guilt and moral predicaments a young man undergoes when he thinks he's stumbled into a dream situation.
","The Reader begins in 1995 as a certain Michael Berg stands in his Berlin home early on in the day. There's a disagreement with a woman who's there as well; could be anybody, and she accuses him in an angry manner that he's been distant with her, ignoring her and that he is unable to follow the simplest of commands when it is revealed he did not wake her up. She storms out, and Michael is left to contemplate what's been said. It's a relatively straight forward but extremely poignant way in which to start capturing this person's attitudes to relationships and women. Berg doesn't have much of a retort to these accusations; as the film develops, we realise the importance a mere fling had on his life, and maybe we think that he's attempting to regress back to a child-like state, when off the cusp sex with strangers drastically opened his mind. Berg thought he knew of a certain female individual from many-a year ago, while the could-be deliberate 'distancing' himself in relation to the girl in the opening keeps the anonymity prominent.The film will eventually flash back to 1958, before returning to the then-present and chronicling various incidences and the years in which these things happened; all the while building to a rather tragic denouement. Ralph Fiennes plays Michael Berg as an adult, and he is accompanied by a certain David Kross, a young German actor whose career, based on this evidence, is promising to say the least. The film is all about Berg; how one chance meeting shapes lives, his and other people's. The film, like a certain book he reads to a certain Hanna Schmitz in his youth partly entitled 'Homer's', is an odyssey of what makes him who he and others are.It's a testament to Roger Daldry's film that The Reader can shoot all over the place in terms of jumping to specific times in people's lives spanning four different decades. The film never feels sporadic or dis-jointed, despite all this hopping about. I like The Reader a lot, predominantly because it unfolds over a number of years. It takes years to come to terms with some things; it takes years to comprehend certain other things. As a film that explores whatever friendships; relationships; acquaintancies or mutual-understandings two people of contrasting 'sorts' go through, or as a film that explores somewhat unnatural or 'taboo' understandings between two people, The Reader nails it.If one was to think of another recent example, Ang Lee's 2006 film Brokeback Mountain might count as a film that explored chance pairings, which in turn prolonged deeper feelings that rose to the surface as well as realisations of certain sensations. For Michael in The Reader, that sensation is coming-of-age. His relationship with Hanna is one that sees him engaging in rather regular sessions of a sexual nature following school; something he takes for granted; something that I think he sees as the equivalent of stumbling into a sexual fantasy, with absolutely no way of it terminating because it feels so right at that time for him. Within the actual relationship, Hanna adopts the more dominant half of the pairing. Her sheltering of Michael as he sits, helplessly, in the entrance of her apartment building coughing and shivering as a result of the driving rain, already establishes a position of power over a somewhat helpless flu victim. Once he's in better health, her ordering of him to fetch coal and to complete other such menial tasks takes over as the order of the relationship, and she dictates as to whether he will read to her before or after they engage in sexual episodes.Hanna's apartment as a cinematic space sees most of the small and un-kept location of her general living area as a location in which Michael, in his closed off Utopian place away from school and the family, can indulge in his whatever budding submissive and sexual sensations he, at that stage in his life, wants to explore. The most interesting aspect of this apartment is its bathroom area; a further space closed off within a location already established to be closed off. The bathing area comes equipped with a curtain on a rail, a physical and very symbolic object that allows the character to place a barrier between them and the rest of the living area – it is no coincidence that the two frequently find solace in this area, reading and so forth. At one point, Hanna hits Michael after a disagreement and an argument; she runs a bath; the bathing space is closed off from whatever goes on outside of it and they seem at ease again in what is some sort of recognition of the human form in its rawest form.The film develops, and Hanna cuts off contact with Michael, although they will both share a common bond between them in their time apart. Their respective journeys through life, following the affair, is all about coming to terms with the past, and accepting what you let happen. For Michael as he grows older, it is the fact he just jumped into the goings on with Hanna whereas for her, her bleak past to do with some Jewish-related atrocities that happened during The Second World War comes back to haunt. The study plays out wonderfully, with a lot of dramatic weight. As far as film-making goes, each period in history is superbly brought to life; the switching from dank, rainy evenings in the 1950s to the bright, sunny afternoons of the 1990s combine brilliantly while the young actor Kross impresses; particularly in a moment later on in which he notices Hanna after all those years and emotes the necessary emotions in his acting. As an all round piece exploring an array of various notions combining with the basics of bringing a text to life, The Reader excels.",8,0,0,31 October 2009
Jaws," Wonderful soundtrack, memorable moments, great pacing and a seemingly invincible shark make Jaws something special.
","I remember seeing Jaws a long time ago; well maybe it wasn't ages and ages ago but several years is more than enough time in-between viewing a film. What I expected from Jaws this second time given the amount of films from Spielberg I've seen since and the amount of films I'd seen as a whole anyway was something a tense, taught, 'slowly building it up and then hitting you' horror thriller. True, I couldn't remember much from the first viewing apart from some of the more memorable moments not only in Jaws but in film history overall; these included the finger nails down a blackboard scene and the now famous 'trombone' shot as Brody (Scheider) sits on the beach receiving a massage as the shark claims its latest victim.Even if what I got was very different to what I was expecting, that still isn't saying I didn't enjoy it after this gap. I found Jaws to be tight, clever, sharp and highly entertaining  the only real complaint being that the editing has not dated well. Some films are lucky to have anything truly memorable in them at all - Jaws has; in its opening twenty five minutes or so, about three to four things. These things, when either repeated or spoofed instantaneously remind you that it was from Jaws. These are things like the now famous musical score from John Williams, Quint's (Shaw) introduction with the blackboard, 'the' shot of Brody on his chair, the two swimmers in the opening scene and the wonderful point of view shots we have of the shark; allowing us, the audience, to be the killer every now and again.Not only do these events now have something of a 'cult' status but the pacing of each scene within the actual film itself took me by surprise  Jaws is, in truth, an unrelenting barrage of entertaining and unpredictable situations pieced together in such a fast and refreshing way, I'm amazed it didn't have a truly lasting impression on me the first time I saw it half a dozen years ago. The film really does suck you in, no exaggeration  and it does this through keeping a strong, steady figure (Brody) at the centre of the film whilst systematically introducing new characters and situations as it pleases. We are shown that Quint is around but his help is rejected although later on they need him, we are introduced to a shark expert from the mainland and find out a bit about him as things carry on and of course, the constant threat of the shark looms savagely making any shot or scene where either beaches or water is involved, truly uncomfortable and simultaneously, disturbing to watch.Not only this; but tension and anxiety is played with very effectively. When the shark expert Hooper (Dreyfuss) has to go down into the water and inspect the bottom of a boat even we are unsure as to whether it's safe. As well as this, when it's realised the shark is in the 'pond' part of the beach, where Brody's children are, we are equally unsure as Brody's children strike us (at least they did to me) as expendable characters  wouldn't give Brody a bigger and more personal drive to catch and kill the shark if his kids were victims? The scene involving and surrounding the capture of another shark early on is played with very well as some detective work is needed to work out if it's the right one.When Jaws enters its final third, it is quite literally 'man vs. beast' as these three guys are out at sea, no where to go and with a mission in mind: eliminate the shark problem. This is played out using several techniques and situations, all of which score. The sheer unpredictability of the film as well as the action that pops up every now and again is wonderful as guns, harpoons and even yellow tracking barrels are used to try and defeat the monster. When they realise defeating it from the surface is a little too hard, they even try and match it under the water resulting in a heart stopping scene involving a shark cage. It's not all barrage upon barrage on the animal, though  the shark wins its fair share of the fight. Jaws is very clever in its delivery, pacing and realism. It's also very entertaining and is up there with some of the best work Spielberg has ever done.",8,0,2,3 August 2007
The Wrestler," Arriving with a slam onto the canvas, Aronofsky delivers one of the films of 2009.
","The Wrestler takes both a pretty well worn premise and a pretty familiar narrative and does what mostly all impressive film-makers and films alike do: breath new life into them. Nobody begrudges The Wrestler its down and out set up that it incurs onto its lead, nor do they begrudge The Wrestler for its narrative arc that leads us down a route which will usually end with a climactic fight of some description. In The Wrestler, director Aronofsky renders these situations and events more interesting than they ought to be by way of a scuzzy and low-level aesthetic which compliments the raw and pent up feelings and emotions many of the characters we focus on possess. The film is a real outsider look; a glance into the life of a guy on the fringes as he partakes in some pretty shocking activity and attempts to get by in whatever manner he can. In short, it's a really exhilarating and emotional experience.The lead is Mickey Rourke's Randy the Ram, otherwise known as Randy when he isn't being referred to by his stage name. Randy was a big wrestler in the 1980s; big enough to have his name and what barely resembled his features by way of a few dozen pixels in an old, 1980s video game console wrestling game. He had a lot of fans - still does; and fought in a lot of big, high profile matches. Years later, he still operates on the circuit but at a much lower level. Rourke plays Randy pitch perfectly in regards as to whether he still enjoys wrestling as much as he used to. He sits, motionless in the locker room prior to fights contemplating whatever, while money is a problem as he balances a job in a convenience store during weekdays. Whether the drive is still there or not, the first instance of wrestling we're treated to in the film sees Randy kept until the last match so as to build to something – the fans haven't left and are still there, everyone still loves him and wants to see him win his match.Aronofsky shoots his lead, for the early duration, from behind at about head level. We rarely see Randy's face during the opening dozen minutes or so in what resembles a sort of third person video game perspective. Aronofsky does reveal his subject, but it's only at the times he is degraded or humiliated that we are able to look at him; the first instance of which is a reverse shot on some stairs when his boss at the shop insults his wrestling profession. The second is after a long tracking shot along the grounds of the trailer park in which he lives during which when he requests re-entry to his locked trailer from his landlord but is rejected due to late rental money. Randy turns around and, in what feels like an interior self-awareness of the camera on the character's behalf, faces us. The refraining from showing Randy's face early on apart from during these 'let-down' events aids Aronofsky's approach of creating a raw, very frontal and very exposed study of a man on the minorities and further aids in the alignment the audience will have towards him.The event that calls into question Randy's own opinions on life, the universe and everything occurs shortly after one of the more brutal, unflinching sequences in a film from recent memory; so brutal, in fact, that Aronofsky shows us the results of said sequence prior to, and in tandem with, a wrestling match which involved all manner of sordid weaponry and gadgets. But in actuality, Randy comes off a little more worse-for-wear than he'd have liked, and his weekend profession of leaping, slamming and bashing other big, bulky men is called into question following a heart attack shortly afterwards. Randy's only confidant, or indeed person he even communicates with on a regular basis that isn't of the negative ilk, is a certain Cassidy (Tomei); a stripper at a local club who becomes more and more involved in his life outside of the seedy place of business Randy has often frequented in the past. That said, their first interaction with one another sees her berate him for scaring off a potential group of clients as Randy's inability to read situations and connect with what's going on between human beings is ably reinforced, when he interrupts a group of men seeking out a private dance with her when things appear to have gotten a little heated. '200 bucks just walked out' she bellows. Recent critical readings of her own body acting as a means of entertainment or as a 'service', like Randy's as a wrestler, are made apparent here. The film brings to mind some of the writings from some years back about Hollywood and their attitudes towards their lead characters' bodies, predominantly in the action genre. The Wrestler sees its lead's body put through a similar physical grinder, one that sees it beaten, tested and pushed to the point of extreme. But the film brings these writings down to a lower, more visceral, level - we feel some of the pain with these wrestlers, and we certainly feel Randy's poor health infused pain. The film's crowning glory is in the form of the scene in which Randy meets up with his previously distant daughter named Stephanie (Wood), and they revisit a now decrepit old seaside funfair they used to frequent. She talks of the now burnt out ghost train, and how she found it truly frightening, although enjoyed going back in for some more. The sweetness of the scene lies within the fact that, no matter how much she previously despised him, she has at least inherited one aspect from her father: that sense of going through the grinder; through all the anguish and through the pain barrier, but in a perverse sort of way, enjoying it - all before coming back for some more.",8,2,2,15 December 2009
Kingpin," Why filmmakers decide to mix sport with COMEDY is beyond me and Kingpin is a good example of why not to.
","Something I've found with sports films is that the less funny they are, the better. When I say 'less funny', I mean when they're not attempting to be comedies. Some of the best sports films from down the years have been the ones that don't show sports as a joke; films that don't send up the sports and films that don't try to be funny. Raging Bull, The Hustler and The Colour of Money are amongst these examples with The Hustler and The Colour of Money particularly relevant examples. When it comes to humour in sports films, Happy Gilmore is probably the only one that I actually liked and which was supposed to be a comedy; odd how it too features a mentor with a false hand. Because of this, that means Kingpin is, in my opinion, a failure.This is quite a bump landing for Woody Harrelson who went from Natural Born Killers in 1994 to this junk with the mediocre but fun Money Train in between. Here, he doesn't play a cross country killer but a cross country bowling coach called Roy Munson as he coaches a protégé called Ishmael Boorg (Quaid). This is where the references to The Hustler and The Colour of Money come in  Kingpin is a failed and flawed version of these two films but with bowling replacing pool right down to the way the final tournament (in The Colour of Money) is started as each competitor simultaneously takes the first shot in their respective match.Kingpin has several basic things wrong with it that makes it disgusting, unfunny, badly paced and frustrating. I feel the biggest problem is the casting of Randy Quaid as the shy, innocent and all round good guy Ishmael. There's something I can't quite put my finger on that's wrong with it because the guy's delivery is flat and unfunny and the character in general is just too inconsistent. He's oblivious to the world despite his age yet can give monologues about life and how bad smoking is to people and inspire them to think differently. The fact he's also a complete idiot doesn't help the consistency of the character either. Also, the humour in Kingpin is rather pathetic yet at the same time, grotesque: the 'milking' of a bull scene was disgusting, the sex with the old landlady and the subsequent shots of Roy vomiting was uncalled for, the kissing of the elderly relative with the huge beard was nasty and topping it all of was Ishmael/Quaid himself dressed as some sort of drag queen stripper. None of this was funny or even pleasant to look at so you can imagine how very surprised I was when I realised that the script was actually written by someone over the age of ten.Kingpin tries to have a heart as it forces its protagonist to face former demons back at his home town about half way through. The reason these scenes are good is because the film isn't relying on dumb humour but also because the last time we were at these locations was in the opening which was very well done. The scenes of Roy as a boy bowling in is yard, the 1979 tournament and the way the camera and the disco music combines as he enters the alley is fun and very effective so how ironic that when Roy suffers his past tragedy, the film turns into a different type of beast. How very quaint that Roy also manages to give the definition of a mentor when he's trying to convince Ishmael to become his protégé without actually saying: 'I'll be your mentor'. Also, how very quaint that thanks to weak cause and effect a love interest manages to worm its way into the plot. Kingpin is perhaps fun for the first fifteen minutes but then misses the mark more times than it should with gross, unfunny humour; bad characterisation of the protégé and just a really bland feeling that it's trying too hard to be funny as well as tragic.",5,3,8,14 September 2007
Hancock," Hancock's one-and-a-half-hour is an hour of formula done well and then a disappointing conclusion.
","Here is a superhero film that has its superhero inhabit a world in which the inhabitants themselves demonise the superhero rather than glorify him. If we look at the film poster for Hancock, we can see him in all his 'ugly' glory, an immediately unflattering appearance; thrust into our faces with large sunglasses and an illogical for-the-genre hat which, in my opinion, makes him look more daft than anything else. But this is part of the pull for the film Hancock; the gimmick being that he does not need a mask or a costume (at first) to hide his true identity like Spider Man or Batman do but indeed almost welcomes criticism and exposure by turning up in the most unruly of manners and 'saving the day' in the most unorthodox of manners. The scene in which he stops a car from being hit by a train and a whale from dying on a beach could easily have been handled in a better and more logical manner, but it's almost as if Hancock deliberately hits the train and the boat in these scenes to create problems.But Hancock is really two different sorts of beast. You can envisage the pitch and the idea for the film revolving around a superhero of everyday 'quality' who goes on his own minute journey of discovery and re-image but I think that's as far as the film goes in terms of good ideas. That is to say, when a certain element does make itself known the resulting plot point is both disorientating and disappointing. But mercifully, rather than give us a great point of attack before lambasting us with a daft resolution, the film creates a jovial atmosphere for the first two-thirds and generally keeps us interested rather than merely entertained for this period  it is the final third that needed more care and attention with that sole plot point the reason for the film coming off the rails a tad.The first thing you do notice about the film, and you don't have to be in a multiplex to identify it, is its hero is African-American. It's good but somewhat interesting to see a superhero of the non-white variety to perhaps rival the character of Blade, comic books of course being written decades ago at times of, shall we say, 'racial indifference' and thus; the majority of comic book heroes are of course white. But the film is still needlessly racist towards certain groups: the French boy named Michael (Faerch) who doubles up as a neighbourhood bully towards Aaron Embrey (Head) of the Embrey family that takes Hancock in, is in particularly poor taste as is Hancock's stereotypical view on Norwegians and what they typically look like. Additionally, did any one else notice the ridiculous subtitles during the beginning chase as said by the Vietnamese gangsters? Some of the subtitles were not even grammatically correct suggesting the Vietnamese speak in that fashion anyway. From memory, I think one of the lines were 'What you doing here!?' But other than this the film is a textbook, and I mean textbook, example of how to establish a down and out character before rebuilding him and having him accomplish his goals. The film runs at 92 minutes according to IMDb, 62 minutes of those are the good stuff in which Hancock (Smith) will begin as a down and out guy; meet and be motivated by a mentor of some sort; go through a training montage (which are the prison scenes); overcome some fears and doubts before getting his opportunity to put ideas into practice and win through in the end. Some scenes that are in the textbook in this case are the ones in which Hancock begins to miss the basketball hoop and begins to speak out during the rehab seminars. He is then given the chance to redeem himself one day after receiving a phone call whilst in his cell  what will await him, him having learnt these new social skills and ability to channel energy? And so I can pinpoint the exact moment in which the film ends for me. It is when, during said test, the protagonist overcomes doubts and, in reference to cheesy superheroes of the past, gives a salute; wishes everyone luck in a booming 'Captain America' voice and probably should remind everyone to recycle or something, that he flies off having passed. From here the film hits a wall, a wall that even Hancock cannot recover from so God knows what it must've been made of. Certain coincidental revelations occur and I was disappointed since the film decides it needs a villain to round things off. Hancock is no longer a villain to himself so a third party needs to enter the fray and that was rather sad. Still, while it lasts Hancock is an entertaining and somewhat amusing ride although a lot of the jokes either miss the mark (such as the repeating 'pass' at the rehab) or are just not that funny for anyone aged over twenty.While the themes of religion feel out of place and the fact a certain group of individuals lay siege to a certain location for the finale to produce one of an explosive nature, Hancock is alright for what it is but what gripe I did have involved where Hancock was during most of the Twentieth Century  surely he could've helped out during the Pearl Harbour attack or the Munich Olympics hostage situation; I guess he, the slacker that he is, took those days off.",6,1,3,24 July 2008
Hitch," Fanciful without ever feeling too distant or with a distinct, mean-spirited streak; thanks largely to Tennant's good work with the material early on.
","Had it been made any worse than what it is, Hitch may well have been a wry; sly; misguided; totally unredeemable; sexist piece of garbage with no redeeming value, whereas had it been produced a little better than what we get, the film may have been a much more nourishing, much more satisfying comedy about relationships and confronting one's fears. As it is, Hitch falls between two stalls, two rather extreme stalls; it isn't by any means a bad film but is one far more underwhelming that it really ought to have been. It's also a lot longer than it has any right to be, Andy Tennant's direction feeding off of a Kevin Bisch screenplay sees Tennant prove fairly quickly that he can negate most of the early stuff to do with set up; quick-fire dialogue and humorous character exchanges. Problem is, by the time everything's slipped off into more serious territory and these people's lives threaten to fall apart as friendships; trust and links break down, the film thinks its carrying more dramatic energy than it actually is and thus, falls a little flat. Regardless, and for the best part, we've come to both care for as well as become a tad fond of the characters on show enough to stick it out.Will Smith plays the titular Hitch, a fast piece of casting in that Smith is an easy guy to get behind and the character of Hitch is somebody we need to observe the good in from the very beginning. Hitch's life effectively sees him stalk women for somewhat of a living; the taking of notes and the careful forming of plans in a calculated manner so as to have them hook up with the poor men whom come to him, so desperately seeking said women, Hitch's line of work. An early sequence renders such a situation one that relies on comic timing and physical comedy more than anything else, when a man's preordained meeting with a woman whose dog goes missing via an elevator mix up in the lobby of a building sees one of Hitch's many plans of action put into motion and successfully working. One day, the man Hitch himself refers to as a project that'll come to resemble his 'Sistine Chapel', a certain Albert Brennaman played by Kevin James , lands in his lap. His goal: to woo wealthy woman and celebrity Allegra Cole (Valletta) with whom he works at a large company.On another strand, Eva Mendes' Sara Melas is a high powered journalist whom we have to go along with believing that she cannot get a man; something that eerily appears to bother her co-workers more than it does her. Throughout the duration of the film, which is probably a good half an hour too long, their lives and stories will come to entwine with a few harsh truths learnt along the way. The film is one of those to unfold in a New York City that appears to only exist within both the movies and the minds of fanciful would-be tourists whom are yet to venture out to said city, and its something that's grated a lot more in the past with other films than it does here. Additionally, a lot of Smith's to-camera bantering echoes that of Woody Allen during years of old. Tennant and his crew take little time to inform us on where everybody stands regarding Hitch, the notion of such a character existing and doing what he does is addressed very early on. Any ideas of the man being a cold-blooded misogynist, whom despises women because of a prior tragedy at college during which one of them showed him up before coming to uses this lease of life to artfully teach men how to seduce the women they'd usually never get anywhere near, are addressed and banished very quickly: an interaction with one of your more stereotypical New York yuppies at a diner raising the item before having Hitch essentially reject it.We like Albert, principally because he's a little chubby and comes across as a kind of likable enough guy whom wears glasses and has a name like Albert. James and Smith build up quite a rapport, their scenes with each other are far funnier than they have any right to be; his tale to do with the trying to have Allegra notice him sweet and good natured with both the fact we only really realise how much we were enjoying it and how effective it actually was becoming apparent by the time Smith and Mendes' story has overridden it, itself somewhat underwhelming. Like Hitch, Melas is high flying in her chosen career and like Hitch, she sticks to a strict procession of rules that govern her life and job – barely, like Hitch, finding time for a love life. Their coming together and consequent falling apart is entertaining enough; the energy and punch that infuses that first conversation they have at a local night spot at a table sadly only as good as it gets there and then. Later on, a long stretch during which Melas accuses him of being something the film has already gone to extreme lengths to point out he isn't tires us; the physical comedy embedded within the film by this point as equally prominent as it is merely unwelcome. Despite its flaws and pacing problems and the fact a lot of what happens later on might be cured with a simple 'No, it didn't actually happen', Hitch successfully in a minute manner hooks us up and we enjoy our time with it overall.",6,0,0,22 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Your lack of faith in these prequels is, broadly speaking, not disturbing.
","If the final film of the original trilogy went out with somewhat of a bang, then this final film of the three prequels fizzles out with a bit of a whimper; the masking of the Vader character proving, it would seem, to be somewhat less enthralling than the unmasking. This is not to say that 'Revenge of the Sith' is totally irredeemable, but its final act, the grand finale to the first half of the life-arc of a character that has captured people's imaginations for decades, plods to its destination and falls over the line instead of bursting through the tape, arms aloft. Much of this lies, I think, in the direction, which isn't entirely sure how to execute what is, in essence, a downer-ending to a summer blockbuster belonging to a franchise which has become synonymous with thrills; spills; excitement and, I suppose, HAPPY endings.'Revenge of the Sith' consists of two strands: one is the development and culmination of a conflict initiated in the last film over power and trade between a rebel force of solar systems, operating out of rocky desert planets and consisting of coalitions of odd looking creatures, and a Jedi council based in a shiny metropolis that is a picture of modernity.The second is, at least is supposed to be, the depiction of a bleak; un-nerving descent of one man into the 'dark' side of his world's core philosophy - 'the force'. This character is Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden Christensen, whose great transition into this monster, we are told, essentially precipitates on three things: sulking over being hired to the Jedi council, but not made a master; sulking over not being permitted a mission he really wanted and, crucially, a mere nightmare of his soul-mate dying.The film begins with a sequence, which is too long and too akin to what the Bond films do pre-credits, depicting Anakin and his mentor, Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), in the middle of an inter-galactic battle with those the Jedi are fighting on account of the enemy having kidnapped a highly important chancellor. This rather chaotic sequence starts in outer-space with a dog-fight; sees the heroes infiltrate the landing area of a huge cruiser and the corridors of the ship itself; sees them confront the villains and attempt an extraction.The opening becomes jarring for the fact it begins to feel plastic, as if Lucas is ticking off a list of things he thinks fans want to see: swordplay; dogfights; R2D2 fooling about; comedy in near-death situations and Jedis on a mission. It is during this sequence we meet General Grievous, who is some kind of skeletal creature that hides behind, it must be said, fairly thin body armour and possesses a chesty cough. But he also has a small collection of light sabres, inferring, perhaps, that he has conquered Jedi in fights in the past.Eventually, everybody congregates back at Jedi headquarters and the film, as Episode 2 did, splits off into its separate strands involving Kenobi going solo to find Grievous in order to halt the war, and Skywalker remaining behind to be with his partner Padme (Portman). Cleverly, Lucas shoots Skywalker and Padme in the shadows of a great hall, dressed in black, when we first see them, highlighting how secretive or shadowy they must live given Padme is pregnant and this must be kept secret. You might also say, given Kenobi is in brighter, whiter clothing, the difference foreshadows the light/dark dynamic which will characterise Anakin's arc.From here, the film, though certainly threatening to fall apart, bumps along with a series of, often unintelligible, decisions taken by characters; bland second unit spectacle and scenes of genuine philosophical choice which, while interesting on paper, do not really get beyond the level of three out of five. Kenobi, just as he begins to sense doubt about Skywalker; Padme and the whole set-up, maddeningly agrees of depart the situation when he is, arguably, desperately needed at home.Meanwhile, besotted by Padme and terrified of losing her as per his vision, Yoda offers Anakin the Jedi outlook of not worrying about loss and refuting attachments to items and people. More tempting, however, is the Chancellor's (Ian McDiarmid) approach: keep those you really love alive forever with powers one can only acquire away from Jedi teaching and with the Dark. He has this chat with Skywalker during a strange operatic light-show, which depicts rays of light thrashing around from one body to another thus highlighting Anakin's increasingly scrambled outlook.Is the film's message here that love, ultimately, is a bad thing? Indeed, Padme even asks Skywalker whether love has 'blinded' him. 'Seems it has...' comes the reply. I could not believe there was no healthy medium between 'sever all feelings for someone' and 'become an incarnation of evil in order to save those whom you feel for the most'. Skywalker's descent into one thing over the other is not altogether convincing, and on occasion is flatly absurd for the aforementioned reasons: sulking over not being referred to as a 'master'? Really? Other things begin to unravel: does Christensen have the punch to really carry the material/performance? How did he think Padme, above all else, would react to his transition, or even murdering Jedi trainees?To some extent, Episode 3 is a departure from, not only the series, but Hollywood blockbusters generally: it isn't very often you see a mainstream film culminate with sadness; death; massacre and, ultimately, the beginning of a war, and I'm afraid it just doesn't quite come off. Neither does the meat of the project, a descent into a kind of madness, a tragedy, really have the snap it needs. It may not be as goofy as its cousins, but it leaves you feeling it could've been more.",6,1,4,6 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A disappointing end to a rather disappointing prequel trilogy.
","When I started watching the Star Wars prequels I was maybe expecting something a little higher than what I actually found. I hadn't seen the original trilogy but I was confident Lucas would be able to make a couple of good films using today's CGI and since you can only get better at something the more you do it; maybe these films thirty years on would, in fact, be rather impressive. The only negative opinions I'd heard surrounding these films were from hardcore fans of the originals anyway; something I certainly am not. But, what was disappointing in the end was that this little series of films missed the mark more often than not; episode three guilty in its own way.I could see what Lucas was trying to achieve with Revenge of the Sith; it's just that I couldn't quite grasp the emotion nor feel the feelings I was supposed to throughout, particularly nearer the end. I'm sure fans of the first three Star Wars films were on absolute tenterhooks as Obi-Wan and Anakin battled amongst lava, falling rock and loud explosions; a lightsaber battle to rival any of the previous ones seen in this trilogy but the whole time; I was under-rawed, I was un-entertained and I was just accepting it for what it was: A good end fight scene to round off a pretty average, summer film full of CGI. It brought back emotions I felt during the end of Return of the King (2003).What Revenge of the Sith did right that I found the other two did wrong, was grab the script by the neck and keep it consistent throughout. This means that in this film; all the cheesy, 'buddy talk' dialogue has been scrubbed out and its been replaced by half decent, half serious talk that actually advances the plot and gives the film an atmosphere and a darker feel. This is, after all, the final episode of the trilogy so something's got to give  something amid all the previous errors and head-shakingly bad film-making has to give way. I'm sure most Star Wars fans would have found Anakin's decent into madness (which is labelled 'The Dark Side' in this galaxy) pure edge-of-the-seat entertainment but for me, it was nothing too fantastic. The characters you just know are going to die end up dying, most of the time the film gives you that feeling of 'Oh, it's time for a lightsaber dual  let's go' and it then complies with itself but more often that not  you're just sitting there begging them to get on with it. You know it's going to happen so quit dragging it out already. Although, as I said; fans of the original trilogy probably didn't get this frustrating feeling.Even if Revenge of the Sith eliminates some flaws from the other two, it does in true Star Wars tradition, keep some. The annoying cutaways to other scenes when you're half way through a battle or an action sequence are still there and this is a very perplexing way of presenting a film, especially one so epic and on such a large scale as this. Can you imagine a Lord of the Rings film randomly cutting away from an intense fight scene with a few hundred orcs? Can you picture the remake of King Kong cutting from the raptor/stamped scene to two people talking as they make their way back to the boat? I can but I don't want to, as I'm sure is the same with you.On the whole, The Revenge of the Sith is an epic, over the top, plenty of CGI and 'acting talent you know like the back of your hand', throwback film for fans of Star Wars  nothing more. If you're a fan of Star Wars: watch away. If not, steer clear as it will be no more than popcorn entertainment. Too bad a standard bag of popcorn doesn't last the length of this film, though.",6,1,4,2 April 2007
The Lion King," Strong and engaging animation film that has its issues and its messages but delivers on an entertaining level above all else.
","I suppose it's fun to re-visit a Disney film every now and again; The Lion King holding a rather special place in my psyche as well as my heart for it was the first film I ever saw at a cinema. Needless to say; watching it now for perhaps the first time proper since that cinema viewing hasn't made me like it or love it any more than I perhaps did then but it hasn't made me dislike it any more, either.The Lion King was made at a time when Disney was booming. The 1980s wasn't exactly a great decade for Disney but what with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and the best picture Oscar nominated Beauty and the Beast; Disney were thriving. So there was an expectancy behind The Lion King and watching it now, it does deliver on an entertaining and well told and well animated level. I laughed at some of the jokes, couldn't remember certain scenes and generally enjoyed it. But the film does feel like it is orientated at children more than adults. The general synopsis for the film does not rely on a love story like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast did but rather uses a theme of self discovery with a rather meek love plot entwined between Simba and Nala; the two lead lions of the narrative. This would suggest more of an infant target audience as the film would like to think it is educating young ones on how to face your fears and beat your demons etc.But this isn't a criticism, merely an observation. Aladdin was as routine love story as you could ever get but it included the genie as a post-modern stroke of genius that made the adults laugh. Similarly; the complicated love story in Beauty and the Beast, full of emotions and situations kids won't have experienced yet had the items of furniture that amused and entertained on another level. In The Lion King, there is no get out clause; there is no escape hatch that the film can rely on to get across to two demographics. I suppose if Simba's journey of enlightenment is supposed to be aimed at adults then the buddy combination of Timon and Pumbaa are supposed to be kid orientated but I didn't see it entirely this way  yes Timon and Pumbaa seem adult enough but they remain too lacking in everything else what with the emphasis of toilet humour cropping up every now and again.Like most Disney films, The Lion King suffers from its issues with race, religion, class and/or gender. People will deny it but that's only because they cannot see it. The lions in The Lion King are golden brown, beautiful and voiced by Americans; all apart from Scar who is brown with a black mane. It's no surprise that he is the 'evil' one and is consequently English, voiced by Jeremy Irons. There is also the shameful representation through the hyenas: one is Mexican, one is a mute retard and the other may well be voiced by an American (Goldberg) but in truth; the character is a big, black, loud, 'man-eater' of an animal. Watch Aladdin when the title character steals a loaf of bread and the representation of the fat black woman who hugs him whilst saying the line: 'Still I think he's ravishing!' There is also the character of Timon who is the victim of Disney's most cruel representation. Timon's gender is confused; it is neither male nor female and his name is too ambiguous to be classed as one or the other. Timon is extremely effeminate and embodies very 'touchy-feely' traits around Pumbaa; frequently stroking his rear-end and stroking his nose and general facial area. Timon's voice actor Nathan Lane is also homosexual and I read that the line towards the end where the distraction tactic of 'dressing in drag and doing the hula' was improvised, further embodying homosexual traits on this character. Now; whilst my specific class/race/sexuality/etc. wasn't targeted to extremities (Scar was English, like I am but I'll look past that); I still feel these sorts of things are highly unnecessary in a film I've already established is child orientated.The characters are also obsessed with food. There is frequent reference to food and hunger. The lionesses report no food which angers Scar, Pumbaa belches before announcing that he is 'starved' and the Hyenas live in a constant state of looking where the next meal will come from. There is also heavy emphasis on how Timon and Pumbaa get by on nourishment by eating bugs. Perhaps this is reference to Africa's state of affairs regarding health and food with the Ethiopian humanitarian crisis of the 1980s fresh in memory. The Lion King also suffers in its obvious plotting: the hero has a wrong belief but needs a mentor to come out of the blue to aid him in his correct quest which I found a little forced and unoriginal for a film made in 1994. But the message about the 'circle of life' and the ideas that you confront your demons when required is good with Mufasa himself saying 'I'm only brave when I need to be; I don't go looking for trouble.' The film clearly saying that picking fights is not a good idea.The Lion King also has time to throw in a domestic relationship featuring Simba and Nala. They meet up; reminisce; Simba shows her around and to 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight', they make love before breaking up the morning afterwards. Incidentally, the sex is witnessed by Timon who displays disappointment and disgust. The Lion King is a somewhat strange film but has fun with its plot and its characters and is an enjoyable animation film on the whole with one or two tragic scenes particularly standing out in memory for me; both then in the cinema and now.",7,1,3,16 January 2008
Inception," Often interesting, if dressed up, film doing well to quite literally explore the mind of a troubled lead as it adheres to creative science fiction and heist sub-genre demands.
","I enjoy the fact that Inception arrives with some fairly good ideas to it and isn't afraid to have a little fun with them; when several characters are in a deep sleep inside of a moving minivan, which is being chased by would-be mercenaries armed to the teeth and wholly taking advantage of that fact, they are thrown around and thrust about inside of the collective world of their slumbers as if an earthquake were happening therein – all because of the grief their unconscious bodies suffer in 'reality'. The film is close to all but full of little instances such as these, the bulk of them more interesting that any sort of narrative the writer/director of the piece Christopher Nolan has going on; as indeed are they a great deal more than any sort of attention to character the film has unfolding within it beyond that of its lead's. There is a nagging feeling throughout Inception that somewhere along the line, an original idea mutated into an assembly line actioner; when it's established that anonymous gunmen turn up to fire upon the lead characters having entering somebody's state of sleeping, it is explained they are the subconscious reacting negatively to intruders within the person's mind: neat idea. By the time we're all storming an isolated dream-scape base drenched in Arctic conditions, guns blazing whilst engaging with those gunmen, it's veered away from its smart foundations and become a snow-set Call of Duty level. Inception's lead is a certain Dom Cobb, played effectively by Leonardo DiCaprio; a man occupying an unspecified future not too dissimilar to that of our own present but which happens to house an invention capable of entering that of a human-being's dream. We begin in the present, the film essentially one long flashback; we see Cobb washed up on a heavily guarded island beach rife with Japanese iconography before taken to meet an elderly man whom reacts to seeing him. When we dart back to before they would have first met, we observe Cobb standing in stark contrast to that of when we saw him during the opening; Cobb here is smart and well dressed and is far better shape; the ability to identify specific British artists of-old when observing a painting at a function suggesting degrees of sophistication in that regard. Inside, Cobb is a troubled man; his dead wife, who's fittingly named Mal – incidentally the French word for 'bad', here played by the French actress Marion Cotillard, weaves in and out of his own mind causing havoc in a fairly unique way as he strives to get home to his two young children whom he has not seen in years. The truth with Mal looms over proceedings impressively.His field is that of essentially thieving, Cobb's crucial piece of kit to his line of work a series of pipes and tubes linked to a machine small enough to fit into a briefcase complete with its own infrastructure and framework; an invention enabling one to connect it to another human and enter their dreams. We have to latch onto things quickly in this regard; the film does not much pause for thought as this utensil is used as it is – it is established to exist; it is established people use it and are familiar with it and we must catch on. Cobb is approached by a rich Japanese businessman named Saito (Watanabe), his idea on this, Cobb's retirement time, to do the seemingly impossible and achieve 'Inception'; the placing of a memory or psychological item into that of a person's dream, in this case to make Cillinan Murphy's Robert Fischer, son of a dying billionaire, think he should divide the company up and do all manner of wrongfulness to benefit Saito. Bruce Willis' immortal line to Hans Gruber nearer the end of the first Die Hard seeing him exclaim to us precisely where he stands upon realising everything that had just transpired was, essentially, so as to steal something at this point rearing its head. The film covers, to varying degrees of interest, Cobb's employment of a team to do the never before attempted. His first is Eames, (Hardy) an ice-cool Brit. whom dwells in the hostile surroundings of African township casinos whom shares some, but not enough, amusing antagonism with Cobb's lifetime work partner in Gordon-Levitt's Arthur. In addition to proceedings, Ellen Page's young Architect Ariadne, whose role it is to literally construct the dream-scape, sees Page lumped with the role of the newbie to the proceedings – a role which we very much map onto ourselves in this regard as she asks all the questions and needs most things explained to her in the manner we do. Strip away most of the exterior and Inception is a relatively simplistic film; like Gilliam's troubled movie of six months earlier in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, although not as enjoyable, the premise is fairly condensed, if routine, and is near-enough embedded within the realms of straight forward genre – right down to the crew of guys sitting in a warehouse around whiteboards housing plans as they knock around ideas. The kick being that both projects have this wildly inventive item or core idea at the very centre of them, something which cannot help but demand creativity and incident along side dramatic content inducing the odd bout of awe on top of what might be at its heart a very simple story about a love triangle or an affluent but corrupt individual going to a man for one last job and asking him to do 'x' and 'y' . The film is a sharp, if ultimately overly long, but engaging science-fiction with enough action and familiarised photogenic stars in it so as to draw in the mainstream crowds in that regard; not to sound too dismissive, the film has its merits and its triumphs and is impressively reigned in by its creator but is far from dreamy.",6,2,6,15 May 2011
Lord of War," Deceptive and depressing film that seduces its audience into a world of humour and inappropriate glorification.
","How sad to stumble across a film like Lord of War, a film that thinks itself to be a powerful and political statement on the world as we perhaps don't know it, whilst at the same time trying to incorporate conventional action film ideas but ends up as a morally inept, casual look at the life of arms dealing through a character that we are led to believe really exists. There is no justice in Lord of War; there is no feeling, just an air of arrogance as the film flies through scenes; voiceovers and scenarios of great danger with so much ease, we are perhaps tempted to laugh at it all. But whilst films that are morally bankrupt and centre around an anti-hero of sorts can be good fun, they should never be produced with the idea in mind that the anti-hero's actions are right or 'just'.Alas, Lord of War makes that mistake. I wonder how many kids, or indeed stupid people in general, came out of the cinemas or watching this film thinking 'Wow, doesn't being an arms-dealing look cool!?' We don't come away from films like Scarface, Blow and Layer Cake thinking being a gangster or a drug dealer looks like great fun with cash, women and a lifestyle because of what happens to those films' anti-heroes but Lord of War seems to want us to think that being a gun runner with similar lifestyle traits is a very good career move. If we look at Layer Cake, the opening voiceovers provided by Craig's character inform us of his situation and the fact he has the audacity to assume himself to be a 'business man' rather than a drug-dealer; we are not immediately on his side because of this terrible assumption. But later he is given a drug-unrelated mission by a boss and this propels him into a world in which he must prove himself to himself as well as us. The film becomes a passage of the protagonist showing us he can cut it when heart and soul is required to win through and adversity (traitorous employees, etc.) needs to be beaten. By the end, we feel he has proved himself and maybe we have forgiven him for getting 'business man' muddled up with 'drug dealer'.In Lord of War, protagonist Yuri Orlov (Cage) does not have heart or soul. He is like one of those hormone fuelled young male adults at a grotty nightclub; ever sensing and ever looking out for the next lay. In Lord of War, Yuri wants the next batch of guns so he can sell and re-distribute to places run by people he couldn't care less about. Much like a drug-dealer would not care if his customer overdoses on the stuff he supplies. But this is the film's problem, it assumes we will care for Yuri despite who he sells to. Unlike Layer Cake, Yuri is never given a chance to redeem himself like Craig's character is; he is constantly buying and selling to the nastiest people imaginable without care.The majority of the trouble with the film is its seductive mannerism and its tempting way it goes about its subject matter. In Nicholas Cage, we have an actor who very rarely plays a really nasty character. This seductive piece of casting of a name and a face we have an opinion of before even going into the film immediately draws us to 'side' with him. Secondly, the film has been constructed in a very clever way that brainwashes its audience. The film is full of funny voiceovers and situations we are supposed to laugh at. I wonder how many people actually laughed at the opening quote about 'arming the other x% of them'. Similarly, when Yuri finds himself in an African village with two girls specifically there to sleep with him, despite the high presence of AIDS, I wonder how many others will have laughed at the manner in which Yuri established the situation, the camera cutting to the two women trying to seduce him, the voice-over accompanying the scenario and the editing during which they are dismissed. This four pronged technique creates a light atmosphere in a situation that is dangerous; political and definitely un-funny.And yet the film continues in its siege on the ridiculous, glamorising the depressing and serious, while making jokes out of serious political issues of recent years. There are numerous shots of the AK47 assault rifle in slow motion, slow motion being powerful and significant tool to use on any subject in any film. Then there are the voiceovers dedicated to the gun and the close up montage of it, further fetishising the product: aren't guns so cool? Just look at them. Lord of War is the sort of film that will show us an execution during a particularly nasty scene but will cut to the next situation and have it accompanied by some upbeat music. The film is not in good taste and the immediate ending which brutally betrays the rule of thumb for anti-heroes in films fuelled by crime is very disappointing; not on a dramatic level but on a moral one. Remember that Scarface quote: 'Don't get high on your own supply'? Lord of War's tagline is 'never get shot with your own merchandise.' This is the only connection between one very good and one very poor film that tackle the glamorisation of a certain element within the crime genre. Given how delicate America's gun situation is at the moment, maybe we should all stop making films that make guns and people who have guns look good.",5,1,3,12 July 2008
WALL·E," Out there, is indeed, a world beyond Yonkers.
","In a sense, WALLE reminded me of 1999's The Iron Giant. Both are about two individuals whom share a mutual appreciation for one another, one agent is a relatively weak and unspectacular subject, alone and living a quiet and unspectacular life – finding companionship in the most oddball of ways be it through insects or small rodents in The Iron Giant's protagonist's case. One day they happen to stumble across another being, something not immediately attached to the 'world' they've been living in – an agent from the 'outside' that comes down, shrouded in mystery but also danger. In the respective films' case, it is The Giant itself and EVE in this particular film. What follows is an appreciation but more importantly, an understanding between the two as they get up to adventures and defend what they believe is right. Those being, The Giant's 'right' to stay on Earth with the boy and mankind's 'right' to return to Earth following evidence of growth.It was equally refreshing to see a film clearly addressing issues that surround contemporary living, looking at the environmental problem and the consumer driven issues that have acted as a bane of recent living. But WALLE is, apart from these things, a cracking adventure; a chase film of sorts; a film with some very funny and very touching moments in equal measure played out with the best of buddy intentions. The character of WALLE is voiced by a sound designer named Ben Burtt. He voices WALLE with a series of bleeps and electronic noises as this quaint little robot rolls around a desolate Earth. Earth has become a deserted wasteland; a relic of times gone by as heaps of trash have been formed into solid looking structures by robots designed to clean up. Prior life on Earth, it would seem, were encouraged to 'buy large' and look where it got them.The actions of WALLE himself echo the human's past lives: he is a slave to the system, stuck in the same process of doing what he's programmed to do. Every day he takes his little lunch box out with him; constructs what he's told to do and takes home stuff he doesn't really need for sake of display. The film cleverly humanises WALLE in this way, having him 'wake up' like human beings only his requirement is sunlight rather than exposure to a cold bathroom and a good shower to get things going. But WALLE is more like a human in the feelings department, despite being of the robotic variety. EVE, whose voice artist Elissa Knight brings said robot to life with a similar string of bleeps and electronic voices, is a female droid sent down from a yet unknown location to look for life specimens. EVE's role brings about a certain biblical meaning. If we presume the world has undergone a flood and the ship from whence EVE has come is something that resembles Noah's Ark, then EVE herself is a brilliant white dove, sent out from yonder to discover life and prove that it is safe to return or that the 'flood' has ended.As a character, EVE carries this smooth and finished post-modern look. Whilst modelled on an Apple Computer from a few years ago, she is initially hostile, destroying anything that moves and actually quite threatening. WALLE 's build of withered, worn and running on caterpillar tracks looks quite inferior, establishing a sense of superiority as to EVE's character and wherever she came from. The event that kicks the film into gear is the offering of a plant to EVE, one that WALLE himself found and plucked. EVE's mission is complete but we are all unaware of the importance just now and her protective shut down sequence allows WALLE to manoeuvre around her whilst eventually come to love her.Then we discover where EVE came from when the ship comes back for her and the gears change once again. A sense of adventure arises and a new 'space' becomes visible. The ship itself is a disenchronian space, in which people relax and are free to do as they wish with virtual golf and tennis readily available, but with consequence. In amidst this sea of supposed tranquility lies mankind, a drastically overweight and increasingly reliant on machines mankind. Behind the scenes is AUTO, a machine actually voiced by a machine through Apple Computers programme 'MacInTalk'. If he had a fist, it'd be made of iron and if he were in charge, he'd be ruling with it. Inferior or 'broken' robots are rounded up and set off somewhere while when the human's threaten to feel emotion or break away from their 'slumber', it angers AUTO. But he stands beside incompetent Captain McCrea (Garlin), with an eye always on the bigger picture: eternity in space in which the machines dominate the humans and mankind are unable to learn from their consumer driven mistakes of the past. WALLE director Andrew Stanton even brings a touch of the HAL 9000 to AUTO and moulds him into the shape of a steering mechanism, the kind found on ships of yester-century.Sewn in amongst all this is a chase to get the MacGuffin mentioned, the development of WALLE and EVE's fondness for one another the general threat that all will be lost, during which rather a lot rests on certain individuals against the odds. The best bit of the love story is when EVE recounts her surveillance tapes and witnesses WALLE truly caring. The film looks great, sounds great and taps into contemporary issues whilst piling on some harmless pop culture for kicks. What more could you ask for from a 21st Century feature animation?",8,0,2,11 April 2009
The Terminal," A good film overall but still rather weak in a few places.
","The Terminal is a good film that is funny, entertaining and deals with some good ol' fashioned drama situations. It felt very much like a documentary at times, maybe due to the fact it's based on a true story from the 1980's, but that didn't retract from the enjoyment factor. To say it's a story all about the trials and tribulations of just one man is perhaps a little too shallower way to sum it up but at certain times, you do wonder if the film's going anywhere. Such it is that the film DOES contain a few laughable moments adding to its comedy tag.These come at certain intervals and everything in-between is just 'filla'. So there are some good, comic moments but in my opinion, there aren't as many 'funny' parts to make you laugh all the way through. The film deals with 'slapstick' humour in parts such as slipping over a wet floor or walking into a window. It's those sort of moments that do sort of distract from the film slightly.Some of the stories within the film also feel generally annoying in the sense of the point of them being there. The film was supposed to be about one man (Hanks) I thought, NOT solely about anyone else and so I was rather surprised to see the little story about the food/cafeteria delivery worker attempting to get one of the other airport workers to fall in love with him. Things like that were flawed and distracted from the actual film. As I said before, that particular story line acted as a 'filla'; a way of upping the film length and it was disappointing.Hanks' acting is good and although his accent was terribly annoying early on, I managed to adjust accordingly and with stand it all the way through. The character 'Gupta' is also rather amusing; using the simple concept of forcing people to slip up on his own polished floor merely for his amusement was rather odd- odd but funny none-the-less. Zeta-Jones' character and performance was also 'tolerable'. She wasn't in the film much I didn't notice but it's a good feeling when you realize Hanks has someone to really relate to as you stat to feel as if your feeling sorry for Hanks if you get into it too much and the acting from Zeta- Jones is some relief at least.All in all I think you'll enjoy 'The Terminal' if you're the patient type. It's got a bit of humour, a bit of tragedy, a hint of romance and some moments where you'll really feel good for the characters as they finally get what they want after the last half an hour or so was probably built up to 'will it/they or won't it/they' not to mention the film itself on Hanks' struggle with staying in the airport.",7,1,2,30 September 2004
The Cannonball Run," Cynical and rather ordinary feature that has nothing going for it bar the novelty value of seeing all these names and faces on screen at once.
","The Cannonball Run was worse than I thought it might have been; a wax-work museum of yester-decade stars of the previous generation, mugging their way through a plot-less, rather humourless, but pro-consumerist and recklessness road movie during which its characters start at point 'A'; physically travel through to point 'Z' but basically end up right where they began in terms of everything else. It must've been a sad moment, back in the day, when children, young adults and seasoned adults alike were watching their past/current heroes in the form of Dean Martin; Sammy Davis Jr; Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore engaging in nothing more than tired pastiches; slapstick comedy and acting as pawns for advertisements.The film doesn't even deliver on what it promises in the form of a race of some kind. The opening is overly long; too talky and takes too much time establishing what are essentially either clichés or archetypes, while for all the talk and build up of the race, it's essentially nothing more than a rare series of pratfalls and incidences in which in order to laugh, you have to find either speeding cars; women in revealing outfits or persons impersonating those of a medical profession, funny. In a bizarre change of tact towards the end, there is a mass-brawl between the racers and a load of bikers; the leader of which is Peter Fonda who I guess is sending up his Easy Rider role, which just sees the film throw its hands up and announce that: 'Yes, we've finally run out of ideas'.The Cannonball Run gets across its highly unmotivated and desperate sense of the sheer spectacle to act as a means of laughter, very early on, when two characters whom are the closest we have to anything at all resembling 'leads', land an aeroplane in the middle of a public street, run into a shop and buy beer before taking off again. The characters are J.J. McClure (Reynolds) and Victor Prinzim (DeLuise), two people that later acquire a van, disguise it as an ambulance, kidnap a woman, bung her in the back and pretend to be off somewhere where she can receive help – and they're the one's we're supposed to root for. Along for the ride is Jack Elam's doctor, named Nikolas Van Helsing; an incompetent and slurring individual who's the victim of one of the film's many re-occurring gags; that being that he has an odd looking face and that if we crash zoom in onto it to some mock-horror organ music now and again, everyone will laugh. Another rather sad, tragic even, ingredient to this quartet is DeLuise's character's habit of donning a cape and mask; from whence he brandishes them from, I'm not sure; and breaking off into bizarre, mock-super hero skits complete with his own fan-fare sound effects. While everyone else watches on and, I'm sure, laughs their heads off; I actually found it quite sad to watch.Partaking in the race, a journey from Connecticut to California, are a number of names and faces doing it purely for kicks. Jackie Chan and Michael Hui are the more technologically-advanced-than-anyone-else-Japanese, although they themselves are Chinese and according to what I read, they speak Cantonese on a Japanese TV show when selected for the race. They exist solely to provide advertising for Subaru. Then we have Roger Moore, a man playing a character named Seymour Goldfarb, Jr.; who's a send up of his James Bond character, a role he still occupied at the time of shooting. His inclusion reminds me of a recent time when the producers took years and years to make a sequel to 1998's The Mask of Zorro, while in the meantime Banderas, who played the role of Zorro, sent up the character in 2004's Shrek 2 by way of voicing Puss in Boots. A year after that film, a sequel was actually made, entitled The Legend of Zorro, with Banderas once again back in the role. No, hang on. A year ago you were creating a pastiche and sending up this character for the comic creation it was. Now you've gone back to it and you're making heaps of money in the process out of, what is essentially, something you've already discarded as a joke. Moore in The Cannonball Run fits exactly this situation. He sends the thing up in a tired spoof, then goes back to it for consequent Bond films Octopussy and A View to a Kill. Suddenly we're supposed to forgive and forget? I don't think so. Was it not the case that after The Cannonball Run, everyone got on Moore's back over his Bond role? Then you've got the slack-jawed Southerners; the typically rich, eccentric Arabs in the form of Jamie Farr's Sheik plus the jewellery-clad African-Americans, all of whom are partaking. Where does it all lead? Well, it leads to a glut of Goodyear tyres and Camel cigarettes product placement, while at one point, DeLuise is relegated to that of a performance chimp as he dances in front of the camera and sings a Dr Pepper jingle; seconds after it ends, the film restarts again with Reynolds walking back into shot ready to spout the next line of dialogue that'll move everyone on to the next pratfall. It's a shame that so many people have taken to this; like with most films of this ilk, I'm tempted to say that when people come to re-view The Cannonball Run, they're reviewing their childhoods and how happy they were when they first saw the film as opposed to how good it is as a stand alone piece. But with a distinctly leery sensibility at times; a running theme of total disregard to superiors and authoritarian figures, such as the law enforcement, plus every highway code rule broken under the pretence of 'We're having fun', The Cannonball Run burns out pretty quickly after the starter's gun goes off.",5,1,2,29 August 2009
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Ruminations on cultural integrity is the theatre in 'Birdman', a triumph of style and substance.
","Actually, I WAS vaguely aware of the fact Farrah Fawcett died the same day as Michael Jackson - if not aware the same day, then certainly the same week: I also recall actor David Carradine dying at around the same time. Did you know that renowned English author Aldous Huxley died on the same day as John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas? Reading 'Love, Poverty and War', a compendium of articles by an Anglo-American journalist, just recently, and with this very review in my mind, I learnt that C.S. Lewis died on this exact same day in 1963 as well. Eerie.Such historical items of interest are at the core of 'Birdman' - a delicious 2014 film by Mexican director Alejandro Iñárritu which is about what we consider to be worthwhile, with a particular emphasis on the world of art and culture. Nearer the end of the film, the lead of the piece, Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), points out the Fawcett/Jackson coincidence, but bleakly noted that it was Jackson who got most of the publicity - as if Fawcett didn't matter. Within the universe of the film, Riggan only recently came through a plane-set emergency which happened to have George Clooney on board too - had it crashed, Riggan theorises that his own demise would have been swept under the rug for full coverage of Clooney's, and that terrifies him...Trying to capture in a few words precisely how it feels to watch 'Birdman' is difficult - the best I can do is that it is a little like 'The Player' meets 'Inland Empire'; its technical and aesthetical triumphs are to be marvelled at, but the film is so much more than a mere exercise in style - it has an interesting and intelligent hypothesis; it is attempting to say something; its characterisation is crisp and engaging. Having watched it twice in a week, I still came away feeling like I could see it a hundred more times and not pick up on absolutely everything: the significance of the red and blue lighting which interchangeably illuminate various scenes; whether there is any evidence either way to suggest various dream/telekinetic sequences are really happening; why seemingly random compositions of comets soaring through our atmosphere are important...In a ramshackle theatre somewhere in New York City, Riggan Thomson (pronounced 'ray-gun') is directing and performing in an adaptation of an old play by Raymond Carver. He is consumed by doubt over its worthwhileness; staring monetary troubles square in the face and slowly being consumed by a developing schizophrenia. Years earlier, he was a fictitious superhero named Birdman for three films and grossed millions - now wracked by guilt for making money off the back of cheap entertainment, he attempts to pour his efforts into something more artistic. A scattered soul, he confuses the names of backstage staff he's been seeing for weeks; openly admits to his disgust for contemporary culture ('bad parents raise Justin Bieber'); does his best to keep his rebellious daughter Sam (Emma Stone) in check and must learn to work with a new actor played by Edward Norton, who carries with him his own challenges.Embedded at the core of Riggan's existence is the irony that he will, in actual fact, ALWAYS be remembered within the confines of audio-visual culture anyway: as the man who played a superhero in a set of films everybody enjoyed. And yet, he is desperate to go down as somebody who did something else. Mirroring the film in a particularly uncanny way, so much so that one can never shake the sensation for the duration of the movie, is the fact Keaton himself played Batman in two films before largely disappearing from major the mainstream cinematic canon, only to now pop up in work like this for Iñárritu.The film uses the confines of Riggan's mind to play out the war between high and low culture; of style vs. substance - the internal dialogue Riggan's increasingly antsy alter-ego forces him to have with himself provides us with the essay Iñárritu is attempting to convey in oral form. The argument is not delivered subtly, but with a series of jabs scattered throughout - the first of which occurs in the very first scene wherein Riggan is reminded that a large pay-cheque might have been his if only he'd opted to star in a crappy reality TV show rather than spend thousands on a play for a smaller audience. At its most aggressive, the film resorts to depicting an imaginary scenario straight out of a blockbuster whereby a huge alien bird attempts to destroy the city - a sequence so jarring, it reminds us that what we have seen to this point has appeared to be one unbroken take.The internal war Riggan has with himself is, of course, a battle spilling out into the rest of the world: 'fame' now consists of going viral on the Internet; the 'worst' films make the most money; reading or attending the theatre are niche pursuits and nobody over the age of 17 seems to like any of the music we have nowadays. Lindsay Duncan's character, a merciless critic who hates modern films even more than Riggan, is afforded the duty to outline this with the best line in the film. 'Birdman' seems to allow Sam to be the embodiment of this brave new epoch: she is pessimistic; smokes weed and wonders what on Earth possessed her father to pour all this energy into adapting Carver anyway - their confrontation is inevitable, and Riggan has no real answer to any of her points, inferring that resistance is futile.What conclusions doe the film reach? 'Birdman' opens with a quotation that to feel 'beloved on Earth' is to fulfil a good life - there is nothing in there about the quality of your output, while the film's subtitle even seems to conclude that ignorance is a virtue, albeit and unexpected one. I guess raising Justin Bieber makes you a good parent after all...",8,0,0,17 December 2018
Platoon," Very strong war film that deals with not only the physical horrors of war but the psyche and masculinity challenges the soldiers face.
","Don't let any thing anyone says about this film fool you for Platoon has broken my top 50 and has very quickly etched its way into my list I have at the back of my mind detailing my favourite films in the war genre. A conclusion I came to when watching Platoon and something that is echoed during new recruit Chris Taylor (Sheen) in one of his voiceovers is that the real enemy is indeed the one from within your own side; the conflict that is going on within a band of people all attempting to prove how macho each other can be over the others: disagreements over authority is a common re-occurrence. This made me make a connection to how American's at home took to the Vietnam War at the time ie; they didn't like what they were seeing and hearing thus; were also against what was happening. The voice of authority is being heard and causing problems not only in the film's platoon but also on the homeland as people complain.While this is just scratching the surface when it comes to dealing with the film's theme, Platoon on its own is a brilliantly well crafted; atmospheric and engaging film that shocks and pulls at your emotional strings with haunting music and issues that surround war. War is not merely two sides fighting in a jungle/desert/town but in-between battles it's about relations with your comrades; dealing with civilians and sorting out the messes that your squad encounter and I love it when war films deal with this subject matter. Platoon wastes no time in introducing itself: the ramp comes down to unveil new supposed cannon fodder as previous dead GIs are carried off. 'Welcome to the 'Nam.' jibes a soldier. But Platoon is more than fancy film-making; it's a film made by Oliver Stone who knows what's what when it comes to Vietnam: Taylor is fighting for a society back home; a belief that Vietnam (and the rest of the world) shouldn't fall to Communism and it's a society that will ultimately reject him and his actions as it will all the soldiers: 'F***ing politics' says one character on multiple occasions which acts as a substitute for 'S*** happens' only the guy is forced to be made aware of the predicament he's in and now cannot dismiss where he is and what he's doing in a carefree manner.I feel the best scenes in Platoon are not necessarily the fight scenes although they're still impressive. Platoon deals with the immediate 'just before' and immediate aftermath of gunfights. One such scene during which Taylor experiences the Vietcong for the first time is a good example: it's night, quiet and Taylor is the only one awake: he looks down a corridor of jungle and sees figures move towards him. Such a scene is shot using Taylor's POV, the reaction of his eyes and the close up of his head as he is frozen in fear, half putting is hood on. Such an atmospheric piece of film-making really puts you in the zone and briefly; I was there with Taylor in that clearing. Coming from Stone, a veteran; is the portrayal of Vietnam as a place where it's not just the gunfights that are terrible: Sheen narrates his letters to his Grandmother, not his parents showing a further emphasis of being cut off; that he has to dig all the time  he hates it in a week. Taylor must also face ants and mosquito's as well as emptying the toilets with fellow soldiers: the gunfights just seem like the filler in-between all the other crap. That is, after all, what they're there for.Platoon also uses a scene during which the squad encounter a village to good effect. One reason I loved Apocalypse Now so much was the fact it moves the action away from the jungle and onto a river but they still encounter seemingly innocent people on a transport boat. In Platoon, the village is a substitute for the boat as seemingly innocents are searched and harmed in the aim to find something they can pin them for. Needless to say, both film's characters have dealt with loss very recently and are foaming at the mouth in search of revenge. While reminiscent of Soviet film Come and See, the village scene is an actual liquidation and contains, arguably, the film's most disturbing scene when a villager is shot and the rest of the family react in the way they do. A scene involving Taylor and a supposed execution challenges a soldiers psyche: 'talking the talk and walking the walk' since all Vietnamese are apparently the enemy, surely all of them must die at first time of asking. Taylor has that chance with a cripple and Sergeant Barnes (Berenger) has that chance with a little girl but his actions and macho image clash with his psyche thus putting himself in an eerie position which is very clever and involving film-making.With its portrayal as Vietnam as a place that is not just guns, death and dying but including that as an emotional trigger; Platoon spreads its character development and interaction in a fantastic way whilst remaining real and violent with enough scenes to either have you evoking an emotion of some sort: anger, sadness, relief or any other along those lines. With a great soundtrack and enough content to truly put anyone off going to war, Platoon must remain in any war genre cannon as well as be used as an example of film-making.",9,1,2,31 December 2007
Prometheus," Back to the beginning and back to basics, sort of, with Ridley Scott delivering an Alien prequel of some worth.
","For whatever reason, I cannot quite say whether or not I love 'Prometheus' as a piece of awe-inspiring science fiction; merely appreciate it as a decent bit of B-movie story-telling, or ultimately feel it is lacking in too many departments to really like at all. It is a curious place to be, made more-so by the fact I have seen the film a number of times over the course of about two years, and do not seem to tire of it; yet, would in no way describe it as a personal favourite.I hold no absolute brief for 1979's 'Alien', nor its 1986 sequel, though I enjoyed both of them tremendously. I am not the sort of person who owns little models of characters and creatures from the franchise so that I might perch them on my shelf or desk; my bookcases are not lined with comics related to the series. I do not fawn over the 'lore' of these particular films, nor feel personally violated if something is added to it which is of a markedly poor stature - I come to something like 'Prometheus' with a clean slate in this respect.On the one hand, Ridley Scott's 2012 prequel to the series he initiated with the aforementioned 'Alien' is a rollicking, and particularly good-looking, genre-movie whereby a crew of people explore a barren planet deep into space and find more than they bargained for. On the other, it is a piece of some considerable stature which looks at the role of religion in our world and what it means to be human at all: a contemplative piece about ideas and that all-too-rare animal, a 'event' movie with scope. In the end, I think it quenches enough of either stall without settling for being too much of one or the other - there exist far more complex-a science fiction films, yet this is a long way from mere standard fare.'Prometheus' opens on Earth at what is, it later transpires, the moment life itself began. We begin with a montage of prehistoric vistas, a recurring image of which is the ground itself which seems to conspicuously harbour artery-like patterns. A muscular being, slightly akin to a human in appearance, consumes something which has a wretched effect on his well-being, causing him to collapse into a nearby river, terminating everything including his DNA strands. When this is all outlined to characters later on, one of them berates it for ignoring centuries of Darwinism; the joke here, I think, that Darwin estimated life began in water to some extent anyway.Millennia later, in 2089, an archaeological dig involving our eventual protagonist Shaw (Noomi Rapace), and her partner in both life and work Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), sees them uncover ancient cave paintings, from which it is staggeringly deduced that the interplanetary beings of the opening have left a message asking humans to come and visit them. Not long after, we are back on familiar territory; this discovery acting as the cue for a team of scientists under the auspices of the Weyland Corporation to blast off to LV-223 (crucially, NOT the locality from 'Alien') to find both the creators of life on our planet and the answers to tough questions: Why were we made? What is our purpose? Where do the creators themselves come from?The film finds a healthy place between being far away enough from 'Alien' without replicating it, but not too far so as to feel totally detached. There is a decent amount of both creature-feature and body-horror element, but the piece has its own story to tell - its own axe to grind. Like 'Alien', a droid, in Michael Fassbender's David, is present, although unlike 'Alien', it is made obvious to us much sooner. Twists and narrative reveals play a role in later events; there are some genuinely unpleasant moments, but it is not a freak show.The film is driven by Rapace's character. We are made aware of her sticky history with religion; bereavement and faith, something which has consumed her enough to seek those who seemingly made us. What is at stake is not death by monster, although that sort of thing does rear up, but her own spiritual well-being in her unquenchable thirst for answers: the exterior threat in this instance being the spectre of an existential black-hole.Her partner, Holloway, is fairly poorly written, but David, wonderfully portrayed, is sinister without being evidently malevolent - there is a certain efficient coldness in the way he sinks basketball shots and speaks to himself in mirrors during the voyage whilst the crew sleep. Devilishly, the mission briefing which unfolds at the end of act one does so via a hologram on a basketball court, a locality emblematic of a fast-flowing contest between two sides which, you might say, alludes to later events.The film contains two sequences I thought a bit beneath Ridley Scott. The first sees two crew members run off at the sight of a 2000 year old carcass, but stop to pet a cobra-like creature which evidently does not want to be touched. The second is the behaviour of certain crew members in a dust storm when an item, which you feel would still be there after the weather, is dropped mere feet from the ship's entrance. The debris of the storm would almost certainly have smashed their helmets as they go out to get it. It is compensated by a later scene in a medical capsule, where a calm robotic voice juxtaposes the sheer panic of the situation and we are made to feel very uneasy.Otherwise, I would conclude that 'Prometheus' delivers. Ultimately, its religious symbolism is subtly woven in, so that blank 'white' spaces behind characters shot at high angles infer nothingness (or newfound atheism) once their crucifixes have been removed from them. These are consequently much more than just fancy-looking camera shots, and convey meaning. This, and more, is reason to see the film.",7,0,0,8 June 2020
Halloween," Horror, suspense, chase, violence and a now iconic villain; it has to be Halloween.
","Two people are sitting in a room at a table with a bomb underneath it: it explodes  that is action. Two people sit in a room at a table with a bomb underneath it: it doesn't explode  that is suspense. Wise words from, I believe, Alfred Hitchcock who was a master at suspense and really moved the horror genre on as a whole from those pre-1960s monster movies that Hollywood churned out to a hungry, teenage drive-in audience. A couple of decades later and John Carpenter is using the same idea: there is a young female teenager alone in a house with a knife wielding maniac outside: he runs in a stabs her  that is horror. The girl is inside and the knife wielding maniac is watching her through the window: that is suspense.That is the essence of Halloween, John Carpenter's 1978 fright filled horror film that absolutely drowns in suspense in a fantastic sort of a way. It's an easy thing to do, I suppose, to just get a load of horny teenagers on screen and have them picked off one by one: no brains, no suspense, no script and no fun from a theoretical point of view. Alas, modern horrors fall foul of this trap with recent efforts Freddy vs. Jason and from what I've heard; Jason X being two of many culprits. Halloween is a much more sophisticated horror in fact it rivals The Shining for the most suspense filled, un-nerving horror film of all time in my opinion at least. But where Kubrick had money, a location that was uncanny in its symmetry and eeriness and a real license to unleash the supernatural in his film; Halloween takes everything a level lower and uses camera work, setting and dialogue to build up its scares.The first hour of Halloween is basically one long build up of 'is he, isn't he' (going to strike) and 'is she, isn't she' (going to die). The actual opening of Halloween is probably the best use of a long take in any film I've ever seen; funny how another Kubrick film pops into mind in the form of A Clockwork Orange but that was more one long shot than one long take since the camera was static as it zooms out. Halloween gets its priorities right: Michael Myers is talked about by Dr. Loomis (Pleasence), his psychiatrist for 15 years, in a way that makes him seem unnatural  Michael is off screen as Loomis goes on and on about how dangerous and insane he his creating a dangerous persona of a character who is miles and miles away from said actions. The certain events that follow such as the grave digging and the stealing of knifes from a general shop also creates a foreboding atmosphere centring on Myers without him even being there.It's also worth saying that Laurie Strode (Lee Curtis) is a girl that doesn't seem to 'fit in' with the other girls: when they're having sex, she's babysitting; when they smoke they smoke properly but when Laurie does so, she chokes and just doesn't seem as outgoing as the rest of them in general  needless to say those that do conform to society meet grizzly ends: a horror genre convention we all know of by now. Halloween gets is characters and its delivery bang on but it also plays with its audience. There are enough phones ringing, foreboding compositions with Myers looming in the background and character going from one place to another and then back again to create suspense and some genuine jumps; this twinned with the fact the lights always seem to be off makes for great viewing.Halloween is a film that is clever and taught but it suffers very sparsely from perhaps its look and the dated way it goes about having its character react. Loomis and his accomplice seem fine about getting out of a car despite the fact mental patients have escaped and are loose; Laurie also fails to finish off Myers on one occasion towards the end when she had a chance to. Laurie also decides that hiding in a wardrobe might be a good idea when Myers still looms and yet refuses to break a window in order to escape until he is literally feet away from her. Whatever Halloween has wrong with it can actually be covered up to look like more suspense and at least it doesn't become a mere gore-fest. The final shots of various locations after Myers has seemingly been beaten could be point of view shots of Myers as he does his thing; could be revisits to the locations of murder or maybe something else entirely. My guess is the point of view option since you hear him breathing. If you're looking for a suspenseful, violent at times film that delivers on jumps, chase and enough phallic stabbing to get any psychoanalytic fan in a flush then you will want to give Halloween a go.",8,0,1,5 November 2007
Back to the Future Part II," Genuinely exhilarating science fiction film, whose leaps in tone are handled well; whose characterisation is pleasing and whose sense of adventure is infectious.
","I don't think that the first Back to the Future sequel is ultimately much more than an energising romp through the past; the then-present and the then distant future – an episode in the lives of certain characters during which they must spontaneously react to a predicament and shoot off to try and deal with it in whatever way they can, systematically hopping to and from various eras in the process to formulate an adventure. Indeed, the film's disconnection from the franchise's other two entries lies with the fact the time machine is as much a feature in Part II as anything else compared to the first and third films; the characters therein darting off to varying times on varying equilibriums as opposed to bedding down at a set date and allowing an adventure to play out. Furthermore, it is the only film in the series without a slam-bang finale consisting of racing against time (so to speak) with the potential peril of missing getting back to a specific year at stake – ending here on a cliff hanger merely teeing up the next entry, thus alluding to proceedings as 'filler' or as an entry detailing an episode or two instead of a rounded adventure. Regardless, the piece works rather well.The film kicks off following the conclusion of the first, the lead in Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, and his newfound idyllic existence post-adventure with a functioning family; enthusiastic girlfriend Jennifer (Shue) and new vehicle shattered by the arrival of his long-standing partner in time Emmett Brown (Lloyd), nicknamed Doc. Doc arrives via the time machine in a frenzied and panicked manner; he has journeyed, as he said he would at the death of the first, far into the future and arrived back to inform Marty and his spouse-to-be that their future children are in big trouble. His outlining of the severity of the situation runs hand in hand with his erratic demeanour and frenzied actions, clearly in a state at the situation thus heightening tension. He speaks whilst systematically refuelling the time machine with household waste, inferring great time has to have been spent completely remodelling the contraption and its power source, a complicated procedure reiterating what a fantastic brain the man is in this respect.After being whisked away and thrust up into air, The Delorean now with the capability of flying, the opening credits greet us with a continual shot that resembles the perspective of an aeroplane's nosecone as it flies through the sky – a continual composition echoing that of the perspective those within the Delorean might see had the trips for those therein not been instantaneous. Arriving in 2015, Doc outlines Marty's mission in that frenzied manner; the arrival into an eerie new world and the highlighting of what's at stake doing well to further tension as it's established whom he's going up against is the 2015 equivalent to being 'a couple of beers short of a six-pack', only here involving that of circuit boards. It's said the police and judicial systems work with brutal efficiency, but very little in the way of law is around to break up what is aggravated assault in a diner between Griff (Wilson), Biff's grandson, and Marty, which spills out into the streets and sees him pose as his son to try and quell a future jail term.The film begins in earnest when McFly buys a sports results booklet detailing who will win certain sporting events in the next several decades, for that when he journeys back to his present, he may earn a little extra cash. The idea is hit upon by Doc, demonised and then dismissed before Biff, now as an old man, emerges from the fire exit to a nearby establishment as if some kind of ghostly figure having overheard before taking it upon himself to deliver the book to himself as a youngster man through the Delorean's capabilities. He does so, 1985 Hill Valley eventually re-branded a Las Vegas-inspired, Civil war-torn iconography clad Hell in which Biff rules on high. Here, Biff is Marty's step-father and the consistent pulsating grinds out-poured by background power stations act as ambiguously diegetic sound effects whirring away, neatly capturing the horror of the situation Marty finds himself in; a situation poor Marty needs to have explained to him because 'they' hit him on the head 'harder than usual', this time.Thus begins all manner of rather enthralling hijinks, the film undercut with a real sense of both danger and horror as these people toy with time and end up in less than glamorous scenarios; the allure of time travel rife amidst these people and encapsulated in Marty's reaction to peering long-fully down an alleyway towards a busy street in 2015 Hill Valley, wanting to get amongst the residents of the world thirty years on but eventually brought down to Earth with what it is he experiences there-on. On one occasion, Jennifer ends up in her own home thirty years on; the presence of her future daughter mingling around in the background, and in the elevated position of upstairs, complied as if an unearthly creature milling around in a the background of a horror film sequence. Robert Zemeckis directs proceedings with a certain guile, taking the film to some pretty harrowing places on top of some goofy ones that encompasses horse feces and slapstick comedy; yet able to manoeuvre around when a change in tone is required and things become blacker, if more dangerous. Marty and Doc's adventures through the ages ultimately feels a little superficial, if well put together for what it is; but the flip side to this is that if said characters are those of whom we adorn as much as we do and whose company is so pleasing, then what's the problem with spending another 'x' number of hours-and-a-bit minutes in the presence of them and their madcap, rip-roaring misadventures through time and space? My answer: absolutely nothing whatsoever.",7,1,3,15 June 2011
Carrie," Relentless and often tough film hybridising these ingredients of coming of age; family relations and high-school drama to really good effect..
","It would be fair to say that the titular character in Brian De Palma's Carrie is in no way leading a 'normal' life at the precious, delicate stage she is. True to theory, De Palma inter-cuts between two scenes encapsulating the varied natures of what might constitute as ordinary teen-aged behaviour with what it is that our lead must go through at precisely the same time. The two scenes see school bully Sue (Irving), and what appears to be a standard night OUT for her, placed up against a typical night IN for our Carrie, played with vulnerable relish by that of Sissy Spacek. Sue is of the young; athletic and confrontative sort. She sits beside boyfriend Billy upfront in the passenger seat as they cruise around in his car. They're in the middle of a sort of argument, but it's one of those squabbles which you know no matter how long it goes on, as long as it doesn't venture beyond a certain threshold of aggression, everything will remain sound by this time tomorrow. She's challenging him as they chug along when he raised the point that he'd quite like her to stop playfully insulting him, but she plugs away anyway.It's a scene demonstrating an exchange in power and an established dynamic between two characters being pulled and pushed back either way; a scene told alongside another that involves Carrie who's at home with her mother. Here is another instance involving a young girl bordering on the leaving of high school in which that person must engage in an established dynamic built on further exchanges of power, only this time with an icy and thoroughly religious woman whose idea of 'saving' Carrie is to stilt her growing out of childhood. Neither instance is necessarily that constructive in their overall breakdown, but I would take a guess that the one involving Sue and Billy best represents how 'typical' young women might be spending their evenings. Oh, to be able to engage in a natural back-and-forth whilst out and about in the side seat of a friend's car wherein you challenge the dominant force of a partner rather than remain shut away inside with that of an equal force engaging in strict mealtime processions and being forced into reading the bible whilst locked in a closet.Carrie's lives in America and attends a high-school with many other girls of her age, most of whom bully; berate and wind her up. The volleyball match opening the film suggests good, healthy competition amidst the girls - competitors go for shots and clearly enjoy the physical activity to De Palma's applied slow motion. The reality is quite the opposite when we reach the girl at the back in the corner doing her best to stay away from the action; it is Carrie and alas, one of the members on the other team no doubt spots the weak spot in Carrie's team's makeup in so much she provides her with something to do: specifically, make the crucial shot on match point. She blows it and the ugly scenes as Carrie is 'comiserated' by her teammates alludes to the bigger picture.Not so far away is Carrie's mother Margaret (Laurie), a preacher who goes from door to door attempting to spread her religious musings in a way which is at once all of enthusiastic and quite maddening. One occasion sees her turned away by those whom own the house she has just called upon, and we note how pleased they are to be rid of her. The film does not linger with this family and their, in comparison rather perfect, set up nor further detail them much. Instead, we track home with the fanatic and to her domestic situation; Carrie's school day in mind, one could feasibly say that it is the more pleasant-a half of her daily existence as when she gets home to her lone mother, things are cranked up a notch. De Palma utilises the incoming end of school prom night dance as a looming deadline, in turn transforming everything into a shrill, and at times agonised, low level drama which happens to mutate into domains of the uncanny when great levels of frustration and anger boil up.The film is essentially one big build up to the prank-of-all-pranks that the bullies, lead by the aforementioned Sue and her partner Billy, who himself isn't shy of getting stuck into a hair-raising situation when we observe him out drinking and driving at once with the verbal confirmation that police cars are buzzing around, aim to play on Carrie at the end of school dance. Prior to all of this, the film shoots Carrie purchasing a dress for the special evening to the same music that accompanied the rest of the girls engaging in gym class; a series of exercises making light of their sexuality to highly suggestive musical overtures. Carrie is unsure of the prom and unsure that she has the ability to share such a realm with that of the 'other' girls, but the use of the musical track as she attempts to burrow her way onto a level playing surface following one boy's asking of her to the dance suggests she is approaching achieving otherwise. In spite of its reputation and what it is people either predominantly know or remember it for, the film is a low-level American town character drama more than anything else and works really well to that degree and is something most certainly worth checking out.",7,3,5,2 February 2012
The Queen," And the rest, as they say, is history.
","The closing shots of The Queen will have you smiling, acknowledging the fact that what comes next in chronological history is what has shaped my country, England, in the last decade as Tony Blair (Sheen) and Queen Elizabeth the Second (Mirren) walk off together through her gardens. It'll have you smiling in recognition that what followed is part of history, part of a history you will have lived through and remembered; after all, what is ten years amongst the vast centuries of history? I think I had such a connection, such a link, to The Queen because Diana's death occurred at a time where I was not too young to remember it happen, nor was I too young to acknowledge how important an event it was. I will remember exactly where I was when I saw it on the morning news after another family member decided to turn on the television for the mere sake of it. I may have been too young to know exactly who Diana was but the general consensus that something truly terrible had happened to someone who truly didn't deserve it was inescapable; the atmosphere and feel of that time is captured perfectly in this film by director Frears be it down to use of news coverage resurrecting nostalgic emotions deep within me or merely down to the mise-en-scene used in the form of props: then England manager Glenn Hoddle on the back of a newspaper and a Sony Playstation complete with games and controller in view at various points.I recently saw a film entitled JFK which I learnt after seeing was also Oscar nominated for best picture in its respective year. Like JFK, all the British will remember where they were and what they were doing when they learnt of Diana's death  it was an event that hit the American's like Kennedy's death, I'm sure. I think I enjoyed JFK at the level I did because of this film, since it brings out feelings of nostalgia and sadness at once; sort of like the feeling you might get when you look at a photograph of a deceased loved one. The Queen as a film manages to remain extremely authentic, mainly down to its mise-en-scene mentioned earlier, without feeling too much like a send up or a spoof; people who have ever seen an episode of Spitting Image or one of Rory Bremner's Tony Blair impersonations will know what I mean. What can be funny in The Queen is strictly kept to a surreal and constructive level; there is the acknowledgment of memory that makes you smirk every now and again but there is also something rather amusing about watching apparent members of the royal family squabble over things like who wants to watch the television.I think there are several little coded undercurrent swimming around beneath The Queen's surface. First of all, we must remember what the film is entitled: it's called 'The Queen' despite its subject matter and extremely heavy emphasis on Lady Diana's death. To call Diana's death a 'MacGuffin' would perhaps be a too colloquial expression but the film brilliantly uses it as its backdrop to its events; rather than focus on setting or time, the film lets the found footage of the news and such to place you there rather than feed you establishing shots and crane shots scanning the vast locales of the film. Yes, notice how it is entitled The Queen and notice how it never allows Diana to take over as the focus for the film; it may be about her and her immediate aftermath but it is The Queen's and the royal family's reaction that will dictate where the film will go  Frears never allows the two to cross contaminate.Then there is Tony Blair to consider. Whilst brilliantly acted, there is more to his performance and character than it seems. Blair announces that he is the new deal; he is the ultimate piece of modernity in terms of politics and world leaders: young, laid back and with children old enough to go to school. 'Just call me Tony' is the way the expression goes, I believe. This is where the counterbalance occurs because for the duration of the film, Blair and the Queen are at loggerheads with one another with Blair frequently pointing out what it is he think the Royals should do but the Queen had none of it. Here is the old vs. the new; the modern vs. the traditional clashing at full stretch. This is further emphasised by the spaces they inherit: the royals are in fancy places with vast open rooms whereas Tony is in an office, sleeves rolled up and telling the Queen that he believes it to be 'his duty' to suggest such actions. The Queen Mother may think him a silly man but he is daring to challenge the binary opposite of himself in terms of power.The Queen is a clever film that will evoke emotion to some degree but will not have you crying your eyes out; it's clever like that. It will allow you nostalgia on a certain level but it will never bombard you, favouring etching out memory instead out and out tears before bedtime. What with an extremely authentic look, brilliant acting and a piece of iconography represented through a great stag as the Queen realises the value of life and what she must do when she sees it for a final time, the film is a big winner in almost every department.",8,2,3,24 January 2008
Blow," Strong anti-drug film that gets across its message with an emphasis on the wrongs rather than rights whilst allowing us to have our own opinion on the hero.
","The closing captions of Blow give us some information about how tragic George Jung's (Played in the film by Johnny Depp) life had now become through loss of family and access to loved ones after the film's events have culminated; this suggests to me that we are, overall, supposed to feel sorry for the character even if it is difficult to given how he has something, everything, nothing, something again and then ultimately nothing  well, nothing good anyway unless you count mental illness and hallucinations as a good thing.There can be no denying that Blow owes a lot to 1983's Scarface but whilst that was fictitious and the events that transpire in Blow happened before it was made; the look, feel and general atmosphere of Blow will tangle you up in its narrative and lure you in to a world of drugs, glamour, seedy characters, dizzying highs and deathly lows. What is very important and what makes Blow, in my opinion, a particularly large success is that it doesn't concentrate on the dizzying highs for long enough for the activities on show to be glamorised or encouraged. Instead, Blow focuses on its protagonist's lows and how terrible life can be when you get mixed up in drugs; weather using or dealing. Scarface is of course famous for its message reiterated in the film: 'Don't get high on your own supply' and the result of Tony Montana hammers this home. Here in Blow, the tragedy and the all time low that hits home at the very end is another important and powerful message that is delivered through slick and engaging film-making.Blow makes it apparent that it's giving off the wrong impression rather early on but successfully back tracks later on. The notion that George's parents' own failure mainly contributed to his own rise and rise is brave enough to put across but the idea that after going to prison for the first time; in order to obviously be corrected, he comes out a stronger and more dangerous man  educated in the field of drugs even more after working up a plan with the wrong sort of person society really didn't want him to meet. I suppose the state would've thought putting a drug dealer and a carjacker together would've been a safe thing but Diego (Molla) is anything but a safe guy and it is not long before George is back out and dealing; this time bigger and better whilst breaking parole a little too often.But here is where Blow focuses on the lows more than the good times. It seems obligatory that just when everything seems perfect and made that stereotypical drug law enforcers would break down the doors and take everything away but that is what happens here; more importantly, it's what happened in real life. We are drawn to George because he's so appealing and seemingly smart in his ideas and execution that we do perhaps forgive him when it occurs to us that he is too stupid to realise when he is so far ahead, he doesn't just quit. Indeed, after stating that he is out forever much later on; he cannot help but do one final job in order to be able to set up a new life for him and his loved family member he technically plans on kidnapping. To say Blow is one of those obligatory drug films with use of the hierarchy and FBI agents that break down doors and put the anti-hero through hell is too harsh-a thing to say. There are times when you do perhaps switch off and allow the film's narrative to take you where it wants to go and that consists of montages of still images where we are given the impression time is passing as George goes places, meets people and engages in luxurious activity. This is twinned with the seemingly stereotypical characters such as the South American drug lords who will betray you for a 'few hundred thousand dollars and a couple of kilos' but I'm sure these sorts of people really exist and given the fact this is a true story, the film is not bogged down by these familiar scenes as well activity, lines of dialogue and characters.I think the film would like to think it is divided into two segments. There are highs and lows throughout that are cleverly spaced in-between jail terms that make him a worse person when it should be correcting him but the marriage to his wife Mirtha (Cruz) opens up the final tin that pushes the film to its climax and those heart wrenching titles. It seems all George wanted was someone to love but do we pity him or question his sanity when Mirtha leaves her own fiancé just to marry George upon a 'love at first sight' glance? I suppose if all George wanted was someone to love and the fact his first marriage didn't work out too well, it may be that he's desperate. He might've spotted Mirtha's eagerness to marry George pretty quickly and suspected foul behaviour but at this time, I doubt he cared. He states Mirtha is his perfect woman in a montage of S&M but slow the images down and it is Mirtha on the leash; playing the submissive role. This suggests he loves her as much as he does because he can control her, so when she suddenly becomes so independent and emotionally strong, it would seem he has been tricked. Blow is a film that entertains and engages in a respective manner without ever glamorising its anti-hero. Stand out performances from Depp and Cruz, who plays a character you really come to dislike over the duration of the film, merely sprinkle the icing on an entirely satisfying cake.",7,0,1,26 January 2008
1408," A homicidal room with a view.
","The idea behind 1408 is actually kind of cute; a sort of 'what if' scenario based on what might happen if an inanimate object was given life. We've all seen Child's Play and perhaps the less than desired sequels but here, the inanimate object given life and then forced to fall into the horror genre is a motel room  a neat and effective idea. Following on from other such Stephen King adaptations, 1408 adopts the approach of putting someone in an individual location and then allowing events to unfold around them without ever letting them leave: it can be a prisoner in The Shawshank Redemption in a prison; a crippled author trapped in a lodge in Misery or a haunted motel room you cannot escape from as seen here.1408 begins with an immediacy; a false immediacy that caught me off guard and worked really well. We get John Cusack's character Mike Enslin driving in the rain, at night and clearly lost  an easy, easy set up for a horror film but what follows is him finding the motel he was looking for, staying the night and leaving the next day in some disappointment  it is an anticlimax, for the character as well as for us as we have been led down a route of suspecting the film will begin its scares from the very off with a familiar set up before having everything cancelled and having the film cut to some bright, colourful shots of people surfing.But the subject matter and choice of editing is the secret here and it mirrors the idea the director has for the anti-climax. A dark, wet and 'spooky' for the genre night is juxtaposed for shots of the sea and surfers going about their business in bright sunshine. In fact the film goes on and has its ghost hunting author of the lead role state that he hasn't ever actually even seen a ghost, which further adds to the now dead and unsuspecting atmosphere the film has decided to lay onto us. It's these early mind-games and cancelling out what we take for granted that kicks the film off wonderfully well, setting up things to come.But Mike is drawn to a hotel called The Dolphin, and its infamous room 1408 from which the film gets its title. 1408 is a doomed, cursed room that keeps its inhabitants and renders them insane over time by basically erasing them from the face of the Earth; either that or erasing the face of the Earth around them so that the room and the individual are the only things that seem to exist. But while the film is not flawless, the exchanges and that initial thirty to forty minute trip once inside the room has more than enough ammunition to label this a successful horror film. The pleasantries and the introductions are done in a very urgent and dismissive manner; hotel hot-shot Gerald Olin (Jackson) doesn't build the room up prior to entry in a 'be careful' or a 'it's dangerous' mannerism but goes the whole hog and simply tells Mike it's a death trap and he will not survive, period.The funny thing is that we have no reason to believe anything that initially happens in room 1408 is really all that bad. The film has given us a series of scenes prior to the main course of a night in 1408 that do not have anything to do with the horror genre, at least not conventionally: they consist of a beach scene where people surf; a public book signing and a scene in which the lead character checks their mail  how many horror films would usually have their lead check their mail before heading off for the film's main plot strand? But this is what's clever about 1408, the 'scares' at the early stage consist of window's accidentally shutting on the individual's hand; taps breaking off and spraying water everywhere and the alarm radio randomly coming on to the tune of The Carpenters.So these events could just be coincidence, indeed even Mike comes to the conclusion he has been drugged through the whiskey and complimentary mint after all the fancy build up and is imagining it all, he and us have good reason to believe it could all be fake. One of the other reasons 1408 works is because of its protagonist and how strong and independent they are  the hero here is not some teenager whose reason to exist is so that they can be chased by a knife wielding maniac, Mike is a smart man who seeks these sorts of situations down and indeed uses several methods to calm himself down when everything feels a little too real  he is rational and realistic.Although the best bit about 1408 is what you might come to realise afterwards in the sense it could be a metaphorical journey for Mike given what revelations and problems arise, to do with domestic issues, later on. 1408 is his purgatory where he is forced to confront his past demons; it's a metaphor for coming to terms with what happened and who he is, especially after so many monotonous mis-fires in this job as an author. 1408 is a creepy and unnerving film that also comes across as quite smart. In my view, a success.",7,10,12,7 September 2008
Raging Bull," The film is brutal and brutally honest in equal measure; a terrifically terrifying slice of hard edged drama featuring a number of talents quite arguably at their peak.
","We begin with the titular Raging Bull gearing up before a contest, not one inside of ring but just prior to one of his stage duels in which he takes on the audience telling stories and anecdotes that pull in the crowds and the money. The man is Robert De Niro 's Jake La Motta; it's 1964, and after the brief practising of several lines to himself speaking of how he remembers every hit and every knock down and practically every detail of his in-ring boxing career, we dart back to 1941 to where it all began. With the benefit of hindsight, we're able to recall a number of other characters portrayed by De Niro in other Scorsese films in the form of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, and the memorable monologues they brought about, before arriving at the conclusion this character we're observing here and now for the first time may very well be as disturbed as the other two in said examples. When La Motta speaks, there's a sense of specificity or intrinsics about the man's verbal confirmation of living his boxing life to the full, and the ability to take in the more minute details of what unravelled in the ring; Martin Scorsese's film eventually coming to resemble an inmost and often distressingly intrinsic study of this man's life from his young adult years to entering old age.Scorsese doesn't doubt as to whether La Motta was a champion, without Scorsese's film one might champion him as a magnificent physical specimen and a champion athlete, but the manner as to which La Motta went about attaining this reputation, it seems and particularly at one point, sees him mercilessly hammer away at an opponent in a manner fuelled by hallucinations; scociopathic tendencies and mass hysteria that his wife, a long suffering Vickie (Moriarty) 'likes' the man he's fighting. But the film is as much a tale of the man outside of the ring as it is a tale of the man inside; how he came to be as aggressive and ruthlessly efficient as he was and how balancing that duality between an on-stage and off-stage persona through his aggression and anger became blurred and difficult to balance out. Raging Bull's immediate opening is a tranquil, beautiful almost, passage of slow motion as La Motta occupies the ring alone to some angelic music; that sense of it being of the picturesque sort and that La Motta truthfully belonged in the ring amidst everything else comes to feel prominent. In and around the scuzzy living of New York in whatever year, as the loitering with the sorts of people La Motta hangs with features more and more, the locale or space of the boxing ring comes to represent a very harmonious and very magnificent zone in which he totally finds his element and makes his name. It is a place of violence and often bloodshed, to La Motta through Scorsese's eyes, it was a small squared zone in which the lead was at one with himself.The film covers his life and times, his friends and foes; his wife and her hardships as well as his brother in Joey (Pesci), a man whom appears to be the only one capable of talking any degree of sense into the lead but additionally someone who has his own problems with violence and misogyny. When Jake first sees his wife to be, she's lounging beside a pool on a warm day under the careful watch of some local organised criminals; the very same ones La Motta had previously had a problem with in a local gym and whom verbally illustrate how they dealt with another man whom himself tried to woo young Vickie. La Motta, being the man he is, steps in regardless and thus instigates a relationship through casual small-talk and sessions of mini-golf.Vickie comes to represent the result of most of Jake's pent up rage, the immense paranoia twinned with gross levels of suspicion constantly threatening to destroy their coming together. At once, I criticised the film previously for not exploring their coming together enough and berated the lack of any substantial material believable enough to force them together. Viewing it again; it seems the film, in all its hostile ugliness, was always more concerned with how it was the lead tore their relationship apart what with his actions than it was ever interested in the stuff that borough them both harmoniously together. It is, however, the two brothers that the film produces some of the more magnificent moments of dialogue and exchange, a telling moment about where Scorsese's chief interests lie in the tale of Jake outside of the ring occurs during an instance in which he kisses his future wife on a date before moving off screen to further embrace. But the camera does not follow as one might expect, instead lingering on the mantle-piece that they were stood in-front of which now occupies the foreground upon which a photo of Joey and Jake together stands. The film here infers that the bond between the two brothers is the strongest of the film, if there is a stone-wall relationship between two people in the film, it is that of Jake and his brother; the reminding it is they whom argue and bicker and squabble like the couple they are.Raging Bull plays, for mostly all of its runtime, a lot like his 1973 film Mean Streets; the core change pushing it off down a very different framework that there happens to be a prize fighting boxer in and amongst the low-lives of which the film centralises on. The film is both peppered and undercut with a really uneasy sense of both hostility and hatred; Scorsese embedding the piece with a seething anger which you feel might just boil over and explode and any moment whereas the result is something highly substantial in a number of fields and most certainly worthy of seeking out.",8,2,3,5 February 2011
The Iron Giant," Really impressive and vastly superior to a lot of other animated films.
","I liked The Iron Giant, I liked it a lot. The film, surely, has to be recognised as one of the last, great two dimensional animated films that the Americans made at the back end of an era. If we formally acknowledge that the new 'era' of animation is, or was, from 1999 onwards predominantly three dimensional from an American perspective, then this is the last great film of that time. Here is an animated film that does not rely on purely the visual, even if they are as impressive as they need to be and opts for story telling and emotional involvement more than anything else. Sprinkle on a little bit of Cold War paranoia and you have The Iron Giant, a period set character study of a human being and a creature not of this world.The film is one of which it is difficult to not just sit there, and stare in both wonder but more importantly appreciation at what's being presented to you. While both colourful and atmospheric, I was most impressed with director Brad Bird's attention to character detail when it came to the animation. It's the little things; the way in which the Iron Giant himself moves around in the manner in which he does. The Iron Giant is big and hulking but its presence is juxtaposed with the very fragile and delicate relationship he has with a young boy, who is established to be pretty desperate for a friend or companion early on. The Giant's presence and traits are comparable to the only villainous character of the piece, an F.B.I. agent who's grossly smaller than The Giant but seems more threatening despite the height difference and jolts about in an urgent and jittery manner giving off an entirely different feeling to that of the large, lumbering but friendly robot.Bird's work here reminded me of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit series, a series which I feel has since partly been inspired by The Iron Giant. There is that knowing feeling behind the production; that setting in the past and that referencing to what the filmmaker enjoys or grew up enjoying, indeed The Iron Giant's tag-line is 'It came from outer space!', maybe a nod to Hollywood science fiction films of the 1950s and 60s that dealt with the fear of impending Communist-related invasions. The link is uncanny  a giant robot the most antagonistic character of the film, believed to be Russian, sent to 'the good ol' U.S.A.' in order to destroy the nation from within.The hero of the title is a nine year old boy named Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) and lives with his mother Annie (Aniston) and in a desperate attempt to prolong some sort of relationship with another being other than his mother, he brings home little animals not exactly fit for household domestication. The establishment introduces this fact and acts as a good introduction to post-modern artist, working in a time not ready for the post-modern, Dean McCoppin (Connick Jr.) who's a friend and ally for them later on. After some other initial events, a large robot voiced by Vin Diesel, who merely has to supply some grunts and other such noises that eventually turn into synthesised words, comes into contact with Hogarth and they strike up a friendship following a train-wreck.Enter F.B.I. agent Kent Mansley, played by Christopher McDonald in the sort of slimy role you'd associate with him, in all his paranoid glory. I think initially, we don't really mind if Mansley gets his prize. He makes some enquiries and asks about but he's just doing his job. We know about as much about it as he does and it hasn't really earned its place in our hearts but it's not until Bird brilliantly brings together both the Giant's friendship with the boy and Kent's gradual obsession with the capturing of the robot until we veer more into a thought process that demands we don't want to see him get his man.Echoing what Bird sets up at the beginning, The Giant acts as a fatherly figure for Hogarth; wearing a constant smile on his face and vastly becoming one of the friendliest non-human components to a relationship involving children we've seen on screen. From the Cold War era sci-fi films of the 1950s onwards to Spielberg's E.T. and Cameron's second Terminator film, the referencing and inspirations flow and flow. Additionally, the other feelings I got amidst all this harked way back to comedy of the silent era and the use of heartfelt music and shots of character's reactions while humorous exchanges were played out  it seems Bird's knowledge and love of cinema-past knows no end.Despite this phenomenon of a giant robot landing on Earth and a child taking a likening to it, the film looks at the identity of the robot more than it does anyone else. As a grey and hulking thing, is possesses neither the colour to place it into any particular category nor the necessary intelligence to place it within another. What reminded me of the second Terminator film apart from the obvious fatherly connotations was the scene in which the boy teaches it the difference between good and evil, and the poor kid uses all the facilities available to him, which peak at mere comic books, to give this creature some sort of identity and how he can be 'good' like Superman instead of 'bad' like the typical 'destroy the world' aliens  perhaps a reference to more recent blockbusters like Independence Day which rely on flashy visuals, hostile aliens and zero logic. The Iron Giant is the opposite of this and is vastly superior. Towards the end, there is one lump in the throat moment and I don't think the immediate ending does the film a disservice. The Iron Giant is truly a special animation for children and adults alike.",8,1,2,18 January 2009
Shrek," Far from being just another Mickey Mouse animation; Shrek is a good natured, well pitched animated film which ticks enough boxes.
","Shrek begins with in a fanciful, overly romantic tone as what we assume to be an off screen narrator speaks in warm voice whilst dictating to us the words accompanying the images of your more stereotypical fairy-tale novella. After a few pages, it's revealed the narrator was, in fact, the titular character turning the pages before we hear him scoffing at such literature and verbally dismissing it as nonsense. What follows is the tearing out of a page from the book in order to use the item, now rendered a loose discarded piece of paper, for other such activities too crude to mention here; a plain-as-day rejecting of such unreal narrative notions and elements in order for other usages after the establishment that such notions do exist. While hinting at revision, one cannot deny that by the time all things have been said and done and the film has reached its emotionally charged climax, 2001 digitally animated comedy Shrek is, in hindsight, all too keen to resort to such codes in order to push home its would-be emotional drive. The film never really struck me as the great; fun-for-all; computer animated glory-fest is has done to others, but more-so as a decent adventure film with its politics all in the right place and an effective buddy comedy toing and froing between three very distinct, very irregular but highly characterised central performers.When the door to the outhouse in which the titular Shrek resides during that opening swings open revealing our lead, we get a good look at both the large green Ogre that Mike Myers voices and the sort of life he leads for the first time. Inhabiting a secluded swamp in the not so dense forest of an enchanted land, the beast has a grotesque but functioning way of living which sends up many-a human traits such as the brushing of one's teeth; preparing meals and taking showers thus burring lines between what might constitute as anthropomorphism and a character in a narrative framework you could just as easily humanify – in a world rife with both human beings and distinct fictitious, fairy-tale/nursery-rhyme characters, Shrek beclouds is the bridge between the two predominant interspecies. He lives a lonely life, but one which he very-much enjoys; a peaceful one, despite being somewhat ferocious but a functioning one despite the isolation. Early on, it's established the height he has over human-beings as well as the problems he appears to have with those of an authoritarian ilk; the fear-factor Shrek possess arriving in-tow and giving him a mark advantage over most.Around him sees a land ruled by the tyrannical, imperialist Lord Farquaad (Lithgow); a man besotted with rounding up each and every anthropomorphic character, ranging from Pinnochio to the three blind mice, that plagues his kingdom so as to place them in a ghetto-like locale which just happens to double up as Shrek's lonely pad. Farquaad inhabits a walled in central hub named Duloc, which sports a Disney World-like entrance, in which he distributes his evilness; the torturing of innocents and the ruing of not having a partner seemingly his day's norm. With the bad news dished out and a severe disrupture to Shrek's already established world looming, the ogre takes it upon himself whilst aided by Eddie Murphy's motor-mouthed Donkey, whom through one means or another stumbles into his life, to venture out and deal with this problem in the most direct and no-nonsense of fashions. However, Shrek's arrival at Duloc to see Farquaad only complicates matters when the ruler offers him the chance to rid his land of the creatures so as to retain his old ways if he so manages to bring Pricness Fiona (Diaz) back from a dragon guarded tower so as to marry him.The journey back to the kingdom following the obtaining of Fiona sees the film hint at some rather unorthodox traits that Fiona may sport, her ability to interact with the world around her in an uncanny fashion leading to later reveals. All of this gives way to the film's chief politic: that it's better to be who you are and admit to it than cover up and attempt to be somebody else, and in sticking true-to-yourself, you will eventually find more in the form of happiness than you would living a surface lie. There can be little doubt the team behind the film put an awful lot of effort into proceedings; the film sporting numerous moments that display their eye for detail, an instance in which the overly powerful lead accidentally yanks a door handle clean out of its hinges upon impatiently dragging a character from where they were in a room to the exit one of them – made even funnier when we realise that character is wittering on with poetic but humorous waffling, a slight instance which is easy to miss and yet has had precise craft to it. The film is a middling effort, a short and sharp and breezy tale of a somewhat self-centred lead operating with a free-spirited and friendly supporting character whose livelihood is itself in jeopardy; the reoccurring question as to whether the lead will be able to achieve a sort of parity as well as see the error of his ways essentially what's being tested. Its messages and ideas are explored in a routine and passable enough manner, the bulk of it fairly simplistic without exploring any particularly brilliant territory, but it isn't without charm nor some genuinely amusing or indeed heartfelt moments even if it is running on adrenalised formula.",6,0,1,9 April 2011
The Silence of the Lambs," Expansive study in character and atmosphere, blending horror with thriller and coming out the other end on top.
","'Oh, he's a psychopath....' exclaims Baltimore asylum boss Dr. Chilton (Heald) to both us and our lead as we get first wind of a certain imprisoned madman who'll hopefully help both her, and the agency she works for in the F.B.I., catch a killer at large. The first time we arrive at said psychopath's cell, it is en route through many-a door and corridor as Chilton describes in a chaotic and disorientating nature the rules which come with interacting with this beast – a final warning as the screen, drenched in blood red lighting, when a photograph of a deformed nurse harmed only recently by the inmate is displayed to her. The key item being that we do not see the picture, and along with all the hustling build up, must come to our own conclusions about the imminent interaction. Build up such as the above aids in making the man feel as if he's present more in the film than in actuality.Such a sequence, or chain of events, goes a long way in capturing everything that makes The Silence of the Lambs so effective, that sense of talking about something and building it up rather than out-and-out showing it. The common place is that the first thing you jump to when talking about the film is the particular character the above dialogue refers to, and how their presence is both so very fascinating as well as rather frightening. The fact the film balances this well enough with everything else so that as to avoid ultimately overwhelm the film is an achievement. That character is of course a certain Hannibal Lecter, an individual played by Anthony Hopkins in what is a highly praised performance for his portrayal of the man, a victim of countless spoofs; references and imitations since. Lecter is both foil and mentor; both anti-hero and a (not THE) villain, psychotic enough to have previously killed and maimed, but smart enough to identify when genuinely coming across as helpful to a cause might aid in his own intentions. There is a degree of irony in the fact F.B.I. chief Jack Crawford (Glenn) attempts to exploit the mind of Lecter so much that his desperation forces him to turn to a young female rookie, something that ultimately stirs Hannibal's creative juices enough so that he may carry out what eventually happens in the film.When our lead, a certain Clarice Starling (Foster), arrives at a heavily guarded entrance, the film is constructed through Starling's point of view as we observe security screens; an armed guard plus his arsenal of shotguns as well as heavily fortified steel doors protecting this little area all by itself stand tall, all before settling on the welcoming tone of an orderly named Barney. The film's first interaction between them plays out, and the film toys with all the prior material in having Lecter demand he have a 'closer' look at her identification. But despite Lecter, it is lead Clarice Starling whom drives the film; heading on out into her own arc of self discovery within a circular journey; all the while with the slow burning memories and tragedies of years of old eating away at the back of her mind. Whilst the leads ponder Lecter as a tool, key for burrowing into a certain Buffalo Bill (Levine), a slight nickname for a serial killer in operation, it is Lecter that provides the burrowing into Starling and her own past for sake of us that proves just as interesting.Most of the latter half of Starling's past, that is to say her childhood, reveals a sense of desperation to aid the helpless or a violent reaction to slaughter and murder and an aching lust to reject it in helping those that are victims of it. This, combined with her father and both his role and his fate, help in fleshing Starling out and getting to understand why it is what she is, something a little more than a nameless; faceless protagonist detective hired to take care of whatever case because the demands of that genre implore it. If American films of the action, thriller or detective ilk produced in the 1980s fed off an idea of the male lead and their body being put through a grinding process of harm and hurt, then The Silence of the Lambs toys with this in its opening segment when a yet to be identified Starling huffs and puffs her way through an assault course in rural nowhere, putting her body through the established test before someone intervenes and sends her on her way to an assignment which will ultimately lead her on her quest. Progressively, the film develops Starling as the agent she will become; observing tiny details such as having her describe what she correctly assumes Buffalo Bill to look like, a scene after we observe him for the first time in swiping his next victim.The tie that binds Starling's world both inside and outside of the F.B.I. academy is a degree of sexism and individualism; exemplified when male trainees gaze at her as she jogs past but also when she is surrounded in an elevator early on, the colours of the occupants' jerseys getting across a sense of alienation. This, as Chilton's futile flirting plays out at the asylum; a moth expert's advances are rejected and an additional sense of astonishment contained within by local law enforcers when she orders out a room full of them whom are relegated to having to bear it occur. The text is aware of both its lead character's strength and gender, providing a number of instances in which the danger of getting knocked back down because of both role and gender is made aware but always rejected. The film is a powerful, well observed pot boiler as detectives race against time and a fascinating third element in Lecter ominously plans and ploys. In combining narrative with character study, Demme has created something remarkable.",10,1,2,10 March 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Powerful and engaging, made so if only for its sub-text; The Dark Knight Rises is what it is at its heart, but that heart is wholly in the right place.
","Do not think that by conquering the enemies inherent in the Middle East during that conflict for long enough, you have conquered 'terror'. It was four years between Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, wherein an enemy epitomising 'terror', from cyber to the kind that targets the mass destruction of iconographic structures, in The Joker, was vanquished. The time in the fictitious American city Gotham ever since has been relatively calm, almost eerily so – were the sporadic reigns of terror that befell this poor city from the odd assortment of criminal masterminds finally over? No, for the threat of terrorism at home is still, and always was, as prominent-a threat as an I.E.D. was for a soldier in Afghanistan. One day, the War in the Middle East will end but the likes of Britain; France; America; Australia and Holland will always be on the brink of facing a threat: that of domestic Islam and the ever-growing appetite for the power they crave. It is in The Dark Knight Rises, Nolan's 2012 film and last in trology which began quite innocuously in hindsight, that this eerie subtext (nay, warning) has been placed for the mainstream to digest.Nolan and his brother, co-writer Jonathan, are English, but they are located in America out of a combination of business and what appears to be politics: they see what's happening to those in the U.K. and their designs on getting involved are expressed via a multi-million dollar film. Credit to them in this regard, and for once it isn't deemed good enough to walk away from a summer event-movie having enjoyed the visuals a bit and felt relaxed for two hours. Living in his huge manor house is Bruce Wayne (Bale), a character epitomising your bog-standard white Western shut-in who stays away from the approaching storm on the outside, a person of whom is later forced into standing up and being counted when inaction only leads to a disturbing changing of the guard through war and street conflict. Filmically, Wayne is shut away out of having conquered his nemesis and lost the love of his life and so long has he been in there that it has been eight years since anyone last saw Batman.Tom Hardy has come a long way in his ability to play the villain; especially when one remembers the snivelling, almost pathetic, performance he gave in Star Trek: Nemesis all those years ago, of which carried no menace nor conviction. His villain is Bane. Aggressive; provocative; anonymous; powerful and with a large following, Hardy is essentially playing the physical epitome of Islam – his disturbing origins in this unspecific, desert-like locale and now seemingly prominent stature in The West serves only to confirm it. Bane leads a ragtag crew, most of whom look Muslim in ethnicity, seeks to raze Gotham City (here representing the Western world) to the ground so as to create a new order of rule: a Caliphate, one that resents Capitalism and everything in place now. His methods are brutal, his ways unflinching. He kills those who were once aides to his cause when they expire because, at the end of the day, they were always his enemy. Much like Islam in the West, when there are enough of them and they are able to garner enough control, they will conquer their leftist 'allies' with similar clinical methods as they too, at the end of the day, were always Caucasian and very rich.Tossed into proceedings is Anne Hathaway's Catwoman, although I devilishly read that at no point does anyone refer to her as 'Catwoman' – only 'Selena'. Somewhat oddly, her presence is ultimately superfluous; her scenes constructed with too much of a nudge and wink, they are too self-conscious – this is The Dark Knight Rises, not The Sting. Hathaway plays a thief, a cat-burglar. There is what seems to be a sly nod to Burton's 'Returns' early on, when we witness her 'work' as a submissive maid to a rich Western male. We recall how life started for Pfeiffer's Selena Kyle, a coffee maker and dogsbody, before the character study branched out and she became the opposite. When Kyle here tears away the insignia that signals her role as a maid, the 'reveal' is made and we acknowledge that Nolan wants to hit the ground running in a way that is the polar opposite to before.But the film is Bane's and the subtext that comes with him. Sequences towards the end of the film wouldn't be so hideously frightening if they weren't so truthfully prophetic; Bane's mock-court room, where those privileged are sentenced to death, is the bringing to life of what an Islamic Sharia court will look like when those charged with being guilty of not already having converted will face. What we see are essentially sequences of ethnic cleansing, something which is already going on under a more subtle guise in most Western nations; the punishment for those opulent enough to be guilty a sort of spin on the Quran's many ironic tortures awaiting the non-believer in Hell. Nolan suggests, through a police commissioner who must take over when Gordon (Oldman) sustains injury, that limp-wristed and liberal attitudes to quashing the early signs of the takeover will be useless. Additionally, he has Bane launch his official 'Islamic' revolution at an NFL game, a descent into carnage and terror when, poignantly, the American national anthem (something patriotic & nationalistic) has concluded and ultimately signals the end of an era. The film carries with it weaknesses, of course; its core ingredients of character and story cannot equal its substantially dangerous subtext. Narratively, it is little more than a film about an evil guy with a big bomb looking to blow up the world (city), thus the film isn't any more or less challenging in that regard than something like 'Moonraker'. What it does have, however, is a warning through a sub-text and boy what a subtext.",7,1,4,2 August 2013
Iron Man," Action sequences; comedy; gross-out scenes; sexual tension complete with feint romance and a battle of good vs. evil sees Iron Man waver but just about hit the mark.
","The last time I saw a fictional superhero in a red and gold get-up flying through the air and generally trying its best to 'wow' and entertain a crowd, must've been in that 1996 Schwarzenegger Christmas comedy entitled Jingle All the Way. Thankfully, Iron Man is a little better but it additionally made me daydream about what it might've been like had Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.), the ever present lead in the film, ever stumbled across the two camp hit men from 1971's Diamond Are Forever, you know: the one's that flit around, killing people here and there while philosophising about certain ponderous subjects that come compete with quotes like: 'If God had intended man to fly, then he'd have given him wings.' Rather immediately, we can assume Tony Stark be the sort of man to think outside the proverbial box; he doesn't just want to fly, he wants to do it without the wings – bizarre, all-over-the-place-colour-scheme and all.For what it's worth, Iron Man isn't particularly that bad. It covers a tale, indeed a plight, of one small; relatively thin; harmless looking; eccentric even, and soft bodied man of whom represents something far larger, overpowering and powerful in Stark Enterprises, which is Tony's company that he's inherited from his father. Iron Man begins with one of those annoyingly quaint VT sequences, the sort that exists solely to inform us of what's going on; the sort that crams in years, sometimes decades, worth of predicament and event purely so that it can fast-track all the necessary back-log and get to this point in these person's lives. From just about here, it dives headfirst into Afghanistan and presents us with this rich, life loving and seemingly psychologically spotless hero as he merrily romps his way through the desert with the United States Army. Only, the convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive.First and foremost, Stark is an arms dealer of sorts. He creates weapons so that others may use them for destructive and ill-advised purposes. When it transpires Stark is attacked by his own weapons, there is a moment of clarity that tells our lead that things must change; and that means risking loosing all the close-to-unwatchably-bad content/lifestyle just prior to him flying out to The Middle East. The cheery and sugary scenes of the pompous Stark milling about with reporters, women and extravagant events as he indulges in nights out at the casino and one night stands comes across as woefully inept but tactfully so; simultaneously providing us with a point of attack that gets across what Stark is like but also providing us with a certain wrong belief that is instilled within the lead, something that resembles a gung-ho, 'nuke 'em now' policy that will change.Iron Man is competent enough, but I wonder if director Jon Favreau is fit for this sort of material. Stark's realisation of what it is he actually does and what it is he actually contributes to in the world feels underplayed, while his shooting of an Afghan cave system in which Stark is held hostage, and forced into building a weapon of mass destruction, looks less grotty; grimy; undesirable and unpleasant then it does a themed entrance to 'the underground zone' at a theme park complete with cheap, plastic cave walls and fake sand. There is a distinct, but uneven, feel to this segment of the film; an acceptance that this is what's being done, and this is the study being made; but a biting feeling that had the budget been halved and the picture looked less colourful and less polished, we might be feeling the pain with the lead a little more.It's in and around that prison cave system that Stark realises he won't be building any more weapons, so rather than do that, he stumbles across the idea of building a seemingly indestructible suit made of iron that, essentially and perhaps ironically, he will use in combat later on and thus render a weapon of sorts. I think a lot of Iron Man would like to be about the deployment of weapons to other nations by more powerful nations. Stark, being an American and being the head of an all powerful American organisation that ISN'T the government, and his actions recall the giving of Stinger Missile launchers to the Afghans to use against the invading Soviets during The Cold War, and how, in 2003; that news footage of a ground Afghan using a Stinger Missile launcher against an American plane rather eerily comes back to tarnish that decision. By the end of the film, Stark hasn't perfected a weapon as much as he has modernised a suit of some sort that aids in the attempting of ridding the world of those that mis-use these weapons.But slightly interesting study aside, the film is not without reservations. The audaciously named Pepper Potts is played in agonising; not unwatchable, but close, fashion by Gwyneth Paltrow; while a lot, and I mean a lot, of time is reserved for the development of the iron suit which itself involves testing, tests failing and a lot of dumb slapstick humour. The typically British, and-thus-intelligent, computer in Jarvis (Bettany) is a nonsense inclusion as is the manner in which one such Afghan sacrifices himself in order to aid Stark in his getting out of a predicament, which is a little off key. The film may be a large, loud and somewhat dumb at times production, but it's aiming for that in the first place. The fact it has a degree of substance running just below it, calling into question one's morals amongst a few other things, helps elevate the film slightly but it's underwhelming and quite daft in the long run.",6,1,2,2 August 2009
Tombstone," Energy; pot boiling; characterisation and ultimately heart sapped out of a film of its time, but Tombstone suffices as a basic, action orientated flick.
","George P. Cosmatos' loose 1993 remake of John Ford's Classical Hollywood era western My Darling Clementine is a relatively daft and wavy film; a piece that announces its intentions very early on with a big shoot out after some bandits inflict a large amount of cruelty on a bunch of townsfolk, whereas the original built to a climactic shootout in which characters we'd spent the entire film with rode on in and put themselves in the face of danger. Tombstone feels the need to establish, in the most basic of manners, that the 'bad guys' are the ones cackling and free willingly executing whilst a bunch of gunshots sound off for the sake of it. Tombstone veers more towards actioner than it does western, providing basic arcs for its characters and hand-holding us through whom we ought to be rooting for; but what else can you expect from the director of the second Rambo film? There's that wonderful instance in Ford's version of the story which sees a character by name of Doc Holliday, who has spent most of the opening forty minutes giving Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp grief, have the Clementine of the title walk back into his life and put him through an emotional grinder of forlorn memories and drink. The shift in balance was stark, an informing to the audience that just because a character gives grief to someone we might assume to be whatever protagonist the film has lined up, does not mean he cannot be a human being; with respective flaws and characteristics. Tombstone tiptoes around this naturalistic air of plight, opting for archetype more often than I'd have liked whilst spending a gross amount of time plodding along before breaking off into bouts of shooting and chaos at intermittent times.The Wyatt Earp of Tombstone is played by Kurt Russell, an ex-marshal whom we know is good natured at the core due to stopping of a number of horses from having further pain and harm inflicted upon them by a certain perpetrator; an entire sequence which stands in stark comparison to the opening bandits and their attitudes towards the innocent. Journeying to the Arizona town of Tombstone with his brothers, where they hope to settle down, Earp is mangled into defending the town from the aforementioned group of a group of bullyin', gun-totin' cowboys; led by Curly Bill Brocius (Boothe). Doc Holliday is this time played by Val Kilmer, a laid-back; black-clad; smooth talking' card player whom we observe beat the system, win a card game, engage in a bar-room brawl of some nature before swinging his way outta' there with the money in one hand and the gal in the other – yes, it does feel a little fabricated. Holliday's relationship with Earp is certainly more low key in this one, something that fast-tracks character relations between the two and forces the film to focus on the cowboy gang as a primary source of antagonism, something that doesn't crop up nearly as much as Earp and Holliday's banter in Ford's version; hence the reason Tombstone comes across as the plodding piece it is.Italian born Cosmatos has his lead reflect what might very well be his own view on the material, in the sense Russell's Earp has an opinion on all the death and what's going on around him but it's a vacant feeling. A character's attempt at raising theological discussion with Russell's Earp near the beginning of the film is somewhat dismissed; amidst all the killing and hurt, it's established he doesn't care much about it – it's more so how Earp 'does' it rather than how he 'feels' about it, something that echoes the director's approach to the subject matter, in the sense he is more interested in black and white heroes and villains than looking at what these people think about those around them and particular predicaments. Holliday's easy truce with Earp is representational of this.Earp doesn't initially want the responsibility of keeping law and order. His smart and well dressed brothers stand in articulate contrast to Boothe's ragtag bunch of sloppy, roughly dressed and ugly looking bandits; although the film implores, in a bizarre manner, that practically everybody in the town is bound by a theatrical performance of a Shakespere piece; and that when the poetic nature of something so beautiful begins, everybody keeps quiet and observes. The film is one in which the focus is on men, and their relationship with one another and how they come to exist within the enclosed space of the town of Tombstone; a place that two different factions see two different, distinct futures in which they are at the respective centrefold of it all. In a film about men, men co-existing; men sorting out their relations with one another, it ought to be no surprise that the female characters are pushed to the back row - relegated to staying at home; staying silent and being seen out and about beside their man.Regardless, Tombstone isn't a bad film but it's certainly a lot less interesting than films that have taken on the story of Earp in the past. As an actioner, it works relatively well but as a character piece, it limps along for over two hours purely so that it can boil down to a showdown between good and evil. The melodramatic thunderclaps complete with lightning in the background as a key character dies about half way through exemplifies this, in the sense Cosmatos needs aid within the dramatic thunderclap sound effects to bring about more emotion out of the occurrence, rather than rely on all the previous character driven content for it to genuinely play out effectively. I like a good film about a power struggle in one locale between two groups of men, each with their own ideologies and attitudes towards life and Tombstone does suffice, it's just a little drawn-out; limp and mysteriously uninvolving for most of the time.",6,2,3,11 March 2010
Blade Runner," Visually appealing; narratively challenging and with an eye on many-a film making aspects makes Blade Runner somewhat of a success.
","Blade Runner will eventually see its two lead characters, or its protagonist and his ultimate goal in tracking something down in the form of another character, share a memorable scene on a roof top of a distant Los Angeles, far into the future. After all of what's gone on and after all the venturing and the talking and the process of investigation, it boils down to one 'evil' character, who's a machine, and one 'just' character, a human-being, interacting; at which point we realise the human-being was a genre archetype and a plain old character following orders given to him by a larger force whereas the robot was a wandering, free spirit whom dared to dream and craved more out of life. The human comes across as more machine-like than the machine, with the machine coming across as more emotional and feeling-filled than the member of the human species. Such is the richness of Blade Runner that tn a lesser film, this exchange wouldn't have taken place and the character of Roy might've been a homicidal robot with a mindless agenda.Born into a slavery; used and then put through a grinder of negative emotions, Roy revolts and breaks out, consequently freeing himself and allowing himself the ability to explore things at his own pace, opening up his mind and allowing him to explore; learn; love and want to harm those that destroyed what he loved after being an assistant to the system. Blade Runner is like that, an eye on spectacle and scope for its location just as much as it has a spot of affection for its characters in what they think, feel and desire; if indeed they're even interested in anything more than grey trench-coats; glum expressions and order following .The lead is a certain ex-police officer named Rick Deckard (Ford), a man occupying a glum and gloomy, rain-sodden Los Angeles in 2019; a man of whom trudges through damp, wet streets with many others in a doomy looking; steamy and enclosed Chinatown area as large blimps hover above the mere mortals scrambling around in their squaller advertising breaks away to more tropical, more Utopian places. Director Ridley Scott opens his film with an establishing shot of the entire city, flying cars and the impressive canopy layer of some skyscrapers capturing the beauty and sheer awe within as an accompanying instrumental musical track emphasises both these traits. This is interestingly interjecting with random bursts of flames from vents of some kind, the likes that instill sudden senses of danger and risk of harm; perfectly capturing the world he's about to take us into as the camera very slowly creeps towards the city.The film gives its lead, Deckard, a mission in the grand tradition of noir in the sense it is his job to find something for someone. In days of old; be it The Maltese Falcon or Murder, My Sweet; noir leads have usually looked for an item or a person. Blade Runner, in all its hybridising glory, has fun with this particular premise in having its lead look for a sort of combination of both: a man/machine hybrid named a Replicant. The chief Replicants in the story, who've gone rouge and are seeking an extension of life, are Pris (Hannah), the film's femme fatale archetype whose birthday the film teasingly places on Valentine's Day; Zhora (Cassidy); Leon Kowalski (James) and the somewhat deranged and equally disturbing in his persistent state of calmness, Roy Batty (Hauer).Scott gets across a sense of futuristic scope in the film by setting a sequence at the slimiest, seediest and nastiest of run down night spots than you can, but a place that actually comes with advanced video phone technology in the back, suggesting that a sense of technological advancement has reached even these sorts of God-forsaken places. The film's meshing of classical noir with more contemporary science fiction is a given; but the film's hybridising of genres is perhaps best highlighted in a scene involving two characters, a toy manufacturer named Seb (Sanderson) and the aforementioned Pris, whom walk down a hallway of an apartment block towards Seb's home. Lights from outside systematically light up and make dimmer again the hallway, in doing so, casting expressionistic shadows across the walls and floors rendering the location one of both horror and noir as this strange looking woman with an agenda attempts to infiltrate her way in. The sequence is given an added sense of horror when we enter the man's apartment and observe the uncanny array of odd looking moving toys he has made over the years. This strange imagery combines with Pris' overall look in creating something quite terrifying, something the film acknowledges when it has Pris disguise herself as one of these toys later on in another sequence, suggesting a certain 'at one-ness' she shares with the items. The lighting lights the location the whole time with sudden glares and then total darkness, suggesting a sense of light or life that'll shortly come to an end, like an average house light strobing before it dies out.The film places Deckard on a strand of the detective ilk, he visits places and garners clues to everything which along the way leads him to the character of Rachel (Young), but the film is not an exercise in narrative as much as it is an exercise in technicality and mise-en-scene. Its grim view on man and machine being unable to co-exist in a world full of modernity and technological advancements is highlighted in an early scene involving Leon and a test of some description, as well as later on when Roy essentially kills off his creator, is counter-balanced with Deckard's ability to connect with Replicant Rachel. Blade Runner is an interesting film; a wonderful combining of a maker with a keen eye on the visual and love for one or more genres with complex items and ideas explored accordingly.",7,2,5,13 April 2010
Bruce Almighty," With great power comes great responsibility.
","If Tears for Fears' 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' hadn't already been used in Adam Sandler's 2006's comedy 'Click'; then I might have been forever associating that piece of music to this; Bruce Almighty, which apart from being one of lead actor Jim Carrey's best films; also doubles up as director Tom Shadyac's best from what I've seen. Bruce Almighty is a film with a heart; with a true heart. Its idea is that of one where the hero, who is of course down and out, would get the opportunity to play God but it isn't a film that merely gives Carrey an excuse to act stupid in a manner that may have anyone under the age of sixteen laughing but the rest of us cringing; oh no, it's something a little more than that.From very early on, it would seem both Carrey and Shadyac are harking back to their old ways. There is a massive billboard advertising Bruce Nolan (Carrey) half way through the film which is a promotional photo from Liar, Liar from what I've read; Bruce also references Ace Ventura with the 'Hi-Ho Away Silver!' quote and you could well change 'allrighty-then!' into 'Almighty-then!' But there are deeper things than that. The set up revolves around one man and his tragedy in a way reminiscent to 1994 Carrey master class The Mask and like The Mask, Carrey's character is given superhuman powers which enables him to turn his life around from zero to hero as well as help out other people now and again. But whilst The Mask was a little lagging in its narrative what with its clichéd mobsters and so forth, Bruce Almighty makes up for in heart and realism. At a time when so many big budget films are being made and distributed, it is great to see a film like this not take advantage of its budget. The film's idea of God is not a spectacular vision of light, CGI effects and so forth but in the form of Morgan Freeman; himself chipping in with references to his previous work: 'You'll need room se7en on the se7enth floor' he quips. Heaven as a filmic space is fascinating to look into and parallels with Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure spring to mind but the film's idea of heaven is not this vast, expansive space with people entering all the time but this tiny office floor inhabited by nothing and nobody bar Nolan and God himself.It would seem strange of me to say so, but the film acts better as a character study of one man; not a comedy. It's now apparent that Carrey can play the serious role what with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but here, he is breaking through into that 'serious' mould by taking on a subject matter and certain characters in their own psychological jeopardy whilst mastering basic one-liner comedy and giving us a performance; this is why you could argue that this is Carrey's best film over the likes of The Cable Guy and the Ace Ventura films: he begins one person, progresses and finishes someone else. The Mask did this on a basic level but much of that was on a far, far higher comic level. Another subject the film tackles with relative ease is the topic of God himself. Whilst maintaining the perhaps outdated theory that God is both male and inhabits a white beard; people will be quick to point out God is indeed black. Some interesting points arise here; namely the fact we have to assume Freeman is playing the Christian God and not Allah; a Roman God or anything else. Secondly, notice how things such as the slave trade in centuries gone by have perhaps been overlooked: if God really is black, how does he justify how black people have been portrayed and used throughout history? It's interesting to note that the gang of thugs featured were of the Hispanic variety but whether what has anything to do with anything remains too ambiguous to comment on; as do the multiple theories behind casting Morgan Freeman.Due to my feelings on having this film labelled a comedy; which I feel is wrong, I think it fails at certain times when it tires to be funny. Carrey is of course his usual smart, fast and quirky self who cracks a couple of jokes and attempts to make us laugh but how much of it was scripted? Did Carrey make a few additions in the process? Because it isn't as hilarious as it would've been had actual writers spent time to come up with material. Consequently, the scripted humour comes in the form of Nolan and Grace's (Aniston) pet dog constantly peeing on the furniture as they pick him up and carry him outside: genitalia and urine in clear view  not funny. Also, Nolan's telepathic foreplay with Grace through the walls gives us a crude inside look of what it's like to make love as a 'God' but it isn't funny and feels very out of place in the film as it acts as an excuse to produce meek, juvenile laughs  as does the urinating dog re-occurring joke.I think that with humour aside, Bruce Almighty works as an inventive and challenging film with a heart at is centre built on a great premise. The humour in the form of Bruce using his powers to win Grace back after certain events was weak as was the way the film stopped for that entire segment. But the film has some fantastic ideas and some interesting moments that have you laughing at the inventiveness rather than the jokes. A clever and thought provoking film but don't expect to laugh too much.",6,0,1,3 January 2008
Casino Royale," Bond is reinvented by the man who did the very same thing 11 years previously in a touching and engaging thriller.
","In 1995, New Zealand born director Martin Campbell made Goldeneye, the 17th entry into the James Bond franchise. Campbell managed to update and bring a new lease of life to a series many thought would peter out following the end of The Cold War between global superpowers. Not only did Campbell update Bond from a globe trotting, hunting down of drug smuggling and cartel dealing drug barons but he poked fun at the Bond character, having characters rendering him a 'relic' from The Cold War and others laughing at the quips that has made him famous off screen; quips such as 'shaken but not stirred' given a shake down of its own: 'shaken, but not undisturbed' laughed uneasy Russian ally Valentin Zukovsky.The film marked Pierce Brosnan's debut and is one of my few favourites in a franchise a lot of us like purely because we might have grown up watching them but viewing them now they do come across as rather ordinary means of entertainment. Indeed, how many times do we mention James Bond when really talking about the greats or indeed the minor greats of cinema? Fast-forward the series eleven years and we have Casino Royale; new Bond and new universe in which to play about with. Re-enter Martin Campbell and another good entry to the series. Once again, Campbell updates Bond but this time into a new universe as a new world order (war on global terrorism) looms in the background. Campbell rescues Bond once again, ripping him away from phoney windsurfing CGI effects and visual 'nods' to Bond films past alá Die Another Day just as he did in 1995 when Bond was last seen chasing drug barons on a revenge mission, and gives him room to actually be someone.I can remember seeing Casino Royale in the cinema, two years after I saw 2004's Layer Cake which starred Bond-to-be Daniel Craig. I can remember that shot in which he is given a silenced pistol at a friend's house and how he mockingly creeps down a corridor in his friend's house alá James Bond. His friend reacts with a whispered expletive and the audience chuckled  the star may well have been born right there.Casino Royale begins in black and white, a tactic used to get across that feeling of the retro or time gone by, as Bond (Craig) nears his second hit, a man on the take named Dryden (Sinclair). This use of black and white knocks us slightly, perhaps intended to pre-date 1962's Dr. No, this being a prequel of sorts and indeed, I cannot remember the use of black and white in too many other Bond films for the reasons to create a presence of history. I think Daniel Craig nails Bond in a certain sense through the face and facial expressions. Connery's Bond was a young and raw Bond, very much akin to Craig's here; Moore's smarmy and overly confident approach was perhaps suited to a man nearing the end of his 007 career where as Dalton's and Brosnan's seemed to get across a decent mixture of aggression and compassion, even if some of their respective films were a little ordinary.Craig plays Bond in the same raw style Connery did in the 1960s  Bond is new on the beat; he seems to enjoy the killing and the action. Indeed, that deliberately long tracking shot in on Craig's face as he watches a terrorist detonate his own bomb whilst it's attached to his belt evokes a joy that he not only saved the day but outsmarted his enemy in the process. Early on in the film, Bond's immaturity or eagerness pushes through in an impressively told manner  he isn't given a stone wall assignment by M (Dench) but acts on impulse, scooting around Madagascar and the Bahamas in search of whoever. What's interesting here and makes a further mockery of the laughably bad Bourne series is that in essence, these are chase sequences or ideas revolving around chase but they are shot, structured and edited in a fashion that is coherent and enjoyable. I'd rather watch the Miami airport chase ten times than sit through The Bourne Ultimatum again in its entirety.So Bond is the renegade, the anti-hero. But what follows and after a lot of talk of egos and so forth is a humbling; a rendez-vous with a female foil named Vesper Lynd who he will come to love. As a female character compared to the wife of a possible enemy earlier on, she isn't as glamorous; loose or seductive and the conversation she has with Bond about certain masculine traits including dress sense pushes her away from a typically loose or classical 'Bond girl', a cliché or something we've all come to easily identify. She is superior to Bond's previous squeeze in the film and acts as a foil more so than a piece of eye candy or a tool to assist Bond. There is a scene in which she is in the shower but it is a humane scene as she contemplates having seen death and dead bodies prior in the day for the first time. The typical characters in a 'Bond movie' are stripped down and presented as human, she isn't topless in the shower as Bond joins her, she is broken. Casino Royale is an enjoyable and well constructed espionage thriller that twists and turns throughout but remains a heartfelt and very engaging film.",7,0,2,4 November 2008
Toy Story 3," Mesmerising and delightfully pitched second sequel, with an astute focus on both absorbing adventure and observant tragedy combining to produce something special.
","Apart from being a cracking slice of entertainment, rich in its sense of adventure, more than competent in its ability to tell a narrative and packed with both genuinely funny and genuinely comedic moments; Lee Unkrich and the team at Disney Pixar's Toy Story 3 is a heartfelt and powerful piece; a film with the perpetual ability to be able to assuredly tap into some pretty raw human emotions and in the most engaging of fashions. Its universal achievement is its study of loss and post-script look at the fact that life does indeed go on after whatever tragedy might have previously befallen you. Here is the third film in a franchise which has stuck to its guns; providing more than mere blunt nostalgia and petty summer frills to an array of fans young enough to remember the first one as a wondrous animated adventure film, by effectively branching out in its overall study of something substantial; simultaneously refraining to pander to new generations of youngsters out for shrill entertainment in a CG animated form. The film is one very much for those whom have grown up with the characters and in-jokes; twelve year old newcomers out for the latest in commodity infused sequel shenanigans whom are not familiar with the other two need not apply.Lee Unkrich, the latest in a bevy of directors from Pixar to have come of age and take the reigns, does a stupendous job; delivering the goods on several fronts in what is a wondrous animation. The moment in the series we were all told to wake up and realise that the makers behind this fantastic franchise had plans of a much more grandeur nature than first perceived occurs in the first sequel of 1999; such a film shedding its initial direct to DVD approaches to pose the question as to what will happen to Tom Hanks' Woody and the gang of toys whose adventures we adore to follow when Andy, their-then child owner, grows up; goes to college and even ventures off on his honeymoon. Therein was the moment, following a pretty harrowing sequence about a discarded toy with her own back-story, during which the franchise appeared to come of age and that some pretty serious, even philosophical, ideas revolving around what it is to exist as a toy and what one's purpose in existing is when the child owner outgrows you, are posed.Toy Story 3 is the arriving at this point in that a 17 year old Andy, who's voiced by the original John Morris from the other two, is packing up and leaving for college; only, his room is being cleared out and certain items may or may not make the journey. 'Skateboard: college; little-league trophies: attic, apple-core: trash' states his mother in a ruthlessly blunt and cut-throat manner highlighting the frank and obtuse reality of the situation the toys face. After some brief deliberation, they realise they'd settle for the attic – at least they've all got the Christmas decoration toys up there for company. But it is a mix up with certain bags containing certain items which are destined for certain places which acts as the film's catalyst for all things both joyous and tragic to unfold; Andy's toys of old in the form of Tim Allen's Buzz Lightyear and Joan Cusack's Jessie the Cowgirl along with Mr. Potato Head (Rickles); Hamm (Ratzenberger) and Slinky Dog (Clark, after Varney's passing) eventually seeing fit to deliver themselves to a local nursery so that they may be played with over and over by the tots. It is Woody and Woody alone whom knows they were never initially destined for the garbage.What is captured and not shied away from at all is the apparent descent toward the inevitable; the film's sense of impending doom touched upon throughout, not least during the opening skit in which Woody's train-within-a-game goes over the edge of a destroyed bridge and we think the worst has happened, whereas, after this, the loss of fellow toys from previous films is touched upon instilling a sense of grief amidst proceedings. One scene early on out in the street sees the crushing of several trash bags in the back of a garbage truck, one of which we're initially led to believe contains Andy's toys, in what is another instance upon which the shocking inevitable has seemingly occurred and what the toys have striven to avoid all this time has become a harrowing reality.The arriving at the day-care nursery simultaneously opens up several tins of several different kinds of worms; at once welcoming and perceived as a Utopian place for all toys to be continuously played with over and over, things quickly descend into a nightmarish Hell-like scenario in which totalitarian rule runs the show. What is refreshing is that in order to get away from the day-care centre, the film must call upon times of old in having the toys work as a group in order to figure out the best course of action; the joy being in the process they go through to help turn the tide back into their favour once again. Ned Beatty lends his hand at voicing the chief antagonist in large, purple, initially friendly soft toy bear Lotso who's anything other than your more one dimensional villain bent on nastiness but, in actual fact, is granted a back-story involving experiences upon which he bases both his stance and ideologies. The film finds that perfect pitch between happy and sad; a bittersweet tale, around which characters we've come to adorn, strive to avoid suffering only to face a a not-so-bright light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. It is a remarkable and gorgeously effective piece on a plateau with some of the best in animated films from recent years.",8,0,1,12 January 2011
Trainspotting," Very good film that relies on visual style over narrative but delivers an anti-drug message, amongst other things, all the same.
","A film like Trainspotting can split your opinion right down the middle; a split more akin to the sort of opinion you might take away from a horror film. This split decision revolves around two things; firstly the gross content. Any film that makes you feel uneasy or quite sick at what's going on on screen could automatically plant a negative opinion within your mind but this idea battles with the effectiveness of the film in the sense; if a film is so nasty in its content and unravelling of events that it evokes a definite reaction from the viewer, it could be deemed a success because the filmmakers have succeeded in what they set out to do.Trainspotting is one of those films. Like I mentioned, horror films usually have this effect. An example could be Wolf Creek or Hostel; two films that gave me a distinct feeling of unpleasantness but some other recent horror films, such as The Descent or Miike's One Missed Call can leave me without any feeling at all as they meander along to their inevitable conclusions; throwing in plenty of blood-soaked action or dull jumps along the way. Are Wolf Creek and Hostel 'better' than these two because I had more of a reaction to them? Or are The Descent and One Missed Call 'better' because they didn't gross me out.Trainspotting isn't a horror film, but it borders on being a horrible film and I mean that in the nicest possible way. The film is so vile and disgusting in its visuals and establishing of certain situations (one in a public toilet springs to mind) that you just can't help but admire what they've done effect-wise but feel a little uneasy all the same. It's this emotional juxtaposition that director Danny Boyle pulls off here and I think it's this that makes Trainspotting the film it is, especially given the fact it is not particularly plot driven. Obviously you hear and take in a lot of what's already been said about a film as well known as Trainspotting and a film as 'accepted' as Trainspotting but it's more than a mere flavour of the month for a certain generation.At the time when this was made, the British crime genre (and later the gangster genre) could be seen as genres in a state of transition. Two years previously, with Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Shopping', there was a film that revolved around Britain's youth as they get up to youth orientated activities to do with crime. Then came Boyle's own Shallow Grave before this, a story about lowlifes doing low brow things always connected to crime. But it isn't the demonising of ram raiding and joyriding as seen in Shopping that is being studied here, more so the frequent use of the class A drug heroin. The film revolves around Renton (McGregor) and his cronies, all of whom are introduced somewhat perfectly at the very beginning echoing a tactic the godfather of British crime films Brighton Rock used at the very beginning of that film and something Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch.' would later re-use.Trainspotting is told from a second person point of view, that is the narrator is involved in the events he is telling us of. It's easy to miss but Renton actually comes off heroin on two occasions, from memory, in this film with the final time adding to the film's overall final twist. As an anti-hero, Renton fits the bill quite well. Whilst utterly despicable in his casualness at talking about and taking heroin, scenes that will no doubt have you winching if needles are not your bag, he sort of redeems himself when he talks about wanting to come off it and is put across as a social person who does seem to have certain hobbies and interests outside of being a junkie; namely talking about actors, films and Academy Awards.As with all youth orientated films, youth orientated activity plays a big role. Since the principal study here is the damning of heroin, secondary studies like casual sex and the over consumption of alcohol can be wrapped up in double quick time and take nothing away from the film. In fact the film can deliver these moral messages in more ways than one and actually turn them into entertaining scenes without ever feeling like a lecture or lesson. The scene where Renton tries to pick up a young girl at a club only to find out she was underage is one demonisation; Begbie's (Carlyle) incident with a cross dresser in an ever changing world he is in ignorance of is another incident and on another occasion a character and his partner wish to watch a previously recorded sex session as they commit the act once again; only the guy accidentally lent the tape to someone else thinking it was another video. Panic ensures when they assume it to be back at the video rental store.So while Trainspotting is a thrill ride that conflicts pleasantries with your filmic mind and that lust for a good, effective film; it holds up. There is a switch between realism (in general) and surrealism when he ventures down a toilet to find drugs and comes home wet to the eerie 'rehab-at-home' scene in which an apparent ghost of a previously dead baby climbs the walls and terrorises our hero as his friends and family slip in and out of the bed with him. Trainspotting is fast, furious and unrelenting in its content that can be funny; suspenseful; quite scary and downright disgusting Â– it's one of those film viewing experiences you don't forget in a hurry.",8,1,2,1 October 2008
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," It would appear moving away from the ice, on top of actually providing us with a little bit of adventure, was the answer all along.
","Can a film still be called 'Ice Age' when it takes place somewhere that resembles the tropics? For two whole films now, we've followed the adventures of a mammoth; a sloth and a sabre tooth tiger across the barren, icy lands at a time when land and continents intercepted with one another as one great big piece of terrain. There we sight gags to do with fossils and about evolution; second unit sequences involving icicles and would-be water flumes in a state of being frozen solid as well as meek tracts on global warming threatening to burn up all the frost and ice. Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a refreshing shift away from such things, the entry that moves things away from the above and into the locale of a jungle, a thriving; bustling zone wherein the crew are dwarfed by trees and shrubbery rather than glaciers and where the threat arrives in the form of dinosaurs. The sense of adventure is more omnipresent than usual, that sense of a space being alien or unfamiliar much more apparent. The answer, then, to the question is 'No', but the film is all the more better because of it.This sense of stark change is actually synonymous throughout the film, and things are genuinely better as a result. Not only has location changed, director of this edition Carlos Saldanha, with the more recurrent Mike Thurmeier, have started pairing the central characters off on top of having one of them face imminent fatherhood. All of this is before the distinct shift in filmic tone and narrative arc – an entry resisting depicting these animals trekking on a one way route across anonymous snowy plains trying to get somewhere, or deliver someone to someone else. Moreover, we're taking a leaf out of one of those old 60's monster movies wherein a bunch of people are stuck in a place time has forgotten; a place wherein strange creatures and dinosaurs rule the jungle dominated roost and the likes of Jackson's King Kong remake as well as 2001's second Jurassic Park sequel have much more recently dared to exploit on grander, bigger budgeted scales.Gone too is the sardonic wit and general cynicism attributed to Manfred and Mammoth, replaced with a sort of 'goofy impending father' routine as he carries on with where he left off beside partner Ellie at the end of Ice Age 2. He is, of course, part of a group of three including Diego (Leary) and Sid (Leguizamo), the respective sabre toothed tiger and sloth; Diego of whom sees little future in his current predicament with these guys (facing an impending child on the scene/Sid's slapstick antics), and longs for an adventure as gags about old age and domestic suffocation rear up. Wouldn't you know it, Sid goes missing on account of a Tyrannosaurus Rex taking him after he stole, and then observed hatch, her eggs – thus, it's up to these remaining characters as well as the Seann William Scott and Josh Peck voiced quick-fire critters we were introduced to in the second film to tag along and save him. Upon stumbling upon a previously unaccounted jungle dominated world below the surface, they hook up with Simon Pegg's survivalist weasel Buck, who acts as their guide through the terrain. Interestingly, when we first encounter him, it is a recreation of the very instance Sam Neill's Dr. Grant character is rescued from all manner of prehistoric beats by the very boy he is involuntarily searching for in Jurassic Park III. As soon as those gas canisters go off, it is revealed to us right where we are in relation to this new addition and we ease into it in that sense.It comes as a relief that we can slog through this sort of film once again after the tedious disaster that was Ice Age 2. This is funnier and more exciting, with a lot of adventure to be had out of it. There is an urgency to things this time, a huge dinosaur akin to Jurassic Park III's Spinosaurus is on their tail and that element of chase works better here than it did in number two, when flesh-hungry fish were gobbling up anything foolish enough not to respect the fact there was a massive thaw swallowing everything up behind them. Where things break down in this sense of children and adults liking the same content, however, are in the scenes when Manfred mulls over potential fatherhood; while few people below a certain age will get quite the desired kick out of seeing Buck emerge from a muddy swamp alá Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now.Few people would argue against the recurring squirrel character Scrat being the funniest thing in any of the films, but where it is often advised in any walk of life not to try and mend things that are not broken, the film decides to revamp his own on-going crusade to finally snare an acorn he's been forever been attempting to obtain. The overlying joke inherent with this skit was always the cruel denial after the apparent security one would obtain what one wants, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs vamping up the core of the gag in their introducing of a female foil for Scrat; a sort of odd mesh of the Cadbury's Caramel Bunny with the jagged, brisk animations that came with the central characters from Disney's 1963 film The Sword in the Stone upon transformation into squirrels. Thus, these sequences have mutated into an odd, borderline bawdy, tease-and-denial routine wherein the laughs come hearty and somewhat regular, but with that nagging sensation at the back of one's mind as one realises this is a kids film. Regardless, the film is so much fun and is so immune to doing any wrong, that they've managed to mess around with the franchise's best and most popular item and still just about get it right.",6,1,1,5 March 2013
Space Jam," Falling in the shadow of what preceded it and relying on its heightened USP to drive its shoddy narrative, Space Jam just abouts gets by on novelty and energy.
","It's difficult to find a stone wall resting place upon which to perch one's self in regards to Space Jam, a film with an immense amount of charm in its thrashing together of live action sporting super stars and the Looney Tunes brigade, although it does come with an equal amount of flaw. This is not, of course, the first time we've seen live action and animation blend together like this; 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the film that immediately springs to mind, and throughout Space Jam it is tough to rid it from one's head once it's in there. The bad news is that Space Jam is a film which needs its cartoonified contingent in order to be at all interesting, whereas you're able to get so wrapped up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit that it's easy to forget you're even watching a live action cross-pollination. In short: you could remove the animated characters from Bob Zemeckis' minor masterpiece and still be caught up in a central character confronting his grief; alcoholism and prejudices as a twisting, adult narrative unfolds around him. Remove the 'toons from this similarly pitched 1996 effort, and you get the likes of Michael Jordan mugging his way through some awkward green-screen routines and a dull circular narrative about him rediscovering his love for the game of basketball.Ah, yes: Michael Jordan. There are certain personalities in certain sports you've just 'heard of', regardless of the sport in question. At the time of the film's production, names synonymous with the likes of golf, tennis and football might very well have been Nicklaus; Sampras and Pele – in Jordan (of whom even I have heard, and I know nothing of the game of basketball) we have a mainstream figure dropped into the centre of a film arriving will all the baggage; hysteria and reputation that comes with him on top of that buzz of seeing cartoon characters that have been famous for as many as three times the number of years Jordan has even existed. Indeed, in case you were not already aware: Jordan is a superstar; a man whose achievements in basketball open the film in montage format. We observe the trophies he's won, the millions of adoring fans he's garnered and even the Olympic medals he's picked up.Jordan, however, is tired of basketball; a premise to this 'character's' existence which might ordinarily be greeted with scoffing and furrowed brows as this stinking rich superstar slumps into an apparent pit of discontent at a life of being suffocated by those around him and adorned just a tad too much by his peers. That is, if we weren't already aware he did indeed grow weary of said lifestyle and thus moved briefly into baseball. Meanwhile, narrative and conflict arrives in the form of a slimy alien creature voiced by Danny de Vito; an alien who owns a theme park on a planet many moons away. He's in monetary trouble, and proposes to his equally bug-like accomplices that they travel to Planet Earth; warp their way, somehow, into our television sets (which apparently hold the key to entry into the programmes aided therein); kidnap an array of the Looney Tunes and bring them back so that they may act as a permanent feature to the theme park, thus reigniting business.So far, so Looney. The 'toons have an issue with being thrust from their home in order to be taken to somewhere else so that they may perform the same gags over and over again to an ogling audience.....wait-a-second, isn't that what they do anyway? In light of it all, they propose a basketball match with the gribblies: if they win, they stay here; if they lose, they'll pack up and come with them for eternal slavery. Thudding into the narrative hub lumbers Jordan, a basketball player the 'toons recruit equating to certain success, right? Not necessarily: the small, slug like aliens steal the 'talents' of various then NBA professionals before growing themselves to a larger scale into order to win the bet.The film is mostly underdog fluff, but underdog fluff made a little more interesting than usual with the presence of people such as Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck going up against these third party extra-terrestrials, furthermore aided by that basketball player you've probably heard of and that bloke out of Jurassic Park and Basic Instinct. The film's droll liberal agenda dominates proceedings more than any sort of interest in the result or anything else; this is ultimately a film about people and creatures from all walks of life coming together and working as a team, whereas the only 'winner' (without giving anything away) is basketball (or more specifically: 'sports') itself. The framework about Jordan playing for a cause as worthy as the one wherein he defends a group of little animals from hulking monsters, thus rediscovering his love for the game of basketball, is as meek and as plodding as it sounds whereas one scene wherein a character verbally runs through all the companies & products Jordan has previously endorsed is disturbingly ambiguous in regards to whether it's lampooning how much Jordan has sold out or is just guilt edged product placement. No matter, the film is a blast; the match itself is constructed with energy and verve, while the makers manage to slide in a new Warner Brother's Looney Tune altogether in the form of Lola Bunny - someone who's fresh and fun and doesn't discredit the old guard. Like most of these sorts of things, you'd need to be pretty sniffy to not enjoy it. I went with it, and enjoyed it.",6,3,4,4 February 2013
Before Sunrise," The best film you're likely to find with the most basic of plots and fewest characters
","Unless you're actually doing something such as watching a film or reading a book, train journeys can seem rather dull. This simple yet now effective fact is used to kick start one of the most underrated, unknown yet oddly attractive films of the 1990's and possibly of all time.The train has been used as a setting in film for decades and romance is never too far away when it is the setting; whether it features in 'Some Like it Hot' (1959) and Jack Lemmon's undeniable attraction to Sugar Kane or in this film: Before Sunrise; a simple yet effective romantic drama (not a comedy) revolving solely around a mere two people and their seemingly random conversations.A film like this one does not have to be glamorous. It does not need to draw the audience in with spectacular visuals or dramatic opening sequences nor does it need to introduce a number of different characters through dialogue or otherwise to prove its point. Instead it takes a 'fly on the wall' approach. Wherever our hero's go; we go. Whatever our hero's hear; we hear. Whatever our hero's talk about; we listen and this carries on throughout. The early portion of this film is fairly light-hearted, even fun. The two people obviously have never spoken to one another in their lives and the seemingly nervous banter early on is real ice-breaker stuff which reeks of originality. The dialogue is original and uses a technique only really exploited with any real mainstream purpose by Tarantino whom, himself, was still basking in the glory of 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) which had only been around for a solitary year when this was made and released. In fact, Ethan Hawke's character's acting and much of his dialogue will remind you of Tarantino himself in the way in which he delivers his lines early on! The nervousness which Celine (Delpy) gives off is counter acted with the rather disturbing confidence that Jesse (Hawke) has throughout the opening half an hour of this film and it creates a rather fascinating juxtaposition as the two counteract each other. Here we have two seemingly complete strangers sharing pretty personal information, pretty early on in the 'relationship' and you really have to watch as to what might happen next. Will Celine accept what this rough, tough looking American has to say? Or will the character slap him and get off at the next tram stop? Interesting stuff as any thing can happen given the fact everything is happening in real time and in a very simple/real environment  no strings attached. This creates a good atmosphere and is complimented by the long takes which stretch out our interest.Once off the train (or any other transport) the normal, familiar settings of a town/cityscape has never worked so well when in conjunction with a story as pleasant or as natural as this. The city; albeit with all its culture, beauty and so fourth - never seems too glamorous nor does it act as an arrogant, over the top setting for a story so subtle as this one yet at the same, it's more than just 'effective'.Given the simplicity of the film, there are flaws. One thing that really bothered me and seemed a little too convenient was that of the bilingual tramp/artist whom they both met during the evening. That seemed a little too forced and a little too coincidental for me, even though the whole premise is, in fact, coincidence as that's how they meet in the first place. Another thing is the certain arrogance the camera takes on. The long takes seem to drag on a little during the film, especially when we are not given any interesting background to catch a breather from. This includes the pinball machine scene in the club and should be compared to the tram scene from earlier on in the film. During these bad examples, the actors seem a little less bothered and the dialogue starts to grate a little which is not a pleasant experience. At least in 'Pulp Fiction', the characters are almost always moving on to the next setting, there's always a bit of colour or background activity and there's no annoying pinball machine noises to distract you! Overall, if you like to travel a lot or if you've visited mainland Europe before or maybe even gone through something like this yourself, you'll like this film. Don't expect anything fantastic, just a decent, well made romance which uses its settings and situation to good effect AND that leaves a fair bit of ambiguity in the air afterwards.",7,1,4,5 July 2006
Signs," Well worth it if you're into spooky, eerie films that cover horror and science fiction.
","Signs is the third film from Shyamalan and the third that I've seen from him. After an impressive debut with The Sixth Sense and a horrid more recent instalment called Lady in the Water, Signs is actually somewhere in the middle in terms of overall quality. It takes some conventions from both films but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has all the slow, character driven build up revolving around a single setting (like in Lady in the Water) but it also has, at times, that eerie, uncanny feeling The Sixth Sense contained.The mystery surrounding the odd circles found outside is interesting and maintains a healthy amount of suspense and intrigue. Something a little more disturbing and unsettling, however, is a lot more closer to home. The amount of glasses of water that build up inside the house and the way in which the very young little girl claims that 'they're contaminated' or something to that effect is something very simple done in a very eerie way. It's complemented by the lighting and the way nobody in the family ever smiles or seems happy.As the film unfolds, clues are presented to us and the characters but neither of us are entirely sure of what is going on. The baby monitor is a good example. Up to this point, nobody in the world knows who's doing what or what is going on but over this family's baby monitor, there are some eerie, odd sounding noises that one member of the family actually identifies. Some other family members have other ideas and even we; the audience are allowed to make of it what we will which I thought was quite clever.Onto the characters and the children in particular: the kids seem to be too smart for their own good. Where the adults and brothers of Graham Hess (Gibson) and Merrill Hess (Phoenix) are busy suspecting rival neighbour farmers; the children are busy reading up on extra-terrestrials and solving it themselves  this is also hinted at later on in the film when Merrill is watching television (allowing people to tell him what to make of it all) whilst the children are busy predicting what the crop circles mean and what might happen next - they're often correct, as well.As Signs builds and builds, its divulge into past events that explain the undeniable feeling of depression in the house is cleverly revealed as is the tension built up for the film's climax which plays out like Night of the Living Dead or quite possibly any film from the 'Dead' trilogy. I'm not too sure how I'd react in a situation like that involving basements and extra terrestrials but I know for one thing that I'd have some sort of weapon lined up  this is tackled later on but only when the pressure is off to a certain extent and when they're out-numbering the critters.Signs is a good film on the whole, with some impressive tension built up along with good lighting, likable characters that you get a feel for and some clues thrown in at the beginning that add up very simply if thought through.",7,1,8,26 June 2007
The Deer Hunter," Somewhat powerful but very important look on how Vietnam affected even those from the very small areas of society.
","I suppose The Deer Hunter's basic three act structure is a fairly basic and easy thing to spot, but the film makes full use of it in the long run. Such is the power and the eeriness of this film, it was not until a few days after I had seen it that the film began to strike a cord with me. Yes, I saw it; really enjoyed it and when the climactic scene came and went, it was heart breaking but at the time I could not accept that it had just happened. Fast forward three or four days later, re-visit the theme tune as produced by Myers/Williams and actually think about what had transpired and it is a shocking and unpleasant feeling that dawns on you.The Deer Hunter at its very core is an obvious commentary on how the Vietnam War as a whole destroyed the people who fought in it. The film is about how the war arrived just when so many people were getting in right and were enjoying themselves without a care in the world right until something as unnecessary and as brutal as the war comes along to destroy it. When Michael (De Niro), Steven (Calzale) and Nick (Walken) finish their front line duty in 'Nam, their lives are changed; so much so that despite being home or at least within the boundaries of a space that is not the war itself, they cannot or find it difficult to re-adapt  Nick for psychological reasons, Steven for physical reasons and Michael just about gets by, but he is still haunted by the actions of his clumsy and now apparent immature friends.And so it is at this point that I give an opinion that will seem insulting and derogatory but is just a humble observation; The Deer Hunter viewed now, structurally, resembles that nasty little horror sub-genre called 'torture porn'. Maybe it is the recent spate of films of this sub-genre, but The Deer Hunter begins with utopia (at least for the characters) before descending into Hell and then ending with a reprieve as well as having to come to terms with what has happened once you were dragged from your utopian haven. For the first third, the characters that are the steel workers are happy and carefree with frequent trips to the bar and jokes with fellow co-workers the enjoyable level of their lives. This sequence feels warm and it feels friendly, lulling us into a false sense. Then there is the wedding; supposedly the happiest moment of anybody's life and once again, the dizziest high achievable is shown and exploited in the opening third  it can only go down from here. Then there is the eerie way Nick and Michael seem to gamble; they gamble on the football game on TV but they gamble with their lives when they undertake a truck on the road  this toying with fate and their lives echoes in future scenes, but it will mature them in the nastiest way possible.There is also the attitude the characters have toward the wedding; this is where The Deer Hunter edges toward the brink of being political. The manner in which the guys fool around and treat a big deal like the wedding in such a carefree manner might be echoing America's methods of dealing with the Vietnam War; 'underestimation' the key word here. But this works both ways, it can be a political statement but it can also act as a brilliant sentimental set up. I especially liked the scenes in which the guys sing to the music and play pool at the same time; it is something most men have done, play pool, whilst the apparent unnecessary action may be questioned; after later events it is something the guys will not be able to partake in ever again  enjoy it and do not question it while it lasts because one day, it may be an impossibility.Then onto the second act and the war itself in which buildings are eviscerated and people are killed. Michael must torch someone alive with a flamethrower and march about seeing other such Americans lie in waste as a result of gunfights. But the capture and the subsequent 'torture' of the protagonists is what people remember the film for. The scenes work because you don't want these characters to be slapped about, treated this way and be shot. True, the 'evil' Vietnamese and the 'good' and innocent Americans are categorised here but I do not feel the representation can be criticised if it is a war zone in which the events are set, with two sides warring with one another. This roulette sequence important because it plays a large role in Nick's future mentality; the scene when he breaks down in hospital is perhaps a realisation of what he went through and for some reason, he must constantly face these demons in future roulette games.When said people do make it home, it is not the fun and games it was. Axel (Aspegren) and Stan (Cazale) are waiting there, no surprise the film did not bring the two least likable guys along with them to the war, and no surprise Michael gets agitated with them when he does, especially when Stan shows off his revolver. The Deer Hunter further intrudes into the political when it includes, I believe to be, real life images and footage of news reports during the war amongst the action. But the film will remain strong and haunting enough for time to age it in that powerful and important manner.",8,0,1,9 April 2008
Identity," Although well shot and unfolded, the film is too ambiguous and not concrete enough to satisfy the basic of requirements in its genre.
","I can certainly see what writer Michael Cooney and director James Mangold were trying here with Identity; a thriller-come-whodunit set in an isolated motel in the back o' beyond, but to me the end result falls flat and it falls sort of its attempted goal. I think Identity is a refreshing attempt at a genre that, let's face it, has been done close to death with numerous persons all gathering at a required place in order to be picked off one by one.The characters seemingly doomed in this particular tale to not submit to the usual stereotypes but they manage to take part in and create a series of annoying trends that have you dislike them. I suppose I was expecting characters in the form of: the black guy; the sluttish girl; the sexually active couple, the male of said two-some takes an attraction to the sluttish girl and vice-versa; the wise old character and some sort of stoner in his twenties. For the film not to have this sort of a cast of people was a relief but to have the ensuing story revolving around what we're given owes a lot to characters and their, quite frankly, stupid behaviour at times with people storming out and acting like children despite a killer on the loose. It is not until the authoritarian figure of former cop Ed (Cusack) tells them to stay put, like children at a primary school, until they all settle down.And then there is the character of Ed; an interesting one at that solely for the reason the twist that this film has revolves around him, but I won't say any more. What I will say revolves around Ed as a character and how the film is told from his point of view. This is no spoiler because the film makes it obvious to any active film watcher watching Identity since the film is told from Ed's point of view. We know this because he has everything a nice guy could have. He's nice, good natured, kind, educated and is involved in practically every scene. When someone is bleeding, he is the one that knows how to stitch them up; when someone dies, he's the one that does the police work and when everything needs to be sorted out and people need to be calmed down and organised, he's there to steady the ship. Ed is so fantastic that he is even able to tell us how much a room at the motel actually costs for one night since it says so on the billboard at the entrance; let that be a clue.Following the obligatory start this film has during which the phones don't work (obviously) and the electricity fails after a while, the film would have us transported back to a board room where officials argue over weather to execute a mass-murder. The question that I, and probably the film, fail to grasp is: are the events at the hotel even real? Is any of it actually happening and if so, why are we even seeing it? Yes, Identity is sort of a film about stuff that didn't really happen, or did it? This is no Usual Suspects but it so desperately wants to be given a suspected criminal is in a police station telling us all what's what. Regarding the actual killer who you will only know if you read this after having seen the film, I cannot fathom any incentive for said events to happen and said character(s) to do what he/she/it/they did. It just doesn't make sense but then again, it is age old memories of a psycho, isn't it? On an aesthetical level, Identity works but its narrative and consistency with what's what doesn't make sense. Towards the end of the film, one girl even states that the whole situation is 'like something out of a movie'. Too true as she goes onto state that in 'said movie' people were gathered at a certain place because they all had something in common. Now, providing this person even existed in real life or whether she existed through imagination alone; how the hell do you explain what she actually says actually forming the basis for the film's final act? Either this is incredible sloppy writing where they have rather obviously run out of ideas and are actually using another film to bail them out OR it's a clever piece of writing where the person having a supposed flashback is mixing up a film they might have once seen and using it to carry out the conclusion of the nightmare. This raises two questions: 1. How would a death row inmate be able to recollect a film they MIGHT have seen years ago and be able to adapt it into their own fantasy? 2. What film was it they're thinking of? My guess is 1945's The Spiral Staircase which I saw several months ago but it is a very, very long shot.Like I said, the person is able to inform us what the motel's rates are. Based on this, it seems they're also able to recollect everything from the colour of the curtains right down to what people were wearing and driving since we're seeing it. But then the argument again surfaces: did any of it even happen? There are enough incidences of reality being broken to suggest it didn't. While Identity isn't an awful film, it is a confusing and an ambiguous one; one that does not have a satisfying enough pay off to warrant a re-watch and one that fails in what it tries to achieve. Not an embarrassment for all involved but one that will get some people rather excited.",5,2,7,13 January 2008
Beowulf," Dull and stupid when it isn't just unnecessarily disgusting, Beowulf is a puerile and aimless film without an audience nor much of a brain.
","I think amidst the corny script; odd looking human-being/CGI animated character processing and daft action sequences, the makers of Beowulf had most fun rendering and toying with Angelina Jolie's semi-naked body as she slithers out of a pool of water in some cave half way through the film. They had more fun rendering it and patching stuff over what I presume to have been a green-screen suited Jolie than I did watching it – like Halle Berry's weaving; swaying; slinking; decked up like a fetishists wet-dream Catwoman from a 2004 film of the same name, the most remarkable thing about the whole sequence is the sense of just not caring what it is that's being presented to you on screen, despite the promise on paper of something slightly eye-catching. Such is the reaction to the text, or indeed the particular bringing to life of the text, that the people making it had a better time in making and messing around with it than we did watching it.Robert Zemeckis can often be a curious director, his blending of content fit for both grown-ups and kids alike have seen him take on an array of past projects; ranging from the typically noir-infused shenanigans of 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit? which blended this with the persistent inclusion of cartoon characters; to the romp that was 1985's Back to the Future, yes, a somewhat child orientated time travel romp about a high-schooler, but one that saw a younger edition of the lead's mother fall in love with him: a premise, I read, deemed too risqué by Disney at the time whom promptly rejected the project. This, as well as 1994's Forrest Gump; a film that shoots along at a merry old pace under a grandeur of sweet natured comedy but taking time to encompass some pretty adult orientated material – most of us saw said film when we were younger, but how many of us really understood or knew what was going on during Jenny's sequences of downward spiralling through drug addiction and all things nasty? But I like these three examples, and Zemeckis' direction in his ability to mould all these things together worked.Then comes 2007's Beowulf, a film too adult most of the time for younger viewers in its scares; humour; imagery and sexual innuendo but just too adolescent at others for adults in its stupefying action sequences; bodily function orientated humour and general sense of childishness. Unlike past attempts at this hybridising, Zemeckis falls well short and by the time the credits ran, I just felt embarrassed for all involved. Based on a centuries old poem-come-story, but penned by way of Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary, the film covers the exploits of Ray Winstone's Viking warrior Beowulf in the 6th Century, as a sort of one time mercenary whose skills are recognised enough so as to pass on into royalty. In Denmark, a drinking hall full of individuals led by Hrothgar (Hopkins) sing and display characteristics of lust, gluttony and greed as food is devoured; riches casually distributed and women rendered prizes as they're leered over. Enter twelve foot or so man/demon Grendel (Glover), who promptly massacres all involved before retiring to the cavern in which the aforementioned Jolie, his mother, resides. This raises the question as to whether his mother appears in front of him in the same form as she does to Winstone later on. If so, it's no wonder the kid's got issues.In true pantomime fashion, 'We need a hero!' is the cry. Cut to man of the hour and title Beowulf, standing nonchalantly on a boat in a terrible storm; those around him struggling to deal with the conditions; but Beowulf merely cackles at the wind and rain, establishing in a very basic manner a sense of masculinity and fearlessness. 'I've come to kill yor' monsta'' so says Beowulf upon arrival, and the ensuing fight with Grendel is a would-be interesting sequence that brings you right out of the picture by persistently reminding you of the Austin Powers censoring sequence as naked individuals waltz around in a film that doesn't allow nudity. As the film rolls on, it wants to think that it has a fascinating and tense pot-boiler up its sleeve involving Beowulf and Grendel's mother after a meeting and agreement between the two, but the resulting suspense born out of this item that's gone on for years is about as enthralling as watching a CGI axe meekly splash down into a shallow puddle on a gravelly beach. Where the film ought to be tense and unnerving, it merely carries an uncanniness born out of observing these semi-CGI Vikings mope around in next to nothing on.Throughout, since I'm nowhere near interested in what's going on, I wondered if other people in other nations around the world existed, and if they did, I wondered if they have too had any issues with monsters and beasties terrorising them. But in essentially aiming the film at a younger based audience, Neanderthal attitudes towards women and the general behaviour of most of the characters are made to look 'funny', as this filtering through crisp animation is played out in what is a rather disgusting; ill-advised and irresponsible display of film-making on Zemeckis' behalf. Shame, as intense and adult dramas such as Cast Away are not beyond the reach of the man; in the meantime I guess we'll have to settle for bizarre amalgamations designed to make money and con people into thinking they're seeing something more interesting than what it is by way of special effects and three dimensions.",5,0,1,14 April 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard for a new, more juvenalised, generation of American action genre movie goers which offers little more than surface thrills and blunt nostalgia.
","John McLane's calm demeanour greets us on the poster for Die Hard 4.0, as sparks fly; chaos unfolds and all Hell breaks loose around him, his pained but calmed expression is a measure of where the man's been and how far he's come since first encountering a hostile situation alÃ¡ of the above. It's a feeling that resonates in the film, we've been here and done this in films not limited to the Die Hard series; that unfortunate and frustrating sensation that the franchise has now been limited to a bankable actioner call-upon feeling ever prominent as 4.0 gradually rolls towards its inevitable conclusion. The Die Hard series, particularly the first, was always about McLane being in the wrong place-at the wrong time, with this idea gradually becoming less and less prominent as, particularly by the time of number three, we saw McLane being used more and more as an action lead ever dependant on being in the right place-at the right time. Here, we are ever-increasingly reliant on McLane as an action lead who is engineered to further plot and maintain his ability to be in the right place and the right time. If there was a time to momentarily weep for the Die Hard franchise, it's here but if ever there was a time to meekly appreciate a well enough made actioner, then it is here also.I read that director Len Wiseman grew up on the original Die Hard films, going so far as to produce his own amateur Die Hard films as a teen with home-based cameras. He wisely refrains from attempting to go above the first Die Hard; a visual demonstration of this evident in McLane's ploughing through a Nakatomi Plaza style room whilst in a vehicle so as to defeat an enemy in what is a sequence driven more by spectacle and basic action infused thrills than what might have happened in the first, where vulnerability and fear in the lead was more omnipresent. Wiseman instills a certain sense of the building doubling up as that Nakatomi high-rise in having Mclane engage in a fight on the stairs on the way up, one of which is eerily reminiscent of his coming together with Karl's brother in the first.Wiseman's film is littered with that unprecedented sense of nostalgia; nostalgia which almost certainly resonates within both most of the adult watching audience as much as it is the director himself. While the undeniable sense of pleasingness in observing Willis doing his thing, in a vest, charging around and thwarting terrorists in the process is an unmitigated joy, the question as to what is the point remains. Where the first Die Hard held up the proverbial mirror to both the action genre and the action lead; the fourth film is all too happy to conform to generic expectation, the shark well and truly air-bound by the time McLane is sliding down a fighter plane after having out-driven it in a large truck before picking himself up; dusting himself off and consequently ready for the next episodic fight scene.The joy is in the nostalgia, and observing a rather basic narrative of heroes and villains duking it out amidst explosions and action; it just so happens this particular episode of good and evil having a right go of it has Willis' John McLane involved. The film revolves around McLane and a young hacker named Matthew Farrell (Long), whom he is charged with protecting, following a hacking into the U.S. government's mainframe and the suspicious eliminating of several other hackers capable of executing such a stunt. For grizzled veterans of the series, McLane is your man; that sense of juvenalisation settling in on the Die Hard franchise evident in the inclusion of Farrell whom is for those new to the series and in need of someone young enough and fresh faced enough to identify with. A minor distinction is made early on between the two of them regarding the sorts of rock music they like, with McLane more inclined towards 'classical' orientated rock whereby Farrell's tastes are that of the awful grungy, 'hard' rock we hear him listening to when first observing him.Their plight involves a disgruntled American computer wizard named Thomas Gabriel (Olyphant), whom once worked for the American government, but now aims to work against them in holding the nation to ransom for a large sum of money - in the immortal words of McLane himself 'All this for a robbery!?'. Olyphant appears to channel Die Hard 2's chief antagonist Colonol Stuart in his mannerisms and behaviour, the tale of his team of technological experts holding a mass amount of people to ransom as the technologically defunct McLane gets stuck in the middle lifted straight out of said sequel. His cold, harsh blues are in stark contrast to McLane's more normalised hues when they face off over a web-cam and one point in which he will call one of his minions only to have McLane answer back serves only to remind you of the time it happens in the first Die Hard; when a sarcastic McLane asks whether Karl and Hans are lonely. With immense technological power at his fingertips and an army of, oddly, French mercenaries at his disposal, he's most certainly acts as enough of a threat. Director Wiseman's references towards the earlier entries is somewhat incessant, his referencing goes down awkwardly at times and even spills off away from its nostalgic purpose into the primary strands of the film. This is particularly evident towards the finale when McLane's prior estrangement from a family member in his daughter Lucy (Winstead), rather than wife Holly, drives the denouement thus consistently reminding us of the first film. Here, much unlike her mother, Lucy is just a pretty face that needs rescuing; something that only aids in illustrating how much the first Die Hard was actually about something. Here, a lot of that has gone and the result is somewhat frustrating.",6,1,3,9 October 2010
X2: X-Men United," The upping of the stakes and the going overboard of the sub-plots has the X-Men sequel just about pull through with an array of frequently imbalanced material.
","Was the title 'X-Men 2' really so long that we needed it abbreviated to form 'X2'? As it happens, Bryan Singer's 2003 follow up to the reasonably pleasing a film from 2000 entitled X-Men is a little longer and a little baggier in its biting off more for us to chew on. Wheter it pulls off everything it decides to take on is one matter, whether it does it at all well another; the fact remaining right the way through to its closing credits that some of the more ordinary stuff on show is explored and granted much more time than some of the other content which may have been interesting. Sure, it has its shocks and its twists but it has its tendencies to conform and that's the most frustrating thing. Regardless, from its dramatic opening sequence of a mutant and his attempted 'hit' on the life of a fictitious American president, to the closing allegorical monologue from said man about mutants with clear allusions to the item of terrorism as we're told to 'acknowledge' this new phenomenon, X2 is an enjoyable if draggy experience which hits enough notes.The bigger picture and generally wider spectrum of both character and narrative Singer was quite clearly setting up in the first film is here granted the room to flex its muscles. X2 sees an expansion in stakes and general atmosphere, a spreading out of its wings so as to encompass an all out war between human-beings and mutants when tempers fray between the species, corrupt government officials manipulate the circumstances around them and hardened relations between those within the fractions become greater. The film hops about all over the place in attempting to cover and develop each of the little sub-stories it's got going on, and it does a decent job of it overall. The strand running central, to all of Wolverine's (Jackman) journey of discovery as he tries to uncover how he became what he is; the love he has for Jean Grey (Janssen) but the love she has for Cyclops (Marsden) as well as Rouge's (Paquin) romance with Iceman (Ashmore) which interestingly runs on an idea revolving around how great harm will come to both of them if they kiss or attempt to express their love for one-another at such an age, is the captivity of chief Mutant villain Magneto (McKellen).Regardless of what people think, the film channels The Silence of the Lambs and the imprisonment of Hannibal Lecter in Magneto's clothing; cell and demeanour. It's nice of the asylum staff to play him classical music seemingly on cue, and while it isn't The Goldberg Variations by Bach, it might as well be. The consistent presence of Brian Cox, whom actually portrayed Lecter in an earlier novel incarnation, adds further mirth to proceedings when there really ought not be any. Magneto's being held by a top American military official named William Stryker (Cox), whom wants nothing more than to stoke the fire between the two species. For Stryker, it's less-so business in his feuding with the mutants and more-so personal; his son, Jason, once a subject of Xavier's mutant school only to come home thoroughly less than well off and grossly affect the family situation as a result. We're told to conclude that Stryker is more evil than at first when it transpires he keeps a bunch of kidnapped infant mutants in a grim little cell within a secluded Arctic-like base much later on.Like X-Men; the mutant's apparent superiority over the human's is presented, not by way of the imperious lead of the first in Wolverine as he wins bare knuckle boxing match after bare knuckle boxing match in an unruly part of town, but by way of new German mutant Nightcrawler (Cumming) and the aforementioned attempt on the American President's life. We sense trouble is unavoidably afoot after digesting such a sequence following on from an opening voice-over from the anchor character of the films so far in Professor Xavier (Stewart) while skirmishes out in the public eye do nothing to help. The sole surviving aide to Magneto from the first film arrives in the many forms of Mystique (Romijn), the earlier film going some way to paint freakish and disfigured portraits of Magneto's other aides with Xavier's then-and-now subjects much more handsome and more beautiful in their appearance. Here, all mutants are briefly aligned and the film has fun in its retaining of the one bodily 'scarred' character from the first, whom just happens to be able to change form as temporary new identities and allies themselves are forged. Singer has additional fun in constructing suspenseful sequences in which Mystique must infiltrate government zones and we have to remind ourselves that we want her to get away with it.Alas, each and every one of the strands X2 takes on seems to overwhelm the next; the film hints at some bigger, brasher and more interesting things when one younger mutant is discussing the correlation between his mutant persona and human-being persona with the all powerful Magneto. The inference being that it's probably better to be 'Pyro' than 'John Allerdyce'. The film is a flabby actioner, its meshing of content for all ages ranging from the adolescent with the more adult to the fact veteran actors Patrick Stewart; Ian McKellen and Brian Cox all feature prominently making for an odd experience of action orientated frills and more mature issues. Its formulaic finale and gradually more and more conformist to spectacle attitude is one of its more chief faults, but there is edible entertainment to be had out of X2; a digestible comic book adaptation from a director we feel relaxed to be in the hands of.",6,0,1,7 October 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars crash-lands back into people's consciousness's, not with a bang, but with an oddly detached re-telling.
","There's no time travelling in Star Wars, is there? No, didn't think so. Watching 'Episode 7: The Force Awakens', however, the much anticipated 2015 continuation of the original trilogy, you would think you'd been thrown back to 1977 and were watching, in some alternate dimension, a re-run of the very first film itself. Sceptics have been writing for years on the 'place' Hollywood blockbusters have in the canon of film as an art-form, deriding them for being derivative, or for too often coming to form replications of each other, but this really does take the space-cake. The film is, in fact, so reminiscent in certain places of Episode IV that you might just as well call it An 'Old' Hope.The film begins with a mother-ship's silhouette blotting out a sun and the launch of a series of spaceships which head down to a nearby planet. The bigger ship, belonging to The First Order, which has risen out of the ashes of Darth Vader's old Evil Empire, in doing so infers a powerful ability to blot out or ruin anything it comes into contact with. Inside one of the smaller ships, the populous is cleverly introduced via some flickered lighting, which actually alludes to a later crisis of conscience one of the inhabitants will have. Once on the surface, they ambush a village with connections to the Resistance in looking for a piece of a map which will, apparently, direct them to the legendary Luke Skywalker, who, being the last Jedi, will win the war for the Dark once and for all if they find and kill him. At the last moment, a pilot called Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) hides the portion inside a small robot who escapes with it.Enter the protagonist, Rey (Daisy Ridley); a young-ish orphan, who should probably look grubbier and uglier, living on the same planet and who trades in scrap from crashed spaceships of the first war for portions of food. Her literal harvesting of these parts from old cruisers of the first three films is, in some ways, a reflection of how the film itself is taking from past efforts. Into her world ambles said droid and the map, and then later still the character of Finn (John Boyega), who is a storm trooper for the Dark but decides to change sides. Finn's introduction to the film, like Rey's, is a slow unsheathing of a mask or helmet to reveal the face in close-up, inferring a kind of duality or connection - sure enough, they spend the majority of the film together and become close allies.Dodging the incoming First Order, the two make off with one of the more famous pieces of Star Wars paraphernalia which they find lying around in the area, Rey demonstrating piloting skills you would have thought were beyond her without the ability to practise to any degree. After breaking down in outer space, they are caught up by two familiar faces in Chewbacca and Harrison Ford's Han Solo, who have become, in the years since the war, interstellar versions of long distance truckers. Their haul on this particular occasion are large man eating squid-like monsters. Do we think they'll escape and wreak havoc, or not? What do you think? The film then becomes somewhat of a race to rebel HQ, with the villains never too far from their tails. Later on, attention shifts to a weapon of mass destruction the First Order possess which, despite existing in the shadow of the old Empire, is ten times more powerful.The film is not a disaster by any means, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I think it probably attempts to cram too much in for it to feel like a work of real substance: the decision by a trooper to defect; a sub-plot to do with a father/son relationship; the foiling of an evil scheme; the rekindling of two old flames in Solo and a certain Princess. Its approach is too pulpy to take seriously; I felt its introduction of Rey and her lonely world, a stretch of film that is told visually without dialogue for a about two minutes, could have gone on for another ten, while its finale is similar to, but probably not as thrilling as, 1996's 'Independence Day' with its final assault unfolding in conjunction with a dogfight.Then there is the issue of one particular cast member who had already said he didn't want to be a part of the franchise after this edition, so his character has been written out. This is sad for the fact we lose an old face, yes; but it also demeans the artistic pursuit of direction and damages the concept of auteurism. When decisions to take a project in particular direction are made by these means, and not by a creative vision, just what are we even left watching?Essentially, 'The Force Awakens' is a re-treading of Lucas' initial 1977 effort: the message being hidden in a droid; the Vader-style villain in black turning up with his troopers looking for it; the young desert-dwelling hero bumping into it; the stumbling into an intergalactic adventure; the tracking shot through the Cantina-style bar, etc. What is new is not even necessarily new either: a post-Hunger Games style heroine and a post-Wall*E style droid hardly blow us away. For all the crowing on increased diversity, read Manthia Diawara's 1988 essay 'Black Spectatorship: Problems of Identification & Resistance' on black and white characters sharing the screen for problems linked to John Boyega's casting. Diawara's observations of things in '48 Hours'; 'Beverly Hills Cop' and 'Rocky II' might just as well be applied here, particularly during the climactic lightsaber fight. What 'progress' has even been made? In the end, JJ Abrams has created a decent actioner and provided us with the buzz of seeing some old faces, but nothing much else.",6,1,1,23 September 2019
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," No, this doesn't quite 'catch fire', but it is a solid piece of dystopian-set action film-making
","How much you like 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' will depend heavily on whether you took to the first film - that is to say, if you did not, then you will curse having to sit through two hours or so here of what is essentially the same content retreated, if not entirely rerun. As far as I can care enough to ascertain, there are two major differences between this entry and its 2012 predecessor: firstly, the fighting arena has changed and now consists of a strange clock-like locality wherein various threats to all are triggered at specific times in order to make the contest a little more interesting; and secondly, the fighters involved are all former champions, so the stakes and intensity are increased.For the totally uninitiated, 'The Hunger Games' unfolds in a cruel English-speaking autocracy which consists of various districts in what is either the far future or a parallel universe. The society prides itself on a kind of faux-patriotism, or po-faced ideas linked to national identity, which are connected to unparalleled honour to the state and its premier as well as its militaristic history and seemed to come out best (or worst) in various Communist societies throughout history: think Cuba or North Korea. At the peak of its powers, the Soviet Union was probably one of the most patriotic nations on Earth. The eponymous Games are a yearly contest whereby a male and a female between the ages of 12 and 18 are selected at random from the aforementioned districts to fight until only one remains - is entwined with the essence of the characteristics that are meant to make up the core of the nation's citizens by Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland), its President.Having been the one to have survived the slog of going through with this in the first film, the conspicuously named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) lives a life in her village not too detached to that of what she would be doing anyway prior to the first film's events, but with this new-found (and thoroughly unwanted) stardom. Living it with her is Peeta, played by Josh Hutcherson, whose importance in Everdeen's life is that they were essentially 'joint' victors in the last edition after having come to resist duelling to the death and therefore disobeying the State's wishes. But whatever - they live because the twist made for great TV. Central to the previous film was the notion of what constitutes entertainment, and what violence does to a society and a person when it is compartmentalised for amusement or pleasure. In 1998's 'Small Soldiers', a slimy business executive in charge of marketing action figure toys, whose sole purpose was to beat seven-shades out of one another, dodged the accusation that they were imparting the wrong ideas into the minds of the children that would play with them by pointing out that '...it's not violence, it's action.' In Snow's world, a population's interest in the hunger games resemble the hordes' interest in our own for the latest smash-'em-up blockbuster or war themed video game. When it seems evident Snow can utilise the friendship Peeta and Katniss have for one another to burnish his own status, he realises he can keep a population in check and quell a rebellion - not unlike how reality TV and soap operas make for both quaint distractions and politically charged opportunities to force the average joe into thinking there's something wrong with them if they don't agree with the mainstream.It's not that Peeta doesn't like Katniss - for someone living under the leaden skies of a North American dictatorship in relative poverty, she's not unattractive. He thinks she's 'stubborn', but 'good with a bow' - in her own opinion, she 'isn't very good at friends.' Very little of this actually matters by the end, though - the film isn't really a character study, it's an action film attempting allegory which is probably a little too long. Did any of these things change in Katniss by the end? Not really, and we are not granted satisfying closure anyway due to the need to tee up a third entry, which is handles clumsily.Before all that are the special 75h edition of the Hunger Games, which pits all the previous winners from other villages/divisions against one another in a great big battle royal set in an enclosed jungle space housing its own biodiversity; special power up 'drops' and a set of weaponry befitting to the skills of its competitors. The event is, in truth, an opportunity for the establishment to knock-off the troublesome lovebirds, who are doing more to foment unrest than sooth it, and replace them with a new 'couple' who will act as the great metaphor for the stability of the regime. For the film, it allows itself permission to cynically bring together proven battle hardened champions to face off with one another, essentially permitting more action and fighting than if the competitors were newbies with no clue as to what to do.This particular entry is not without merit, but it lacks something special for it to be anything more than what it is - a moderate actioner. Curiously, I did not feel for the characters involved in the same way that I did in the first film, and the actual 'games' themselves feel oddly synthetic, even incidental, where before they felt first like a brooding event and then then became a gruelling catharsis. The film handles the supposed tension between Snow's regime and the rest of the population quite well, without really presenting to us any of the large-scale uprisings that we're supposed to feel are endemic - this is achieved through Sutherland's acting more than anything, but you genuinely sense a political wrestling match is unfolding out there somewhere. When all is said and done, a dislike of the first film will probably lead to a positive hatred of this one. Enjoy the first, and you will gleam plenty from the continuation of the story here.",6,0,1,18 September 2018
Casino," Although it shouldn't take 2 hours and 51 minutes to tell a good story, Scorsese manages to draw us in.
","By 1995, Martin Scorsese had well and truly etched his name into the film making book and Casino is really just a cherry on the icing which was already on the cake; this means it's not a bad thing but just feels unnecessary. Whilst this film took me two sittings to get through (I had to cut it off with about 40 minutes remaining the first time I sat down to watch it), I can still see why it's gained a somewhat cult status amongst the masses.What's good about 'Casino' is its energy and vibrancy. The film is very colourful and attractive and it sucks the viewer into its world with several brilliant voice-overs that are informative and dark yet often funny. This is twinned with some brilliant use of colour giving us stone wall proof that cars don't just have to be metallic dark green or blue; jackets don't have to be grey Armani's or pinstripe suits  (they can be pale red!?) and that walls and buildings can be splashed with every colour of the rainbow and still look moderately average. Everybody has a favourite colour and so, when the viewer is drawn into the world giving the feeling you're actually there, sitting in the bars opposite the characters, walking and talking with the croupiers and gambling with the rest of them; it feels like there is something there for you  everyone, in fact and the colours act as a focal point as you map onto various items, objects, props and costume that bear your familiar favourite shade, making things easy on the gaze. This is how Casino's early attempt at drawing you in works.Although the film stays in the exact same gear for at least thirty minutes and the voice-overs (which you think will depart once the scene is set) remain, you can ignore it in a certain sense. There is that nagging sensation, however, that the whole opening is just a watered down back-story  explaining what happened in the first film, making 'Casino' actually feel like a sequel rather than a new, fresh film in itself.What's also odd is the fact that a lot of scenes just feel unnecessary. Pesci's character's dialogue scenes and twitchiness can only feel genuine and spookily evil for so many times and the results from his mounting relationship with a female character can be seen coming from quite a mile away. Although they feel out of place, the scenes are still entertaining enough  especially for the viewer who wants to see Pesci pile on his evil, bad-guy, 'wise-guy' caricature that he's been made famous for over the years. It's these things that bulk up the running time, frustratingly.What really grabbed the film by the scruff was the whole plot point that catapulted it into its final third. Without giving anything away, I'll mention one word: 'corruption' that involves (in some crazy way) absolutely everyone. And, as the final third reaches its, and the films, climax; there seem to be several twists and flips of the coin that involve characters floating here and then to there and then back again and then to where they were two stages ago..and so on. This was very annoying and was a disappointing, messy way to finish the film. It concludes, then re-opens and then concludes again before partly opening it back up before finally allowing the equilibrium to catch up with itself.Although brave, bold and energetic; 'Casino' ultimately felt like an excuse to pool together a couple of big name Hollywood actors, actresses and a director just to make another gangster film that everybody will probably love. If you want a film like this one but better, try Wayne Kramer's 2003 film 'The Cooler'. At least that's not as ridiculously long.",7,1,2,15 November 2006
Heat," One of the more necessary American crime films from recent years, as character as well as genre are given harsh redressings.
","The sorts of characters, and it is mostly low-lives, that inhabit Michael Mann's 1995 crime film opus are serial killers; thieves; ex-cons and gamblers, even those who aren't immediately applicable to those particular tags carry their own traits and flaws, one that'll see them get into hot water at some point in the piece. But to tell someone the film is possessed by these sorts of characters, however true it might be, would still be somewhat misleading as this is not the freak show of circus side-acts and dumbed down criminal caricatures one might initially think. Mann's film deals with some raw content from both sides of the law, content born out of various individuals' relationships with wives, partners and children; content born out of why it is what they do and how it can have as much-an affect on their private lives as it does their own lives.I read that it took Mann years to get the film made, doing what was perceived as a 'dumbed down' version via 1989's L.A. Takedown in the mean time. This was before Scorsese's Goodfellas arrived in 1990, a film that took the villain of the American crime film genre and fleshed him out to the point of skeletal in his being stripped bare, in doing so spawning a number of American crime films which enjoyed, within reason, deconstructing what were otherwise hard-bodied, villainous archetypes within a genre and getting under their skin in what they do, how they speak and how they operate. Nowadays people come away from such films remembering, indeed either relating to or liking more, the crime-infused villain more than anyone else, particularly if there is a 'just' co-lead. De Niro's character here joins a long list that sees mostly everyone from Liotta's Goodfellas character; to Jackon's in either Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown; to one of the two kidnappers in 1996's Fargo; right the way through to 2008 and Ledger's recent turn in The Dark Knight.But that isn't to say crime or a criminal lifestyle is glamorised in anyway, particularly in Heat. There is a beautifully observed sub-plot, nothing more than a mere diversion which has about five total minutes of screen time, utilising a character who has just got out of prison and is beginning a crummy job at a burger joint cleaning toilets and mopping floors. Later, they are given a proposition which will lure them back into the world of crime and violence. The point here, in this brief span of sub-narrative, being that everyday work is long and arduous, while you have an initial choice in which career you take - but a life of crime, no matter how appealing or alluring, will take its toll on your life. Although the use of an African-American to enforce this point in the film may have garnered some criticism in the past.The film centres around a 'crew' of thieves, in which the leader is seemingly Robert De Niro's Neil McCauley, as enforced when they stand around following the realisation that the police are onto them and each of them seem to look to McCauley for guidance: a blurry eyed Michael Cheritto (Sizemore) somewhat weakly exclaiming 'Whatever. I'm with you.' to McCauley when faced with a predicament that will either change his life or end it. The others are a gambling junkie named Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer) and a Mexican named Trejo, played by Danny Trejo. On the flip-side of the coin, Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna, a serial crew foiler, attempts to rid Los Angeles of McCauley's crew in taking them down. This is perhaps where the inspiration for the title of the 1989 version of the film derives; harking back to my earlier point, the title of this film: 'Heat' derives more from the criminally minded of the two sides, in particular McCauley's ideology of walking out on anything and everything if you smell the police (heat) closing in. This shifting of the title of the film from 'Takedown' (Police standpoint/goal) to 'Heat' (Criminal standpoint/ideology) only emphasises the post-Goodfellas idea of bringing everything round so that there's more of a weight on the fact the 'bad guys' are, at the end of the day, human as well. The film is polished, its mostly night-set cinematography decked out in navy blue, but its idea of a life in crime is quite ugly. The stark, harsh font used in the opening credits is metallic and uneasy on the eye; thus juxtaposing the 'look' of the film. It is a film that'll see the thief interact with a women in a loving manner, whilst at a book shop of all places, in a sequence that is soft and melancholy in its construction, before sleeping with her; but then cut to the police badgering and bullying a scrapyard employee. In another piece of work, the scenes would've stuck but the roles might've been reversed to enforce the inhumane and hard-bodied nature of the gangster and the good-hearted, kind, loving and melancholy nature of the chief cop.Heat essentially sees two individuals at the peak of their game go against one another, with whatever they have in the form of backup tailing them around. The fates of those on either side range from potential injury during full blown, breath-taking shoot outs with automatic weaponry in the streets of the city to more smaller things, such as a member of a SWAT team accidentally bumping into the side of a truck trailer, thus alerting the thieves to their presence. It's a film about crime, violence and procedure; but it is additionally concerned with genre archetypes as human beings, those whom feel; dream; realise flaws and balance marital issues. As far as attention to the intricacies of both character and plot go, as well as a number of other film-making conventions, Heat is a really creditable effort.",7,1,2,25 January 2010
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A New Hope inducing a new era, for good or for bad...
","Whatever it was George Lucas was shooting for with 'Star Wars: A New Hope', a rather audacious attempt at a rip-roaring multi-stranded action-adventure piece, it worked. In the years since its 1977 release, the film has become a phenomenon - spawning cartoons; toys; video games and an array of other offshoot memorabilia linked to the franchise. This first film of the series, like 'Citizen Kane'; 'Casablanca' or 'The Godfather', has since buried itself into an elusive canon which essentially sees it critic-proof - it is assumed that it is one of those films you have both seen and liked: if neither applies, then there must be something wrong with you...Viewing it more recently, and without, admittedly, really knowing an awful lot about it having never really seen the original trilogy, it is a difficult film to place into greatness, but it certainly packs the sort of punch for its genre that a film such as this should. Certainly, what Star Wars has on its side is time - the more garbage that is produced by Hollywood studios in contemporary times, the better these old Star Wars films seem to look: in a 1983 TV discussion with Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, critic John Simon dismisses Lucas' films as harmful childish nonsense. Meanwhile, modern film theorists lament the infantalisation of mainstream cinema; the dumbing-down of films, particularly sci-fi, which emphasise special effects too much. As far as having a place in history goes, Star Wars was really the unleashing of this particular genie, but it is far from mere stupidity.Lucas wastes no time in getting the show rolling - we are dropped, headfirst, into the middle of an intergalactic war between two sides which has been raging for some time. There is no time for set up in this regard; we don't know how things came to be as they are - the politics of the situation is sidestepped for crash-bash causality: we know that there are heroes, dressed predominantly in white, and villains, dressed predominantly in black; that the rebels are a broad spectrum of men, women, funky robots and large hairy creatures called wookies, whereas the members and soldiers of the Empire all look the same. The scale of the task in-front of the rebels is established in the opening shot, when its ship is dwarfed by the mammoth-sized one belonging to the other side that it is chasing it.On board is a feisty Princess by the name of Leia (Carrie Fisher), who might ordinarily be a male character - she has stolen, along with her crew, the plans for the film's universe's equivalent of an A-bomb, which allows their opponents (known only as 'the Empire') to annihilate an entire planet at the touch of a button. Within these plans lies of course its weakness, which will allow the rebels to destroy it. Chaos erupts when Leia's ship is boarded; a dithering robot by the name of C3PO confirms just how powerful a certain Darth Vader is within the Empire's ranks when he wonders if he will have him and his accomplice R2D2 sentenced to the salt mines. The plans are smuggled onto the database of the latter droid, both of whom are ejected down onto a barren planet so that one of Leia's allies may find them...From here, Lucas weaves a tale which is at once a little childish and, yes, simplistic, but does so through a series of worlds unlike few others and with an array of likeable supporting characters which possess a surprising amount of individuality. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is going nowhere on his uncle and aunt's ranch, harvesting crops and maintaining machinery - he longs for adventure and a shot at studying at 'the academy'. Eventually, he comes into contact with Obi-wan (Alec Guinness) when Skywalker accidentally purchases R2D2 - Obi-wan lives in solitude, depressed at the destruction of his race. This in turn leads the twosome to Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who attempts to pay off a debt to a slug-like gangster the film seems to think important by smuggling goods around the galaxy.What is refreshing is that these characters are essentially on the periphery of the war, only later to become more involved once they have matured through learning the lessons of allegiance and responsibility. 'A New Hope' does not revolve around muscular all-action heroes saving the day, which elevates it above some of what Hollywood would produce in the action genre in the 80's. Its triumph in this respect lies in its attention to detail; to background; to that which supports the central focus - we have seen the story before, while the film's climax, with its twists and epiphanies, is far from unpredictable.But it is the vastness of the mise-en-scene which pulls wool over our eyes, and we cannot help it - the invention of the concept of 'the force'; the diversity of the alien species hovering around, each with their own hideous features and characteristics; the varying worlds the characters can visit and the infinite possibilities that brings.At a time when thrills-and-spills filmmaking was largely confined to either the, often dingy, backstreets of the wrong part of town, or the disaster movie genre specifically, 'A New Hope' merged entertainment with a sense of the cinematic - soon after adding business to the equation - to revolutionise what a film studio might take-on when attempting to produce a new project. This has, of course, led to today's climate which is responsible for some complete rubbish - we have all skulked out of a multiplex having felt cheated of our time and money at the latest in sci-fi/action jiggery-pokery, and 'Star Wars' more broadly is to blame for the inception of the 'event' movie. In spite of this, I find it difficult to redirect these levels of frustration, even hatred, at 'A New Hope', which has an idea and a vision in mind and sprints for it - pulling it off in the process.",7,0,0,19 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Film that hasn't dated in terms of style and more remarkably; modernity. Still compelling when watched now.
","Some frown upon Star Wars, labelling it a fad and being equally unkind to that of its fans. Others praise Star Wars, living by it and its ideas that it garnished to do with 'The Force'. I never had any hostility towards Star Wars but I did toward the genre. Science Fiction has never been my favourite genre of film and likewise, blockbusters usually leave me underwhelmed and confused more often than not. The fact that Star Wars compelled me, kept me interested and above all entertained me then, is a fantastic achievement in itself.I just mentioned the word 'compelling' because that's exactly what the film is. Star Wars may be look upon as a 'fad.' or just one of those things where someone has come up with an idea that no one else has done before and then got rich off it through money and fans (Tarantino's Pulp Fiction may be a good recent example) but Star Wars is something more than that; it's a lesson in good and engaging story telling, interesting characters and fantastic settings. I remember seeing the recent prequels several months ago because they were available to me with the logic that if I watch Star Wars in chronological order, maybe I'll like the more critically bashed recent efforts more. Alas, Episode 1 was pretty good in my opinion but the second and third episodes stunk in terms of story telling, good characters and general interest. Seeing Star Wars now, I have come to really appreciate and acknowledge what this must've been when it first came out, what it must have been like to see something like this and be a part of it.It is clear Lucas had an idea in his head from the beginning which gives you an idea of the scope of his vision. There are numerous references to the previous episodes in the opening half an hour and it must've been both perplexing and fascinating for filmgoers to predict what it all meant at the time  I felt spoilt watching and knowing what it all meant with audiences from 1977 in mind not knowing at all - when was the last time I felt spoilt during a film? This is all part of Star Wars' effectiveness. Whilst I don't think Lucas has achieved auteur status, I feel that his accomplishment as a filmmaker is more that cemented. Lucas has come up with these various types of alien species; he's shown us brief glimpses of them throughout the film, leaving us wanting more; he's given us the special effects that we want to see more and more of and he's taken everything to do with modernity of the time and contaminated it on screen with robots, laserguns and the now famous space Katanas (lightsabres to most people).But the films scope doesn't stop there. It presents us with one of the best character introductions of all time: Han Solo (Ford), a guy sitting in the seediest of bars in the galaxy where shootings and dismemberment is a common thing, talking crime and money with equally seedy people before blowing one of them away when he learns of his death's price. Although remaining professional and giving us an entertaining scene, the film tells us everything we need to know about a character without use of voiceovers or flash-backs or even silly special effects as someone does something truly unbelievable in a dumb attempt to 'woo' an audience. Here, it's just feet up, cool banter, find out about the price on your head and 'Blam!'; job done. The film also achieves its cult status through use of futuristic scope. Man had landed on the moon a mere eight years ago and in the same vein as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars throws everything on screen to do with technology and yet remains undated: space, space crafts, lasers, robots; things that are around now and are at a much more advanced level and yet remain in Star Wars as fresh and entertaining as they ever did, have I mentioned 'compelling' yet? Lucas shows us he can deal with the more serious sides of story telling: a brief flirtation with a love story and the personification of evil through the 'dark side' and its similarities with the Nazis of the second world war. The way the guards dress inside the death star, the way storm troopers guard certain areas on certain planets, the use of an 'empire' in a film and the way the dogfights resemble Spitfire vs. Messerschmitt battles during the Battle of Britain. The film also knows how to keep us in suspense; there are some scenes when Skywalker (Hamill) and Solo are disguised as stormtroopers, where they face being crushed, where Skywalker has to make an important shot aboard his fighter plane, when a door is slowly opening behind them and certain death awaits  the editing and story telling make us involved and if you can zone yourself out enough, make it unpredictable; yes, unpredictable I said it.There is no reason not to identify the mediocre flaws the film has such as the may the dogfight at the end is edited in that dated sort of a way, nor can you ignore the fact any other Allied space ship being destroyed during the final fight is insignificant as we don't know who's in them and we don't care; I also didn't like the way the ships seemed to 'scream' past and the excessive beeping R2D2 kept making. These things aside, the film is still a 'blockbuster' and firmly cemented the legacy that summer films now have  next time you watch a blockbuster that's guaranteed to rake in cash thanks to your favourite stars and characters, spare a thought for little known Lucas and co. whose Star Wars wasn't expected to do well and yet took the time to entertain and remained smart at the same time.",7,1,2,2 November 2007
Deadpool," What, in the name of Canada, is this garbage?
","How does one know when a civilisation is doomed? When a film like 'Deadpool' makes 363 million dollars at the American box-office and 783 worldwide, that's when. The film is a wretched experience - the result of what might happen if a sixth former were to be given a couple of miles of film stock; all the money in the world and then told to go shoot something. It is a violent, unpleasant circus; a mess of postmodernism, a disturbing freakshow of special effects and the grotesque - I am staggered that there exist people in the world who do not think that the film is a badly judged, poorly made piece of repugnant exhibitionism which saps the soul and dulls the mind. Decades ago, a film like 'The Mask' demonstrated that you don't have to be rude to be funny; now, 'Deadpool' informs us that you can be almost totally irredeemable but cool.Indeed, not since 'The Mask' have I seen a lead physically interact with the fabrics of a cinematic universe as intently as Deadpool does here. At various points in the film, in no particular order, the lead will do all of the following: fast-forward the movie; insult other off-screen superheroes; break the fourth-wall within a fourth-wall breaking flashback; stick chewing gum to the camera and then later actually pan the camera away using his hand so that we may not gaze upon an especially violent moment.We all smirked when we first saw 'Pulp Fiction' and heard a character literally re-tune the radio over the opening credits, but very little of any of this is as clever as it thinks. Nor is it especially ground-breaking - films as diverse as 'Man Bites Dog' and 'Breathless' had been experimenting with these sorts of tropes years earlier, while the putting of it to a series of sword-violence just reminded me of 'Kill-Bill'. 'Man Bites Dog' (to which 'Deadpool' probably owes the greatest debt), for instance, even includes a scene whereby the Deadpool-style psychopath the camera crew follow around quite literally edits a scene of the movie himself, so insinuating that it is he who is putting the whole project together.'Deadpool' is about an ex-special forces soldier-turned-street punk named Wade Wilson, who is portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. Wilson mooches around collecting debts and sorting out problems amongst the scum of the city - in his own words, he is a bad guy whose job it is to mess with even worse guys. His best friend Weasel (T.J. Miller), who owns a local tavern, and his girlfriend is sex-worker Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). This was all before he suddenly contracted cancer and had to undergo treatment; something he did so through an organisation headed up by a shady, suited individual who looks conspicuously like Max Keiser. But the organisation was not quite what was advertised, and following complications which disfigure him, he becomes the character of Deadpool: a red tracksuit sporting super-freak extremely well-versed in katana blades and with little else on his mind but revenge.And that is, broadly speaking, the end of it - the set-up is an excuse for a series of scenes depicting little more than bloody carnage, each as spectacularly dull as the last: what is the point in verbally mocking superhero films and the action genre if you're just going to fall into being a mindless one yourself? As a lead, Deadpool is an incredibly simplistic character - doing under his new identity more or less what he did under his old one, only on a bigger and bloodier scale. Nothing really characterises him - he shares no duality with a villain as there is no real villain, merely a fellow punk who worked at the medical facility with whom he had a few cross-words. The character, made invulnerable during the treatment, results in there being no suspense to any of the set-pieces. What are we thus even watching? Is there a statement being made, about violence in popular culture, or otherwise? Was there a remark in there on America's healthcare system that I missed?Sad though it is to say, films such as 'Deadpool' are where mainstream American cinema finds itself: big, brash and bombastic but with nothing actually to it. The film left me feeling empty; I was sad when it ended, but sad for civilisation and cinema - sad that there were people out there who genuinely thought the contents of this piece were what people wanted to see and might make for a substantial film-going experience. Is there a better example of a film which might act as the epitome of our society's slow, inevitable culture-death than Tim Miller's 2016 effort here? Today's age, characterised by fatuity and crudity, is perfectly positioned to produce the miserable experience that-is 'Deadpool'. That it garners such awesome praise, and makes such vast amounts of money, is surely the signal that what we were warned about all those years ago has finally come to pass.",4,2,2,6 May 2019
300," Not so much an historical epic as one long, flashy fight scene with just everything thrown into the mix.
","300 is a film that is so full of so many things that it burns the eyes to watch it and burns the mind to recall them all. The film is an adaptation of a graphic novel that depicted a true event and is also a remake of a 1960s film about the same thing; this is enough evidence from the outset to suggest 300 is going to borrow, recycle, update and generally make a nuisance of everything we think we know about the subject.The film plays out, in the long run, like a multi-million dollar financed Rugby match between two sides that are allowed to include swords, shields, arrows, spears and.........elephants. The opposition are even allowed to call upon some help from some seemingly un-dead friends to aid the cause, perhaps ideas for monsters that were rejected from director Zach Snyder's first film Dawn of the Dead at risk of it becoming too much like Resident Evil and not enough like its 1978 original. The reason I say 300 burns the eyes and the mind is that it puts so much on screen in the form of actual content and visuals but also makes room for undertones, undercurrents and thus creates a massive boiling pot of genre fusion, computer generated imagery and enough cinematography to get even the most harshest of CGI critics raising an eyebrow in either awe or appreciation.I don't think 300 is a film you watch for its plot. There have been many historical epics over the last few years depicting true events from centuries gone by such as Braveheart, Apocalypto and Gladiator and all of them have at their core, a story which is either heart whelming or engaging to the audience; in 300, the things we engage with the most are the battle scenes and amazing visuals we are treated to. The film tries to get us to focus on the king, his queen and their love for one another but we don't really care much about that, likewise the film tries to open up a little twist about twenty minutes to the end regarding a rouge in the kingdom and his accusations of the queen's faith or whatever but again, we don't care. Unlike the three examples I gave; 300 plays around with the setting of the film, it toys with the 'look' every film has thus contains issues of spectatorship and plagiarises (sorry, 'references') Henry V in its closing monologue and Gladiator with its shots of fields and heather, again at the end.What sticks out in 300 doesn't make it a bad film more so a funny one without actually meaning to be which to some, is bad. The scene in which the 300 Spartans are lining up before any of the battle scenes and are being inspected by King Leonidas (Butler) contains strong undertones of homosexuality as captains and troops 'look' at one another; raising eyebrows and faintly smiling. There is also the issue that even when they are at home, in their village, the males still walk around bare-chested with their muscles bulging in an attempt to perhaps come across 'better equipped' than anyone else. This sort of content is the exact opposite to Laura Mulvey's argument that women are the object of the gaze since the females in this film are pretty well clothed in comparison. I also couldn't help but notice all the constant references to sadomasochistic clothing. At some point in the film; people are seen wearing leather straps around them, a group of servants are whipped, another group of servants have to kneel down as Xerxes (Santoro) walks all over them and uses them as steps; Xerxes himself is covered in chains and piercings and an entire wave of enemy troops are actually wearing masks during the battle (surely they would've struck more fear into the Spartans had they been barefaced). Like I said, this doesn't make 300 a bad film so much as it does make it interesting to read into.Despite its suspension of reality in the form of mostly mutants and not humans being the bad guys, the fight scenes are still impressive and remain whatever anyone says the reason you're going to watch the film. The inclusion of dinosaurs and ninjas begs the question when the film was set but in my opinion, you can suspend belief if you figure it's set in an alternate reality of some sort although elements of science fiction was the last thing I expected to be in 300. However whatever I did expect to be there was there and it was good for what it was.",7,0,0,20 October 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," I'm not convinced this is as good as it THINKS it is, but there is enough to admire to give it a go.
","You come away from 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' a little breathless, but more-so down to its bounding energy and sheer brashness than because you feel you have just seen a great film. For sure, the film is a colourful, kinetic experience; a series of brutal body blows which pulls you left; right and centre - across genres and through homages, but that did not stop me from feeling pleased that it was all over when it was. In spite of whatever 'Kingsman' does well - the good choreography; the want to see the characters make it through their odds; the amusing villain - there is an annoying feeling of puerility to the film, or of immaturity. When Matthew Vaughn released 'Kick-Ass' in 2010, the cover of a popular British film magazine depicted one of the characters in full superhero garb and the headline 'Say Hello to Your New Favourite Film', and there is that same aggravating, even adolescent, sense with 'Kingsman'. It is difficult to put into words, but I am sure you know what I mean - the film is far from being your typical brain-dead blockbuster, and one cannot fault its ambition, but it lacks a certain nuance or sense of subtlety. The film tells the double-stranded tale of a young London lad getting out of one world and into another alongside a suave veteran of espionage who senses his time is coming to an end as comrades die around him and world threats seem to intensify. Colin Firth plays said veteran: a secret agent by the name of Harry Hart, who operates as Galahad in an all-action British governmental group running in covert operations - try to imagine James Bond's 'Double O' section on steroids. Parallel to him is the story of Taron Egerton's character Gary, colloquially referred to as 'Eggsy', whose father was part of the same eponymous secret service group Galahad is in until he was killed in action some twenty years ago. Raised fatherless, both he and his mother have since fallen on harder times and Gary, now in his early twenties, finds himself occupying a flat in a seedy part of London whilst periodically falling out with his mother's sociopathic new boyfriend and dodging potentially fatal gang warfare. Gary and Galahad's worlds collide when the latter loses yet another agent during a mission in snowy Argentina, wherein a scientist specialising in global warming has been kidnapped and a rescue attempt is botched. Galahad's boss, played by Michael Caine, is losing patience: this particular agent, discovered and groomed by Galahad himself, did not live up to expectations. Gary, meanwhile, is living on even less borrowed time and comes into contact with Firth's character through some relatively convoluted means in order to begin, in true 'Men in Black' style, his inception into the universe of this elite secret agency.Providing energy to the piece is Samuel L. Jackson's wonderful villain Richmond Valentine; a politician hating eco-terrorist with a speech impediment who has made his name operating in the technology industry and flinches at the sight of blood. He has his henchwoman, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), take care of the more murderous side of being a super villain - think a more nubile version of Richard Kiel's Jaws character, but with legs and feet replacing teeth... We have seen films like 'Kingsman' before, and we have previously enjoyed narratives similar to what is depicted therein, but Vaughn is canny enough to construct the experience in such a way that has us feel like this is our first time. The film is not manipulative in this respect, but it is brash. As was the case with 'Kick-Ass', it takes absolutely no interest in whether or not it is offending you or even wearing you down - like it or not, this is the route it's taking. Through whatever means, the film manages to balance both revisionism and convention into a congealed, post-modernist package. The way the film eventually comes to fuse the execution of a dastardly plan Valentine is hatching; Gary undergoing his training and the Kingsman agency uncovering a series of strange occurrences around the world of army militias conspicuously turning on themselves is satisfying. Midway through, Vaughn plummets us headfirst into a steadycam sequence of one of these militias fighting one another in what is a quite striking scene outlining in equal measure both precisely what is at stake should our heroes fail and that the makers of the film have an eye for raw flair and constructive carnage. Despite being an incredibly striking film, this sequence to one side, I am unsure as to whether 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' amounts to much more than a well-made actioner with a familiar tale of a farmhand leaving behind his domestic set-up for world-saving greatness. It deals, mostly, in stereotypes: the fascist American southerners; the suave Westminster Londoner; the Scandinavian blonde and the Millwall Football Club yobs. Meanwhile, you get the feeling there was meant to be a message embedded in the film somewhere to do with the danger of phone/tablet technology, and what it is turning people into, but it gets a little lost. Irrespective, there is enough in 'Kingsman' to recommend it - it executes what it wants to do with a certain unbridled brazenness and does what it wants with a level of enthusiasm where many other action films too often feel like they are going through the motions. This is not the case here.",6,1,1,4 April 2018
Tarzan," Healthy Disney entry that struggles in its representation and narrative but holds up with music and animation.
","I do not think this film lacks the Disney 'spark', nor do I think it lacks the Disney 'magic' that so many of their films carry and that makes them so enjoyable. If anything, this Disney effort doesn't have any magic at all but that is only from a subjective point of view regarding the film's content itself. Whereas past protagonists have had magic lamps, have magically been given legs and have suffered magical epiphanies that makes them wan to go back and fight for what is rightfully theirs; Tarzan, as a film, is more down to Earth and on this level is more of a 'realistic' Disney film.This is not the first Disney film to deal with colonialism of some sort. 1995's Pocahontas had similar themes of outsiders visiting a rural utopia in which morals and understandings were happily being lived out. Like Tarzan, Pocahontas was a very 'real' film what with it being set in this world but its boundaries were blurred a little when that willow tree started talking to the characters. In this case, the outsiders visiting the rural world are initially only very few with the rest of the crew and the 'Governor Ratcliffe' character not yet apart of proceedings although Clayton (Blessed) looks suspiciously like the 1995 film's antagonist. One of the other two characters initially part of the set up is Jane (Driver) who, in a reverse of Pocahontas' set up, is a female visiting a male 'savage' rather than the other way around. Finally, as a villain, Clayton embodies all the necessary psychical traits of Ratcliffe as well as the dreams of a bigger and better life for him back home (at the expense of the new found riches, of course)So this film has a lot in common with Pocahontas in that sense but is it that good? Is it perhaps better than Pocahontas? My opinion is 'no, it is not' but it does come strikingly close to being better. Like I said, this does not lack Disney magic and Disney spark but that does not mean it contains enough anyway. From a storytelling point of view, Tarzan is pretty poor but so was 1992's Aladdin  only thing there was that it had the Genie character to keep laughs and entertainment flowing thick and fast; there is no loud and magical 'kick' to this, just a simple 'girl-meets-boy' premise and a sad back-story regarding the hero's parents. But that's the way it goes in terms of storytelling. On the whole, I was impressed. It is clear that the producers saw George of the Jungle from two years previous and were impressed by Brendan Fraser's performance of George; in terms of look and physique than actual acting because Tarzan in the film looks strikingly like him. There is also the way the film toys with the character of Tarzan, giving him the human instincts that he should possess and hinting at his soon to be obvious journey of self-discovery. During the course of the opening, Tarzan will invent the knife and he will upgrade it to a spear when he attaches a stick to it thus leaving behind the 'gorilla' method of merely climbing and reaching for fruit during a food gathering montage instead of using initiative and inventing something to tackle the situation. Tarzan will also use his man advantages to defeat a threat to the clan further emphasising his superiority over the strongest gorilla, Kerchak (Henriksen).But the film suffers from not only those things that hold back a Disney film when it comes to issues of equality, but also things of a film making nature. Firstly, the film has a problem with the space in which the characters inhabit, frequently ignoring logic and substituting it for laughs  since the film does not have a 'genie' or a set of cutlery or a 'Timon and Pumbaa' to get across the laughs that kids and some adults will enjoy, it needs to have Tarzan and Jane surfing down tree trunks; flying uncontrollably through the air and landing ridiculously safely as well as a bizarre and somewhat out of place chase involving a hoard of baboons. Not only this but Disney's now obligatory issues of representation creep in; I may have let them slide previously but when I am apart of the targeted group, I take offence. The English sailors are perceived as conniving and are somewhat evil  there are 'good' sailors but they are never presented and do not have a lot of screen time. Furthermore, Jane and her father come across as rather inept and innocent in their bumbling and comic antics. This is also the reason Tarzan's blood parents do not speak because they too are 'good' English characters.Then there are the other characters. The gorillas and Tarzan himself are all American with Tarzan's best friend Terk bizarrely adopting a Brooklyn accent; Tarzan's mother and Kerchak are also American and are put across as good people  no coincidence that the American gorillas all have morals and established ways of living before the interfering Europeans arrive with their big ideas. But if you delve deep enough into the Earth, you will destroy it as you will reach the core  Tarzan is still enjoyable and Phil Collins presents a great soundtrack. The premise may be cute and the execution equally so, but this is not a strong effort as the weak and anticlimactic final third would confirm.",6,0,0,23 March 2008
The Hangover Part III," Less of a headache than the other Hangovers, but a long way from anything special.
","Contrary, seemingly, to everybody else, I didn't care much for the first two 'Hangover' films - the sheer volume and all the charging around had them feel like more was going on than actually was... It was to my tremendous surprise, then, that I took to the third film of the trilogy, which is certainly enjoyable if you try to put the first two films out of your mind and enjoy it for the rather daft causality driven thriller that it is. If you gave it a tweak here and there; kept the overarching plot devices and other content, 'The Hangover: Part 3' becomes a little like an Elmore Leonard story or one of Westlake's 'Dortmunder' novels - luckless characters on the wrong side of some even worse people depicted as trying to get out of the jackpot whilst having a hard time obeying the law.The film, unlike the other two, chooses not to revolve the story around the aftermath of a night of drinking - the characters here are not relegated to attempting to piece together the remnants of a botched boozy fiesta from behind the veneer of a seemingly incoherent set of clues. Rather, the film grants them sobriety and lucidity: they know exactly what the score is and are otherwise in a state of able-mindedness to go about fixing it. The 'Wolfpack' remains unchanged: Bradley Cooper; Ed Helms; Justin Bartha and Zach Galifianakis are back playing Phil, Stu, Doug and Alan, respectively. In sticking to tradition (sort of), they lose Doug and even, for a brief few scenes, reacquire a familiar face played by Mike Epps. The reason for Doug's disappearance this time is the very real and very dangerous threat of a gangster named Marshall, who puts the wind up our established foursome and is played by John Goodman with satisfying gusto. For reasons not otherwise entirely convoluted, events dating right back to the first film linked to an off-screen a drug deal one of the Wolfpack was inadvertently involved in have caught up with them, and they must find the irresistible force of international man of mystery Lesley Chow (Ken Jeong) in order to put things right. Much of this is a cue for mayhem, particularly when Chow himself tricks the gang into stealing something for him which they really ought not have done, but mayhem which just seems to be under a tighter rein that before. Perhaps it is because I am too often a sucker for films such as 'City of Industry' when they come along that I enjoyed this Part Three, which essentially depicts (sort of) the aftermath of a heist and those on the wrong end of a betrayal during said heist who then strive to get their 'share' back. Broadly speaking, American critic Christy Lemire is right when she writes that the film '...runs a different sort of risk by going to places (different) than its predecessors, both artistically and emotionally. It dares to alienate the very audience that made 'The Hangover' the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time.' In a move which should, for all intents and purposes, have made me dislike it even more than the first two, the film combines the elements of its predecessors: the espionage and action-orientated fluff of the second, which is interwoven, partly, with the locale and the players of the first. The tone seems more grown up - there is more at stake; none of our characters is having fun in this particular adventure. Gone is that sense of it being a bit of a romp or a bit of a laugh, and it stays on a track that stops it from veering off into the nightmarish territory of the second. In a crucial moment which represents, more broadly, the maturing of the series, the film dares to have its characters express both disgust and exasperation when their misadventure forces them to roll back into Las Vegas to find what they're looking for. The film is far from anything fantastic; it is no tremendous experience, neither moving nor affecting. It possesses little-to-no especially attentive character study beyond the crew's lamenting of being forced into confronting old hunting grounds and crossing paths with old enemies: Galifianakis' character opens the film with a sequence you will not have previously witnessed involving a sports car and a giraffe - from here, his day gets worse when he suffers a bereavement at home and then faces being carted off to a psychiatric institution. In terms of individual film characters having a bad day, rarely does it get much worse. But where does any of it go? By the end, he is still a liability. Has he changed? We can't say, as the film terminates just as a new chapter in his life opens up. If there is never again another 'Hangover' film, it would not bother me in the slightest, although, to my minute shame, I did enjoy this one.",6,0,0,11 September 2018
The Thin Red Line," Explores that fine line between a beautiful and an ugly place as characters attempt to find themselves amidst it all.
","The Thin Red Line is a wonderfully observed, slow-burning film chronicling the madness of war and the effects it has on those involved. Told from a couple of characters' own points of view via narration, the film documents events in the Pacific during World War Two and is a triumph of capturing thoughts, feelings and emotions felt from the first person perspective. As a war film, it is the anti-thesis to something like Pearl Harbor or a Rambo sequel, as exploring sensations, feeling emotions and the opening up of one's mind is the order of the day. Whilst combining beautifully captured imagery, but never quite coming across as a piece that glorifies warfare or make war as a whole 'beautiful' per se; The Thin Red Line is a marvellous achievement in straight, un-perturbed and anti-formula film-making working within a distinct genre.It's the film's poster that best captures what you're heading in for when it comes to The Thin Red Line. Three separate soldiers, ducked down amidst the reeds, either cowering; planning or maybe just observing. The item that springs to mind, or indeed captures our gaze, are the three separate eyes of these men – not the helmets dictating to us the obviousness of the genre; not the brightly coloured foliage designed to distract us by informing us of how strenuously low down these guys are; not even the impressive cast list to the left can alter our gaze. It is the eyes that are looking off centre, eyes that are capturing whatever they're looking at with a small matter of fear, surprise, anguish and acceptance. Each of the soldier's helmets block out one of the other soldier's eyes, rendering the picture somewhat uncanny, but it goes some way in telling us it is a film all about looking; observing and gazing at what's presented to you.The film predominantly centres around three men, men who are Private Witt (Caviezel); Private Bell (Chaplin) and a Colonel by the name of Tall (Nolte) – soldiers in C Company based around the area of Guadalcanal, during the Japanese occupation of that fateful time. The film opens in the most un-war-like of fashions; with a voice-over accompanied montage of all things beautiful as Witt mingles with some Pacific region natives on an island set away from the war and away from the fighting. This is not a plunging us into the forefront of battle alá Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now with some beach landings or a Napalm bombing and this is not a throwing us into the harsh, behind-the-scenes reality of something put across in the opening of Platoon. For better or for worse, this is an opening set away from not only firefights and bombing raids but the war and the warfare area itself. Although interestingly, like some of the above examples; it accompanies its imagery with some soft, instrumental and somewhat classical music.The essence of Malick's film being one of the patient variety is captured in the film's attitude to war as an individual item. Rather than open with acts of warfare as explored in the previous paragraph, the director here implants a dizzying array of aspects of mise-en-scene onto the screen that foreshadow violence and blood-shed without ever giving us any. Large, towering cannon-like artillery guns line the decks of the warship we spend much of the early exchanges on; there's a huge, nervous build-up to some beach landings which double up as the film's first example of military action of some kind, whereas each and every solider carries with him a rifle making the presence of firearms extremely prominent. These things, along with the given fact the beach landings are quiet and un-countered by the Japanese, are examples of the film showing us the implements and actions of war without ever actually giving us war itself. Indeed, Malick presents us the results of any fighting before we see any fighting when the bloody bodies of two dead soldiers are encountered.But that's not to say there are no scenes of fighting at all. The beauty of the location, and the manner in which the camera makes us well aware it is in love with the place in the opening few shots of the film, is purposefully grossly juxtaposed with the notion of long, bloody warfare within the jungle. The first instance of fighting is painful, rather arduous and for not very much as American forces struggle to get an entirely firm grip on a hill dominated by enemy machine gun and mortar placements. There are a number of things that are to The Thin Red Line's great credit; firstly, the fact the film manages to sustain a distinct level of intensity following these Guadacanal landings, and the instances of one's mental and physical endurance being pushed. Secondly, the film's multi-equilibrium approach of detailing a central character's decline in marital status is handled well enough that it doesn't detract from the ongoing pain and suffering of the war as a whole unfolding around him and everyone else. The film is of the slow burning, but ultimately rewarding variety - Malick takes each step as it comes; dealing with fear, desperation, desertion and the lust for glory in an observed and timely fashion, the likes of which we should relish given the current rarity of films of this ilk.",8,3,6,11 November 2009
Fantastic Four," Sorry excuse for an action film and not much better as a comic book adaptation either.
","Fantastic Four is a film that astounds and surprises but maybe not necessarily for the right reasons; it's a film that will have you laughing at it rather than with it for most of the time with its ludicrous situations and ideas that it so desperately wants you to believe; and yet it remains a solid if not unspectacular entry into the recent spate of comic book adaptations even if it does play out like a B-movie 90% of the time.It seems ironic that the director is called Tim Story because he clearly doesn't have one to work with here since at its core, Fantastic Four is a film without one. In one half of this bi-linear film, you have Reed Richards (Gruffudd); Sue Storm (Alba); Johnny Storm (Evans) and Ben Grimm (Chiklis) all moping around trying to come to terms with their new powers and for Grimm, his new image. The other half consists of Victor von Doom (McMahon) getting a thirst for blood as he wipes out the board members that sacked him from his own company. It seems strange that Spider-Man from three years previous managed to show us Peter Parker's reaction to his new found powers in a fun and somewhat entertaining montage in about five minutes; here it takes up almost half the film. But there is plenty more wrong with Fantastic Four. If you can get over the fact that the 'bad guy' is called 'von Doom' and manage to refrain yourself from chuckling whenever his hilariously camp villain is on screen, you'll surely not be able to look past the way all the characters seem to whisper their lines for the first forty minutes; the way the film would then blast us with juvenile rock music whenever it felt like and the way Johnny Storm has the mental capacity of a sixteen year old yet is apparently smart enough to be an astronaut, despite not knowing what the temperature of the sun is.Yes, Fantastic Four is a film that is on par with The Core in terms of not only scientific screw ups but terrible characterisation. I find it amazing that shortly after the space storm, or whatever it was, gives them the powers; they spend some time in quarantine and yet nobody there is able to register they have abnormal DNA inside them; nobody ever grabs one of the four and shakes them by the shoulders exclaiming: 'Shut up and listen; you're different' but the one thing that really takes the cake is the fact von Doom apparently doesn't even need to be in quarantine since we see him out and about whilst everyone else is at hospital. As a villain, von Doom is very weak with his victims being very obvious in obligatory scenes you just groan at: the doctor that wants to tell everyone; the board member in the car park and our heroes as a whole: his antagonism and sense of threat is either anti-climatic, needless or pointless.As characters, our heroes that are the Fantastic Four are equally anti-climatic or needless. None of them are developed beyond any form of what they are at the very beginning bar Ben Grimm (aka The Thing). Grimm's fiancé it would seem, ditches Ben telling us she truly does go for what's on the outside and not inside. Grimm is also the strongest of the four and has the worst reaction to the accident: both physically and psychologically as he contemplates suicide on a bridge. He even finds time to tempt himself into falling in love again. It is here that I suggest the film should have been made with Grimm as the lone character. The film does not need Johnny Storm what-so-ever; it does not need Sue Storm either except for maybe getting some male teenage audiences in and the only reason for Richards' inclusion is so that someone has the level of intelligence to try and build a machine that'll reverse the effects but that is a sub-plot that is weak, underdeveloped and actually rather pointless. Take out Richards, give Grimm his intelligence and then you might have a good film.But then we wouldn't be able to gush at Johnny's fire effect or the way he treats women like trash; we wouldn't be able to see him do his insane bike stunts to loud rock music. Johnny actually soaks up the media attention the film has within it but previous comic book efforts have society dislike their heroes at the beginning: Batman and Spider-Man are good examples with X-Men 2 using it as an entire narrative drive. Fantastic Four is a film that would have all its women in its universe blindingly attractive; I highly doubt girls as pretty as Jessica Alba would go on dates to an observatory with their boyfriends and that the nurse at the beginning would be as dumb and as attractive as she was, simultaneously. Fantastic Four is also a film that thrives on its product placement: one such tilt shot starts on 'ESPN' and then moves down to the action. Burger King's 'flamed to perfection' also cashes in  I guess a $100,000,000 budget wasn't enough for Mr. Story and co..So with cartoon characters that are as badly written as cartoon characters in a three picture skit; a story that revolves around pretty much nothing for three quarters of the time and a film that is relatively action starved, the film is a failure. The only reprieve Fantastic Four might have is that its villain is defeated in its finale through good use of science rather than aggression but that is clutching at some extremely thin straws.",5,1,2,2 January 2008
The Great Escape," Sporadic but oddly intriguing film set amidst an Allied prisoner of war camp; an unnerving but effective meshing of the horrors of war with rabid, punchy entertainment.
","For the most part, The Great Escape is a romping and rather enjoyable Second World War film about working together; being brave; overcoming a predicament and escaping. If it means thwarting the Nazis in the process then so be it. It plays out under a banner of surprisingly upbeat, somewhat comical, borderline happy-go-lucky entertainment – it seems most of the characters held within the prisoner of war camp, which we spend most of the film's runtime within, are quite enjoying trying to escape; frustrating the Nazi officials; repeatedly risking their lives and, oddest of all, spending time in a small concrete six by four hole which is named 'The Cooler'. War films demand conflict, and they usually demand a certain sense of action spectacle which, handled, correctly doubles up as the film's bloody and unappealing warfare; The Great Escape appears to want to have it every other which way. Here is a war film that has so much fun for its first hour and a half that when the time comes for its character to bolt for the blue, it isn't sure how to deal with some of their expeditions into the wider unknown and flits uncontrollably from ups to downs, morphing its atmosphere rather uncontrollably from terror to tragedy to excitement to relief and then back again.We begin with a procession of trucks and vehicles transporting Allied prisoners to an isolated camp in rural Germany during World War 2. Over the credits they travel, journeying deeper and deeper into the forests; across the roads and over the hills until that sense of being deep into the middle of absolutely nowhere is effectively established. The measure of how far the prisoners whom we focus on go, from arriving at the camp to doing what they do, is effectively established when they step out of the trucks upon arrival: they're bleary eyed rabble of a bunch, a little lost in their new surroundings and not entirely together yet 'as one'. The following scene sees a British officer speak to the camp's leader; the German towering over him as he stands instead of sitting and lays out the rules, the officer's leg based injury a further establishment of the superiority he has in comparison. The dialogue shot in profile so as to get across the degrees of conflict between them but then somewhat such a composition relinquished when middle ground is reached and immediate conflict dissipates through agreement, even if it is retained in essence.The camp itself is the Germans placing of all those whom are guilty of repeated escape attempts from other camps into one big camp that they believe is capable of holding all of them. Once out, it's always inferred neutral Switzerland is the place to head toward; the powers that be seemingly counteracting this by having the camp far away enough that a fighter plane voyage won't get you across the border. So as to engulf the widest possible audience for the film, we come to revolve around an array of men from an array of backgrounds of an array of different nationalities. An amusing scene early on highlights the clashing of these cultures, backgrounds and attitudes; an American more broadly representative of most of the film's Americans speaks to a British character, again posing as a broader representation of people of his nationality, about how hunting and shooting birds rather than sketching them and that riding motorcycles instead of your more bog-standard, boring even, bicycles is more preferable in either case.Of the film's Americans, Steve McQueen's captain named Virgil Hilts is a man continuously pushing the boundaries of what the Germans might tolerate, a young rebellious sort whom later adopts the mantle of the film's lead action man. Regarding the British, Richard Attenborough's Roger Bartlett is granted a separate arrival to that of everybody else complete with S.S. escort, his expertise in escaping from camps built up through other's dialogue whilst he's off screen whereas Donald Pleasence's Flight lieutenant named Colin Blythe, a man who's a dab hand at forging whatever need forging in what is itself a skill which requires precision and patience, is a more heartwarming presence as he himself undergoes his own subplots to do with health and friendships with another inmate. With an array of supporting acts, none of whom in the form of Scottish; Polish or Australian prisoners match up to the strength in ability and smarts as the English or Americans, the Pole of whom later needs his hand practically held so as to get through the tough stuff to freedom, the film uses the premise to tell a true story in a relatively interesting manner of how several men broke out of a POW fortress.The film is a fairly engaging piece for the best part, its stuff to do with character done and dusted by the time the planning and executing of several escape attempts plays out; Hilts' early attempt to just go for it thwarted with ease establishing a sense that time and due care is almost certainly required. The film isn't concerned as much about plot as it is with telling a tale of how something happened, in a somewhat precise manner which has the film all too annoyingly resemble that of a montage in doing one thing; planning the next stage and fulfilling that bit – sometimes it works, others it doesn't and they have to take a step backwards. On occasion, the flag waving in that the Americans bail the Brits out on occasion is tiresome; James Garner's Lieutenant Hendley aiding Blythe at the risk of his own expense as well as Hilt's sacrifices early on so as to aid Bartlett in their tunnel digging a tad odd. Regardless, director John Sturges keeps the film moving; and while the 172 minutes do fly past fairly quickly whilst we're stuck in this prison, that fact is more of an achievement than the film is as a whole actually is.",6,0,2,23 November 2010
Click," Ill advised amalgamation of philosophy with playground humour aimed at those too young to know of basic life lessons.
","If there's one thing that's a little tough to sit through, then it's an Adam Sandler film in which the majority of the comedy is born out of daft, moronic, frat-boy humour linked to bodily functions; but if there's something that's, arguably, a little tougher to sit through, then it's an Adam Sandler film in which the majority of the comedy is born out of daft, moronic, frat-boy humour linked to bodily functions which doubles up as a life lecture. Many have been fooled, it would seem; many have fallen to the spell of Frank Coraci, the directorial Svengali for Click, the American film from 2006 which panders to two sorts of crowds but cons nobody with any sort of real sense. On the surface, an important 'message movie' about life and how to deal with life and that you should find time for those you love and find time to be patient for those you don't but at the core, a hate-filled; sexist and racist piece that aims pretty low and hits there or there-abouts.Sandler is indeed the lead in Click, an architect named Michael Newman who spends his days wallowing in his basement attempting to work on a particular project which will see him garner a sort of 'mother' of all promotions. He has a family that includes kids whom appear to be interested in a variety of different things; a wife with whom there is a definite connection; a dwelling that is one of 'those' gorgeous, American neighbourhoods and generally seems to be doing pretty well for himself. Despite all this, our Michael is wavering into some sort of depressive state, stating that he really wouldn't mind if his life got a little shorter. One day, sick with all the remote controls in and around the house, systematically getting across a sense of real inability to deal with modernity and those little things that try to make your life a tiny bit easier, he journeys to the local mall in order to find a universal remote; something that can control everything at once. Upon arriving, he meets eccentric technician Morty (Christpher Walken channelling a familiar sort of mad professor act) who gives him a remote that it's eventually revealed can control a lot more than just household electronics.It's a simple enough premise, and it's delivered with a simple enough aplomb in the early stages as sequences that exist purely to fill up the trailers and TV spots are played out to do with colour saturation; volume; freeze framing and language control. You might be forgiven for thinking that Michael didn't, at some point, merely direct the remote up into the air and push 'channel up', thus shifting everything into an alternate universe-come-network-come-broadcast; the reason for this being that the people inhabiting the universe of Click are odd, strange, scary individuals and all of whose problems are exploited for cheap laughs. Examples of these people arrive in the form of Michael's infantilised secretary persistently asking whether she can take toilet breaks; his parents appearing somewhat verbally abusive; his boss, a certain Mr. Ammer (Hasselhoff), a disgusting concoction of nymphomania blended with resentment and Michael himself carries an odd, sadistic streak in which the infliction of pain on others is a release.Click sets its stall out pretty early on when it resorts to dog-humping jokes and, for sake of similar laughs, brings on an eight year old boy and has him say a few dirty words. It's mostly unforgivable and unfolds within a world in which most of the women are jaw-droppingly stunning, as well as Arabic businessmen from the Far East whom exist to be mocked, imitated and have their names pronounced incorrectly for easy laughs. It is very much the sort of film attempting to deal with very real and somewhat necessary ideas under this banner of adolescent, 'kick-back and enjoy', narrow-minded entertainment. When Michael shouts at Morty, upon hearing the universal remote is free of charge, 'why (he would) want to return something (that was) free of charge', you half expect a little green light to appear in the top corner of the screen exclaiming, for the benefit of those not paying attention, that the film's hypothesis has appeared and everything after this will be a test of the preceding statement.The message, screaming at the audience loud and clear; a drumming into the audience's heads on what's right and what's not, is that one needs to appreciate the finer things in life and we learn this by way of Michael's fast-forwarding through hard work for promotions; through time spent with the family, no matter how much they might annoy you; through 'quality time' with your spouse and through the little things such as traffic jams, which demand patience as you see something through, in spite of how much of a nuisance it is. After all the schlock humour, Click tries to bail itself out by having its lead suffer a series of epiphanies, but it all rings false; the pseudo-philosophical turn it decides to take when Morty arrives on screen and lays out the entire lesson is cringe-inducing, whilst the overall shift in tact is too disruptive and doesn't work. Click is very much the sort of film people such as Jonah Hill or Katie Cassidy, as well as those kids whom played Michael's children at various stages, if indeed they even have acting careers, may very well look back on in years to come and exclaim: 'Yep, the things you've gotta do when you're at the bottom of the chain(!)'. Well, maybe someone like Jonah Hill wont. Meanwhile, for attuned acting veterans such as Walken; there's that sense of 'what else is there that's left to achieve in my long and honourable array of credits?' For all the crass humour and sense of hate towards humankind, Click's message of acceptance and tolerance really ought to fall on deaf ears.",5,1,2,18 February 2010
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Too bad it wasn't done in the style of a 'Vox Populi', since that's about as much as I could've taken of what this particular vampire had to say.
","When we begin, we begin with a quite wonderful opening crane shot detailing the night sky of San Francisco before rearing downwards onto the embittered road level; the camera moves through an array of people on a street lit only by the meekness of an array of tall lamps, as various folk are pushed through with a real sense that the track is trying to get somewhere specific, as if trying to look for someone. Alas, we settle on that of a motel room; a cut to within revealing that of a man standing with his back to us gazing motionlessly out of a window, as a second man jitters together some sound equipment with a far more animated disposition. If the opening crane shot instilled this sense of looking or desiring somebody to zero in on, it is a shame that it is the man whose story is eventually told we've had selected for us; Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire a grotesque spectacle, a spiralling, idiotic freak show of a movie without merit nor a drive for the unabashed and quite disgusting places it goes. It is Brad Pitt playing the titular vampire named Louis de Pointe du Lac, a man who claims to have lived as far back as the late 1700's and is on the way to being immortal, all of which was born out a certain meeting with a certain someone whom gave him unspeakable ability under this guise of what many refer to as Vampirism. Here and now, in the late 1980s, he meets with a reporter named Molloy (Slater) to lay bare his tale, a character fronting the titular interview; Molloy very much acting out the role of the audience in regards to probing certain quandaries and reacting to certain revelations. Jordan's film is little more than a repulsive, flitting circus side-act feeding, if you excuse the pun, off a core premise reading: 'there's a vampire in contemporary times – he's had to kill people to live but never felt good about it; he's lived for two hundred years, and stuff's happened during that time.' Whilst later helming 2005's more rounded and, in comparison to this, certainly more successful Breakfeast on Pluto, as a curiously offbeat male hopping from instance to instance; from locale to locale, some stranger than others; some funnier; some scarier, not once are we provided any stone-wall reason to get behind Pitt's du Lac nor find anything of what happens in Interview with the Vampire remotely anything more than a big, fat and bloody waste of time.We begin with du Lac's life taking a turn for the worst when he looses his wife and child, suicidal ideation then following before he meets that of Lestat; a vampire whom does what is necessary to turn du Lac into what he is, doom him to immortality but essentially grant him a new 'lease of life', so to speak. It is Tom Cruise playing Lestat, an overly encroaching role for a man we usually rather enjoy watching, or indeed backing, in whatever predicament in whatever other film we've seen the man in - a role here which we have precious little pleasure in watching him play, and one in which he brings an aggressive amount of overacting to proceedings. Through a lot of blood; some frayed morals running in sync with a lot of flayed other stuff, du Lac succumbs to his torn mindset and comes to kill a human being in order to survive.Life as a vampire sees these curious beings waltz around sporting big, bulging eyes; veins all over one's face and neck and generally look a little worse for wear as is. In spite of this, they are a big hit on the social scene and especially with the women of the piece. Du Lac and Lestat whisk from one place to another, du Lac's desire to spare human's and seek a more concrete understanding of life as a vampire seeing his philosophical demeanour in stark contrast to that of his friend and rival's lust for blood and misogynist indulgences which often lead on to an array of agonising female death's misguidedly precipitated as cinematic spectacle. Issues open up with the introduction of Kirsten Dunst's character Claudia, the indulging in her relationship with Cruise problematic if only because that old 'unreliable narrator' scourge rears up; an hour or so has gone past and nothing in this guy's life has changed, we're continuing down the blood-lust trail full of murders, of which nobody else around appears to notice, and everything's just a bit gooey and unpleasant.Long after Pitt's character has 'died' within, the film has died on its feet; a deeply unpleasant film covering what is effectively just a lot of killing and nonsense dressed up with tonally self-important voice-overs and this sense of the grandeur: a lot of time goes by, he travels the world; meets an array of people, some die and some do not – all of it amounting to very little bordering on absolutely nothing at all. As du Lac questions his own existence and reasons for presence in this world as what he is, we begin to question why it is that we're all hearing his banal tale at all; a flimsy, misjudged biopic of somebody whose premise for coming about to even exist looses weight very quickly and just becomes very dull on top of what is a bloody, episodic chore covering a great deal but doing very little. The similarly constructed Forrest Gump arrived in cinemas mere months prior to Jordan's mess, a genuinely humorous; fun; life-affirming piece hopping through the ages with a joke every other thirty seconds covering this man's life from one instance to the next - begging the question: why stand when you can sit?",4,1,4,19 July 2011
Jackie Brown," Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, it actually didn't but it couldn't have come closer.
","Tarantino is quoted to have said, when asked about his follow up to Pulp Fiction which caused shock waves throughout the industry and how he would match it, that he knew he couldn't go over Pulp Fiction; so he went under it. In Jackie Brown, Tarantino pulled off from that very sentence what he set out to do. The film is a quite simplistic and laid back experience for most of the time, only branching off at certain points with that distinct flair Tarantino brings to his films when it needs to. This is most evident during the actual trading of bags in the shopping mall, something Tarantino announces is about to happen with a title card and a cheeky fourth wall breaking comment: 'For real this time'.But leading up to this heist or exchange or whatever is a thoroughly rewarding and distinct journey littered with realism; menace; great dialogue; great acting and individual personas for each of the characters. Given that Tarantino includes characters in Jackie Brown of the stoner, surfer bimbo and flight attendant variety and for him to make them come across as anything but the clichés and caricatures we have become to associate with them is a triumph in itself. Part of this is down to casting; having De Niro play Louis, a bank robber recently out of jail and addicted to drugs is one thing but resisting casting a young man in the role and resisting having him talkative and naïve in that 'stoner' caricature we could all associate with him is another. If anything, Louis could take the drugs to keep him calm since the instant we see him spending long amounts of time away from the pad and away from the drugs, he becomes very irritable and somewhat dangerous.Then you have the other 'types' that could so easily have been typecast but people like ATF enforcer Ray Nicolette (Keaton) is more than a typical policeman or agent with a badge and an ego, he wants to help Jackie and at certain points wants to get to know her whilst carrying a certain quirkiness attributed to Keaton's approach to the character. So if Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were all about breaking down stereotypes in a well worn genre then Jackie Brown is the continuation of this, albeit on a lower scale. The film could fall into crime, possibly even neo-noir and quite possibly romance. There are some blurry lines as to who is playing the protagonist in the noir-inspired sense as bail bondsman Max Cherry (Forster) could clearly be given the 'down on his luck' lead role and Jackie the femme fatale or Cherry could simply be labelled an ally and Jackie (who's equally down on her luck) is the anti-hero playing everyone off against each other. The film is named Jackie Brown after all, but if we can learn anything from the final scene and garner anything from the film overall then it's feasible Max is the best and most interesting character.Jackie Brown is perhaps the most conventional of Tarantino's films; certainly at the time and certainly with hindsight also. It adopts a straight and linear path that only become complicated when it branches off to show its several primary characters' actions. In terms of manipulating the linear passage of things, Jackie Brown rarely toys with formula until it is absolutely necessary to drop the viewer into chaos of the mind as they frantically backtrack and work out who's where and why they might be. This is done during the most important scene in the film and feels like the climactic heist as everything comes together and fits into place but really, Tarantino is using it as a set up for the bigger picture; the attempted acquiring of a gun runner.At the core of the film is a strong female character and how often can you come away saying there is such a thing in a film that contains gun runners; stoners and could quite feasibly fall into the noir genre? Incidentally when Max first sees Jackie, played by Pam Grier, leaving the jail house his look is constructed around the gaze theory but one thing I noticed that may be deliberate by Tarantino is that she isn't fetishised or presented in an objective fashion. This is down to two things; firstly Tarantino places her about two dozen feet away from the watching Max and secondly, given the dystopian locale of the jail house we've previously been presented with, Jackie has this aura about her that does not demand an attractive labelling. She is a mess, with scraggly hair; well worn clothes; air miles under her belt for that particular day and generally unglamorous.Following her brush with death at the hands of gunrunner Ordell Robbie (Jackson), who is equally brilliantly set up in all his ruthless glory, the film divulges into the seedy world of apartments bought with blood money, malls, mall car parks and police station offices. The splashes of Tarantino are evident in random flashes of violence; eventual non-linear story telling and a mock cartoon bird's eye view of a flight from Mexico to America. The soundtrack of light, mellow love songs adds a depth to Jackie Brown as Max gently eases his way into feeling for the woman as the meetings escalate between the two. The manner in which each character is fleshed out in their own retrospect's and the efficiency of most scenes involving Jackson's Ordell Robbie as well as Cherry's gradual relationship with Brown are some of the reasons Jackie Brown goes down as and will remain as one of my favourite films.",9,1,2,29 September 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," It stands the test of time.
","Whether you love it or hate it, Monty Python is forever etched into British comedy history and this edition of the filmic Python exploits has stood the test of time, just.The thing with Monty Python is that it's very random. The bizarreness and variedness of the humour is really something to behold and there are numerous examples in this film alone which backs this up. Whether it's a completely random and insane discussion-come-argument about swallows to a really scathing, surreal attack on how the English dealt with the 'black death' or the 'plague' or whatever killer virus' were going around back then, in the carefree manner that is shown. It can be a joy to behold.With this film, we are instantly thrown into a world of confusion as the 'projectionist' actually loads up the wrong film to begin with. From here, you know something's up as no other film that I've ever seen or heard of has a beginning like this and you know that this is going to be different. Once the real film has started, the dialogue in the early scenes superbly juxtaposes the setting in 900 odd B.C. as political arguments and, as I've mentioned, discussions about migratory birds pop up. It feels like an extra long episode of a comic, sketch TV programme which has no real plot, but is just a montage of jokes and hilarious situations the characters find themselves in and this isn't a bad thing. The great thing about this is, is that the early situations and exchanges work as a flame for us, the moths, and it sets the stage very well; drawing us into the world of humour on show. Since no one around now knows exactly what happened in the time of the films setting, no one can argue whether any of this would really happen. Were minstrels who followed people/knights around that annoying? What did knights guarding the turrets of castles actually do/talk about to pass the time? Swallows maybe? Effective little scenarios like this make you wonder and it just adds to the genius of the writing.One of the early scenes has to be one of the funniest in films entire one hundred year plus history. This is the fight scene between Arthur and the black knight. Following on from a good fight scene, the black knight delivers some of the funniest lines in the most funniest of ways following his own decapitation. The line: 'All right, we'll call it a draw.' has me in stitches just thinking about it.One quarrel I have with the film is the animated sequences. Now, they look terribly dated and really aren't that funny. Fortunately, they only last a few seconds (most of them) and don't distract you too much but why even bother to have them in the first place? The titles in-between the knight's own separate stories are fine but little things like the 'artist suddenly having a heart attack' just insult the viewer. Not good, unfortunately.I think most people would have a problem with the characters who talk to the screen, breaking the 'fourth wall', something which was stamped out of narrative film-making decades ago. I had a minor frustration with this as although it only happened twice from memory, it spoilt what was a perfectly good/funny scene. The incident in the castle full of young girls is the one which immediately springs to mind as she starts talking to the audience. In an analytical sense, this is actually supposed to add to the experience in the sense that it's all theatre anyway and this film shouldn't be taken seriously. It's fun and farcical and that's all that matters. I didn't let it get away with it when it came to the rating, though.This film's great to watch alone, especially if you've not seen it either before or for a very long time. If you've never experienced Python before, then this is a great appetiser and remember  there are two other films and plenty of TV series' as-well.",7,1,2,13 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Difficult to see all the fuss and love nowadays as much as those present for its inauguration did.
","Good lord, what spell does George Lucas have everyone under? This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays.Maybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. Perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. But I do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself  they don't ask themselves the question 'How good was the film?', they ask themselves 'How happy was I as a kid when I first saw this?'.For the record, I liked the previous episode. I thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. You really believed Lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. This twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence Lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure.Alas, Episode V entitled 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. Its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in Luke Skywalker (Hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a Jedi whilst friends Han Solo (Ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones).'Fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. But if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. Once all that has happened, Vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold.Maybe it's that I cannot just let myself go, but I had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. In this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. The film's protagonist Luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with Yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas Solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. Why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name Leia (Fisher).But these things are the bigger picture. The film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. Of course, Solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. One thing I noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the Millennium Falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes Luke off into his training with Yoda is a near death experience on ice planet Hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten.Towards the end of the film, Luke will be having a showdown with Vader after which a famous line is uttered. All well and good but Luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight Vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to  we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new Jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. This is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. All in all, The Empire Strikes Back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything. Perhaps proof 'event cinema' can and never will withstand the true test of time.",6,8,19,7 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," 'Laugh it up, fuzzball...'
","In a 'post-classical' era, films are often quite simplistic - they are driven by high-concepts and childish premises; experiencing them is fragmented by tie-in merchandising and the like. They concentrate on action too much, substituting character psychology. Or so the argument goes in Bordwell & Thompson's 2006 book 'Film Art' - whether or not you agree with any of this, there is no questioning Star Wars' role in facilitating it.'The Empire Strikes Back' was the first sequel to the hugely successful 1977 blockbuster 'A New Hope' - picking up where the other left off but, strangely, not really feeling like it does an awful lot to advance what we witnessed other than put its protagonist through a training regime and have his friends chased around space by some villains for 90 minutes. How far have things REALLY been advanced by the time this 1980 effort has finished, beyond a quaint love story and a jarring familial revelation?The film's opening act takes place on a barren, wintry planet called Hoth. Following the destruction of the Death Star at the end of Episode 4, a weapon capable of destroying a single planet in one foul strike, a military group known as 'the Rebels' retreat in the wake of an Empirical counter-attack, which involves despatching robotic probes to various parts of the galaxy to scout the potential positions. What everyone is fighting for, we still don't know. Later on, during a conversation about mineral mining in a visually impressive city built into the sky, it is inferred the fighting is to do with control of natural resources.When we first see the series' hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), on the surface of Hoth in a blizzard, he looks a little like an alien in his arctic gear complete with goggles and mouth-scarf - you might say he bears a passing resemblance to the film's villain, Darth Vader, whose jet-black helmet covers his entire face and gives him a similar un-human quality. Skywalker unfurls his coverings, looking far more grizzled than in the first film. We are then lulled into a false sense of security when ally Han Solo (Harrison Ford) confirms over a radio that the 'sensors' are in place. Job done, we conclude - but Luke is ambushed by a snow monster and dragged off to its cave.Not returning, and with Solo out there looking for him, the base takes the decision to close the main doors as the dark creeps in and the perishing cold become overwhelming. Cleverly, director Irvin Kershner focuses on the pained expression of Princes Leia (Carrie Fisher) as they shut - whose fate does she fear for the most? Luke's escape from the Yeti provides us with a tantalising early look at the power of the lightsaber, which takes the monster's arm clean off - an important detail for a later duel... But why does Luke then LEAVE the safety of the cave as the storm rages? Why did the film have him caught in the first place? Half-dying in the snow, he has a vision of dead friend Obi-wan (Alec Guinness) who tells him to seek 'Yoda' on another planet so that he may complete Jedi training, but we know that Obi-wan can appear at any time to tell him this - Luke doesn't need to be on his last legs and think he's hallucinating.Eventually, one of those enemy probes passes by the base, but the Rebels mysteriously attack it when the plan was to maintain invisibility - why not just let it pass? Cover blown, the Empire attack - but are the Rebels evacuating the base or defending it? We're not sure. Irrespectively, the act ends when the Hoth fight ends - Solo; Leia; Chewbacca and a friendly robot named C3PO leave on Solo's ship whereas Skywalker departs to find Yoda with R2D2.From here, the film cuts into two halves: Luke's strand is slow, methodical and contemplative as he spends time on a jungle planet with a small green alien learning how to perfect abilities in 'the force', whereas Solo and the gang endure a more causality driven experience as Vader's ship pursues them through asteroid belts; the stomachs of giant worms and cities built into the clouds.What becomes curious about the film at this stage is that the antagonist, Vader, makes a conscious decision to pursue Skywalker not to kill him, but capture him so that they may join together as villains. In addition to this, an entire passage of the film beds said protagonist down in one place so that he may learn about patience; concentration and being contemplative - hardly things associated with 'post-classical' cinema. By today's standards, this is positively blockbuster revisionism. But surely there is a hole in Skywalker's training: is he not working towards wrecking a revenge on Vader? Isn't this contrary to the force's teachings?Solo's strand is more simplistic, more familiar to this post-Star Wars era blockbuster school: the bad-guys are chasing the good-guys; there is a meagre romance between Solo and Leia - royalty mingling with common-folk. Amusingly, Kershner uses a recurring gag to do with Solo's ship's power-thrust mechanic failing to roar into action when he needs it, and we grin at the metaphor. Strikingly, very little of any real interest happens on this strand which seems present to keep people amused as the other stuff plays out.I read and hear of people remarking how much 'darker' the film's tone is, and so it is better than IV, but I would disagree. Tonally, the films seem quite similar - certainly, the characters here are in hairier situations, but so what? It ends on more of a downbeat note, for Skywalker; Solo and even Vader, but does so in order to tee up the next film, not because its ending is in line with any kind of thematic it's exploring. How is one to conclude now, almost 40 years on from the changing of the cinematic guard? 'Empire...' is functional, but perhaps undeserved of its status.",6,0,0,9 March 2019
Sin City," Rodriguez' brilliant, eye-opening, maddening tale of all things noir and nasty is one of my favourites.
","The night comes across as glum; she's pretty, and he's handsome. They stand on a balcony, well dressed and looking smart. She seems scared, he seems allured but the actual reasons for his presence are deeper and more sinister than you'd first think. They look at one another; the male narrates to us how he feels; colours light up, as do the final cigarettes one of the two parties will ever have. The cigarette smoke jostles with the death that is in the air, only we cannot see it just yet. They embrace, and after this fatal exchange we crash backwards off the balcony overlooking a peculiar skyline before zooming out to encompass a bird's eye view of the entire town. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Basin City.On release, Sin City was a noir like nobody had ever seen before, indeed, I have seen few films since that have come close to matching the film as a whole. The film is a strange mix of down-to-Earth basics and homages to noir mixed with out and out escapism. The film's dynamics see characters shot, stabbed, run-over, blown-up and beaten senseless yet still manage to soldier on; whereas cars can shoot along rainy cliff-side roads at dizzying speeds but maintain on course and in control without ever crashing off. Despite all of this, the film maintains a focus; it sticks to its noir infused guns like nobody's business, delivering three stories of unrelenting passion and energy that unfold in a manner that is respectable enough to most things it takes on; be it difficult subject matter, levels of realism or attitudes to women.The film is broken up into three tales of respective men in crisis, three tales that you might say are linked by their leads' attitudes and dedication to women. The first, and last since it's revisited later on, sees elderly cop John Hartigan (Willis) involved in a rescue mission before a somewhat taboo romance tale; the second is a frothing mad revenge tale driven by love born out of the respect a woman had for a hulking thug named Marv (Rourke); while the other one is a causality inspired, MacGuffin driven piece detailing the misadventures of a certain Dwight (Owen), as he strives to rid a section of Basin City of a particular object that'll spell disaster for hundreds. Some are more violent than others, some more far-fetched; Hartigan's story is the easiest to latch onto due to its obvious connotations of good vs. pure evil playing out; two stories will end somewhat unhappily and one particular tale will straddle the line that pushes subject matter into the realms of horror. But all three will draw on inspiration from decades of Hollywood noir and deliver powerful, gut-wrenching fables of down and dirty people striving to get by told amidst levels of exciting entertainment and escapism.Director Robert Rodriguez knows where he's coming from with Sin City. By way of updating a series of graphic novels, littering them with a number of homages and using the latest in computer green-screen technology, he's created something that he will not match for the rest of his career. From the off, the first story entitled That Yellow Bastard is littered with nods and references. Hartigan, the gruff talking and close to down-and-out cop, drives his car down a straight road although needlessly twists his steering wheel in what instantly calls to mind 1945's Detour, amongst many other B-movie noirs, and their dodgy backdrops. A few miles away, a young healthy girl named Nancy sits tied to a chair, scared witless, as a door opens and Rodriguez tosses in that element of expressionism as a creepy and evil being casts a shadow over the wall, perhaps calling to mind Fritz Lang's 1931 film M. Later on, we will come to understand the Sunset Blvd. reference Rodriguez was, like that respective film, playing us with the whole time.On another strand, we're told Marv was unlucky to be born in the wrong century thanks to his uncanny ability to reach distressing levels of violence. This plants some dangerous seeds in our minds as to what he's capable of. We don't get to see him in a Roman arena, swinging an axe into some other gladiator's head, but later on we get to see him swing a hatchet into a corrupt police officer's. Marv is a human tank; a self-identified border-line psychopath whose tale tiptoes over the border that separates noir from horror, all for sake of Goldie (King), a lowlife hooker that made Marv feel important and wanted. Rodriguez will have him struggle (as he will Dwight in the tar-pits) in the rural farm setting before breaking trend and have him come to dominate this locale. The punishment Marv takes throughout is reminiscent to that of those 1980s Hollywood action stars, and how their bodies would be beaten and bashed and put through a grinder.Dwight is one-part mockingly, one-part knowingly referred to as 'Lancelot' in his story entitled The Big Fat Kill, since his role as protector to domestic abuse victim Shellie (Murphy) might see him as a knight in shining armour. Later on, he becomes a knight of sorts to Old Town based dominatrix Gail (Dawson) and the rest of her red-light district girls when a group of dangerously sexually active men enter the fray; their sexual appetites costing them their lives by Japanese bodyguard Miho (Aoki) and her phallic samurai sword. But the film is not all men protecting women by way of holding their hand. Indeed, it explores the lengths certain men are willing to go for the female and Shellie's and Nancy's repeated attempts to stand up to their male aggressors in Jackie Boy and The Yellow Bastard, respectively, see them more than mere objects that need saving. Sin City is one of my favourites of the decade; a whirling, spinning experience of a film – the likes of which all should see.",10,2,4,30 November 2009
Gangs of New York," Several basic conventions stand out: acting, sets, costumes but the film changes its mind half way though and thus relegates itself to good rather than great.
","A lot of people may love Martin Scorsese but I feel the best word to use to describe him would be: consistent. Scorsese is showing no evidence of lacking in his more recent stages as a director, in fact The Departed recently won Best Picture and Gangs of New York is still an enjoyable film, albeit not great, for the best part.With the film set up superbly thanks to a long and bloody street fight and the main character of Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) established, the film looks like it'll go down that route of revenge but that's the one major thing that sticks out  it changes its mind half way through. Apart from Amsterdam's backstory, returning to New York and rising the ladder in order to get closer to his revenge; the film isn't really about anything. For some reason, Amsterdam isn't in every scene but when revenge is the story's drive, how should be. Instead, we get a few nothing scenes set in an office full of caged birds and just general chat involving the antagonist Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Day-Lewis).Once most of the dross settles down, Gangs of New York evolves into exactly what I thought it would be: A well shot, brilliantly choreographed, well acted film about one man's rise up the male dominated world of gangs and gangsters. Amsterdam gets into fist fights, actually helps out Bill now and again to gain extra trust, has encounters with the loose women that populate that world and just generally hangs out and makes friends. Why the film couldn't remain like this, only the filmmakers will know.Although it sounds fantastic, there are still one or two things that just stick out. The strangest of which was the feeling I got when I wasn't sure whether or not I was supposed to laugh. There are some scenes that just don't seem to need to be there; the one in particular is the hanging scene: was it meant to be funny? What was the point of it? and Why didn't those 'guilty' put up more of a fight to escape if they'd done nothing? You see, scenes like this and a few others from memory just don't seem to have a purpose  if it was to emphasise Bill's evilness then it was still unnecessary.These few things aside, Gangs of New York will counteract anything negative with something positive. The scene Amsterdam and Bill share after the orgy is particularly memorable as not only do we find out more about Bill than we already knew but we also get the feeling Amsterdam has won his trust. There's also a scene involving Irish immigrants coming of the boats as soldiers (who probably aren't coming back) go on  fuelling the racist hate the film has simmering throughout it. Two fantastic scenes that contain so much more than meets he eye but why the pointless scenes are included anyway is beyond me. Like I said earlier, the revenge plot line I had hoped for came but unfortunately; then went. Gangs of New York then turns political as a twist involving Amsterdam and Bill occurs and they must now go against one another in the form of words; a sort of 'Cold War' between the hero and the villain if you like. This was different and consequently disappointing although the final payoff is enjoyable and leaves a good feeling of closure.I labelled Scorsese 'consistent' in my opening but this particular film is 'inconsistent'. It starts out on a revenge path, contains elements of racism but turns political and what with the World Trade Centre involved at the end, it's like the film's trying to give a message that nobody really wants to hear but with brilliant sets and misé-en-scene, Gangs of New York is worth a look.",7,0,0,13 August 2007
Windtalkers," Woo's Best Film Gives Us An Enlightening Look Into Radio Operating.
","All though Windtalkers may be listed as a war film, it's more primarily one of those epic action film as the vast scenes of quick editing, gun fire and over the top death scenes from the soldiers make it so but that is what you'd come to expect from John Woo, this is very much a John Woo war film and we can tell. The plot, revolving around native Americans and their secret language that the axis power of Japan cannot decipher is a breath of fresh air and a good basis for the story. It is refreshingly unique as it's something that I hadn't seen before in a war film; again, it seems more suited to an action film's plot ie; protecting certain people from an 'enemy' as seen in perhaps the three 'Terminator' films which are obviously high budget action films only with a war 'THEME', rather than basis. The setting is as glorious as you'd expect but it doesn't matter as much as it is a simple 'go in and take the island' mission which is bizarre as the mission in this film really doesn't qualify at all in terms of importance, it's all about the radio operators and their job. This brings me onto the other characters. It's difficult to recognise each character individually as the main focus is around the two characters that of Joe Enders (Played by Cage) and his Windtalker: 'Yahzee'. We don't really get much of a chance to focus too much on anyone else apart from Charlie, Yahzee's friend from his village. Cage's character also adopts too much of a 'Rambo' figure in the film. It seems that Japanese soldiers drop just as quickly in this film as a 50 odd handicapped golfer drops shots in a standard round. It is very reminiscent to that of Vietnamese soldiers in Rambo's second outing.This doesn't distract from the films battle scene quality. This is by far the best Woo can do when in comparison to that of 'Mission Impossible 2' or 'Hard Target', albeit that they were over the top in their own sense but this does have a slight hint of realism flavour. Be it the brutal opening exchanges on the Solomon Islands or the scenario best described by saying 'the Allies in this trench versus the Axis in the other trench. Let the mayhem begin', there is definitely something there for everyone and the action is realistic and accurate.",6,2,4,20 July 2005
Spectre," Watchable entry in the franchise which balances substance and spectacle with the odd stumble.
","'Spectre' promises a tremendous deal from its opening: a long tracking shot through the Day of the Dead celebrations in Mexico City, extravagant costumes and skeletal masks everywhere, and a low boring soundtrack as the instruments in the scene do battle with the music composed specially for the sequence. The film does not quite live up to these beginnings, in fact settles down into being somewhat of a strange experience which, I think, probably thought it was delivering something more powerful than it actually is, and ends up being a film which, despite the places it goes with a much-loved character, can only really induce a nod of approval when all has been said and done.But to delve too deeply here into precisely what I am referring to would spoil the surprise. Indeed, an odd thing happened some years ago off the back of people close to me settling down to watch 'Spectre' - I remarked how interesting it was that the character of Blofeld was back. To my immense surprise, I was greeted by a 'tut' and told, despite not actually having seen it at that time, that that constituted '...a spoiler'.Blofeld is indeed back - having last been seen during the opening sequence of 'Octopussy', wheelchair bound and fluffy white cat in tow, wherein he was ambushed by Roger Moore's incarnation of the famous superspy and dropped down an industrial chimney in one of London's less glamorous areas. I am sure I read on the Internet Movie Database, some years ago, that the reason for ridding the franchise of the character had something to do with the dated feel Blofeld was weighing the series down with, and that the producers wanted to remove all doubt that he might make a return as a villain. What goes around comes around - 'the dead are alive', as it were. Funny how in 'Skyfall', the franchise made a point to tell us that it was done with silly things like exploding pens, but here provides Bond with an exploding watch.The crux of 'Spectre' is essentially a political essay on surveillance; probably its most interesting character is Bond's boss, M, played by Ralph Fiennes, and the conflict chiefly derives from the on-going spat he has with a younger, more cock-sure version of himself played by Andrew Scott. Scott plays a character called Max, whose office is in a big new plush building with a postmodern glass exterior, whereas M's office appears older and more traditional with a lot of wood panelling et al.There is bad news afoot for the Military Intelligence branch both M and James Bond (Daniel Craig) are, and have been, a part of for all these years: advances in surveillance technology are rendering Bond more and more obsolete; soon, the powers that be will have access to the intelligence information belonging to nine of the world's most powerful nations, simultaneously, completely negating the need for agents in the field. Later conflict over the issue is inferred early on when Max and Bond meet face to face in profile and James is told in no uncertain terms that this will change the double-0 section immeasurably. A spate of recent terror attacks around the world, often in the nations who are holding out against the legislation, are convincing people that this surrender to intergovernmentalism is the way forward. Eventually, Bond sets out to find out why.The usual ingredients are there: the hero gets a nice car and a female accomplice enters the fray later on. Generally, the film lacks a villain; the hit-man the bad-guys employ to do away with Bond is a big, silent Jaws-like assassin called Mr. Hinx who even gets into a well-choreographed fight with Bond and the girl on a train. Unfortunately, character motivation on the villains' behalf does not entirely add up: why attempt to kill Bond at all if your plan ultimately involves shutting down his division? And why, if there is such an integral connection between hero and villain, and they are destined to meet one another nearer the end at a desert base, make all the attempts on his life?More interesting to Mendes, and certainly to us, is the stuff on surveillance: the morality of it versus the fight against terrorism it seems vital to combatting. But how, as M points out, do you use it and who exactly has access to it anyway? The film certainly picks its side in the end, although it is generally all a bit of a strained attempt to remain topical - the franchise is essentially at war with its own beating core of depicting heroism and escapism: if Bond always saves the day, and the world can always rest easy in the knowledge he's out there to do so, what is the need for surveillance in the first place? Grown-ups know that in the real world, things work very differently. My mind drifts back to an article Christopher Hitchens wrote the day after 9/11, dryly beginning about how said spectacle is what happens when a hero like James Bond drops the ball, or doesn't make it in time to thwart the enemies.Amusingly, much later on, a character is arrested on what is described as 'The Special Measures Act'. Despite actually having been incorporated into something else as far back at 2005, this Act originally caused much consternation in Britain through its attitude to civil liberties, the core of what 'Spectre' is about. This name-drop, more interesting than the finale around which it is mentioned, gets the broadest smile; the rest of the film is generally amusing but unspectacular.",6,0,4,23 September 2019
Braveheart," With a head and a heart in the right place, Braveheart comes off as a towering achievement of hope, love and tragedy.
","Braveheart is a stunning film, a film that takes you on a turning and unravelling journey of hope and tragedy but never veers off into a realm of out and out escapist fantasy. It's a film that remains grounded and compelling, even with a long runtime and not for a second if we're into the film at the level I was do we ever feel it's moving too slowly. Here is a film that follows the adventures of just an everyday boy made-man and put through the grinder. He interacts with the people in his surroundings and his surroundings in general; comes to love someone; comes to hate someone else; must rediscover himself following a tragedy and the underlying theme is resilience or battling for what you believe.I think Braveheart works on its own level because of its grounded reality and it works better than later films that were perhaps inspired by it in the form of Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven. There is a constant, grounded sense of realism in Braveheart. At its core, you could read into it as a revenge story but the idea is ambiguous due to there being no distinct enemy as to whom garner vengeance from. Indeed, any retribution the protagonist gets from killing as a result of killing is done swiftly and, in his eyes, justly shortly after the initial death happened. In many-another film, the obligatory scene of the protagonist getting his revenge from the 'bad guy' that killed someone the protagonist loved would happen ten minutes, maybe more, from the end. In Braveheart it occurs after about half an hour thus rendering the rest of the film a different beast.The film is unlike Gladiator in this respect, which was an out and out revenge film for the death of a family. It is unlike Kingdom of Heaven which was a really poorly done and ropey journey of self discovery with a dull lead and sprawling narrative complete with racist tone. Braveheart achieves in about forty-five minutes what most of these two films (try to) accomplish in their entire runtimes. What begins and then ends as a tale of anger and payback actually escalates into a full blown story about uprising and one's right to live without oppression.The film centres on William Wallace, played very briefly at the start by James Robinson as a child but then by co-producer and overall director Mel Gibson. Gibson plays the character with a certain innocence early on as he engages in the oppressed world in which he lives. He tries to avoid the English and their grip on the nation, going so far as to defy them and their rules by marrying childhood sweetheart Murron MacClannough (McCormack) behind everyone's back but he does so in a cheeky manner in order to try and beat the system and avoid one of the English higher-ups being allowed to 'take' the newlywed for one night. What follows is a brief diversion into another arc mentioned before the main course of the uprising.The film carries a distinct post-modern feel. Wallace uses odd tactics to 'woo' his bride to be; methods perhaps usually seen, invented even, in the modern age. Simple things such as throwing pebbles at a window in order to arouse attention from a loved one but these romantic elements to do with love are combined with older, more traditional beliefs or 'conventions' such as proceeding to be married first, in order to share an embrace. The film actually begins with Wallace's father dying and the young Wallace at the time being sent off for 'training'; training of the body but also of the mind  to say we will get a glimpse of the results of this tantalising set up is an understatement.Due to the film's nature of going one up on itself after it has dealt with the mini-narrative of revenge, we expect the film to get tuned up a level because of the uprising plot. Braveheart does this but it does so without resorting to mass battle scenes and cut-a-millisecond sequences that would distort the film, this could be seen as an action film but that doesn't mean we need action all the time. The film is a pot-boiler, a film that lends time to studies and other characters: the king of England nicknamed 'Longshanks' (McGoohan); a French princess named Isabelle (Marceau) and several allies within the Scottish camp. Wallace is constantly referred to as not a hero, purely because he doesn't 'look' like one with his short build and unattractive face but this is the film observing heroic clichés and going against them whilst pointing them out.The film plays out like a game of chess, complete with battles; strategic moving around and ambushes of various different pieces armed with different weapons. Even the king himself is on the field at certain points making moves. Additionally, the parallels between young, upcoming heroes is made clear: Wallace and the future king of England are given sporadic case-studies in the sense they're both young but Wallace has nothing at his disposal and acts out of emotion chasing everything whereas the prince is young and has everything at his disposal complete with an assured future but shies away from it  the point is how they go about their lives and how much certain things mean to them, although their overall fates might extinguish the theory. Regardless, Braveheart is a big; broad and cracking epic that everyone should see.",9,3,8,14 December 2008
Moon," Ground control to director Jones. Can you hear me? You've made a good 'un.
","Moon quite wonderfully captures the sheer vastness of science fiction and yet works as equally well, if not better as, a stripped down and simplistic study of the human condition. Moon is a project all about the sorts of themes, ideas and emotions that have been, and will always be, acquitted with humankind; whatever the year and wherever the locale. On this occasion, the emotions and thematic elements of isolation and loneliness are explored under the watchful eye of the science-fiction genre and unravel on Planet Earth's sole Moon. And then there's the word 'Moon', merely four letters long but used to describe something so big; so exciting; so mysterious and so seemingly far away. Jupier get something ridiculous like sixty of the damn things, we only get the one.Here, the titular satellite orbiting our planet is used as a backdrop for some rather humbling scenes revolving around raw human emotion; some confusion and ambiguity as the lines between drama and horror are blurred as well as a scathing attack on the working commercial world in which we live and work. 'Where are we now?' asks the voice in the opening scene, a montage of the vast technological developments of our time. Where indeed are we now? Going by both Moon's content and overall study, the developments over time in regards to modernity have aided those big, evil corporations by expanding into space and putting people through the proverbial sausage factory without them even realising. Without spoiling anything too greatly: 'Where are we now?' – technology and the ability to travel into space and set up on the Moon has advanced in the world of this film, but the same old humankind ideologies of working for a set period; doing your time; outliving your usefulness and then being 'replaced' seem to have stuck.You get that feeling writer/director Duncan Jones identifies his setting as a wide, eye-opening and somewhat beautiful place if you looked at it right, and yet deliberately keeps everything restricted; locked down and focused on those within the small space centre in which most of the events unfold. Jones' ability to cover so much ground and yet essentially keep his characters within the parameters of half a dozen rooms is extraordinary, yet again acting as an example that sees people and characters journey long and far within their minds and yet only ever really cover a physical distance of a few dozen feet – let's say half a mile when they're outside on the Moon's surface.Moon sees a certain American astronaut by the name of Sam (Rockwell) suffer, struggle and eventually come to limp his way through what can only really be described as some sort of tour of duty, on the Moon, working for a large company called Lunar Industries - the word 'luna', of which, is Spanish for 'Moon'. His role sees him wake up; do whatever he needs to initially do; talk to the base's on board computer, named GERTY (Spacey), about this and that before spending not-all-that-much-time extracting 'Helium-3' from the Moon's soil so that it may be used back on Earth for certain purposes. For all the technology; for all the awe of supposedly travelling to the Moon and being situated on the Moon for 'x' number of months, the job boils down to that of a farmer, or that of a bean counter trained to push a few buttons and shift incoming 'goods'. This changes, however, a while into the film when a crash in a vehicle outside on the surface kicks off some rather strange events.It is again to Jones' great credit that he keeps the momentum and the intensity going throughout the build up to a rather dramatic unveiling later on. I think it's fair to say at this point that a second Sam turns up for whatever reason, but the film draws us into the first Sam's mindset so much that interpretation and guess-work will still play a part on the viewer's behalf when sitting down to watch it. Sam comes across as weak, soft-bodied even, in his mannerisms and general behaviour when hallucinations of women sitting in chairs and eerie images of himself decked out in full astronaut gear reaching up from the bottom of a bed become apparent. He watches video messages from back home; they glitch and skip a beat - is something up? Is he going mad? Is the machinery wearing out, or is HE beginning to wear out to some degree. Moon draws on inspiration from some pretty far reaching and understandably heavy weight science fiction films from decades gone by; drawing on inspiration from and paying homage to, but never feeling like trying to go higher than. Jones knows the level he's at here, and with this as his rather accomplished debut, anticipating his next venture will be a joy.",7,1,4,12 December 2009
True Romance," Clumsy, scattershot and mostly devoid of any real substance, True Romance is a flash in the pan thriller with bits-and-pieces going for it.
","Nothing in True Romance is especially mature, but that doesn't stop it from being quite the little blast of cine-literate pulp nonsense. Some of it's funny, some of it's actually quite disturbing; most of it has a lot to do with drugs and pimps, and lowlifes killing other lowlifes to an omnipresent rock-'em-sock-'em aesthetic; it's put together in this manner that has it creep along the line of what's acceptable and what isn't, but it works in the long run if for the time you're sitting there watching it. To state that it's one of the best films a certain Tony Scott ever made speaks volumes; to say the likes of those such as Brad Pitt went on to play roles much more interesting in films that were a lot better speaks even greater volumes. Most of the film is good value; very little of it is especially grown-up; it's tone and content, which will sway wildly from stoner comedy to one of the two leads receiving a beating from a mobster in a nasty little scene, just about holds together with this dumb, infectious energy constantly ticking it over in the engine room.Christian Slater plays Clarence Worley, a store clerk in his twenties; a sensitive and kind, although schizophrenic, man who craves a female presence in his life and talks with great enthusiasm about things that are dear to him, namely comic books; Elvis Presley tracks and import kung-fu films of the 1970s. When I think of a 'Clarence', I think of a deliberately dorky looking character in a Gary Larson sketch. He sits at a bar, during the opening scene, and talks to a sex worker about these things, but he's out of his depth - as if he's too nice-a guy to be in this zone speaking to this calibre of person, but so starved of anything remotely of Clarence's ilk is the zone within which he's based, that he must resort to such places and people. She is disinterested, but then again of course she is.Cut to an establishing shot of where we are: a grim looking Detroit with a grey cloud over it and a generally gloomy atmosphere. Fate appears to deliver an amiable blow when another young sex worker, Patricia Arquette's Alabama, enters the cinema within which Clarence is watching a kung-fu film and sits next to him. They bond, appear to get along and before True Romance's second act can even stretch its legs in preparation to enter the fray, they are married. Clarence is happy he's quashed his desire for someone female and with the apparent interest in what he likes and Alabama's search for some sort of consistency in this, her trek up from far and away Florida, has led her to young Clarence.Where Slater's character lived for the adventure in his movies, and could only feel passion and love for certain comic books in that he's very protective of certain rare varieties of them, he is now able to direct unto Alabama this enthusiasm to keep something that needs protecting as pristine as possible as well as experience the adventure and dangers abound in his films and comic books. This is born out of what lies within the threatening circles within which Alabama operated prior to knowing Clarence: specifically, her pimp Drexl (Oldman) and the fact he takes issue with this newly formed matrimony. The point of no return is crossed; this first barrier the 'new' Clarence must hurdle if he is to live out his fantasies and maintain what it is he's found after years of searching accomplished in his killing of Drexl. Once carried out, the pair of them head for Los Angeles out of the fact somewhat skewered twist of fate that saw Clarence grab a case of cocaine upon leaving Drexl's abode, with the mobsters (the true owners of the drugs) out looking for it too.It's no secret the film loses a lot of its energy and verve upon its arrival in California; primarily out of the fact they get there too quickly and the early poking around under this cloud of gloom and apparent despair as a young guy and a young girl fall in love and try to work around this psychotic pimp is quite good. I've never been fond of crime films set in sunny, bright nor indeed welcoming locales, but what's lacking here is much for Clarence and Alabama to actually get up to. We do not, to the film's ultimate detriment, have the leads' journey to L.A. depicted; a passage of time rife with the potential for dramatic ingredients and the opportunity for a stone-wall antagonist to establish themselves so that it might provide these two leads something to do. There is the potential for this sort of material, in that Christopher Walken plays the boss of a group of these mobsters looking for their cocaine, whose verbal standoff with Clarence's father as he strives to find where they've gone calls to mind the best of what True Romance writer Tarantino can do: think the opening scene of Inglourious Basterds or the final scenes of Pulp Fiction. Alas, he disappears after this one sequence. Credit must go to Christian Slater, who does well in his depiction of someone going from being this weak clerk to a hardened guy having to punch well above his weight, but the film lacks any sort of backbone. Its persistency to use Malick's overture from Badlands serves only to remind us how good that film was, whereas with hindsight, one is able to point out how Tarantino forged an early forte out of depicting partnerships, or couples, dodging bullets and doing crime as apparent in Natural Born Killers; From Dusk 'til Dawn or strands of Pulp Fiction. This is the lesser of the four, and not particularly brilliant as a standalone film either.",6,4,11,23 March 2013
Slumdog Millionaire," Wonderful and engaging film about an apparent no-hoper breaking through the breach told amidst a canvas of the funny, touching and of the eerie.
","Slumdog Millionaire is a journey; a trip down an individual's memory lane as he recounts the struggles in his life that has, ultimately, given him his opportunity to win big amidst struggles to do with the fact he is suspected of cheating. The film is of the humbling variety, the uplifting and of the downbeat for good measure  chances are you'll laugh; chances are you'll cry and the chances are you'll feel most everything else in-between. English director Danny Boyle has created something that throws just about everything into the mix, but arises as something far, far more than a disposable gimmick. The film's visual approach is one that teeters between the chaotic and the calm, pausing for those tense and dramatic moments of thought and recollection whilst nicely integrating the urgent scenes of chase and memory recollection. The film's pacing and approach is one of a careful nature, one that criss-crosses numerous genres yet remains focused on its study.Boyle identifies the route the film is going to go down in the opening few shots. After an establishment that we are in India, 2006; Boyle presents us with two extremes immediately announcing the overall tone of the film. Jamal Malik (Patel) sits in a chair in an interrogation room and is hit around the face as he is questioned in urgent, close up format. Running parallel with this and in the past tense, he is sitting in another chair  the self-proclaimed 'hotseat' - attempting to win big on India's 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' quiz show. Still being grilled and still the central figure of ridicule from the host and the audience, he wades onward.The juxtaposition of being interrogated and electrocuted as a part of that, twinned with the fun; seemingly good natured; rather upbeat and familiar setting of the 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' television studio is an instant and sticking one. Boyle manages to get across the range of emotions he'll deliver in the film, often all within a short space of time, as well as establish the manipulation of time that he hopes to accomplish.Needless to say, he achieves it and how. Frequently, there will be passages during which the film will flicker from something quite light hearted to real potential danger and then back again to the television studio as the tension is racked up to do with being the focus of attention. Some incidences include, very early on, when Jamal and some other boys from the slums play cricket on a runway and happily play away despite the immediate danger from landing planes. This activity is then interrupted by hostile guards who pose a new danger but then the kids seem to have fun in escaping.The film is an account, an account of times past by someone who many deem to be in a position they do not feel is possible. The primary theme is underestimation, that a 'slumdog' as Jamal is called, cannot possibly know anything and thus, when he's on the brink of cracking the show's top prize he must've cheated. But the accusers do not know any better. All through Jamal's life, incidences and objects have forced him to pick up on tidbits of trivia that have stuck and on the quiz show, it has aided him in getting as far as he has. The delving into the past as a new question arises consistently offers a refreshing tale within an initially gripping premise. During the film, we learn of his brother and his predicaments as well as the scraps, jobs and potential love interests he finds himself in offering a range: from the humorous, to the touching, to the downright creepy.Jamal sits opposite Prem Kumar (Kapoor), the game's host. They aren't in direct competition despite the banter they share but the study is quite clear and that is to do with what's on the surface and what's below it. Nobody believes a 'slumdog' could get to where they are in the game but through Jamal's accounts, it is possible; whereas Prem comes across as a friendly and upbeat television personality who's game for a laugh although backstage, we see him for what he really is. This is the key distinction between the two and the chief study for these sequences: underestimation and what is on the surface vs. what is below the surface.Although essentially a love story and a film that strongly believes in its themes of fate, the film doesn't concentrate on any particular aspect too much or too little thus creating a mystical aura as all these emotions and events and so forth flash by, dragging you through each of them but always giving you a chance to absorb what's being presented. The liberties to do with the questions being presented to him in the chronological order of his life anyway did not bother me, nor did the fact they paused for a commercial break during a live question. Slumdog Millionaire is effective dramatically and touching at the other times it needs to be; tapping into hope and the errors of people's ways when labelling a certain 'type' of individual. It is certainly worth a look.",8,2,4,15 January 2009
Donnie Darko," Demands multiple viewings.
","Donnie Darko is an entertaining, well thought out film with a mysterious aura and a sense of mystery and foreboding throughout. These rare and difficult elements that have been woven into this film combine with several other things creating something memorable.There is a healthy mix of rather dark humour early on as we witness our hero swearing at and around his family which integrates with the amusing one-liners he is using them with. This is combined with the suspense which builds and surprises which crop up now and again very early on in the film. You are left guessing and attempting to work things out from the very first frame. The feeling that everything is, in actual fact, normal is very much present as there are no complicated settings, nor are there unfamiliar characters. Everything is everyday and familiar, in fact the closest thing there is to any abnormality when it comes to the setting is the time of the film takes place which is in the late 1980's.This clash of an everyday world setting but mysterious aura throughout works very well as we attempt to work out what's going on but at the same time, realise that the mysterious element is still there through the character of Donnie. One other thing is that the rest of the characters seem to act 'crazy' in their own unique way. Everyone has a fault and everyone has a goal; whether it be a schizophrenic trying to work out what's going on, a pervert trying to 'heal' people or even if it's an obsessive person bent on making sure a certain music band containing young girls is a success over everything else. Each person is searching and we, the audience, are searching with them. We are with them through their highs and lows and Donnie's therapy sessions act as checkpoints for this journey as we go deep into his mind during hypnosis. This little technique acts as a good suspense filler too, but it often also produces a few laughs. This is very clever.Throughout this film, there is a definite element of confusion. I was never 100% sure as to what was going on but this is healthy as films like this demand a second viewing anyway. We ask ourselves: what do the dreams mean? Why is all this happening and what's causing it? This, to me, made me feel like the film was coming together like a puzzle and every time a dream came along, it was as if I'd suddenly found a piece which linked up several others. The film unravels in this way and it's not too demanding yet at the same time, it doesn't insult the viewer.With wonderful music throughout, using both popular tracks from the era and instrumental music, along with a clever manipulation of the speed of the footage; both fast and slow, Donnie Darko is a very clever film and well worth a watch.",8,1,3,28 July 2006
Pocahontas," It has its songs, its attempted humour and its out of this world ideas but it fails to be anything too fantastic.
","Pocahontas was the first Disney film that I'd seen in quite a while and I had forgotten the enjoyment and magic that Disney films can often give you. Although I've probably seen most Disney films over the years, it was interesting to revisit this particular title after so long and view it with a more adult mind.One thing that you notice right away is that Pocahontas is not as epic as previous Disney films. There isn't a lot of animation and that cliché 'every effort is put into every drawing and thus; every frame' seems to have fallen through the net this time round. Because of this; the animation looks not only dated but it makes some of the characters (namely the lead heroine Pocahontas herself) 'kinda' funny lookin'.' That feeling that this is not as epic as previous instalments is also present. I don't know if Disney were going for the whole neo-realistic look or something since this is based on a true story (something Disney rarely do) but the actual drawings do fall a little flat. Hey, maybe they were putting all their animation effort into Toy Story from the same year; you never know.The film is clever and at the same time interesting at the start. We spend enough time with the sailors across their voyage and the protagonist is pretty obviously presented to us as John Smith since not only is he the one that saves a fellow sailor from drowning (Voiced by Christian Bale, no-less) but he's also voiced by Mel Gibson  more than enough evidence to suggest this is the leading man. Also, we get a peek at the native American's way of life which, unless you've studied pre-colonial America, is going to look pretty alien to you. This is the film giving us an even amount of time with either 'side' and is dangling a proverbial carrot in front of our faces, tempting us to make a link with either the sailors or the natives.The film is, overall, a very sophisticated story about friendship, trust and ultimately: love and the fact it's between two people from very different backgrounds and ways of life is all the more pleasurable. Even though it is a true story, Disney takes the material and makes good with it. What I didn't like though, was the fact that the animals whom are supposed to act as the films comic relief are actually more annoying than funny. I appreciate that it's 'just for kids' but where a proper love story is unfolding, two bumbling animals in the shape of Meeko (Pocahontas' racoon) and Percy (The English governor's dog whom he doesn't even realise is missing towards the end) attempt to ruin what it is that's going on around them. The fact they don't talk means that their actions have to make up for any amusing dialogue they might have had and when you have to rely on actions to make you laugh, you have to rely on slapstick and that really misses the mark in this film.The songs are impressive in their own right; like I said before, they're not as epic as previous films and consist of characters running through forests or boating down rivers with not much happening around them and with the same shades of colours and shapes used consistently. This is not like The Lion King (I Just Can't Wait to be King) or Aladdin (Never Had A Friend Like Me) where lots was going on and, arguably, better songs were presented to us. The willow tree was also something I had a bit of a problem with. Although acting as the mentor for Pocahontas, I felt that it broke too far from reality and wasn't even used that much anyway. I feel the film would've worked better had this character been a really elderly native American whom Pocahontas could've trusted but again, the prospect of a talking tree in a Disney film gets the kids in.Even if I was a little let down by the climatic battle scene since I didn't really 'feel' anything (when I felt I was supposed to have many emotions raging at once), the film sticks to its roots and has the ending that many of us probably wouldn't have liked to have happened. This is a strong Disney addition and shouldn't be overlooked.On a side note, if you liked this then check out 'A New World' (2005). It's another Pocahontas film and funnily enough, stars Christian Bale as well.",6,5,10,3 June 2007
Born on the Fourth of July," Enormously interesting tale of struggle; isolation; rejection and new found identity as a director burrows his way into the past exploring old wounds and new leases.
","Oliver Stone's 1989 depiction of the life of true-to-life figure Ron Kovic, right up to his first mass address to a watching audience on an array of topics, arrives in the form of Born on the Fourth of July and is a superb depiction of the man's life from childhood right the way through to what he's become by way of some grotty existences and harsh realities. The thrill is in Stone's pacing of the film, the rapidness and short lived childhood in New York before the branching out into a tour of Vietnam during the war and finally slowing the entire piece down as the injuries sustained on that tour take their physical and mental toll on our lead; a toll born out of a certain president's foreign policies and their encouragement of the youth of the day to engage in activities that'll, supposedly, make a difference. I suppose the film is a part of Stone's 'rage' cannon of the late 1980s, early 1990s which saw a flurry of films released little more than twelve months or so apart from one another that attacked all manner of things America stood for; the centre piece here resembling something like John F. Kennedy's speech of it not being a case of 'what your country can do for you', but something resembling vice-versa and the ill affects if that.Kovic was drawn into the world of the U.S. Marines by way of Kennedy's speech as well as a band of recruitment officers whom visited his school campus. Fittingly, by the time another former U.S. president has arrived onto our screens, it is in the form of Nixon and by this time, we feel Kovic has found his voice in amongst all the hardships after having Kennedy essentially lead him in. Kovic's childhood is constructed as this eerily picturesque existence which comes chock full of utopian iconography representing; the winning shot in a baseball match as parents watch on is balanced with a very American celebration of Americanism and patriotism in the form of Independence day marching complete with bands and the honouring of war heroes of past. His gaze is captured as he sits atop his father's shoulders looking on at these Second World War veterans, a degree of morbid fascination perhaps filling his mind as he watches the adulation these people receive but perhaps failing to spot both the results of war some of them sport. Additionally, a war game in the opening scene descends into chaos amongst kids creating a sensation that it certainly felt like a good idea at the time, but bickering and bad form take over. As Kovic's childhood moves into adolescence, the man develops into this odd conventional figure of blind patriotism combined with Christian values and the sort whom rushes to one's school ending prom, in the rain, just in time to have this perversely romanticised dance with a childhood sweetheart.Tom Cruise plays the role of Kovic from around this age and upward, his rough and ready look years on from his teenage years consisting of enlisting and so forth displaying a real sense of maturity in the man's acting at such an early age way back when. The innocence, or stupidity, of youth is captured when Kovic and his pals discuss military enrolment and confuse the action with links to masculinity, labelling being able to fight with other men and hold rifles as 'manly' things as the one voice whom rejects such a proposal belonging to Steve (Levine) talks of his wishes to stay behind and engage in activity of a more culinary nature, specifically: the running of a diner; actions perhaps more associated with the female of the species, if looking through the narrow slats possessed by the majority of these boys. Stone shoots most of these early exchanges colourfully and lovingly, sprinkling Kovic's life with the odd come-down in the form of a defeat to a rival school in a mat wrestling match after so much training and graft; foreshadowing the let down or frustration born out of believing in something so much to a point, with his post-Vietnam life resembling a greater extension of these thoughts and feelings.Our first look in at a kind of post Vietnam existence is a grimy and colourless Bronx set hospital for the veterans, a systematic look at how veterans of said war are both treated and how many of them struggle from the off in their dealing with this new found scenario. Twinned with this is the guilt Kovic himself carries with him following an accidental shooting of a friendly marine out in Vietnam in the aftermath of a firefight. Where Kovic finds solace in this new existence, after the establishing of how he must now lead his life following paralysis from the waist down, is political rallying and making things known to those ill-informed on events in the war. This is a result of a domestic disagreement with a family member as well as with Steve, who has since gone on to carve a decent enough life out of staying behind, like he said he would, to work at a diner. Stone directs the piece masterfully, changing gears in tempo and pace to suit the ease and toughness in which life travels by; shooting parts of Mexico the Vietnam veterans descend to in order to drown out life's newfound problems with this very warm, very welcoming feel; of which the segment begins with a deliberately appealing establishing shot of a good looking beach before we head on in and get more involved with what sordid activity is going on. A veteran of said war himself, and here emotionally bringing to life the experiences of another, Born on the Fourth of July is a weighty and involving film of impressive magnitude from Stone.",8,0,1,24 July 2010
The Social Network," One-part legal drama and one-part dialogue driven standoff; the film is an elegant picture, depicting some less than elegant people, which makes for engrossing viewing.
","Usually when characters have their faces illuminated, whilst shot in tight close up, from a light source located just below that of their chin, it is to bring about a certain ghoulish; uncanny; border-line evil sense to proceedings. There is a nightclub-set scene in David Fincher's The Social Network in which two male characters dominate the conversational proceedings between themselves, in doing so, shallow chit-chat with their write-off girlfriends, whom happened to be in the right place at the right time, plays out on occasion. Their faces, filling the frame, are periodically lit up by that of several shades of primary colours located beneath the glass of the tables at which they sit – the acute angle of their positioning causes great flourishes of light which are shed all over their facial features, but done so in a fashion rendering them somewhat frightening. The characters are, of course, shady and approaching despicable – even ghoulish; people about to make a lot of money off a world of young and vulnerable people living in a day and age in which modernity has gone mad; technological advancements are implemented unto us as 'must have' accessories, in spite of whether one requires them, and folk are exposed to computerised services allowing them to forge online identities which has, on occasion, led to what people have defined as a sickness.Welcome to the film about the person, or people, whom helped invent this item and their struggle to cash in on the riches that come with it. They call it Facebook; an online service allowing people to create their own web-pages of personal information, post recent happenings in life and put up all manner of content, complimentary or otherwise - that age-old idea of young people better off being seen and not heard has long since departed. The film is a near-perfect telling of a four-or-so month law suit which reared up over the winter of 2003 and briefly crossed over into 2004; an indelible balancing of several people on two sides of a particular fence in overall reference as to whom began the aforementioned website which took the online world by storm and as to how much in the way of riches either person is entitled to. It is remarkably written, beautifully played and wondrously directed; Fincher chopping back and forth from strand to strand, from equilibrium to equilibrium in the manner that tells us it is a director at the top of his game.For starters, the pleasure one derives from a film such as The Social Network bears little to the items simmering away at the core of it; one needs to know of Facebook, or indeed possess a Facebook account, in about as much-a capacity as one needs to know an awful lot about agricultural science in order to enjoy Tony Gilroy's 2007 film Michael Clayton: a good thriller is a good thriller, regardless of its subject matter. Jesse Eisenberg plays American Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, a talkative; frizzy haired kid in his early twenties with a room on campus and a tight circle of friends and girlfriends. Eisenberg nails the role with a steely glare and an affecting robot-like demeanour, delivering long passages of cutthroat speech in a cold and precise manner - he reminds us of another coldly blank antagonist, although only really an antagonist supporting proceedings in a world of ever-decaying social-strata, from Fincher's past work; that of Kevin Spacey's John Doe. In terms of framework, we liken him to Gyllenhaal's character from Fincher's 2007 film Zodiac - a lead whom happens upon a coded item, proceeds with it and then gets in deeper than he should have done.Zuckerberg, on account of being too frank and talkative with a girlfriend one night at a university bar, breaks up with her and lumbers back to his halls, alone, on a dreary Autumn evening. The glumness of his marital situation is encapsulated in the foreboding music motivating proceedings, but brief squirts of pleasant piano keys in amidst it reiterate the germ of a good idea trying to break through out of the scuzzy situation. His superiority, at least over other students of his age; ethnicity and sexuality, is enforced when, inter-cut with his devising of a social networking formulae, we observe numerous other students simultaneously drink; fool around and stand on coffee tables in their underwear - such are the things one gets up to at university.Andrew Garfield plays Eduardo Saverin, a friend and roommate but a later rival for the claim of the benefit payouts; two brothers, these fantastic physical specimens whom row and maintain their build like Zuckerberg is able to think along mathematical lines, are named Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, although are both played by Armie Hammer in an instance of flawless duel-acting on the man's behalf. The plot takes care of itself, suffice to say the film cuts back and forth to the ongoing battle over what amount should be paid to whom and how they all came to reach this situation. The film splices between either strand effortlessly, the reality of the fact we are aware of what the situation on the past strand will eventually lead to in no way detrimental to the overall intensity of the drama unfolding overall. The film's indelible manoeuvring of these characters around a chess board of sorts, as loyalties to one and then the other and differing factions are born out of events; what look like betrayals and distrust, is the real joy – the film a mesmerising drama rocketing Fincher away from the spasmodic, pseudo-teary The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and back to a recurring forefront of men wading through decrepit sociological surroundings; battling with themselves as well as the other men of distorted opposites they appear to have more in common with than would like, whom occupy that space with them.",8,0,1,29 September 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Refreshing and uplifting yarn which goes above and beyond what is expected of it; a fine effort that hits all the marks for which it aims.
","How often does a third entry to an American produced English language franchise, often worked to spin money irregardless of the critical consensus, sag and just generally disappoint? It is, in that case, a great credit to the team behind this, the third Indiana Jones film of 1989 entitled 'The Last Crusade', and the fact they done what they've done in creating something as fun and as refreshing as what we've got. We've all been here before, what with the then-latest hijinks preceded by something like four hours of romping; globe trotting; intermittent Nazi-thwarting period-set archaeological causality, but Spielberg doesn't just tread ground: he offers fresh character dynamics; addresses some rather personal issues that affect those caught up in the film's adventure and does his utmost to include action sequences that are every bit as exciting as what preceded them without ever necessarily mirroring them. Where other franchises have in the past faltered through repetition by this stage, Spielberg's film offers fresh wit and flair towards what is essentially the same theme park ride gone again.After the grim fatuity of 1984's Temple of Doom, The Last Crusade slots into a more carefree and relaxed approach to the 'Jones' material by initially harking back to the man's youth for the opening in a dusty 1912 Utah. In doing so, the messy and misjudged series of bleak horror-shows that was the second entry are somewhat banished and there is this sense of the franchise thus reverting back to all the fun and frolics imbued within that of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film makes a point to get across the tenaciousness and professionalism of Jones, covering the very first time the character happened upon the need for such characteristics with a delightful array of episodes set aboard a freight train hoarding varying circus acts. He looses a piece of treasure in '12, but gets it back again aboard a large ship on stormy waters in '38 - establishing his skills in combat in the process and how he doesn't necessarily let a loose end pass him by: he's willing to go to the ends of the Earth, it seems, if it means getting that 'just' cause settled.Back home in the American present, life as a university lecturer is draining and the students are demanding. He stands in his class room understating his profession, telling his class that the majority of the pastime is the reading of books and that romanticism has no place in the subject, citing that 'X never, ever marks the spot'. After a series of loosely connected events, Jones is bumped back onto the track spawning adventure and danger thus essentially allowing him to undertake a quest which will go some way to quell these negative emotions through which he expresses about his living. In wanting to get away from his students, there is an opportunity to rekindle that 'spark' and this lies with taking up the challenge to go after The Holy Grail, within which the blood of Chirst was captured as he lay there on the cross at his crucifixion: a goal outlined to him by American Walter Donovan (Glover). The decision teeters over from being a professional one to a personal one when it's revealed his father, Sean Connery's Henry, was swiped by some rivals gunning for the Grail given his credentials in the Grail's makeup and ancient history.Things begin in Venice where splashes of exposition and a good boat chase give way to some suspicions about who's on whose side when elegant German Elsa Schneider (Doody) pops up and seems very keen to guide Indiana through the initial mire. Around about this time, we're provided with a trademark series 'bit' involving rats and human-beings in a tight, centuries old underground place one cannot escape from. We've had bugs; spiders and snakes in the previous films: rats ought to do it this time. Charging across Europe to Austria, father Henry joins the quest and makes for what is probably the best sidekick so far; blowing the likes of the previous entry's Capshaw character and Short Round out of the water and probably topping Allen's from the first. Throughout, the Jones' aren't really on speaking terms and both Ford and Connery bounce off one another really well as these two scholars of archaeology acting as one another's foils: Henry being a man of a more refined and old fashioned sort therein the pastime but clashing head on with Indiana's serial-action hero approach to things.Fleeting substance between the two of them begins in the form of a brief moment on an airship when some truths from years ago rear up, and how Henry was seemingly more in love with his finding of the grail than of his own family. Spielberg's insistence on shooting Connery in the way that he does during the 1912 prologue goes some way to emphasise his anonymity in Indiana's life at that specific time; and without wanting to give anything away, the key denouement in their relationship happens much later on when Henry is forced into uttering the words 'let it go....' at a crucial time when the decision between putting family before what has since been revealed as a pipe dream plays out. The film is a winner, a franchise entry that sticks in the mind thanks largely to its central pairing; its humour; its action sequences and its off-piste scenes such as the one at a Nazi rally when a certain man's autograph is captured. In a sense, this is probably better than Raiders; the film cracks along at the same sort of pace but there just seems to be more stuff going on here with the capability of leaving a big grin on your face and not have you feel too bad about it. Where Spielberg has garnered praise in the past for his romping, B-movie inclined entertainments, he deserves a little more with this effort.",7,4,6,9 February 2012
Back to the Future," Still a fantastic example of comedy, horror and general fantastic family entertainment incorporating and promoting self-belief and courage.
","The opening shots of Back to the Future set up the film's ideas and general tone. We are treated to several inventions and gadgets and gizmos, within someone's kitchen and living area, designed to seamlessly ease into one another as the beginnings to a day are kick started. Maybe a television will come on; a robotic arm will pour dog foot into an already over stuffed bowl and toast will pop up when ready, but very burnt. The idea here is that this stuff can work, but to what negative effect? It's quite clear this area hasn't been occupied for a while and the dog food will surely leave a foul smell for when the owner returns but what's that compared to the fire hazards in both the TV and the toast? This is what the film will eventually branch out into; a piece about technology and inventions working but with what, potentially quite terrible, results.Back to the Future is one of those rare and special films that feel tilted more toward a younger audience and yet bear no harm in being revisited by others later on in years. The film can amuse and is able to sustain humour and interest, no matter how wacky the characters are or the predicament is. The film can frighten and additionally pay sly homage to history whilst it includes a fair few gags to how the protagonist's actions perhaps changed the course of history as we know, those being more directed toward the adult watching audience with Marty McFly's rendition of 'Johnny B. Goode' a great example. The film is a near masterpiece, bordering on greatness as it seamlessly entertains, humours, delivers a brilliant and inventive narrative whilst even feeling brave enough to touch on elements of a Freudian nature.Of Marty McFly, he is played by Michael J. Fox in what is a big-screen career defining role. The piece of brilliant technology that is used to a certain degree of negative effect is the time machine a certain Doctor Emmett Brown (Lloyd) built out of a DeLorean automobile. The film revolves around Marty using this invention to travel back to 1955, following an escape from some hostiles out for Emmett, and a consequential accidental changing of history equating in the danger of Marty himself quite possibly being scrubbed out of history.As a stand alone film, Back to the Future offers pretty perfect family entertainment. Its balance of fun and games mixed with a foreboding scenario, a scenario that lies at its very heart, is perfectly captured when McFly wanders down the Hill Valley street in 1955 following going back and witnessing how different his town was thirty years ago before the reality of the situation hits him in ominous fashion. Buried deep within Back to the Future might well be a statement on the condition of then contemporary America. Its two worlds of 1955 and 1985 exhibit the same facilities and general look, but offer very different outlooks on ways of living in the respective years. While porno theatres exist in the 80s, cinemas were playing the cream of Classical Hollywood back in the day; while shops and business' look shoddy, run down and some are even out of business in the modern age but they were clean and bristling with activity in the past.The film even pokes fun at mayoral promises, promising a bright outlook in the 1950s but we, as does the film's lead, know the truth of what becomes of the town. Without obviously pointing fingers, the film shares a joke with us to do with how remarkable it is that Ronald Reagan is the 1985 president. It enjoys telling us that Marty's home estate-to-be will be one of the 'best places to live' come development, but the harsh reality of it is that it's anything but. This is something the second film touches on more when the quality of living deteriorates even more when a powerful political figure (that would be this film's antagonist Biff) has a say in how the town is run, echoing Marty and Emmett's brief but poignant conversation to do with how unbelievable Emmett finds it that Ronald Reagen is the president in 1985.But while the film's political slant isn't its primary focus, you can't help but feel the film is a reference to how the author is very fond of the 1950s or the past in particular, something he sees to have been so much better than the present day. Marty's accidentally and ill advised attempts at changing history result in his teenage mother potentially falling in love with him, subject matter deemed too taboo for Disney and they rejected the film, but the ideas aren't played for sick laughs and the film doesn't linger on the actual notion as much as it does focus on Marty's reactions to all these realisations his would-be mother is having towards him. The 'park' scene in particular acts as an example as to how Marty feels about the situation with the overly dramatic facial expressions acting as an offbeat and drastic reaction to the predicament. It's additionally easy to forget that, by the end, his mother's attention turns more towards George, like history should be, highlighting what a vulnerable girl she is and how easily it is for this girl to fall for someone else at such a delicate time in her life.This factor deflects the idea of the mother falling too deeply in love with her own would-be son somewhat, as we realise how naive she really is to fall again so quickly. But the film is full of ideas and energy, arguably being the best of its 'type' at the time of release. Producers didn't think people would take to it due to its lack of 'risqué' but years later, it stands head and shoulders above all the other 'more risqué' teen films that were released at that time.",8,0,0,2 April 2009
Goodfellas," Broad and invigorating tale of organised crime and a general life of crime in the centre of last century.
","Goodfellas quite effortlessly embeds itself near the top of the tree in terms of both the best of the genre and the best of a certain director. That director is Martin Scorsese; a man whose films, it seems, reach out to generation after generation because of their timeless studies of the male who's placed within a scenario of either psychological crisis or social misfit; often both. Scorsese's films are journeys, but they never seem to branch out beyond the constraints of a city or the small, designated and rather run down area in which they're set. There are no vast landscapes or set pieces involving glitzy cinematography; just down and dirty locales inhabited by people you wouldn't usually notice or want to pay much attention to, only Scorsese brings them to life in that way that he does.Such is Goodfellas, an old fashioned yarn about the rise and consequent fall of a gangster who begins life at the bottom of the pecking order before working their way up and then realising that once you're in that groove you've been searching for, you become even more vulnerable than before. Goodfellas isn't the sort of film you revisit because you're tired of Scorsese's more recent efforts. From what I've seen following Goodfellas, he hasn't made a great film since his 1990 mob thriller but that's not to say any of his films since haven't been at least good to some degree.The film tiptoes along that fine line that makes organised crime or indeed Mafia life look 'cool', or 'sexy' or the sort of lifestyle you might want to get involved in. It's important to recognise that, by the end, Ray Liotta's Henry Hill has become the one thing he feared most before even starting out in 'the life' and that's a regular guy who lives in a suburban house, with a mailbox and a newspaper on the doorstep every morning. It sounds like he ended up pretty well off considering the amount of blood, violence and death that awaits rather a few of the other characters that inhabit Goodfellas, but that's not to say it's a brain dead blood bath designed to appeal to the masses. Each and every death; act of violence - Hell, even every gunshot resounds with the viewer in a chilling and quite frightening manner; whoever the victim and whoever the instigator. Some are more jarring than others, but we feel a certain something toward each individual that is involved in a grizzly end.Such is the power of the character study here. Henry Hill is young and on the brink of his teen years. He lives opposite a restaurant in Brooklyn, New York in the 1950s and doesn't look at but gazes at the activity that goes on down there on ground level as organised crime syndicates go about their business. The first time he sees blood or the results of acts of extreme violence is the first time we do, when one member stumbles back to the place of business in agony. Hill meets fellow Italian and Irish American alike gangsters in Jimmy Conway (De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Pesci), both based on real life people whom, I read, are as akin to their real life persona's as possible. What follows is a study of life, love, theft, murder and honour all within a Mafia orientated arena.Apart from most things, Goodfellas is a cracking ride. At two and a half hours, but never feeling like it, you have fly through the lives of these people in no time at all. Hill's voice-overs provide most of the toned down and grubby information required on how he lived as a child complete with violent father a truancy problems and when those switch to Karen (Bracco) and her, worried if anything perspective, it acts as a jolt to the audience as the mindset of a man in Henry who is slowly getting involved to the point in which he may assume himself invincible. Of course towards the end, he really does loose it as a cocaine deal and a large family meal clash on the same day in what is a sequence of events that work on several dramatic and humorous levels at once.I think the most resounding reason Goodfellas comes across as so good and so memorable is its strength in depth in regards to individual scenes or moments. Just thinking about certain sequences, such as the long take in which Henry makes his way across a public street and breaks someone's nose with a revolver or the scene in which the guys sit around Tommy's mother's table and talk and eat casually, despite the fact there's a dying man in Tommy's car which is parked outside, just produce chills. One of the more famous scenes is, of course, Tommy's 'Funny? Funny how?' tirade. Even when the film begins to remove us from the life of crime and more towards the older age that these characters approach, Scorsese does it in such a way that we're cool with the genre being manipulated and branching out into something else. Goodfellas is, and will continue to be, a very impressive and worthwhile film for many those who stumble across it.",8,0,0,5 March 2009
Hustle & Flow," Threatens to undo all its good work and morals about effort but remains a steady and interesting look at hope.
","Is Hustle and Flow about dreams? Most definitely. Does the film tell us that dreams can come true no matter what? No, it doesn't but what it does get across is the message that you should try to achieve them, no matter what happens or what situation you're in. This is the kind of lecture Hustle and Flow gets across in an engaging and realistic manner thanks to the final few scenes which border on tragedy at its very best when a certain someone who a certain someone else looks up to dismisses the dream in an instant after so much work. For a film to focus on someone whom most would consider part of the dregs of society; have them go through so much, but not in the way of neatly plotted narrative, and then to have the bubble threaten to burst is a brave move because it could so easily be misread as a message that no matter what, you will fail. But right nearer the end, the film bails itself out by having its protagonist placed in a position of power from which others will look up to him in the same manner he once looked up to others. This is a brave film that introduces Djay (Howard) as someone you wouldn't give five minutes of your time to before taking him on this journey and then having the audacity to hammer home the wrong ideation. Djay is an African-American living in Memphis but he represents any living being who feels as if they're stuck in a rut without having found their 'form' or their calling. Like most African-Americans in Hollywood films, he is a pimp with few redeeming qualities. But the surprise here is the manner in which Hustle and Flow grabs this protagonist after a relatively low-key; urban cause and effect fuelled opening and has them suffer an epiphany so early on with two incidences opening his mind: that being the acquiring of an old electronic keyboard and the chance encounter with Key (Anderson), an old school buddy.The fact Djay specifically mentions his childhood when toying with the mock keyboard is one thing but the further emphasis on Key's character as a friend from school and the fact he is now in the music producing industry are two things that I feel call Djay into the world of music  they push him over the line if he was not already on the brink, albeit he perhaps did not know he was. The film at its core is about how one man can venture outside of the boundaries he knows like the back of his hand. Djay is a pimp and while he is not happy in that role, it is a role he seems accustomed to. His trading and dealing within his profession sees him sit in a car and talk every so often to customers perhaps interested in the girl he sits beside  it is simplistic and Djay is in a groove but the film follows a 'promotion' of sorts when he is elevated into the world of music. But the film covers the dangers of venturing outside this groove if anything else and the study is quite brilliant.It is not only Djay that the film touches on when it comes to characters being out of the boundaries of comfort. The film tells us the basic message that in order to achieve, do not keep yourself in the passage you're currently in and this counts for Djay but Key's scenario of already having a seemingly 'perfect' life is equally interesting. As a character, Key has elevated himself above Djay's prior position and has a nice house compared to Djay's dwelling; a loyal wife whom we elevate above Djay's girls thanks to the scene in her living room in which they sit in opposing positions, the simplest of compliments breaking out into an argument between Djay's two representatives and he also has a living in the music business which we put in stark contrast to Djay as a pimp. As the friendship rekindled wears on, Key will be tested in his patience and so will his relationship with his wife who is most concerned about the time he spends at the house with so many of the loose women she has recently had prior contact with. But as the film develops through its musically driven narrative complete with Oscar winning 'It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp' which in itself is about the rut and prior groove Djay found himself in, it becomes apparent that the hero of the hour is eyeing up a bigger prize and that is a rendez-vous with now legendary rapper Skinny Black (Ludacris). For the final third to be so involved and so decisive with the climax of this dream is quite extraordinary. The feeling of all or nothing is really put across in an impressive manner during this particular passage and the 'certain failure' which partly comes with this sort of story is somewhat harrowing in the sense that not only does it seem Djay might fail but the film may seem as if it will put across the wrong message completely. But the film is not that nasty and isn't about to undo all its hard work. A grittier and more hard hitting ending might well have worked against the film more than anything but for what it is, Hustle and Flow is an interesting and satisfying film which will give a sense of feeling and one of brooding atmosphere as it steers its way towards a dramatic climax.",7,1,2,30 July 2008
Jurassic Park," Not without a certain flair, and certainly a lot more than mindless creature-feature thrills, Jurassic Park is quite the involving little adventure film.
","Jurassic Park is Spielberg theme park hijinks unfolding in that of a theme park; his film a cut and thrust escapade through varying B-movie traits, tracts and ideas totalling up into an experience akin to that of romping through an array of 'themed' locales within a park proper. By the time one has had a go on the dodgems and the ghost train, one has been there long enough and built up enough verve for the huge trademark roller-coaster ride; after that experience, we bring ourselves back down with a shooting range or some spinning tea-cups. There are some terrific scenes of terror, chase and thrills in Jurassic Park that essentially act as the park's 'leaner, meaner' rides, and they are dotted around some other sequences that effectively act as a prelude to those 'leaner, meaner' rides – the fun of the fair before we're strapped in proper for the big one.There is one instance, at a heightened moment of distress, in which a character must sprint for her life toward a small building located out in the dinosaur infested jungle. In running for the door, Spielberg shoots her jog from an Evil Dead-inspired low angle alluding to something small and monstrous being right there and then on her heels. Of course, there isn't actually anything there and the angle rings false in this sense; the sequence, like most theme park rides, runs on prolonged adrenaline built out of the thrills and spills on offer: the placing of one in a predicament of peril and fear that is out of the ordinary, but without with the intense risk of injury or death, thats' somehow pleasurable for the onlooker, even if it perhaps shouldn't be.Spielberg will begin the film in the mould of his 1975 monster-movie Jaws; here, rather than focus on a teen-aged girl mangled to death by an unseen beast, we observe a middle-aged employee caught up in a botched operation by a creature the film's poster, like Jaws, tells us is a dinosaur. It is arguably more striking here, everything is organised and not as spontaneous as it was in Jaws; there are several professional-looking personnel armed and trained to deal with something which still gets the better of them. The death brings about a law-suit from the family of the deceased, lawyer Donald Gennaro (Ferrero) arrives at an amber mine owned by the employer of the deceased, whom it's established cannot turn up for such a sombre occasion out of business, such is his nature. By way of his dress, Gennaro looks out of sorts where he is and struggles to negate the terrain; alluding to a wider extent of being unable to deal with what he's getting into. Things develop and the owner, a certain John Hammond (Attenborough) whose wealth might exceed that of anyone else's in movie history, enlists three experts in archaeological doctors Grant (Neill) and Sadler (Dern), as well as doctor of mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), to tour certain facilities before they go public so as to give it a proverbial 'nod'.Those facilities form the titular Jurassic Park, a place in which dinosaurs come to life and strut around like zoo creatures as the paying customers gawk on; a bit different to that of travelling to Finkley Down Farm, a family spot located in the South of England, where your biggest risk was having the crude paper bag of 'feed' you were given snatched from your very hands if you took your eye off the goats. Spielberg has fun with his monsters and his sequences of peril, but deserves credit for not rendering the presence of his humans as not much more than action figures in a children's fantasy game. Sadler and Grant are in a relationship, their archaeological digs are crude but sweetly old fashioned; they drink champagne, but only on the special occasions. Grant cannot fathom modern technology, but through the wonder of Hammond's innovations, he will come to face his fears of what it is he studies brought to life via technology, as well as doing well to banish his dislike of children. There is some fun to be had out of his rapport with Malcolm, who's 'always looking out for the next ex-Mrs. Malcolm'; his eyes are on Sadler, he loves children and she wants some – when he tries to explain Chaos theory to her, we wonder if it is a genuine discussion or whether it's a bogus exercise that provides him with an opportunity to flirt and stroke her wrist.There is great energy and craft in most of what constitutes antagonism with the dinosaurs, let loose by a fun sub-plot to do with a corrupt employee looking to steal DNA. The rendez-vous with the T-Rex, as it breaks out of his paddock with everyone beside it, is a superb exercise in sound and fear; the audience allowing a good look at the automobiles the characters travel in prior to departure via a long tracking shot capturing the pristine nature of the things and their advanced touch-screen technology and roomy qualities: later reduced to that of the equivalent of a T-Rex chewy-toy as the beasties run amok. There is talk of the Rex prior to this engagement as a threat; its skeleton in the main entrance brings us aware of its size, a similar trait Spielberg implements unto that of the Velociraptor, whose methods are verbally reiterated by Grant early on and whose claw Grant carries around with him as a novelty charm shows us their weapon. From its character driven beginnings to its calm; peaceful and exhausted ride home akin to that of the driving back from a theme park experience with the kids, Jurassic Park combines meaty thrills with enjoyable film-making substance capitalising on some wondrous special effects for the time and studious direction from a man capable of delivering on as many fronts as possible.",7,0,1,9 August 2011
Valkyrie," Respectable and rather tense Second World War thriller which manifests suspense and danger around a group of men looking to make a grandeur change.
","The camera slowly, tantalisingly zooms in on a spinning record whilst bombs are falling all around the building the contraption is in; our lead and his family helplessly cowering in a basement as the loud and proud emoting of Wagner's 'The Ride of the Valkyries' booms out of the gramophone when the rumble from another explosion pushes the needle back onto the track. It's an important sequence, the scene in which whilst down there in that basement taking cover from the very bombs designed to injury him as he figures out a way to aid those they belong to, our lead hits upon the idea of enforcing an operation; a plan that might bring about the ending of World War Two, thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives, but at the risk of his own. It's a powerful moment, one that gives our lead an idea, impetus and strength within an individual happening designed to maim and destroy. Such is the nature of the lead, showing strength through adversity; like all of those that were members of whichever resistance movement in whatever nation at that time.And from whence the thriller Valkyrie gets its name is revealed, a 2009 Bryan Singer film about the true story revolving around a certain man named Claus von Stauffenberg, a German colonel in the upper throngs of the Nazi party during World War Two, who took it upon himself to wipe out Adolf Hitler in a bid to have the German political hierarchy thrust into chaos as The War chugged into a fifth year. The film sees Singer return to material of a Nazi orientated nature for the first time since 1998's Apt Pupil, another rather terrifying drama, that time about a young boy becoming gradually more and more obsessed with a specific text in The Holocaust as themes of blackmail and the exploiting of power one supposedly possesses over another person, the likes of which the young boy had been reading of, became more frighteningly apparent.In Valkyrie, another look at the dangers or misuse of power is observed; the determination of Tom Cruise's von Stauffenberg in achieving what it is he wants so dear by way of knowing he can be in such close proximity to an individual of such infamous nature is played out, an advantage he utilises so as to put a plan of action into motion. Others are connected, a flurry of British actors curiously both hovering and revolving around American Cruise's whim, all of whom playing true to life German officials that want an end to the madness and murder as Hitler prolongs the deaths of the innocent and those serving on the various fronts of The War. They know the risks; they know their mission and they're aware of what it'll take of them when the scene in a church sees von Stauffenberg talk to Bill Nighy's general, a certain Friedrich Olbricht, for the first time about the idea of trying to initiate operation Valkyrie plus ideas about how setting out in eliminating a man is still a mere act of murder. Indeed, later on Olbricht observes that while they're doing their best to save lives and end suffering: 'only God can judge us'; the theological elements of following through with this mission made aware.Cruise's von Stauffenberg is a battle scarred man, weary of the war and an individual with experience of the front line when an attack on his desert troops in Tunisia by an American Flying Tiger fighter plane leaves him without a right hand and a left eye. His wife is Nina (van Houten), her and their children those whose lives we feel are in greatest danger when he is away and indulging in his plans; here Singer using the innocent lives of von Stauffenberg's family to act as representatives for those of the greater nature of who'll be saved if the plan succeeds. One scene sees von Stauffenberg attempt to call home by way of the telephone, but recent bombing has made communication difficult as von Stauffenberg's situation becomes increasingly precarious. He places the phone down and it hangs ominously on the receiver, teetering as if on a cliff edge; rocking back and forth as a photograph of his family stare back at us with the phone in the foreground: the outcome of their situation remains unanswered and certain fates of the von Stauffenberg family remain in the balance as the phone continues to rock as if to dramatically become unhooked at any moment.The film covers his gradual infiltration of Hitler's Nazi party higher members, and his consequent invitation to the heavily fortified Wolf's Lair, located deep in rural Germany, in which the strike will eventually occur; an idea met with some disdain from certain people early on, particularly Tom Wilkinson's Friedrich Fromm, when Singer applies a number of profile shots of men facing each other in a showing of anger, disagreement and confrontation. His direction is taut and punchy, taking a true story of which few will have heard of but mostly all will know the result of within seconds of it being detailed, the film's expositional tidbits from fully grown men explaining plans and complicated political procedures and agendas to one another harmlessly inter-cutting with the pot-boiling and execution of this plan to leave an awry suitcase in a dangerous place. The key to the drama is not knowing the outcome of von Stauffenberg and several of his cohorts, nor how it was they went about dealing with the situations they created. Singer's treatment of the material in that punchy, rapid fashion renders it accessible for more mainstream audiences without ever really degrading it or exploiting it for cheap entertainment's worth. The film is a tight and focused effort, involving in its own right and efficient in retelling a story of failure that needs not be forgotten.",7,0,0,31 May 2010
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpsons: Bigger, Longer and unbelievably: Uncut!
","So here it is then; The Simpsons finally do a film. I've been a big fan for years and years; frequently watching repeats on television of old episodes I know inside out yet haven't seen for ages. Usually, I don't watch animated films beyond Disney although the South Park film (1999) was a refreshing alternative. It took the makers of South Park a mere two years to adapt their characters into a film, something that took everything great about the series but moved up a level in the fact it didn't censor out any swearing, profanity or violence. Bearing everything else in mind, how does the Simpson's film shape up? Pretty damn good, on the whole.You get the feeling that the creators are trying to grow the series up a little bit  South Park and Japanese animation as a whole helped move that tag 'cartoons are for kids' away from animation and The Simpsons are also following suit as there are several things in this you'd never get in an episode on TV. These would include but probably aren't limited to: nudity, drug taking and swearing using hand gestures; Marge even refers to Lisa as a 'woman' about a fifth of the way through.Along with this, the film manages to capture what actually made the series so great and adapt it in a friendly and satisfactory way; there is no plot to start out with (in fact there is no real plot come the end) and thus it plays out like 'just another day in Springfield' as Homer carries out his chores, Lisa goes from door to door telling people about the environment and Bart gets involved in a game of 'truth or dare'. In all honesty, the opening twenty minutes was brilliant  laugh after laugh to any Simpsons fan who has been following the show for the duration I have as the film covers an array of characters and deals with a string of funny situations. Certain people who have certain favourite characters will be disappointed theirs didn't get enough screen time but from memory; Chief Wiggum, Cletus and Ned Flanders get the bulk of the screen time. This is not to be frowned at though as pretty much every character gets at least one joke to themselves, Moe's being particularly funny.When it comes to the famous family themselves, Maggie seems to get more screen time than Lisa which although sounds rather daft is actually genius as Maggie can't speak and thus, has to rely on her actions to act as the comedy which she does to very good effect. Lisa's time is more dedicated to a romance story which I will not spoil.The film gets going through an extremely unfortunate event that only really highlights Homer's stupidity and lack of thinking, thus making him look more like a buffoon than anything else; but once this happens you can feel it going down an extremely alternate route to that of the cartoon series. For reasons I shall not say, the rest of Springfield's characters are merely tossed aside meaning the bulk consists of The Simpsons so prepare yourself for that. This is a shame as with so many colourful characters to work with, dismissing them seemed rather ruthless but it is 'The Simpsons Movie' after all, not 'Springfield: The Movie'.Like I mentioned, the plot as a whole is weak and numerous little occurrences merely kick-start the film once again after it hits a groove it could so easily fall into and stay in. This includes but again, is not limited to Marge discovering something on the news about Springfield resulting in them having to travel back once they bed down in Alaska; something that didn't really seem to contain anything of note plot wise. Also, the humour once in Alaska is limited to things like avalanches, Bart taking up drinking and spoofs of Disney characters from films made 60 years ago.Once the film beds into its final third, the familiar Hollywood routine kicks in but I think the makers only wanted to finish on a strong, positive note and what better way to do so than using the familiar 'Happy, Hollywood ending'. This isn't a criticism but it does leave you with an odd feeling in the pit of your stomach  maybe it's just the fact that The Simpsons are actually in a film and are thus able to even HAVE a happy, Hollywood ending. It's difficult to say too many bad things about something I love so dear (The TV series) but despite really trying to love it (maybe too much), the film was only so much as a funny, big screen outing for the family of five that are: The Simpsons.",7,1,5,26 July 2007
The Fighter," Some of the more fascinating clashes in this boxing movie unfold outside of the ring, in what is a workmanlike and wholly functional relationship/sporting drama.
","I think when the titular lead in the Coen brothers' 1991 film Barton Fink was repeatedly asked to pen a 'wrestling movie', this is the sort of film that rich; mansion owning; pool-side dwelling studio executive was asking him to write. The Fighter has just about everything along those lines, the sort of film that builds to a 'big fight'; follows a plucky underdog who comes good; that has a delicate romance sewn up in amidst proceedings and enjoys its scenes in which volatile friends and family members bicker and clash with our lead over his decisions as he finally gets the chance to get along by himself in life. Unlike our old friend Fink, the makers of The Fighter are not stifled by the material, nor do they struggle with inserting real drive into proceedings. In fact, they tear into all of the frameworks; genre demands and character arcs with such aplomb, that it's difficult not to offer a meek smile and a brief internal cheer when a certain latter-part of the film fight has just ended and the result is what it is, despite knowing that the sorts of people we're rooting on are what they are on account of spending the last hour and a half with them.The lead is Mark Wahlberg's Mickey Ward, the little brother to a rather renowned Irish-American boxer named Dicky, played by Christian Bale, operating out of the American city of Lowell, in Massachusetts. A part time road sweep who boxes a little himself, Mickey lives in the shadow of his elder brother whose record is admirable and whose real claim to fame was that he knocked down a certain 'Sugar' Ray Leonard in a particular fight before going on to lose – a sort of 'Henry Cooper knocking down Cassius Clay' moment wherein people think of the actual result second to a specific moment in the contest. Dicky and Mickey occupy the frame together when we first see them, an odd moment in which a real-life 1990s made for TV documentary about drug addiction is being brought to life, fictitiously, with Bale and Wahlberg filling in for their counterparts. Dicky is the talkative one, a man who usually need only saunter down a street in the general area to be recognised and congratulated by the locals; Mickey cannot get a word in, but is talked up as the 'next big thing' in boxing.The fight against Leonard is a big deal to these people; if there is anything at all they can remember in-between their crack habits and low-level criminal activity, then it is how to speak the English language; what it is their names are and that moment in 1976 when Dicky took a swing in front of a packed Boston crowd only to floor the rather more famous 'Sugar' Ray. When the pair of them bump into one another at a boxing match some time later, we observe the respective entourages either men possess; Dicky speaks as if Leonard were on a similar wavelength to that of him anyway, as if Leonard has been brooding and revelling in such a moment from however many number of years ago similarly to how Dicky has been all this time. It isn't long before we're zeroing in on Mickey, though; at a bar late at night wherein leering and laughing and joking in that loud and obnoxious manner that's often apparent in dives such as the one depicted, we observe Mickey's physical distancing from the crowds and his more gentlemanly approach to the bar girl, Amy Adams' Charlene, when all that preceded it was filth.Around this distinction unfolds a part of Mickey's own boxing career; his relationship with Charlene and the class war with his half a dozen sisters-plus-volatile mother which is instigated as a result of this. First and foremost, the film is about someone veering away from foundations which only appear sturdy and into realms that are new and somewhat frightening but are independent and will be successful with hard graft. The scenes Mickey spends with Charlene are fun and feel different, her practising of an old hobby-come-sport of her own in high jumping whilst outside in a leisurely manner in stark contrast to the flesh and blood in Dicky attempting to scam bystanders into providing him with cash to feed his own drug habit. In moving away from the parental ties Mickey has, and away from the drug-problem riddled brother, we sense the author's message in depicting Mickey's success story away from these things.The film is executed in an engaging fashion, in spite of its relatively formulaic foundations; the director, a certain David O. Russell, keeps everything moving in the brisk manner he did with his Kelly's Heroes simulacrum in 1999's Three Kings, whilst providing us with a film so apt in journeyman-like qualities that the only real criticisms are limited to it being culpable to accusations of formula. Away from the training montages, of which are a beat from the overture ringing out during Rocky II's training montage away from self-parody, and away from the frantic searches for the likes of new sponsors and trainers when Dicky falls foul of the law, the film possesses some fantastic acting performances depicting pent up people in a hostile place continually expressing themselves, and is an involving drama which is easy to sneer at but difficult not to get wrapped up in.",7,0,0,8 December 2011
Atonement," A Contemporary twist film that uses romance as its drive before hitting us with the tragedy.
","Such a film like Atonement is one that sneaks up on you; it builds and builds seemingly going nowhere or not doing anything to suggest anything fantastic before hitting you with a contemporary twist. It's a film that makes you think; thus already elevating itself above a certain level of quality, there have been films that have used this little tactic in recent years that have spawned both great hate and admiration; films like: The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and even The Village. The films hit you with a series of scenes that although seem disjointed and random, all make sense when the apparent 'twist' makes itself known.After the film had ended; it got me thinking, which is a good sign. 'What does Atonement actually mean?' I thought to myself and that's when the penny dropped. Such audacity to have a major clue in the films title hinting at the possible results that will happen following the events that occur in the film's first plot point. If that sounds complicated then good, because clever films are complicated. Following Atonement's finale, I think two thirds of what I was going to say about the film were rendered either incorrect or useless; such is its nature that it relies on twisty, bendy and fate driven incidences to get across both its story and tragedy. I was sceptical for the best part of this film, noticing a lot of frustrations and rather a few incidences of inconsistency.Firstly, I did not buy how Briony (played by three different actresses) put two and two together regarding the incident at the fountain and how she would perceive it to be anything sexual; secondly, I find it amazing how even in the 1930s it would seem a thirteen year old girl would be able to identify the 'worst word of them all.' Granted, the third occurrence of a sexual nature that happens in the library Briony observes is the most blatant but I feel if she'd spied them kissing previously or whatever instead of the incident at the fountain that had nothing to do with anything sexual, it would've made for a better build up. To sum up; I fail to see how a thirteen year old girl can honestly 'see' sexual discrimination between two people who are standing at a fountain talking; before one of them has to take their top off so that they can get into the fountain to retrieve something. But these events lead to the bigger picture because when she finds them in the library, things really screw up her psyche.This is where the film's reoccurring theme of luck/chance comes in; if their hadn't been a wasp in the room, Briony wouldn't have gone to the window; if Robbie (McAvoy) hadn't sent the wrong note like he so stupidly does, everything would've been fine; if Robbie and Cecilia (Knightley) had spoken to Briony after she caught them in the library perhaps explaining what was happening and how everything would be alright, Briony wouldn't have felt as bad as she did. Little inconsistencies like this do bug me in films where the logical thing to do is substituted for sake of a story. But the initial incident also has a lot of inconsistencies; such as the fact Briony sees another example of love and/or sexual relations in the form of forced said events; in such quick proximity to one another in a certain time frame. The attacker is also stupid enough to recognise the witness that is Briony and run off without confronting her. I remember feeling that the attacker must not have known Briony otherwise they would've hung around to explain their actions  turned out they did know Briony but ran off anyway  how could they assume she didn't see their face? Following said events, Robbie finds himself in France just before the Nazi invasion and the event that was the Dunkirk evacuation which is brilliantly captured in one, long take. Running parallel with this is Briony's life as a nurse in London, treating the injured. Here, I wondered why we were following Briony and this where the film makes you think it's flailing and flailing but really it's playing you because it's doing everything right. True, Briony would have no idea what's happening to Robbie in France but we are shown it anyway; instead, Cecilia is ignored only until she is visited by Briony  an event that I was tearing my hair out over when questioning the character's sanity and ability to let it all go: Robbie gives her an earful because of her action. But where I thought Atonement was going through the numbers of trying to make its apparent hero make up for past mistakes; suffer an epiphany; yadder, yadder yadder.........but no, it was playing me.It may sound like I am bashing Atonement but it does the business in the end. Getting there is a little messy but the story is very smart with a real feeling of: 'what if said event hadn't happened' and the closing montage of the fates of people is stirring because you don't see it coming; you have been led to believe one thing and then had what you thought turned on its head. There is enough authenticity and beauty to be had in the photography and costume with an air of tragedy and regret flowing throughout as the film switches perspectives in a confusing but rewarding manner.",8,2,3,11 January 2008
V for Vendetta," P for Pathetic
","Comical, overblown, poorly written and a delicate subject given the 'Hollywood treatment'; all of these can be used to describe 'V for Vendetta'. The film kicks off far too early with the evilness surrounding the state thrown at our faces in a very sudden fashion. We aren't given any build up to Portman's character, nor to that of 'V' and as a result, it takes a lot longer for us to 'get to know' them as the film goes on. This twinned with the fact that when we should have been properly introduced, we're given a brief and rather ugly introduction to Guy Fawkes and the history surrounding him, obviously one for the Americans as anyone who has been to a November the 5th BBQ or fireworks party really doesn't need this sort of beginning, in fact the film would've benefited from more of a build up involving the corruption in the state and the past trauma's surrounding the main characters. As a result, we see this later on in the film  at the wrong time, emphasising the evidence that the film was written badly.The initial incident of V and Evey meeting each other happens far too early on and the relationship between them dies a quick death between them meeting for the first and second times. The gap is just far too long. This is very disorientating as from then on, they are inseparable. Another example of the poor writing is where a 'mock' television programme episode is created by one of the characters. Clearly a suicidal act within the film world and a huge question mark is raised as to how much the writers really 'knew' their characters. 'Would he have really done that?' From this act of the mock TV programme being shown, the film twists down another road as this stupid, suicidal act propels the film forward and spawns a few extra events. I'm not giving too much away but there's a death, a kidnapping and a mini-twist within the narrative, all creating the ILLUSION of good film making and although it's directed well, the fact is that it should never have happened in the first place(!) The writers clearly ran out of ideas and realised the dead end they were heading down before coming up with this narrative revelation.Another flaw in the writing is the dialogue. This is a very American film and was clearly written by the Americans, FOR the Americans. The script is clearly lacking in research as the British stereo-types flow out of here like water out of a power shower: thick and fast. Another thing is that English people don't say 'bollocks' in every other sentence when faced with an awkward/life threatening situation, they swear like every other person in the world and if you're writing for a 12-17 year old audience whilst at the same time keeping in the violence shown towards the end and of course, the element of terrorism which is obviously present then shame on you for not getting your priorities right. Yet again, an example of terrible writing and not any where near to what I expected from the Wachowski Brothers. The laughable monologue at the beginning of the film which used as many words as possible that begin with the letter 'V' was ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It was an obvious hint to what was to come.I think the people who REALLY like this film are suffering, in some way, from some sort of brain washing. I think they've realised the Wachowski Brothers are involved, they've realised it's a comic book outing, which most people enjoy given success of films like Underworld, X-Men and Spider Man in recent years, they've realised that it's got a big cast and they've realised it's dealing with current affairs in the form of terrorism. Everything seems so perfect, when really it's very far from it.What has happened here is the makers have cleverly set it away from America and in the pretty distant future, thus thinking that they have a bit of a license to overcook certain things and audiences have lapped up the fantasy. Little annoying things such as the fact V's face has the same expression on it over and over due to the mask he wears. This makes it very difficult to relate to the main character as we never even see him and I found it very difficult to motivate myself to even care for him. The poor casting of Stephen Fry, who emphasised the stereo typing with the accent and attitude of his character and the annoying invincibility that V seemed to have throughout the film. Things like this drag the film further down.This wasn't spectacular in the cinema and will look even worse when it comes to the small screen.One last thing is that 'Remember, remember the 5th of November' has got to be one of THE most annoying taglines in film history.",5,5,10,4 April 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Coen Brothers, Where Art the real Thou?
","The Coen Brother's 2000 film 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is too much of too many slightly to reasonably good ideas patched up and sprayed all over the screen at once. The film will cover so much ground in terms of the flicking between genres; grounded content; off-the-wall content and tacked on character development that it just all fuses together and comes away somewhat of a mess. With hindsight, we can all say that films like O Brother, Where Art Thou? represent one of two different sorts of films the Coen's have in them; some of their best pieces of work are restrained, looming, ominous and quite grim. However, they have this tendency to throw these sorts ingredients out the window from time to time, and just come up with 'stuff' (and I do mean 'stuff', in inverted commas) that's wacky; carefree; loud; trying too hard to be funny and just generally obnoxious.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is one of those films; a film that'll shoot all over the place with absolutely no shame whatsoever, encompassing musical numbers; bank heists; a general sense of chase as they run from authorities as well as an electoral campaign running on a separate equilibrium. Between the film beginning and ending, some pretty far reaching material will have unfolded within a pretty small proximity of area. The unfortunate thing is that we're never given a chance to take any of it in and we're never given much of a chance to pause and reflect. The film is in so much of a hurry to shift onto the next 'funny' or 'quirky' encounter with the next misfit that none of film's character's encounter hold any sort of dramatic weight, and thus, do not add up to anything. A little of O Brother, Where Art Thou?'s approach goes a long way.On paper, the film should've worked a lot better than it did: a Coen Brothers film about three escaped convicts in 1930s deep south America running from the law in the hope to un-earth some self proclaimed 'treasure' hidden out there somewhere, only one prisoner of whom knows its whereabouts. The additional catch is that they only have a few days to find it because where it's buried will be flooded shortly. Yes, Yes, Yes - hand me that premise in the hands of these two guys and I'd lap it up anytime, any-day. But somewhat annoyingly, what we get is a hodge-podge of a piece, a stumbling and fumbling picture attempting to create comedy out of a young man's simplistic mindset; a film that uncomfortably straddles the line between realism and escapism with its all-too coincidental chance encounters and general outrageous content blended in with its sharp attention to the three guys throughout as they need to change clothes, find food, garner money, discover places they can safely rest and be able to maintain a consistent speed of travel in whatever capacity.The three men out and on the run are Tim Blake Nelson's Delmer; John Turturro's Pete and another individual named Everett (Clooney), whose authoritarian presence dwarfs the other two somewhat by being the one claiming to know where the loot from a raided armoured van is hidden. Their road-movie inspired journey is introduced somewhat obviously, and somewhat crudely, by a camera shot which begins on ground level by a railway track before shamelessly craning upwards to encompass a the rest of the single railway track going off into the distance, thus informing us of the singular line voyage these leads will go on. This occurs mere seconds after some kind of prophetic blind man lays out the long and spiritual journey the characters are to go on from here. It's all very self-aware, all-very post-modern and all very silly.But what of the journey? For a film to adopt that singular line strand narrative arc, what happens certainly unfolds in the crudest and elementary of fashions. I don't think there's much sense that these characters have progressed an awful lot from the point their journey begins to the point the film rounds everything off. The Coen's play a couple of wild-cards to create the illusion that the characters do so, one of which occurs very early on when a local Christian congregation are baptising people in a river and two of the stow-away prisoners take up the chance to supposedly rid themselves of sin. But this is a stark and jarring occurrence that takes the character from one extreme item to another; the film's in a rush, and rather than allow these guys to bond and figure things out for themselves in terms of who they are and what they ought to be doing in life, one scene very early on prematurely thrusts certain leads from criminal/ex-prisoner to apparently reformed citizen.A lot of the quest can unfold in any order it likes; there's no flow or consistency to any of these guy's mis-adventures. An encounter with some sirens; a coming across a one-eyed conman; interactions with a bank robber; some altercations with the police â€“ it's all loud, garbled nonsense and can unfold in any order you want it to while I found some of these wacky and outrageous encounters further pull me away from the focus of the leads and their supposed goal of finding the loot. Twinned with this is a somewhat disturbing overtone of gun-play, or gunfire made funny. Early on, a shotgun wielding kid will provoke a would-be humorous encounter with the criminals trying to get back on their feet; bank-robber Nelson's (Badalucco) eccentric attitude as he fires off Tommy Gun rounds I'm sure spawns a few laughs amongst others, while the exploding ammunition in the police truck probably does the same thing. But by the time a certain rug has been pulled from underneath us linked to the premise, and we've had a series of country and western warblings; I think we're just about ready for 'O Brother' to end.",5,0,1,15 November 2009
The Godfather," It's still as fresh and still as enthralling even now.
","Such is the outlandishness and exuberance of The Godfather, that it is able to branch one of its more lower key characters off onto a tangent that is detached from the primary narrative strand based in New York, in the 1950s and sees the film revolve around the Corleone Family; and have this character shifted to the Italian island of Sicily as he lays low; meets new people and ultimately feels raw human emotion. He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century.Michael is, of course, laying low because of the organised hit on certain individuals he put himself up to back in New York. I think up to that point, Michael had been a character involved, but not in a particularly spectacular manner, in the film but that consequent event and 'hiding' embeds him into 'the life'; it is his own point of no return that captures the essence of loyalty to one's family when the chance arises to show your worth, but at the same time acts as a demonstration of how easily it is for these people to, despite telling most involved that they're 'straight', get involved in the nastier side of life that others close to them are ultimately involved in.The series' sprawling, but in a good sense, study of life in crime several decades ago begins with 1972's The Godfather and at the rather distinct locale of a wedding, perhaps signifying what all weddings should signify: a beginning, a new beginning as the long and unknown road lies ahead  there will be good times, great times but bad times as we advance into the supposed unknown. Such is a synopsis of either Mafia life and the healthy-one-minute-dead-the-next ideation of life in organised crime as well as life following marriage as you venture off into the next chapter with 'the one' at your side. The scenic and pleasant setting of the wedding sees the film immediately establish a juxtaposition of the pleasant; of the upbeat and of the enjoyable clashing with the fact behind closed doors, despite the occasion, gangsters lurk discussing sordid prior activity and acts of brutal retribution in light of these acts.Initially, I think we're supposed to assume the film is about the very man sitting in his office; listening to stories delivered by people who do not (cannot) demand, but crave, action. The Don, Vito Corleone (Brando), sits and listens to whether the situation demands attention. Eventually he deems the immediate opening tale worthy of such Mob retaliation but for a favour in the future. There is a certain nonchalance, an establishing of power in these first scenes, that being before it branches out into the wedding and then into life amongst the Corleone family itself. Additionally, it is said that Vito has contacts in the music industry while a certain humane side to Vito is brought through via the fact it's established he brought into the family an orphan off of the street.But while Vito is the most powerful and the most inspirational character in the film, it isn't necessarily about him. Indeed, early on his adopted son Tom Hagen (Duvall) is engaging with others more than most others, a right hand-man for Vito and a lawyer all the same as he hears and helps deal with the issues and problems that arise for the family. But no, the film isn't really about him either rather it is about organised crime as a whole and how it engulfs these people and what they do. Too much happens in the film to list here, but it is a film driven not by pre-figured plot routines but by acts of honour, betrayal and the realistic decisions made by characters we believe are true to life or 'real'. They act on impulse but stay true to the consistency of their mindsets with Michael's sudden urge to take part in an organised 'hit' acting as a particular event, not because Michael is any sort of protagonist and must propel action, but because prior events to do with a targeted and consequentially injured character and Michael's attitudes to this injured character have built up a certain antagonism within Michael's usually cool mindset.Amongst all this, Michael's romance with a woman named Kay (Keaton) is slotted in rather nicely and, like everything else, is developed at its own pace with assured direction from Coppola. The film doesn't really posses an overly complicated narrative and the events are told in a linear format, but the achievement is in getting across this epic sense of progression. It is the getting under the skin of a lifestyle that we watch, the emotional and natural progression of a family, only difference being that this family are a New York based Mafia organisation but with an equally fascinating tale to tell.",8,1,2,10 March 2009
