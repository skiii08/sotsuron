War Dogs," The perfect mixture of Pain and Gain, The Wolf of the Wall street and Lord of War
","Aaaand I liked it! This spectacular, funny, very entertaining movie based on an incredible and absurd true story. I like Todd Phillip's former comedies but a satire is more complex and it hard to find the golden mean between comedy and drama. I think he succeeded it and War dogs is an excellent onefold entertainment but nothing more, it won't be a milestone in movie-history of course. I would highlight the great performances: Jonah Hill portrays his usual adult-Cartman character, he is funny and fatter than ever so it fits to him. I don't really like Bradley Cooper, but he was excellent again. And Miles TellerÂ…he is a big question mark for me, I liked him in Whiplash but I am not convinced about his talent. Anyway he was okay in this film (as anybody else would be). The point is that they created a great couple with Hill and the chemistry works between them. Finally I must mention the cool soundtrack, I liked it so much I will gain it! Summary: 10/7 worth to watch! Etc.: catch the cameo of Dan Bilzerian :))",7,0,0,15 September 2016
