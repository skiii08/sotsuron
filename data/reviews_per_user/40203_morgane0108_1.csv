Hereditary," Best horror movie I've ever seen.
","I've spent my whole life watching horror movies yet there were parts of this movie that left me in utter shock
and horror, left me gasping and hoping they wouldn't go where they did. I can't praise this movie enough.. brutal, crafty, original, eerie, compelling.. just brilliant and utterly disturbing and terrifying. I can't say enough good things.",10,159,326,10 June 2018
