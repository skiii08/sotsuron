Miracle," The real miracle.
","As an avid hockey fan (Go Sharks & Otters!), I remember the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey games like I remember births, deaths, and moon landings.In Miracle, the movie focuses on Herb Brooks, U.S. hockey coach, who died in 2003. Brooks was considered a maverick by the NHL and, because he went his own way with a winning team, is believed to have contributed significantly to the 1980 win. The movie rightly includes the essentials of commentary from Al Michaels (the best hockey commentator bar none), as well as hockey trials, moments from exhibition games, and quite a number of scenes of Olympic games against the Czech and the truly amazing Russian teams. But, the movie actually omits the final pivotal Olympic game against Finland. We see nothing of the elimination of other teams. There is little on the essential player dynamics. One of the most poignant moments in sports, the sight of Jim Craig mouthing 'have you seen my dad?' to a friend in the crowd, is completely overshadowed. Conversely, the film reveals only Jim Craig's familial situation - none of the other players have any family, girlfriends, or other conflicts to concern us.Kurt Russell did a great job of portraying Brooks. Putting on TV commercials and clips was an inspired way to put the movie in context. Adding what the players are doing today was a nice touch, and the clip of Brooks at the end was excellent.But the miracle was not just the coach, it was the time, the circumstances, the fans, and the hockey team, who played game after game after game at Lake Placid. The build up to the win was missing, the grueling games played, the battles. Maybe, like the Christmas celebrations we had as children, you can't go back. There isn't a way to recapture, in film or any other way, what we felt the night they won for us.",6,0,4,19 January 2006
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Kill HIm Already
","I'm all for an oater. Huge fan of John Wayne, John Ford, Gary Cooper. And I'm all for a movie on Jesse James. I've got family from Missouri and relatives inappropriately named for him during the reconstruction.But movie gods, how long are we expected to watch one mentally unstable man wander around tormenting half wits? Here's how I think it's supposed to work: the movie is shorter than the book, and, when it comes to biographies and histories, the book is shorter than the actual event itself. And, since it's live action (this is the most important thing), we're supposed to be entertained. Compared to this, Lawrence of Arabia was a stroll, and Dr. Zhivago a short story. This movie was endless and DULLER than third-generation nylon stockings.All credit to Brad Pitt for successfully making this character thoroughly unlikable, since we know from Devil's Own he can make the bad guys look somewhat charming with a bad accent. And James' character here is the closest to reality - best since The Long Riders (and that was the best until now, far better than some of the laughable depictions seen in The Outlaw and the like).But with Jesse as one endlessly scary dude, I spent most of the movie waiting for the promised old west justice and wishing I had brought my own six shooter so I could put an end to my misery. No nice daffodils or tulips, no sand dunes - nothing to distract me while I'm waiting. And waiting. And waiting. Oh, and since there was nothing to wax lyrical about, I admired everyone's full mouth of beautiful clean teeth (there's historical accuracy for you).Since we all know what happened to Jesse, the only surprise is why I sat through the whole damn film.",1,43,90,21 January 2009
Twilight," End of Day for This Twilight
","OK, read the book first. Clearly, mistake number one. Loved it. Looked forward to this movie for months (mistake number two). I loved the posters and the previews (mistake number three - those were the best part of the movie experience).I'm not clear how you can take subject matter that two-thirds of the teenage English-speaking world, and a good portion of the rest, found riveting, and turn it into dreck, but it happened. I was actually so bored during the 'let's run up the tree and share confidences (so confidential we need not involve the audience... we'll just have burgeoning music)' I nearly walked out. I didn't because I had built this thing up for my husband for months, and I refused to admit I didn't like it.The make-up was dreadful. I expected something like Johnny Depp in Willy Wonka - I got John Waters. The dialog seemed non-existent, and inadequate at best. I liked the actors, but I'm sure I'm showing my age, when I say that I just didn't get why Edward had to have more hair in that odd cut than Wolverine. My husband hadn't read the books, and he didn't feel like there were gaps in the story (actually, he didn't feel there was much of a story) so maybe reading the book didn't make a huge difference...but that's the only reason why I stayed through the whole movie.I think I'll hang on to my money when the next one comes out. If it's like this one, the original author, and my imagination, will be a lot better than the screen version.",4,1,4,17 December 2008
Shine," A Bit Foggy
","After reading the many user reviews, I think it's great that the movie has made more people appreciate Rachmaninoff's music. And I'm glad this movie made people appreciate how fragile the mental psyche can be. I had some challenges, though, getting past the basic premise of the movie.It has been proved, medically, that a traumatic event, or series of traumatic events occurring close together, can trigger a build up of serotonin or other chemical that can cause (in a highly susceptible individual) what would have been called - in those days - a mental breakdown.But the movie shows such ranging symptoms and treatments, it's difficult to understand exactly what happened. Maybe the symptoms changed from adolescence to adulthood? It was like night and day. I would have liked to have understood what happened better, and lacking that information, I found the inconsistent symptoms distracting.I'm sure many will disagree, but I also have to say, many of the children born to WWII survivors and veterans grew up in what would be considered inappropriate or volatile households today. Counseling came in the form of a casserole in those days. The WWII survivors are the lost generation - growing up in an atmosphere of war and terrible fear - and often themselves just a bit mental after all they had been through. As a result, with corporal punishment considered the norm, an overbearing (WWII veteran/survivor) parent was not unusual. What was unusual was how the child reacted.... if the child was predisposed to mental fragility and broke down. I have no quibble with the acting (although I think Noah did the lion's share of the emotional scenes, while Geoffrey did the virtuoso scenes, so I'm not sure who deserved the Oscar more); all were excellent. The filming was lush, the music was quite good. I have gotten to the point where I just want to hear Sir John read the phone book and I'll gush adoringly. Lyn was awesome, Nicholas Bell was excellent, Armin was great.If the script has just given a bit more detail, provided a bit better understanding, I might have been less distracted and more supportive of the character. It was difficult for me to enjoy the movie as a whole because I could not understand the character.",4,6,11,18 July 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Death or Divorce - I Don't Care Which
","I thought there might be something behind all the hype on this movie. I was terribly wrong.I have no idea what Brad and Angelina do at home, because the only relationship that I saw click on the screen, oddly enough, was between Vince and Brad. That bouncing camera work (what is up with that?) just added to all those things that made me slightly nauseous when watching this film. Such as the storyline, which was so full of holes, I think someone from the Swiss Cheese Company Sales Department wrote it - as well as the hackneyed script. The only production 'values' I saw went into that kitchen and tool shed, areas that just added to the potholes in the script.Speaking of which...I have to point out it's really unlikely that the Mr. & Mrs. never noticed the other's stash of guns, cash, etc. Not to mention odd absences, inability to contact each other while traveling, etc... I mean, I don't cook, but I still trot through the kitchen and pull a few drawers open just for fun, and make my own coffee. And if my husband had hair-trigger reflexes, that would be such a difference from his usual stance of 'beer me' that you can be sure I would notice. And I expect to be able to contact my husband by land line to mention there's a skunk in the backyard even if he's just out losing money at poker. The plot just didn't stand up to second thought, not to mention real scrutiny.I didn't even get to see decent costumes - aside from that interesting (and no doubt squeaky) rubber corset, Angelina trotted around in either St. John's Bay or a close replica. There were no secret identity or special costumes to liven things up.I gather there was supposed to be humor (black? dark? sarcasm? of any kind?) in this movie somewhere. I did see a few lines that were funny every time I saw a commercial for the movie. As usual, those were the ONLY lines I found funny in the entire movie (since I had already heard them 400 times, the hilarious thrill was gone for me). Which is too bad - you can get past a cheesy script or impracticalities if there's enough humour - and this concept had potential.Sadly, I found Mr. & Mrs. Smith to be a waste of time. The personal lives of the players involved gave the movie far more attention than it deserved. And this trend of having big (paycheck) 'stars' in bad movies is appalling. At least the old movies with big stars and silly scripts were funny. The fact that there's an audience out there that believes such dreck is actually worth paying to see twice is just pitiful.I myself, because punishment seemed appropriate one day, agreed to watch this movie on HBO for a second time with an Angelina Jolie fan. He turned it off. What does that tell you?",3,0,4,7 September 2006
War of the Worlds," War Between the Family Ferrier - Let the Aliens Win
","So, I've never read War of the Worlds and I've never seen the other versions. I have been so annoyed with Tom Cruise's recent broadcasts regarding prescription medication (if he's so ill-informed, must we hear about it?) there was NO WAY I was going to pay money to see this in the theatres. So, thanks to HBO, here I am, ready to watch this movie with no idea what the plot is but knowing there are aliens that I hope chew up whatever character Tom Cruise plays.Sadly, that didn't happen for me. What I did see was the War between the World of Ferrier and his children, which apparently was what the movie was about, set against a backdrop of some nice special effects implying an alien invasion.I have to admire Dakota Fanning's willingness to just haul out one of those high-pitched parrot screams at a moment's notice. Apparently her lungs are far more flexible than the average child (parents the world over should be grateful). She was whining and panicking throughout the movie ('I want mommmmmmmmmmmm') as if she knew her career as a real actress might be over. What, out of all the children in the world, Tom Cruise happens to have the fragile, mentally gifted Dakota, but doesn't know it? And the character of the disaffected teenager, who alternates between 'I hate Dad' to 'I love War' - there's depth for you. Nice contrast. All the brains in the family were held back until Dakota's character was born? Poor Justin Chatwin didn't have much to work with there.Meanwhile, Tom Cruise was forced to run around trying to keep his children together (it's hard when there are two. Good thing he didn't have, say, three, or a wife to worry about too), save them, try to keep their screaming to a low roar, and put up with those pesky special effects which were apparently representing aliens. And deal with Tim Robbins, who I think was supposed to be nuts but I'm still not really clear. Was he a child molester? A survivalist (surely not - don't they live in less populated areas?) or a alien hunter (don't they all live in Nevada)? The tripods looked great, and the explanation provided by the nice newscaster was very helpful (so handy she popped in to explain what was going on to both Tom Cruise and me, since I hadn't read the book). I didn't really get the connection between the tripods and the individual aliens in the basement (spawn? tripod drivers?), but I'm not as clever or as patient as Tom - I would have chucked Dakota and Justin pretty early on and headed for Nebraska rather than running around looking for the Boston Turnpike like he did.I'm also not clear how suddenly the entire U.S. military force (mobilized how?) suddenly discovered how to kill the tripods, when they weren't having any luck before. Right after our Tom feeds one a few grenades, collective wisdom hits all mankind? Hmmm.And the ending? Oh please, give me a break. Can't imagine they all survived, the ungrateful wretches. And, can't imagine the aliens just call it a day at that point after hundreds of YEARS of planning. I would think the aliens might mull over the day's defeat and come back again, if not obsess over it a bit and come back TOMORROW since we only killed one or two. Hope they do and eat the family Ferrier.So, I thought this would have been a far better movie if only the characters had been a bit more endurable. Maybe Spielberg was trying to make us feel the multiple wars that Cruise was fighting, but I just felt Cruise wasn't prioritizing properly. I found Dakota's character far too annoying to endure (Eat her, quickly so we don't have to hear her scream again), Justin's character unbelievable (fine, join the military. Friendly fire happens), and Cruise (regardless of his personal failings), generally a solid actor, ends up in my opinion on the wrong side.Eat them all.",2,1,2,25 July 2006
The Green Mile," Moving Mile
","I came upon this movie on broadcast TV about close to the end of the broadcast. I normally wouldn't have watched it (I strongly dislike Stephen King movies - if I wanted to be scared, I would be a carnival groupie) and wouldn't have commented on it (didn't see enough of it) but I just had to. Wow.I cried through the last half hour. This movie was stunning. No wonder we all love Tom Hanks. David Morse was amazing. I hated Sam Rockwell with a passion, he played his part so well. And Michael Clarke Duncan - wow. I've seen him in DEBS, on George Lopez, but in this part - so compelling, so touching. The actors made it possible to suspend any disbelief or cynicism and made the story very, very, believable. I've got to rent this movie so I can see it in total. Hopefully after I see the whole thing, I'll still say what I'm thinking now: I'm glad the studio made this movie. In this world of Sky High, Snakes In A Plane and The Whickerman, I don't think that very often.",8,0,1,20 September 2006
Sin City," Difficult Concept, Sinfully Violent
","I've never read the Sin City series, but having dabbled in comic collecting, I have some of Mike Mignola's other work and like it. I'm a huge fan of seeing comic books come to the big screen. And as usual, when something lands on the small screen (HBO) I'm all over it.But even using visually stunning and surreal black/white film didn't hide the incredibly violent adult story and theme. It just wasn't surreal enough.It's one thing to be watching Wily E. Coyote repeatedly survive amazing traumas while trying to get that roadrunner - I thought it was amazingly stupid when TV censors called that 'violent - another to watch live-action Spiderman where there are bright colors and suspense but very little blood, but it's another thing entirely to watch one prostitute rip bloody flesh out of the neck of another with her teeth.Many comic books have violent themes, and graphic novels have been used to address areas that are not easily narrated or require more representation (Maus, for example).But translating such a violent tale to live action, rather than animation - how soon before seeing this type of film makes violence seem commonplace? Comic books reach such a young audience. I was really disappointed with how violent this film was. I saw a later summary of this when it was televised on Starz, which describes it as 'fiercely faithful' but 'outrageously gory' which pretty much says it all.It was visually stunning, the make-up was amazing, and the stories were compelling. I'm sure that it was true to the original comic book, but I'm not sure the material was really meant to be live action - at least, for me.",4,4,8,25 June 2006
Windtalkers," Blowing in the Wind
","This showed up on the history channel and with the husband once again off playing poker I thought, OK, time to ingest a little more history. Only to end up retching over yet another Nicholas Cage bad movie. Now, I just recently saw Con Air for the first time on STARz, so the juxtaposition is unfortunate for his rating, but is he letting his lizard tattoo or Elvis visitations determine his movie selections? Are the script readings done by a psychic? Does he gravitate to stupid characters?I thought I was going to see something that was about World War II, but actually I got to see a silly film filled with characters I've seen so often I could have written this script myself during a silicon valley traffic jam, and done a much better and far more historically accurate job. They all trotted around after the usual conflicted Sergeant - or is Nicolas Cage always conflicted (see fixations above)? - with a Navajo Indian (instead of a representative of some other ethnic group) thrown in to cause racial tension.Let's see, we had the bullying racist, who then has his life saved by an Indian (gee, there's a surprise), the panicking recruit who can't take the pressure and trips the mine field (wow, didn't see that coming), the accepting comrade who (symbolically) blends an harmonica with the Indian's flute (but dies saving the Indian's life, ditto, ditto), the young boy who must grow up too soon (ah, the poignancy), the Army lieutenant that treats everyone like tools (not again!), the mystic wisdom that teaches us all a little something, the constantly breathy flute music (used with all cultural lessons) - have we endured this one before? Not really, because we've never seen quite so many battles, with so many bodies (tossed so high in the air) before, or filmed in Utah while pretending to be Iwo Jima. Was John Woo trying to win some kind of battle-filming contest here? Well, I hope so, because he sure lost a battle with the script.Of course, we had the added stress for poor battle-worn Nicolas Cage that he might have to shoot his code talker rather than have him fall into enemy hands. Quite the sophisticated plot twist, that! Oh no, will Nicolas get too close and feel bad if he has to shoot his young trustee? More conflict! More angst! Cage's specialty! Makes the story so much better, right? Better, but not accurate. Reality: the code wasn't the language - it was a derivative, based on, the Navajo language. If someone was captured, the code would be changed. The prisoner might understand the base language, but not the code itself. Oh, yeah, periodically the Indians, who I believe were the original inspiration for the movie, would get to talk back and forth in Navajo, and we would get to see the translation on the screen. They would say their position (not in actual code). Oh, and one time in the movie, the Japanese noticed the Americans weren't speaking English. And another time, according to the movie, the Japanese attempted to capture an Indian who was just standing around the front line because somehow they knew he was a code talker. Right. They guessed in the middle of combat that he wasn't Hawaiian or Japanese American, he was an American Indian. And they also had somehow figured out that the language that wasn't English was a derivative of an American Indian dialect, and therefore this man must be a Code Talker. Right there in the middle of the battle. Alrighty then. (It must be similar wisdom that causes me to doubt the veracity of this incident.) These incidents brought history alive for me, alright.Reality: Code talkers were translating messages NON STOP throughout the taking of Iwo Jima. Which makes it difficult to understand how the Navajos would have been hacking and shooting away on the battlefield, or standing around the front lines, and going through that growing-up-too-soon stuff. Reality: They were able to communicate three times faster than previous codes had hustled along, but like any other job, the number of messages increased to fill the time available. Seems to be a bit of a discrepancy between busy busy real code talker life and Hollywood. Oh, sorry. That's a duh.In addition to not understanding the difference between a language and a code (is this rocket science?) the soldiers in the film didn't even wear the right dog tags. Reality: I've got my dad's dog tags from WWII, and you can get a lovely facsimile at the Smithsonian gift store right now. Were they not stylish enough? Was it more exciting to use choke chain dog tags? Every time I saw a soldier I saw an anachronism. As in big fat mistake.I do appreciate that at least we have a movie in these Politically Correct days where we had two sides to a war: good guys and bad guys. You don't see that very often any more, so points to John Woo for that one area.But I'm getting away from what was really going on in the movie, which was all about battered, bruised, benighted and badgered Nicholas Cage, who talked to the Navajo like Clint Eastwood talked to the trees in Paint Your Wagon. Not to mention the usual angst-ridden and conflicted stuff he faces. I got very little wind talking, and an awful lot of wind blowing out of this movie. All it did for the important role the Navajo (and Comanche in the European Theatre) Indians played during WWII was bring them up in conversation - too many inaccuracies to be of any other use.",4,22,34,16 September 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Talledega Slump
","I have to disclose that I watched this on an airplane, and there may have been some absolutely gut-busting hilarity in the film that I missed because the sound was bad. I'm hoping there was, because otherwise the the best part of this movie was the outtakes.I found Will Ferrell to be funny playing a supporting character in Old School. Although Elf seemed like the same joke over and over, I admired Ferrell's willingness to search so hard for new ways to act like an idiot. Anchorman Ron Burgundy had its brief moments - and Christina Applegate is very competent - but it went a bit downhill after the fight scene. Perhaps Will Ferrell reached his pinnacle with Bewitched, where he was joined by not one, but many extremely competent actors - I don't think Bewitched was that great, but compared to Ferrell's previous offerings, it was Shakespeare.Talledega Nights put a similar character to Ron Burgundy behind the wheel of a race car in what should have been an enjoyable parody of Nascar. Since Nascar is a cultural event that offers so much to work with, I had high hopes for entertainment. The rise and fall of Nascar collectible plate prices alone could have kept the movie going for half an hour, and the name of Ferrell's character showed an awareness of the potential.This film, though, seemed to follow the same pattern of your more recent Will Ferrell movies. In fact, they're so predictable I may start writing scripts for him in my spare time using the following formula: man has supercilious personality plus everything; man loses everything (here's where Will usually runs around in his BVDs) and is in depths of despair; at last, man is inspired, no longer supercilious, and rises to the occasion while learning a heart-warming yet gut-busting lesson.For some reason, Nascar didn't offer enough to parody, and we had to add a homosexual relationship to the mix. If the attempt to parody Nascar wasn't offensive to true Nascar fans, I'm sure the French race driver kissing his male lover put the nail in the coffin. I'm disappointed the film stooped to this level of humor when there is so much available in the Bible Belt.To haul out a quick soapbox, I am compelled to point out that the state of contemporary comedic film is beyond sorry. We've got literally thousands of stand-up comics throughout the country with immense skills. We have classic films as guidelines, ranging from gross-out to urbane, that are hysterically funny. And then Hollywood churns out a film like this one. This is the best we have to offer? When you think that these films are exported to the international market, it's no wonder other countries find us loud and annoying. The outtakes indicated there was a lot of ad-libbing on the set, and I can only hope that the best lines were lost because the ones in the film were either tired, about three lines too long (oh, it's a joke. I get it), or just lame. I'm sure that means there will be a sequel. Perhaps it, like this, will pass the time on an airplane. There wasn't much else to recommend Talledega Nights.",3,2,5,25 November 2006
