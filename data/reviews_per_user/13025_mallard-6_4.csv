Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Wonderful!
","Simply stated, the movie is WONDERFUL. It gives us our only glimpse, ever, of Donald and Daffy together! It provides a (rather bumblingly) heroic rabbit lead! It is a fine mix of live action and animation! It is a great detective film! It has everything needed in a great movie: drama, suspense, sexy heroines, loathsome villaim, cuteness, wit, etc. A MUST SEE! A MUST BUY!!!!!",10,0,0,26 May 1999
Rear Window," Just about the best of the best--a perfect film!
","From Hitchcock to Kelly to Stewart to Ritter to Burr--an ideal blending of massive talents. This is a favorite summer movie for me--it captures the heat and humidity of New York so perfectly. It creates an enclosed and totally credible world--the central courtyard among a heap of apartment buildings. It is suspense, humor, all that is needed to make it a truly classic film!",10,1,3,5 August 1999
Tarzan," A new Disney classic! Among Disney's best!
","This is a most enjoyable film. It is bright, coherent, funny, suspensful, colorful, and fulfilling. The characters are well conceived and brilliantly executed. This is a Disney film in the best traditions of the Disney studios--miles above Pochahantus, better far than Hercules or Hunchback, on a par with Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Dumbo, etc.",9,2,2,7 September 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Grand adventure. Dynamic leads. Fun and suspense. Hot hot hot film!
","What can one say, with 2 stars of the stellar magnitude of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford at their peak, what could go wrong? Nothing goes wrong in this jim-dandy adventure film. It's packed with excitement, humor, and suspense. From first to last, a totally wonderful experience. I have watched time and again and not grown tired of this film.YOU MUST SEE IT!",8,3,5,5 August 1999
