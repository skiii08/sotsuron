Hereditary," Awful movie
","One of the the most tediously boring movies I have ever seen.
Not a horror film at all just arty scenes and weird music 
Don't waste your time watching this
I have seen it compared to the babadook and the shining but I loved both of those movies ...this is just a few shocking scenes connected by a lot of spooky looking surroundings and wired miniature doll houses. 
If I had to compare to something I would say the original versions of the wicker man and rosemarys baby",1,3,6,26 August 2018
