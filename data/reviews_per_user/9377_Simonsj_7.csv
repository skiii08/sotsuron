Raiders of the Lost Ark," What an adventure!
","I rate this movie with the highest available vote. Is it worth it? Not really, seen as a movie. But for me, the Raiders aresomething special. When I saw this movie for the first time as achild, I loved the action.Later, I've realized that the movie lacks in other qualities. It'smoves to fast and has a touch of low budget and a tight filmingschedule. On the other hand, I've come to appreciate IndianaJones weaknesses (he's all but perfect) nicely portrayed byHarrison Ford who is supported by a great cast.However, I might have discovered the movies weaknesses, butthat doesn't matter. When I watch this movie, I can't 'help' feelingan childish anticipation and joy, and I love it. This movie willalways have a special place in my movie-heart...",10,0,0,30 December 2001
Happy Gilmore," Great comedy
","One of the funniest movies I ever seen. Sometimes it's good to see a movie that's just make you laugh. Unfortunately doesn't the movies with Adam Sandler that follows have the same 'we have a lot of fun filming this movie'-feeling. However, Happy Gilmore is a great comedy that I recommend.",8,1,1,27 February 2001
Mission: Impossible II," This is NOT Mission: Impossible
","This was a really, really bad movie. If it supposed to be Mission: Impossible. But as a plain action movie, it's quite good. The Mission: Impossible-series and movies are not particulary realistic, but  it  MIGHT happen in real life some way. But this movie..., for example the way Tom Cruise handled the motorcykel is not serious or realistic. In this movie, Tom Cruise is a superman. He is doing everything by himself and his co-workers are just sitting by.In Mission: Impossible, there SHOULD be a TEAM solving the impossible mission.. If you are a Mission: Impossible-fan, use your money to rent the first movie and watch that again. It's much, much better. If you just want to see some nice, well done, braindead action (as we would sometimes) this is a good movie (and should have the name 'SuperTom fixes everything').",3,0,1,16 July 2000
Die Hard," A great action movie
","When I saw this movie in 1988, I thought it was the best actionmovie I had ever seen (Raiders of the lost Ark not included). Thenit was the good and intense action scenes that were important.When I see the same film today, the action scenes still are goodand intense, but I can appreciate the plot and acting more. BruceWillis is actually good in this movie! He actually lets his characterJohn McClane to be cool, scared and even a bit vulnerable. In thesequels he is just a cool mean killing machine.But do not be fooled. Die Hard is not an `Ingmar Bergman'-drama,nor it tries to be. Never the less, Bruce Willis gives his charactermore than a single dimension (I can not say the same thing aboutthe sequels or other action movies he has done).So, Willis acting (not to forget good actors as Alan Rickman), JohnMcTiernans directing, great footage/camerawork and a good script(based on a novel) lifts this action movie above many others madebefore, during and after this one.",8,1,3,8 April 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the greatest movies ever!
","This is an example that Hollywood CAN do a great movie that doesn't solely build on special effects.This is also a proof that not all movies need to have more 'pace' or 'action'. The ingredients in this movie is the interaction between two great actors, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, a very good support cast, a superb story by Stephen King and a professional crew. This 'soup' is very tasteful and gets 10/10 by me.",10,0,0,8 December 2002
The Matrix," One heck of a f/x-movie
","God story line (yes it has some logical holes, but tell me any movie who doesn't), incredible stunts and unbelievable special effects.Can it be any better? Of course it can, but this movie would be difficult to beat in its genre.One drawback, though, you can tell that The Matrix has too much influences of Anime films.",9,0,0,27 March 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Higher quality, but lacks something
","Great action, great actors (as Sean Connery and Harrison Ford)and a great story make this a very good movie. The interactionbetween Connery and Ford is very good.However, it does lacks something. Something I can't put my fingeron... The feeling that was present in the first movie I believe. So thevote is high, but not as high as the Raiders",8,0,0,30 December 2001
