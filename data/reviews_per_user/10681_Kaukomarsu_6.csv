The Mask," Non-stop fun
","Seeing this film for the first time back in 1994, unaware of its roots in Tex Avery's cartoons and such made a lasting effect on me. Jim Carrey is in top form in this fast-paced package of laughs, action and great music (the sequence at the Coco Bongo Club stands in my opinion as one of the greatest and funniest musical performances caught on film). But let's not forget the colorful visuals and beautiful, on-the-spot photography, that really makes this film shine. As old-fashioned as this film is in many ways, it's also simply irresistible. Hold on to your seat, The Mask is coming!",9,0,0,28 August 2006
Walk the Line," Very touching story with brilliant actors
","Personally, I wasn't familiar with the life story of Johnny Cash before seeing this movie. I was interested about his music, though, so I had quite big expectations. Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Cash. Knowing he did his own singing in the movie makes me respect him even more. The same can be said of Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. The two have good chemistry on screen, and it's a joy to watch the story unfold when two actors in great roles carry it on. But I think the most important thing in 'Walk the Line' is Cash's music. The songs are very carefully picked and fit in the story perfectly. 'Walk the Line', in my opinion, is a near-perfect movie. Go see it.",9,0,0,5 February 2006
Star Trek," This is how a franchise reboot should be done!
","First things first: I have never been a huge Star Trek fan. Sure, I've seen the Original Series and I watched Next Generation.Now, more than 40 years after the Original Series, finally a bold new version of Star Trek has seen the light of day. It's action-packed, it's beautiful to look at and it's funny. It's everything a good space adventure should be, simply a great time at the movies.I haven't been a huge fan of J.J. Abrams, either. Sure, Alias was fun at times, but Lost always left me cold. Cloverfield was kind of silly, although the idea was interesting. Mission: Impossible III was fair entertainment, but nothing unforgettable.In Star Trek, Abrams has tackled a huge challenge - and he succeeds in the seemingly impossible task. The new cast is familiar and exciting at the same time. The visuals are simply stunning. The story is strong, and the script gives the actors plenty to work with.It all shows in the final product. It's sleek, it's fun, it's interesting, even thought-provoking. That's really almost more than you could ask from a big summer movie. But it's all here.Welcome back, Star Trek - may you live long and prosper!",9,1,6,8 June 2009
Lost in Translation," Like a dream
","This is a beautiful and moody film featuring excellent performances and a wonderful soundtrack. I really love it because it is so simple; it has only a little dialog, yet it manages to leave an unforgettable impact on the viewer; it is so beautifully photographed, it leaves you hoping you were a filmmaker and came up with all these wonderful scenes and images yourself; it is so clever in setting its story in Tokyo, you really live with the characters as they navigate in those almost alien surroundings.All in all, in my opinion this is a near-perfect film. It is mainstream film-making at it's farthest form, really becoming art. Yet it features two big movie stars, both contributing the best of their generation in the film. The chemistry between Murray and Johansson is palpable; it is wonderful how the viewer 'gets' this through the silent scenes. It is the artistry of director Sofia Coppola that combines all these elements so effortlessly and easily. It all feels so true, so natural.",10,9,17,15 December 2006
Avatar," Beautiful to look at, nothing more
","The hype machine has made Avatar a genuine movie event. In a technical and visual sense the hype is understandable – we have not seen anything like Avatar before. A film with photo-realistic 3D-environments created on a computer, but totally immersive. It is a great achievement, and it should be regarded as one.But one should also look beneath the stunning visuals, because therein lies the real film with its real problems. The storyline and characters are unoriginal to say the least. Frankly, we have seen this story a thousand times before: consider 'Dances with the Wolves', for example. The Na'vi are obvious Native Americans; the evil corporate types are Western settlers, cowboys coming to conquer and exploit their lands.And of course we need the hero, who switches sides and fights for the natives against the evil corporation. There is the Gun-ho military type who 'fights terror with terror'. Oh, come on. Yes, James, we got your little reference to the American War on Terror. Avatar is also too long, it's painfully too long. I don't understand why the filmmakers of today have such difficulty of ending their films. You could've easily chopped out 30 minutes of Avatar without it having any effect on the 'story', or rather 'the series of happenings'.So; beautiful 3D-visuals, nothing more. Oscar-worthy? Come on! It may be the biggest blockbuster of all time, but that does not make it Oscar-worthy. Oscar-worthy films have notable performances by the cast and strong, original writing; Avatar has neither. It is technological achievement, and should be noted as one, but it is not great film-making in the sense that should be awarded with Oscars. The two billion or so dollars it has made on the box office should be enough.",2,8,13,9 February 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Papa's got the same old bag
","I went to see Die Hard 4.0 (as it's called here in Europe) expecting the same kind of tongue- in-cheek and tough action as the excellent first film, a mediocre second one and a somewhat better third provided.I was disappointed. Not only is Die Hard 4.0 quite humorless, it doesn't have any new ideas, although a couple of action scenes are impressive. It's completely laughable how clichéd some of the characters are: McClanes daughter for example. The villains are another problem; the main one is just boring and the tougher sidekick gets killed WAY too early.4.0 has a lot in common with the first film. McClane talks with the villains over radio, there is a family member to rescue and even that certain famous line from the first film gets recycled. But it's the script and dialogue which really are terrible. I don't know why Hollywood's action writers still have a strange perversion for satellite phones. And helicopters. And why in the year 2007 do we still have stupid, huge control centers with a lot of blinking lights? All that stuff aside, as I said some action scenes are good, but in the end Die Hard 4.0 is just a hollow and tired rewarming of an old franchise that should have been left in the 1980s and 90s.",2,7,14,4 July 2007
