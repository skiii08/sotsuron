Source Code," Tired Plot + Confusing Sci-Fi Tech = 2 hrs lost
","First: As an IT Professional, the title 'Source Code' is a misnomer.Second: To anyone who was a fan of 'Quantum Leap' - like I was - this movie comes dangerously close to that .. minus the 8 minute criteria.Third: The technology explained in the movie was a total white-wash of what is remotely feasible. The concept of retaining the soul post-mortem and basically drafting it into military service doesn't add up.Fourth: We the people are tired of seeing good ol' WASPie Americans, the kind that are least likely to be racially profiled, now becoming the poster children for anti-US, domestic terrorism in the name of 'Patriotism'.Last: The movie yields more questions than it entertains - a bad thing! It ends up painting itself into a time paradox (where if he goes back in time to fix 1 thing, what effect did that fix have in the future? is it the same future or an alternate? .. and so on) - a worse thing! Overall 2/10. Good actors, weak plot, terrible storyline",2,11,21,16 April 2011
