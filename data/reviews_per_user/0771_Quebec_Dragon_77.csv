Whip It," High-spirited and entertaining even for those who know nothing about the sport
","Whip it might actually be more of a coming of age story than an actual sports film about roller derby. A young introverted woman played by Ellen Page is forced to participate in regional beauty pageants by her mother while working part-time at the Oint Joint (a diner) with her best friend. Early on, she goes secretly to a roller derby match and eventually decides to try out for a team which of course accepts her (or there would be no movie ;-). I found the movie, like the sport itself, was charming and appealing but rough around the edges. The introductions of the different players with their kooky names (Bloody Holly, Smashley Simpson, etc) were amusing although most were only nicknames with little or no personality. The Manson sisters (probably an homage to the Hanson brothers from Slapshot) were introduced and then mostly forgotten. I enjoyed the team camaraderie and high spirits. We get why such an activity could be empowering especially for shy women.It doesn't matter if you know nothing about roller derby before watching it. They explain the basics and besides the winning or losing is secondary. I knew a little about the rules myself having watched an actual match and they took lots of creative liberties regarding penalties. The actual game is not as violent (although to be honest, nothing too extreme in this movie either) and most of the plays from the coach would be illegal. So it turns out, I would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't seen real roller derby before. On the other hand, seeing the movie beforehand might have given me the wrong impression about the sport. The playing shown on the screen is frankly not that spectacular or exciting. There's no real tension regarding the match progression. Seems to me it might be because the players from the main character's team were the actresses instead of actual pro players. Not necessarily a bad choice.Mainly, we follow Ellen Page's character in her emancipation from her parents through her new circle of friends and first love. Despite the tattoos and attitude of some of the girls, it's really rather tame and politically correct. Even the 'love' scene in a pool is more poetic than erotic, not even showing actual complete nudity. It reminds me that for the boys hoping for eye candy, the majority of the girls are not that sexy either in looks or outfits except perhaps for Eva Destruction and even then it's tasteful. The character progression of the main character Bliss is gradual and good. The mother/daughter relationship is also nice with a particularly well done dramatic scene on the floor of a kitchen. I think the one-on-one relationship moments between Bliss and various characters are the highlights. Comedy wise, the funny side comes mostly from the antics on the tracks (doesn't go over-the-top ridiculous) and the team players outside. Nothing laugh-out-loud funny but it made me smile a few times. Teenage girls and young women will probably love this film provided they have a little rebellious side to them. There is a satisfying feminist/girl power subtext here. Everyone else, including guys, will probably find it entertaining if they keep in mind that it's more of a dramatic comedy about one girl with a sports theme than a sports drama following a team. Films featuring a girls sports team are rather rare and fortunately Whip it is a pretty good one. Roller derby fans or players will cringe at some of the moves but like the film if they can get beyond that. Rating : 6 out of 10 (good)",6,3,6,20 August 2010
Sucker Punch," Almost felt suckered... would you?
","There were lots of punches. There was a sucker (lollipop). I wasn't sucker punched by surprise but I almost felt suckered for paying full price at the theatre. Let's start by saying that I loved all of Zack Snyder's previous films but this one left me perplexed. The story has 3 layers of 'reality': 1) Our heroine is placed unjustly in a mental institution 2) She's stuck in a cabaret club/whorehouse 3) She's a super-powered fighter in a wild mix of settings involving giant samurais, steam-powered Nazi zombies, dragons and robots amongst others. Yes, it's a bit like an unholy mash-up of different films: Inception/Brazil/One Flew Over the Cuckoo' Nest/Moulin Rouge/Kill Bill in certain ways but less complex and particularly less emotionally involving. Our main heroine flees her unbearable situation through imagination, a theme I certainly love in movies, but I certainly wish the 'visions' had been less superficial.Weirdly, I found the first 'reality' (asylum) the most gripping (especially the intro) but it's the one where we spend the least time. For me, it seemed that the deeper and more spectacular the setting was, the least I was involved. Those settings in the third layer were mostly action-oriented, extremely simplistic (like missions in a bad video game) yet visually spectacular. They were like a crazy mix of pulp/genre archetypes that are not usually combined. To be honest, it was like nothing I had ever seen before. Those action scenes/special effects were expertly done, but somehow left me cold and uninvolved the longer they ran. It's as if I didn't care. They felt 'hollow'.This brings me to perhaps the biggest problem of the film. The characters are not developed or characterized enough making vicarious identification difficult if not impossible. The sense of danger or the losses were not really felt, at least for me. I liked Rocket well enough (probably because of the actress' performance) but 2 of the female characters (Blondie and Amber) were cardboard-thin and the others weren't that great. At first glance, the story itself seems complex but is in fact rather simple (not bad in itself). It's just not particularly well told. I saw the 'sucker punches' coming a mile away, either that or I didn't really care one way or the other.The main villain lacked a certain something to make him truly special or threatening, which is a shame because this movie begged for a villain we could truly love to hate. The sensei, who could have been played by David Carradine, was the only likable man in this pic but his involvement was limited mostly to story exposition. I didn't care much for the washed-out color schemes in the different layers but it's a defensible stylistic choice. The cinematography itself is quite stylish as usual for Zack Snyder. You certainly recognize the director's signature touches although he overindulges in some of his favorites moves (witness: when the girls land on the ground).For 2 different recurring elements, he intentionally hides what's happening (the dance and later the face) and I found that rather clever and mysterious in a good way. The soundtrack consists mostly of known pop/alternative songs, either cover or original, and they fit tremendously well giving a real 'punch' to the scenes. However, a little more than halfway through, the choices seemed less inspired, not bad per say but not great as before.Should you watch Sucker Punch? Probably not at full price in the theatre but just for the amazing visuals later on, yes. Especially if you're a fan of the director's previous works. The story and characters will likely disappoint though.Rating: 5.5 out of 10 (average-good)",5,4,8,10 April 2011
Source Code," How thinking too much can almost ruin an otherwise decent flick
","At its simplest, this seems to be the story of a guy reliving the last 8 minutes of someone else on a train over and over before it explodes. How and why is for you to discover. I had a peculiar experience watching this film. At first, I was quite engrossed by the mystery element and the paranoia of what's going on and who's responsible. However, as time went on, I kept being taken out of the picture. My sense of disbelief was hurt because I was finding big logical flaws. I was left dissatisfied and frustrated. However, after reading more about the Source Code concept and the ending online, it seems I was unfair about the logical flaws. The problem is that it's implied, and you assume, it takes place in someone's else memories and/or some kind of virtual reality based on those. As such, our hero shouldn't be able to discover certain things because the person he's in doesn't know them because he never saw them. It's worse when the camera shows you other people without the hero there. If he's not there, how does he know that's happening? So, my big piece of advice for enjoyment of the movie is not to dwell too much on the science explanation part, that in my opinion was lacking. It's probably not what you might think or even what the main scientist thinks. Check on the Internet afterwards to understand as I did.With that out of the way, let's write about the rest. I thought the directing was excellent with dynamic camera movement in rather small enclosed environments (the train and somewhere else). The recurring fire explosion in slow-motion was sometimes quite artistic. The story was good with nice suspense (despite the repeating), a few very good twists and a few far-fetched occurrences. The science aspect should have been explained better. The main character was acted very well by Gyllenhaal. He excels at playing distress, uncertainty and anxiety. The leading actress was quite fetching and likable, making for good chemistry. The train passengers were unfortunately mostly cardboard-thin (why was it mostly men?). We weren't made to care for them. It's not a special effects heavy movie. It starts as thriller, then veers toward drama and romance. I wasn't really moved by any of it, but I liked the romantic aspect. I didn't care about the ending as it felt like a focus audience consensus, and at that point, I thought it didn't make any sense (unfairly so). The product placement was really irritating. All in all, I think it's an enjoyable movie that I'd have liked more if my brain hadn't picked (mostly unfair) holes in it while watching.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)",6,3,4,28 January 2012
Star Trek," Satisfied but still hungry for more
","I admit I got sucked in by the great reviews and that my expectations were probably too high. I had a good time but I wasn't blown away by it. Why? Weirdly, it might be some of the plot elements (mostly scientific) that hindered my enjoyment. They seemed illogical as Mr. Spock would say. I know Star Trek is supposed to be space opera but the thinking man's humanistic space opera and those seemingly illogical elements created plot holes and coincidences that bugged me. I was even thinking of including most of them in this review with an attempt at explanations but it would make this too long and way too geeky ;-) (read the lower-rated reviews on IMDb if you're curious). Don't get me wrong, the script is fun with enjoyable character moments, a few good surprises, its fair share of adventure and space scenes but enjoy the ride and try not to think too hard.I loved the introduction in space. I thought it was great, dramatic and surprising. The young years of Kirk would have benefited from a little more time but one shouldn't be too greedy and it would have taken time from somewhere else. The casting of the movie was very strong with the highlights for me being the new Spock (the guy actually made me forget his other famous role as Sylar in Heroes) and Dr. McCoy (cynical and even looking very similar). It's amazing how Star Trek references have seeped into modern culture and I think almost anyone, even non-Trekkers, will enjoy the references and homages, especially how the younger actors play their iconic counterparts without turning them into bad caricatures (some might disagree about Chekhov and Scotty but I personally loved them). Almost every crew member besides Kirk and Spock has its moment in the spotlight and yet you wish you would see more of them which is a compliment in itself. The villain would have benefited from being better; he was definitely the weak link. He was underwhelming and stupid. I'm not sure if the culprit was the writing or the interpretation by Eric Bana, probably a mix of both. I also disliked the little alien partner of Scotty and I have no idea why he was included except perhaps to add a cutesy factor and sell action figures.Most of the introductions, meetings and interactions between the adult crew members were joyous and sometimes surprising. The story does keep you guessing as to what will happen next after a particular major event. The pace was good, it was filmed dynamically but the fight scenes were victims of zoomed in shaky cameras preventing us from really seeing them well. Not as bad as other recent American films though. The visual effects were very good except for a few blinding lens flares. There were a couple of moments where I got the shivers (good ones) but then that's because I've been a fan of Star Trek for so long. One was when I saw the Enterprise for the first time (very well modernized yet faithful to the old exterior look, not really so in the inside) and the other time in the middle I cannot reveal except to say that this line made me realize that anything could happen. One could argue that the writers could have been bolder making for a stronger dramatic story but at the risk of alienating the hardcore faithful who might be offended by the reboot anyway. Those trekkers might say the new Star Trek movie invalidates every other Star Trek story out there. I prefer to think that those stories might still be mostly valid (especially those from Next Generation and after) or at least valid in a parallel dimension/universe/timeline whatever. The new Star Trek does free the writers to boldly go where no one has gone before. It was a valiant fun effort well worth watching but I do hope the next instalment is more clever and logical while retaining (or improving) emotional resonance.Rating: 7 out of 10",7,2,6,7 May 2010
Citizen Kane," New review from first time watcher: Kane still good today?
","Why another review of Citizen Kane, a movie that made its mark in cinema history and is often regarded as the best film of all time? I'm not sure why. Perhaps it's to put my two cents in and to share what a 36-year old first time watcher but movie aficionado thinks about it. I was amazed it was made in 1941. It's in black and white but has modern original cinematography. It was revolutionary back then and I still regard it as original today. The plays of shadows and lights, who is lit up or not, and how, are not only beautiful but are evocative and serve storyline purposes. The transitions from scene to scene, backgrounds and foregrounds old and new fading out or in, are amazingly well done. Even today, you rarely see anything as artistic as this. The flashbacks and flash-forwards are very cleverly done (witness the diner table scene between Kane and his wife going from early twenties to middle age). The makeup in Kane is for the most part positively astounding and ages the characters better than most modern films. The camera angles are mostly unconventional, playing often with perspective for story purposes (notice Kane smaller in the background during bad moments or bigger than life when things go well). There are quite a few shots (Kane standing underneath a giant poster of himself for one) that are quite memorable and still powerful. I could go on but technically this movie is a marvel even today.Despite the unconventional story structure, you never get lost, although you might be temporarily confused, and it makes the whole storyline very engaging. It follows the trials and tribulations of a very rich and influential newspaper mogul from childhood to his death but not in chronological order. As a matter of fact, the film starts with the death of Kane, followed by a newsreel (like in old World War II screenings) recapping his whole life and then followed by an investigation into Rosebud, his mysterious last word. It's inspired by the life of real newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst who tried his very best to destroy this movie... literally. There are lots of creative liberties taken but if you study the background, you will notice the similarities. It's a great story extremely well told. You might not care about Kane but he's certainly a rich, complex and fascinating character. He's played by the director Orson Welles and he shows a wide range of emotions and acts differently according to age, not just in demeanor but physically. The other actors, most of them newcomers to cinema, are very fine although a few succumb, including Welles sometimes, to overacting just a tad (they were mostly theater actors which would explain the theatrics I suppose). On first viewing, I found the mistress of Kane particularly annoying and badly acted to the point of being grating but on second thought, I think she was supposed to be that way, a bit of a superficial simple floozy.Overall, I was impressed, despite high expectations, at how original, enjoyable and artistic Citizen Kane remains in 2009. It might not be one of my favorite films, nor would I consider it the best film of all time but I think it still appeals to modern sensibilities and deserves its reputation as a masterpiece. I highly recommend finding a copy of your own, preferably with the great commentary track by the famous critic Roger Ebert (Kane being his favorite film of all time) and with the illuminating documentary about the Battle of Citizen Kane showing the conflict between director/main actor Orson Welles and Kane's inspiration: Hearst, as well as their biographies.Rating: 9 out of 10 (not a 10 because I wasn't moved or awed as much as a few other select films)",9,8,11,30 July 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Bring on the hate
","I might be one of the only people crying foul but aren't we getting diminishing returns with Tarantino since Kill Bill 2 ? I was majorly disappointed with Inglourious Basterds. I found the film weak, unsatisfying and plain long. It seems that Tarantino is writing longer and longer (and longer) conversation pieces or monologues about mundane or inane subjects with a very short (or no) payoff at the end. In his earlier filmography, those parts used to be clever, somewhat brilliant despite their outward superficiality but he did limit them, pace them better and they were nowhere near as self-indulgent as in Basterds. He relies on the quality of his actors to keep our collective interest but that can only go so far. I suppose those drawn-out conversations can build up a certain tension if you're patient enough and that Tarantino delights in doing the unexpected even with characters you think might be major. I'll give him some credit for subverting usual movie clichés, which might be due to his extensive movie knowledge.Regarding the featured Basterds commando, they were a disappointment. Besides their leader (Brad Pitt's character) who sounds and looks more like a southern redneck than a Jewish American, the other members of the commando have extremely little screen time, even less talking time and zero personality. Being angry and killing Nazis with a baseball bat is not good characterization. If you were expecting some kind of over-the-top revenge trip on Nazis by the Jews, you'll get very little satisfaction even at the end as the Jews themselves are basically superfluous. I would argue that the German characters shown here are, in general, more interesting, likable and/or multifaceted. You almost feel sorry for some of them (which perhaps was Tarentino's intention but then he should have worked more on the Jewish characters to compensate). The actions scenes are usually quick and cringe-worthy with a longer set-piece at the end that was not particularly exhilarating or well shot. I know violence in real life is probably like that but their shortness was accentuated by the very static overly long conversations.The most memorable character by far is the SS colonel Hans Landa. Beyond his amazing linguistic skills (my native language is french and his was very good), you'll enjoy his suave friendly unpredictable antics. He manages to make extremely long conversations somewhat bearable through sheer screen presence. I also liked very much Brad Pitt's enthusiastic and fun portrayal of Aldo Raine even though he's caricatured and not particularly believable. The 2 characters above are mostly responsible for the few funny bits. The cast in general was very good especially the 2 female leading roles. Certain trends (or trademarks) in Tarentino's film-making are getting worse and you should avoid this if you're looking for great action, comedy or war film unless you're really keen on overlong Tarentino-type dialogue and want to see great multilingual acting.Rating: 4 out of 10",4,22,41,5 October 2009
Alien: Resurrection," An Alien movie made by the Amelie's director?
","Believe it or not, it works and he did a wonderful job. You can even see some of his trademark french humor and quirky style and he does so without sacrificing the surprises and horrific moments. However, it's not as scary and tense as the first film, not as thrilling and action-packed as the second but way better in every way than the boring and confusing third. Alien Resurrection was lots of fun to watch. I thought the creatures looked pretty darn good and we see more of them than in any other Alien movie (don't know about Aliens VS Predators though). The 'Ripley' in this one was fascinating to me and Sigourney Weaver is to be commended for her performance. I also enjoyed most of the secondary characters who were quite well characterized. Although you'll get the good old infamous scenes (like the chestbursters), I liked the few new concepts introduced here, which I cannot reveal for fear of spoilers. The script by Josh Whedon was dynamic and very interesting. Overall, a very good return to form after the Alien 3 mess.Rating: 7 out of 10",7,2,3,26 May 2009
Oldboy," The kind of movie that won't grow old.
","An alcoholic father and husband is captured and kept in captivity during 15 years without knowing why. When he gets out, he's hell-bent on revenge and discovering why he was imprisoned. This is a powerful movie with strong dramatic performances. It's intense and constantly keeps you on your toes. The story is amazing and full of twists and turns until the very end. Speaking of twists, the film is a bit twisted in itself by the themes it portrays. It does make us question what is moral and acceptable in revenge. The directing is bold and inventive.There's a long fight scene without cuts in a corridor that's practically an anthology piece. Other memorable moments involve teeth and a tongue. Notice how the director often plays with our expectations showing relatively little but creeping us out nevertheless. The story also plays with our perceptions of the characters, making them more or less sympathetic. The main character has quite the character arc transformation, completely changing physically and psychologically during the course while keeping the viewer on edge because he's a bit unstable... So, it's overall quite fascinating, intellectually stimulating, viscerally gripping, and heartily recommended provided you don't expect a simple, typical revenge movie and you keep an open mind.Rating: 8.5 out 10 (remarkable)",9,7,12,17 July 2011
Pirate Radio," Smooth and sweet music comedy (not a musical)
","Pirate Radio is a fun and entertaining film bolstered by great music and a strong ensemble cast. In the sixties, the powers that be in Britain were so uptight that they did not even really broadcast rock/pop songs on their radio stations (less than an hour per day if that) even though it was in its heyday. Enter DJ radio 'pirates' broadcasting rock from boats in international waters. The story mostly takes place on one of those rock radio boats. We're in a relatively small confined place but it doesn't feel claustrophobic as we often cut to wonderful little scenes of people from Great Britain from all walks of life, young and old, listening in and having a ball. Or we cut to efforts by Hitler look-a-like Kenneth Brannagh, a government official, trying everything to shut them down.The story relies on the personalities of its characters for its laughs, as well as their friendships/rivalries and it works. At least for the male characters, the few females ones are underdeveloped and superficial. Most of the 'heroes' are likable and good-natured. The film has an enthusiastic and high-spirited feel to it, making you smile most of the time and making you wish you could have hung out with those guys. It doesn't veer into excessive drug use, wild orgies or crazy partying. Nor does it go really dark, keeping its dry humor, even in the dramatic moments. Those dramatic moments could have been more effective but then they were probably defused by the good time I was having. The ending also felt a bit over long and convenient although it had some amusing bits. Pirate Radio is not really romantic despite the track record of the director (screenplay writer of Notting Hill and 4 Weddings and a Funeral), nor is it extremely laugh-out-loud funny but it's certainly entertaining and worth watching especially if you love music from the sixties. I'm not very knowledgeable about it but I still enjoyed myself.Rating: 7.5 out of 10",8,5,8,24 November 2009
Superbad," Great teen comedy
","I'm very difficult when it comes to comedies and this had me smiling, sometimes laughing, throughout. It's raunchy, immature, irreverent, gross but also funny and weirdly sincere and heartwarming. I think what helps a lot here is that the teenagers really look (and act?) like teenagers and not like twenty-somethings. I do think the teens (well mostly Seth) put way too much emphasis on sex but for him I think it was mostly a front as the teens do have some depth and ethics. The two cops are hilarious as some of the worst (or coolest?) cops in movie history. I also thought the guy in glasses playing McLovin was very good and believable. It's a movie I would certainly not mind seeing again with friends. I think it would be even better that way. Rating: 8 out of 10",8,3,7,23 May 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Unfortunately generic and uninspired
","It has nice action scenes, although a few were cut too rapidly to follow, and adequate earnest performances from Wolverine (Jackman) and his brother nemesis but overall this felt very average and generic. The story was pedestrian and unengaging (except for the promising start), the dialogs were mostly lame, the music was just there (not really noticeable actually) and although some of the CG effects were decent, a few were weak and noticeable as computer effects (especially the end). The directing was competent but uninspired.Wolverine lacked a certain X factor that would have made me care about him or the secondary characters even though, considering some of the tragedies, I should have. Perhaps it's because you don't see the secondary characters enough on-screen, perhaps it's because their characterization was lacking or perhaps it's because there's too many of them. I won't get started on the many liberties taken over the source material and I tried not to evaluate it based on that. Perhaps by their very nature, prequels cannot be as interesting or suspenseful as the originals because in a way you already know the final result. It felt to me the weakest of the X-Men movie franchise and rather disappointing. I was entertained but barely and I'm not particularly interested in seeing it again anytime soon.Rating: 5.5 out of 10",5,1,4,23 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," British invasion of action comedies starts here! (hopefully)
","Hot fuzz is a pretty darn good comedy about a super city cop transferred against his will to a small village where nothing big ever seems to happen. The super cop in question, played by Simon Pegg, is extremely competent and by the book. I was impressed at how soberly and seriously he was played without a hint of camp in sight. He could have been in any serious cop drama or action flick. The writers could have easily made him a pompous jerk but he didn't come off that way. It's the third time I see Simon Pegg in a movie and to me he's like a chameleon, I can barely recognize him each time so kudos to him. In contrast, you have all the other characters who are a bit off-kilter or eccentric. I liked most of them, particularly Timothy Dalton as a grocery store manager, but I wish the other cops had just a little more character without going into Police Academy territory. I admit having had trouble understanding some of the accents (not counting the old cop that's a joke in itself) but I'm not holding it against the film since most of the writing, with its share of profanity, was so much fun and witty. The cop played by Nick Frost eventually became likable as a slacker trying to emulate and befriend the uptight Simon Pegg. Their chemistry was wonderful and convincing as I suppose it should be since in real life they've been best friends for a long time. So you seem to have the hallmarks of a buddy cop film with a few quirks and wrenches added for spice.The directing was certainly above-par and creative. I was constantly amused by how seemingly innocuous mundane actions were made so very exciting through the cutting and sound effects. Let's mention the few surprising bloody moments that certainly reminded me of Shaun of the Dead. Not everyone will like them but I did. I found most of the jokes quite funny, although not laugh-out-loud material until the hilarious last act. That last act was just so unexpected yet logical, with such a dramatic yet comedic escalation (yes both together), that it makes you feel jubilation as it goes on. It's just very satisfying and I appreciated very much how the super cop tried to handle everything while staying true to his beliefs. A typical American buddy cop film would have made him much less 'subtle', therefore evacuating the comedy, and would have tacked on an unnecessary love interest. Hot Fuzz seems almost like a double-headed beast since it embraces its fair lot of action film clichés while subverting them and since it's both a spoof and a homage. In final analysis though, it's just a great mix of action and comedy.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,2,4,29 May 2009
Troy," Well done epic mix between historical and fantasy movie
","Let's not care too much about how accurate it is to the myth (probably very little) and enjoy it for its own merits. If you want a big budget pseudo-historical movie with epic battles (although far from the best), gripping duels, charismatic heroes, tragedy and romance, this should fit the bill nicely. I very much liked the twists (although there's one anybody should already know ;) and the characters who, surprisingly for this type of film, were for the most part multidimensional and not without their flaws/redeeming factors on both sides of the conflict. It's just too bad that the gods were mostly evacuated from the story (with one possible exception) but then it might have hurt the rest of the character development too much. I was entertained and somewhat impressed despite my initial misgivings. It's worth renting or purchasingRating: 8 out of 10",8,1,3,24 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Acceptable sequel lacking emotional impact
","Finally, we get a Terminator movie that explores what happens during the actual war between the machines and the humans, a movie taking place during the apocalyptic glimpses seen in previous films. Was it properly exploited? Read on to find out.The action scenes were decent but were sometimes difficult to follow being victims of shaky camera-itis. Maybe it's just me but I didn't find them very thrilling either except for a few. Props to the helicopter crash scene from the pilot's perspective though. The visual effects were of high quality and the terminators never looked so good with a bigger variety than ever before although I'm still not sure about the moto terminator concept. For what might seem like more primitive terminators (in Los Angeles), please consider that the terminators seen in other films were from farther into the future. The sound effects were quite good especially the thuds from the bigger machines. Storywise, I found the plot had a few great ideas that weren't satisfactorily explored or explained, particularly Marcus' past and why the terminators started taking human prisoners instead of continuing to exterminate them. They didn't show us what actually happened and it felt like a missed opportunity. Certain plot elements didn't seem to make sense at the time and it bugged me throughout. I thought I was being difficult but after reading a few of the lower-rated reviews, I do indeed see there are major plot holes (especially involving Kyle Reese). More importantly, certain moments lacked the dramatic or emotional impact they should have had. In particular, there's a cool moment near the end I cannot specifically mention where you think to yourself 'holy crap! did they actually do this!' only to be drastically minimized just afterwards (you thinking, 'how lame') and then brought back later in a different location when the dramatic impact was already defused. The finale, which should have been heart-wrenching, simply flat-lined on an emotional level. The dialogs were mostly lackluster and seemed to like stating the obvious (Evasive maneuvers!). I liked the characters of Kyle Reese and Marcus and thought they were played well but although Christian Bale was his usual intense self, he didn't portray the quieter moments convincingly. He seemed one-dimensional. Visually, the colors seemed bleached out making everything look grittier and gloomier. I understand the reason why but I didn't particularly care for it. The production design and settings were OK but weren't particularly original or memorable (nowhere near the skull-covered grounds of previous films). I was also disappointed at the lack of full-scale military engagements between machine and human. The actual 'war' you might have expected from trailers was not really shown, it was mostly skirmishes or duels. Overall though, it's a good sequel lacking the heart and emotional core of the others. If you've seen the previous films, you'll want to see this, perhaps not worth full price in theaters, but try not to think too hard about logical inconsistencies and to enjoy the action/visual effects for their own sake. If you haven't seen the previous films, you might be lost and I would recommend watching at least one Terminator film before (I would say Terminator 2, the highlight of the series).

500 Days of Summer," Refreshing unconventional indie romantic comedy
","What a nice surprise this was. A refreshing somewhat off-kilter romantic comedy about a hopeless romantic believing in one true love who falls for Summer, the girl who doesn't believe in the concept of love at all and even less in conventional labels. Yet she likes him and they do have a form of relationship. The narrative structure is peculiar going back and forth in non-chronological order during 500 days, of what? I won't tell you. It makes for some fun storytelling showing contrasts before and after certain events. There are some interesting visual finds (such as the split screen between expectations and reality, and the city fading) but overall it's rather conventional in terms of cinematography with 'actors staring straight at the camera' shots being used a fair bit. The writing was at times quite clever and other times sounded realistic and sincere. I loved the narrator who added both seriousness and whimsy to the proceedings. I didn't care for the product placement of Ikea but I suppose it gives instant recognition as to what type of store it is. The audience I was with really responded to the movie: laughing, sighing and seeming to have a great time. I also enjoyed myself and smiled often. There are some really funny amusing scenes in this flick. The two leads were quite charming, enthusiastic and had a wonderful chemistry. He's been acting since he was a kid but I predict great things for Joseph Gordon Levitt as a leading man. As for Zooey Deschanel as Summer, she has the cool girl next door appeal with something extra that makes her somewhat unattainable yet hard to resist or dislike. She's not bad, she's just honest and doesn't seem to believe in love. The enjoyable secondary characters didn't have big roles but most did have a shining moment with my favorite secondary character being the mature insightful-beyond-her-years younger sister of the main character. The ending seemed a bit forced to me although clever. It could have been better although it does kinda make things come full circle. Actually, watching this again much later on DVD, I think it's close to a perfect ending and it's certainly memorable. I was also forgetting to mention the very nice choice of songs from the likes of Regina Spektor, the Smiths and other cool acts. I see I'm being rather critical but overall I really enjoyed 500 Days of Summer and the more I talked to it with my friend, the more it made me want to see it again. I could see this film gaining a cult following or being a sleeper hit. It's definitely worth watching preferably with someone of the opposite sex, whether you're romantically involved or not.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,1,4,5 August 2009
The Terminator," Review from first-time watcher after seeing Terminator Salvation
","I had seen numbers 2 and 3 of the series but not this one and so was interested in going back to the origins after watching the latest installment. I understand now why it was critically praised and strong enough to launch a franchise. It also helped very much into understanding some aspects of the last film. Actually, the first Terminator struck me at how internally logical it was in its fictional concept which is not an easy thing to do considering the inherent pratfalls whenever time travel is involved. It just consistently made sense compared to the plot holes of Salvation.The action was obviously much lower-budget but it felt right and it looked good. The director James Cameron filmed some very effective stunts that still hold up today. You could always tell what was going on and follow the action. The terminator was an imposing menacing presence. Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role played it without showing any emotion (which makes sense) while his massive physique, ponderous movements and plastic looks (he does look artificial sometimes!) sell the character. You could nitpick that the head of Arnold was obviously replaced by a fake head sometimes (mirror scene) but weirdly it kinda worked anyway into making him more creepy. The other main roles, Sarah Connor and Reese, were played just right showing enough emotion without going into overexagerated melodrama. They were believable and likable. When reviews of Salvation complain about lack of heart, you get it more when you see the characterizations and character development here (even more so after Terminator 2).Since I already knew most of the twists, from having seen the later movies, it is difficult for me to comment on them. However, I must say they were well implemented and must surely have been effective back then. The story was quite interesting and the glimpses of the future were particularly engrossing. The soundtrack sometimes seemed a bit weak with the synthesizers but one should see it as a 'time capsule' of the eighties (time the movie takes place and when it was filmed) and basically it fits with the haircuts and wardrobes of the time. It's worth a rental as a piece of sci-fi action history or a purchase if you're a James Cameron, Schwarzenegger or Terminator fan. Be careful of which edition you get as some versions with extras do exist. Rating: 8 out of 10",8,1,3,4 June 2009
Silent Hill," Surrealist and creepy 'haunted town' tale
","You might learn that this supernatural thriller comes from a video game but don't let it stop you from watching it. It's an adaptation that's actually decent and that works very well as a serious horror film. How did they manage that rare feat? It might be because they hired a talented french director (he did Brotherhood of the Wolf which you should see) who loved the original material and actually found it frightening (which it is). He even had to woo the notoriously protective Japanese producers (Konami) for years to be accepted. The guy was dedicated and he shoots some hellishly beautiful scenes. It might be because the story is engrossing and mysterious. It might be because the mostly unknown actresses (mostly a female cast in the major roles) play it very well and seriously.It might be because the creatures are genuinely creepy and disturbing. I would say they're original and never seen before but actually most of them are concepts from the games brought to life. They were so good I thought they were computer-made but actually it's mostly actors, actually professional dancers, in suits and makeup. And let me tell you having dancers makes a huge difference in terms of having great creature movements that push them a notch above. It might be because it relies more on unnerving atmosphere, nightmarish visuals, dreamlike quality than jump surprises and gore for its scares. Mostly it might be so good because Silent Hill changed stuff but kept the spirit of the games (yes, that's a good thing). Silent Hill is no Resident Evil for those unfamiliar so don't expect zombies or something similar. Some might have issues with the actions of the main character at the start before going into the town. I did too but then I thought about it (the day after) and realized she was doing this against her husband's will as a last ditch attempt to help her daughter. Still... it's a bit reckless and irrational. The other thing that might bug and confuse viewers is that Silent Hill leaves you with questions unanswered. Personally, I like that type of story where they do explain a lot but don't neatly tie up everything. The ending will certainly make you think and second guess. The film itself might even warrant a second viewing for better understanding. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of everything here. It should please horror fans whether or not they're fans of the games provided they watch it with an open mind not expecting their standard American slasher fest.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,7,10,19 September 2009
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Using dark humor to convey messages
","It's an influential Kubrick movie any serious film buff should see even though like me you've probably seen the infamous bomb sequence before out of context, ruining a bit, but not all, of the ending. This is one of the best dark political comedies out there. It has great lines, strong performances and Peter Sellers was tremendous in his very different roles. His character Dr. Strangelove has little screen time but is pure comic genius. The other standout was the general played by George C. Scott. I think no matter how much time passes, this will always be a cautionary tale about absurdity, the military and blind patriotism. Rating: 8 out of 10",8,1,4,24 May 2009
Blade II," Slick vampiric action
","Technically and visually, it's awesome. The director is great at making action look cool. The fight scenes are fast, sharp and exciting, probably helped a lot by the choreography of Donnie Yen (although he was not alone). The actors were obviously replaced by computer graphics a few times but it's not too bad. One of the best parts of the film is the blood pack, a team of vampires. They might not be developed very much but they have killer looks and moves. The story had a promising concept, a new strain of vampires hunting traditional vampires, and their design was very good and creepy, especially the mouth. However, the action eclipses the story by a fair margin and there's not much plot development nor is it likely you will care much about the few dramatic elements. Wesley Snipes as Blade shows amazing physical prowess but almost always wearing his dark glasses is almost as stoic as Arnold in the Terminator movies. This is interesting to see as a stepping stone for talented director Del Toro's future projects: the 2 Hellboys and Pan's Labyrinth. It's also a decent sequel to the first Blade without as much character development but stronger action and visual design. It's worth a rental and perhaps a buy if you're a Benicio Del Toro's or Blade fan. It's leagues above the rather poor third installment and it's where you see how much a director makes the difference.Rating: 6.5 out of 10",7,1,2,17 July 2009
Knocked Up," Didn't knock it out of the park but was amusing enough
","Say what you will about writer/director Judd Apatow but beyond the raunchy, crude and drug humor usually seen in his comedies, there's usually also a lot of heart and honesty. That guy might even be a closet romantic for all we know. I didn't like 'Knocked up' as much as his other efforts (40 year-old virgin, Superbad, etc) but I did have a good time watching it. I found it often amusing but rarely hilarious. The premise of a poor overweight average-looking slacker impregnating the hot ambitious successful blonde could be material for lots of dumb easy jokes but it does manage to make the average guy (Seth Rogen) likable in an earnest childish way and we do see how the blonde (Katherine Heigl) in question might not dismiss him right out the bat. This being an American comedy, I kind of expected abortion not to be brought up at all but I was pleasantly surprised at how tastefully it was talked about. The humor does rely on clever dialog and the differences between this ill-assorted pair, more specifically on how unsophisticated and irresponsible Seth Rogen seems to be. In one of the funniest scenes, he explains what he does for a living in a totally honest non self-conscious way while the audience and the blonde roll their eyes.Seth's character also has a bunch of slacker roommates who do help raise the raunchy pop-culture humor level. However, as much as I liked the running joke with the beard, I thought 2 of the friends in question (the bearded guy and the mustache guy) lacked on-screen presence and charisma (although I know they're not supposed to be charismatic). Heigl in the leading female role was natural and charming playing as the straight (wo)man role to Rogen's funny man. The chemistry between them was good and I did enjoy their character development. The women (thinking specifically of Heigl's sister here) might seem like prudish snobbish killjoys but I think it contrasts well with the immature fun-loving boys and does add a certain dramatic element and insight on modern men-women relationships. There were some complaints that the film was sexist towards women but really I would argue it's the guys who are not portrayed flatteringly. Weirdly, this movie is a paradox: a somewhat moral honest modern 'romantic' comedy hidden under a raunchy immature slacker comedy.Rating: 6.5 out of 10",7,1,2,11 June 2009
Alien," Chilling psychological sci-fi classic still great today
","Maybe not as powerful and surprising today because we've become used to that kind of film (becaused copied so many times) but back then it was very fresh and surely terrifying. The tempo is slow but it works in context and contributes to create suspense and intensify surprises. The atmosphere and visual design are great and still look fine in the 21st century (with a couple of exceptions: one being a particular 'head'). The premise of the film was like a B-movie but everything was done to make it a quality A-movie including the actors who play seriously without any 'camp' factor. Sigourney Weaver, in her first movie role, created a standard for strong female heroes that was extremely rare in those days. The alien creature as designed by Giger was a stroke of nightmarish genius recognizable and memorable amongst all others. It was even more effective because it was glimpsed so quickly and infrequently. Alien and the sequel Aliens have influenced tons of films and video games afterwards, especially visually. It's certainly a classic in the sci-fi thriller genre and should be seen by everyone. How I wish I could have seen it back in its heyday, but then perhaps I would have been psychologically scarred forever by its chilling images ;-) Rating: A strong 8 out of 10",8,1,3,27 May 2009
Lost in Translation," Great minimalist tale about Americans in modern Japan
","I admit that I initially thought this movie might have been overrated. Turns out that I was fascinated by the modern Japan setting, how it was filmed and several other things. I couldn't stop myself from smiling at several moments. I think a lot of the humor works because it's in the subtext, not obvious. The leads are smart, you can guess what they're thinking and cannot say. Bill Murray was perfect, Scarlett Johansson was charming (I think it's the role where I found her the best) and the chemistry between them was great to behold. It's a minimalist story but all the ingredients are mixed just right.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,1,2,24 May 2009
Interstellar," Short review for a long film
","I'm glad I saw this in Imax as it was really worth seeing on the biggest screen possible. The epic story was well told and sometimes gripping. Cinematography was very good except for overuse of that one angle where you see the prow of the lander ship. Space vistas themselves could have been more impressive as it seems digital effects were intentionally limited. The surfaces of planets and phenomenas compensate. Excellent acting all-around with McConaughey the highlight, except he was sometimes hard to understand. The sound effect work and especially the stirring music were awesome. It was more emotional than Nolan's previous films, yet I didn't tear up. Your final appreciation will likely depend on what you think of the ending.",8,1,5,16 December 2014
Pacific Rim," Modern Giant robots vs Godzillas?
","I can't believe this actually got financed and made. It's like a geek boy's dream and it has no big name actors. You basically have giant monster-beasts coming out through a dimensional breach in the Pacific Ocean (hence the title), trying to destroy a world that fights back by uniting and creating giant robots (or mecha) piloted by humans. The war seems to be mostly won because of these until new, more dangerous monsters start coming out years later at a faster frequency. At that time, only a few giant robots remain in fighting shape, the rest being destroyed or decommissioned, with less than a dozen pilots remaining. The end is near unless something drastic happens.So, most people will want to watch this because of the spectacular giant robots versus giant monsters fights, and it certainly delivers, but with some caveats. The monsters look great, even real, and not corny at all as in most Godzilla-type movies (no rubber suit here). However, near the end, they become harder to differentiate and I didn't always know who was who. They changed the red blood to some blue glow-in-the-dark blood. The monsters being alien, it makes sense and avoids making things too bloody. The monsters lack personality and are just portrayed as destructive beasts, but I won't hold that against the creators. The robots look cool and have an imposing physical presence despite the near-constant avoidance of showing them next to humans for scale. They didn't look that much computer-generated to me although I knew they were. The robots and monsters looked their size (massive) because of their ponderous, slower than real-life movements, as well as the sound effects that were excellent. The fights themselves were enjoyable and didn't overstay their welcome. I didn't suffer from action fatigue as when fights last too long without real stakes. However, because of close-ups, fast editing and lots of rain, it wasn't always clear what was going on, so the action could have been better. I did love it though.Story-wise, the creators do provide an explanation that makes some sense for this monster invasion. I would even quality the story as interesting although a bit predictable although the accents were sometimes difficult to understand. It's a shame most of the secondary characters were not really developed because they looked interesting. One of my most memorable moments involved a 'flashback' involving a little girl running away from a giant monster (she acted so well). Acting was acceptable with the highlight being Idris Elba as the Marshall. Most emotional dramatic moments unfortunately did not really connect with me except for the stuff involving the Marshall and the Japanese woman. The b-story involving 2 eccentric scientists wasn't really great, nor was it particularly funny although it tried to. It was good for a change of pace though.For some realistic, amazing-looking 'live-action' giant robot versus giant monsters that don't look fake, this is great stuff. It doesn't look cartoony, it's not corny and you don't need to be a total geek to enjoy it. Don't watch if you're allergic to the subject matter though. I'm a geek and I probably liked the movie more because it reminded me of some great mecha anime (such as Neon Genesis Evangelion) without really looking like it.Rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)",6,1,6,17 July 2013
Watchmen," Powerful and complex, definitely not your typical super-hero movie
","I'm wondering whether I should restrain my enthusiasm for fear of raising expectations too much for potential viewers. Keep in mind that Watchmen got mixed reviews and that it's not for everyone. I'm a huge fan of the original graphic novel, I had my doubts but this movie really impressed me. The director probably did the best adaptation that could have been done and I still wonder how he got away with it, how it did not get more 'hollywoodized' in a negative sense. Throughout the projection, I was in awe at the world that was created and any negative aspect I could find here (because no it isn't perfect) would be nitpicking (one of them being the choice of music during the owl ship scene in a soundtrack which I otherwise found quite good). Watchmen is great in so many ways: rich in plot, visually stunning, smart, original, philosophical food for thought, shocking unpredictable twists (for those who didn't read the book), exciting action scenes, very good performances and memorable anti-hero characters (especially Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan) to name a few highlights.It's far from your typical super-hero movie; it's a bold, dark, complex and magnificent of work that will certainly become a cult film if not the masterpiece of the director Zak Snyder whether or not it's a financial success. The opening montage showing the history of this alternate world where costumed heroes appeared is not only useful but bloody brilliant and deserves special recognition if not an award of some sort. The storyline itself is fascinating and very well told through layers of flashbacks and a personal journal (heard as the narrator) while also being a murder mystery. More interesting though are the characters themselves, portraits of what multi-faceted costumed 'heroes' might be like in the 'real' world. You might not like them but you'll likely find them interesting. Some might find the film meandering, confusing and too long but to me it's because there's so much good material and there's no way you can catch everything with just one viewing (another incentive to get the DVD). From a cinematography point of view, it's a wonder with amazing camera work, brutal yet graceful action choreography and atmospheric set designs. It's peppered with beautiful visual signatures (the first being the iconic smiley face in the puddle) that often are hommages to comic book panels.I only hope that this film and Dark Knight (which I also loved) doesn't usher in a tidal wave of super-hero movies that are dark, gritty, violent without the depth, heart and ambiguity that makes them work, especially for characters that should not be as dark (like Superman!). This negative influence happened to the comics after Watchmen and the Dark Knight returns were published in the mid-eighties... (by the way Dark Knight Returns is about Batman but has nothing to do with the movie Dark Knight except perhaps they're both for mature audiences) There are a few warnings to go with my praise though. If you're allergic to graphical violence (there's a few quick gory scenes), expect something similar to Spider-Man or Batman, want something family-friendly, want typical 'super-heroes' (notice the quotation marks) or can't get beyond seeing a blue penis (which by the way is faithful to the graphic novel), then you won't like Watchmen. If you want to see an original intelligent dramatic superhero action film and excellent adaptation of a seminal work in the comic book medium (originally published in 1986-87) that was extremely influential and changed the perception of what super-hero stories could achieve, then you might like it. You don't need to read the book to appreciate the movie but you'll appreciate and understand it more if you do read it either before or after (I would suggest after so the movie is more visceral and surprising to you). The movie is self-contained and will not have sequels. It's definitely worth getting but choose your edition carefully so you don't end up buying it twice and encouraging the publisher's money grabbing.

28 Weeks Later," Nice surprise: as good if not better than 28 days
","Gripping and intense, your mileage might vary but I think I preferred this one to the original which was already pretty great. As a matter of fact, 28 weeks could theoretically be seen first since it's 2 different stories with different characters. The camera work is nervous and bold yet keeps similar aesthetics to 28 days even though it's made by a different director. The storyline was very suspenseful filled with powerful moments and difficult moral decisions.It's also quite thought-provoking regarding the American military. Some might think, even me at first, that some plot elements are illogical or too coincidental but when you think about it, you realize that most of it can be explained. Just keep in mind that the infection might have evolved.",9,2,4,23 May 2009
Knowing," Knowing how well the movie turned out without spoilers
","I thought the concept was great, the implementation was interesting, but in the end the reason for that prophetic document was far fetched and didn't make sense. Initially, I was quite engrossed by the movie and thought it might pleasantly surprise me (I didn't expect much from a relatively recent Nicolas Cage movie). I thought the mystery aspect was well built-up. The performance by Cage was better than usual, but then he's usually good at acting quietly depressed. The first disaster sequences were amazing not only in their intensity, but in the way they were shot. That first one involving a plane crash in a sequence of roughly 3 minutes with not cuts was viscerally gripping as if you were really there.Unfortunately, the movie fell apart in the last quarter because of a few things. The aforementioned revelations were certainly shocking, but why were they made in that indirect, stupid, relying-on-luck-and-finding-someone-smart-enough way (document lost in time capsule for 50 years) when they could have easily been made directly to the people involved? It's not as if the responsible parties weren't around all those years! One might argue there couldn't have been a movie then, but whenever I try to think too much about common sense logic, the plot doesn't make sense. Characters also started acting irrationally. Considering what was happening, this might be excused. What cannot be excused however is how poor the acting by the modern kids was. I had already noticed how unemotional the main boy and girl were, but their seriously lacking 'emoting' near the end basically ruined any emotional connection with me, the public, there should have been. Even Cage, more believable, could save that climactic moment.So despite an initially thrilling slow-paced mystery with exciting, yet short, disasters sequences, the film didn't work for me intellectually or emotionally. It's also a case of a lousy ending (and no, it's not because of the tone) ruining the rest. For the first three quarters of the film, I would rate it a 7 or 8. The last quarter I would rate a 3 or 4. I cut the apple in half for my final rating.Rating: 5.5 out of 10 (average-good)",6,1,3,20 November 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Fine sequel not up to Cameron's previous efforts
","Terminator 3 (T3) often gets a bad rep but I think it's caused more by the greatness of T2 and how it was difficult if not impossible to beat. I didn't like how Skynet was still active even after the events of T2, it seemed to negate most sacrifices made by the protagonist and to slap the director James Cameron's work in the face (shades of Alien 3 here). However, without that, there wouldn't have been a T3 so I would have been quite satisfied if a simple explanation had been given. As it is, I had to check Wikipedia for that. The new director straddles a fine line between rip-offs and homages having at first trouble finding its own voice. It didn't feel as exciting and fresh as T2. The plot and directing were good but not as inspired as T2 either.The terminatrix was not as good a villain as the T-1000, something was missing. Arnold was still in fine form but did look older than previous films (which is unavoidable I guess ;). The actors playing Connor and Kate Brewster were quite good. The first chase scene felt a bit overlong but you've got to admire the stunt work and I don't remember that kind of truck being used in a chase before. The film and action does pick up in the second half making it more suspenseful. I loved the fight between the Terminator and the Terminatrix when they were bashing walls. I thought that was great. I also loved the bold ending very much as it's kind of surprising while also closing the big loop hole left at the end of T2. Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit, more in the second half than the first. It's worth renting or purchasing if you're a action sci-fi or Terminator collector.Rating: 7 out of 10",7,1,2,9 June 2009
The Orphanage," Ordinary name for unorthodox film
","I watched it not quite knowing what to expect. It's not conventional horror. I would describe it as a mix of family drama and psychological supernatural suspense. The closest movie it made me think of was The Others with Nicole Kidman, but it's suitably different. It also reminded me a bit of M. Night Shymalyan's early films. In short, an orphan girl adopted at young age, goes back to live at her old orphanage, recently purchased, with her husband and son. Her memories there are happy, and she plans to start a new life taking care of handicapped kids in that place. Her son has imaginary friends, but he starts making new ones once he arrives at the new house. He plays strange games, a creepy little kid with a cloth bag on his head starts appearing, and then eventually the son vanishes.The rest of the film is mostly the desperate quest of her mother to find him, while also discovering secrets of her own about the orphanage. I thought the film had pretty good tense moments without relying on cheap jump scares. The directing doesn't draw much attention to itself, but I thought it was nicely done and visually stimulating, even in the several moments where nothing much seemed to happen, moments that could have been boring in a less-talented directors's hands. It's a slow-boiler though and the things you don't see can be the creepiest. Memorable moments include a discussion in bed and a children's game variation on hide and seek. In fact, the discoveries and unmasking of the truth were always highlights.I liked how things were not always obvious and how it made me think. The clever ending was surprising and memorable, as well as open to interpretation depending on how optimistic or somber you are. The acting by the female lead was believable, you could feel her anguish, and she didn't look like the typical, perfect Hollywood actress, in fact she looked older than her actual age. I could see afterwards why Guillermo Del Toro was interested in the project. It's right up the alley of what interests him with seemingly innocent kids, the power of imagination, wondrous moments, mysteries and a dash of scariness. I think it's worth watching provided you don't expect straight standard horror.Rating: 7 out of 10 (Very good)",7,2,5,17 March 2012
Wanted," Guilty pleasure
","Wanted is a guilty pleasure for me. It's amoral, rather superficial but so much fun and stylish with a good plot, a few big surprises and really thrilling action scenes. There's stuff in this film that I've never seen anywhere else. I found it bold, dynamic and original. Keep in mind that I'm not judging it based on the comic books source material. I understand the two are quite different and I might have been miffed at the liberties taken if I had read them. Regarding the plot, the only thing I really have some issue with would be a special loom but I got beyond it. Wanted is a great action movie with some fantastical elements that enhance the wow factor. Just don't take it too seriously or think too much about all the victims of the collateral damage. Oh what the heck, since I was so enthusiastic after seeing it for the first time (which rarely happens) I'm going to give it another half star. It's worth purchasing as it's very spectacular and re-watchable.Rating: 8.5 out of 10P.S.: Since this original review, I read the graphic novel that inspired the movie adaptation. The graphic novel and the the movie are two completely different beasts that are extremely loosely connected. I've rarely seen such drastic changes in terms of story, characters and settings, heck practically everything. Purists of the graphic novel will be sorely disappointed unless they can view the movie as a separate entity.",9,1,2,27 May 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The best Terminator in every regard
","After watching every Terminator movie, I can honestly say this one is the best: a sequel that surpasses the original, the landmark that sequels are compared to. The plot is tight, logical and constantly surprises you (compare to the plot problems in Terminator Salvation). T2 can even be seen before all others as I did many years ago as it stands by itself. The cinematography and camera shots are beautiful. Notice the color schemes particularly in the asylum (blue-gray) and the foundry (orange-red). The 'visions' scenes are very inspired and memorable. The action is intense, engrossing and escalating as it should be. The visual effects are very impressive and were revolutionary back then, especially anything involving the T-1000. The actors are top-notch particularly Linda Hamilton who shines in the strong yet fragile, tough yet conflicted Sarah Connor, the role of her life.The terminators, supposed to be unemotional, are quite cool, menacing and relentless yet fascinating. The interactions between John Connor and the terminator are wonderful and add depth to both characters. After seeing T2 for the first time, I was so awed by Robert Patrick's performance that I kept looking for him in other movies. Everything is in the physicality and the deliberate movements with no small nod to the talents of the director. Compare the T-1000 to the terminatrix in T3 who for some reason was much less memorable. The music is much better and grandiose than the first (such a good percussive theme) and the sound effects are so good they won 2 academy awards. Let's finish by mentioning the powerful unforgettable ending that is not only moving but ties up neatly the loose ends. There's actually something big that does not make sense (darn time travel paradoxes) but even after seeing T2 more than once, it just doesn't bug you when you actually watch the film. It's definitely worth buying but be careful with the different DVD editions. Rating: 9 out of 10",9,5,7,9 June 2009
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Liked the concept and singing but the humor mostly didn't work
","Here's something you don't see every day: a parody of a music biopic, well in this case most of the recent ones but mostly Walk the Line depicting Johnny Cash. I found the lead's performance was quite good and was impressed at his singing ability (pretty sure the actor sings everything). I also liked his evolution through different time periods. However, the humor mostly fell flat for me and the running gags weren't even particularly funny. For example: the names of the famous celebrities he invariably encounters being repeated over and over. What did work better were the sexual innuendo jokes, especially the duet. Most of the best jokes are in the trailer that makes the movie look much better than it actually is. I think big American music fans from the fifties up to the eighties would get a lot more from Dewey Cox with all the references and inside jokes. The extras on the second disc are unbelievably good and funnier than most of the original movie. It almost made me think the movie deserved a better review and rating than I gave it.

Disturbia," Do NOT watch the trailer before watching the movie
","Because it's a case of the trailer basically telling you the whole plot which is very bad especially in the case of a thriller. In case you didn't know, this is a remake with modern technological trappings (cell phone, hand-held camera, computer, etc) of an old 1954 Hitchcock thriller called Rear Window. I haven't seen the original so cannot compare. I found Disturbia to be a good little teen movie/suspense thriller, little in terms of scope and surprises. Yes for me, it was a bit predictable even though I didn't watch the trailer. The concept of the guy under house arrest spying on his neighbours to pass the time and potentially discovering something disturbing is somewhat interesting but didn't feel fully exploited. The first third of the movie is fun and is more like a teen movie about a boy being grounded all summer. It grounds the characters and the restricted setting.Shia LaBeouf is very good playing an average ordinary joe as he usually is. The second third of the movie starts being more suspenseful as clues point towards one of the neighbours being a potential serial killer unless it's just the teen being paranoid (the french title of the film is Paranoiak btw). The third act I cannot speak about too much, unless to say the trailer reveals way too much. For a suspense, I cannot say I was ever truly afraid although I was surprised a couple of times. I fear Disturbia might have been slightly overrated because it was a surprise commercial success. Box office gross is unfortunately too often associated with movie quality. I did like Disturbia but I was underwhelmed. I would say it's worth a rental but not a purchase because I doubt you'd find it disturbing or intriguing enough to watch twice.Rating: 6 out of 10",6,1,2,17 August 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Good sarcastic fun in glorious 3d
","This movie looked amazing especially in Imax 3d. The textures in particular were great. I liked the monster designs except perhaps for Insectosaur but I would have liked more actual aliens. Beyond the beautiful 3d graphics (which eventually might look dated), it was lots of fun to watch with a few clever in jokes for movie or geek fans. A special mention goes to the president 'talking' to the alien. It did lack some of the heart and magic present in most Pixar films but it did have more fun sarcastic humor and was overall quite entertaining. The simple plot was serviceable except for one particular predictable 'twist' (which kids might not see coming perhaps).Rating: 7 out of 10",7,1,2,23 May 2009
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Potentially nasty concept is both funny and likable
","I was quite prepared to hate this based on the subject alone but the movie actually won me over by banking more on its heart and likable characters and mostly avoiding totally mean jokes. Don't get me wrong, there could be a few jokes considered mean (nothing wrong with that) but mostly the humor revolves around the awkwardness and naiveté of the title character. There are some genuinely funny moments here, especially the physical comedy bits (the 'epilation' scene is comic genius).The lead, Steve Carell, was a revelation. He's low-key and understated and the fact he doesn't chew the scenery or overact (like Jim Carrey could have) helps make his character not only believable but likable. Some of the situations will certainly remind us guys of our beginnings in the love/sex department so it's very relatable. There might be even be a few love insights for most of us as a bonus. This was overall a great surprise for me and contrary to some over-hyped fluff, this one quite deserved its popularity. One of the best comedies I've ever seen and well worth buying.Rating: 9 out of 10",9,2,4,23 May 2009
Shrek Forever After," Shrek's Wonderful Life gone forever more ?
","I must be either growing too old for this or this seems like the weakest entry in the Shrek film franchise. Don't get me wrong, it's OK, most of the characters we love are in there, but it feels less inspired. It's as if some of the magic was gone. My mind wandered a few times especially during the action scenes. I smiled a few times but I didn't laugh out loud like in the others. The best joke was a recycled one from previous instalments. To be fair, the audience laughed at regular intervals but nothing crazy like at the best comedies. The jabs at popular culture, political correctness and Disney in particular seemed to be mostly absent. The new characters weren't as memorable as the ones previously introduced. Then again, it's really tough to beat Donkey and Puss'n'Boots for sheer enjoyment. As a matter of fact, the moments involving them were the ones I preferred. The actors voicing them were in fine enthusiastic form. Mike Myers as Shrek was equal to himself, complete with slightly annoying Scottish accent. The 3D animation (in actual 3D with glasses this time) was nice looking, dynamic but didn't blow me away. The story lacks a bit of suspense because it's basically an alternate universe story if Shrek's involvement in important matters had changed, somewhat similar to the movie 'It's a Wonderful Life' (was that vague enough ? ;-). Throughout the film, you keep thinking things cannot stay that way because it would invalidate the 3 previous films but you don't care very much about that because Shrek is more about fun than mortal danger. I admit that at some point it was clever how the 'easy' solution was avoided prolonging the shenanigans. Some good humor is found in the new first meetings between Shrek and old friends who don't remember him. Some of the humor falls a bit flat. The movie does have some heart and touching moments. All in all, the supposedly last Shrek movie is watchable and pleasant enough but fails to impress. It also pales compared to previous efforts (ok, not so much compared to the third that a few will argue is worse). If I lowered your expectations just a little, then you can thank me later when you're pleasantly surprised watching this entertaining film ... :-)Rating : 6 out of 10 (good)",6,2,6,25 May 2010
Aliens," One of the most influential sci-fi action thrillers of all time
","It's a different genre than the first film (action thriller instead of psychological suspense, both with sci-fi trappings) but it just works very very well. The space marines were a hoot and their interactions were quite fun. The creatures were also much better done than in the first film with a special mention to the new one at the end (one of the all-time great). For me, this sequel was more fun to watch, way more action-packed, generally more thrilling although it didn't have the novelty factor of the first film. The visual design was simply outstanding. It was a very influential film especially for video games in terms of plot, aesthetics, characters and creatures (Doom, Half-Life, Gears of Wars to name a few), probably more so than the first Alien.

Tropic Thunder," Full metal platoon apocalypse on the river Kwai
","From the previews, I expected something much funnier but it's funny enough in certain places. From the fake trailers to the big action opening sequence, it opens up with a bang only to dip down not along after the actors enter the real jungle. Call me sick but I liked the gross-out humour parts reminding me of Monty Python sometimes. I also liked the constant profanity. The best acting and funniest bits probably come from Tom Cruise disguised as an unrecognizable foul-mouthed movie producer. Robert Downey Jr playing the black sergeant manages to do quite well and is probably the coolest character so I doubt he'll offend black people even though he's white. The interactions between him and the real black guy could have been stronger and funnier though.Ben Stiller has some funny bits but the whole retarded Simple Jack routine wears thin really fast. Jack Black is the weakest link providing much manic energy but very little in terms of acting skill or actually funny comedy. He's the most caricatural one-dimensional and annoying of the bunch. I'm not a huge fan of war movies but even I caught a few references so war movie buffs should have a ball. So in the end, Tropic Thunder was hit and miss for me. Comedies making fun of war and primadonna self-involved actors are few and far between so if those subjects appeal to you, then a rental is worthwhile.Rating: 6 out of 10",6,2,3,31 August 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Fresh, hyper-kinetic and just plain fun
","I don't think a movie's quality should be correlated to box office success so I don't care one bit if Scott Pilgrim was a commercial failure. It's still a bold, inventive and very fun film to watch. I'm probably part of the target audience for Scott Pilgrim : male video gamer, geek and in his thirties. That being said, I don't think Scott Pilgrim will appeal only to us. Younger people and especially women will likely love it. Witness the characters who are in their late teens/early twenties yet are much too young to have known the old 8-bit games from the Nintendo Entertainment System era in their heyday (mid-1980s). It bugged me a little, but it's a very minor point. Most of the characters are also cool geeks and far from stereotypical nerds : they're part of indie rock bands or fans, not wearing glasses, more charmingly witty than socially awkward, and more often that not, amazing fighters.This film is a very unconventional action/romance/comedy with strong pop culture sensibilities (video games, comics and mangas mostly). I don't think I've ever experienced something quite like this in cinema, so weirdly it gets major points for originality despite being riddled with references. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. It was a blast to watch and listen to. Visually, it's extremely fresh and dynamic with most sound effects being written on-screen like on a comics page. It might seem annoying, but it worked very well. It has lots of quick cuts (some of the funnier bits coming from stuff appearing out of the blue after a cut) yet everything is easily followable. The fights in particular were very very cool, exciting and spectacular (for geeks : more graceful like Soul Calibur 3 than static like Mortal Kombat). A big part of the humor comes from the one-liners and friendly (or not) banter. It succeeds in doing something very difficult : using intentionally corny lines, bad puns and, by delivery and context, making them sound witty or funny instead of dumb and trite.I think it's my favorite role by Michael Cera, who inhabits that kind of nice, witty, slightly awkward, geek-chic role better than most. But I think the secondary characters are wonderful too and sometimes even steal the show. I loved most of them, especially the very likable and enthusiastic 17-year old Asian girlfriend (so likable you feel sorry and/or root for her) and the wise and promiscuous gay roommate. The main love interest and object of Pilgrim's quest is suitably enigmatic and fascinating. It shows she has baggage and is rather melancholy (almost never smiling). In a brilliant bit of casting, you also get the guys playing Superman (Brandon Routh) and the Human Torch/future Captain America (Chris Evans) as evil ex-boyfriends. I don't know if it's just me but I noticed that eyes in Pilgrim seemed bigger than normal, almost like manga eyes. Kudos to makeup (or special effects ?) for that. The flashbacks with actual drawings from the Scott Pilgrim comics I didn't like as much. They seemed a little out of place, a bit jarring. Scott Pilgrim was a success at entertaining and surprising me constantly. The action was better than expected, the humor was funny, the characters were a joy, the visuals were astounding and the writing was smart. The romantic aspects could have been a bit better, more touching, but were still quite enjoyable. All the geek references were icing on the cake.Rating : 8.5 out of 10 (remarkable)",9,5,17,3 September 2010
The Butterfly Effect," Weird and off-beat: definitely not the usual Ashton Kutcher film
","I'm a sucker for this kind of weird off-beat tale with an original fantastical concept, mysteries, repressed memories (or dreams), anti-heroes and a not-so-perfect romance (witness the superior and personal favorites Brazil and Eternal Sunshine). So, it was difficult for me not to like this and indeed I did like it but with some reserves. I loved the script and the alternate reality aspect (don't want to say too much). Ashton Kutcher was OK but a stronger actor would have made the film that much better. I preferred the secondary characters and how they changed. My suggestion is not to worry about the explanation of how things happen (because it bugged me) and take it as a super-hero movie (with no super-heroes) where powers are not logically explained. I preferred the ending of the director's cut although it was a bit far-fetched. Rating: 7 out of 10",7,1,3,24 May 2009
No Country for Old Men," It's good but didn't deserve the Oscar for best film
","I respect the technical qualities of the film but I can't say I particularly cared for it. How did it get hyped enough to win the Oscar for best film? I'm really not sure although perhaps because it plays constantly with our expectations and genre conventions but probably mostly because of the killer performance by the killer Javier Bardem. He plays a memorable character and it's probably what people will remember from the film 10 years from now. What also comes to mind is how street smart the main characters are and it does help to make things more convincing instead of always second-guessing the stupid actions of the protagonists in typical movies.Although the parts with the sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) were obviously important (to explain the title of the film for one), I thought they were slow and rather dull (although it's likely a conscious choice to show how it's 'not a country for old men' anymore). The violent scenes were short, tense and felt realistic, sometimes skipped altogether. Like the Texas state where it takes place, the film felt desolate and gritty. I should mention that in several places, including the ending, the brothers Coen went for the unexpected and/or anticlimactic. I generally like surprises but overall the problem with anticlimax is that it rarely leaves you satisfied.Rating: 7 out of 10",7,1,4,23 May 2009
District 9," Refreshing take on human-alien cohabitation
","How refreshing. A smart original sci-fi movie that's not a remake, a sequel or based on anything already existing such as a toy-line. Even better, not only is it suspenseful and unpredictable, it makes you think and serves its fair share of social commentary without hitting you over the head with it. In short, the aliens are here, arrived 20 years ago, but they're not like anything we expected (more like animalistic shrimp-insectoid hybrids) and they're living in a slum in South Africa the nice humans built for them because the aliens couldn't survive on the big giant spaceship that brought them here, nor could they leave Earth. The story is at first told in a faux documentary fashion before becoming more traditional later on yet always quite dynamic. It's amazing to me that this was made by a first-time movie director considering the talent shown.The human cast is unknown, at least in America, so it helps suspension of disbelief and they're good but nowhere near the highlight of the guy playing Wikus (somewhat resembling Christian Bale), the functionary put in charge of relocating the aliens far away from the city. I particularly liked the character development of Wikus and how our perceptions of the aliens change as we go along. I also liked the twists and turns foisted upon us. However, I did not like a particularly stupid decision made by Wikus, under emotional duress to be fair, that at the time seemed only there to create conflict and delay the end of the movie. I think the story is partly so good because in similar circumstances, the reactions of the involved parties could be very much like this.The aliens were extremely well done in terms of looks and movements. It's a thought-provoking movie but it has lots of thrilling action especially in the last part. There are also some gory moments but they're over quickly. The location of the story, South Africa, is brilliant because of all the associations with Appartheid, disinformation and racism. I would say that right now District 9 is overrated on Internet Movie Database but I think it's because people were anxiously waiting for a great original sci-fi movie with some substance. It's certainly not in the top 50 movies of all time but it's probably the best sci-fi movie I've seen in 2009. With a much lower budget, it beats most American blockbusters in terms of enjoyment and satisfaction.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,4,8,30 August 2009
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Had a grand old time
","I haven't really seen much of his other works (except Fantastic Mister Fox and The Royal Tenenbaums that I can't remember) so I can't judge this film compared to his previous ones. I can however judge that I had a grand old time watching Grand Budapest Hotel at the theatre. Stylistically, it was a triumph. It seemed almost every frame was filmed at right angles (90 degrees) - either facing the camera, left profile, right profile, back or from the top - with a few exceptions. I personally don't like when actors talk directly to the camera as so often happens here, but I didn't mind it this time. It even created a weird sense of intimacy. There was also a noticeable amount of rectangles and squares in the meticulously constructed frames with very little camera movement in those frames. It was like a succession of tableaux and, for lack of better expression, geometrically inspired and fascinating. The use of the bright colors, how they matched, was also stupendous, making for gorgeous scenes.So, it is a joy to look at from an artistic and technical point of view, but how about the story and the characters? It takes place in a fictional eastern-European country, probably inspired by Germany, and is mostly a very long flashback. The story revolves around Mr. Gustave, the eccentric but very competent concierge of a luxurious hotel, read general manager, and Zero, a lobby boy of foreign origin. Without going into details, a favoured customer dies, Gustave inherits something important that causes him tons of trouble. Contrary to what one might think, most of the film doesn't take place in the Grand Budapest Hotel. I usually don't like flashbacks, but I enjoyed very much how the outrageous, sometimes ridiculous story was told, even with the narration. However, the plot was mostly a backdrop to introduce a plethora of fun, colorful characters played by very famous actors clearly relishing their roles. Some were played deadly serious, others a little over the top, but what a great cast and very enjoyable acting. Of particular note were Ralph Fiennes playing the distinguished and multi-faceted Gustav, Jeff Goldblum playing an honest, very articulate lawyer, and Wilhem Dafoe as a criminal goon, but your favorites might vary. For me, the newcomer playing the lobby boy seemed a bit out of his depth acting-wise, but he was not too distracting and even good sometimes.The movie has a nostalgic feel to it and was quite funny despite being bittersweet. It has a strong energy and was never boring despite lots of mostly talking scenes. I found it particularly amusing whenever Gustave lost control of his distinguished manners and language. Most of the humor came from the clever writing, a few visual gags, and some ridiculous situations. Some might be put off by the obviously fake nature of certain decors and things (scale models), but I think it's probably a trademark of the director and I found those charming. Grand Budapest Hotel was a delight to experience and I would definitely visit it again.Rating: 8.5 out of 10 (remarquable)",9,6,13,22 April 2014
Revolutionary Road," Intense yet subtle suburban drama with amazing acting
","Revolutionary Road is an oddly appropriate and ironic title since it involves 2 smart unconventional young American people in the fifties who want to make their own personal 'revolution' by changing their life. They never felt as if they fit in and it's also why they were partly attracted to each other in the first place. This films marks also the reunion between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, their first since Titanic. Those two turned out to be a few of the greatest actors of their generation and not only are they fully in control of their amazing acting gifts, their chemistry is undeniable. The rest of the cast is completed by fine actors especially the disturbed former engineer. I compare to Titanic but it's more intimate than epic, more suburban drama than romance although there's a fair bit of it that encounters the pitfalls of convention, hypocrisy and fear of change. Revolutionary Road is much closer in spirit to American Beauty by the same director. It's based on an 1961 novel but I found that most of the issues explored are still valid today. Perhaps not how Kate Winslet's character would act in the second half (although it's understandable for the period) but more how certain values and peer pressure can create obstacles preventing us from reaching true happiness and how people react to it. Actually, beyond the couple's conflict, it's the clash of different values that was fascinating to me. It's very dramatic in parts but also subtle emotionally and psychologically. None of the characters are outright bad, they're just human and flawed. I was engrossed by the story and the characters. If there's a slight weakness, it would be that not enough time was spent on showing exactly how the 2 main characters thought differently than the rest of society. I also see how some viewers might be bored by the limited scope and ticked at some of the personal actions taken. One of my joys was to guess what would happen next at certain pivotal events and trying to guess what was taking place inside the character's heads. The dialogues were great, sounded right and were delivered perfectly. The production design was top-notch and nothing seemed out of place or anachronistic although I'm not a specialist of that era. I think Revolutionary Road was indeed one of the best dramas of 2008 and it deserved all the accolades it got.Rating: 8.5 out of 10",9,1,2,11 November 2009
28 Days Later...," Redefined the 'zombie' genre even though it's not zombies
","This one was quite influential in the 'zombie' horror movie\game genre. Not zombies per say but so close to it, the 'infected' were actually fast and agile instead of slow and lumbering. It makes a world of difference in how menacing and scary they are. 28 days later sports a very good suspenseful story that makes you want to see what's next. It has some quite intense moments and some brilliant memorable shots: the deserted streets of London in particular. The acting was quite good from a cast of relative unknowns (at the time). Special mentions must go to the evocative music and how the rain was filmed. It looked amazing and contributed strongly to the atmosphere. Overall, it's one of the best serious horror movies of the start of the 21st century. The only arguable weakness would be the original ending.",9,2,3,23 May 2009
City of God," An ironic title for an artistic movie about crime
","City of God refers to a crime-ridden slum suburb in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This movie follows the lives of several children and teenagers living there from the end of the sixties to the start of the eighties. I found this crime drama more shocking and disturbing than many traditional horror movies. Why? Because most of the characters in there are totally amoral and compassion-less, even enjoying their foul deeds. Worst, some of the offenders are children. There's not much gore but it's very violent and feels very realistic.Most of the actors are unknown and their acting is not noticeable as acting, feels very natural. It's like you're a voyeur of something you wouldn't want to be stuck in. All the characters except perhaps a couple are not likable at all yet they're fascinating to watch. The story based on a book based on true events is gripping and really well told with separated titled chapters (such as the Story of Knockout Ned). The directing is top-notch with some dynamic camera work and sharp editing (already visible in the chicken chase introduction). If you're interested in organized crime movies a la Goodfellas mixed in with some Tarantino style (not the dialog though) in a poor Brazilian hood, this powerful movie is for you. I always find it ironic how gangsters are so religious yet commit atrocities. It's even more ironic in this seemingly god-forsaken ill-named city of god.

Mr. Nobody," Awesome but not for everyone
","How to review this film without giving too much away? Throughout the film, I was constantly surprised and amazed. I think my mouth was hanging slightly open a few times from the brilliance on display. I was totally captivated from start to finish. Taken simply, it's a philosophical sci-fi film, but it's so much more than that. It's about choices, destinies, astrophysics, dreams and memories, just to name a few themes. Taken at its simplest, it's the jumbled recollections of the last mortal man, 118 years old, on Earth in 2092. The problem is that his memories are in total disorder and contradictory. In practice, it means that this is a very non-linear experience in terms of time and space, real and imaginary, showing you results of important choices either way. It doesn't focus on just 2 alternate lives either, things constantly branch out. You would think the film would be a mess, but it's surprisingly cohesive, gripping and even quite touching. I'm sure some will find it confusing, but that's part of the point: Mr. Nobody's memories seem confused and appearances might be deceiving. I found it extremely romantic despite the fact there are 3 very different love interests. One might say that sometimes the dialogue in romantic parts was corny, but I think that the most beautiful declarations of love can be the simplest as long as they are sincere. They felt that way here. The acting was top-notch all over the board with no weak performance in sight. Mr. Nobody's makeup and voice as an old man were perhaps a little distracting but nothing major. It's not a special effects extravaganza, but what was seen was quite imaginative and beautiful to behold. I think the contrast with the more mundane stuff going on makes them even more impressive. Visually, it has an incredible number of different angles and viewpoints all extremely well shot. What's amazing is that the (often) brilliant transitions flow so well from one to another without being jarring.There are so many story threads (most fascinating), so many changes of tones (whimsical to tragic) and so much range (from intimate to grandiose). I think people who like to analyze films would have a field day with this one although it's possible they would nitpick on the borrowed elements. There's also lots of food for thought and should provoke very interesting discussions afterwards especially on what might have happened if choices in your life had been different. Contrary to most films where I tend to think of what I will write in my review as the film is going on, it did not really happen here. I was totally absorbed and that's rare. The choice of songs and musics, mostly known, was excellent and added a lot especially in romantic parts. I'm even considering buying the soundtrack. Mr. Nobody is a challenging but very rewarding film to watch . I don't think it's for everyone, mostly because of its non-linear structure, but those who appreciate unconventional films like Brazil, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Vanilla Sky or Big Fish should be quite pleased. I loved Mr. Nobody and it has become one of my new favorite films. To be quite honest, I wish I could see it again right now... Very highly recommended particularly with someone special.

Insidious," Not as insidious and scary as it could have been
","The trailer is very good and makes you want to watch the movie, although it spoils a few things, so better to avoid if you can. The first half (in the first house) is superbly done: building up suspense, making you unsure what to expect and basically making you focus on the corners of the screens (away from the characters) to anticipate what might appear. This 'where's Waldo game' starts in the credits where some of pictures have something that shouldn't be there or moving. Scares relied on creepy sounds, shadows, inanimate objects moving and quick glimpses of human shapes and faces where they shouldn't be. So, traditional stuff, but it was creepy, and I was buying it. Then not long after the start of the second half, something weird happened as the more things got supernatural, the less I was involved, the less I was unnerved to the point of being quite calm near the end. That big problem, especially for a horror film supposed to be climaxing, might have been caused by 3 possible things: the introduction of comic relief nerd exorcists, the shift from haunted house story to possession story and showing too much of the 'entities' (as in lingering too long).Speaking of which, some of the most memorable parts involved a red-faced 'demon' appearing quickly where it shouldn't be and as a shadow later on. Near the end, the more you saw of him, the less disturbing he became, showing the limitations of his design. So we have a two-headed beast film here: the first half of the movie, scarier, more subtle, insidious even, would be a 8 for remarkable; the second half, flashier, less scary yet still entertaining, would be a 4 for slightly below average. The acting from the family was decent. The acting from the paranormal investigators, especially the old woman, sometimes veered close to caricature. Jump scares weren't cheap, false alert ones and some clichés were intentionally avoided (as heard in the extras). There was some blood but not anything gory or physically disgusting. The Blu-Ray extras, all put together, are a paltry 20 minutes long. If you like that kind of film, you could be doing worse than renting this one, but I wouldn't buy it sight unseen.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)",6,2,3,1 July 2012
Stardust," Worthy unconventional fairy tale that should have been closer to the book
","Let's start by saying I loved the book by Neil Gaiman and recommended it often. Stardust was a very good fantasy movie in the vein of the Princess Bride with its whimsical tone and romantic aspects. Deniro was great fun in his pirate role that wasn't even in the book! As a matter of fact, all the actors were excellent. I wish that they had more fantastical creatures (like the book) and especially that they had not changed the ending of the book, it would have made it much more memorable. A few tweaks here and there, closer adherence to the original source material and it would have been a great classic for the ages. Tim Burton would have been perfect to direct this as I'm sure the original book would have appealed very much to his sensibilities. However, it was a worthy effort nevertheless. It's definitely worth a rental and a purchase if you like fantasy movies with romantic overtones.Rating: 7 out of 10",7,9,13,24 May 2009
School of Rock," Fairly enjoyable amusing fare
",School of Rock is enjoyable to watch and mostly works for adults (especially those who've loved rock music at some point) although I think kids might like it more. Jack Black's playing is a bit forced by moments but overall he's very likable. The kids themselves were a varied bunch that did their job competently although they didn't always feel natural. I liked the message portrayed by the movie although we've seen a similar theme in countless movies before (unconventional teacher trying to inspire students). I didn't find School of Rock extremely funny but it was amusing. The most important thing I suppose is to be entertaining and it did succeed in that regard. It's more a rental than a purchase unless you're an unconditional Jack Black fan. Rating: 7 out of 10,7,4,6,25 May 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Great story based on such a simple concept
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button boasts a very good storyline taking place over near a century with a simple but interesting concept: a man growing younger instead of older. It did not seem long although it lasts almost 3 hours. It did make me think of Forrest Gump, specifically how you see the characters in the historical context although Benjamin doesn't really meet famous people. Cate Blanchett in simply sublime in every possible way as the female lead. So beautiful, gracious and soulful. Brad Pitt in the title role is adequate but sometimes lacks enough emotion to truly relate to the audience.The directing is sober but very strong with several beautiful cinematographic moments (it did win the academy award for best cinematography and also for visual effects). I would have liked in general if the film had been more melodramatic because it sins by excess of moderation. I would have liked to be moved to the point of tears. The potential was there. It is possible the director David Fincher simply respected the spirit and story of the original novel but I somehow doubt the movie is that faithful. In finishing, was I the only one who was a bit disturbed by the somewhat artificial appearance of Benjamin when he was young (when he resembled an old man)? It's just my opinion and the film did win the academy award for best makeup which is deserved considering how well the aging or de-aging of the characters were done. It's worth buying unless you're allergic to Brad Pitt. Rating: 8 out of 10",7,1,3,14 June 2009
Clash of the Titans," The problem with Clash of the Titans
","I finally saw it in glorious 2d on my high-definition TV set. The ingredients could have been there for a wonderful heroic movie but it was a miss for me. The special effects were certainly professional, especially the creatures, but I felt disconnected and even bored more than once. The heroics you would expect were not exciting or elating like they should have been (see '300' or 'Lord of the Rings' for that). The deaths were practically all lame and anticlimactic. In fiction, I expect deaths to shock, amaze and/or move me. None of that here. Worst of all, sometimes I didn't even know if a named character had just just died! Not for suspense reasons but because it was badly filmed. In an epic fantasy movie, I expect to feel some awe and wonder. Those feelings were not really there for me. The flight on a winged steed didn't thrill me at all as it did in 'Avatar' or 'How to Train your Dragon'.The characters were mostly cardboard, uninteresting and didn't have much presence except for Io, the only female companion, who had an otherwordly yet classical beauty quality to her, and Hades the God of the Underworld. The little seen Greek Gods were underwhelming and the more present Zeus (Liam Neeson)'s armor was not only too shiny (perhaps to hide the low-quality craftmanship) but his beard was ugly and distracting. It bugged me that Perseus the hero became a master swordfighter in one battle (heredity can only explain so much) and that no one bothered to close their eyes or cover them while fighting the Medusa. To people who say there's no story, I would say instead that there's a simple one. The problem is that it's not that engrossing or memorable. You can easily be distracted by the successions of fights especially when the few character moments (supposed to build up sympathy for the characters) are lacking.The story also relies too often on surprise allies or cheap gimmicks to get the heroes out of trouble. For the last adversary who should be near impossible to defeat, it felt as if the director just badly needed to wrap things up quickly. It doesn't excuse how short, illogical and disappointing that 'battle' was. Oh and lest we forget, there is no clash between 'Titans' per say. It's more clashes between humans and mythological creatures. This remake is certainly watchable, would make an acceptable rental for fantasy fans, but it lacks in heart and talent what it certainly does not lack in budget.Rating : 4 out of 10 (Poor)",4,4,5,13 September 2010
Paranormal Activity," Paradoxical paranormal chiller
","Paranormal Activity (PA) is a rare anomaly, the extremely small budget indie flick (15,000$, the price of a car) filmed in one week with one hand-held camera and unknown actors that ends up being very popular. Many will compare it to the 1999's Blair Witch Project, which is not a bad comparison but it's different in the fact it takes place in one location (a suburban home) and that I found it much better and especially scarier. I've seen lots of horror movies and I've grown rather blasé and hard to please. PA actually gave me chills and I don't think it was because of the air conditioning. It slowly instilled dread and shocked me a few times. The story alternates between daytime sequences in the house and nighttime sequences with one night-vision equipped camera stuck in the corner of the bedroom. I quite suspect many people will find the day sections boring and banal but without them the night sections wouldn't be so suspenseful. It's the art of creating tension, releasing it and recreating it again. If you have constant tension, then people get used to it and it's not as effective.So although it starts rather tame with nothing or little happening, I was soon dreading the nights and hoping for them to end quickly. The day-night routine cycle is one of the secrets why PA is so effective as well as the unnerving low-frequency bass noise used sparingly instead of a standard soundtrack. This is not special-effects oriented nor does it have professional cinematography. It looks amateurish and intentionally so. It relies on the Hitchcock philosophy that it's scarier to hear, glimpse and imagine than to see everything. I think it also works because most of the eerie stuff could easily happen in our homes. It's those strengths that will appear as weaknesses to jaded audiences. We can also expect the usual backlash seen with highly hyped surprise hits. You go in expecting one of the scariest movies of all time and you prepare yourself unconsciously for this so in the end you can brag that it wasn't that scary.Fright is subjective. For what it's worth, I'm not easily scared but I have no choice but to admit I became emotionally involved. If you're interested in seeing PA, then try to go in open-minded and preferably with someone else in a crowded theater. You run the high risk of having to deal with noisy undisciplined groups of teens (as I did) but hopefully the rest of the public will eventually placate them or the scariness eventually will. Rarely have I seen a movie-going public being so scared and tense, and not because of gore (none here). Seeing this in a crowd is a great experience if you're lucky enough but on the other hand, I can see PA being quite effective late at night at home with a significant other with the added benefit of not having the first part of the movie ruined by hecklers. Actually, although I rate this movie highly, I'm not sure I should recommend it because it's insidious. It does tend to get under your skin, linger in your thoughts afterwards, particularly before you sleep perhaps provoking insomnia and nightmares and it could make certain normal house occurrences much creepier. Avoid this film if you live alone and in a creaky/drafty home.Rating: 9 out of 10P.S.: I quite suspect this would be a great date movie. It would favor closeness during the show and your date (or yourself) might not want to sleep alone afterwards. ;-)",9,3,6,28 October 2009
Avatar," Once in a blue moon comes something like this
","Why write another review of this film that will get lost amongst the hundreds of other reviews out there ? ... Why not ;-) I'll skip the usual movie recap which you've no doubt already read to focus more on the impressions and emotions I felt during the screening. It's amazing how the graphics in Avatar look so state-of-the-art despite the film being in production for so very long and all the incredible advances made during the past decade. I saw it in Imax 3d which is the best way to go for experiencing it as it was intended to be. Avatar was a grand spectacle that made me smile throughout not because it was funny but because of how wondrous it was. Yes, I felt a sense of awe and wonder which is something I rarely experience anymore. That Pandora planet, its fauna and flora, was breathtaking in its splendor and variety. Certainly, you could associate most of the alien creatures with an earthly equivalent but they still looked great and original anyway.The main indigenous species, the giant blue humanoid Na'vi, could have been the deal breaker. From previews, it was said they looked and moved too much like video game characters. I understand yet disagree with that criticism but I admit I had to get used to them myself. However, they are indeed fascinating to watch and they do emote very well. They are believable and a technical marvel. An unforeseen bonus is that they're quite good-looking in their tall graceful cat-like ways and that the females are mostly topless although the nipples are almost always artfully blurred or concealed. There are scenes and cinematic angles in Avatar that could not have been done in the past without that level of computer graphics. They are seamless in execution, blending the real and the virtual. It's not enough to be able to do them, you have to do them well and Cameron excels. His camera work is bold and exciting. I particularly appreciated the sequences that made you feel as if you were really part of the environment or a character in the scene. This brings me to the 3d effects. I think they intentionally tried to avoid cheap tricks such as having spears poke at you or creatures trying to bite your head off, breaking the fourth wall so to speak. They can be surprising but those usually take you out of the picture. The 3d effects here are mostly used to give depth to the environments, again trying to make you feel part of the scene. I think they worked amazingly well and it's probably the best use of 3d effects in a motion feature I've seen yet. The colors didn't feel faded or washed-out as in previous 3d efforts. Quite the contrary in fact, the colors were bright and luxuriant although I cannot compare with the 2d version.I found the action scenes quite exciting, even exhilarating especially the flying scenes. The battles were tense, easily followable with none of the usual closed-in shaky camera crap. I sometimes feared for the fate of certain characters as they were put in danger or were about to do something particularly foolhardy and/or heroic. However, I had difficulty caring for them as well. I don't know if it's because the secondary characters were not developed enough, because of computer graphics or something else. The movie is long but the storyline, with its strong ecological overtones and white people vs native people metaphors, kept my interest. The above average acting did not distract from the proceedings and I particularly enjoyed Sigourney Weaver and the security chief. Some criticized the dialogue but I must say that despite its seeming lack of originality, it does the job and I for one liked the similarities to stuff we've heard from certain authorities to justify their controversial actions. The music was pretty awesome and fit the scenes rather well but none of the themes struck me as being memorable (a la John Williams). No cheesy songs until the ending generic at least. I would not have minded spending even more time immersed in this alien world. Avatar isn't just about being spectacular, it does try to be about something and that makes it more special, no matter how unsubtle the message might be. With luck, it will indeed be a great success and will influence in a positive way the kids watching it. Will Avatar become a cult phenomenon like Star Wars in its time? I find it unlikely but it's too soon to tell. One thing for certain though, love it or hate it, Avatar is a benchmark and many future sci-fi films will be compared to it. I would like to watch it again in the theatres but I do wonder how it will hold up on a smaller screen down the line. As it is, I suggest seeing it in the best theatre you can find while you still can. Try not to get your expectations too high (it's not the second coming) and try not to focus too much on finding shortcomings with the Na'vi like I did (they're pretty great) Rating: 8.5 out of 10",9,2,7,21 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Seriously fun horror-comedy or comedy of horrors?
","This is a rare hybrid that manages to be both scary and/or funny depending on the moment. At first I thought it might be a standard scare fest as it starts that way, with perhaps a few comedic moments thrown in throughout to release the tension, but as it went on the madcap antics and gross-out humor took over. It's not a bad thing in itself but viewers should be warned. It felt like a b-movie with a-movie production quality in a big budget 'Evil Dead' vein. It's not at all in the ridiculous 'Scary movie' category of horror comedy. The script is too smart for that and the actors play it mostly seriously. The director Sam Raimi basically toys with your emotions making you laugh or jump, sometimes one right after the other. Raimi is very good at exploiting shadows, camera work and sound effects to create frights. He manages to scare you with seemingly inoffensive objects. He makes funny things that shouldn't be funny. Those are not easy things to do and I applaud the clever ways he does so.There's a lot of fun to be had watching 'Drag me to hell' and it contains its share of joyous moments provided you have a somewhat dark twisted sense of humor. There are some gory or disgusting moments but nothing particularly extreme. I wish the balance between horror and comedy had stayed more even until the end but a fine line was walked nevertheless. My enjoyment was somewhat diminished by a neighboring girl in the theater spoiling a big twist long beforehand by shouting it to her friend but I shouldn't blame her too much since she seemed so enthusiastic. However, it means I don't really know if that twist is predictable or not but honestly I would think it is. Rating: 7.5 out of 10",8,1,4,4 June 2009
Super 8," Future modern classic for nostalgic Spielberg fans and newer viewers alike
","It's not for nothing I use apparently contradictory terms in the title. Super 8 is a throwback to those old Steven Spielberg's movies from the 70s/80s made with modern technology. It's not made by Spielberg (only produced) but it could have been made by him. The movie doesn't look old although it takes place in 1979. There's a palpable sense of nostalgia going on and we follow the tribulations of a group of film-making boys (and girl) as a spectacular and peculiar train crash changes their lives. It would be easy to reveal too much but I'll refrain myself. I hope myself that you know as little as possible before watching this.I'll just say that there are fantastical elements including the main one that is rather scary but ambiguous. In fact, I loved how Super 8 harked back to the old school of thought that showing less is more. This could be frustrating, but it wasn't for me because the movie was directed so expertly. In fact, I think that style of directing built up the suspense. You often see the effects but not the cause. The sound effects (especially during the train crash) were amazing and would deserve some kind of award. The special effects were seamless and my disbelief was never suspended because they looked fake or computer-generated. The boys acted quite naturally but the blonde girl was a definite stand-out. In one of the best moments, she play-acts an awkwardly written scene for the boy's amateur film and she's so good, she not only moves the boys but the viewers. The adult actors are mostly stoic but they do their job.The father-son relationship could have been a bit better as it didn't grab me very much. I loved how the story was told without sacrificing characterization. You're never lost and it just flows well. Kudos to the director J.J. Abrahms for doing such a stupendous job at recapturing the magic of the early Spielberg films. It does make us nostalgic in more ways than one, not only for that time period but for that kind of great film. I do also think that younger viewers will enjoy it, but it is rather scary in parts so it would be best for kids 10 and older. Lest I forget, besides the suspenseful moments, there's quite a bit of humour that makes us care about the characters or gives us a little breather. That Super 8 movie at the end is hilarious.Rating: 8 out 10 (Very good)",8,2,3,24 July 2011
Up," Delightful, sweet and charming : another Pixar classic
","Pixar does it again. I've watched almost every Pixar movie and it seems that despite the potentially least interesting, least commercial subject (an old guy flying away in his balloon-covered house), they just can't go wrong. It's another great film, exquisitely animated and downright beautiful to behold. What makes Pixar films, and 'Up' in particular, so special? My theory is that beyond the amazing 3d computer graphics, it boils down to likable characterizations and heartwarming humanistic moralistic stories that don't consider their audiences stupid with a dash of good humor and a pinch of wonder added for good measure. Basically, Pixar films like 'Up' usually have 'heart' without feeling forced or fake. The life story of the old guy presented at the start was a wondrous touching piece of work accompanied only by beautiful evocative music. Actually the music in 'Up' is noteworthy for its emotional effectiveness throughout. The story might appear a bit simple in hindsight but it works beautifully and touches on several universal themes and values such as grief, friendship and acceptance. It has its sad dramatic moments but overall it's quite fun, funny and dare I say uplifting. This coming from a guy who's usually allergic to 'feel good' movies. It even has an underlying romantic background that makes everything more special.Why is it that Pixar movies, 'Up' being the latest case, often have better acting than most live-action films? Is it because of slightly-exaggerated animated emotions, the top-notch voice-acting or the incredible facial expressions and body language? I do wonder how 'Up' would keep the interest for younger children. The pace is sometimes intentionally slow (old guy being a bit slower) and it does have quieter introspective moments. Some places might be up over their head but I think the lovable enthusiastic bumbling boy scout and dog would certainly help keep their interest and it's likely they will be fascinated by the graphics and grumpy old guy. I think 'Up' can appeal equally to adults and children alike and if the high praise from every corner hasn't convinced you yet, it's definitely worth watching and owning eventually. I certainly want to see it again. Grandparents in particular should see this with their grand kids, or even alone if they don't have any, as they might find it inspiring. My only exception to my high recommendation would be for those few who have disliked Pixar movies in the past. 'Up' probably won't change their mind but then again why not give it a try anyway?

How to Train Your Dragon," Dazzling dragon delight
","'How to train your dragon' is based on a humorous fantasy novel of the same name. I cannot compare the stories of the two but where the book has rather ugly pictures, the movie dazzles with amazing visuals. I think they would be great looking even if you didn't see the movie in 3d. It's not only the quality of the renders, it's the quality of the animation. I think it works best when the young viking Hiccup starts to interact with the fallen dragon. They are very lifelike and expressive even though the dragon does not talk. Later on, the flying sequences are not only spectacular but exhilarating. I had my doubts about the look of the main dragon (the one on the posters) but it managed to win my approval in both looks (a bit small though) but mostly personality wise. There's lots of very dynamic exciting action in this movie and it's mostly done with a cheerful fun tone most of the time even though there's still danger. As I recall, there's no visible gore, dismemberments or even blood, making it very family friendly. However, despite that lack of 'realism', I do think that adults will enjoy it a lot too. The story is not the most original (except for the original premise) but it's very well told, with good character development and has a fairly good morale for those into that. I think Gerard Butler voicing the viking chief is a natural for that kind of stoic warrior role. However, I would have preferred another voice for the teen hero as I found it sounding too old (the actor is in his late twenties). The rest of the voice cast is fine. My only other criticism is that there's a part of the ending that we've seen a hundred times before especially in kids movies and I would have preferred a little more originality there or at least see it better done because I didn't really buy into it. So, all in all, provided you still have a little bit of a kid's heart in you and are not allergic to dragons, it's likely you will have a great time watching this very entertaining movie.Rating : 8 out of 10",8,2,3,2 May 2010
The Descent," Nightmarish spelunking
","It was rather good with a few decent jumps (read: surprises that make you jump) and creepy moments. I wasn't overly scared but then it takes a lot to achieve that with me. The plot is pretty simple but sometimes simple is best. I think the production design for the cave network setting was well done and suitably claustrophobic. I liked how the whole thing was lighted, in a place with no external light sources. It was played seriously and for me the actresses were quite convincing with a stand-out performance by the lead. However sometimes it was tough to distinguish the actresses but I did like the ambiguity of certain characters who don't always act heroically although they're basically good people. It's worth a rental but perhaps not a purchase at full price unless you're a big survival horror fanRating: 7 out of 10",7,1,3,24 May 2009
In Time," Mind clocking out early yet movie overstaying its welcome
","It's an interesting concept that deserved a much better story, better actors and several other things. I clocked out rather rapidly when things that didn't make sense started happening. Combine that with stupid behaviour from the protagonists, and my suspension of disbelief just got waylaid. I kept thinking to myself how and why? Just a few examples. How does he have that amount of time left (more than once)? How is it so easy to steal from a loaning bank? Why is there no security? Why does the fugitive stay at his own address when he knows the police knows his identity? I could go on.I found the acting rather poor especially from Amanda Seyfried (the ravishing redhead daughter), with a couple of exceptions (the 'older' guys being two). The suspense was rather pitiful and the few action scenes were unexciting. That forearm 'wrestling' with the time codes was just ridiculous. As for special effects, besides the glowing green digital clocks under people's forearms and a few cheap-looking modified vehicles, there wasn't much else. The thinly-veiled social commentary on the woes of capitalism was badly done and I'm one who usually enjoys such criticism. Emotional moments fell flat and artificial. The dialogue too often seemed awkward or cliché even when not delivered poorly. This movie was weak on all fronts (except lighting because I'm nice). It's a badly implemented sci-fi concept, lame thriller and boring action movie that felt longer than its actual running time.Rating: 3 out of 10 (Poor)",3,11,20,26 May 2012
Zombieland," Fun but overrated
","The trailer makes the film seem better than it is, ruining some of the best gags, but the film is entertaining and fun nevertheless. Zombieland has a very good start from the point of view of a young survivor who has created a bunch of rules for survival in this zombie-infested land. Those give us some of the best early moments as his no-nonsense sensible approach contrasts with the usual macho heroics or clueless stupidity of typical horror movie characters. Then he meets the proverbial reckless macho redneck zombie-killing machine, Woody Harelson in a very enjoyable and enthusiastic performance, and thus odd couple hijinks ensue. It seemed to me that the energy level and inspiration dipped down, with occasional upwards bumps, but never down to the ground of mediocrity, as time passed. A bit like a roller-coaster ride after the big first drop. That 'drop' seems to happen a little after the meeting with the girls, roughly a third of the way through when zombies get scarcer.The infamous cameo (hope nobody ruined it for you) is fun but not as great as some people might leave you to believe. However, it's eventually responsible for one of the biggest laughs so what do I know. I liked the characters, found them likeably imperfect and flawed sometimes even sweet, but I did find little Miss Sunshine (Abigail Breslin) shooting guns somewhat disturbing ;-) This film having zombies, you can expect some gore, mostly of the open mouth spewing blood variety, but the most extreme scenes are more farcical than horrific. As an horror comedy, Zombieland is quite good and should preferably be seen in a crowded theater or with a bunch of expressive friends. It's not as inspired, original or consistently funny as the recent Shaun of the Dead, Drag me to Hell or the more obscure Dance of the Dead but it's a worthy entry in this sub-genre of comedy. I've seen all of those in crowded theaters and there was more crowd reaction for these than for Zombieland who at the moment (at #147 of all-time best films on IMDb) is overrated.Rating: 7 out of 10",7,2,4,14 October 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," More than meets the eye: less than meets the brain
","To make an awkward analogy, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is like a stupid and superficial party-crazy super-model on drugs with a car/military fetish. This is a tough movie to review. It's bound to make a ton of money even though the professional critics pretty much hated it. Who's wrong? the public who pays to see it and liked it or the critics? If I don't like it, am I being snobbish and expecting too much of a summer popcorn blockbuster? I liked the first movie way more than I expected, it was fun, spectacular, exciting and the robots were cool. The second movie left me numb and perplexed. It starts well enough with a thrilling action sequence (where you do have trouble identifying who are the good and bad guys, a recurring problem) followed by a relaxed scene showing the funny returning parents (love the mother) and the upcoming trip to college by Sam (played by Shia Labeouf who does a very good job as usual). At that point, the movie still felt right.I'm not sure how a rather simple plot became confusing. I also had trouble caring about the fate of the characters. Since I'm not particularly dumb and tend to enjoy more complex films, I'll attribute this to bad storytelling. There's even a big deus ex machina for good measure, sign of the lazy writer. The film is also blatantly commercial and excels into making American military look heroic so if those things bug you, steer clear. On one hand, the visual effects are awesome, on the other hand the writing sucks and the dialog is trite. The actions scenes are spectacular but very busy and too often you have trouble identifying the fighting robots. The robots have virtually no characterization and often go unnamed. The exceptions would be Bumblebee but only at the start, the little twin cars who are not only annoying but hard to understand, an older bearded robot seen later on and a tiny hyperactive radio-controlled monster truck. There's a huge variety of Transformers, they look amazing and their transformations are even better than the first film but how I wish they had at least some of the minimal characterizations of the TV shows. Is that too much to ask? The music is appropriately bombastic or heroic. The sound effects are loud and powerful. Yet the sound mix is sometimes bad, drowning out the voices. The director Michael Bay is quite good at making visually impressive set pieces and money shots (he loves his slow-motion) yet he falters in other ways. The movie logs in at around 2 hours and a half. It started feeling long mid-way through. The old returning characters are still the best, the new ones, either human or robotic, are lackluster. It's certainly not as good as the first film, which to be fair, had the novelty factor going for it. The human parts are not as clever or engaging. There's more robots but keeping track is confusing and it's almost too much of a good thing. The sequel has more of everything except storyline, human touch and charm. If you liked the first, you'll likely be curious to see the sequel, if you haven't done already, but I wouldn't pay full price for it. If you're a male who loves hot babes, hot rods/robots, cool action and lots of explosions, you're going to love this. I was disappointed but not as much as the critics said I should be.Rating: 5.5 out of 10",6,2,7,1 July 2009
The Reader," It's all in the eyes
","A very good somewhat subtle movie where almost everything is in the unsaid, the subtext and the eyes of the characters. The always sublime Kate Winslet did not get an academy award nomination for nothing. She's bold enough to act without makeup, naked and at different ages. The other actors were fine also (including Ralph Fiennes, excuse the bad pun ;-). I wish it had been more touching for me but it's already great that the character played by Kate Winslet was multidimensional and not unlikeable despite her sins. Lest I forget, besides the 'love' story element, there is a strong reflexion about morality, guilt and doing what's right. As a former and hopefully future bookseller/librarian, the reading parts of the story were some of the scenes I preferred. It's definitely worth a rental but probably not a purchase as watching it once is probably enough.Rating: 7 out of 10",7,1,1,24 May 2009
The Wrestler," Compelling character study in the world of wrestling
","The Wrestler is a fascinating foray into what happens to those muscle bound pugilistic 'actors' when they get older and their glory days are behind them. We view this by following the steps of Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a pro wrestling champion back in the eighties who has fallen on hard times and still wrestles part time. Beyond seeing the tricks of the trade and the camaraderie between wrestlers (interesting in themselves), this movie is a human drama tackling themes such as loneliness, poverty, growing old and finding purpose in life.It brought back Rourke to public consciousness and frankly he deserves all the praise he got. He inhabits the character both physically (he has the physique and the scars) and emotionally. His portrayal makes you care even if you find wrestling ridiculous. Marisa Tomei as his stripper friend is good and surprising because she dares to be topless more than once even though she's not so young anymore. There's an interesting parallel between the upcoming end of her career and the Ram who has trouble letting go of his own. Some of the most emotional compelling moments also come from the interactions between the Ram and his estranged daughter.I also quite enjoyed when we see the Ram working at a normal day job. It's amusing but not in an over-the-top way (I since learned that some of it was improvised with real customers). The directing is sober, often following Rourke a few steps behind his back, perhaps to contrast with the flashiness of the wrestling shows. The fake wrestling, which is fake by nature yet dangerous nevertheless, looked authentic and realistic. I had issues with the open ending that's defensible dramatically but leaves you disappointed. Overall, it's a very good film, slightly overrated, on a subject rarely tackled seriously in fiction. It's well worth renting unless you're totally allergic to wrestling and even then. It should be requisite watching for wrestling fans but then it might lower their enjoyment of the 'sport' afterwards.Rating: 7.5 out of 10",8,1,2,23 August 2009
Inception," Very good but over-rated
","I'm the type of guy who usually loves this type of sci-fi movie with far-out concepts, especially if it involves dreams. After finally being able to watch Inception, I must admit I fall somewhere 'in-between' in my appreciation of this film. In-between best movie ever and horrible illogical mess but strongly leaning towards the positive side. The trailer, for once, doesn't tell you much but certainly wets your appetite. Avoiding spoilers, 'Inception' refers to the concept of planting an idea deep into the subconscious of a person through dreams. A team of specialists usually extract secret informations from minds but doing an 'inception' is much riskier because apparently people always know where they get their ideas from (really ?!). While the 'architect' of the team builds a believable landscape (so the dreamer doesn't notice he's dreaming), the others infiltrate and try to influence the dreamer for their own purposes. You would expect flights of fancy and crazy visuals from dreams but it's fairly restrained here (except for the training of a new architect and one of the ending dream layers with crumbling buildings). It is explained by the fact that the dream must remain realistic to the target otherwise projections of his subconscious will attack the intruders and/or he will realize he is dreaming.So despite the fact I would have enjoyed more imagination in the dreamscapes (as hinted at in the wondrous architect's training), I understand why they were fairly normal. I could not help but feel a bit disappointed by that though. The action scenes were frenetic and exciting with particular praise going to the anti-gravity fight scene in the hotel. This is a great anthology moment if I ever saw one. Cinematographically, this is great with director Nolan going from spectacular bird's eye city views to closed-in face shots to show the emotions with a whole variety of angles between the extremes. The shooting is masterful. We're never really lost in the action except perhaps when the characters look too much alike in the snowy dream layer. Speaking of which, this part felt very much like a James Bond movie and I kept thinking the 'hero' was too good to be true. Then again, we're in a dream and who knows how much training the operatives have... I was also bugged by the fact that rules were explained for the dream layers and yet some seemed to have been ignored. I know it's 'dream logic' but if you intentionally explain them, mostly stick to them so we can continue suspending disbelief. An example of this is how the guy in the hotel is supposed to have 2 minutes left until something has to happen, yet if you combine his sequences (because it alternates between 3 different stories/dream layers at that point), it's way more than the time alloted. For more, see the list of goofs on the main IMDb page (after watching the movie).Inception is praised as being complex and smart. Compared to the majority of other summer blockbusters, it certainly is. In the absolute though, I don't think it's the most brilliant or completely logically coherent movie out there. The base concept is better than the actual execution, which to be fair is pretty good. The interesting plot is certainly understandable for the majority of normal people so perhaps it makes them feel smart (therefore good about themselves). People who don't like it as much as they do, or point out logical flaws, are therefore not as 'smart' as they are or simply 'don't get it'. It sometimes feels to me as if there was a mass 'inception' (from peer pressure, the director's reputation or marketing?), planting the idea that this movie is amazing before even watching it and that if you're not totally enthusiastic about it, there's something wrong with you. I think people should be allowed to fall somewhere in-between. Enjoying it very much, recognizing its many qualities, but not seeing it as one of the best movies ever done (top 5 currently on IMDb is ridiculous). Why ? Because if you really think about it, I'm sure you've seen many movies that had a much more powerful emotional impact on you.Rating : 7 out of 10 (very good)",7,4,7,19 August 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The brave, the bold and the brilliant
","I'm a fan of movies in general, super-hero films in particular as well as live theatre, and I loved Birdman. Birdman is not a super-hero film. It's a very intimate and talkative dramedy taking mostly place in a New York Broadway theatre where a formerly famous actor who played Bat-- Birdman many years ago is trying to revive his career by adapting, directing and starring in a serious play. Let's start by perhaps the most amazing thing about this film: an extremely long sequence-shot, without seemingly any cuts, lasting for around 100 minutes! The way it's filmed, it feels as if you're an invisible stalker or ghost. It also sometimes feels as if you're in there with the actors. There's one camera, the same camera, always following a character without breaks. It's not always the same character, and it's not always in the same location. In fact, it feels as if you're exploring the private underbelly of a theatre on the verge of a new production. It might sound boring and limited but it felt very dynamic to me. In fact, the lively characters (popping in and out) and the excellent cinematography made the experience fascinating. I sometimes wondered how they managed that exploit although I have ideas of where cuts were hidden (doors or dark places). Be warned though that some of us with shorter attention spans, now used to fast cuts in TV and film, could find this constant lingering tiring sometimes. Some, like me, might find the effort rewarding. I should mention that despite the very long take (without apparent cuts), that it takes place over a few days, not over a few hours.I particularly liked how the Michael Keaton's character sometimes heard the critical, cynical voice of what we assume is his Birdman 'persona'. Well, it sounded like Bat-- Birman. Also very interesting to me was how snippets of super powers were shown as if there was more to him than meets the eye. They were not overdone, and they culminated in satisfying, yet short, outdoor sequences. This is not an action film though, very far from it. Don't go watching this expecting superhero shenanigans because you'll be sorely disappointed. This is about relationships and psychology. It's about a formerly popular movie star's desperate quest for respect and admiration, as well as about his theatre entourage. I admit that the parallels of Riggan, the main character, to Michael Keaton's life and how he might be adds a lot of interest that wouldn't be there if the role was played by anybody else.The characters were played by great actors at the top of their form. Michael Keaton in the lead played the most complex and perhaps broken of them all, in a bold performance going through a wide range of emotions. He has my vote for best lead actor at the Oscars this year. Edward Norton as an eccentric method actor was a hoot. The women were dead-on and just sounded true. Was the movie funny? Sometimes, when it involved unexpected humiliations, interactions with Norton, or clever lines. It was also fairly dramatic sometimes, but it didn't come close to making me cry. I was constantly emotionally engaged though. Not only by the story, but by the characters and, of course, the technical and artistic wizardry on display. I've never seen a film quite like this and I've seen lots of films.I forgot to mention the very peculiar soundtrack that mostly consists of drum solos, and a little classical music during plays. I'm not sure I liked it but kudos for being different and not totally annoying me. My only other personal criticism would be (to avoid spoilers) the flights of fancy. Sometimes, in amazement, I wondered how they did it without cutting and with people around; sometimes, it looked awkward. Anyway, it's not really important. This is a smart, original and surprising film that impressed me.Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)",9,4,14,15 November 2014
Iron Man," Acting, writing and armour makes Iron Man fly at the top of the genre
","This is the first actual movie made by Marvel comics's own studio instead of having their characters 'leased' to another movie studio. They hit this one out of the park. The script is smart but what made Iron Man such a critical and financial success beyond the special effects is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. I just cannot imagine someone who could be more suave, funny and perfect as a genius playboy millionaire tech geek (yes, he beats whatsisname as Bruce Wayne handily). It's like having an Oscar-calibre actor in a popcorn superhero movie. We actually have three with Gwynneth Paltrow and the underrated Jeff Bridges. Tony Stark seems excited about creating and trying his Iron Man armour and it transmits to the audience. I remember thinking when I first saw Iron Man that despite Stark's genius, he could also be a jerk and irresponsible hothead but it's to Robert Downey's Jr and the writer's credits that you like Stark anyway.There's a genuine sense of fun permeating the whole film yet it's not without its serious dramatic moments. Everything would crumble if the superhero armour wasn't up to snuff but the different versions look amazing and believable, with lots of little incidental animation making it more dynamic. Sometimes you might think it's computer generated (and honestly it probably is most of the time) but it's easy to suspend your disbelief especially with the constant but cool close-up shots of Tony Stark inside the helmet with those constantly updating computer readings. That clever trick permits us to see the emotions that are not outwardly visible from the outside. Iron Man doesn't reinvent the superhero movie genre like Watchmen does but it does everything right while adding a few bits of originality such as the initially egotistical selfish almost villainous protagonist who changes as well as the guy becoming super-powered not through accident or mutation but by designing the coolest armours ever seen on screen. Let's not forget that clever never seen before ending who put a big smile on my face and probably most people who watched it in theatres the first time.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,3,6,14 August 2009
Beowulf," Bloody good Beowulf
","I admit that when I first saw the preview for this years ago I thought it was made with real actors although it seemed not quite right. So I saw it in 3d when it was in theaters and I saw it recently on my TV. The graphics still hold up extremely well today (2009) with some of the most life-like computer characters I've seen not only in terms of likeness but in terms of acting. It should be since advanced motion capture technology was used extensively with the real actors including facial expressions. The process is interesting because it allowed a wonderful character actor (Ray Winstone) to play a buff hero like Beowulf although he's middle-aged, not particularly in shape and basically looking nothing like the hero. It allowed a fine eccentric actor like Crispin Glover to play the very physical role of Grendel, the monster, and actually give it a tormented pitiable yet menacing presence. As for the other more famous actors, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright-Penn and John Malkovitch, they are quite recognizable, almost in an eerie way, yet not quite the same. The highlight for me was Robin Wright-Penn in the role of the queen. Her sad facial expressions shone through despite the virtual avatar.The story is basically the Beowulf legend retold with a few creative liberties taken here and there. It's the foundation for many other stories and the prototypical warrior hero. At first glance, it seems rather simple but it's told really well and it has a mythic otherworldly quality to it. Beowulf as a character has a nice character arc and shows personality although he's not the most likable fellow, more of a macho boastful jerk actually. The action scenes are thrilling and filmed with angles and camera movements that are often surprising and original: sometimes not possible in real life. I especially enjoyed a long sequence where Beowulf fights naked yet his 'member' is artfully hidden throughout. On occasion, certain scenes show that they were trying to impress with the 3d effects and it makes things look artificial on TV (ex: guard poking spear at Beowulf's head). At their best which is most of the time, the computer graphics are almost totally photo-realistic. At their worst, especially for secondary characters, they make us think of the human characters from Shrek. The monster designs and animations are wonderful and impressive with particular credit going for Grendel. So all in all, I think that although Beowulf might not have the most emotionally involving story or the most relatable characters, it's still quite entertaining and exciting today and you should have a very good time watching it. It has lots of dismemberments and bloody killings so people allergic to that should be warned.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,2,3,28 December 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Delightfully fun Mr. Fox
","Fantastic Mr. Fox is an adaptation of a somewhat famous children's book by writer Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was originally written by him). I cannot really say if it's faithful or not (apparently not very much) nor can I say how much it compares to director Wes Anderson's other works (my fan friend says you have lots of his signature touches). However, I can say that it's likely adults will enjoy it more than kids. This is a completely stop-motion picture instead of the more ubiquitous 3d computer graphics showcase. It has a certain retro vibe to it and although it's charming, often funny, you shouldn't expect the animation quality and smoothness of Nightmare Before Christmas or Coraline. The jerkiness is especially noticeable when the animals are dancing. However, the faces and the (constantly moving) fur are especially well done. Actually, I suspect the many close-up shots were used to save on the animation costs of animating the whole puppet. Most importantly, the whole movie using real puppets, props and decors has a solid 'realness' quality to it often absent from 3d graphics. Enough about that. How's the story ? Quite delightful and entertaining with personable characters and bundles of dry and awkward humor that actually works. The running gag of the opossum making swirly eyes when he gets confused never gets old. I also enjoyed variations on the word cuss used profusely instead of the famous f word. The voice acting is top-notch and George Clooney is a perfect fit for the suave and charismatic Mr. Fox. You'll notice his voice but you won't notice most of the other famous voices unless you're a big Wes Anderson fan. The dialogue is very fine and the choice of music is surprising, appropriate and good. Fantastic Mr. Fox is pretty fantastic and because of the way it was made and looks, this might age quite well and become a future classic. Whatever you do, don't let the fact that it's supposed to be a 'kid's movie' deter you from watching it. For interested parents, it's not overtly violent although there's poultry killing (heard, not shown) and beyond the amusing antics, it even has some morale (but doesn't hit you over the head with it).

Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Honest look 20 years later at what was a most excellent movie.
","Two Californian wannabe rock star teens, one played by Keanu Reeves of Matrix fame, are going to flunk their history class. Thankfully, a time traveller from the future, where those 2 same guys are revered as icons, comes back and gives them a time machine in the shape of a phone booth. Our heroes proceed to kidnap famous historical figures for their final expose. This is one of the quintessential 80s movies that was better in my memory than it is now, but still manages to be rather amusing. The main attraction for me this time around was their 'most excellent' way of talking, full of slacker-surf lingo of the 80s. Our heroes seem dumb, but they have their hearts in the right place and are somewhat more clever than initially appears. This shows in the complicated words they sometimes use and in how they use the time machine to their advantage in the final part.The 'kidnapping' sequences of the famous historical figures weren't particularly good, nor were those famous people particularly well characterized, at least in the beginning. Most of the sequences with Napoleon were weak and overstayed their welcome. I would have done without him (especially the long waterslide sequence) and also with some lame sequences that really don't work. Not only that but the Napoleon actor obviously didn't really speak French. However, when the famous historical figures start interacting in the present, with the exception of Napoleon, the movie gets way more entertaining. It struck me how the second half was much more fun and inventive than the first, with the exception of Bill and Ted meeting themselves in the first part, that was a great idea. This reminds me that because it tells us outright from the start, you know that things are going to end well. I would have preferred less information so there would be at least some suspense (despite the fact it's a comedy). The special effects aged surprisingly well, even the time travelling parts. In the first half, I thought the movie was somewhat poor with a few snippets of enjoyment, and that perhaps time had altered my perception of it. Thankfully, the better second half, when the famous people get to the present, redeems it and makes it worth watching and not just for nostalgia's sake, although nostalgia does help.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)",6,2,3,26 January 2013
Cloud Atlas," Important thing to get into the Cloud
","Don't do like me and work too hard on guessing which souls are which in each time period, because it's almost always different 'soulmate' couples that are featured and a major character in one life might be extremely minor or even dead in another life. Tom Hank's characters are easy to point out, but it's not so easy for the other lesser-known actors. So, that being said, the stories take place in 6 time periods in different locations ranging from 1849 to 2321, 2 of which might be considered science-fiction. The characters in each story, that are alternating and not linear one after the other, are souls that reincarnate and are somehow linked together. Those 6 intertwined stories are simple easy-to-follow affairs provided you don't think too much about identities on the first viewing. By themselves, they are of different genres (comedy, drama, action, sci-fi, romance, historical) sometimes combining (example: sci-fi romance). They are interesting, but not great. Few of those would have the potential for a feature-length film.Cloud Atlas is a bold, ambitious project with decent directing by the 3 directors, but it's moderately successful in its impact. I didn't find it too confusing and sometimes even clever in how it transitioned. I think what doesn't help the emotional impact is that it's not the same couple of souls being featured in each time frame. Some might find it a strength, I felt as if it unfocused and hindered character build-up and evolution. I would have preferred more emphasis on 3 or 4 characters instead of the dozen there was, but I have to keep in mind it's a book adaptation and it probably worked better in book format. The acting was OK, nothing great, with the highlights being Ed Broadbent (the old guy) and the main Asian actress. It was a difficult undertaking, but sometimes the makeup really failed and actually detracted from story immersion (Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving, as that woman was horrible). The film is obviously a commercial failure and I find it silly to lambaste a film for that. It might become a cult film and I wouldn't mind seeing it again although I didn't adore it. I think it's worth watching at least twice.Rating: 7 out of 10 (Very good)",7,3,6,15 December 2012
Pineapple Express," Far from the best stoner comedy
","The two leads obviously had lots of fun playing stoners and the chemistry was good. I didn't feel the writing was as strong as in other Apatow/Rogen flicks, nor was it as funny. To be fair, I think it would be much more amusing for viewers familiar with weed (or on it... ;-). The action part of this comedy was OK although I can barely remember any of it now. I do wonder if it detracted instead of helped. It has a few inspired comedic moments but there were stretches, especially near the end, that were just so-so. Nothing much to say about the directing, as usual for those movies, it's competent but you don't really notice anything extraordinary. More a rental than a buy unless you're a Seth Rogen/Judd Apatow fanaticRating: 6 out of 10.",6,2,6,23 May 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," Subverting clichés for something original and fun
","Behind this cliché title and cliché premise hides something quite different and original. I repeat what everyone else has been writing about it, the less you know about, the better. I'll just expand a little on what made this so good in my own opinion. The main characters were not selfish jerks, they were actually likable, and you'll even root for some of them. Even though they fit in the standard horror character stereotypes, initially they were not and basically how they 'turned' into those stereotypes was cleverly explained. The all-around good acting: serious but not too serious, light but not parodic, certainly helped matters and kept the movie tone just right. Cabin in the Woods didn't take its viewers for imbeciles: it was smart, had a few humdinger plot twists and once again played with those famous horror clichés subverting them in the process. This movie actually explained most of them, but I can't tell you how.The directing was professional and easy to follow, even spectacular sometimes. There was a reveal about 3/4 of the way through(involving cubes), that had been hinted at previously that made this film mind-blowingly cool and paved the way for a seriously action-packed and unpredictable last act, something I've never seen in any horror movie and I've seen a lot. Horror fans will in fact probably enjoy it more because they'll get most of the references. Josh Whedon fans (Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse), will get a blast of seeing a few old familiar acting faces. It doesn't mean that non-horror aficionados won't enjoy it, too, because the Cabin is quite unconventional and it's not too gory compared to many other genre entries. To be fair, I found the movie way more entertaining than scary, probably because I'm too desensitized to the horrific aspects by now. I thought the jump scares and surprises were effectively done, although it's not a particularly atmospheric film. Weirdly, I think that Cabin in the Woods will become a genre-defining film. By that, I mean that I suspect it will become often referred to, whether or not the movie was liked, although I'm not sure how the concept could be done again in such a clever, fresh way.Rating: 8 out of 10 (very good)",8,3,15,15 April 2012
Moon," Like a great Twilight Zone or Outer Limits extra-long episode
","Moon is a contemplative psychological mystery sci-fi movie like we rarely see anymore. An astronaut lives at a base on the far side of the moon at a mining base, collecting and sending canisters of a precious isotope back to Earth. He has a 3 year-contract and in that time he lives totally isolated except for a robot companion and recorded messages from his wife. You see his life has become pretty much routine, until a certain accident... where he will meet someone looking very much like him... (not a spoiler : seen in the trailer).What would you do if you met someone like yourself when you thought you were unique ? That's not only food for thought but also a disturbing mystery. 'Moon' is slow to start but soon turns more and more intriguing. The strength here is in the storyline more than in the somewhat eighties-looking special effects. The effects are quite acceptable by the way and seamless when 2 particular characters are together. The night skies seemed a bit fake though. The biggest flaw I noticed was the reaction, or lack thereof, of the 2 main characters when they meet. That didn't seem real to me. Interrogations regarding their respective nature do occur but a tad too late.Other than that, Sam Rockwell did an amazing acting job and he keeps our interest high even when not much is happening. He also manages to convey the few dramatic moments quite well. Beyond the acting, it's the mysteries that keeps us watching, not only the big obvious one but also the mysteries of the human (and non-human) reactions to such unexpected circumstances. The robot companion is rather low-tech with his static smiley faces but with the soothing voice of Kevin Spacey and some surprising actions becomes quite a memorable character. The minimal soundtrack comprised mostly of simple piano is very good. Despite being outwardly sci-fi and seemingly cold like its namesake, Moon is a very intimate and human experience that deserves to be watched except for those who absolutely need lots of action.

Donnie Darko," Theories on why it became cult
","For some reason, it wasn't as good as I remembered although it does have its strong qualities. I think it became cult because of 3 of those in particular: the memorable confusing ending, the great eighties soundtrack and the central character who's a dark (;), troubled and rebellious teen. I should also say that the overall mysterious tone and 'impending doom' atmosphere helps a lot in its appeal. When that weird surreal guy in a rabbit suit with the freaky mask tells Donnie the world will end in 28 days at the very start of the movie, you want to know what will happen and the plot slowly builds up on the suspense while being clever enough to make you doubt Donnie's grip on reality. I quite enjoyed the jabs on American conservatism. Jake Gyllenhaal did very well portraying the awkwardness and ambiguity of Donnie. The secondary characters were all very good and you wish there was more with them (probably in the Director's cut which I haven't seen). It's definitely worth watching for fans of teen or quirky movies.Rating: 7.5 out of 10",8,2,6,23 May 2009
The Wedding Singer," Romantic reviewer's repetitive ramblings
","I just saw this after having watched it once long ago, probably back in the VHS days, late nineties. I think it's still incredibly charming and funny today (in 2011). I rarely laugh out in the movies, especially alone, but I did here. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are so likable in their respective lead roles. Weirdly, I think it's because they're shown to be really sweet and compassionate and from them it seems genuine. There's such a good chemistry between those 2 and you can't help, but root for them to somehow get together. Of course, several of the funny bits come from the usual Sandler's losing his temper bits. Lots of humour comes from contrasts or switching between moods (ex.: from nice or sad to angry and back again), especially the time Sandler sings his latest composition. You shouldn't laugh, because the lyrics are so grim, but because of his performance, you can't help yourself. Consider also how hilarious it is when he sings a famous happy song, but does it so desperately.You have an amazing soundtrack full of 80s songs that are thematically right on the spot and often quite amusing (especially that famous Boy George song). I was pleased at how generally good Sandler was with the frequent singing despite his few distinctive funny voice inclinations. From the credits, it's supposed to be him and it sure looks like he's really singing instead of lip-syncing. Lots of enjoyment also comes from seeing the (now) outrageous fashions and coiffures of the 80s, as well as the inappropriate things kids and grandmas will say and do. It's obvious people who were teens or adults in the 80s will get the most of the many references, but I do think younger people will also enjoy this very much for other reasons.The Wedding Singer, despite being a romantic comedy, is not that predictable or conventional if you consider, amongst other things, how both main characters start off in a serious relationship headed for impending marriage. I even found it quite touching a few times, almost shedding a tear near the end. Paraphrasing somewhat the start of the movie, some of us, like me, will likely never ever find true love, but it's nice to keep the illusion alive by watching such a sweet-natured and genuinely funny romantic comedy. The 80s setting is a bonus, but it's the heart and laughs that make it shine. It's also something I could easily see myself watching every few years with equal pleasure.Rating: 9 out of 10 (excellent)",9,2,2,27 November 2011
Warm Bodies," More original than you might think
","Finally the great zombie romance? Well, maybe not, but it's the closest I've seen. You get to see zombie life from the perspective of a zombie, who starts to get feelings for a girl who's alive. Through a set of circumstances, he 'rescues' her and they take refuge in a grounded plane at an airport overrun by the undead. There were several original elements that I had never seen in a zombie movie. First and foremost is the narration by our young zombie giving us insights into his condition. He can barely utter words, but weirdly, in his head, he seems smart and talks normally. I liked that part and I was kinda sorry when he got somewhat better at talking, therefore evacuating most of his thoughts. Second original element was the romance. I wasn't impressed by it, but at least it was slow-building, somewhat charming, avoiding most of the disgusting stuff, and you kind of rooted for them by the end.Third original element would be the zombies not stuck as they are. They can 'evolve' (our hero) or 'devolve' (bonies, zombies who shed their outer skins, looking almost like black ghouls or skeletons). Speaking of bonies, I thought they looked amazing, creepy even, but their movements were stiff and made them look computer-generated. Also, who knew that eating brains for zombies could be a way for them to live vicariously the past life of the person they ate, through visions. It's not even the only way they can 'change', although the other way, though nice, seemed a bit far-fetched and too quick. Fourth original element was that there was sometimes a humanistic, hopeful even, vibe to the proceedings despite the dramatic elements. There's something at the end involving the zombies and the bonies that I had never seen before. So the movie is more original than one might think, however the execution wasn't flawless.Sure, overall, I found the movie had charms, but for me the laughs were few and far between, like most romantic comedies I suppose. Because it's supposed to be one of those, but with obviously more somber elements. The drama could have used more 'teeth' to make this film truly memorable and moving though. The movie even made me think of Romeo & Juliet as well as Edward Scissorhands, not bad stories to be associated with. The creators never really went into total parody or silly mode, which I think was a smart choice. What really took me out of the picture at several occasions though is that they didn't follow their own internal rules. We're told by our hero that zombies can only shamble slowly, yet not long after, we see zombies running. It's like they can have bursts of speed at will. Also, bonies, for some reason, move fast despite being in a more advanced stage of zombification. Also, I know it's a short movie, but zombies 'evolve' too quickly, especially the best friend. Acting was fairly good, not exceptional, but I particularly liked the main character. Why? Because he's a nice, smart freak, quite lonely and having trouble to express his feelings in words and actions, but able to be slowly 'healed' by kindness and love. It made him interesting and relatable to me and probably others. Yes, the movie could even be seen as an allegory on solitude, not fitting in, and how hard it is to truly connect to others in modern society.Zombie makeup was rather minimal, and they managed to make the protagonist kind of attractive, in a goth-like way, mostly because of his great hair and pale blue eyes. I thought there were wasted opportunities with the concept, but it could have been done much, much worse. So, I liked the movie, I would even recommend it to most people not allergic to zombies to see a different take on them. It's very minimally bloody and the most 'gory' part is when they show a zombie shedding his skin to become a bonie, and even that's not too disgusting. I think it would make a good date movie. Warm Bodies didn't leave me cold and the more I dwell on it, the warmer my feelings for it get.Rating: 7 out of 10 (Good)",7,112,139,25 February 2013
