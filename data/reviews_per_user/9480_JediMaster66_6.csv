It," great
","When you're a kid, you think that you'll always be... protected, and cared for. Then, one day, you realize that's not true. If you open your eyes, you will see what we're going through. 'Cause when you're alone as a kid, the monsters see you as weaker. You don't even know they're getting closer. Until it's too late.IT is one of my favorite horror movies. this movie could have been a lot scarier than it is, but I still love this movie. when I first saw the trailer for this movie I really wanted to see it but that was weird for me because at that time I did not like horror movies but now horror movies are probably my favorite genre. I think this was the first horror movie I saw in theaters. I donÂ´t know how faithful this movie is to the novel because I havenÂ´t finished reading it yet. Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd is phenomenal as Pennywise the dancing clown and the soundtrack is great.",9,2,3,17 May 2020
