","This is a really classy affair. It's a thriller, a Sci Fi mind spinner, a romance and a first rate action movie. As well as all that its got a couple of cracking performances from the two leads. The film is very taut and you don't feel that there is any wasted time - every scene seems to matter. Look out for a delightful echo back to a film it resembles in some ways, the wonderful 'Groundhog Day', a knowing reference to 'living in the mountains'. Its even got a sublime feel-good ending. I've seen this movie three times already but writing about it makes me want to seen it again ... and again. Not to be missed.",10,0,2,18 August 2011
