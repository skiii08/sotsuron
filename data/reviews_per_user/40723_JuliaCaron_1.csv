Black Swan," Great Movie
","Natalie Portman was excellent, I truly liked the movie. I strongly recommend it. I loved the dance and the scenes. It was very captivating and intense. Sometimes scary, but really good. I just couldn't see another actress performing in the Black Swan. It felt like Portman was the only suitable actress for this role. I also believe that preparing for this movie involved a lot of ballet training, which I think Portman nailed. The costumes were superb. Another great characteristic of this movie is that it incorporated beauty and violence. Portman is a great actress to begin with, therefore she performed better than expected. She was able to express her emotions in a very unique and original way, which it definitely impressed me.",8,1,3,13 January 2014
