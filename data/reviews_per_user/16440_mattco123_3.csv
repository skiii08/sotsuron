Black Swan," Natalie Portman is fantastic as Nina - fantastic film all around
","There isn't much new I can say in my review that isn't already said here, but I just want to add to the chorus of amazing reviews for this film because I think it deserves it.Natalie Portman alone is so amazing in this film, it deserves a 10/10. As the movie progresses and she descends further and further into her internal struggles (both in her general life and in her taking on her role as the lead in the show), she embraces the role with a fervor like no other. And I simply was blown away by so many actors in this film - Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder - they all add to the dark atmosphere.Lastly, from a technical standpoint, the camera work maneuvering through the dance scenes was quite an amazing spectacle to watch, and I loved the shooting style and cinematography through the whole thing, but especially when they danced. The final scenes during the play were astonishing!It is also a film to watch more than once, because there is so much going on and so many little things that can be missed upon one viewing.Amazing! 10/10",10,2,5,4 February 2011
Crash," Crash is 'racism for dummies'
","This movie had some on the edge of your seat moments, but way more irritating moments. In my opinion, Ryan Phillipe, Sandra Bullock, and the guy plays her her husband are terrible actors.The dialogue at moments was CRINGE WORTHY.The movie tried too hard, the script is very 'Hollywood', and it just gets too precious as the movie goes on.There are better race relation movies out there - this one is like those 'Dummies' books, entitled 'Racism for Dummies'. We get it! Everyone is a RACIST! And then they have some sort of redemption. I'm so glad life works that way. How stupid do you think your audience is!One of the things I think independent movies have done better than big budget Hollywood is subtlety. The Hollywood movies have to constantly point everything out for their stupid beer guzzling audience who don't want to think.Crash had no subtlety. Horrible.",1,15,27,11 March 2006
Avatar," weakest story i have ever seen
","I honestly think it is sad that James Cameron really didn't think he needed to write good material just because the animation is so good in Avatar. The movie gets one star from me for that. And the movie is so long, the animation didn't even matter that much by the end.I also think it is sad that people don't even care for something better written.Seriously, this has to be one of the most nonsensical, holes in plot, unoriginal, clich√©d movie i have ever seen.I am not asking for masterpiece theatre here, but come on Mr. Cameron, did you stop learning how to write in grade three, and just learn how to make movies from there on? This has to be one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen.",1,12,23,15 January 2010
