E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," news on the movie ET
","What I want to know is there going to be a E T Returns? You know like E T comes back to earth after Ellot grows up with maybe kids of his own. my daughter has seen E T a million times and keeps wanting to know is there going to be a E T Returns to Earth. Please say there is. Jessie is handicapped and watches E T regularly each week. It use to be every day regardless of what we did, we had to see ET before she when to bed that night. This is one of those movies that kids or parents or just anybody never forgets. It makes you cry and laugh and then you want to see it all over again. I do not understand it says don't yell in your writing. You are total misunderstanding there is no yelling or shouting when I am just writing to you to see if maybe there will be a follow up movie. Thank You",10,1,2,27 March 2005
