Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Wassup, Will?
","About 30 minutes into the film, I realized that the use of Lincoln as the protagonist was really nothing more than a jokey gimmick designed to attract an audience to a Batman Begins movie set during the 1800s. Why else watch this movie except for the titillating idea of Abraham Lincoln perhaps having been involved in something from the occult? If you're going to involve an important historical figure in your work, I'd think you'd try to marry the history to the activity--what is it about vampire hunting that suggests a different bit of insight about Lincoln? Lincoln was a very formal man of his times. He certainly wouldn't have used the American language in the ways he does here. Nor do I see Lincoln as having the kinetic range of a Neo in Matrix. He was a tall man with a deliberate gait and not at all as animated as he's presented here. This is a character 'named' Abraham Lincoln, not 'being' Abraham Lincoln.I was bored because I was watching a substandard super hero comic book kind of movie. All that research supposedly done to convey realism was a waste of time and effort. Someone should have researched language and customs. I forced myself to stay through the train fight video game, then simply walked out on the film. I felt tricked into watching a bad movie that I wouldn't even pay a $1 for in the box.",4,5,12,24 June 2012
Argo," Quite suspenseful!
","Ben Affleck continues hitting them out of the park. Based on a true story, Argo re-enacts the events that freed American foreign service employees from their hideout in the Canadian Embassy. The setup involves Affleck's character, Mendes, putting together the cover story of a Canadian film crew scouting locations in the Mideast for a sci-fi movie. Alan Arkin & John Goodman are hilarious as Hollywood hotshots producing this surefire scifi hit. The process follows Mendes as he enters Iran and has to BS his way to some skeptical and hostile Iranian theocrats who almost don't know how to respond to the possibility of a scifi movie set in Iran. Mendes must also deal with frightened and reluctant Americans who are being forced out in the open to pose as a movie crew. Affleck does a good job of injecting suspense and dread all through this section.But the real nail biter is their exit from Iran. As in other movies of this ilk, the chase heats up with the Iranians on the heels of the Americans. Affleck throws into this chase a huge boulder of an obstacle when President Carter pulls the plug on the film crew ex-filtration & decides to go with Delta soldiers instead. If you want to know what happens, I advise you to see the movie or read the news accounts. This just goes to show you that not all CIA covert actions are led by armed fighters like Jason Bourne and launched by the Treadstone department. Affleck's character doesn't even carry a gun--he carries a script instead.",8,27,48,12 October 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimatum features Jason Bourne, professional agent
","This rates up there with Godfather in terms of successful 2 & 3-part movies. Their success has a lot to do with Matt Damon and both directors, Doug Liman (Identity) and Greengrass (sequels). While each movie can no doubt stand on its own, I can't imagine why anyone would want to see one without knowing the others. To appreciate Jason Bourne's full character arc, you have to start with the full amnesiac Jason, who Damon probably plays as David Webb--respectful, smiling at times, boyish--until he's put under pressure and Bourne takes over.Anyone seeing this movie cannot be late. The opening sequence in Moscow is thrilling and beautifully filmed. The pulsating Bourne music that accompanies him trudging the the snow, the camera focusing on his feet, is to die for. Those who know Supremacy well, immediately realize that we are being shown what happened after he confessed his misdeeds to Neski's daughter and left her apartment. He had been shot earlier by a KGB agent, whom he probably killed in a devastating car crash. The Moscow police are still after him, and Bourne must elude them. While this opening scene is not as incredible as the bridge/train chase scene in Supremacy, it is almost as intense. A perfect way to get you charged for this film.I happened to like the first half of this movie better than the last half. The scenes shot in Waterloo where he is trying to help a naive reporter who's been caught up in drama he doesn't understand is the perfect stage for a highly trained professional like Jason Bourne. This is his business. If you are ever caught up in a situation with Bourne, you'd be really stupid not to follow his advice. His instincts are always spot on.We also see a hollow man. His scenes with Nicky contrast sharply with those in which we've seen him with Marie. He picks up on Nicky's hint that perhaps they had a thing at one time, but Jason is still grieving Marie. And he now accepts that anyone associated with him is a target. Compare the scene in Identity in which he sat in a restaurant with Marie wondering why he would have a gun, multiple passports, and so much money in a safe deposit box to the scene with Nicky in the cafe where he is practically speechless and emotionless. Later, Nicky learns from Bourne that she'll have to run. She dyes her own hair and cuts it, too. Bourne once did that for Marie himself, after which they fell in love. Bourne simply escorts Nicky to a bus stop and sees her off.I wish Straitharn and Scott Glenn had switched roles. Glenn would have been a better villain against Bourne. He's a real hardass. Straitharn plays his role like he's a bookkeeper.I liked the Desh fight scene only because it showed Bourne as a professional at work, committed to destroying his adversary because it's his business. He doesn't recoil in horror after killing him, as he did in killing scenes in Supremacy. He's resigned himself to who he is as Jason Bourne, what he's forced to do to survive. And in the scene where he looks through Neil Daniels' burnt belongings, that big watch on his wrist, he looks like a g-man, investigating the evidence as he's been trained to do. He takes command wordlessly and imposes his authority instantly. This Bourne characterization is brilliantly played by Matt Damon, a character transformation as brilliant as Al Pacino in Godfather.Yes, you really have to see all of them to appreciate one of them fully.",10,5,10,13 August 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not really better than the original
","Why do an English language version of a stunning foreign film? There are all sorts of reasons to do so and good ones. Perhaps the foreign culture got in the way of Americans appreciating the story fully, or perhaps the film was not well distributed in English-language countries. The North American market is huge and there are plenty of dollars for a film that probably played mostly in art houses (e.g. Pour Elle became The Next Three Days--practically duplicates). Tattoo, however, had a robust DVD viewing, so it's not like it lacked exposure. And sometimes a director has a particular point of view that he or she thinks will enhance or illuminate the story -- perfectly reasonable. But I really cannot say why David Fincher took on a redo of this film. He brought nothing new to it. It's a copy tweaked here and there and not near as gritty as the original. And I'm not all that enthusiastic about some of the changes he made in Lisbeth's or Blomquist's character or in the story wrap up. The first hour is quite slow--I even nodded off for a few minutes. It picks up when Lisbeth and Blomquist finally begin working together, although this Lisbeth is somewhat more into Blomquist. Despite Lisbeth's severe goth look, it's not as hard and realistic as Rapace's. Rooney Mara is Hollywood Lisbeth. Rapace has more street cred,she wasn't pretty & looked somewhat boyish. I love David Fincher, think he's one of the best storytellers in film today. But I can't see compelling reasons for his efforts in this film. In any case, you'll enjoy the movie...again. But you won't leave the theatre in shock and awe.",8,18,39,20 December 2011
Collateral," Best opening sequence of the year
","Aspiring screenwriters should scrutinize the first 30 minutes of this film, a perfect Hollywood Act 1 if there ever was one. Everything important about the characters and the coming action is set up here. Note the discussion between Annie and Max re Darrow and contrast it with Max and Cruise's discussion of Darwin. Max criticizes Cruise for killing strangers, but Cruise shuts him up by pointing out Rwanda and Max's lack of indignancy over those deaths. Cruise rails against LA and prophesies his own death on the MTA by recounting the person who died on the train and looped around the route 6 times before anyone recognized the guy was dead. Cruise easily defeats Max's pompousness and fake superiority by seducing him with money, quickly bringing the man down to his level. When that body falls on his cab, the music changes, the roles are clarified, and we are into Act 2.This is such a perfect Hollywoood formula and crafted with the finesse of a real pro. Everything about the coming story is in those first 30 minutes--genius.",10,2,2,20 August 2006
No Country for Old Men," Blueprint for a film of quality
","I was hooked when Llewelyn (Josh Brolin)ambled across the wide-open brush to track an antelope he'd failed to kill in one shot and came across other prey that had been successfully dispatched. Is he any better than the sinister Shirgurh (Bardem), failing to help a dying man asking for water, or watching 'the last man standing' die under a shade tree? No Country gives us complex characters and a slow-drip plot spiced with shots of violence and humor. You recognize some patterns from Fargo--the wise Sheriff and his dolt deputy. And then the poor sap who really doesn't grasp the nature of the beast stalking him. The comic wife who is ultimately sacrificed because of the decisions of her spouse. But this is not cold, snowy Minnesota--it's a frontier, an old western frontier visited by the same kinds of violence that inhabited it originally. McMurtry's Lonesome Dove springs to mind--the evil stalking the frontier--Blueduck, or later, the blue-eyed Indian.Most comment on Javier Bardem's force of evil performance. I myself found him too much like the mindless Jason of those 13th flicks who always gets up no matter how many bullets you pump into him and who always disappears into the night. The real character in this film is Llewelyn whose smarts aren't smart enough ultimately, whose simple plan turns out to be everybody's downfall. No matter what anyone says, this is Josh Brolin's film and his subdued, ego-less acting might fool you into thinking that Bardem stole the film from him...but its Brolin's role that leaves the taste in your mouth.Tommy Lee Jones can do this type of role in his sleep. I would have preferred a more imaginative casting for the sheriff--Clint Eastwood would have been an intriguing choice, having to play an anti Dirty Harry.",10,1,7,9 December 2007
Unknown," Not as good as Taken, but mildly entertaining
","The first half hour of this film is excellent. Somewhat Hitchcockian in theme and atmosphere, the film focuses on Dr. Martin Smith, in Berlin with his wife for a biotechnology conference where he's a presenter. But his briefcase is left at the airport; he goes back for it...and there the fun begins.In many ways this movie reminded me of the Harrison Ford film 'Frantic,' in which Ford played a doctor visiting Paris to attend a conference. After checking in to his hotel, he loses his wife. Did he even have a wife? With everyone so skeptical of him, he has to investigate her all by himself, at some point picking up a young hottie who gets drawn into helping him. Unknown is the same thing, only different. The problem in in the second act where the story should be developed...convincingly. There are a number of twists, but they pop up too late and too abruptly so you end up guffawing at them. Despite those flaws, I did find it entertaining in spots and wouldn't mind watching it again...on DVD. Considerable acting talent was employed in this film. Liam Neeson, Bruno Ganz, and Frank Langella are la creme de la creme. I'm sure both Langella & Ganz knew the script was entirely working, but, hey, a payday is a payday. Taken, by comparison, is a superior movie. This film is like Frantic, the Bourne Identity, and the Long Kiss Goodnight all rolled together but not blended very well.",7,4,14,18 February 2011
Whiplash," Speechless with joy
","I could tell just after the first 10 minutes that this film was an extraordinary experience. It is both intimidating and inspiring, packaged in a intense brew of bloody notes. Although it is specifically about a drummer and his teacher, it speaks to anyone who has struggled to soar beyond the mediocre and is willing to sacrifice everything to get there.Wow. And my son thought I was tough as his Suzuki violin coach. While I would never go to Fletcher's extreme in shaping a musician, I do see his point. Too many people go at their craft half-heartedly and wilt under the faintest of criticism. Even worse, they become successful for unexceptional work product that only serves to limit their development. The look on the drummer's father's face when he watched his son playing and realized that his son was more than a drummer--he was a galaxy.",9,0,2,5 January 2015
50_50," Lame
","I looked forward to 50/50. I enjoy JGL's acting and thought I'd get a kick out of seeing him play a young guy who learns he has a very serious form of cancer that might take his life. One reviewer suggested that the film would remind you how every day is a gift. Being unemployed with bills, I needed that kind of reminder.I'm still depressed. I didn't think this movie was funny, insightful, touching, or distinctive. A young guy finds out he might die from cancer, his shallow girlfriend can't hang, but his buddy does and keeps his outlook positive by encouraging him to use his cancer to get laid. In most films, I can get lost in the story and film as a whole world. In 50/50, however, I always got the sense that these were actors running scenes and they were all strung together to voila! Make a movie. The relationships between characters were for the most part cliché--the annoying mother, the shallow girlfriend, the inhuman doctor, the loyal buddy. And, if I were facing death, I would probably request an experienced doctor and not allow to be a guinea pig for a 24-year-old trainee. But I gave this film 6 out of 10 because the last 20 minutes were indeed quite heartfelt. If I were you, I'd wait until this comes to red box near you.",6,11,24,1 October 2011
The Social Network," West Wing: Student Edition
","I knew I wasn't going to like this movie. It's about some snotty, elitist, privileged kids at Harvard who don't have to work at Pizza Hut to get through school so they have plenty of time to enjoy their lives and join social clubs that will ultimately populate the West Wing. No worries about health care here.But, curiosity got the better of me, and I finally broke down largely because of David Fincher whose storytelling abilities i admire, his films being favorites--Seven, Benjamin Button, Zodiac. Facebook does not quite fit the list. Although I hated the movie, largely because of its a-hole protagonist--I admired the filmmaking--the cinematography, musical score, and narrative flow were sublime. I hated the West Wing cadence of the dialogue and wonder if the actors had to be trained to talk that way. The only writer & filmmaker who can do that superbly in my view is David Mamet. Here--really, all the West Wing cast kept swimming before my eyes. The other problem with this movie for me--nobody likes an a-hole kid protagonist. The guy lied and stole ideas from friends and acquaintances--the American way. No wonder Goldman Sachs put so much of its blood money into the company.",7,0,1,19 January 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," First rate thriller
","I remember seeing the Bourne Identity at the movies, thrillingly shocked at the action scenes, for example an assassin swinging through a window, a car being driven down a flight of stairs. I was also impressed with Damon's moves--lightning fast chops and kicks that barely registered on the screen. I recommended this movie to many others as not your typical action movie.For some reason I put off watching the Bourne Supremacy until this weekend on video. I can't explain the reluctance to view it until now---perhaps I didn't believe a sequel could be just as good. Thank goodness I finally picked it up: the movie is not 'just as good,' it is superior. I have watched it three times now.First of all, the score is really superior and acts excruciating tension to the movie, particularly the chase sequence when Jason Bourne is finally forced to run on foot to elude capture. That chase sequence is the centerpiece of the movie and it is perfectly rendered, beginning with the telephone ring that awakens Jason from his recovered memory and into flight. The score is accompanied by a cacophony of yelling by the German police, which one could liken to dogs barking as the fox is hunted down. Just perfect. His flight through the brilliantly photographed Berlin streets and rooftops, profiled in long shots wearing black reminds you of Jack the Ripper flying through gas lit London. Damon gives an astounding performance as someone who doesn't have to ponder escape plans--he was so well-trained that his body simply does what it needs to do when it needs to do it.We have fewer and fewer good films these days, so I'm delighted when I can experience a well-crafted adult movie. I'm actually sorry that I can't re-experience the film for the first time--the adrenalin jolt forced me to my feet! Obviously you can tell I liked this movie and I look forward to another episode. I've enjoyed the way Bourne's character has been built--his reliance on maps and schedules, for example--makes you chuckle when he pulls a map out and hastily scans it for directions.Brilliant movie.",9,3,4,15 May 2005
V for Vendetta," Took me over a year to finally see it...
","...and then I loved it.Like Evey initially, I can be reluctant to step out of my comfort zone when it comes to spending a couple of hours watching a film. I'm committed to certain genres and disdain the rest, unwilling to sacrifice a guarantee of pleasure to a moment of risk. But when you watch as many films as I do, eventually you'll have to take a chance on a film that looks suspicious. I found the DVD V among the library at my son's house and packed it in my purse.The best gifts are the ones you don't expect. This was no fantasy along the lines of a Dragonslayer, but a modern depiction of revolution albeit with touches of Orwell. Grounding the movie were the two leads played by Natalie Portman and the incredible Hugo Weaving who play Evey Hammond, daughter of political parents who died for their actions, and V, the masked man, disfigured in a fire, victim of a Holocaustian event perpetrated by neo-Nazis. Their performances make this movie classic.I recall reading that Clive Owen, the lead actor in Spike Lee's Inside Man, at first rejected the role because his character was masked for most of the film. In fact, he was to be masked for all of it until Lee gave in and permitted him face time in at least a few scenes. Clive should be ashamed after watching Weaving's entirely masked performance in V. The second time I viewed the film, I paid close attention to Weaving's performance and marveled at how he created a character through voice and movement: the bow of the head, lift of the arms, intonation and body language--all this working together created one of the most memorable characters in film. Like Evey, you eventually find him irresistible...and admirable for his subversive ways.Natalie Portman's character goes through a complete transformation in this firm, from a passive, pretty little thing, fearful always of being caught, just like her parents, to a full-fledged revolutionary willing to commit to her ideals. She was born with the subversive gene, as V detects immediately, but she's spent her life so far suppressing it out of fear. He helps her bring it to life.As a youngster, I loved the films Zorro, The Lone Ranger, Robin Hood and now we have V. For those who, like me, rarely step out of their comfort zone--try to do so for this film.",9,2,8,24 July 2007
