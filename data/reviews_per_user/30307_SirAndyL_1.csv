The Rock," OH YEAH!
","Let me say this to begin with- I decided that The Rock was my favorite movie even before I had finished watching it. With a well arranged plot, and an original set of characters, this movie contains everything a good action movie should. Sure, the plot was excellent, but that's not what saves it from being typical. It's the characters. This movie is more about the characters than it is about the action, unlike most recent action films. They all have their own motivations for what they do, even the bad guy. They should seriously re-release this movie. It's  meant to be watched on the big screen. So, if you haven't seen this masterpiece, GO RENT IT NOW! I promise you, you're going to love it.",Null,2,3,23 September 2001
