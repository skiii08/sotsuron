Iron Man 3," After the twist I wanted to pull off my eyes with my bare hands
","It's a good action movie BUT oh my god, the 'twist' completely ruined it in my opinion. How could they do THAT?? Don't get me wrong, it's great acting all over but it's a huge letdown for IM fans.What a waste of potential after casting Sir Ben Kingsley (whom I am very fond of). Unforgivable, period. Comparable only to the Lost finale, ouch. Shame on you Drew Pearce and Shane Black! You should be arrested for that one, tight scheduled, could't think of a better script? I don't get it,it is plain wrong, very disrespectful to the true fans <ul><li>Go work with Damon Lindelof!!!!</li></ul>",2,2,4,19 May 2013
Cloud Atlas," Beautifully crafted box filled with a lot of nothing - visually interesting, nothing more
","It's a pretty movie, a feast for the eyes really. Soundtrack is also very nice and lots of good performances. Yet the story (which we know from the synopsis will show everything is connected) carries no punchline or at least I failed to see it. As I said, to me its just that which you know from the start, even before watching the movie - 'everything is connected'. Great, so how do you move from there? How do you deliver the punchline? To me there was none at the end of the 3 hour ride apart from the very premise.So, if you want to be visually dazzled and have a lot of time to spare, go for it. If you are expecting a punchline or twist, not so much. Oh and makeup, nice but kinda like the scooby doo cartoon - you just know it isn't for real, lol.Pretty overrated movie if you ask me.",3,2,10,28 December 2012
