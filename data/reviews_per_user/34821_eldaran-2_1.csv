Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Entertaining...but 'Classic' status is questionable
","Although I'm a fan of the series (which I do think is deservedly a classic work of art), surviving the hype for Episode 1 was still an effort. As my expectations dropped, I found that when I finally did see the film, I got what I expected.Overall, the movie was visually spectacular. The digital cinematography was awesome. Lucas really did make the worlds come alive.However, the characters are somewhat cardboard. Jar-Jar and his faux-Jamaican speech inflection was utterly annoying. Honestly, I didn't know what he said half the movie.I think the storyline was great, especially if you know a little of Star Wars lore. From this perspective you can truly appreciate the intrigue.The single most horrible part of the movie though was the explanation of the Force. I enjoyed the mystery of its presentation in episodes 4-6. To explain it as some kinda organism (Microcholorides?) that resides in all lifeforms was an absolute travesty to the mysticism that was The Force. I find no need explain away The Force by saying its derived from something akin to Mitochondria. I plead to Lucas: Why couldn't they just feel how strong Anakin was with the Force instead of having to quantify it with a blood test?All this aside...I thought the film was truly entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the force and lightsabers duels. Not to mention the uses of lightsabers that I'd only imagined. The choreography was spectacular, rivaling in my estimation even kung-fu movies. Darth Maul was awesome.I do hope that the series gets darker and less child oriented in the future. It would also be nice if they brought back Darth Maul and gave him more lines.",8,1,1,19 May 1999
