Catch Me If You Can," Busy but successful
","At the beginning of Catch Me if you Can. I felt that there was too much going on for this film to be successful. I felt that there were too many time switches back and forth and that maybe Spielberg had ruined a perfectly good movie trying to make it a Spielberg movie. However, fifteen minutes into the movie I became totally amazed. Great acting by DiCaprio, this part is an actors dream, however he plays it very childlike, and very believably(Amazing considering Leonardo is 28 and his character at one point is 17). Tom Hanks is very good. I was thinking on the way home that maybe a 'cooler' actor could have played Carl (Hanks character) such as George Clooney. However I realized that Carl makes too many mistakes to be 'cool' so Hanks fits the part. Christopher Walken does a great job. My vote 9/10. A great movie to spend an afternoon at the theater. If you don't agree with me, 'Knock Knock' (You will get that after you see the flick, and hopefully you will laugh)",10,1,1,30 December 2002
