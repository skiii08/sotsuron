Airlift," Super good movie ....Must watch
","The movie start with a good set of direction, but the only thing i might spoil is the song in the starting 10 min. itself. except this the movie is straight forward and focus more on the main theme rather than hoopla. Really good movie and show the capability that now Indian audience can relate and understand real life movies. Also it focus the reality of the events. Even though they just manage to tie up all the events properly and thus sometimes the movie feel loosely knitted. Some characters will really annoy u in the starting but overall direction and casting of the movie is very good. The movie also change the way in which the movies are male. Now the audience is becoming more hungry for the real event movie, and this movie is yet another effort that Akshay Kumar took in this regard.",9,0,0,6 February 2016
