Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Successful Reboot, That Be Our Path!
","After the third installment of the 'Pirates' franchise brought nothing but disappointment to the public, On Stranger Tides brings forth a fresh new sea breeze, and ultimately saves the series from drowning to Davey Jone's locker.For starters, I highly approve of the editing of characters, from the introduction to brand new pirates, to the goodbye of some unneeded luggage from the previous trilogy. Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlanda Bloom) overstayed their welcome in the first three Pirate films, and now finally we can be reassured with new, more interesting characters in Stranger Tides.Among the new crew, Angelica Malon (Penelope Cruz) is brought on board. Her phenomenal acting talent, as well as her attractiveness successfully take over Knightley's position, and actually represents a believable pirate as opposed to Governess Elizabeth Swan transforming into a pirate lord. Give me a break.Taking over for Davy Jones is the well-known, menacing Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Stranger Tides provides great depth into Blackbeard's true darkness, and in my opinion gives us one of the most truly evil antagonists in film.As for returning characters, what's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie without Jack... Pardon me, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Sparrow pretty much continues right where he left us off: in search of the fountain of youth, without his beloved Black Pearl, and still causing nothing but havoc among everyone around him.Also in search of the fountain is Blackbeard, showing no mercy towards his expendable men in order to obtain its power of eternal life. Sparrow tags along with Blackbeard, in hopes to somehow find the fountain before Blackbeard.And wait, there's more! Mermaids and zombies and Spaniards, oh my! On Stranger Tides gives so many obstacles for Jack Sparrow to encounter, and overall provides a thrilling adventure that is just as good as Curse of the Black Pearl. I believe the filmmakers made just the right moves to use the proper characters and just the right amount of action and adventure, which ultimately creates a believable story to follow and enjoy. The only question is, will there be a fifth Pirates movie to come, and can this same, simple flow be kept still for a new trilogy? Oh, and as always, stay after the credits.",7,0,1,26 May 2011
