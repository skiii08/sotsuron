Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The effects alone could have carried the movie even with out a story.
","The movie was excellent. I came away from the movie (at 2:30AM) wanting to get in line for episode 2. I guess I'll have to wait. Before it's release critics (i.e. people paid to disagree) were giving the movie a bad review. What I heard was it lacked the heart of the first three or there wasn't a character like Han or some other reference to the original three. It's a new movie, a new story, and therefore, should differ from the original trilogy. If it were the same then the complaint would be the movie wasn't original. Anyway, the effects alone could have carried the movie even with out a story. I enjoyed the story because it sets up the next two perfectly.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
