The Blair Witch Project," The Real Horror is in Your Mind
","Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard.  Dir., Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez.  Three student filmmakers get lost, hungry, and desperate in the chilly Burkittsville, Maryland woods trying to complete their 16mm, DAT, and video documentary.  The creepiest thing about this film is not the barely audible crackles and voices surrounding their camp, not the frenetically hand-held chase scenes, not the bizarre hanging effigies, rock piles, and twig bundle, but the film you might play in your mind hours after itÕs over, trying to fill in gaps and spots of darkness.  Every evening show has been jammed with underaged Ôteens who canÕt wait to see what all the fuss is about.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," China-Tibet Fun for the Whole Family
","Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor) discover prepubescent slave Anakin Skywalker's (Jake Lloyd) talents on Tatooine, winning him in a bet.  Meanwhile, the evil Nimoudians rade Theed with Sino-Tibetan traces in Nute Gunray's 'Chinese' accent and Natalie Portman's endless exotic costume changes as Queen Amidala. Avoiding RETURN OF THE JEDI's Muppet overkill, writer/director/exec. producer George Lucas returns to balanced entertainment and fun for everyone, especially Ani's podrace, Darth Maul's martial arts with double-lightsaber (Ray Park), and the droid army-Gungan battle sequences with accidental general Jar Jar Binks (body movement model and mush-mouthed Jamaican by Ahmed Best) being zany.  Music by John Williams.  Yoda and Samuel L. Jackson make appearances as Jedi Council, deliberating upon whether or not Ani is 'the chosen one'. Oh, but we know...",Null,0,1,6 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Love and War
","Trey Parker, Matt Stone.  The most vulgar movie ever created is a musical with Satan and libidinous lover Saddam Hussein scheduled to take over the world if the blood of two filthy Canadian comics Philip and Terrence is spilled on South Park, Colorado soil.  KyleÕs mom births the militant organization Mothers Against Canadians (MAC) to combat the terrible influence on American youngstersÕ fragile little minds after hearing the children cuss like sailors; Stan continues vomitting on his girl and taking ChefÕs advice; CartmanÕs head is fitted with a V-Chip to control his mouth; and Kenny, rejecting a baked potato transplant in the ER, is transported to a busomy paradise.",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
The Mummy," Action and Fun
","Late 1920s American explorer Brendan Fraser and amateur Egyptologist Rachel Weisz are followed by a band of plunderers to the desert's treasures and terrors a la Indiana Jones, with chuckles, epidermal scarabs, blood-sucking freaks, zany Arabs, and big sand SFX (co-producer Patricia Carr). Co-starring a scary Arnold Vosloo.  Fun.",Null,0,0,6 June 1999
Notting Hill," Nothing Here
","American movie star pops into spasmodically-blinking Hugh Grant's little travel book shop in a suburb of London.  Soon, they dine with friends, have it on, and get caught off guard by paparazzi flash bulbs--something with which Mr. Grant is familiar--but not without getting to know one another. Acting:  B-; premise:  F+.  You know this one's full of itself when slo-mo shots and pics of Julia illuminate and fade during Elvis Costello's spewing opener, 'She'.  The ones to watch aren't the headliners (Hugh Bonneville, Emma Chambers, James Dreyfus, Tim McInnerny), especially the nutty flatmate (Rhys Ifans).  These actors could have made a good movie without Richard Curtis and Roger Mitchell, called 'Four Dinner Guests and a Welshman'. Tee hee.",Null,0,0,6 June 1999
American Pie," We'll Just Tell Your Mother We Ate All of It
","Jason Biggs, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Chris Klein (ELECTION). Four high school guys agree to get laid on prom night, but find out itÕs a lot harder than it seems.  Every single joke is about sex, and although Eugene LevyÕs knitted black caterpillar eyebrows and facial contortions as the concerned dad Ñ using porn mags to teach his son about the birds and bees Ñ are always a hoot, the filmÕs about-face tone shift from chicken-choking to earnest and sensitive arrives too late.  Or maybe IÕm just getting old.  Co-starring Playboy pinup Shannon Elizabeth as the exotic Eastern European exchange student and Natasha Lyonne as the husky-voiced, world-wise yenta-widda-heart.  And what late-90s 'teen sex movie is complete without a 'Third Eye Blind' tune?",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
For Love of the Game," NO HITTER?
","Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly.  Detroit Tigers 19-year veteran ace pitcher goes against the NY Yanks one last time for that perfect game, flashing back in the dugout and on the mound with memories of boyhood catch with dad in Super-8, tender moments with opposing and fellow players off the field, and, especially, the on-again/off-again romance with magazine writer and single mom Kel.   Can 40-year old Kev come out a winner?  Sam EVIL DEAD Raimi successfully uses a variety of techniques (but not TOO many!) to capture the excitement of live and televised baseball with focal point Kev (and he wouldnÕt have it any other way) bearing all sorts of crosses including age, selling of the ball club, retirement, a relationship in the bottom of the 9th, etc.  This sappy Kev-fest works with the help of RaimiÕs reserve and Basil PoledourisÕ impassioned synth soundtrack, driving us to a nail-biting crescendo with our own living legend Vin Scully calling the play-by-play.",Null,0,0,11 September 1999
The Red Violin," A Very Expensive Fiddle
","Dir., Francois Girard.  A 300+ year-old violin passes through the hands of its Italian maker, a sickly young German protege in Vienna, a sensual English superstar virtuoso who looks like Carrot Top with sideburns, and a female Party member in Mao's Shanghai.  This overlong, dull, contrived cut-and-paste job overlayed with fortune-teller narration masquerades as an intricately woven Euro-saga (even composer John Corigliano couldn't make it sound important), and it should have been called '32 time shifts for nothing'.  The only saving graces are Joshua Bell's astonishing solos and Jean-Luc Bideau's performance as the boy's teacher.  Co-starring Greta Scacchi and Samuel L. Jackson.",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
