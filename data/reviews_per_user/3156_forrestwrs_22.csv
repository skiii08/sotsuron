National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Nothing Is Too Insulting To Our Intelligence
","National Treasure 2 is a carbon copy of the first movie with a couple of new actors sprinkled in there. First of all, I could not even by into this movie. The premise behind the first movie was 'Let's go find the largest treasure in our nation's history!' The premise behind this movie was 'Let's go find the *second* largest treasure in our nation's history!' I had a hard enough time swallowing the plot of the first movie. This movie's plot went beyond silly and landed in the territory of stupid.There's just too many ridiculous plot points that the filmmakers were trying to make us swallow in this one. The characters gave the same dull performances in this movie as they did in the last movie. The difference is that not even Jon Voight or Justin Bartha really put in a lot of effort this time.And where as I found the screenplay in the last movie to be one of the better portions of the movie, here it was just absurd and astonishingly bad. Everything was pretty predictable and the screenplay never stopped throwing bullshit at the audience. 'Ben's relatives helped assassinate a president! You don't care? You should! And all of the presidents kept a diary of everything they did in office! That could have been helpful to historians? Well, it wasn't!' Nope, nothing is too insulting to our intelligence evidently! The worst part of this movie is the action, or the random running and screaming and chasing the movie tries to pass off as action. It was a degenerating factor in the first movie, and the same applies here.Whereas I had been forced to watch the first movie in my high school history classes (because the movie mentioned history I guess?), I got the opportunity to see this picture in theatres (they took us on a field trip to see it because, I suppose, there are some historical figures mentioned at some point, right? I got nothing...). One of the worst theatre experiences I have had. It's loud, it's corny, it's cheesy, it's stupid, it's a mess, and it's incredibly bogus action for an 'action' movie. I put the word 'action' in quotes because i really couldn't buy this as an action movie in any sense of the word.2/10",2,1,1,13 September 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," We're--Somehow--Supposed To Care
","I always admired Hugh Jackman, but X-Men Origins: Wolverine was doomed from the get-go. I think centering a whole movie on what I consider to be an overrated character was a poor choice for the first X-Men Origins story.The biggest flaw with this film was the idea behind it. I can imagine the appeal behind this character; he is dark, mysterious, and fairly bad-a**. Still, I couldn't imagine him being someone to do a whole character study on, and after seeing this film, I can see that I was right. I feel no emotional or intellectual connection with this character. He's not all that interesting, and I can't even feel humanly concern for him since he, apparently, cannot die. Usually the godlike character is the villain in the movie, but in this film, we're—somehow—supposed to care about and support him.The action sequences weren't all that much to look at either. For starters, the special effects look like they were taken out of a Twilight movie. They were awfully computer generated and that really cut down on the entertainment factor for me.We are also subjected to just about every cliché in the book. The biggest one was when an explosion happens and Wolverine walks away as though he didn't notice. Yeah, we know you're bad ass, but now we also know you're a pretentious prick.Basically, this movie is a character study on an incredibly uninteresting character, one we can neither identify with nor care for.And the god-awful effects really didn't help at all.3/10",3,0,2,14 September 2010
X-Men," Startlingly Fun Movie To Watch
","X-Men surprised me with its intelligence, marvelous direction, and wonderful characters.A startlingly fun movie to watch, X-Men is one of the better comic book adaptations out there. In fact, I'd say it was the best one made until Spider-Man came out. Even then, it's a close call. X-Men does really well with balancing the terrific number of characters it features on screen. I think this is the movie's best aspect. It gives us a lot of depth to every character on screen. Including Wolverine, who I was not pleased with when I saw X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It's a little ironic that there was more depth given to Wolverine in a film that was not strictly about Wolverine than the 'character study' film did that was supposed to be solely about Wolverine. I started to feel an interesting connection to this character. This is incredibly important because this is the first time I had ever thought much of anything for Wolverine, including in other films, TV shows, and comic books. Excellent development.I was even more impressed with some of the side characters, like Rogue. Rogue was portrayed beautifully by Anna Paquin. I was unprepared for the level of intensity that this young actress was able to bring to the table with her character. She seemed frail, but independent. Strong and weak at the same time. And there was so much emotional strength given to her that by the time we got to the climactic battle, I was genuinely concerned for her. I also really loved the friendship that was played out between her and Wolverine. It was done extremely well and the two shared some really impressive scenes.Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey were a little underplayed, but I was still satisfied with the level of character development that we still got from them. I was able to take all these characters seriously and I was able to follow each of their own inner struggles in a way that, again, I had not anticipated.Ian McKellen was yet another surprise for me as Magneto. I had never held much stock in the villain, believing him to be nothing particularly special. And when I saw the old man who was to play him, I couldn't hold back my scoff. But the surprises kept coming through and I couldn't help but love this guy's performance. He plays the villain Magneto very well, giving a powerful and poignant performance. That's nothing to scoff at.And while I am talking about the actors and characters, I cannot forget Patrick Stewart who played Professor Xavier. I think this was the best performance in the film. Patrick Stewart really brought this character to life, giving the audience an incredibly powerful performance. There was a scene when he was talking to Wolverine and Cyclops and I suddenly realized I was leaning forward in my chair to hang onto every word this guy had to say. A brilliant and underrated performance.Then there were the incredible visuals in this story. Whether they were all CGI or not I did not know and neither did I care. This film was still made before everything had gone to such gargantuan lengths in the computers and I could tell the effort that was put into the visuals. And they looked really darn good.But what impressed me still more than anything else about X-Men was the direction. This film was directed by Bryan Singer, and he gives the audience some really intense direction. I was blown away by the cinematography among everything else. Singer is a wonderful director. I haven't seen any of his other films, but I want to now.X-Men is an entertaining and--above everything else--fun ride that is sure to grasp comic book fans and non-comic book fans alike.9/10",7,3,5,14 September 2010
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump Rocks The Boat
","I must say that one of the best movies I've seen in the past ten years has got to be Forrest Gump. The writing alone is more than anything than I could have thought, even after hearing so many people quoting the movie and Forrest. As far as acting goes, Tom did a wonderful job as Forrest. However, I must admit that sometimes Forrest's narration got slightly annoying. Nevertheless, all of the actors in the film did a wonderful job. A particularly surprising performance by the Actress that played Jenny sticks out in my mind.The editing was good, although I think it could have been slightly shorter. But there isn't enough wrong with the editing to complain about. The characters were all made to immediately grasp the audience's attention, which is what happened moments after they were introduced.None of the music really sticks out, but it definitely wasn't anything to complain about. The overall mood of the film, though, is what really helps bring it together. I was half afraid I might let a tear slip close to the end of the film; not really because Jenny dies, but more because of how happy Forrest is just having the life that he does with his son. And as he flashed back to the scenes on the boat, in Vietnam, and his running as he looked at the different skies at different times of day, I realized the beauty that the film makers were trying to capture through the eyes of this slightly retarded man.All in all, I could really not ask for much better of a film.",10,2,5,29 May 2007
Armageddon," The Michael Bay School Of Film
","Armageddon was a cheese ball of a mess. Michael Bay must have worked extremely hard to make sure this movie was about as god-awful as he could get it.I'll start out with Mr. Bay. The Michael Bay School of Film has three rules: Rule#1: Have stuff go wrong *constantly!* It raises tension and totally never gets annoying or takes away from the storyline! Rule#2: Explosions are good! Put in lots and lots of explosions! Rule#3: Move the camera constantly! Like, every single darn shot! Never ever pause to look at anything or develop a scene! No, we don't have the time for that stuff! A lot of the disaster in this disaster flick was really confusing. The scene where the space shuttle is destroyed and everyone inside it dies was pretty cool, but I had to rewatch that scene twice to see what the heck was going on and who was even in the shuttle.Now, I won't start bashing the movie for being scientifically inaccurate. I can let a lot of that slide. I'm watching this to be entertained, not taught. Of course, it could at least entertain me. That would be nice. And a lot of the movie had moments where I was going 'Okay, no. That's where I draw the line.' For instance, they knew 18 days ahead of time that this asteroid was coming? If you know *anything* about astronomy, you know that it's extremely difficult to predict when an asteroid is going to hit the earth. You have a better chance of predicting next year's weather forecast. But what really struck me was that the movie was really predictable. I won't give away the ending, but halfway through the first act, you're probably aware how it's going to end anyway.As for the screenplay and storyline itself... holy god what a mess. First of all, through the first half hour of the movie I was going 'Okay, it'd be nice if you would slow down and take some time to develop some of these characters. Or at least let us learn something about them.' And then he did slow down. Way too much. He just decided 'Screw it,' and didn't take his story *anywhere* for a good half-hour or so.And then he brutally forces a lot of the emotion in the movie. It's like in those retarded spoof movies where the filmmakers are going 'Laugh, darn it!' except Bay is saying 'Cry, darn it!' To give it credit, there was the scene with Will Patton and his ex-wife that was actually pretty well done. Of course, the scene barely finishes before we cut away from it (in fact, I'm pretty sure the scene wasn't quite done yet). What does he cut to? A strip club. Thank you for that, movie. I didn't start watching this to see a drama about an asteroid destroying the earth. No, I wanted to see a strip club! Continuing on, the characters were really poorly developed. A good example is Ben Affleck's character. I mean, why am I supposed to care about this guy?? He's obviously incompetent, makes all the wrong choices, and he's kind of a douche bag. He really is just useless. Am I supposed to care about him because he's in love with Liv Tyler? I'm really not sure why she is anyway, except because, as Bruce Willis even says early on in the film, she 'doesn't have any other options.' This brings me to the acting. God did these actors suck. I really expected a lot out of Willis. I look at Die Hard and Pulp Fiction and I think, 'okay, he's going to give a good performance.' But, he really doesn't. I mean, for the first act of the movie he has some non-descript accent. And then he loses it as the story progresses. Then there's Liv Tyler. At least now I know where Kristen Stewart learned how to act for the Twilight movies. Tyler's entire performance was based on moping and never ever changing her facial expression. As for Ben Affleck, he sucks. Plain and simple. He was annoying, I hated his character, and he just sucked.There were a couple of redeeming actors, however. Steve Buscemi actually gave me some entertainment from his on screen persona, and Will Patton seemed to put in some effort and try. I'll give them points for giving decent performances.Another very redeeming quality from the movie was the music. The soundtrack was awesome. I really just wanted to turn off the picture and just listen to the music. But, alas, I could not.As for the special effects--the Oscar nominated special effects, no less--they were really cool. But they were also done in a hurry. We'd see about seven seconds of special effects and then the movie would get ADD and start filming stuff falling down somewhere. The cameraman just didn't seem to be able to stick with the scene no matter how hard he tried. Ever.Frankly, this is one of the worst directed movies I've ever seen. There's hardly anything entertaining about it and the main character seems to be the $4 million explosions rather than Willis, Affleck, or Buscemi. And the characters were extremely hard to keep track of, the action sequences were thrown together haphazardly, and a lot of the logic in the movie was just bulled together. The movie was just bad. Disjointed, campy, incompetent, and bad bad bad.2/10",1,4,9,13 September 2010
Pearl Harbor," Appalling.
","Appalling.Four minutes into the movie, Michael Bay starts with the cheesy lines and overblown melodrama. What is with this guy and his cheesy overblown melodramatic romances? He's making George Lucas look like Shakespeare and James Cameron look like Michael Curtiz. This movie is an abomination. Michael Bay is romanticizing what's happening on Pearl Harbor, using and manipulating this dreadful events for his own advantage to sell tickets. He throws in cliché after cliché and never once tries to tell a story. And he rips off greater directors and their films rather than trying to make his own. For instance, is it just me, or does the dogfight earlier seem vaguely familiar? He's ripping right off Star Wars! I'm not talking borrowing tiny elements or being vaguely familiar, I'm talking ripping right from the movie, almost shot for shot! And even using the same lines! Halfway through this movie, I had to ask myself one question: is Bay really using the tragedy at Pearl Harbor as a tool for this romance? I'm assuming he was trying to show how this tragedy affected real people, but this movie is way more about the romance than it is about the bombings! I feel like he *wants* to put the human element in, but he's not! He's completely removing it by giving us so much horrible melodrama. There is just this constant bombardment of melodramatic nonsense! Would it be so much to ask for him to at least stick to one story by the way? Half the time he's giving us this beyond-cheesy romance, but then he'll randomly cut to the Japanese military and US intelligence. Stick to one story! It kind of depletes the purpose of having us fear for the attacks if he's going to show us when and exactly how the Japanese are going to strike. He does not know how to balance the war aspect of this movie with the romance aspect. He either needs to stick to one or the other and not try to do both! And he rips off so many great movies it is pathetic. Bay very blatantly tries to rip off James Cameron's Titanic, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and George Lucas's Star Wars. Unfortunately, he has none of Cameron's eye for visuals, Spielberg's finesse with emotion and camera-work, or Lucas's talent for characters and action. And here is something else I noticed while I'm stuck on the director himself: he does not give the audience a sense of what it was like to be on board any of the ships before bombing them. So, we don't really feel an emotional connection to the ships or anyone on-board. By the way, Mr. Bay, could you please stop moving the camera? I feel like the movie is drifting away from me!! Now then, as I said before, I don't feel like director Bay or screenwriter Randall Wallace did their military research before starting filming. Did pilots ever play chicken with the enemy? I highly doubt that. And I really hated the way he made the pilots seem stupid, not knowing their right from their left. It is very obvious to me that he did none of the proper research for this movie.Pearl Harbor has one of the worst and most awfully clichéd scripts I've ever heard in my life. These lines that the actors have to say are just plain god awful, no other way around it. I seriously think Bay was trying to squeeze as many clichés as possible into the first half hour. In the first half hour of the movie, I counted no fewer than twenty clichés. I mean, this screenplay was just embarrassingly bad. There's no other way to say it. He should be ashamed of this screenplay.As for the actors in this film, I hated them all. I didn't enjoy watching them on screen, they were stupid characters, and none of them carried any kind of emotional authenticity with them. They were all as shallow and selfish and pitiful as any character I've ever seen on screen. We're given no other reason to care about any of them other than that they are in love with each other.And why does this movie hate women so much? I have never seen a movie that hated women as much as this movie does. All the women in this movie want are men. They joined the military to meet men. And every time we see a woman she's talking about men. Are these women really that shallow? All they ever talk about is sex and men! And then in the operating room, they're all just incompetent and panicky. Why does Bay hate women so much?? Now, I am going to give this movie a point for some pretty decent art direction and visual effects. Doesn't have anything on Saving Private Ryan, though. And I really wish this movie had paid as much attention to its dialogue, story, characters, historical accuracies, and general logic as it does to its effects and art direction. In fact, everything else about this movie is so bad that by the time we get to those scenes, I don't even care about them. And Bay doesn't really give us a whole lot of time to look at them. He's just running everything around too haphazardly.Also, the visuals are pretty good, but I don't feel like I'm a part of this war like I did with other war films.Bay epically fails with his monstrosity of a motion picture Pearl Harbor. This is among the worst films I've ever seen. Even its good portions-like its music and art direction-are dragged under by the weight of the horrible direction and writing. What the audience is left with is a movie whose good parts are still degenerating factors because they were used merely to try to distract the audience from all its other short-comings.1/10",1,14,23,12 September 2010
Twilight," Epically Fails
","Let me begin just by saying that I hated this movie. And I do mean I *hated* this movie. Why? Was it really that bad? Cinematically, it was subpar at best. It barely reaches the mediocre level. As a fantasy movie, romance movie, vampire movie, and/or action movie, it's just about as bad as it gets. It tries and epically fails to be all of these at once.Our main characters cannot properly display emotion. And there is less chemistry and acting ability here between these two 'lovers' than between Anakin and Padme from Star Wars. (Also, at least George Lucas attempted meaningful dialogue between them, unlike here.) Where is the romance here? Where's the romantic chase?The special effects in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen. Many times, it is painfully obvious that they just sped up the film. Just because you *can* use CGI doesn't mean you always should! The dialogue is cheesy and stilted at best. There is absolutely *no* character development. Plus, there are characters in this movie that don't even have a purpose (such as Bella's father and friends).I'd like to say that they did, at least, try to put some effort into this movie, but I really don't think they did. I think the film makers in this case just thought that they could just throw in a good looking guy in pale make up, give the characters the names from the books, and throw in a couple plot points and they'd be able to sell this miserable excuse of a movie to every Twilight pre-teen girl fanatic in the country. Of course, it worked.1/10",1,7,9,12 September 2010
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," The Lost World--Found to be Amazing
","If I had to make a list of the best sequels of all time, this would be near the top of the list. The original Jurassic Park movie was good and this one was nearly as good. This is also one of the few films that I believe had special effects just as good, if not better, than the first. Most film makers get lazy and overestimate their computer effects.Acting was fantastic by Goldblum again, just as in the first. The heroine had good acting as well, and it is easy to see why this movie jump-started Vince Vaughn's career.The originality of the screenplay may be iffy, but the quality of the lines written was more than good enough to make up for it in my opinion. (One of my favorite moments in the film is when Ian says to Hammond's nephew 'You know, whenever you try to sound like John Hammond, it comes out as a bit of a rush. But don't worry, they say talent skips a generation so, hey, I'm sure your kids are going to be sharp as tacks.') All in all, I think this movie just barely falls short of the first in writing, but beats the original in suspense. Just plain a good film!",8,1,2,30 May 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Left An Ugly Taste In My Mouth
","X-Men: The Last Stand left an ugly taste in my mouth by its close. I was so in love with the previous two movies, but then this one failed to do what the first two succeeded so brilliantly at doing. First of all, the characters in Last Stand were not balanced well at all. The way the characters were balanced was what was so impressive about the first film, but that seems to have been, unfortunately, abandoned. I kept wanting more out of these characters, and I wasn't getting that.***Warning: Here There Be Spoilers*** I also want to take a minute to talk about the way the deaths of some of the characters were handled. It wasn't so much that they died but where their deaths were placed in the story. Cyclops is killed off entirely too early, before the audience even has a chance to become acquainted with the pains he has been feeling. Yes, character developments have finally taken a backseat to action and effects in the X-Men movies. But I also disliked entirely what they did to Rogue. By the end of the film, she has given up her powers. I thought one of the most interesting stories of the last two films was Rogue's and the way she had to try to have a relationship with Iceman when she couldn't touch him. But instead of working out this problem, the writers take the easy way out and give her the Cure instead. Rogue was one of my favorite characters, but Last Stand turned her into something I did not like. ***As for the rest of the characters in this movie, I think the writers (Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn) tried too hard to balance too many characters. And they don't. Characters sporadically enter the movie and drop out, we're given no time with any of them, and the film doesn't even try to keep their story lines straight. For instance, there was a very interesting character known as Angel with wings growing out of his back. He appears in the beginning of the film, once briefly in the middle, and once even more briefly at the end. I wanted more time with this character. I wanted to learn something about him. No luck. And there was a lot of that going on.As for the main villains, our 'Class 5' mutant is entirely too powerful. She can lift a house and rip people apart. She can nearly destroy an entire island. Why was there even that final battle? She could have obliterated all of the opposing mutants like they were nothing. This was a very unnecessary addition to the movie that just left the film with an overabundance of plot holes. And there is no focus to this story. None of the characters are given the attention they deserve, and there were some fairly interesting characters in this film, including Beast.As for the final battle, I was disappointed. There was not a lot of intelligence put into the battle; instead it was full of more explosions than anything else. I didn't think Brett Ratner did the mutants justice with the battle. The one scene that shows that best was the battle between Pyro and Iceman. I was really excited to see this battle. We had seen plenty of evidence of the great power exhibited by both mutants already, and I knew that it would be epic. It wasn't. Ratner did not take this battle *nearly* as far as he could have. It could have been great! But instead, the two mutants just have a brief tug-of-war type fight and then it's over.The screenplay was the biggest problem with The Last Stand, but Brett Ratner did not do his job either. It's sad because I have liked three of Ratner's other movies and I expected good from him here. I had seen him do some great work in the first two Rush Hour movies and Red Dragon, but his direction style is disappointingly dull in The Last Stand. I expected more out of him. I didn't get it.I wasn't even all that impressed with the special effects in this film. I thought they were wonderful in the first two movies, but all special effects after 2003 look entirely too CGI, and The Last Stand is no exception.I was disappointed and disheartened by The Last Stand. I was left wanting more out of the X-Men series rather gaining any satisfaction from it. I want to see an X-Men 4 with Bryan Singer back as a screenwriter and director because I want some great character work done again. X-Men: The Last Stand was not the kind of X-Men movie I wanted.4/10",4,2,3,14 September 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," At Least Show Me You're Going To Try!
","Show emotion please!! Jesus! Emotion! At least show me you're going to try! Pattinson, nothing! Stewart, less than nothing! Lautner, wrong emotions! I've seen more emotional variety on a cereal box. And better special effects, too! I should have known better than to sit through this movie, seeing as I thought the first one was god-awful. But I did anyway. I guess I thought that maybe there was no way it could be as bad as the first film. Wrong! It was actually worse! The coolest part was the title sequence. After that, everything went downhill fast. More accurately, it fell out of a plane.We have a story filled with plot-holes, to start with. My biggest problem with the psychology behind this movie (and I do mean a *huge* problem) is that the audience is never explained why it is bad to become a vampire. I mean, you can live forever, you stay young, you get cool powers, why wouldn't you *want* to be one?!? And everyone you bite is just going to turn into another vampire anyway! And is it just me, or for vampires and werewolves who have a hard time being discovered, aren't they a little quick to pounce on the human characters? A paper cut and the vampire pounces. A couple insults and the werewolf transforms.In this film, we are introduced to our (poorly computer generated) werewolves. Actually, they're just kind of like large wolves. We get a 'romance' between Stewart and Lautner in this film. I put the word romance in quotes because, just as in the previous film, there isn't much to base the romance on. I will give them credit, the two 'lovers' did have some dialogue this time, but she doesn't even decide to go with him, so it doesn't count.The effects were awful. If CGI effects were overused in the previous film, in this film they were used excessively! For instance, instead of filming a person jumping into some water, they use CGI! Why?! Is it really necessary?! And the plot is almost nonexistent. They didn't even try! Just as in the last one, the film makers knew that to sell tickets they just had to put a good looking guy in the film with no shirt on and girls would come in herds.I hated this film, almost more so than its predecessor. I hated hated this film! The acting was terrible, we go through no change of emotion (let alone character development) throughout the entire movie, there is hardly any plot, the action sequences were lousy and poorly conceived, the dialogue was cheesy at its best, and the whole tagline of the movie could have been 'See topless guys! Buy tickets!' And next time, Stewart, at least try changing your facial expression at some point during the movie! 1/10",1,9,12,12 September 2010
Transformers," The Robots Were Astonishingly Bland
","I found myself liking the first third of Transformers and being completely disengaged with the film after that.I think that the best choice Michael Bay has made in his entire film career was putting Shia LaBeouf in the lead role of this film. I'm not going to swear to this, but I felt like he was improvising at least half of his dialogue. Which is great, because the screenplay was not very interesting at all. I found myself enjoying everything that LaBeouf's characters said more than any other part of the movie. He's funny, quirky, and, surprisingly, a decent actor. I first saw his work in Holes and then again in Disturbia. I must say that I feel like LaBeouf is on his way to making some really excellent work in the future.Megan Fox, on the other hand, was less than satisfying. Everyone has been talking about how pretty she is and, yes, I think that's the only reason she was in the film. Her character was completely unnecessary to the story and could have been taken out entirely. But, instead, the audience gets about a thousand shots of her 'looking hot' and very few shots of her actually doing anything important with the story. Still, even though I don't think she's a very good actress, I had to admit that her acting was still much better than Liv Tyler's in Armageddon or Kate Beckinsale's in Pearl Harbor. She's not a *bad* actress, but she doesn't offer any meat to the story beyond being a love interest for LaBeouf's character.As for the character development in general, I didn't see any. Unsurprisingly. I didn't expect any, and I didn't get any. But, here's my biggest issue with that: these robots should be interesting. But they aren't. These robots probably make up for most of my criticism with this film. The special effects were really good (*really* good), but the robots were astonishingly bland. And I thought they looked ugly. Believe it or not, I thought there was *too* *much* detail to them. There were so many chunks of metal sticking off of them that it made them all hard to recognize. Yes, that was a big complaint I had with the film. Except for two of the robots, they all looked the same! I had no idea what robots I should be rooting for during the fight scenes. I felt like they all were Megatron fighting Megatron. The only two robots I could recognize were the yellow one and Optimus Prime. And that's only because they were different colors from the other robots. I mean, this was not a very good-*looking* film. That surprised me, because Bay's films are at least fairly decent with the art direction, but not here. The colors were too saturated in some places, but not when it came to the robots. And, like I said, all the robots looked the same to me.And I wasn't very impressed with the action sequences either. I felt like there wasn't enough coherence to it. It was a lot of stomping around and not a whole lot of anything else. And the action starts about halfway through the movie and doesn't stop until the film's over. The rest of the characters in this movie, apart from LaBeouf and the robots, didn't really serve a purpose for the story. There were a few characters who I didn't even know why they were getting screen time. The movie dips in and out of the main plot line at a ridiculous rate. There's an interrogation scene for two characters. I was confused because I had no idea what purpose they were serving. I didn't know why the scene was even in the film.If I had to sum up Transformers, it would be that there was a lot of decent effects surrounding incoherent action sequences, ugly robots that looked the same, useless characters, little plot, cheap dialogue, and not much else. This is Michael Bay's best film, but that's not saying much since I hated his other films.3/10",3,3,8,15 September 2010
Clash of the Titans," No Effort At All Had Been Put Into It
","A severe disappointment. To be honest, I could only expect this one to be a movie with 'great visuals, but weak story,' but I was unprepared for just how bad this movie was.My first huge complaint with this movie is with Sam Worthington and the character he plays. Worthington seems to be making a point to play overly bland characters. In Avatar, he played a character who's part could have been covered by anyone--literally anyone, with the movie's CGI his role could have been filled by an ape--and Worthington didn't bring anything to the table. In Clash of the Titans, he brings less than nothing to the table. His performance is so wooden and his character is so bland, that I was more interested in Medusa, who has no lines and is only in fifteen minutes of the movie, than his character, Perseus. I couldn't get over how bland his character was; I just kept thinking to myself 'Wow. I didn't realize Perseus was so boring.' But Worthington wasn't the only bland character in this movie. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Star Wars I, Batman Begins) and Ralph Fiennes (Schindler's List, Harry Potter 4 & 5, Red Dragon) I can usually trust to give great performances and were the main reasons I decided to give this picture a chance. To my great astonishment, not only do both actors portray boring characters, but both actors are just so bad. Liam Neeson keeps putting weird inflections into everything he says and Ralph Fiennes plays half of the movie with this annoying hoarse voice and sounding like he wants to get up a fur ball.And then there's the movie's dialogue. Again, I wasn't looking for anything particularly phenomenal; just competence. The dialogue was so stilted and so bad that I was hoping that the last hour of the movie would be played in silence. It wasn't the worse dialogue I've ever heard; if it had that probably would have been fun to listen to. The dialogue was just so mediocre--as though no effort at all had been put into it--that it really gave me pain to listen to it.Usually in these kinds of films, they can make up for a lot of their short comings with good action. Not in Clash of the Titans. The action scenes are thrown haphazardly together and sometimes you can't even tell what's going on because the director made the awful choice of using shaky-cam while filming the intense action sequences. I felt like I was watching Cloverfield again, but in Cloverfield you were supposed to not know exactly what was going on, but you did get enough information to know. Here, you get nothing. At one point, Perseus jumps out of a giant scorpion's back. I guess I missed how he got in there in the first place because that part utterly confused me. The one scene in the movie that I really did like was the fight with Medusa. Not only was the director actually able to balance the action scenes right, but the character of Medusa was really fun to watch. Other than that, there really wasn't anything else in the movie that grasped my attention that well. A lot of the scenes were directed poorly and some of them served absolutely no purpose. And some characters are treated the same way. There are two characters who--I think--were meant to be our comedy relief. But they get hardly any screen time, leave halfway through the movie, and make one 4 second appearance toward the end of the film, but aren't mentioned after that. They did seem like some vaguely interesting characters, claiming they knew exactly how to kill such creatures as centaurs. I would have liked to get to know more about them, but they're hardly given any time on screen after that.Clash of the Titans was an interesting experience with some pretty cool visuals, but the direction, acting, screenplay, and characters were so badly conceived that the film ends up leaving no impression of any kind on the audience, except, perhaps, that this was a complete waste of time.3/10",3,3,5,15 September 2010
National Treasure," Nicholas Cage Seems Bored
","National Treasure is a lot of things. Fun entertainment is not one of them.Nicholas Cage and I have a peculiar relationship. I have seen him do great work (Kick-Ass, Adaptation) and I have seen him in less than admirable roles (this movie, its sequel). He doesn't really give a *bad* performance, but he doesn't really put in a lot of effort. He rolls over the historical information sounding like a guy who's trying to sound smart but has no idea what he's talking about. And for much of the movie, he acts lazily and with low energy. His friend in this movie, played by Justin Bartha, had a far more interesting personality. He was funny and entertaining. He was easily the most charming and fun to watch actor on the screen. That almost seems like a sad commentary when one considers the other actors he's sharing the screen with, like Jon Voight, Christopher Plummer, and Harvey Keitel.Basically, National Treasure is stupid, a poor man's Indiana Jones. The difference is that it has none of the intense action, excitement, or intelligence of an Indiana Jones movie. It has its moments, and at times is pretty fun to find out the mysteries with the lead characters. But at nearly every turn, I am going 'Oh, come on! Are we really expected to believe that our forefathers were busy with all these intricate hiding plans instead of fighting the revolution??' Yeah, that part doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, does it? The forefathers had this *huge* treasure at their disposal and they hid it for over three hundred years instead of passing it along later?The villains are generic and uninteresting, the love interest is just token, and Nicholas Cage seems bored through most of the movie. The only two actors who put forth any effort are Jon Voight and Justin Bartha. They at least acted like they were trying and that they cared. I didn't get that from anyone else. And the action scenes in this movie were borderline pathetic. What passes off as action in this movie comes off lazy, incompetent running around and chasing.What made this movie worth watching once was the screenplay. Was it great? No. Was it interesting? Fairly. It did have some creativity put into it, but it would be ridiculous if it didn't. It was written by three people, which doesn't really show in the final product. But the screenplay was at least competent. Final verdict: this is not a movie I recommend. It can be fun at times, but most of the time it's just rather silly.5/10",5,0,1,13 September 2010
Titanic," Titanic--Disaster of Dreams
","There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the 'My Heart Will Go On' song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended.In a nut shell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.",8,44,83,29 May 2007
Defiance," Edward Zwick Is Not A Skilled Director
","There is little to nothing that distinguishes Defiance from every other WWII and Holocaust film I have ever seen. Less than that, in fact. It rips off greater films and offers nothing new to the table.But the performances in Defiance were worthy of attention. Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber play a pair of brothers who have decided to not be part of the body count left in the wake of the Nazis' decimation. Their performances are strong and come from a pair of actors who have given a lot into their roles. And I would say that most of the actors in this film follow that, in spite of the little characterization given out of the screenplay written by Clayton Frohman and Edward Zwick. I refuse to believe that the story from which they based their screenplay had such poor character development. I wanted to know something about the characters who were fighting for their lives, but we got very little of that. And what we did get was unsatisfactory. This was a film that was far more interested in giving the 'uplifting message' rather than giving audiences a decent story.And nothing shows that more than the extremely obvious similarities between this film and Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, two vastly superior films. There is even a moment during one of the battle scenes in which the commanding character has a bomb go off by his head and the film starts going in slow motion. That scene is almost a shot-by-shot rip off of Saving Private Ryan.The one part of the film that truly impressed me was the music. I loved the soundtrack of this film. The music was easily the best part of the movie, and I wish the rest had matched that. But it didn't. Director Edward Zwick is not a skilled director. When he is not stealing material from Steven Spielberg's films, he is taking inspirational speech scenes directly from Braveheart, even putting in the extra effort in allowing the commander to ride a horse during the speech, even though I'm pretty sure the character does not ride the horse for the rest of the picture.Does Defiance have anything to offer audiences? Not in the slightest. Are there qualities of this movie worthy of attention? Not really. Does this movie do anything to truly make itself its own film with its own story? Unsatisfactorily, no.3/10",3,8,14,15 September 2010
X2: X-Men United," Great Fun And Highly Intelligent
","What made X-Men great was its intense action, fantastic characters, and wonderfully intelligent screenplay. What makes X2: X-Men United great is some intense action, fantastic characters, and wonderfully intelligent screenplay.X2 gives audiences a lot of new ideas that the first movie offered, with some added bonuses as well. The characters are even deeper here, and the film isn't quite as Wolverine heavy (even though I didn't think he was overly done in the first film either). But this film also takes its time with its characters a little bit more, which is what is so endearing about both of these movies.There is a surprising amount of tension in this film, especially concerning Xavier's cerebro, which I didn't expect. The tension builds beautifully during the action sequences (and these sequences did not disappoint).I also loved what they did with the villains here. Magneto, the main villain of the previous film, switches sides in X2 a couple of times, since he cares more for the rise of mutants than he does the well-being of average humans. But X2 introduces a new villain in a Lex Luthor type role. He's an average human with no special powers, but who pulls a lot of strings to get what he wants. In fact, I felt like this film played out more like Luthor than Luthor did in the Superman films.Every one of the X-Men has a big role in this film. Every one of them was played out very well and written in with a firm hold onto the story. Each one of them has his or her own story that is told fully and completely and that the audience can follow exceedingly well.In short, I liked X2. I'm not sure if I liked it more than the first film, but both of these movies do a lot with characters that I think a lot of superhero films (and action films in general) can learn from. Great fun and highly intelligent, X2 is an excellent film.9/10",8,0,1,14 September 2010
A Nightmare on Elm Street," I Commend Craven
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is certainly one of the better slasher films out there. It's demonic, gripping, gory, horrifying, gruesome, intelligent, and a really good time.The villain, Freddy Krueger, is one of the greatest villains of all time. He's scary in and of himself. His look is very distinct and his voice alone inspires quite a gripping bit of fear out of the audience. Robert Englund's performance is spotless.The movie is shaped around a great premise already, and Wes Craven builds the movie very firmly on it, putting it up there with Texas Chain Saw Massacre as being one of the best slasher films. The characters were all very well written and well portrayed. We actually get an emotional bond with some of these characters, and I commend Craven for that.And the music! The music is just behind the themes from Halloween and Jaws as one of my favorite horror film soundtracks. I loved the music entirely.The only major complaint I have with this film was the ending. While Craven took the direction with the Final Girl in a refreshingly original way, the ending itself was neither poignant nor satisfying. That's really the films only major weakness. Other than that, this is sincerely one of the greatest horror films ever made.8/10",8,0,0,12 September 2010
Fantastic Four," Just Lame
","Okay, after the Spider-Man movies, I was intrigued by this latest superhero flick. I knew it would probably be cheesy because the show and comics were kind of lame, but so were the Spider-Man shows and comics. However, I was astonished as to how stupid this movie was. Who was the genius that thought Alba would make a good addition to this film? She's terrible. She's awful. She's there solely for the scene when she takes off her clothes.The effects were... half way decent. Almost. The screenplay is crap. And I do mean crap. And the only person who is the least bit interesting to watch in this film is The Thing. So, 25% of the actors in this movie make any effort. I think that pretty much sums it up.As if the movie couldn't give me enough to gripe about, the villain was just lame. I mean, he wasn't scary or bad a** or anything. He was just... kind of mean and ticked off. The story is full of plot holes that I could go into detail about, but that would take up way too much time...All in all, nothing about this movie reaches the 'decent-movie' mark. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Wasn't this suppose to be the *Fantastic* Four?2/10",2,1,3,13 September 2010
Click," Egregiously Unfunny
","If there's one thing about movies that I cannot stand, it's when a movie rips off other ideas, movies, or stories. If there's another thing about movies I cannot stand, it's Adam Sandler. This movie is what I like to call a 'Double Whammy.' Now, to be fair, I feel like Adam Sandler himself was not as bad here as I have seen him in the past. Is he good? Well, I can't go that far. But, he does put in an inkling of effort, which really shows in the last few scenes of the movie. Throughout the rest of the movie, though, he is egregiously unfunny. He tries at the jokes, but he fails, miserably. This movie is basically the plot of It's a Wonderful Life, mixed with a little Christmas Carol, and topped off with a little Back to the Future for good luck. It insults me that so much unoriginality could go into what starts off as a halfway decent premise. Not a great premise, but halfway decent. It's a fairly good idea—a remote that can control every part of your life, like brightness or languages. Except, wouldn't it have been nice for someone to turn this baby into a universal translator instead of playing to Adam Sandler's needs? Other than that, the characters aren't all that interesting. We've seen all of these characters before, and even most of these lines before. The only part of this film that was any good was at the very end. I won't give it away, but it wasn't played out all that badly. As for the rest of the film... Well, simply put, there's a reason why George Bailey was such a nice guy in It's a Wonderful Life; it's kind of hard to feel sorry for a douche bag.3/10",3,9,21,14 September 2010
Pocahontas," It's Stupid
","Pocahontas is very possibly Disney's worst creation. This movie has two (count them: two) redeeming qualities. 1: The music is pretty cool. Not astounding, not amazing (it doesn't even come close to The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or even freaking Aladdin), but pretty cool. 2: The animation is nice to watch. Again, not astounding, not amazing (nowhere near as cool as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or freaking Aladdin), but it is a high point of the film. Other than that, it blows.The biggest problem with the movie is that it pretty much takes US history and Native American history and rapes it. Pocahontas, instead of being like 13, is a full 18. Why? So she can have a love affair (something too often milked by Disney) with John Smith, whom is basically worshipped in this movie. Granted, I don't think historical accuracy should make or break a film, but here, it's WAY off. It's like if a movie depicted George Washington with superhuman strength. We kill Native Americans for gold, Pocahontas and John Smith communicate through freaking *magic*, and coastal Virginia is abundant in cliffs. Cliffs!And it's also saying something if I didn't even find this movie very entertaining when I was younger. Not because of the historical inaccuracies, but because it's just stupid. The characters are bland as sh*t, all of the parts concerning magic are nonsensical, and the storyline is wholly undeserving of its 'epic' depiction. I put the word 'epic' in quotes because even though they did try to make it look epic, at the end of the day, it just didn't happen.So, Pocahontas's biggest problem is that it's stupid. I feel like the filmmakers never bothered to read any history or anything about this subject. At all. And the characters are dull, the voice actors aren't really all that interesting, and the dialogue is pretty much worthless. Not Disney's best endeavor. Very possibly Disney's worst.3/10",3,3,12,15 September 2010
The Proposal," Nothing Special At All
","In my review of The Break-Up, I expressed my frustration at modern romantic comedies. This one is that exactly. I mean, this movie feels like the stereotypical romantic comedy. More formulaic than just about any film that I've ever seen.After awhile, I started getting the same feeling that I did when I saw Prom Night: I was calling out what was going to happen next thirty minutes before it happened. It got quite annoying. There's a scene for an obvious setup for a gag in which Bullock and Reynolds end up in the same room without seeing each other and both get naked to take a shower. It's such an obvious setup for 'hilarious misunderstanding' that I wanted to turn off the film. And the film is *so* predictable. They force themselves with each other but then *gasp!* they start falling for each other. I mean, *who* could have seen *that* coming?!As for the performances, they were nothing special at all. I thought Reynolds did okay, but his character was entirely uninteresting to me. As for Bullock, she was bad. She wasn't Kristen-Stewart-bad, but she was still worse than I've ever seen her before. She just seems so lazy with it, as if she didn't really care about the picture. Sandra Bullock played an executive type character who will be kicked back to Canada from whence she came, so she must marry to stay in the country and with her job.But here was a *huge* problem I had with the movie: why did that guy *care* if they were really in love or not? A marriage is a marriage, dude, so calm down. It's not like they were forging the marriage, so what is going to matter if she just does it to stay in the USA? I did not like The Proposal much at all. Of course, I liked Betty White, but that's because she was Betty White. And even she was subjected to some really lame setups.The Proposal wasn't total crap, but it's devotion to formula is what made me so frustrated by it. It might have had some potential if the filmmakers had bothered to do anything new with the film, but they didn't bother. No effort put into story, so no effort by me to be entertained.3/10",3,3,4,15 September 2010
Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park Art
","Jurassic Park is, without a doubt, number 2 in the most important innovative movies (next to probably Star Wars) seeing as it completely altered the way films are made. I give this film a nine out of ten for its remarkable CGI dinosaurs (better than some CGI characters out still today), its incredible acting, and clever writing.Let's face it, the story was already a good one, and when Chrichton wrote the screenplay for this film, he completely added to the story and made it even better.Acting was very good, especially by Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum. Their performances are definitely incomparable to any others in the series. (Jeff's acting heightened some for The Lost World) The music score by John Williams is one of his best without a doubt. Editing was absolutely perfect.I really cannot think of a single complaint for this film. I will say that the kids Lex and Tim got a little annoying throughout, but they were a good experience for Sam's character to grow on.Steven Spielberg proves himself here, as with all his movies, as being one of the all-time greatest directors. This movie was simply art in itself.",10,3,6,30 May 2007
