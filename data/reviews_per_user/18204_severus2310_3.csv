Iron Man 3," Not too bad, but a big disappointment
","The first 2 Iron mans were great and his performance in the avengers blew many away and so many were excited about the new movie to come out but sadly, it was not worth the wait. This movie described the character of some good but were not consistent and many were poor and unclear. The plot was boring and predictable, although it did have a few unexpected twists in it, the twists were not clever and failed to impress me. The plan of th villain was passionate, but that was all that was shown of the villain and the villain was very disappointing and failed to be made as a match for the hero. Also many parts in the story are ridiculous and actions of Tony Stark don't make any sense. The character development of Tony Stark was good when he was forced to overcome several obstacles, but the movie focused too much on the one character and very little attention was given to the rest of the characters. So in conclusion the movie was a disappointment and had a boring plot but had good although limited character development, but is a nice movie to watch if you are looking for some action scenes with stunts and special effects.INNER MOTIVATION=7 OUTER MOTIVATION=5 FINAL RATING= 6 out of 10",8,1,4,22 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," A great movie which kept the main traditional Star Trek legacy and made necessary and great improvements
","This is the second edition to the Star Trek franchise created by JJ Abrams. The first movie by JJ Abrams was very good and this was even better. There were the same familiar actors as before and this time new characters some from 'the wrath of Khan' and they were played perfectly and there was really good casting. The characters all changed and showed their own strong personalities and sense of identity throughout the movie and many emotional connections between the crew and other characters were shown. The story was not as complex as the first movie and it wasn't completely necessary to watch the first movie but it would help for understanding. The story was brilliant and had many twists and at many times it was uncertain what was going to happen and who was the villain, it was very clever but at some times may have been a little bit fast which wasn't a negative point but may not be preferred by some people whom prefer a slower movie and it does therefore need attention to understand. The background music was very important for the effects of several emotional scenes which both created a sense of awe and a sense of familiarity and emotion and so did the use of keeping the traditional and most favourite things of the original movies. The movie moved through smoothly and was non- stop action and suspense, but still had a few spaces with some character and humor to catch your breath. The animations and special effects of the movie was greatly used and was the most important tool in modernizing the old start trek effects.",10,2,10,19 July 2013
Lincoln," A movie to show that the content of the movie is still more important than the action
","Daniel Day-Lewis stole the movie. It was personally the best acting I have ever seen. There was no action scenes in this movie which is unlikely for a movie made by Steven Spielberg, but this film proved that he is not only good with explosions. The costumes and props of Lincoln set the time periods and scenarios very well and makes the viewer fell the appropriate atmosphere and the cinematography also manipulated the emotion of the audience as well as the excellent background music by John Williams. Steven Spielberg chose to tell the story in the perfect way, through both the eyes of both political sides and the time period was very well researched especially the way that people at the time thought and that added to the emotion created through the acting. The movie went through smoothly and there were almost no parts that seemed too short or too long. The movie Lincoln although it may not be for those who are looking for an action movie but if they would really take the time and understanding to see a movie with good content and acting or is interested in a drama or a political movie then this is a good movie for you",9,3,5,24 April 2013
