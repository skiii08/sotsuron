Ford v Ferrari," Great entertainment even if you're not a Rev Head
","My Review - Ford V Ferrari
Mr rating. 8.5 /10I don't have the slightest interest in car racing or cars but this story and its characters held my interest for 152 minutes and that in my opinion is the test of good directing by James Mangold ( Walk the Line ,Wolverine Logan) and a great ensemble cast of actors.Ford V Ferrari is based on a true story like nearly every movie these days and centres around the two main characters Matt Damon as Carroll Shelby and Christian Bale as racing car driver Ken MilesThe bones of the story you can view in the trailer but the flesh and blood is in the great script by Jason Keller and brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth who were named recipients of the Writers Guild of America West's 2011 Paul Selvin Award for their screenplay for the film Fair Game (2010), directed by Doug Liman and starring Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.The story is basically described in IMBD as American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.For me it was the characters that got me in not the great action car racing scenes
Matt Damon as usual gives a great performance but it's Christian Bale that steals the film he's a great dad and husband and very funny at times but doesn't suffer fools graciously and has attitude plus to anyone who tries to come between him and his passion of racing. I wouldn't be at all surprised if Christian Bale is nominated for an Oscar next year for this role of course he'll lose it to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker.Matt Damon is his friend and champion when the self interested Ford Corporate bosses try to edge Ken Miles out as their driver as in their eyes he's not a 'Ford Man.'
Henry Ford 11 played so well by Tracy Letts is a pig and runs his Ford Empire with fear that includes one scene in which he shuts of the machines and threatens his workers . Josh Lucas as Leo Beebe Fords Director of Special vehicles and the executive nemesis of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles is also great in this perfectly balance ensemble cast of actors .Ken Miles wife Mollie played by Catriona Balfe gets a special mention as does Noah Jupe as Miles son Peter they are both so convincing and it reinforces my empathy with families of racing car drivers and all daredevil pursuits that they can never be sure if their loved one will come home after a race.I thoroughly recommend seeing Ford V Ferrari it's one of the best movies of the year.",9,2,3,19 November 2019
Hereditary," This is not the 21ST Century 'The Exorcist' !
","Wasn't going to give my review of this movie because a friend recommended it and obviously had a different view of it than I but isn't that what being critical is all about so all I'll say is Toni Collette is a terrific actress and I look forward to her next movie.
I loved the Sixth Sense in which Toni also played a mother of a very disturbed child but that was a great script and truly scary and disturbing.
I'd like to ask Toni Collette the same question I'd have asked Helen Mirren, about her role in the movie Winchester , why did they appear in these movies, and what did they think when they watched the final cut?
The family in this movie makes The Addams Family look normal .The children especially Alex Wolff, who plays Peter gives a good performance but doesn't look as though he belongs ethnically or emotionally to the family. The daughter played by Milly Shapiro looks odd and unattractive from the beginning, perhaps that's intentional but her character doesn't have time to develop.
I like a good scary movie but after over 2 hours I could only think at the end that the script writer and production team couldn't work out a credible ending. If they had of just ended the movie 20 minutes before rather than add a selection of unattractive spooks and paranormal paraphernalia, which was more humorous than spooky I'd have thought more about Hereditary.",4,2,6,31 August 2018
Rocketman," Nearly snuffed out like A Candle In The Wind- This Phoenix Rose Again
","Rocketman- My Review 9/10This movie is a celebration of a talented life saved from the brink of death due to addiction.It's a joyful romp tinged with drama and sadness and much more like a musical which and I predict it will eventually become a Stage musical.The musical numbers and fantasy are choreographed beautifully and it's no coincidence that Sir Elton John as Executive Producer and creator of the musical Billy Elliott has assembled a superb cast including the original star of the 2000 film of Billy Elliott Jamie Bell who is outstanding as Elton's music partner Bernie Taupin.Taren Edgerton, is superb as Elton John and unlike Rami Malek in Bohemian Rhapsody sings all Elton's great hits himself.Director Dexter Fletcher knows how to make a biography interesting and entertaining without seeming like a documentary.Dexter Fletcher was bought into finish the troubled Bohemian Rhapsody in 2018 after Bryan Singer was fired.
Rocketman is a very different style to Bohemian Rhapsody which had a more documentary feel at times .The movie ðŸŽ¥ definitely reminded me of two musicals The Boy from Oz and Billy Elliott,especially the childhood scenes and Matthew Illesley as young Elton is very impressive as is Gemma Jones as Ivy ,Elton's grandmother ,who I'm sure the Grandmother in Billy Elliott is based on ,she has 'baggage.'
The entire cast are impressive,especially Richard Madden who plays Elton's manager / opportunist lover in the dark days of Elton's decline from Addiction.Lee Hall the scriptwriter, who's previous film scripts include Billy Elliott, Victoria and Abdul and War Horse has managed to portray the great emotion and sadness of Elton's life then contrasts this with the exhilarating climb to stardom in Elton's early career which later turns to betrayal,despair and loneliness when his life is nearly snuffed out by addiction 'Like a Candle in the Wind.We know the ending because Elton John is still very much alive and preparing for his retirement world tour .
He has a happy marriage to partner David Furnish and two children Zachary and Elijah.Nothing like a happy ending ,especially when his mother says in the movie after Elton tells her he is gay that she doesn't care but he'll spend his life never being loved and lonely.",9,2,7,25 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Great performances but nothing new to add -
","I wish this had been the same stars Bradley Cooper and Lady GaGa in a different movie because they both are incredibly talented and are great together and yes the chemistry is there but this fourth remake (two to many) of a Star Is Born as far as I'm concerned has nothing more to add to the story of successful star meets and falls for struggling singer who's career eventually eclipses his and his addiction extinguishers his star forever.
I don't usually give spoilers but this scenario has been done before and better. Saying that ,if this is your first Star is Born you'll love it I'm sure.
I didn't like Streisand's and Kristofferson's version much either in 1976 and I'm still of the opinion that Judy Garland's 1954 A Star is Born is the best .
I can understand why new generations of movie stars are attracted to the story and want to put their own stamp on it but it's not Shakespeare and it has become a little cliched to say the least when you know the entire plot in advance and nothing new except new faces foul language and pop music are added to the same story written in 1936.
I noticed Barbra Streisand's one time boyfriend and producer of her version of this story , the very controversial Jon Peters ( they call him the Trump of Hollywood) is a producer of this latest version and remember some critics cruelly said his and Streisand's version should have been retitled A Star is Still Born .
In my humble opinion this 2018 version is as good as the 1976 version and it didn't come alive for me either and Streisand is one of my favourite stars.
Some good songs lifted it for me , especially Lady Ga Ga who is a true superstar and wrote some of her songs ( so did Streisand and won an Academy Award for Evergreen )
Ga Ga has a great voice range , like Barbra Streisand and they admire each other's talent.
Lady Ga Ga's little tribute to Judy Garland early in the film singing the introduction to Somewhere Over the Rainbow,which Judy never sang herself wasn't lost on me .
Bradley Cooper has a very good voice plus gives a great performance but I just wish that I had seen them in a new original story , I'd love to see Ga Ga in a film with a terrific new script telling the amazing story of Amy Winehouse , almost a reverse role for her to this film. Amy Winehouse was another incredible talent lost to the world in her prime due to addiction.
A Star is Born 2018 is getting great reviews and has Oscar nomination written all over it but I wouldn't like to see Lady Ga Ga win when Judy Garland didn't and truly delivered the ultimate portrayal of this character in her version.",7,2,4,23 October 2018
Darkest Hour," A
","I think we saw this years Best Actor academy award performance today. Garry Oldman is superb..
I wasn't keen to see this movie as I'm not a Winston Churchill admirer and certainly not a Hitler fan and we've seen endless movies about that mad monster.So went with a hope that we'd see a realistic portrayal of Churchill the man , who was as history shows the right man for the right time to lead Britain to victory in World War 2.
What Garry Oldman delivers is a superb characterisation not an imitation of a very flawed but very determined individual, the screenwriter has not shied away from Churchill's faults , his alcohol dependence or his past disasters like the Gallipoli slaughter or his massive ego and yet Oldman delivers under all that superb prosthetic makeup and padding to show Churchill's humour and insecurity and a vital characteristic lacking in today's politicians integrity and service.Regardless what you think of Churchill he ignored his detractors and enemies most on his own cabinet and followed his own instinct and opinions unlike our current Prime Minister and was not interested in popularity to boost his already healthy ego.Australian Ben Mendelsohn gives an equally good performance as King George the Sixth and Kristin Scott Thomas delivers a great supporting role as Clementine Churchill.
Great start to Oscar lead up a must see film.",8,0,3,11 January 2018
Amistad," A neglected gem and prequel to Lincoln.
","My Review Amistad- Rating 8/10I missed this gem of a movie in the cinema release but obviously not the only one as it barely made half its $36 million USD production cost World Wide but I'm so glad I've added it to my DVD collection and can appreciate it years later.In I997 Steven Spielberg Directed and Co Produced Armistad his first production for Fox Searchlight Films.Based on a true story concerning a group of 53 African slaves who revolt and capture their ship The Amistad and
are tricked by their captors who sail them to America where slavery was still legal in 1853 rather than Africa their homeland.
They are all put on trial to fight for their freedom and lives while slave traders in Cuba and the young Queen Isabella of Spain in the unusual cast choice of New Zealander Anna Paquin claim that they own this human cargo of misery.
Be warned there is violence and cruelty depicted in this film but it's necessary to portray the hideous treatment that their unscrupulous greedy captors inflicted on them.There's some fine performances in this movie ,especially Anthony Hopkins as the frail old but razor sharp former American President John Quincy Adams ,who reluctantly eventually takes on the slaves final legal bid for freedom to The Supreme Court of The United States.
Also great acting from Djimon Hounsou as Cinque the slave leader and Chiwetel Ejiofor in his first movie role as Ensign Covey the African entrepreneur,remember his later well deserved Oscar Nominated role in 12 Years A Slave?
I was also impressed with Matthew McConaughey as Roger Sherman Baldwin the young lawyer who proves to be much more than the inexperienced over confident rookie he first appears to be and is so instrumental in the final outcome.Steven Spielberg is a fine Director who has won 3 Academy Awards and nominated Seven times and I think this much overlooked movie is one of his finest films and almost a Prequel to Lincoln filmed in 2012 and much more applauded than the overlooked but equally compelling Amistad .",8,1,3,6 July 2019
Knives Out," Entertaining quirky a bit too clever
","My Review -Knives Out
My Rating 7:10I'm a little either side of appreciating this film it's very entertaining and well acted with a great cast including Daniel Craig who is very good as the Colonel Sanders Hercule Poirot also Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale the matriarch of a dysfunctional family of self centred opportunistic characters .They are joined by Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer,Chris Evans and Anna De Armas as the Carer to the elderly rich author Harlem Thromby.No spoilers here I'm still thinking about the outcome and a little confused but my fellow movie viewing partner says it's more a retro crime comedy so perhaps I'm looking for logic where I shouldn't be.The Director also wrote the screenplay Rian Johnson who also wrote and directed the 3 episodes of the Breaking Bad series and Star Wars V111 The Last Jedi .
So tons of talented people involved in this entertaining film but to me it was a little like watching a film of a good stage play at times and I thought trying to be a little too clever for its own good",7,9,24,28 November 2019
The Irishman," Too long it's a Television Drama nota movie
","My Review- The Irishman
It's very difficult to review a movie when it's been removed from Cinema release and goes straight to Netflix streaming.The very limited Cinema release is purely so Netflix can qualify the movie for Oscar consideration and effectively denies the movie going public from seeing it until its released on televisionThis movie to my mind is far too long for any movie it's over 3 and a half hours and probably would make a great mini series but as a movie I got tired of the repetitive foul language and violence same old same old hit man crime and violence.While I admired the performances of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino I've seen this plot scenario many times before . The Power play by gangs and gang bosses resulting in corruption and violence .This one is the reminiscences of an old man Robert DeNiro retelling his 'glory' days as a Teamster hitman assassin and his association with the notorious gangster Jimmy Hoffa told from his wheel chair in an aged care home.
We get introduced to these criminals and gangsters with captions on their ultimate fate either prison or gunned down and murdered.Trouble is Al Pacino is now 79 and the flash backs to his teamster days as much as makeup can give the illusion of youth Al still looks too old to play a man probably in his early 50'sWe meet many tough and savage teamsters and the slow pace of this film just made me lose interest , perhaps it may seem more dramatic on a huge screen but Netflix have made sure we only get s limited cinema release.As much as I'm an admirer of Martin Scorsese films and Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino this is certainly no Godfather Part 2If this is the future of Cinema Im not happy
If it's a film worth seeing Netflix should slow a normal release time there is a huge difference in a Television Show be it the best quality production but 3.5 hours is a mini series in my opinion.There's lots of Oscar talk about The Irishman but like Roma last year I don't think it should be considered as it's a Netflix TV drama ðŸŽ­",7,3,6,17 December 2019
Ready Player One," Spielberg at his Best-
","Spielberg at his best;
I really enjoyed this escape from reality and the homage to so many movies and cultural icons Steven Spielberg has managed to cram into this game within a game movie.
A few weeks ago I reviewed another virtual reality movie a (rom com) Game Night , which I really loathed and thought absolute crap so I was a little sceptical about Ready Player One.
Last Sunday we visited our neighbours very switched on and clever Grandson Callum for his 9th birthday celebration and he was engrossed in his new video game with head set in place and I could see it had captured his imagination and I spotted his Avatar or virtual reality identity in full destroyer battle mode.
I wish now I'd taken up his invitation to join in the game as I've never played a video game but there's always next time.
This experience unknowingly prepared me for this movie in which has cleverly combined real actors , who live in a bleak futuristic 2045 in dismal residential towers called 'The Stacks'.
The occupants of this dark and shattered world escape to the Oasis a virtual realty world where fantasy is the aim and adventure is the game.
Some have said this may be Spielberg 's greatest movie I'm not sure about that sweeping statement but it's up there with ET and Close Encounters.
A terrific youthful cast headed by Tye Sheridan as Parzival, our hero and Olivia Cooke as his capable side kick and romantic interest are the young game players but I was also impressed by the villain Australia 's Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento and Mark Rylance as Anorak and the inventor of the Oasis James Halliday.
Also loved the music and the fact that what could seem a bleak future Spielberg has transformed into a spectacular colourful world where the human element is most the important component.
It's more about friendship , loyalty and caring for your fellow humans and reality really wins out in the end.
A High Five ! and I'll add 4 to score this movie a 9.",8,0,1,31 August 2018
"I, Tonya"," Red Neck U.S.A. Heaven
","Extraordinary story- no spoilers it would ruin the movie but I wouldn't be at all surprised if Australian actress Margot Robbie who gives a superb performance as Tonia Harding and Alison Janney as her mother ( she makes Medea look warm and fuzzy) take out a double actress Oscar victory.
With the current mood in Hollywood and their excellent performances both women excel.I knew noting really about Tonia's story and though I'd enjoy the ice skating but this film is much more than it appears. I liked it's almost documentary style exposing red neck American 'culture 'and domestic and criminal violence both male and female perpetrated by husband and mother .A must see movie but don't expect The Nutcracker or Sleeping Beauty on ice.",8,2,3,25 January 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Do we ever learn from the hateful events in History?
","Watched an interesting interview with Spike Lee the director of this movie and it increased my interest to see BlacKKKlansman 100%
Spike Lee's hope is that young Americans will vote on mass in the mid term elections to send a massage to 'Agent Orange' his reference to Donald Trump and the Republicans when they see this movie.
This disturbing and at times frightening movie is an adaptation of true events in Colorado in the late 1970's when Ron Stallworth an African American infiltrated the ranks of the Klu Klux Klan.
It's hard to watch at times not because of the violence or events but because of the realisation that these racist humans and the hateful offensive language they spew out are alive and well and living in America and worse, in pockets of Australia today.
This was emphasised by actual footage used in the movie of The White Nationalists riots in Charlottesville 2017 , when 3 people were killed and Trump defended them by saying ' Some Very Fine People on Both Sides.
This movie is important, well acted and directed and does what good movies are supposed to do entertain but also educate and inform.
John David Washington, son of Denzel is impressive as Ron Stallworth as is Adam Driver as Flip Zimmerman the white decoy cop who is the means for Stallworth to trick the Klan Master.
I especially liked Ashlie Atkinson in the difficult role of the ignorant stupid wife married to a hateful monster
and following his every edict to inflict terror on the innocent in the name of so called 'Christian Ayrian Supremacy.'
Harry Belafonte the famous Calypso singer , actor and Civil Rights champion now 91 gives an incredibly moving performance as Jerome Turner retelling the atrocious murder by whites of a young black man in the early 20th Century to an assembly of black students.
It wasn't just the hate and racial slurs of coloured people that disturbed me ,all minority groups including Jews , faggots and anyone that differed in appearance, religious belief or ideology was included in this story that is as relevant today, especially today as it was in the 1970's

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," STUNNING! asks so many questions about human behaviour.
","Three Billboards is a stunner in more ways than one, stunning screenplay, stunning performances and stunning direction!
It's a thought provoking very confronting story at times and takes you on a journey where you don't know what's going to happen plot wise next.
Francis Mc Dormand and Sam Rockwell give career defining performance and both deserve their Academy award nominations as do Martin Mc Donagh the director, every second of this movie is used beautifully and shows what great directing and editing can add to a superb script.
No spoilers but this movie will provoke a lot of emotions and ask a lot questions about human behaviour without giving clear answers .",9,2,4,30 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Final episode and a fitting tribute to Carrie
","My Review : Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker
My Rating 8/10I've enjoyed The Star Wars franchise for 32 years since Episode 1 The Phantom Menace but wouldn't by any stretch call myself a Skywalker or what ever term is used for Star Wars groupies.
However the last one I saw Episode 8 The Last Jedi I didn't enjoy as much I found it confusing and very dark. Confusion I think is understandable considering Episode 8 was set 34 years after the first episode A New Hope. It's a little like the Chinese custom of reading a book from the back cover to the front.I really did enjoy this final instalment I thought it was exciting , perhaps I did absorb more of the Last of the Jedi than I thought because I wasn't as confused in this movie . I notice The Rise of Skywalker has a different Director JJ Abrams (Ryan Johnson directed The Last Jedi).
I thought this film got back to the Spirit of the earlier Star Wars I liked so much especially the joyous final scenes.Speaking of 'Spirits 'I can't think of any movie where a cast member Carrie Fisher, known for her portrayal of Princess Leia Organa in the Star Wars saga who passed away on December 27, 2016 appears so effectively and seamlessly in a film 3 years after her death.
I thought it a fitting final tribute to an iconic character and more importantly to Carrie Fisher herself the miraculous way technology allowed her final screen role and her character to at last Rest In Peace.
Though Fisher passed away prior to Episode 9 beginning filming, J.J.Abrams knew he needed to keep Leia in the final Skywalker movie's story. 'What are you going to do?' he said on stage at the Episode 9 Star Wars Celebration panel. 'You don't recast that part, and you don't have her suddenly disappear.'
J.J.Abrams realized that he had enough unused footage of Fisher from filming Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) that he could create a story around Leia and still have her play a significant role in the movie. From the way Abrams explained it, Leia's entire arc is built around the story he could form from her archival footage, which meant they didn't have to resort to any other storytelling tricks like CG recreations of Leia to fit her into the Episode 9 story.
Footage of Carrie Fisher from the prior two films was incorporated through the process of rotoscoping, or digitally removing the background of footage and superimposing it elsewhere. Visual effects were also used to change her wardrobe and add gray to her hair so the footage from the films would match.
I found this aspect of the film one of the most interesting especially that Carrie Fisher's daughter had given her blessing for this final tribute to her mother.
I also enjoyed Daisy Ridley as Rey and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren more I this film than the lastOne day when I have a reason to devote an entire day to spare I'll watch them all in order now that I have a correct viewing list .Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (set 32 years before A New Hope)
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (set 22 years before A New Hope)
Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (set 19 years before A New Hope)

Léon: The Professional," How could I have missed this movie!
","One of the best parts of sharing movie recommendations is when a friend introduces you to a movie you've missed at the Cinema.
Thanks Stephanie for recommending the1994 movie Leon The Professional.My review 9/10How did I miss this movie? It amazes me how many movies there's still left for me to see.
Natalie Portman was 13 years old when she made this movie.
It was her movie debut and what a debut it is. She plays Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is reluctantly taken in by LÃ©on, a professional assassin, after her family is murdered.
LÃ©on and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protÃ©gÃ©e and learns the assassin's trade.Yes of course there's guns and violence but this movie has a heart and the intelligence and beauty of Natalie Portman's performance is possibly the best adolescent acting portrayal I've ever seen on film .No wonder she's had the career she has had and
is the first person born in the 1980s to have won the Academy Award for Best Actress (for Black Swan (2010)).The 3 main male leafs in this movie are all excellent also , especially Jean Reno as Leon , his relationship with Mathilda is touching and sensitive and gives an award winning performance.
How can a professional assassin training a 12 year old girl in the same profession be touching I hear you ask ?, you'll have to see the Movie to find out.Garry Oldman such a fine Actor plays a mentally deranged menacing mob boss with demonic charm who hums Beethoven for thrills as he dispatches his enemies and competition and shows no pity be they man woman or child.Danny Aeillo as Tony , Leon's Italian friend and confidant is also excellent .Written and Directed by Luc Besson this is a movie not to be missed but be warned it is violent in parts but no more than any crime show or movie you'll see on television tonight.
The performances are all superb, especially Natalie Portman.",9,0,0,5 September 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great Nostalgia and Great performance -
","Ami Malek is sensational playing Freddie Mercury in this biopic . The singing is dubbed with a combination of Mercury's own voice and Canadian singer Marc Martel and the first scene they filmed was The famous 1985 Live Aid .Concert which opens and closes the movie.
What is between the opening and closing scenes is the story of an incredible talent matched with an incredible ego that isolated Freddie Mercury at times from those that truly cared for him and supported him.
If it's a true assessment of Mercury's true character and I've no reason to believe it's not he made some terrible judgments as far as his friends associates and his career were concerned but that's perhaps the price of his genius?
I read this was a very difficult film shoot with the director Bryan Singer being fired due to artistic differences with Rami Malek, thank goodness the original choice for the role Sacha Baron Cohen didn't get to play Freddie Mercury.
Rami Malek surely will get a nomination for Best Actor Oscar next year and probably will never get a role as good as this again . I must say the dentures to replicate Freddie Mercury's jaw line I felt were too extreme and took a bit of getting used to but I thought the same about Nicole Kidman's prosthetic nose in The Hours and she won an Oscar for that or some unkind people say she won by a nose.
Apparently as well as watching hours of Freddie Mercury's stage movements and choreography Rami Malek also was advised by his movement coach to study Liza Minnelli in Cabaret as well as Jimi Hendrix , David Bowie and Aretha Franklin all these performers inspired Freddie Mercury's performances and it certainly is evident in the movie.
I didn't come to really appreciate Queen and their brilliance till later in life long after Freddie Mercury had died of AIDS but his story to anyone who lived through that terrible plague and I'm one of them remembers the friends , loved ones and talented performers from all branches of the Arts who's lives were snuffed out prematurely.
I couldn't help thinking that if there had been a Live Aid concert for HIV AIDS similar to the World Famine concert in 1985 how many lives may have been spared ? Alas Ronald Reagan was President till 1989 and his Administration was not interested and apathetic in helping find a cure or even providing relief for AIDS patients until it realised the enormity of the plague and that it infected and involved the whole of humanity .",8,1,2,5 November 2018

Yesterday," Yesterday needed HELP! as it was a Long and Winding Road........
","My Review- Yesterday. I rate it 6.5A Long and Winding Road that took a few bad turns.I was really looking forward to go against some of the negative criticism Yesterday is receiving as I liked the original story concept portrayed in the trailers I saw but as often happens the trailer is better than the movie.Yesterday is an Adult fantasy,a little Faustian ( sell your soul to the devil ) and Sliding Doors ( What if I took the different road) also Aladdin grant me my greatest wish.
The trouble for me with this movie basically is the script,it just gets sillier and veers off in all directions until I started to lose interest.I blame the Director Danny Boyle the story writer Jack Barth and Screenplay writer Richard Curtis ,who wrote great stories and Screenplays for Four Weddings and a Funeral , Bridget Jones Diary and Love Actually but also the horrible recent one for Mama Mia! Here We Go Again,which I notice gets about the same rating on IMBD as Yesterday, which could have been much better.Yesterday I enjoyed much more than Mama Mia !Here We Go Again ,which also featured Lily James who plays Ellie Appleton in Yesterday .Himesh Patel ( no relation to Dev Patel) plays Jack Malek a song writer musician who has been trying for years to be appreciated for his talent .His manager Ellie ,who would like to be more than a friend and manager is the only one that has faith in Jack.
Then a 7 second total World black out erases any reference to The Beatles and their music.
Jack runs in to a car in the dark on his bike and wakes up in hospital and when it sinks in after searching the web that no one knows any of the Beatles music he decides this is his chance to become famous.No more spoilers (that's all in the trailers )because I can't rubbish this movie as it's original but flawed and the cast are all very good ,especially Himesh Patel who sings and plays his own guitar while performing the Beatles songs .Yesterday is worth seeing for the excellent cast and for Beatles music fans plus Ed Sheeran fans ,who plays himself very well and its entertaining and good fun in parts as The Beatles song goes 'It Was a Hard Days Night ' and the script needed 'Help'!",6,2,5,28 June 2019
Toy Story 4," Sequels can work when there's Great Talent and Creativity
","My Review Toy Story 4. Rating 8.5What better remedy for a miserable day than to take myself off to see possibly the last story in one of the most successful movie Franchises of all time.Toy Story is the 22nd highest-grossing franchise worldwide, the fourth highest-grossing animated franchise, and is among the most critically acclaimed franchises of all time.The talent and creativity that goes into Toy Story is phenomenal , since the first Toy Story
Release in 1995 the creators at Pixar have maintained the high standards of the first film and continued the theme of inclusiveness and community in the 3 sequels.Nowadays voice overs in animated features get full cast credits attract top names and are paid accordingly unlike the pioneer Disney features animated films like Snow White , Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty and Tom Hanks who has finally handed in Woody's Tin Star said that he was in tears while doing his final lines as his Toy Story character, Woody. The actor, who reprised his role for the last time in Toy Story 4, said ending their almost three-decade run together was a 'terrible' feeling.This Toy Story made me reflect on my favourite childhood toy Crow Shoot and I'm glad that on the occasional wet day I can suspend the reality of Adulthood and return to the innocent and uncomplicated days of my early childhood I highly recommend it to everyone, it's great to take your inner child out for the day.Can you remember your favourite childhood toy.",8,31,58,4 July 2019
The Favourite," Power House performances and great originality and wit
","We just came out from seeing this stunning movie to find lead actress Olivia Coleman has won the 2019 Golden Globe for best Actress in a Comedy or Musical and Glenn Close for her superb performance in The Wife in the Drama category..
Olivia Coleman gives a sensational portrayal of the ageing Queen Anne and yes this fine film has comedy in it as well as compelling dramatic moments thanks to the fine screenplay Tony McNamara and director Yorgos Lanthomos.
It reminded me of the 1988 Film Dangerous Liaisons but with the bawdiness of Tom Jones .
It's a tour de force for 3 fine actresses Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weiss and last years Golden Globe Best actress recipient Emma Stone.
The male actors are all fine but every scene is dominated expertly by these 3 fine actresses.
I'm not sure of the historical accuracy of Queen Anne or Sarah Churchill's relationship or of her influence over the Queen but who cares this is a fine screenplay and perfect example of when the Cast , The Director , and the Screenwriter are in perfect synch.
As a final comment thank goodness the Monarch has no constitutional power today who knows what devious characters lay in waiting to manipulate and trump them into irrational decisions like Brexit negotiations for instance.
Go see this fine example of great cinema and I can't wait to see Olivia's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth 2 in the next series of The Crown .Long Live Olivia.",9,3,6,17 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The Genius of Quentin Tarantino displayed in every word and frame.
","My Review- Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.My Rating 10/10I've been waiting for this film and wanted to see it first day of release so have avoided reading reviews or too much background to it as I wanted it to be a fresh experience.For that reason I'm not giving any spoilers regarding the plot other than what anyone can see in the trailers,don't let anyone spoil your enjoyment of this great and important film by spilling the story plot or fascinating climax.Actually my perception of this film is two movies in one about characters some fictional like Rick Dalton the cinema tv action movie star ,who's career is in a decline with yet another superb performance from Leonardo Di Caprio and his affable buddy stuntman Cliff Booth also superbly played by the ageless Brad Pitt, has he sold his soul to the devil! ,he's 55 years old for Gods sake.The main characters,real and fictional in this nostalgic ,humorous, dramatic love poem to the demise of 'The Golden Hollywood Years' don't really connect till the great climax ,of the film which some fans have criticised but I thought perfectly captured the fictional 'what if' style of Tarantino this film is truly only slightly based on real events but demands we know some facts about the real characters.
It's fantasy illusion ,isn't that what Hollywood and Cinema do best?It's set in the dying days of The Golden Years of Hollywood and the end of the 1960's when teenagers wore flowers in their hair and Hollywood Celebrity party's had a somewhat free love debauched pre AIDS Great Gatsby style .
The great soundtrack of these parties included Paul Revere and the Raiders,Four Tops and Deep Purple and the hit movies were Polanski's Rosemary's Baby ,Valley of the Dolls , Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet ,Funny Girl and Steve McQueen's Bullitt.The second movie in one that fits seamlessly into the fictional plot concerns actual characters primarily the ill fated actress Sharon Tate played beautifully by our own Margo Robbie ( Australian stars are shining all over Hollywood).
Margo is glamorous in this and perhaps isn't as stunningly beautiful as Sharon Tate but she captures the essence of her character humorous and fragile and wears the stunning late 1960's costumes by Arianne Phillips superbly ,all the costumes, the sets the cinematography add to the authenticity and attention to detail that a Quentin Tarantino movie demands.Quentin Tarantino ,winner of 2 screenwriting Academy Awards for Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained is one of the few true geniuses of Cinema making and this film has Academy Award nomination worthiness in every frame.As writer director and co-producer of this magnificent love poem to the end of the Golden Years of Hollywood and the beginning of Cinemas greatest threat Television,thank goodness both have thrived and survived but the only way to appreciate this film is on a Cinema screen.Please comment on your reactions whether you agree with me of not I'm fascinated in what you think of Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.I can't wait to see it again ,there's so much in this film.",10,23,38,15 August 2019
Get Out," Scary in a weird disturbing way
","Get Out is an unusual suspense horror thriller Daniel Kaluuya is very good in his role but must be the replacement for James Franco who was odds on favourite for a nomination until 'allegations 'of misconduct at the 11th hour by actresses he had worked with scared off The Academy voters.
It's quite a good movie I found the subject of Afro American slave zombies slightly uncomfortable and politically incorrect.
The movie came out May last year so I had to hire it and watch on the small screen and it perhaps would have seemed better at the cinema as all movies worth seeing are but I'm certain Get Out doesn't deserve or have a hope of winning Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director or Best Screenplay, all the categories of which it's been nominated for.
I have only one question after seeing this movie , why was the director of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri Martin McDonagh so egregiously snubbed for a best director nomination when Jordan Peele managed a nomination for Get Out, which is a good movie but just doesn't deserve any of its nominations in my humble opinion..",7,2,5,15 February 2018
Aladdin," Aladdin or The Will Smith Show?
","My Review- Aladdin I rate 6.5I really am a sucker for classic Disney films but I think this one like Beauty and the Beast and Dumbo to my mind miss the boat ,possibly because humanising animation classics or trying to bring them up to date adds nothing to the original.It's a good cast Mena Massoud as Aladdin is engaging as the rascally Aladdin ,Naomi Scott is charming and feisty as Princess Jasmine and has a lovely voice .
Will Smith is very talented but at times the whole movie just seems to be the Will Smith show. Will is cast as The Genie and Mariner and just doesn't have the humour and brilliance of Robin Williams or his voice in the original animated classic.Aladdin has already been humanised in the Broadway musical brilliantly but this is not a film of the musical,perhaps a pity they didn't make it one.There are only 4 original songs from the musical and one good new song for Naomi Scott to belt out 'Speechless ' an anthem to transform Princess Jasmine into a modern woman of today ready to take on any man who tries to takes her power away ,which is a good role model for children watching the movie but alas I think they'd be bored by the time it arrives.There are some very good scenes in Aladdin , like Aladdin's entrance into Agrabah,it's the best entrance into a city since Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra entered Rome and if it's the first time you've seen Aladdin there's lots to like but I hope this is the last version and I also hope and think the new humanised Lion King will be better.I imagine when Studio executives sit around discussing these hopefully multi million dollar blockbuster remakes that the main requirements discussed are ,let's pour the cash in to get an A list Star and Director plus the latest CGI which I'm beginning to think stands for Costly Graphic Indigestion.What ever happened to let's do something new and original
that hasn't been done to death before ,perhaps the last 2 or 3 poor box office performers from Disney may change their mind.
The most successful Disney revisit and not a remake lately has been Mary Poppins Returns,which cost USD 130,000,000to produce and so far World wide has grossed USD349,219,485 it out grossed Dumbo, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms ,which barely covered its production cost but I quite enjoyed for it's originality.I look forward to Lion King with Avengers :Endgame director Jon Favreau and an amazing cast I hope I can give it a 9 or 10 rating.",6,2,16,24 May 2019
The Lion King," Adds nothing and too dark in every way
","My Review -
Lion King 6.5 / 10At the risk of repeating myself and I've said this about the remake of Dumbo ,Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin if a remake of a much beloved and brilliant animation feature doesn't add anything to the original, why make it?
Of course I know the answer, especially from the viewpoint of the 21st Century Disney film Empire they bring in huge box office dollars and that's ok I suppose but I wonder what Walt Disney would have thought?The Walt Disney Studios under Walt always were striving for originality and breakthrough new projects. You only have to look at some of the extra features on Classic Disney DVD's to see how the Animators and technical teams worked expertly and together with Disney to bring something new and exciting to the screen. Unlike Studios today risks were taken like Snow White the first feature length movie cartoon that nearly everyone said would be a financial disaster but that risk saved the Walt Disney Company from bankruptcy.This Lion King remake features photorealistic CGI animals that look like the real thing so basically it's really another animated feature . Many creative and talented people have put together a pretty fair version of the 1994 original even featuring James Earl Jones repeating his original voice over as Mufasa.The problem with this version for me was unlike the fabulous 1997 Broadway musical version directed by Julie Taymar which added great songs ,choreography and gave audiences a brand new version which featured spectacular production numbers and amazing puppetry this new film adds nothing .In fact Director Jon Favreau has made a much darker version and seems to have cut back on the music and the humour. I found many of the scenes too dark visually apart from the beginning and the end it seemed to concentrate on the horrible hyenas and Scar .I might be wrong but I think very young children would be frightened by this Lion King movie , better to watch the original and best.",6,2,5,19 July 2019
Call Me by Your Name," What's all the hype about?
","Taste in movies like taste in Art or decorating is very individual and obviously many people love this sweet pretty movie but I was disappointed yet still enjoyed it. It's Oscar lead up and Call Me By Your Name is up for 4 nominations including Best Picture , Best Actor Timothee Chalamet Best Screenplay and best Song ,in my opinion Best Song is the only worthy nomination.I thought it was 40 minutes too long and that James Ivory's screenplay was contrived and reminded me of a Gay or should I say Bi Sexual version of Room With A View.
It has some lovely moments the coming of age story and sexual awakening but the plot has been done much more effectively before. The Italian setting has rustic charm the family is loving and supportive and the cast are all attractive and likeable but to me The British movie Gods Own Country also a gay coming out story was head and shoulder above this pleasant confection.",7,1,3,26 January 2018

Hidden Figures," Just as relevant today.
","I really enjoyed this movie an interesting entertaining story based on fact and a story that needed to be told of the struggle that Afro American women have had to further their careers and education at NASA in the 1960's and at last acknowledge their great contribution.. A great quote from the movie from actress Octavia Spence 's character Who plays Dorothy Vaughan to Kirsten Dunce's character Vivian Mitchell when after treating her like a lower class of human life through the movie says 'I really have nothing against your people and Octavia replies with a look of sad irony and says 'Mam, I'm sure that you may really believe that to be true' That applies so much to many people still today who think they're not racist or homophobic but dig down and the same suspicion and illusion of superiority is there.",8,2,11,16 March 2017
1917," A Triumph of a Tragedy 'Lest We Forget '
","My Review- 1917 my Rating 10/10. NO SPOILERS other than what's in the trailer.I'm amazed that I'm giving a film of my least favourite genre a perfect score but I think Sam Mendez and Krystal Wilson -Cairns who co wrote 1917 with Sam Mendez have had the final say on the futility of War and have done both their Grandfathers proud.
Both Wilson and Mendes separately say they want the film to act as a corrective to a repackaging of the war in the service of jingoistic isolationism. 'People who are attached to some sort of nostalgic vision treat these wars retrospectively as triumphs,' says Mendes. 'In fact, they were tragedies.
'That kind of hijacking of shared cultural memories and pride is very subtle, and very easy to do. At the moment, it happens all the time. 'We're going back to being on our own again! This is the spirit that fought two world wars!' That's what we're now lumbered with.'
1917 definitely is a Tragedy and I think possibly two reasons why this relatively simple story succeeds is that it's shot brilliantly in a group of single takes that have been seamlessly edited together to appear as one long take to create the impression that it's unfolding in real time . Also because co writer Krysty Wilson - Cairns unique feminine perspective has contributed an emphasis on the emotional impact . I'm sure it's her influence that helps humanise the personal sacrifice and bravery of these young men who by an accident of birth were born into an era when an entire generation on both sides was erased from the face of the earth between 1914 and 1918.
Only the human race is capable of such barbaric behaviour through the ages in the pursuit of power, territorial supremacy and hate and it's still happening today.Sam Mendes of course we know is a great Director and has dedicated this fine film to his Grandfather famed West Indian writer Alfred H. Mendes who served in the 1st Rifle Brigade, and fought for two years in Flanders, along the Belgian Front, and was awarded a Military Medal for distinguishing himself on the battlefield. Towards the end of the war, he accidentally inhaled the poisonous gas used as a weapon by the German army, and was sent back to Britain to recover.
The end credits simply say Dedicated to my Grandfather Alfred H. Mendes 'who told us the stories ' after five decades of silence when Sam Mendes asked him to tell him about the War his Grandfather was in his mid 70's he lived to be 94 years old.Sam Mendes won his first Academy Award in 2000 for the superb movie American Beauty his other great films include Road to Perdition, Revolutionary Road, SkyFall , Spectre, Little Voice and Jarhead plus many great stage productions . I predict after his Golden Globe wins for Best Director and Best Movie this week that he is assured of at least 2 more Academy Awards plus the film will be awarded a host of technical awards for '1917 'as the lighting, camera work ,editing and sets are extraordinary.The acting performances of course are all exceptional especially the two young stars
Dean- Charles Chapman as Lance Corporal Blake and George MacKay as Lance Corporal Schofield who set off on an impossible mission to deliver an order to the Captain of The Devonshire regiment to call off their planned attack and avoid an ambush that will cause the deaths of 2000 men including Corporal Blake's brother.
Top name Stars Colin Firth , David Mays and Benedict Cumberbatch have relatively small roles but add their fine stamp of quality performance to the film.1917 is at times painful and upsetting to watch it's not because of the gory battle scenes with heads being looped off or blood and guts everywhere it's more the result and cruel horrific aftermath of these battles the corpses the dead horses, and the destruction of war, it's all necessary for this film to have the impact it does have.The score by Thomas Newman son of the famous film score composer Alfred Newman is superb at times it's just a long continuous drone but elegiac in atmosphere. It reminded me of a Mahler symphony especially in the magnificent shadow and fire scenes of the burning French Village Corporal Schofield passes through on his mission. In a totally different way that scene reminded me of Sam Mende's other iconic beautiful moment in American Beauty of leaves whirling around in a wind tunnel I know It may sound odd but along with the ugly scenes of war 1917 has some beautiful moments.The film affected me personally because of my own Maternal Grandfather Herbert V Fortescue who I never knew and also fought in that war in France and who also was sent back to England to recover from poisoning by gas. I have his War Service record and 2 poignant letters one enquiring of his whereabouts by a lady who obviously cared about him and the other written by his father written in 1917 just 2 months before this film is set requesting any information regarding his son to be forwarded to his new address they put a human touch to the list of dates and battles mentioned in his service record.I've always boycotted most War films ( I did see the wonderful Australian film Danger Close The Battle of Long Tan earlier this year ) like Saving Private Ryan which I acknowledge may be the finest War Movie up to this time but 1917 in a year where there have been so many exceptional films like Joker, Little Women ,Once Upon A Time in America , The Two Popes ,Rocketman Ford v Ferrari etc 1917 stands out to me as the best as it will be a classic for ages to come to some up in 3 words Lest We Forget..",10,2,6,9 January 2020
The Piano," This revisit 30 years on was rewarding
","Isn't it extraordinary how our opinions can change over time ,well mine anyway.
After so many positive comments by people who list this film as one of their all time favourites I thought I should watch The Piano written and directed by New Zealander Jane Campion.
It must be over 30 years ago that I first saw The Piano and It was like seeing it for the first time today .I don't know why I disliked it back then ,there were a lot of changes going on in my life but today I can only praise this film and I'm so glad I was curious enough to revisit it.
There has been so much critical praise heaped on 'The Piano 'I won't add much except to praise the genius of Jane Campion ,the entire cast and technical personnel ,especially the camera people and film editors not only is it the greatest film to be produced in New Zealand but it holds its own with any film anywhere on earth.
The year it was made 1994 The Piano was up against very stiff Hollywood competition with Stephen Spielberg 'S brilliant film 'Schindler's List' if not for that I suspect I'm not the only one to think 'The Piano ' also would have one Best Picture and Best Director it thoroughly deserved it's 7 nominations and 3 wins.It's a beautiful film to watch of course the breathtakingly beautiful misty forests and sea scapes of New Zealand .
The emotional impact of Holly Hunter's Academy Award winning performance as Ada ( who doesn't have a line of dialogue except subconscious narrative ) and of course Anna Paquin as her precocious adult child daughter Flora are superb .
Anna was only one year older than Tatum O'Neil the youngest Oscar winner and has had a much more impressive film career than Tatum since her win.
The actors Sam Neil as Alisdair ,Ada's patient but ineffectual husband and Harvey Keitel as George Barnes the lonely overseer with a vivid fantasy emotional life are also very impressive in these roles .
I did wonder if the few sexual scenes could be filmed as convincingly in today's ME Too World ? the actors would have to follow much stricter guidelines I suspect.Finally I guess I'm writing this to encourage anyone who feels very strongly about or dislike a much praised movie to keep an open mind and give it another chance as I did the reward was worth it.
Ps the music of course by Michael Nyman adds to the enjoyment but it's Director and writer Jane Campion who has produced a film where even the title 'The Piano.' An inanimate object becomes almost a living character that determines all the main characters fate and destiny.",9,0,0,30 April 2020
Cold War," Great Cinema but I wanted a better conclusion.
","My Review-
Remember the great days of Foreign movie stars like Sophia Loren and Marcello MastrioannI and directors like Visconti and Fellini ?Well all these ingredients are evident in the Polish film Cold War with the pairing of Joanna Kulig as the luminous Zula a beautiful talented , calculating charismatic but damaged Polish refugee and Tomasz Kot as Wiktor the musician and her handsome rescuer and totally obsessed lover.
When we first meet Zula in 1949 desperate to join a Polish Folk Academy while on probation for stabbing her father , when Zula is asked why ? her chilling reply is
' He mistook me for my mother and the knife showed him the difference'
The story filmed magnificently in Monochrome and on a smaller screen ratio 1:37:1 in keeping with the era which covers 15 years is a love story Romeo and Juliet style , which may explain my only criticism a very odd and puzzling ending.The director Pawel Pawlikowski has created a beautiful atmosphere and ambience to suit the era
and chosen a superb cast to portray the characters.I loved the 2 music styles in this movie the Polish folk songs and dancing in the beginning and the sultry jazz in The Paris night clubs that follow on as the couples story unfolds over the years.
This film is nominated for 3 Academy awards Best Foreign Movie , Best Director and Cinematography .
Ihope it wins Best Foreign Movie , it probably won't because Roma a film , which left me totally cold and bored is the favourite of The Academy I suspect purely because of its Mexicaness and as a protest to Donald Trump.",8,0,1,8 February 2019
Hotel Mumbai," In today's world this could happen anywhere anyday-
","My Review- Hotel Mumbai.Another terrific collaboration from The South Australian Film Corporation Screen Australia the Indian and U.S.A Distribution. Company's .Their previous great success was Lion,which also starred Dev Patel and 30 cast and crew from Lion also worked on Hotel Mumbai.The quality of this production is obvious in every frame and the interior shots of Hotel Mumbai are all filmed in the studio in Adelaide and are lavish ,outdoor locations were filmed in Mumbai and Maharashtra India.Based on the terrible terrorist attacks by Islamic terrorist organisation based in Pakistan which took place in Mumbai in November 2008 where 12 separate attacks took place in the city resulting in at least 174 civilian deaths .Most of the action involves the siege at the Hotel Mumbai and is so realistic it's frightening and very disturbing at times to watch The entire ensemble cast of fine actors give such convincing performances that you feel you have witnessed an accurate account of the terror and total disregard these monsters had for human life.
Stand out performances by Dev Patel again ,cast as Arjun a Hotel Porter ,who just sets off for a normal day at work and is catapulted into a nightmare ,it made me think of the hero of The Martin Place siege Tori Johnson,who did exactly the same thing and never returned home in December 2014.Dev Patel has developed in to a fine actor since his debut in Slumdog Millionaire ,which was made in 2008 when this film is set.
Also impressive performances by Zanin Boniadi as Zahra and Armie Hammer as David her husband involved in the fight of their lives to try and escape with their baby. As mentioned the whole cast is top rate especially Anupam Khmer as Oberoi the Hotel concierge,who try's to maintain calm and the film shows the truth that the heroes of this shocking siege were the Taj Hotel courageous staff.This film is the first full feature movie for Adelaide born Producer Director and co writer of Hotel Mumbai ,Anthony Maras and I hope if this film is any indication of his talents that there will be many more to follow.Go see this movie it's certainly not The Marigold Hotel and it's confronting at times but full of Action ,great script and Production.I felt entertained ,informed and now more knowledgeable of events today in a very scary world,where no one can take anything for granted and in a world ,where we turn on the news to hear of similar atrocities and have become almost immune to the human suffering that these cowards and madmen inflict on human kind for a misguided sense of Religious Superiority.",8,85,267,14 March 2019
Midsommar," A poor imitation of The Wicker Man
","10I can't help comparing this overlong teen horror flick to the wonderful 1973 horror thriller The Wicker Man ,perhaps that's what Director writer Ari Aster had in mind to bring that type of story to a new generation.Well in my opinion he failed miserably of course taste In films is very individual and subjective and if your taste is Group hysteria under the influence of mushrooms and potions leading to satanic mating rituals and a story plot that a 5 year old could tell you the conclusion of in 2 minutes instead of 2hours 27 minutes then you may enjoy Midsommar?The basic plot is a couple of teenagers travel to Sweden to visit a rural hometown's fabled mid-summer festival. What begins as an idyllic retreat quickly devolves into an increasingly violent and bizarre competition at the hands of a pagan cult.
I read Florence Pugh said filming the superb Little Women and playing Amy March was like therapy after Midsommar and I can see why.I'm tough rating this film because the professional critics have been so savage on films like Cats 2.8 and Mrs Lowry & Son 6.6 in rating them so low. They give this bizarre nightmare a 7.2 rating when as far as I'm concerned the talent and production of those 2 earlier films alone make Midsommar look like a bad telemovie.The best moments of this film are the first 15 minutes when Dani's suspicions and worse fears for her family are realised but never explained how they connect to her Swedish Summer Camp of witches warlocks or what ever ever this strange cult of aged hippy grandmas and grandpas and lusty blonde teens call themselves.
In Hollywood they say you're only as good as you're last film and I'm glad Florence Pugh's last film Little Women is not the stinker Midsommar in my humble opinion is.",4,2,6,5 January 2020
La La Land," The best 21st Century Film Musical.
","I always think Boxing Day is the start of the movie Year , the new releases come out and then the Award movies leading up to the Academy Awards. Well today was New Years Eve I loved La La Land. not everyone will my movie partner hated it but to me it's much more than a nostalgic tribute to old Hollywood musicals, that it is but it's also touching, quirky off beat like the jazz score at times and very contemporary.No spoilers here except to say it's a bitter sweet love story judge it for yourself .A friend who is not into musicals particularly ,told me last week that he thought this movie could herald a new wave in musical cinema, the way Star Wars heralded a new genre in Sci Fi escape movies I'm not sure but I hope so the world needs to lighten up in these troubling times.It would be difficult to find a more charismatic couple than Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone their on screen chemistry at times is mesmerising. Think Vincent Minnelli , American in Paris , Umbrellas of Cherbourg and the great musical duos of Leslie Caron and Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire and Ginger I'm talking about chemistry not singing and dancing ability , even though Gosling and Stone are very talented. Summing up a joy to watch , unpredictable and very entertaining , Academy Award worthy and I also liked the music.",10,4,13,16 March 2017
The King," Impressive Film in all areas better in a Cinema
","My Review : Netflix The King. My Rating 8/10Another fine movie denied a decent Cinema release by Netflix I couldn't help thinking how spectacular some of the sets and locations would look on the giant screen.
I know it's my soapbox but I view this latest trend as a form of censorship and I hate any form of censorship. The censorship comes in the form of exclusivity to Netflix customers only.
I digress but it angers me if anyone can explain how a film that obviously costs millions of dollars to produce ( Netflix don't divulge their production costs) can recoup the costs with no advertising on Netflix just from subscriber fees I'd like to know.The King is a beautifully produced movie I notice Brad Pitt is ons of the producers and of course it's the tale of young King Henry V and the Battle of Agincourt in France in 1415 which was just one of the battles of the 100 years war.William Shakespeare wrote his play Henry V in 1599 and now 420 years later Australian Joel Edgerton and David Michod have written their version of events and written them very well indeed. Joel Edgerton is an excellent screen writer as he showed us in 2018 with the excellent film Boy Erased in which he exposed the evils of gay conversion therapy.What impressed me about The King is that it's not a 21st Century dumbed -down version the dialogue is all believable and while not Shakespearean it still has almost an 'operatic ' feel without the arias.The performances are wonderful especially Timothee Chalamet as King Henry V a young almost metrosexual pale Prince who gives up his playboy Prince sabbatical to return home and take the throne after his fathers death.There's a lot of Australian talent in The King Ben Mendelsohn is impressive as King Henry 1V and of course Joel Edgerton is very impressive as John Falstaff the Kings most loyal friend and ally. It's also beautifully directed by Australian David Michod .
Robert Pattinson gives a good brief performance as the nasty threatening Dauphin of France who taunts the young King and ultimately falls on his sword.It's interesting that Timothee Chalamet and beautiful Lily-Rose Depp ,who is lovely as the French Princess Catherine are actually romantically involved because Timothee's meteoric rise to stardom reminds me of Lily-Rose's father Johnny Depp's amazing career start except I think Timothee is developing into a better actor with greater range .
I'm looking forward to seeing him in Little Women later this week at The Cinema on a decent sized screen in a movie that all film goers can see without having to subscribe to a streaming channel.The King is a long film 2hours 20 minutes,it's not a fast paced action movie but Australian director David Michod who also wrote and directed Animal Kingdom is an expert at portraying his characters personality and emotional state and I imagine he's a Dream director for actors to work with.It's interesting to see the role of English King Henry V played by a New Yorker of French decent and in contrast an English actor cast as the Dauphin of France The King is a very impressive film.",8,4,6,30 December 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Is this one version too many?
","This is the 7th film version of Beauty and The Beast and I really wonder why they made another, especially seeing it's part human and part animation but it works . It's neither a film version of the Broadway stage hit or a Human version of the great fully animated Disney feature film. It does have all the magic and effects that Disney dollars can throw at a film and a few new songs and plot twists.The cast is very capable especially Emma Watson, who sings well and looks suitably enchanting as a true Disney Princess should . It's was fun to see some favourites of mine like Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobes and Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts . The new songs by Alan Menken don't really add anything to his original score in fact I think they made a mistake by not including Human Again in this film it's a great production number and I missed it, perhaps it's on the DVD extras cost certainly couldn't have been a factor in dropping it with Disney dollars behind it.In conclusion it's a good film with reservations I prefer the 1946 Jean Cocteau version, watched it recently with new Phillip Glass opera soundtrack or The fully human live Broadway musical production, but yes it's lovely and pays little tributes to The Sound of Music opening scene Maria twirling while 'The Hills are Alive 'and little references to the Original Cocteau version but please no more Beauty and The Beasts , that's enough!",7,1,4,22 March 2017
The Shape of Water," There is Magic still in Fairytales-
","The Shape of Water, is possibly the most unusual love story ever filmed.
As they say it's not who you love that matters and we all see love in different ways..
If you enjoyed Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece Pans Labyrinth I think you'll enjoy this movie.
It's fantasy, nostalgia and suspense told as an adult fairytale.
Superb performance by one of my favourite actresses Sally Hawkins , did you see her in Maudie now that's the movie I think she should have won an Academy award for but she's one of the favourites this year and roles where actors play handicapped characters that are deaf, mute, or blind usually win Academy awards.
A great supporting cast including Octavia Spencer but i'll single out Michael Shannon as the most evil villain since The Queen in Snow White and Richard Jenkins ,nominated as best supporting actor well deservedly for his role of Giles the 'Good Queen 'in this Adult Fairytale.
I particularly loved the music by my favourite cinema composer of today
Alexander Desplat.
Like La La Land some will love this movie some will hate it but I think originality and good story telling is what makes cinema so enjoyable.",10,28,50,30 January 2018
Joker," No joking Joaquin is Superb!
","My Review- Joker.( No Spoilers from me don't let anyone tell you the climax) !My rating 9/10 would have been 10 if it wasn't so dark and disturbing.Well all the hype about Joaquin Phoenix performance as Joker and the 11 minute standing ovations at the Venice Film Festival are justified. I feel sorry for any actor in this year leading up to the Oscars 2020 as they have as much chance of an Oscar as our Prime Minister Scomo has of landing on Mars.He is astonishing ! Not Scomo Joaquin.I just hope it was all acting as Im sure it was Joaquin Phoenix has proved his acting prowess before in films like Walk the Line, Her and The Master and had been nominated for 3 acting Academy awards but never won I predict that will happen in 2020.Our own great actor Heath Ledger was strongly rumoured after his premature death in 2008 to have been totally consumed disturbed and exhausted after being cast as The Joker In The Dark Knight and was awarded a posthumous Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor.Up until this new version entirely devoted to the rise of The Joker character set of course in Gotham City when Bruce Wayne (Batman) is only a toddler Heath Ledger was the darkest portrayal ever but Joaquin is far more disturbing he looks wasted physically and mentally he off the Richter scale but his version is such an intelligent and sympathetic one that it gives an insight and understanding into mental illness and just what sends a man over the edge to insanity.Director Todd Phillips and his crew of scenic designers and cinematographers and costume makers have created a dark and gloomy Gotham City where crime anarchy and where the poor disenfranchised and ignorant population are jealous and antagonistic to the middle classes and the lawmakers.As a matter of fact for me just as an observation on today's real world problems Gotham and its inhabitants chillingly reminded me of the anarchy on the streets of Hong Kong even to the point of the masked demonstrators and the increasing violence coming from both the students and the Police.Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin the top rating talk show host is also superb and we witness two great actors together in the interactions with Arthur Fleck (The Joker) and Murray Franklin who represents the populist media magnet chasing ratings and revenue.Francis Conroy as Arthur's mother is also worthy of a best supporting actress nomination in what must have been a very different mother role to Ruth Fisher, Nate and David's gentle but complex mother in the top rating 2001-2005 series Six Feet Under.This is as strange and haunting film , it's very confronting and disturbing I'll be honest and say I don't even know if I liked it but I enjoyed it cinematically and give it top marks for the artistry and creativity of the Production team and most of all for one of the finest portrayals of a character ever seen on film . Bravo Joaquin Phoenix.
Ps Stephen Sondheim's Send In The Clowns will never be the same . It's not about Clowns at all but hope Stephen Sondheim was paid a fortune.",9,1,5,3 October 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Interesting ,Entertaining and well Produced Cinema
","IT's rare that we think of the unthinkable fact of what would have happened if Britain had been invaded by Germany in World War 2?
Well it's a fact that Guernsey was and this story tells with humour , pathos and sadness the plight of a group of citizens who become .friends under incredibly difficult circumstances, living under curfew and the barest of food to survive occupation and having to surrender to anything the Nazi occupiers wanted or face extreme punishment.
The cast is fabulous with a knockout performance by Penelope Wilton, as much as I adore Dame Judy and Dame Maggie I'm so glad they didn't get the part of Amelia Maugery, a sad traumatised woman, who has lost more and sacrificed more than anyone should have to in that horrible war. We all know Penelope as Isobel Crawley in Downtown Abbey and this role is so far removed from that one .
I've seen her in many other fine roles going way back to Alan Ayckbourn 's Norman Conquests in 1977 but I think this film is her finest hour.
Lily James as Juliet Ashton the author who is drawn to Guernsey and the tales of these people also gives another lovely performance, for some reason she reminds me of Lyn Hathaway and I expect after her great roles in Cinderella, Darkest Hour and Guernsey that we will see her in many more movies.
Everyone is good in this movie , special mention to veteran Tom Courtney, who pays an eccentric wistful character Eben Ramsey.
No wonder this film works with a director like Mike Newell, who has directed great films like Four Weddings and a Funeral, Harry Potter Goblet of Fire and Donnie Brasco.
If you enjoy a great story beautiful scenery and terrific acting please don't miss this Film a 9 out of 10 from this amateur film buff.",9,0,1,31 August 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Why did they bother?
","Why did Kenneth Branagh want to make a third version of this classic Agatha Christie story knowing remakes of classic films rarely are successful?The previous two versions the film in 1974 with Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot and the 2010 television version with David Suchet are both superb.If you haven't seen either you probably may enjoy this as I don't criticise the acting or production . It's an interesting cast I enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Caroline Hubbard so classily played in the original by Lauren Bacall and Branagh gives a credible performance as Poirot.What I missed was the elegance of the original the original score by Richard Rodney Bennett is one of my all time favourite film scores ,used so evocatively in the original film it gave the Orient Express an identity motif forever etched in film history.The music score in this attempt is bland and the song at the end credits so saccharine sweet and forgettable I've forgotten it already.If you make a remake film that's so well known you can't help comparing the original cast and in 1974 we had Albert Finney, Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall , Dame Wendy Huller , Richard Widmark, Sean Connery, John Gielgud , Rachel Roberts and Vanessa Redgrave to name a few , yet not one of the new cast including Dame Judy Dench eclipses any of the performances of the original film . The costumes and sets are very good in this version but again in 1974 even without blue screens and cgi effects the elegance and luxury of the original is not improved with this version. So to me the good performances and production of this movie were wasted on this expensive film and the tweaking of the story line was totally unnecessary and in one instance concerning the Caroline Hubbard role ridiculous.Without giving anything away or spoiling it for audiences who haven't seen the original, apart from recommending the 1974 version to this one I was horrified at the hint at the end of the movie that Kenneth Branagh may remake 'Death on the Nile'I sincerely hope not. What next will we a have Kenneth Branagh remake of Gone With The Wind starting himself as Rhett Butler and Anne Hathaway as Scarlett?",5,177,276,8 November 2017
Parasite," The Privilege Class crashes into the Working poor
","My Review- Parasite
My Rating 9/10I'm so glad I got to finally see Parasite today on the day it won 2 well deserved BAFTA British Academy Awards Best Movie not in The English Language and Best Original Screenplay for its writer/ director Bong Joon Ho.Parasite has already received numerous accolades, with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best International Feature Film, making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.The film's title 'Parasite' was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said 'Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.'I read Director and script writer Bong Joon
is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home.
I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film.Unfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon.
It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on.
Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce.Of course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year .
I still think it's odd to include this film in 2 Best Film Categories at next weeks Academy Awards it had no chance of winning Best Picture but I'm certain it will win Best International Feature Film and it probably deserves to. I'm still so fond of Pedro AlmodÃ³var's Pain & Glory..Ps an add on comment after seeing Parasite on a Cinema screen the best way to appreciate a film like this.After seeing Parasite on a Cinema Screen at last I appreciate the movie even more.
There's so much to absorb and think about in the layers of Pasasite. The story depicts Class divides, Climate Catastrophes, Nuclear War fear and Violence due to mental illness and resentment.
I was wrong in my first review to think Parasite had no chance of Winning Best Film of the year and I still think it's unfair that films in a Foreign Language have 2 bites of the Best Film cherry but this movie is a great film .This is not a new review my original will do but just an observation after seeing 'Emma' this week which portrayed Upper Class 19th Century snobbery and class division then the excellent HBO series 'Succession 'portraying an incredibly wealthy Media magnates family living a life of incredible privilege financed by greed and cunning plotting the next coup.
The common thread that Parasite, Emma and Succession have is total separation from the feelings and aspirations of anyone outside their Class it's survival at all costs and disregard anyone who smells differently speaks differently, dresses differently or anyone doesn't process a degree or wealth.
The poor family's ingenious scheme to obtain a better life regardless of the outcome shows more intelligence and hope to improve their situation than the insular, neurotic self obsessed rich Park family.2 comments from Parasite said by Ki-taek and wife Chung-sook stay in my mind .Ki-taek: They are rich but still nice.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: They are nice because they are rich.Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: If I had all this I would be kinder.Ki-taek: Rich people are naive. No resentments. No creases on them.
Chung-sook, Ki-taek's wife: It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money.Both families end up with creases and resentments in Parasite so I guess both families fit the definition of Parasites-parasiteLearn to pronounce

Marriage Story," Watch Kramer Vs Kramer instead
","My Review - Marriage Story
My Rating 6.5It's disappointing when I'm a fan of the main star Scarlett Johansson and I'm not rubbishing her portrayal of Nicole a sulky pouty ,irritating and self obsessed actress .
Nicole want out and is not the slightest bit interested in trying to save her fading marriage even though it seemed quite obvious to me that the couple still were attracted and somewhat affectionate to each other.Then we have Adam Driver as the husband Charlie who strayed once according to Nicole ,although this is never really established it just seems that Nicole thinks she's invisible to him and not valued while it's clear if it wasn't for Charlie's success as a stage director she wouldn't have a stage career at all.Why am I even trying to explain 2 hours 17minutes of a tedious couple screaming ,yelling and outdoing each other's accusations and revisiting each bump and grind in their tedious relationship. I felt so sorry for their young son Henry and hope his Dad got custody.The acting is good especially Laura Dean as Nora Fanshaw the self interested crass Hollywood divorce lawyer who encourages Nicole to go for broke and Ray Liotta as Jay Marotta the even more greedy New York lawyer Charlie ,who never wanted to go through court and nasty legal battles engages on his behalf when his wife decides the opposite.Another Netflix one month Cinema release the film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on August 29 2019 and began a limited theatrical release on November 6 and exactly one month later December 6 (to qualify for Awards season) began digital streaming on Netflix to great critical acclaim but not from me .I much prefer a far better film on the subject of a marriage breakup the brilliant 1979 Kramer Vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep it had style substance and two much more interesting characters than Marriage Story and told their story in 1hour and 45 minutes.",6,57,102,21 December 2019
Black Panther," Intelligent actors and plot
","It's great to escape to other realms and Kingdoms every now and then and this was a Super adventure.
Sci Fi Marvel adventures are not usually my genre of movie but something about the trailer made me want to see this one.
Yes it's the usual testosterone charged romp of good versus evil but what's wrong with that?
Especially when the technical aspects are so fabulous and this movie has a heart.
The CGI at times is breathtaking I may have to try and see it in 3D.
The cast are all terrific, and good to see the women in this movie have equal power and presence.
Surely it must be up for Oscars next year I suspect it missed the deadline for this years.
Highly recommended by me if you like intelligent SciFi action or just like a really good movie.",9,4,10,2 April 2018
Black Panther," Spielberg at his best -
","Spielberg at his best;
I really enjoyed this escape from reality and the homage to so many movies and cultural icons Steven Spielberg has managed to cram into this game within a game movie.
A few weeks ago I reviewed another virtual reality movie a (rom com) Game Night , which I really loathed and thought absolute crap so I was a little sceptical about Ready Player One.
Last Sunday we visited our neighbours very switched on and clever Grandson Callum for his 9th birthday celebration and he was engrossed in his new video game with head set in place and I could see it had captured his imagination and I spotted his Avatar or virtual reality identity in full destroyer battle mode.
I wish now I'd taken up his invitation to join in the game as I've never played a video game but there's always next time.
This experience unknowingly prepared me for this movie in which has cleverly combined real actors , who live in a bleak futuristic 2045 in dismal residential towers called 'The Stacks'.
The occupants of this dark and shattered world escape to the Oasis a virtual realty world where fantasy is the aim and adventure is the game.
Some have said this may be Spielberg 's greatest movie I'm not sure about that sweeping statement but it's up there with ET and Close Encounters.
A terrific youthful cast headed by Tye Sheridan as Parzival, our hero and Olivia Cooke as his capable side kick and romantic interest are the young game players but I was also impressed by the villain Australia 's Ben Mendelsohn as Sorrento and Mark Rylance as Anorak and the inventor of the Oasis James Halliday.
Also loved the music and the fact that what could seem a bleak future Spielberg has transformed into a spectacular colourful world where the human element is most the important component.
It's more about friendship , loyalty and caring for your fellow humans and reality really wins out in the end.
A High Five ! and I'll add 4 to score this movie a 9.",9,0,5,25 April 2018
The Greatest Showman," Moulin Rouge meets La La Land
","My last movie review for 2017-
and it's a good one, I loved this original screen musical not as much as La La Land but think Moulin Rouge meets La La land and there are similarities.
If you don't like musicals ,perhaps this movie may not appeal but if you enjoy an interesting story based on some fact and plenty of spectacle and a very talented cast headed by Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum you may enjoy this cleverly crafted film.
I love musicals and there are plenty of original songs and great Circus choreography in The Greatest Showman.
Michelle Williams is delightful as Barnum's wife and Zac Efron , plays a great supporting role as Barnum's business partner.
I'll be pleasantly surprised if this is a great box office success I hope it is because it deserves success and has a timely message 
of accepting and celebrating diversity and differences inhuman kind.
It's not what a person looks like physically that counts even if their a bearded lady or a giant or dwarf it's the similarities we should celebrate not their differences.
There's been some great movies this year and some duds but this is a good one to end the year with.",8,0,2,29 December 2017
Jojo Rabbit," This is no Mel Brooks 'The Producers' Not Funny and Offensive
",I can't believe that this film is nominated for best film instead of Rocketman the Elton John bio but it seems I'm out of step . It may be perhaps that I'm part of a generation born in 1949 at the end of the era that the 2nd World War occurred and can't find any hilarity in its aftermath.As I often say Film appreciation is a very personal thing often depending on our own life experience and views I never mind differing from the mainstream view as shown with my Review of Cats recently or agreeing with the mainstream as shown in my reviews of 1917 or Little Women but I know what I like and expect in Cinema and I also know that they're will always be 'Emperors New Clothes ' films and if I see it that way I have to call it as I see it.What will people find funny next a comedy about 9/11 or GayBashing or even the evils of Child Abuse in Religious organisations may be the subject of 'comedy satire'in the future.,5,1,5,14 January 2020
Midway," Like a 2 hour electronic war game nothing new to add
","My Review - Midway
My Rating 6:5/10
I've said before I'm not a fan of War films but top quality productions like Dunkirk , 1917, and the great Australian movie Danger Close : The Battle of Long Tan I really enjoyed and they're easy to praise for their great script and production values but Midway is nowhere near the standard of those films.In my opinion 'Midway ' a modern remake of the 1976 film starring Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda ,James Coburn and Glenn Ford has probably superior special effects but I didn't engage with this retelling at all probably because I knew the outcome but more because the script was so poor. As an example the wife of Dick Best played by Ed Skrein when told her man is possibly shot down in battle says emotionally that she has to powder her nose some more' and the same Ed Skrein ( I'm sure he was channeling the late John WAYNE) when rallying his men says something along the lines of 'the wagons are circling and we'll shoot em down one by one ' There's something so predictable about scripts in
most not all American War movies.
The Hollywood Studios wouldn't touch Midway
* Roland Emmerich Director of Independence Day, 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow couldn't interest Hollywood studios in the US$100 million on for the project .Director Roland Emmerich would even take trips to Beijing to meet with potential Chinese financiers. In the end, the production received close to US$24 million from Chinese investors including Starlight Group, which funds Emmerich's company Centropolis .
It will be interesting to see if the Chinese investors get their investment returned?
So far the estimated budget for Midway was USD 100,000,000 so far Worldwide it's made a total of $123.3 million so it's possibly a modest box office success but certainly not a critical success.For those who like American War Films or that genre in general the visual effects are outstanding but the script and some of the performances are ' B'grade in my estimation. I don't enjoy electronic War games and felt I'd been playing one for 2 hours as it's mainly battle scenes throughout and while it's a fitting tribute to the brave men who fought in this horrific battle and those who lost their lives at Pearl Harbour it's all been done before and adds no new perspective but that's just my opinion.",6,1,3,17 February 2020
Green Book," Driving Miss Daisy in Reverse gear- Superb!
","My Review-This is the best film of the year as far as I'm concerned and deserves the 5 Academy Award nominations it' nominated for,in fact I'll go as far as to say it should win all five, if I had a vote Green Book would win Best Film, Best Actor,Best Supporting Actor, Best Director and Best Screenplay.Why? Because It's the most touching and revealing story of two human beings ,poles apart in every way who experience through the challenging experiences of racial prejudice and more importantly their own personal perceptions and prejudices of each other in the America of the mid 1960's ,two very different halves of a nation that is still divided in 2019.I couldn't help comparing this movie to the great film of 1989 ,Bruce Beresford 'S classic Driving Miss Daisy ,except in Green Room their driving in reverse gear with Viggo Mortensen in role of Tony Lip ,a tough Italian rough diamond who's racial ignorance is truly shown early in the movie when he returns home to his lovely wife Dolores,played beautifully by Linda Cardellini to find 2 coloured plumbers in his home.
Out of sheer economic desperation after being laid off from his job he applies and accepts a position as driver for Dr Don Shirley,a classical and high brow jazz pianist impeccably played by Marhershala Ali,and they set off on a concert tour of America's Deep South ,where the title of the movie is revealed and says it all.Tony's employer and passenger is Don Shirley a elegant,cultured ,talented and incredibly wealthy Afro American concert pianist who is lonely and isolated from the reality of racial prejudice in New York society,totally opposite to Tony ,who has a loving family ,uneducated,can barely write a letter to his wife and comes out with every racial stereotype comment not through hate but just plain ignorance.The journey the two men embark on has a destination more than just the red neck bigoted towns they arrive in ,when they return home they both have arrived at the most important destination, a better knowledge of themselves and their humanity and a better grasp of the defects
of character that have held them both back all their lives,it bought a tear to my eye and that's why it should win the 5 Academy Awards its nominated for, it's a rare and splendid movie.",10,1,3,24 January 2019
