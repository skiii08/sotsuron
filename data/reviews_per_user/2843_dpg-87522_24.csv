Ford v Ferrari," One of the best movies of the 2019.
","Ford v Ferrari is one of those few movies based on well-made real events, which means that most of these types of movies concentrate more on telling the event that happened and completely forget about telling a good story based on facts. real with interesting characters, funny moments, visually entertaining scenes, etc. And that is exactly why Ford v Ferrari is such a good movie, it does all of the above and more, and all that is topped off with the incredible performances of Christian Bale and Matt Damon and the chemistry they manage to do between the two. The film does not lack action or humor, both are perfectly leveled, humor is not silly this is introduced in a good way, something that other films of this genre do not understand, in real life there are comic moments, people laughs, not because it is a film based on real events means that there can be no comedy, of course it can as long as it is within reason, just as the action is great, neither more nor less is not forced or anything like that, and those would be the main elements that make the film visually attractive. The film does well not to put the protagonists aside, it gives the characters a touch of personality which makes them interesting, while telling their story, but let's be honest the real protagonist is Ken Miles (Christian Bale) because the film focuses more on his personal life, than that of Carroll Shelvy (Matt Damon), since it sets him the goal of overcoming himself physically and psychologically, and Ken is a true race driver, to hell with Dominic Toretto I want Ken Miles. But despite all that the character of Matt Damon is not far behind he also tries to overcome either because of his health problems overcome that he will not be able to compete anymore, and building a car faster than those of Ferrari at any cost. The film did well by not showing Ferrari as an evil company to win, it is only a battle of companies, even when Ken wins the race at the end Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) shows his respect, one competes against another not because one is good and the other bad, but because of what all companies want money, they want to have the best product to sell, although we support Ford not because they are good or something, but by perspective, we support Ford because the protagonists are with Ford, we would support Ferrari if the protagonists were with Ferrari, in fact the closest to being a villain in this movie would be Leo Bee (Josh Lucas) who is on the side of Ford, and I say the closest because it really is not bad within reason, he just has personal problems with Ken, he doesn't like it, he doesn't want it. And speaking of Ken, I loved his death, I say it moved me, but I say I liked it because it was a great element added to the movie, I think this because it was not something that was removed from the sleeve, the problem of the brakes and of not being able to get out of the car, it had already been used previously in the film, which gives a great touch to Ken's death, it happened once I managed to survive, another happened but this time he wasnt so lucky, The address, although it is not the best in the world, is great, there are several scenes that I can't think of as they were recorded, obviously if there were one with another with special effects, but in other words it is the best part of Mangold. Actually the only complaint I have to this movie would be Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) is not that I did not like the character on the contrary I like it, but the problem is that in the first act you are introduced as 3rd protagonist, but As the film progresses, it loses prominence, taking away its place of 3rd protagonist. In conclusion Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies of 2019, which I really think should be nominated for best film, with a good story, interesting characters, epic moments, great performances, a great direction from Goldman and apart from its best movie, I think this movie is a good 9/10.",8,1,3,18 November 2019
The Irishman," The old men redeem themselves to bring us a good movie
","Martin Scorsese is a director considered by many to be the best in history, whether for bringing us movies like 'Goodfellas,' 'Taxi Driver,' or how he directs and the way he makes use of music, so When they announced that they would release a new movie, many people got excited because Martin Scorsese does not disappoint and this is no exception, this time he brings us with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, actors who had lowered their reputation, a movie 3 h 30 minutes, about Frank Sheeran a former war veteran who ends up getting involved in organized crime becoming his hitman, this is a movie that really is not for everyone because of its long duration, if you are willing to see it you have to prepare , otherwise it won't be possible for you to enjoy it. One of the biggest mistakes of the movie in my opinion are those of rejuvenating the actors, let's be honest Joe Pesci looks like plastic and De Niro is just the same as with the most blue eyes and black hair, I take this as a mistake because they could do much better, I say even a user on YouTube managed to do better. Also to tell the truth the movie is unnecessarily long, it is because the story that it has to tell is a story that frankly can be told in less time, but hey my opinion, maybe for someone the movie feels short and in fact should last longer. Obviously the successes of the film are bigger, the interpretation of Joe Pesci seemed very good, it is different because it is known for playing aggressive characters, in 'Goodfellas' I play a violent Gangster who was carried away by emotions and In Home Alone I play a violent man who liked to harass minors. The same can be said of Alpacino and De Niro, great performances, as for the story one would think that it is the typical story of a man who is ascending in the world of the mafia and then falls, narrated intelligently using three timelines each with its purpose, what differentiates this from other gangster and gangster movies is that it focuses more on issues such as friendship or oblivion, therefore it ends up being an interesting and engaging story, and as I said Scorsese manages to execute it very Well, I found the soundtrack great, the uses of music and all that, I liked the environment because it has that touch of 'Goodfellas', several scenes are very similar. And that is all I have to say about 'The Irishman', so in conclusion 'The Irishman is a 3-and-a-half hour movie, which could last less, with good special effects except on the part of rejuvenating Joe Pesci already De Niro, but with great performances, a good direction, a striking environment, a great soundtrack, and a well-adapted script",8,2,5,6 January 2020
Interstellar," One of the best NolanÂ´s movies
","Christopher Nolan is one of those directors who do not see each day, is known and respected for the trilogy of the knight of the night and for telling his stories in different chronological order. Interstellar was a film acclaimed both by critics and by the audience, it could be said that these were the main reasons why I wanted to see it, apart from Matthew McConaughey being the protagonist. The movie has a good start, because you understand who is who and what you need to know about the main characters. The performances are as always in the excellent Nolan movies, the comrade movements seemed good to me, the environment I loved because it is not fictional, you think that what you are seeing is real. The script is great in the sense that you can understand that Nolan made him want since he even bothered to ask a professional in Astronomy to help write the script. The plot may sound something simple but it is really very complex, it would be that the characters have to find a habitable approach to save humanity from extinction, if that sounds very simple, but it is not because there is more like that mission itself was a farce and the human relationships of the characters. The relationships of the characters feel real, the movie made me feel how the characters felt, it is very emotional to see how Cooper takes his time to decide whether to go to the mission to save humanity or stay with his children in the earth, for example when Cooper is taking the mission and his daughter tries to reach him desperately, you manage to feel the sadness that the characters feel at that moment, and that is something that not many films achieve, if their realization with Murph is quite complex, you could say that the main theme of the film is love, everything is done for love, in fact you could say that love is what saves humanity, the connection between Murph and Cooper is so strong that it helps Murph to save the humanity from extinction. But no matter how emotional it is, Nolan did not make a perfect movie, since in itself, it makes no sense that a secret government organization hires a subject who has not seen in years for such an important mission, and when the characters go to the water planet and one of the characters stays on the ship, I understand that the hours spent there were 20 years on earth and on the ship, therefore I have to ask myself questions like: How the hell did that guy survive 20 years on the ship alone without losing his sanity, entertaining himself and not resorting to suicide? Did they have provisions for 20 years? Wow, that guy really deserves all my respect, for surviving that, and the truth is that something that surprised me about Nolan was that, it was very obvious those who were going to die and those who were going to live, I say they surprised me because Nolan He is a respected director for not making mediocre mistakes, if he may make mistakes in his movies, but not as mediocre and repetitive as that. In conclusion Interstellar is a film that I personally liked very much, with good performances, an interesting environment, a good direction, characters with personality, but with things that have weight for plot, which are the opposite of reality, this movie It deserves a 7/10 but I will make an exception, for the good attitudes, for the complexity of the protagonists, because Nolan took the trouble to ask for help from a professional for the script and because I am very entertained, it is because that this movie for me is an 8/10.",8,1,1,5 October 2019
The Godfather: Part II," So great,but not better than the first one.
","For me the Godfather trilogy is the best trylogy of all, this second part is so great, but is not better than the first one i have heard that a lot of people said that this part is better than the first one and is not, why?Well the answer of that is very simple, is because the first one had a story more interesting and had all the characters,charecters that they are not in this movie because they are dead, interesting characters,and yeah this second part give you new characters but they are not as interesting as the first one. But seeing the good side thhe conflict of the movie is very interesting and dramatic, as in the first one the performeance of Al pacino and the other actors is great, and the evolucion and the evolution of Michael Corleone is incredible, and i like very much that the movie tells you the orgins of Don Corleone.This movie, more than anything, tells us about Michael's path in the life of crime, everything he is doing and the bad decisions he has made. Finally the ending of the movie is great,because reminds you of what Michael used to have with a scene of him eating with his family and then he changes the scene to a lonely Michael who really has nothing left.",9,2,2,8 August 2019
Justice League," A desperate attempt from DC to level with Marvel.
","If I had to choose between DC or Marvel, I really prefer DC, let's be realistic in what marvel wins DC is in films of cinematic universe, in video games DC wins, in comics for the simple fact that it has the best history comic (Watchmen) wins, in movies outside any cinematic universe wins, in series well it is difficult because the only good series of marvel is Daredevil and that including the fact that really that is the best superhero series , so I will give marvel the point, but the point is that when DC strives for something it does very well, but when DC tries to do something for which it was not done it gives us this: Want to add a caption to this image? Click the Settings icon. While Justice League is better than Batman and Robin, that does not mean that it is above the mediocre, the biggest problem is that the film is so childish, the characters lack personality, the closest we have to a poorly developed personality would come being that of a boy who is angry at his dad for saving his life (Cyborg), the way Batman gathers the members is so simple is like a superhero ball game, Batman and the wonder woman go over there, over there asking everyone if they want to join their team of super friends, and all without considering it too much end up accepting. Something that I liked about Avengers: The avengers was that they really spend most of the movie stripping between them than with the villain of the movie which is completely normal and realistic because it really is the first time they live with each other, and it is normal that they do not get along, but in this movie no, here everyone is super friends who have no problem between them, which is the opposite of real life. And of all the villains they could choose, they chose Stevephen Wolf, the villain that only the fat man of the Simpsons knows and three more people in the world, instead of having put Darkside they put to that gift nobody that their objective is so silly and simple, destroy the earth because ......... Yes? Now everyone will think that darkside is the copy of thanos when it is the other way around, darkside came out first, in fact the avengers are the copy of the justice league, but now nobody will believe that because DC has not made good use of its content. The biggest problem is that the film focuses more on making a story for the next films than on making a good story for this one, that seller is the biggest problem in the movie, great proof that they didn't try very hard are the special effects, Let's be honest for the era in which we are those special effects are no longer valid, they are simply bad, and flash has its blue rays Why ........? Because Zack Snyder came from h $% # s. Do you want to add a title to this image? Click on the Settings icon. The movie had done well not to show Superman in the trailers, you didn't know how it was going to come back or how it was going to be, etc., but it is made to lose all that and gives us the typical story that revived someone and becomes evil blah blah blah, and as always love solves everything and a bing bang bung Superman returns to normal, and no one bothers to investigate because he is alive, instead the film better concentrates on making jokes fools, but this blatantly believes that if you copy a wonder your use formula stupid jokes everyone would love their movies, bad DC, bad. And as almost always happens in this type of movies lately, everything else is more of the same, they beat the villain and everyone lives according to the idea that men with super powers without supervision live among them. In conclusion Justice League is a simple and mediocre action movie that although I dare to say that it was something attractive to see the justice league for the first time together in a live action movie, but it does not stand out in any sense, the villain It's boring and repetitive as is the story, the special effects are terrible and I want to say that this criticism would be worth nothing if it were those marvelitas that praise a wonder as if it were a god, so if you are a DC fan and this movie you nice to let me tell you that the only thing you are is a sheep that has to be told what to do, what to think and that you never accept that your pastor can be wrong, assuming it is somewhat exaggerated to give this movie a 3/10 so that's why I'll give a 4/10 better.",4,0,0,1 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The most overrated movie of the year.
","When I say that Avengers Engame is the most overrated movie of 2019, I mean that people and critics praised it more, the movie, yes, you could say that it is 'good', but not so much for everyone to go crazy and say that it is the best superhero movie, a great example of how overrated it would be like, this movie was recently titled as the highest grossing movie in the history of cinema in general. Yes, if the film is very striking with its colors and all those characters, but simply what in Avengers Infinity War 'struggled' to maintain the quality of the plot, here it simply does not matter, I just say that Captain Marvel suddenly find Tony and the other lady, they do not explain at any time how he did to find them, yes, if I know that the marvel lovers have already drawn their theories on that, to cover up the lazy mistakes of the writers. In Infinity War we saw the Thor plus Thor of the Thores, but now he is an obese alcoholic, the movie is not taken seriously sometimes, and that is a great example, or that Tony gets angry at first with Captain America because he does not It was there, blah, blah, blah, but if we use our brains, you will remember that in Infinity War he had the opportunity to call him and he did not, so I'm sorry Iron man lovers, but Tony had no right to get angry, and if we analyzed him well really Captain Marvel was a filler character, we all believed that this character would have great weight for the story but no, I thought that they did not try hard in their movie because they were going to want all this, but no, you can feel that the writers they didn't know what to do with it, and something they did go over with was the rat that accidentally released Ant-man, I'm just saying that you are more likely to see a cow flying outside your house to have that happen, which I leave wondering if the truck was closed, then how did that rat could get in? The time travel is very badly done, quantum physics clearly says that two equal objects cannot be together at the same time in the same place, so that fight of the American captains is impossible, and the rest is not even said , for example, Captain America in the end stays in the past meaning that The Avengers never had Captain America, which means that everything he did never happens, which leaves me wondering. Why did nothing change? Why is there no temporary paradox or any consequence for your decision? It's simple, the movie is so shameless in the sense that it doesn't care about those rules and does what it gives the gift wins. After that for no reason, Steve gives his position to Falcon because ............. in order to make a reference to the comics, he prefers to give his position to an African-American who he met recently Than your lifelong friend. Something that I honestly didn't understand, was how the gauntlet works, are you supposed to think about what you want and what happens? I don't know, I think, because Hulk throne his fingers and half of the universe that had disappeared comes back, but here goes the problem, if you think about it that is the worst thing he had to do, Thanos technically had already saved the universe by reducing the population , and that was something that the Avengers failed to understand, but that is the least, the problem is that being logical, of that half world literally literally, I wonder where the hell are all these people going to live? 5 years have passed and obviously their houses must already be inhabited by someone else, or their jobs, and logically they should have had an economic imbalance, but hey, the Avengers don't care about that and they are happy because they saved their friends, just I say his plan was very selfish. If you think about it really, the one who lost the most was Thanos, his goal was really not bad, that for starters, even in a part of the movie Steve tells Natasha something that the planet is less polluted Thanos was looking for his stones for a long time time and when he found the last one to get it he had to sacrifice his daughter, he also lost his friends, henchmen or not dry were, then after saving the universe, he just wanted to live in peace and eat his broth, but the Avengers do not arrive and they kill him, then they make a plan for all their sacrifices to go to waste, poor Thanos. To tell the truth that Hulk is now Hulk-Banner does not really bother me, what I would have liked is that they would have spent time on that, for example a movie of that would not be bad. But well now talk about how good this movie has, and I'd like to start with those little big details, which would be like Hulk uses a pencil to press the keys because his fingers are too big, or that Iron Man gives the hug to that Spiderman did not want to give him at Homecomeming, also that Bucky tells Steve that he is going to miss him although he is supposed to only leave for a few seconds, but it is because he knows him enough to know that Steve is going to live his life, and that that would be the last time he sees him young and for me that he is the best he would be being that in the final battle with Thanos, Thor every blow he hits is directed at Thanos's head. And as brave as it has been to kill Ironman, it was really a bit forced, although the only thing I managed to sacrifice was to avoid the salvation of the universe. I will analyze the advantage and cons. Pros: -Give more years of life to humanity before it destroys itself. -They managed to complete their goal. Cons: -To condemn humanity. -Leave his wife a widow. -Let your daughter an orphan. - Wreck the work of a visionary. -Kill oneself. But the point is that the greatest hero of Marvel was sacrificed, the man who created Ultron, the man who caused the civil war between his companions and then locked them in, the man who created all those marvel villains like the Vulture , Mystery, Mandarin, etc. But hey, goodbye Ironman. So and I have two questions for marvel lovers. How is it possible for a human being to create a gauntlet that supports the gems of infinity, when Infinity War told us that only a certain metal made by certain dwarves can do it? The only conclusion I reach is that Tony is a god or a celestial being. I also understand that if he is a god, he would be Ojo de Alcon, since he is in a moment of the movie he grabs a gem of the infinite with his hand and in guardians of the galaxy I learned that only a celestial or a god can grab the gems without dying, and in this movie, Ojo de alcon grabs it and nothing happens, so I understand that this man is a god or a celestial. Do not? Something that I admire about this movie is that it is very good lying, to this I mean that it is so good lying that it made half the world believe that it is the best film not only of the year, not only of the genre of Super-heroes, but of the best movies in history, they are good lying that with the jokes, the characters, the fights and all those colors of this movie, it covers all those plot holes and makes people believe that it is an almost perfect movie, so it is of Men recognize that this movie cheated the world and almost fooled me. In conclusion Avengers Endgame is a very good movie lying, with a great final battle, and with many plot holes, I just want to say that I found it very difficult to put the rating on this movie, it was between 4 to 6, but then I decided that This is only a 6/10, even though deep down in my heart I know it deserves less.",5,4,6,24 September 2019
Toy Story 4," Totally unnecessary but ok it's a good movie.
","Toy story 4 was totally unnecessary, because toy story 3 had the perfect ending, a magic ending, but all right apparently for pixar there is nothing more magical than money, one of the biggest problems with this fourth part is that it feels like a epic adventure, something that it could have been taught in a short film, i mean if woody hadnt turned to the store nothing of the movie would have happened, and the movie introduces you to new characters and this time if you put aside those we already know. This movie is a little overated, with this i Â´m not saying that the movie is bad, i just say that toy story 4 has a 97/100 in rotten tomatoes, the movie is good yeah but it's not good enough to have those qualifications, let's be,honest of the 4 movies this is the worst, the only that stands out from its predecessors is in the incredible animation, something that i like very much is that the movie takes risk and lets Woody leave once it have finished his purpose, and his ending is good, great ending, I hope that this one be the last movie, in conclusion toy story 4 is a good movie with a mature plot, but nothing outstanding .",7,1,5,7 August 2019
Batman Begins," Batman is the best super hero of all
","Batman Begins is one of the best super heroe movies ever made, is this movie Nolan not only tells you the origin of this character,it also humanizes him. This movie is more the journey of a man's self-encounter than the origin of a super hero, for me Christian Bale is the best Batman, but unfortunately the movie is not perfect, it has problems like, the Bruce Wayne's parents decide to go down the worst alley they see or Alfred beats a super trained ninja with a simple blow of a golf club, but all right in conclusion the movie is great but not perfect.",8,2,2,7 August 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," The most spectacular mcu movie.
","Avengers Infinity war was the most watched movie in 2018, because let's be honest, everyone saw this movie, and apparently everyone liked me, personally, when I left the cinema I felt confused in the sense that I had to ask the question 'Did I like it?' The truth to answer this question I had to see it again, maybe not at the cinema, but I did it at home, I analyzed it and came to the conclusion that if I liked it, but that does not mean that I loved it, I simply prefer movies as the first of 'Avengers', 'Ironman' or even 'The Winter Soldier'. Well, if you're a marvel fan, before you explode in anger, I want to remind you that I'm not saying that the movie is bad, I'm just saying it's not the best. Why? It's simple, the movie is very complicated, such as that they could beat Thanos very easily, like cutting off his arm with the portals of Dr. Strange, or that Dr. Strange does the infinite cycle as he did with Doormamu, well I think it is written like this, but that does not matter, the point is that if Doormamu a million-year-old celestial being got bored, Thanos by logic, simple would also get bored and agree to its terms, but the movie is not very complicated and they make complex plans so that in the end one of them spoils him (Star-lord), or that the film is complicated more also with that sub-plot of Thor in search of a magical dwarf to make his ax, and the problem is here, at Thor Ragnarok we were taught that Thor is not the god of hammers, but that this is the god of thunder, therefore he does not need a weapon to defeat his enemies, but here the film is overlooked, and contradicts herself by telling us that Thor alone It is going to be able to defeat Thanos with that Ax, which, as I said, contradicts what they told us in Ragnarok, or that of the end that everyone vanishes, I wonder 'Am I supposed to get sad for them? The answer is no, because it is more than predictable that they would return, seriously the people who cry with it, make me sad. Now I'm going to talk about how good this movie has and I want to start by saying that it's just great to see all the mcu superheroes together in a movie, which I have to recognize the writers and directors that for a movie with so many characters did not not bad, to tell the truth unlike other marvel movies, this one has a good villain, that would be Thanos, that has an interesting story, and a justifiable reason, that if you analyze it logically the true villains of the movie specifically the avengers , to avoid the salvation of the universe, to tell the truth the battles are good, the action is entertaining, and maybe previously I said yes, it is very predictable that the characters that disappeared will come back, but if there were some that did die of Truth like Loki and Vision, I hope they do well and leave them dead. I dare to say that the best of this movie is its ending with the winning villain, something we had never seen in a marvel movie. Personally I would have liked more is that this would have been the last film of the mcu, nothing like an unexpected ending with the villain won and with half of the population 'dead', but I would only add something else at the end, to give an end to each character that survived, for example a scene that Tony Stark stays in the lost space forever, the heroes of the earth admitting that Thanos was right, or something like that I loved, because apart marvel was done doing the favor to close with a flourish, because the movies that have been released after this one are simply not good, 'Captain Marvel' is the typical original movie, with an annoying protagonist and the movie ends up being boring, Ant-Man and the Wasp It is more of the same, with a villain with silly motives, many things that lack meaning, excess of humor, the movie is very bad, Avengers Endgame is not bad, but neither stands out in any way, the hour of time is boring rid to, and you already talk about this movie in a separate review, and we get to the last movie that Marvel has taken out that it would be Spider-Man Away from home and this movie is bad, the plot is more than predictable, the villain has again a silly and repetitive motive, excess of humor, love is silly and forced, Spider-Man is a fool in this movie, please enlighten me and please tell me what this movie is good about, because everyone I know love that movie. Well back to the topic Infinity War is one of the great events in the history of superhero movies and I am not sure if it is correct to say of cinema in general, with great battles, with one or another thing that does not make much sense, but a good Villain, this movie earns its 7/10.",6,0,0,20 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One of the best movies that Tarantino had ever done.
","To tell you the truth, this is one of the films I most expected this year and being honest I was not disappointed, when I left the cinema, I left very satisfied. The movie tells you two stories at the same time, a fictional one by Rick and Cliff and another true one that would be Sharon Tate's, the movie plays with you teaching you how sweet and kind Sharon Tate is, making you believe that at the end of the movie she will be brutally murdered as in real life, but as we know it was not so, as in Inglorious Basterds, Tarantino changes the timeline, causing an event that never happened. Many people say that the movie could have been the same without the scenes of Sharon Tate and the truth is not true, since those scenes are what gives an excellent touch to the final scene in which Rick after saving his neighbor Unintentionally, he finally knows her in person, without those scenes the end would not have been so special. The film gives more importance to the characters than the plot, which is fine, because they are very good characters, since they have a well-developed personality, which makes them interesting, what I mean is that the movie is taken for the characters, therefore they make the plot more and more interesting, and in my opinion Cliff steals the movie, without a doubt he is one of the best characters that Tarantino has created. That apart from the fact that the environment of the film is very striking, this film is undoubtedly the most personal movie of Tarantino, it is like a love letter towards the cinema that he likes so much, the only thing I have to complain about It would be something like if there is an occasional filler scene and that the movie does not stop to explain why the killers of the end were there, well those who know the real story, understand why they are there, but those who do not know the story Real may feel somewhat confused, that is why I consider that the film can not have a 10/10. In conclusion Once upon a time in Hollywood it is for me the best movie of 2019, it is the movie that anyone tired of watching marvel in the cinema would like, with very well developed characters, an attractive environment, great performances, and that is why I consider this movie a very good 9/10.",9,9,14,5 September 2019
Aladdin," Everything youÃÂ´re waiting for.
","Aladdin is a family movie,its funny,the music is great,but in the begining of the movie is just very boring,and there are a lot of things that doesnÃÂ´t have sense,like:
how is posible that a poor man a thive,could be noirished and the villan of the movie Jafar had two chances two kills Aladin,and he didnÃÂ´t do it.And how is posible that almost in the end the princess wants to get married with Aladin if she just met him 3 days ago.IÃÂ´m just saying that,that doesnÃÂ´t have sense,well the point is that a lot of things in this movie doesnÃÂ´t have sense.
And the acting is horrible,except of course the Will SmithÃÂ´s acting.It could say that the best of the movie is Will Smith.In conclusion Aladin is a family movie as i said,if a family goes to the cinema to watched they probably gonna liked.
And in the tittle of this review i put everything youÃÂ´re waiting for,because it is evything youÃÂ´re waiting for, the movie doesnÃÂ´t have sorprises,when i went to see the movie,i said to myself 'Oh,well this movie is everything i was waiting for.",4,1,3,31 May 2019
The Dark Knight," One of the best super hero movies ever made.
","The dark knight It is considered by many to be one of the best movies in history and iÂ´m agree, i love this movie, Batman is my favorite super heroe, and Nolan in this second part brings us the best villain of all 'The Joker' and the performance of Heath ledger is incredibly good. In this movie Nolan understood the relationship between Batman and the Joker, itÂ´s so cool,I honestly i don't find much to complain about in this movie,the film has small failures, such as that the joker manages to stop a policeman to leave the cell, then an explosion happens and everyone dies, or passes out except the joker, or searches for bombs in all places except in the boat where people are. But I can really forgive that because I loved the movie.I have read that some critics criticize the final scene in which Batman blames himself for everything and they say that he is very forced or that he could have blamed another villain blah blah blah but seriously they think he would have seen Better if Batman had said something like: Gordon tell them it was the joker or any other criminal. For God's sake it's more cool that Batman makes a sacrifice and blames himself. This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen.",9,1,2,7 August 2019
Toy Story," Yeah Toy story:

Taken," A entertainig action film.
","'Taken' is a 2008 film, which was popular (the audience liked it a lot), which is in a nutshell that Liam Neeson who is a former CIA agent, will have to kill half a mob to save his daughter White's traffic. As the plot sounds and that is Liam Neeson, it is not surprising that it has caught people's attention. The visual direction is very good because the movie ends up being very entertaining, this is thanks to the well executed sequences of action, the performances are also very acceptable, but of course those of Neeson and Janssen, are the most outstanding. Another positive aspect of the film is that it can be said that he takes his time in the sense that there is no meaningless action in the first 5 minutes, although the film is not much he dedicates a little time to his characters, and That is very good, you know who is who and why things, you find out why their situation is like this, among other things, I liked it so much that it does not rush things so much, let's be honest that is worth recognizing from a movie of action. I think it is interesting the way in which the film briefly shows how white trafficking is, I am not saying that its representation is 100% realistic, but I dare to say that if it is a bit similar to reality, the film It teaches you that the majority of customers of that kind of thing are not lazy in the street, if they are not rich and often famous people. (Maybe that is one of the reasons why the film did not got good well reviews) Previously I said that the action scenes are well executed, but I did not say that they were very well executed, I mean that it can be said that to some extent the fight sequences are somewhat simple, an example of a very well executed sequence of action would be in 'John Wick' the way Keanu Reeves moves is incredible, you know he gave himself to the role, because I train Kung Fu literally, and thanks to that you believe it when he defeats everyone, while with Liam you see him 'Fight' and you say 'well it's just a movie'. Speaking of the bad for more positive aspects that it has is not saved from the negative aspects, although the film is well narrated, many things are very convenient, for example, that of the subject that says 'Good luck', that coincidentally he runs into it again by chance and casually says 'Good Luck' and despite the fact that people's voices change a little when they speak on the phone or microphone, Liam's character 'Brian' manages to recognize him because surely the scriptwriters they thought most would say 'ThatÂ´s awesome'. Instead of surprising you, the scene only ends up being convenient for the plot to progress, but since after that they reward you with an entertaining action scene. But well the rest is more convenience and Liam proving unrealistically that nobody could against him. In spite of all the good, it weighs on the bad. In conclusion 'Taken' is a very entertaining action movie, which explores in an acceptable way the subject of trafficking in white, with good sequences of action, an acceptable direction, acceptable performances, a good narration, with various plot conveniences, and things unrealistic, but in spite of that I dare to say that it is a classic for modern action cinema.",7,1,1,7 February 2020
Toy Story 2," A sequel that really works
","Toy story 2 is a second part that it really works, for me this is the best movie in the saga, because it didnt feels like a sequel, considering the fact that the movie handles mature issues, and add new characters but without even doing side to those we already knew, but the movie has the same problems as the fist one, but itÃÂ´s okay i can forgive that, thats why this movie deserves 9/10.",9,2,2,6 August 2019
Reservoir Dogs," A low budget, but quality movie.
","I dont care what do you think, but for me Quentin Tarantino is the best director in history,with this movie Quentin Tarantino show us his potential to write and direct movies, a great example of that is the like a virgin scene, in that scene you made the idea of how are the personalities of the characters and through which the movie progresses we meet the characters more through flashblacks and that's great. The movie is realistic,has logic and i realy like that,you understand why the characters do what they do.Something that i love about Tarantino is that he is not afraid to kill his characters, and thats so exciting,beacause with Tarantino you never know whos gonna live and whos gonna die. To be honest i don't find much to complain about the movie, I loved it.Reservoir Dogs is one of those movies that you don't see every day.",9,1,1,10 August 2019
The Godfather: Part III," The best trilogy ever.
","In most trilogies, the third part is bad or is the worst of the three, and let's be honest, this is no exception, of the three this is the worst, because the movie simply doesnÂ´t stand out in any way,the only good performances in this movie are those of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, the others are passable,well some because the performance of Sofia Copola is horrible. Well maybe iÂ´m talking as if the movie didnÂ´t like me, and thatÂ´s not the case, i like this movie because Michael tries to fix his past mistakes with the help of the Catholic Church that's something realistic in a way, but does the movie sometimes have meaningless lacks like someone can explain to me why they want to kill the Pope?With this i mean the movie doesn't bother explaining these things to you. What if the movie has the best end of the three parts, an emotional ending that reminds us of this path we traveled together in these movies, giving an end to the best trilogy in history.",7,2,3,8 August 2019
Joker," A good story with a complex character.
","Over time we have had many versions of the Joker, that of Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, and that of Joaquin Phoenix, normally many ask the question of which of these is the best, that is a difficult question to answer since the Joker is a very complex character, I mean each of these Jokers works in its own adaptation. The film is simply above the average of the current Super-Heroes movies, for example this one does not have forced references and you could say that it has moments in which the film can make you laugh, but unlike other movies of This genre, these are not silly jokes. As I said this is different, this is not the typical story of a man who has natural skills, a villain to beat who wants to destroy the world, and that in the end he conquers it without any consequence, in fact it does not even feel from the Super Heroes genre, it's more of a madness exploration drama, because that's exactly what the Joker movie does, it teaches you how a man can transform into the Joker, it teaches you how madness leads you to do Many unimaginable things. For me the most realistic and more complex adaptation of the Joker would be this, without a doubt that of Ledger was very good, but Leger has more to be a former war veteran who wants to make chaos because there is a man in disguise playing the hero who a psychopath, however in this new version, this time Batman did not believe the Joker, this time it was the city who created it, which is more interesting because it is something never seen before (Well at least in a film of this genre ). I loved the environment of Gotham City, it is quite dark at the same time as credible, and it is perfect for the film, the color palettes of the film is perfect for each scene of this film, it feels that everything combines, and that everything is instead. That is why my favorite scene would be the first one, the colors combine perfectly, we see Arthur sitting painting, you understand that it is not that he is not happy, maybe he tries, but it is not, this you can easily understand because, while the It makes you smile forcefully, throw a tear, in a nutshell, this scene makes it clear to you how the movie will work and a raw story that probably does not have a happy ending, the best thing is that it tells you without any unique dialogue of the characters (except the radio). The character feels human, everything he does feels naturally, he doesn't feel forced or anything like that, something that I like and that I like very much personally is that the character evolves from being Artur Fleck to being the Joker, this change is You can tell when he murders his adoptive mother after learning that he cheated on many things, from there Arthur becomes the Joker, who honestly sees him as Joker is somehow the healthiest state we see, since that Arthur was a man who suffered abuse, he was hallucinating, and he really didn't know what to do with his life, as long as Joker could say he already knows who he is for the first time, he accepts himself as he is and has a clear goal. The hallucinations were very interesting, everything we saw in the movie just makes it clear that only two things were hallucinations, the rest is your decision whether it was real or not, words of the director. For me, everything starts to be a hallucination after Arthur stops taking his medications, since from here many things begin to happen that are conscientiously favorable to Arthur, for example, that he is invited to Murray's show, or that a complete revolution has been made thanks to him, I only say that if he could imagine a relationship with his neighbor, why couldn't he imagine a complete revolution in his favor? That's why the final scene would be the best in the movie, this is the one that makes you doubt if everything you saw is real, for example, generates questions like, how the hell did they catch him if he was next to a crowd? ? o Why is psychology coincidentally similar to that of the beginning? or also that this place is similar to what we saw almost at the beginning that the psychologist asked if he remembered why he was internship. The meaning of the film is what caused the most controversy, since this as in films like 'Taxi Driver', or 'Fight Club' among others can be misunderstood, as you may identify with what the characters say, if we live in an unfair society in which the rich get fat while the poor die of hunger, and that is why we have to make a revolution, and that is not what the film is transmitting to you, rather it could be something like you are not bad with others, do not treat others badly, or also what the movie wants to convey to you would really be something like what one of the background songs of this movie says that although others trample your dreams you don't have to let that depresses you, and that is the exact opposite of what Arthur did. I really do not find much to complain about this movie, I liked everything and if it has any error this will be justified with something like 'Remember that many things are hallucinating.' Even that doesn't really bother me. In conclusion Joker is a raw movie, which may make you feel uncomfortable, which is fine because it means that the movie is getting you emotions, which also means that you like the movie, this is a movie that explores its issues, with a great performance of Joaquin Phoenix worthy of an Oscar, with little action but with more than interesting moments, I hope they do not ruin it by taking a sequel, because he really does not need it, and if Black Panther an average movie does not stand out in nigun sense was nominated for Oscar, I donÃÂ´t see why this not, that is why the Joker earns its well deserved 9/10.",9,0,1,13 October 2019
Whiplash," I love J.K Simmons:
","Wiplash is a movie that was praised by critics, and iÂ´m agree, is a very good movie,and the J.K Simmons performeance is amazing, J.K Simmons is one of my favorite actors.The movie is about a young drummer, maybe this could sound boring,but is not,something that i like very much is that the movie is very realistic to some extent,give you the message that without pain there is no gain,and that is 100 porcent true.The main character suffer ,and you don't realize,because the movie doesn't victimize the characters and thatÂ´s something good. It's very different movie than the ones I've seen, I loved this movie,but the problem is that the movie sometimes is a little exaggerated, like when Andrew is crashed by a car and even though this bleeding is going to touch the concert. Look i donÂ´t have any trouble in which the movie has only two main characters, the problem is that they doesn't have much personality,we know that both like music and well thats it.In conclusion Whiplash it's an outstanding movie but it's not perfect",8,2,2,9 August 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," One of the best trilogys ever made.
","This movie is the epic conclusion of this incredible trilogy. For me a good ending is when everyone and everthing are put in their place and thatÃÂ´s exactly what the dark knight rises did,the movie puts batman to face the greatest threat of the trilogy, and the main them of the movie is to rise and thats what Batman needs to do,make the maximum sacrifice for his city,but well this is sounding like the movie is perfect and it is not,i mean when Batman left the dungeon and we saw all that was in the middle of the desert, I wonder: How did he get back to Gotham? or that when the bomb exploded they should have bothered to put the city in quarantine because of the radiation, and Batman simply couldnÃÂ´t have survived the bomb explosion and if he did, then the radiation should have killed him, but as I really like Batman and I have a lot of love for this trilogy, I will believe that Alfred didnÃÂ´t see Batman in that restaurant that everything was part of his imagination. Well, finally, Batman shows us once again that he is the best superhero of all.",8,2,3,7 August 2019
Toy Story 3," On of the best sagas ever made.
","Some people say that toy story 3 is the greatest animated movie ever made, yeah the movie is good, but let be realistics in not the best animated movie, it even the best movie of the toy story saga, the main problem are things like the charactes canÂ´t trust in Woody for the thousandth time, or like the moment when the toys are escaping for sunny side and one toy gets stuck in a certain place and that moment is just like 'Oh my God! Really?, and that's lazy on the part of the writers,
and the Spanish version of Buzz is very annoying, but well this thing starts look like i didnÂ´t like the movie and it is not like that, i really liked, because to be a third part is so good, and the movie give you the message that life has many changes and you have to adapt to them,and I dare to say that this movie has one of the best endings in the history of movies.
Toy story 3 is one of the best animated movies ever made, but it not the best.",8,1,1,7 August 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," One of the best action films evermade.
","0 minutes ago When I saw Kingsman for the first time I was surprised because I liked it a lot despite the fact that this is an action and spy movie, and let's say that the films of that genre are not very good, surprisingly this is the exception, the movie gives you make it clear with the first scene that this is going to have its own level of realism, which will be built through the film moving forward, to this I mean we see a 'serious' scene about agents who want to interrogate a terrorist , but you understand that it will not be completely serious because of the way in which the credits are introduced, then they give us a good introduction of characters where you understand who is who, which is good since many films do not take the time to know to his characters, but what I really want to talk about and most surprised me was the villain, apart from the fact that this is played by Samuel L. Jackson, this unlike many villains, if he has personality, not you In no time to spare on the screen, his motives are justifiable, simply if you see it from another point of view his plan was not so malicious, this was to eliminate part of humanity to start again and save us from extinction, what really bad in this was that he chose those who were going to be saved and let's say that's not very fair, but hey, the point is that he's a very good villain, and without a doubt the violence is just great, I mean is creative, I say When we have seen in a movie a scene like that of the church? The film is well executed in the sense that it explains something, but without wasting time, and something that I really like is Egsy is not the typical annoying character who wants to be good if because, or who wants to defeat the villain with all his strength to Although these are not even found, the film also has personal moments for the protagonists, for example we see how the relationship between father and son between Harry and Egsy is strengthened through the progress of the film, something that was very brave on the part of the movie is to have killed Harry at the moment, I say at the moment because we already know that in the two he is alive and blah, blah, blah, the point is that for us we were dead in that movie, it was something that I grab you without you see it coming, because it is not very common that in today's movies they kill one of the protagonists of the way in which this movie did it, which is another success for the film since this serves as inspiration to Eg s and to return to become a Kingsman and want to defeat Valentine, but as good as this movie is, it is not perfect, I say through which the movie progresses the characters have technological objects that are suitable for the plot, or that no matter how much training they put Eggsy in their preparation to become a Kingsman, we never really saw them teach him how to fight, I say that the movie has mistakes but this does not mean that it is all the good it has. In conclusion Kingsman is a creative, funny movie, with good characters, an unusual villain, great action scenes, with one or another mistake, that is why this movie earns its good merely 8/10.",8,2,2,13 September 2019

The Great Gatsby," With all the elements to be a great movie, not knowing how to use them the movie ends up failing.
","'The Great Gatsby' (2013) is a film based on the novel 'The Great Gatsby' written by F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1925, being honest I have not read the book, I do not know if it is very good or if even the film is better than this, but to tell you the truth I don't think so. When 'The Great Gatsby' was released, it did not have much popularity, many people simply did not attract much attention and if the film really does not attract much attention, you may turn to see it twice because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the cover, but that's it, I doubt that most who have not seen it yet see it. In a nutshell the movie is about a writer who remembers his past, how he met the great Gatsby, in New York 1920. With that, the movie starts with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) telling his past to a psychologist and here already We have a problem, this would be that, once you finish watching the movie, you realize that all that was totally unnecessary, it does not contribute anything to the plot, one believed that at some point this would stop narrating his life to continue with the plot in the present, but that never happens, Nick finishes narrating his past, then nothing really important happens and the movie ends, I say again that all that was unnecessary, it would have been better if Nick simply told the story without the need to use two time lines, and thanks to that the narrative ends up being not very good. But before continuing with the bad I would like to talk about the good, this would be that, although I said that the narration is not very good, I recognize that the way in which Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) are introduced is good , especially for the famous DiCaprio scene raising the glass. The 1920 rhythm music is very good, is used in a good way and does not feel so out of place. I also want to emphasize that photography is different, in the sense that it does not look very real but this does not necessarily have to be something bad, so let it be that it is different from the vast majority. The interpretations of DiCaprio, Mulligan and Bunchan are good, but especially that of Bunchan, it is clear to the naked eye that this was the one that gave more importance to his role. Do not mention Maguire because his interpretation of depressive alcoholic writer, fails in the sense that he has nothing left, but not everything is Tobey's fault, it is also the fault of the writers for not writing his character well according to his supposed personality, another problem with this is that Nick feels more like a spectator than someone who has an important role in the movie. The romance between Daisy and Gatsby feels somewhat flat because there is no background behind it, is that the movie only tells you 'They loved each other a lot because I say so', I think it would have been more interesting if they told how it was love relationship between these two through a few flashbacks, yes, yes, there are two flashbacks but they don't endorse anything I just mentioned that the movie does wrong, I mean, one is about Jordan Baker (Elizabeth Debicki) speaking about how he already knew Gatsby, explaining that he was Daisy's boyfriend and the other talks about how Daisy and Gatsby kissed, as they see there is no background, nowhere do they explain how Gatsby managed to conquer Daisy, if they make you understand that their relationship was great, but they do not explain why it was great, and that is also why the characters feel so flat, or heavy in the sense that most of them are conceited to the point that you do not feel empathy For none of them, for example, the scene of Gatsby's death is supposed to make you feel something, but it does not, I read that many give the film a lot of credit just because Gatsby dies, and if it is always worth recognizing when a movie kills its main character, but as long as this is executed in a good way and that is not the case of Gatsby, I will put it in a nutshell, his death feels a bit forced, because the way is totally ignored in which George Wilson (Jason Clarke) managed to enter the mansion, when we had previously seen all the safety of Gatsby, so that any guy between this way and kill him, I usually do not put much weight on this type of thing, but In this case I will make an exception because Gatsby's death is a very important event for the plot. Then it seems somewhat simple (FLOJA) the way in which the 'arcs' of the characters are closed, its end is no 'WOW', I appreciate the metaphors like the green light, which represented the dreams that Gatsby always wanted to achieve but I never succeed, but that is not going to save the movie from being what it is. In conclusion 'The Great Gatsby' is a film with an atmosphere that does not feel very 1920, with good performances, a good use of music, but with a structure of history not very good, and characters with whom you never really empathize , but at least I recognize the attempt of the film, to mix the drama with love, and to try to be a great production.",5,2,2,14 February 2020
