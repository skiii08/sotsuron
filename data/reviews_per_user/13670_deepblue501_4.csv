It," Just an illogical sequence of supposedly scary moments
","This movie tries to deal with so many items, it ends up being an illogical mess. Whilst the first scene starts out pretty good, soon the movie derails into a strange mixture between an 80's kids movie, drama and horror. In addition 'IT' tries to deal with issues such as friendship, sexual harassment, bullying and...oh yeah, there's also a scary clown as a bonus. The movie lacks a clear motive and story line and basically fails on all of above counts. The horror which is haphazardly thrown in between other types of storytelling is not even truly scary as it is mostly quite ridiculous. IT does not manage to find balance on any front: it does not know whether it's a drama, comedy or horror, it does not know whether it's intended for adults or children and it does not know how to edit all these scenes together. The scenario is a random succession of scenes which are vaguely connected. I don't feel like writing much about this highly overrated movie. Simply speaking, a boring and uninspired mess.",3,2,3,13 November 2017
Darkest Hour," An average biopic that never really takes off
","Apart from the obvious falsification of history (with the Tube ride being complete fabrication) this movie never really gets going. The political battles 'behind the scenes' (apart from also being historically untrue) never really captured my attention. Yes, this is quite a good character study, but the movie is slow and not propelled forward with sufficient drama and plot. It remains on a quite superficial level of political debates, a bit of Oldman showing off his skills and that's really it. Very little is said about the man himself, about his depression even about his family and wife. All characters surrounding Churchill are flat. And even if we focus on arguably the best aspect of the movie, which is Oldman's interpretation of Churchill, I have to confess that I didn't like it as much as many others. Oldman has a tendency to portray Churchill as an old man with a slow rhythm of speech, a voice sounding like a man close to his grave, weighing every word and honestly, this becomes irritating after an hour or so. In fact, I don't believe it is even particularly true to the original - Churchill was quite a vigorous man in spite of his age. The cinematography is sufficient but not spectacular. The music likewise. Nothing really stands out in this movie. It's not bad, but it is a far cry from a movie that should win an Oscar. Average at best.",5,2,4,7 October 2018
Cold War," Eye candy with no narrative or character development
","Obviously taking its inspiration from Fellini, the story of two lovers in cold war Poland and 'western' France is one that totally did not grip me. Sure, the photography is great & the acting is OK (though not great) but that's about it. Otherwise this is a story with no surprising twists, no real plot, no secondary themes. It's empty.The scenario is boring and revolves around one single thing: the love of the two protagonists. That's it. Nothing else. There's very little about the political aspects of those times (just some details regarding censorship and the Polish communist government trying to create propaganda) and furthermore some twists are completely unbelievable (after many years of separation she suddenly finds him in an obscure bar in Paris?). Also, the eternal love, that the movie is supposedly about, is not built up at all, but rather a given at a certain point in time. Also, folk music and dance roughly amount to 1/4th of this anyway short movie (80 or so minutes). The dialogues are cringeworthy at best. In short, there's not much to like here, in my opinion.It's hard to get into the skin of the two protagonists and their love. As said, it's not built up, there's hardly any character development. The two stay the same for 20 odd years and that is basically all the movie offers. No secondary characters, no other twists, no other deeper meaning.I am boggled by how this movie (and also Pawlikowski's other tragically bad but somehow critically acclaimed movie 'Ida') received so much positive press. For me there's nothing in this movie except eye candy. Perhaps all the critics have suddenly fallen in love with Pawlikowski and the type of movies that have no message, no meaning and just superficial splendor. Maybe it's the black and white thing? I don't get it.Seriously flawed scenario with very little surprising elements. In short, simply a boring movie with unbelievable and uninteresting characters and theme. It might be even worse than 'Ida'. How this could have been nominated for an Oscar is completely beyond me.",4,2,4,16 February 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Dumb and overrated
","Whereas Will Ferell can be funny at times, he completely misses the point in this absolutely below average comedy. Even the cameo appearances of respected actors like Tim Robbins or Ben Stiller cannot change what this movie really is: a dumb waste of time and a surprising lack of funny moments for a comedy.The idea is that Ron Burgandy (Will Ferell), an ego-maniac who thinks he is a gift to all women, gets competition as the anchorman of a San Diego local news station. The competition is his lover, the charming Christina Applegate. Of course this starts a 'hilarious' sequence of events. To be honest, I do not even want to write a review for this movie. I cannot understand why some (even expert websites) call this a defining comedy or an instant classic. The only person out of the three cronies that Will Ferell hangs out with, who is even remotely funny is Steve Carell who plays the total, but sweet idiot Brick. This movie is not funny, so dumb that it borders on offensive and just a complete waste of time. I would even recommend watching an action movie instead of this one...which means a lot as I hate action movies...!",2,3,5,8 May 2017
