United 93," Cinematic Catharsis
","Put your politics aside and see this film for what it is, an excellent example of film-making. Perhaps the best in recent memory. Gripping, thrilling, heart-wrenching. The film will have you glued to your seat. It makes you relive the horror and emotions of the human tragedy we all lived through 5 years ago. Some would ask, why bother? Is it too soon? Experiencing the events of that day once again reminds us of why we must at all costs defend ourselves against this cancer that's infected our lives. I don't care about conspiracies or anyone's agenda, the reality is this DID happen and will happen again if we are not vigilant. And for you Bush haters out there, he's not portrayed in the best light since no one at NORAD could find him or the VP for orders to shoot down hijacked aircraft. Greengrass is a master of the art! Not to be missed.",10,3,8,2 May 2006
