The Equalizer," Pleasantly Surprised...Spoilers
","First, let me just say that I was a big time fan of the television version of The Equalizer in the 80s but the only similarity is that the characters share the same name.Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, a super organized and friendly loner that works in what appears to be a Home Depot type of store. His past, which is clearly working as a CIA operative who was believed killed, haunts him so he can't sleeps and spends his evening at a local coffee shop, reading and socializing with a very young attractive prostitute, Teri, played by Chloe Graze Moretz.After Teri is assaulted and hospitalized by her pimp, played by David Meunier - Justified fans will recognize him, McCall proceeds to go on a killing rampage which starts a war with a powerful Russian king pin.The story then follows a by the numbers action/kill fest that leads pretty much where you expect to go but what makes it work are excellent performances by everyone in the cast and the tight story telling. There is no chaff in this film and it does not pretend to be anything than what it is, a great way to spend a couple of hour being entertained and not thinking. If you are not a 'fan' of pretty graphic violence you may want to avoid this one.",7,0,1,26 May 2015
Terminator Salvation," Actually kind of liked it....
","I was really excited to see this movie in the theater after seeing the previews and learning Christian Bale was on board but after all the Luke warm reviews I decided to hold off until it made it's way to cable.I honestly have to admit that I kind of liked the film. First, in the interest of full disclosure, I am a fan of the first two Terminator films I was never obsessed with them and so I didn't go into this film looking for it to recapture the feel of the first two. I was just looking for an entertaining action film with decent acting and I felt it delivered on both of these levels.As a side note, I have to begrudgingly admit that Sam Worthington was perfectly cast in his role. I am not saying that he justifies all of the hype he is receiving but I was much more impressed with his role in this film than I was by his role in Avatar.",7,2,4,2 May 2010
