The Lobster," An autistic look at love and society's expectations
","An outrageous, simple, horrifying, captivating, and nuanced-yet-not film.It plays out like a world full of autistic people. Simple and awkward conversations, which are more statements and no frills. Poorly expressed and understood emotions. Discomfort and difficulty in unexpected and changing situations.It feels kind of like a play, but I guess the robotic behaviour and acting is part of the black and white world presented and how humans behave and think.The arbitrary and objective treatment of others and of relationships. A utilitarian approach to coupling (which seems odd because children are 'assigned' to couples, one wonders how procreation happens and why there are spare children around). Woeful misunderstanding of the nuance of real relationships and utilitarianism... but it provides a ridiculous look into the isolation of life and the pursuit of relationships to provide a reason for being.This really was not worthy of such low ratings by some reviewers, but it is definitely not an 'easy' film to watch, because the behaviour of the characters is very stiff and forced...If anything, I think this film is more of a serious look at autistic thinking and behaviour, than of humanity's pursuit of coupling relationships and a 'cost benefit'/utilitarian analysis of actions.This film will leave you with more to think about than to feel about. It's difficult to empathise with such robotic characters, but I think instead it requires a deeper understanding and appreciation of these people and the world they live in to really try to react appropriately...Do I feel sorry for these people, or pleased that life is so simplistic? Some of these single people actually look forward to their lives as transformed animals. The certainty of expectations and the simplicity of relationships must be comforting for them, eg: do we both have a limp, or do we both have similar hair?I think this film is excellent, whatever the case. It is extremely novel, by premise and delivery, and really gave me a lot to think about. The locations and sets/props were used very well and felt right for this film. There are some horrifying elements to the film, but it is not meant to be gory (save for a few scenes that show blood and/or death (human and animal), but not extreme in delivery) or frightening.Violence was used well, with restraint, and I think presented the story well and added a lot.Watch this film, and push through the almost theatrical acting. I believe you will be rewarded by your experience.",7,0,2,3 December 2018
The Adjustment Bureau," Good Idea, Poorly Conceived
","This film really was a waste of my time.The premise was interesting, but the execution was so boring. Nothing really happened in this film except some chasing, and some talking. How the hell can such a piece of garbage be rated so highly? Is it because Matt Damon is in it?I really don't know what the point of this film was, and I just finished watching it. Something to do with magic interference in the world, or something. You're left wondering what the hell is going on.Watch this film if you're bored and don't mind wasting 1 1/2-hours of your time on nothing much.--- Edit: I just have to say, how the fudge did this pile of turd cost $50m to make?! Also, why is this rated so highly? I've seen some crap films in my time, but at least the scripts usually have something interesting in them somewhere.This film is devoid of plot twists, intrigue, and a reason to keep you watching... except to see if anything happens, which it doesn't.",2,2,4,15 June 2011
