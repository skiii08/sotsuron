50 First Dates," Great movie!
","If you have read any of my other comments, you know by now that when I watch a movie, I am in it for a certain emotion. When I watch an action movie, I want to be on the edge of my seat all the way through. When I watch a sensual movie I want to be ready to jump my husband's bones at the end. This was truly a great romantic comedy. The comedic parts were hilarious- I was laughing the whole way through. The romance was awesome. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore really have great chemistry. I felt them the whole way through. The penguin and the old guy stole the show. This is not a chick flick, though. The guys will enjoy it too! This is a movie that I suggest you own!",8,0,0,5 June 2005
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," I can't get enough
","This is truly a movie I can't get enough of. I own it, yet every time it comes on Showtime, I have to watch it still. Kate Hudson is truly her mother's daughter. She is a great comedic actress. I really think she is my favorite movie actress. Her chemistry with Matthew is great. I wish they would get together again because they play really well opposite each other. Tony and Thayer really steal the comedic scenes though. Their non-chalant comments are so sarcastic it makes them even funnier. I should say, though - I think this movie is more for women than men. Only a woman could appreciate all her tactics to drive him away.",8,0,0,5 June 2005
