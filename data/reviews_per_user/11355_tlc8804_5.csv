Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Stinking pile of bear scat
","This movie was just downright awful. I like to think that I can be entertained by no brainer humor ( I sat through Kung Pow twice), and seeing new and outrageous racist humor is funny to me too. Both of which are in abundance here, but none of it is very good. Most of the humor, especially the anti semitic, seemed forced and really not that original. THe Blair witch project segment was pretty creative however, and at the very least Cohen sells his performance to the utmost, never letting himself in on the joke. Azamat also had a hidden depth to himself that he was never allowed as an actor to explore. With just a bit more effort, real development and emotion could have gone into these characters. The sad fact is that they are stereotypes of something that doesn't even exist, and any humor seen by them is IMO completely overridedby the naked wrestling scene. Whatever redeeming qualities the film had were just killed by that... Cold War humor just isn't funny anymore, nor is the characterization of Russian satellites as backwards and morally corrupt. More disturbing yet is the behavior of some of the victims of the movie. While the frat boys are forgivable, the rodeo owner and several others not featured in the movie show us that we still have a lot of problems as a nation. I'm also interested to see how the many lawsuits are going to turn out.",4,6,13,20 November 2006
Dumb and Dumber," Immortally the best comedy ever made
","Dumb and Dumber is, and always shall be, the funniest movie on the face of the earth, and any other planet who's surface it might grace. From the opening credits, with everything misspelled to the riotously ridiculous theme song, 'Boomshakalaka', to the final frame of Jim Carrey's and Jeff Daniels's retarded backsides, this movie inspires awe, wonder, and tears of laughter and of the pain from falling out of whatever you might have been sitting in. Nearly every piece of dialog in the entire movie has comedic intent, and it all works. From Lloyd's very first conversation, 'My that's a lovely accent, New Jersey?' 'Austria' 'Austria! Well, good day mate, let's put another shrimp on the barbie!' to the last sentimental yet stupid line of the movie, brilliance unlike anything ever seen before is shown in the writing. Every actor plays their role perfectly. The good guys are unrealistically dumb, but the bad guys are perfect. They're not over the top and they're just bad enough to make us know they're the enemy, but we never get swept up in what they're doing. This movie is all about the 2 man wrecking ball of Harry and Lloyd. I am confident this thing will endure beyond any other movie, and on my dying day of April 4th, 2050, I will watch this movie and laugh my butt off one last time before going to the white light. It's that good. If you have not seen this movie at least 5 times, watch it again for all our sakes, and catch the last 30 jokes you missed in the first four viewings, due to you laughing over them. 10 out of 10",10,1,2,24 August 2006
From Dusk Till Dawn," Best movie ever
","From Dusk Till Dawn is my favorite movie ever. I think that it contains all the elements of a fun, exciting and re watchable movie.The acting is my favorite part of the movie. Clooney is so bad an actor that he's fun to watch. He actually is unable to say lines in the script, and they leave the bad takes in the final cut of the movie. He also has some very memorable and campy lines, such as 'Okay ramblers, let's get rambling', 'okay hard drinkers, lets drink hard, I'm buying' and of course, 'Okay Vampire Killers, lets kill some f****in' vampires!' Tarantino was much better an actor, and his character had many dimension which made him worth watching. Keitel was awesome as always, deeply philosophical and really bringing life to his character, and all the others played their bit parts with enthusiasm and humor.The plot is pretty bizarre, but it just works. The first part deals with the escape of two outlaw brothers. They killed a lot of people and are looking to escape to Mexico, and kidnap Keitel and his family to smuggle them over the border. They arrive at the rendez-vous point, the titty twister bar, and wait for the arrival of Carlos, their escort. Pretty soon all hell breaks loose and the survivors band together to fight a horde of vampires who have been running this bar.The gruesome violence, which is even more graphic in the DVD is just awesome and fun to watch. Homages are paid to many great movies, like the wild bunch, and the special effects are just spectacular. The dialog from the survivors is just priceless, from when they discuss how to kill vampires to when The Hammer tells his Nam flashback, to the stunning finale and final goodbyes.I cannot think of a more bizarre, fun, and deep popcorn thriller. Highly recommended to any fan of vampires, action, Tarantino, or clooney's god awful acting (which works for the movie). 10 out of 10",10,1,2,24 August 2006
Grindhouse," What a train wreck..
","I've been looking forward to seeing Grindhouse since I first heard about it. From Dusk Til Dawn is my all time favorite movie, and that was the earliest and still best collaboration between directors Tarantino and Rodriguez. I was expecting something mind blowing, something so original that it would knock me flat on my ass, but overall, Grindhouse didn't do that for me.I will say, the fake trailers are brilliant, and I am completely going to buy Machete the day it hits DVD, and the others were hiliarious and dead on satires of their respective genres. What was killing me throughout this whole experience, however, was the nearly ruined picture quality, and the completely ruined sound quality. Now before everyone jumps down my throat, I know this is all an homage to the good old days back in the 70's where people sat through 3 hours of cheesy popcorn flicks, put up with sticky seats, damaged prints, and unsavory management. I don't really feel the need to relive that. We've evolved beyond it, I suggest we all enjoy that fact. What I did want to see, was two great, cheesy action movies with the trademark brilliant dialog and spot on casting that I've come to expect from my two favorite directors. If I can't understand half the words, what's the fun in that? Given the fact that Planet Terror was relatively dialog and story intensive, the indecipherable sound didn't help much. I enjoyed that movie as a whole, but once again, the missing reel... Sure it sounds like a good idea as a whole, but people really must be mindless idiots to say that made the movie better. I'll tell you what, if I paid to go see puss spewing zombies get blown away by a stripper with an M16 for a leg, I expect a little bit of a pay off in the way of a storyline. They just discarded all of that, and I'm left with one still in the chamber. On a positive note, all the casting was great including El Wray, Cherry, and Michael Biehn's re emergence after 23 years fighting Terminators in the shadows. I also love the references to previous films, which is just a fun little addition that makes the movies better.As for Death Proof, it makes me really sad to say that I was very disappointed. I've seen every movie Tarantino has made at least 3 times, and I loved each one, being just different enough from the last to make them completely unique and re watchable. Death Proof is still a great concept, but the delivery was just 3 feet off the mark, in my opinion. It may just be me, but watching 4 girls engage in frivolous conversation is about as entertaining as being constipated on a public toilet. The first sequence with Kurt Russel was just awesome, and there's no denying that. However, lag time in the middle with more jabber by Tarantino's trademark sassy black woman dragged down my buzz big time. The climax, while at time's thrilling, just completely lost it for me, and for the sake of argument, I'll chalk that up to my inability to look past reallllly big plot holes, raise my fist high in the air and say 'girl power!' I'm sure more than a few people liked the ending, so I'll leave it alone. What made me really sad was that the sound quality in this movie was just absolutely perfect, when I would soooo very much preferred to not hear the dialog, whereas in Planet Terror I want those precious words to be loud and clear. AND again with the missing reel. Now I'm fully loaded with no where to shoot. Where are those hot Greek babysitters when you need them? Overall, this thing is worth seeing. Especially if someone else pays. The hilarious trailers, the above average action scenes, and at times downright disturbing scenes of gore will do well to placate the lowest among us. However, those of us looking for a real MOVIE experience, rather than a movie-going experience complete with artificial and IMO detrimental ambiance, might feel hindered and ultimately disappointed.P.S. Nicolas Cage has totally redeemed himself for Ghost Rider. Putz.",7,22,35,8 April 2007
Casino Royale," A well made answer to the Brosnan Era Bond
","The idea of James Bond as a character must change with the coming of each new generation, and also of each new actor who portrays him. While the role was blessed with Sean Connery as the penultimate and timeless Bond, so too was each new generation graced with a unique and talented man to fill those formidable shoes.Such a man is found in Daniel Craig. He is in many ways the antithesis to Pierce Brosnan's ultra suave and sarcastic Bond. He is built like a true human weapon, with the muscles and agility to match. He is brutal, able to take down enemies not only with stealth and cunning, but with sheer nerve and incredible stamina. The opening foot chase scene is not to be missed.This film truly shows the journey of Bond, of what makes him the man we know. No other film is so ambitious as to make any mark of progress in the character. When Connery arrived on the scene he was a man fully set in his ways, with none of the boisterous swagger of youth, but only the air of confidence one has when he has perfected his art. All that is Bond was not written in the first 2 hours of this film, but was forged in gunfire and blood. Even the clothes show the journey. From the off the rack 2 pieces and Hawaiian prints in the first section to the classic tailored tuxedo and the immaculate 3 piece at the the conclusion, we see where clothes truly make the man.Back too is the Bond villain of old, one who is menacing and formidable in his way, but not some hackneyed cookie cutter bent on world domination. LeChiffre is a perfect mix of the old and the new. He is vastly intelligent and calculating, but not strong willed, which is what gives Bond the edge he needs to win. Even the character quirk of an eye weeping blood is just fantastic. That is a villain. Who else WEEPS blood? Also the steadily increasing efficiency of Bond's methods are a sight to behold, we see them come full circle in the span of the film.Vesper Lynd to is an underrated performance. She matches up to Bond's abilities and shows emotional range never before witnessed in a Bond movie, particularly dwarfing Halle Berry's American agent in Die Another Day. She belongs among the great actresses to play such a role, and was instrumental in forging our Bond, who I am excited to see take on the new form of SMERSH in the coming sequels.Overall Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond for our generation, and hopefully will prove to hold his own in the timeless tradition of Connery and Dalton, and he will continue this franchise in the proper direction. Here's hoping the sequels stay equally faithful to good storytelling and real stunts, not that CGI nonsense that bloated the Brosna era.8 Out of 10, not a ten because they're going to make me wait years to see another installment!",8,1,3,20 November 2006
