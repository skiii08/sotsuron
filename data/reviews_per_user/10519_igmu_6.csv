Minority Report," OK for a rainy afternoon
","Definitely not one of the best sci-fi films. Apart from the basic premise it was extremely derivative - if it had included aliens you could have laid money on them being 'little green men'. It has all of the trademark Spielberg traits, including an enormous dose of sentimental schmaltz and appalling sound. Why is it that he thinks that we should have to struggle to make out what the characters are saying?That said it wasn't a 'bad' film; just clichÃ©d with some glaring plot holes and a 'hidden' villain who was identifiable in the first ten minutes. Tom Cruise didn't do too badly with the part, but then he is at his best with vapid 'techie' action heroes. Think 'Mission Impossible' - it's the same character.Don't bother paying money to see this - it's only worth watching on the TV when it's free. 5/10.",5,10,16,29 December 2005
Cold Mountain," Definitely worth a look.
","I haven't seen this film for about a year, but something brought it to mind. I decided to browse the comments here and am most surprised, especially by some of the negative ones.Two of the most laughable are that a) Jude Law's acting performance was very wooden and b) there are two many non-American actors in the film.a) Jude Law IS one of the most wooden actors ever, and in my view is normally dreadful in all that he does. However, in this film his character, Inman, is one of the most dull individuals ever realised on film, and Law is ideally cast as the shy, boring, monosyllabic carpenter. He fitted the role perfectly.b) What the critics who moan about the use of non-American actors forget is that the USA is a land of immigrants, and that the likelihood of people speaking with a not quite perfect 'southern' accent was very high in the melting pot of the 19th century. Granted, I don't suppose that there were too many Australian immigrants ;), but that shouldn't be held against Ms Kidman who does a fine job with most parts that she takes on.The film itself? It is not the greatest thing since sliced bread that some people believe, neither is it the boring rubbish described by others. I found it an engrossing story that, although episodic, held my attention for the whole two and a half hours. The story was well told and visually it looked good; the only reservation I have is that of the character played by Ray Winstone, which grated somewhat.Overall, well worth seeing. 8/10.",8,2,3,18 January 2006
Jarhead," 'Full Metal Jacket' for the 90s? I don't think so.
","The parallels are obvious for all to see, but especially in the obscenity-bawling drill sergeant. However, where FMJ tried to tell us that 'war is hell' and that it happens to ordinary people, Jarhead merely informs us that, never mind the story, this is a boring film.I think that a good film could have been made from this book, a film that would really have shown that life in the military, even in a war zone, isn't always about explosions and death. Instead, Mendes treats us to a bunch of - you guessed it - diametrically opposed unsympathetic stereotypes that we neither care for or about. There's the usual good wholesome boy, the geek, the retarded redneck, the one with the shadowy past (he should have joined the Foreign Legion!), the professional, the immigrant, etc, none of whom are distinguishable from each other in the paucity of their character development. Equally lacking is any indication of just what these characters are doing in the USMC in the first place. The excuse for having such a disparate bunch of backgrounds in Vietnam films is conscription. Just why are these guys there? We're never told. All we are left with is the impression, that seems common from films about the US military, that the young American soldier is, without exception, a mentally unstable screaming moron with no professionalism whatsoever. Personally, I don't believe that is true, but that is how the filmmakers portray it.So, leaving the cast out of the film (Gyllenhaal was good, but then he didn't really have to stretch himself), all we are left with are some pretty camera shots of sunset in the desert.This purported to be a film about the 'other side' of war, the boring side. Instead we just get a boring film. Unless you were actually there I wouldn't bother with this at all; as a piece of film entertainment it's worthless.",4,0,1,1 June 2007
1917," I gave it 5 stars purely for the cinematography...
","...but talk about the Emperor's New Clothes.
It was on the same level as the recent Dunkirk; looked good but absolutely style over substance. It was WW1 for the videogame generation but without the gore.
Episodic; empty landscapes; implausible behaviour and actions from all involved.
Plus if you want me to be nitpicky... church bells ringing the hour in a destroyed and inferno town; too many occasional black faces (sorry guys but even in WW2 it didn't happen like that); too many fat soldiers (Daniel Mays, anyone); too many Star Wars Stormtroopers dressed up as Germans (oh wait, perhaps it was their ancestors, errmm descendants) and the Cruel and Evil Hun Pilot! (see Flyboys). Plus a plotline that dragged out Mel Gibson's one and only great performance - in Gallipoli - into a two-hour plod. And what was Mark Strong's warning 'make sure you get witnesses' about. It had absolutely no bearing on the film whatsoever.
Unlike Saving Private Ryan or the original Dunkirk, or even Gallipoli, I won't be watching this again. Wish we'd have gone to see Jojo Rabbit instead.",5,6,16,13 January 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Entertaining but not brilliant.
","This film starts off being very confusing, but if you stick with it it does become clearer. Kate Winslet and Kirsten Dunst give good performances, Tom Wilkinson is hardly used and almost on autopilot, and Jim Carrey? The jury's out, but not terrible, merely average I think.The ending was pretty lame; it was rather obvious from the start what was going to happen, just to what degree.Definitely not worthy of the IMDb top 50, but also definitely worthy of a look. Rent the DVD and make your own mind up. I've now run out of things to say about it, that's all the inspiration that it gave me. Is it ten lines yet?",7,0,3,17 May 2007
The Matrix Reloaded," Drivel
","I don't give up on many films but this was one of them. Most of what I want to say has already been written but -the rave scene (hideous) -Zion (boring) -Morpheus (pretentious, dull crappy speeches) -the fight with the Smiths (so obviously CGI) -the fight on the truck (boring) -any amount of irrelevant and unexplained characters -overuse of slo-mo (again and again and again) -all this is a cinema release of a computer gameplus loads more, are enough reasons never to go near this film again. The Matrix was OK and made me want to see this. I so wish it hadn't. Avoid like the plague.",1,2,4,29 January 2006
