Hereditary," HORRIBLE
","I can not believe the false positive reviews. The movie is slow & it is more creepy than scary. I fell asleep in this movie, twice. There is a huge buildup to a absolute let down. No one walking out of the theater liked it. Please save your money. I give it one star for the cinematography.",1,281,566,9 June 2018
