Requiem for a Dream," Okay Shmokay... Perfect Blue Ripoff
",It was ok... once scene in the movie was an exact rip-off from a movie called Perfect Blue.Overall... the cinematography was good... some parts they just wanted to shock you.I really didn't care for the characters... they deserved what they got.Payce!!,Null,0,1,3 December 2001
Memento," Hole in Plot
","SPOILER ALERTHow did Lenny know how to get to the bar where Natalie worked??  Yes, he received the coaster from Teddy, but that was AFTER the bar incident in front of Natalie's house inside the jaguar car.If the movie was TRULY running backwards, Lenny should have been in the bar FIRST, before Lenny received the coaster from Teddy telling him to meet Natalie in the Jag.So the movie did not run backwards throughout.**Remember Penelope**",Null,1,2,31 May 2001
The Breakfast Club," Claire is a Fat girl's name.
","Great Movie...Have you ever noticed the character's clothes in this movie??  They all start out wearing alot of bulky layers in the beginning of the movie... symbolizing the 'layers' they put on, protecting them from the messed-up world.  As the movie progresses... and the characters start to open up to each other, they begin to shed the layers of clothing that they have on.   
Claire is a fat girl's name.Thank you and have a nice day.",Null,0,1,10 November 2001
