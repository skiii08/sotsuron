Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I Lika!!!!!!! High Fiva!!!!!
","Jagshamesh!!! I wish i could give this movie a 1,000,000 rating on IMDb. This movie is FUNNY, OFFENSIVE, SATIRICAL, Poignant, ABSURD, & Hilarious!!!! Sacha Baron Cohen of Ali G fame has gone out and made 'reality movie'. I don't want to give out any spoilers, as I stayed away from them for many months before this epic comedy came out in theaters, but suffice to say you will be SHOCKED by Borat.At the screening I attended, parents (you idiots) brought their 8-9 year olds to the the flick. This is not a movie for kids, nor is it a movie for those who don't understand satire. Sure, there were a few chuckles during the toilet humor (mostly by the dunderheads who did not really understand Borat) but the real gut-inducing laughter came when Borat did or said something politically insensitive/incorrect. I noticed, the people who did not laugh during these parts, were most probably at the screening due to the all the hype the flick generated pre-release. Sacha thanks them for filling his pockets with $$$$ though.I'll have to re-watch this comedic gem again (multiple times) because at times the laughter was too much and I could not hear all the subtle jokes by Borat.The two major highlights of the movie are the wrestling match with Azamat and the dinner with the southern socialite. Get ready to have aching stomachs after those two scenes.I cannot wait until Sacha Baron Cohen makes the follow up the Borat, Bruno. Another one of his creations, that tests the morality of Americans and their so called democratic and freedom of speech values. I'm certain the Bruno movie will have less toilet humor and the Dunderheads will keep their kids at home.Only watch this movie if you value intellectual satirical comedy. Otherwise stick with garbage like Wedding Crashers.ChinKoee!",10,6,19,5 November 2006
Se7en," Remarkably disturbing and dark
","This movie made the seven deadly sins famous. Before this film, much of the mainstream audience could not even name one deadly sin.
This movie creates a great atmosphere, with a soundtrack that boasts the impending dread and doom in the both the storyline and the lives of the characters.  I thought this is one of Brad Pitts greatest roles, along with Seven Years in Tibet.The last ten minutes of the film are the greatest in cinematic history, IMHO.  The end is totally mind blowing but adds greatly to give a satisfying end to the story.Watch this movie on a rainy night with a good surrond sound system! Some scenes will be etched in your memory for a long time.  I still cant forget the murder dealing with sloth and gluttony.",9,0,0,10 November 2002
Memento," Mind bending
","This movie will definitely turn your world upside down.  Hard to follow at first, but after about 10 minutes you get used to the story running backwards.  It is a crime that this movie did not get many more Oscar nominations including one for Guy Pearce.  But I am sure this film will not be forgotten in the years to come similar to other movies such as Fight Club and The Insider.  Truly need to watch this movie more than once to enjoy it!",10,2,4,2 September 2002
Alien: Resurrection," Horrible!!!!!!!
","What a disgrace this movie is to all ripley fans.  The first one was a tense masterpiece.  The second by james cameron was an all out action fest with a great score.  The third one was watchable because it showcased the david fincher dark flair.  The fourth one is pathetic. Who is this director? Why is midget wynona ryder in an action movie? Why does Ripley want to cuddle with the alien?  Piece of crap, but any fan of the series will check it out anyways.  Be forewarned that it is absolutely the worst of the series!",1,29,54,30 July 2002
Chak de! India," A surprisingly effective sports flick
","I did not know much about this film before watching it a few days ago. I try to watch SRK films mainly because they are usually well made and I grew up watching his flicks thru the 90's.So this film performance by SRK is on par with one of his best performances from Swades. It is an understated performance and shows that the man can be a very good 'actor' when the role is suitable. Another first for SRK was there was no heroine in the film for him to sing songs to. I was quite surprised that the producers decided to put artistic merit over sticking out of place songs thru out the film.The performances by all of the girls playing on the team were effective. Although the outcome is predictable, it is still an exciting finish to the movie and should stand as one of the best sports movies to come out of India since Lagaan.Here is hoping that the Indian film industry begins to take notice that unique cinema can still reap huge financial benefits while enlightening the audience.And SRK should continue to strive for more demanding roles that test his skills as an actor. I am sure he still has a few surprises left in terms of his acting that we will witness over the coming years.Chak De India!!!",9,2,4,23 November 2007
The Killing Fields," Ankertill Brewer
","*may contain spoilers* This movie was quite shocking. I knew nothing of Cambodia and the horrors the country faced after the Vietnam war.  I went in cold to this movie, and was astounded by the images, especially the second half of the film.The actor who played Dith Pran was brilliant. The scene at the French embassy after the failed attempt to forge a passport for Pran, was heart wrenching.  Seeing Pran depart into the rain soaked streets of the Cambodian capital, brought tears to my eyes. Hard to believe that he had no formal training as an actor. Eassentially, he was re-living the part, as Ngor was a slave in one of the Khmer rouge death camps.Sam waterston, was passable as the US journalist.  Not really worthy of an academy award nomination.  But I did like john Malkovich's performance as a cynical photographer.  This is certainly a movie which has not been seen by many people, although it definitley warrants a viewing if you are a war buff or want to examine a period of histroy forgotten by many parts of the world.The scene with Pran in the ditch with hundreds of dead bodies will leave you sleeples for many nights.",7,2,4,25 April 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," An above average action flick that embarrasses the franchise
","T3 is a pretty good action movie with enough destruction to sustain the movie.  But, the movie falls much short of the epic scope which was provided by T1 and T2.  Jonathon Mostow does a commendable job of keeping the pacing tight and action high, but does very little with the story line.  It is essentially a retread of T2.In addition, I can forgive Mostow for using way too many absurd jokes at the expense of the Terminator in order to get a few chuckles from the audience.(Talk to the hand?!!  Elton John glasses?!!)I don't think there could have been a better action movie made than T2. The only man who could have attempted to undertake T3 and make it as good as its predecessors would have to be James Cameron.  But I believe Cameron opted out because he knew himself he could not do it and did not want to dissapoint the audience.On the plus side, the movie does seem to get better and better as you progress to the end.  The crane action stunt is absolutely amazing.  And we have to mention Arnie.  The man is and forever will be remembered as the Terminator. The TX again is a passable advesary, but Robert Patrick's T1000 will be remembered as the best villian from the Terminator series.I think this movie is definitely a rental. Not much on the DVD and the flick does not warrant multilple viewings ala T2.  I am sure there will be some sort of triple deluxe super edition in a couple of years just in time for Governor Arnie to make a come back in T4 fresh in his Golden years.6/10 /mb",6,0,0,11 November 2003
The Shining," Magnificently Intense!!!
","In my opinion this is one of Stanley Kubrick's greatest film, alongside A Clockwork Orange.  Not only because it follows a story-line that appeals to a mainstream audience, but also due to the intense, mind-blowing performance from Jack Nicholson.  The Man Was Nuts!!!  Kubrick films are always something special because you know each scene was probably filmed over fifty times before the director and actors were happy. As well I love the many tracking shots using the steadicam scattered throughout the film.  Plus the location the movie is shot at, genuinely creepy.  If you want a psychological horror film and not a slasher movie, check out The Shining.  (8 out of 10)",8,0,0,24 August 2002
American Beauty," Over rated, depressing not worthy of Oscar
","This movie is quite dark. I certainly did not enjoy the pedophile angle by Kenvin Spacey who I thought was much better in Seven and The Usual Suspects. In addition, the movie shows nothing new, just recycled ideas from David Lynches Blue Velvet, that all is not what it seems in suburbia.  Who could not see the ending coming from the first line of dialouge in the film?  Not to the mention the weird kid with the camera who likes to film floating garbage bags.  Definitely did not deserve the Oscar for best picture or actor in 99.  Watch the suberb, powerhouse acting of Russel Crowe in The Insider, which I beleive should have won best actor, director and picture in 1999. Prepare to be disapointed in this over-rated fluff, that will certainly not be remembered in 10 or 15 years.  Rent it for free if you can, or just wait for the edited tv version on TBS!!!",5,0,0,28 August 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," James Cameron's masterpiece!
","Terminator 2 is not only a mind blowing movie with spectacular special effects and unbeleivable action, but cultural phenomenon akin to capturing lightening in a bottle.Never will such a perfect action/sci fi movie ever be made in the history of filmdom.The casting of Arnold is perfect beyond belief.  He was born only to play the role of The Terminator.  His minimal dialogue enhances the roles mechanical robotic qualities.James Cameron is certainly a dedicated filmaker who cares about his work and the expectations of the audience.  The only other film that comes close to T2 is Aliens, also directed by Cameron.  His use of computer effects to augment and supplment the storyline is rarely ever used in todays overblown blockbusters.  In fact the special effects in T2 are so good that today's effects PALE in comparison.Robert Patrick is perfect as the predatory T-1000, and will be forever be remebered as the guy who gave Arnold a run for his money, as he definately attempts to steal the movie in some scenes.I am appalled that a T3 has been made without James Cameron.  T3 may be a decent action flick, but it looks embarrasingly juvenille from the trailers and TV spots.  Whats with all the sunlight???  Arnold even stated a few years ago he would not do T3 without Cameron.  After Arnolds diasasters such as End of Days (not bad flick) he needed a hit and the only way was to bring the Terminator out of retirement, with or without Cameron.  Thats Loyalty for you.T2 is the best action movie ever made, and if you have not seen it yet, you have probably seen paradies, ripoffs, and copies of the movie.
But watching the original will give an appreciation as to how this movie shaped future action movies, as it is groundbreaking.I wished James Cameron had made T3, but I doubt he could have topped the perfection of T2, and that may be one of the reasons he decided to opt out of T3.",9,6,8,5 July 2003
The Patriot," Kind of exciting
","The Patriot has a few thrilling fight sequences that are exciting to watch, but other than that it is quite cliched and predictable.  It seems as though this movie is a complete rip off of Braveheart, another Mel movie.  I am willing to be that there were numerous historical inacuracies in the film. Not the best movie, but probably a good time pass if its on TBS on a rainy Sunday afternoon.",6,0,1,18 April 2003
Being John Malkovich," Overrated film
","I was expecting a great movie, with lots of twists and turns.  Instead I got a below average flick with little plot.  Yes it is quirky and weird, but there have been better films made that are weird and hard to understand such as Fight Club, A Clockwork Orange and Memento.  I would not say that it is a waste of time, but you definitely have to be in a mood to sit down for two hours and not be mad afterwards for watching the flick.",5,1,2,20 June 2002
Aliens," The benchmark for all sci-fi action films
","!May contain mild spoilers! James Camerons sophemore film is an adrenaline rush, literally, from start to finish.  This is the sci-fi action film that all others must be measured by.There is non-stop action is this flick, along with some great acting and great one-liners from the cast.Ripley's reluctant return to the planet where the queen is planting all her eggs is a fascianating adventure.  I love to watch James Cameron films becasue he makes the sci fi genre look epic in scope while being fun and adventurous.Cameron's trademark false ending is a real surprise in Aliens, literally comes out of the blue.I really wish I could see this movie for the first time again, because it showcases an action director slowly coming into his prime(IMHO I believe Camerons best pic is still Terminator 2)Its also rare for a sci fi action movie to garner numerous academy award nominations as Aliens did.  Sigourney WEaver got a well deserved best actress nod.  She literally caries the entire picture.This is defitely the best Alien film out of all four movies.The firs Alien was slow simmering, isolated gross out movie The second, Aliens, is an all out action war movie, set in the climate of a hostile a alien life form. The Third, Alien 3, is a dark disturbing, but interesting failure.While the fourth one, Alien Ressurection, is an embarrassment to motion pictures around the world.Please watch Aliens, after watching the original.  It will blow your mind away./mb",8,0,0,26 May 2003
Pearl Harbor," Over-dramatic, over stylized, over-DUMB!
",What a bad movie! Ben Affleck was definitely not sober when he signed on to this jigoistic flick. A story which is paper thin (love triangle)interupts the real story(the invasion on pearl harbor)on many occasions.  I fast forwarded most of the second half because it was of no impact on the stroy of pearl harbor.  The worst part is the cardboard cutout characterizations and the groan worthy dialogue.  Horrible movie. Dont waste even a coupon for a free movie on Pearl Harbour.  I made the mistake of thinking it might actually be watchable.,4,0,1,4 July 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Surprisingly effective thriller!
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!The Butterfly Effect is a really good thriller. It has a fantasy/sci-fi/time travel theme that works well with the premise of the film.Surprisingly, Ashton Kutcher did a commendable job of playing the confused twenty something trying to set things right. Normally, most cannot stand his childish prank behaviour, but the guy may have a career in the movies if he picks the right scripts. As he did so in the Butterfly Effect.Don't expect a teen movie...the material in this flick is dark yet engaging. The R rating is well deserved....The directors cut on the DVD is very bold and stays true to the theme of the flick...I would definitely recommend the directors cut. Plot holes aside, the movie does grip you after the first 30 minutes of back story which involves the atrocities perpetrated by and against the stars of the film as youngsters....AFter Ashton begins his blackouts the film does not let up (save for the college scenes)....A great play on time travel, psycho-analysis and chaos theory....and again the end on the directors cut is one of the best endings to a thriller in years.Would highly recommend a DVD rental.",7,0,2,29 August 2004
Tigerland," gggggrrrrrreattt!!!!
","A fascinating look at the mind of a trainee for the vietnam war.  This is definitely Colin Ferrels breakout performance.  Hope he continues to make intriguing movies such as this.  I thought joel schumacher was a hack director, but this may be a bright spot on his resume. Looking forward to his Phone Booth with Collin Ferral.",7,0,0,21 June 2002
The Dark Knight," Give Heath the Oscar already!
","This is one of the few sequels that joins that rare pantheon of film which surpasses the original. Terminator 2, Aliens and The Godfather II come to mind. TDK joins that illustrious rank.Christian Bale IS Batman. No other actor before him has been able to portray the character as he has been able to. Not to mention he does an excellent job with the playboy billionaire Bruce Wayne.Gary Oldman has a great supporting role as Batman's only ally. Aron Eckhart is also good as Dent, but I felt the FX for Two-Face did not fit in with the realistic vision Nolan created. But only a minor complaint.Finally, Heath Ledger. HE IS THE JOKER!!!! The mannerisms, the inflections in his face, his walk, his talk, his look, his dialogs. Everything is perfect. Every detail has been studied by Ledger to create one of the most terrifying villains to ever grace the screen. Without a doubt, Heath will posthumously win the Oscar for best supporting actor. Without him this movie cannot be elevated to the great sequels of all time.I just hope that the inevitable third film can live up to this amazing sequel. Nolan will have to work extremely hard to top this magnificent film.",10,4,10,18 July 2008
The Graduate," Kind of disapointing
","I really enjoyed the first forty minutes of this movie. Especially with the nervous Dustin hoffman.  But after the the get together with Mrs. R, the movie does not hold my attention.  See this movie only for Dustin hoffmans performance as the naive graduate, and only the first half is good.",6,4,9,28 August 2002
The Last Samurai," A great movie that showcases some extraordinary battles
","I am commenting on this movie after I have noticed that it received very few Oscar nominations.  That is quite a shame, as the film is quite powerful and dramatic.  I beleive it is one of Tom Cruise's best performances. Unfortunately the academy is not interested in this sweeping, epic drama which has a great score and excellent battle sequences.  I am sure much of the audience found this movie to be intelligent and thought prevoking. It was certainly not your run of the mill action flicks.I think this movie will find an appreciative audience when it is release on dvd.9/10",9,0,0,27 January 2004
Blow," Interesting performance from Johnny Depp
","I really enjoyed this movie due to the performance of Johnny Depp. I beleive actors who try to expand their acting range are far more interesting than those who stick to one genre and milk it to death (ie nic cage and his action roles)  To be honest I have only seen Johnny Depp in one other movie, Donnie Brasco, and he was quite good with Al Pachino.  Some reviewers have called this movie a ripoff of Goodfellas with drug dealers.  i dont mind that, because Goodfellas is such a great movie, by copying the original, you get a sufficiently entertaining duplicate. I dug the stylish camera visuals of the film, and the soundtrack.  This was the best movie in Ted Demmes short career. Check this out if you enjoyed Goodfellas!",8,0,1,29 September 2002
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Best of all teen movies
","This movie brings back greate memories of shildhood for me. I was only 11 or 12 when i first saw it on video, and i laugh at it every itme i watch it. YOu can watch it many times and not get bored, like BACK TO THE FUTURE, another great time travel movie.  Plus, this movies has no drug use, no profanity and little sex and its a movie about two teenaged guys. VEry unique in our time and day.Check it out (Keeanu is perfectly cast)",10,0,0,5 May 2002
Slumdog Millionaire," A great story of an underdog!!!
","SM is a genuinely rousing film about the plight of a young boy who lives in poverty and rises to become a millionaire on a game show. His use of street smarts as opposed to book smarts should a reminder to the many that are uneducated that hopes and dreams can come true. Dev Patel was excellent in his role along with all of the younger actors.I found the film to be immensely enjoyable, with the performances of all involved to be quite three dimensional and believable. The soundtrack to the film by AR Rahman is amazing and he will surely win the Oscar.I read the book prior to watching the film, and it has a lot more details and subplots which were left out of the movie. Although I enjoyed the book, the movie has an emotional punch which leaves you with a smile at the end.A great recommend for those movie lovers who enjoy location filming as well. Danny Boyle did a phenomenal job surreptitiously filming in Mumbai and getting such an authentic film.POST Oscars WIN COMMENTS- Wow it won...amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9,0,1,30 January 2009
