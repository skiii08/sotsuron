Captain Phillips," If you're prone to motion sickness, STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM!!
","If you're prone to motion sickness, STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM!!About 99% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras. I understand what the director was going for, but this was WAY too much.I managed to get through the first 20 minutes or so before I had to make a run for it.I could only listen to the rest of the film. (If I'd been on my own, I would have left the theatre.) With half the dialogue sub-titled, and unable to open my eyes without risking another upheaval, it was impossible to follow.What I did manage to get through wasn't too bad. Tom Hanks doing what he does best. Playing an ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances.Shooting a film that is physically impossible to watch was a bad idea. At the very least, the film should come with a warning for those of us who are more susceptible.",1,25,60,19 October 2013
