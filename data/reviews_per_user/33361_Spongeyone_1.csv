The Blair Witch Project," Terrible
","This movie was literally painful for me to watch.  The style of camera work made me severely nautious, which didn't help my mood at having to sit through this fetid dung pile.  I will admit that i made an emotional connection with the characters in the movie: by halfway through, I passionately wanted them all to be painfully slaughtered. The most memorable part of seeing this movie for me was after it was over when  a friend of mine stood up in the theater and said 'wow, did that suck', which received a large round of applause.  I've NEVER heard a movie get booed in a theater before.",1,1,4,28 November 2003
