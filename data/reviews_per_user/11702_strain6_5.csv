Marie Antoinette," A visually dazzling as it subtle and serious. This is an excellent movie.
","Marie Antoinette is more subtle than the reviews and board commentary would have you believe. This is less of a teleplay than people are used to where themes and characterization are hammered home with a sledge. In fact, this is one movie where costumes have a thematic value. The constraint of corsets and elaborate dress parallel Marie's personal restrictedness. When she becomes queen, she has simpler, more comfortable clothes made for her which she wears in a place where she and her friends can be free of regulations of life at court, where she is as stifled in some ways as a convict in prison stripes. As in music or painting much is conveyed here without words. This movie is so visual in fact you should see it on a theater screen rather than wait for the DVD.",10,1,6,22 October 2006
Hostel," A Fun Little Shocker
","My first choice for a movie this year was Hostel, and I am glad of it. It has what I like most in an entertainment - sex and violence. The last movie that I saw in 2005 was Wolf Creek. It was darker and grimmer. I liked Wolf Creek but I don't know that I could recommend it. Hostel is a hoot. The element of suspense is well done. The plot tripped me up a few times when I thought that I had everything figured out, and the fun doesn't stop till the final frame. All the actors do an excellent job. Whether technically accurate or not, again to my delight, the actresses have shaved their legs and their underarms. Hostel also functions, in a way, as a great tourist ad for Holland. I definitely want to go there. Not so much Eastern Europe. Hostel is what a Saturday matinée is all about. See it!",10,9,18,7 January 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Room for Improvement
","Stranger than Fiction could have been sensational rather than okay. There was something low budgetly cult, to use John Water's phrase, about this movie. Putting two characters in a room and having them talk is cheap and not particularly cinematic. It produces a very static feeling in the audience, which should be mistaken for a deep feelings among the characters in the story. Save for the bovine Queen Latifah, the actors were excellent. After Cecil B. Demented, I hoped Maggie Gyllenhaal would be in a part like this. Will Ferrell's less than leading man's features gives us all hope because Maggie is stuff. Emma Thompson was also beautiful and engaging but her scenes reminded me of those photos of George Foreman with a cow on his shoulders. Dustin Hoffman seems to be doing a variation of his role in I heart Huckabees, and in middle-age is starting to look creepily like my dad. And I'm sure everyone knows what he looked like. It is making me identify with the Jason and Will characters for reasons that only affect me. The music was singularly intrusive and misguiding. It is indicative of what went wrong. If another mood was struck for the movie, possibly, brighter and with a lighter touch, this could have outshone the geek who did Human Nature, Being John Malkovich, etc.",7,0,2,9 December 2006
Fantastic Four," A Good Saturday Matinée Movie
","This was a good time at the movies. I wished the exciting bits could have been more exciting, but I have even less imagination than the screen writers, so I don't know how. All the Fantastic Four characters were well written, but developing four superheroes and a villain must be technically demanding. I wished for more from each of them, especially, Jessica Alba. This is the second time that she played a character who could have been naked and was not. That gripes my ass. What gripes it even more is gratuitous negritude, apparently, Hollywood's compulsory theme. Movies of this era will seem deformed, ridiculous, and antiquated. I want the people of the future to know that were those of us here in the past who realized that the trend was desperate and stupid. We contained our exasperation with idiots in charge as best we could.",6,0,2,9 July 2005
Sin City," Great Movie Only Marred by Guest Director
","There was a texture to the first and third stories that changes slightly for the worst when Tarantino gets his hands on Sin City. Since this is a long movie, I save this section for visiting the concession stand or taking a dump. The third time that I saw it I cleaned up some popcorn that I spilled under the seat. I got a thumbs up from the staff who would have had to clean up the mess I made and I could still hear Rosario Dawson over-acting and imagine all the close-ups that a face like hers doesn't deserve. All I could think of is the line from the movie that runs something like 'power is getting people to say they believe what they know in their hearts isn't true.' Why amateur acting is valued so highly is a matter of politics in this case. Artistically Tarantino is becoming the Sarcoma Kid,a pathetic case. I have seen Sin City three times on the strength of the rest of the movie and intend to see it at least a fourth time. It is hard to deal with a zit on a beautiful face sometimes.",9,0,0,17 April 2005
