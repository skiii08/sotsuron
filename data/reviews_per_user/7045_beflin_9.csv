Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Genius!
","Again, like all movies that I absolutely love that I rate an 8, I do so only in order to leave room for even greater masterpieces.I watched 'Borat' at home on DVD in 2006. What a gem!No one should believe that this movie intends to open up minds or break down barriers or any nonsense like that. This movie serves one purpose and one purpose well: to entertain and generate laughter.I cried from laughter throughout this movie. The sweet Jewish couple. The real estate meeting. The 'retired/retard' 'confusion'.I do remember it being not a perfect movie, but I cannot remember specifically why. Hence, my 8 rating.",8,0,1,27 July 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The right movie for the job
","Hayden Christensen is the best thing in this movie. From start to finish, his annoyance and rage at the Jedis appropriately builds. I felt nearly moved to tears when he killed the sand people to free his dying mother. I absolutely sympathized with his rage and desire to be the most powerful Jedi and to stop people from dying.The initial chase scene through the busy city planet after an assassination attempt on the Senator set the movie off to an exciting pace.I had to give 8 out of 10 for AOTC in order to leave room for a 10 out of 10 for Episode III: 'Revenge of the Sith'. Natalie Portman is thankfully less wooden than in 'The Phantom Menace'. I hate to deduct points for the slightly cartoony feel inside the robot-manufacturing plant. Otherwise, a perfect film.For evaluation of my objectivity and for context: I saw all three prequels in the theatre. My memory is a little hazy, but I believe I saw all six episodes in the theatre (I definitely saw one of the first three in the theatre way back then).",8,1,3,27 July 2009
Hot Rod," Extremely funny silly movie, and moving!
","I really really wanted to give this movie a full 10 out of 10. I really wanted to love it more. My main reason for doing so:The script is a 10 out of 10. Pam Brady did a fantastic job of writing silly one-liners and multi-line gags. I laughed at every one of them. Even stealing a famous gag from Family Guy but using it appropriately doubled the laughs precisely because I knew it was a rip-off of a famous FG gag.The acting is 10 of 10. Nothing wrong with what any of the actors did.I thought most of the deleted scenes were very funny too. I applaud the editor for leaving them out, nonetheless, to keep the pace up of the film.But, for some reason, I felt this movie required some kind of bigger production value. The problem is, I am not sure what. Oddly, the only thing I thought that MIGHT give the movie more bang or splash was changing the casting. This is where it gets embarrassing saying that, even though an actor does their craft perfectly, they still cannot change themselves.For example, suppose Rod Kimble were played by Will Ferrell, as 'larger-than-life' a character as Ron Burgundy is. Now, I am not saying Will Ferrell would have been a better choice for this movie for the role of Rod Kimble, but I kept feeling while watching 'Hot Rod' that it felt like an excellent movie put on by high school students.Anyway, I do encourage all of you to give this movie a 10 out of 10 if you write a comment on it.I did not want to detract from the 10 out of 10 for the script, because humor requires intelligence (on the part of the viewer/listener, I mean here). Not one joke or gag in 'Hot Rod' is racist or sexist or obscene, or makes reference to the absurdity of racism or sexist, for those bothered by other great films such as 'Borat'. Hence, comedy is MUCH harder to write than any serious drama, MOSTLY for this one reason.For that, I maintain a 10 out of 10, even though I felt the female characters were not given any silly comedic gags or lines, except for the 'tai chi' scene with Denise. The female characters were a little bit underused.I also appreciate the 'continued humor during the serious moments' style of writing: i.e. the character gets serious, but what she/he says is still outrageous and funny to the audience.",8,2,7,31 July 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," One new idea, some muddle, unresolved
","I scored a 7 out of 10. I watched on DVD, so I saw the entire unedited movie. I watched again just now on television.Overall, excellent acting.In all three movies, the idea is explored that both the physical 'real' world and the Matrix worlds have deterministic rules but both worlds have beings with consciousnesses inhabiting those worlds. Hence, those consciousnesses, which have free will, contradict the deterministic rules. The philosophical concept added to the original and 'Reloaded' in 'Revolutions' is the concept of Neo's mind separating from his body in the real world, since, if it can happen in the Matrix, why not in the real world? After all, both worlds are electromagnetic stimulation of the senses.However, even after having seen all three movies in order, I still do not understand what exactly the program Smith does when it occupies some other Matrix inhabitant's matrix-constructed body. Does that kill (I assume) the person in the real world?I also like the concept of the Matrix, Agent Smith more specifically, affecting or infiltrating the mind of a person in the real world. This concept was initiated in 'Reloaded' and developed in 'Revolutions'.There are other very small plot points that were not made clear, in 'Reloaded' and in 'Revolutions', which I really wished had been made clear by the end of the trilogy. Specifically, did Zion not have an EMP weapon to disable the sentinels during the big underground battle scene? Why did they have to wait for the Nebakenezzer to arrive to set off the EMP?However, my BIGGEST disappointment with this movie is that it felt completely unresolved. I expected and wanted to see all the individuals unplugged from the Matrix. The architect and oracle in the coda of the movie try to explain it away by saying they'll unplug those who want to be unplugged and questioning how long the peace will last. Well, obviously, peace will not last long as long as people are still plugged into the Matrix against their full knowledge and will.Otherwise, plot makes sense in 'Revolutions'. It moves along at an appropriate pace. I don't want to fault the movie too much, given the tension and excitement it creates. I admit that I felt slightly better about it upon a second viewing. But, I still do not understand why the biggest plot hole - immediate unplugging of all people - was not resolved at the end of the trilogy.",7,0,0,17 August 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," SOOOOO cute!
","Characters: 10 Story: 10 Story originality: 10 Sight gags: 10 Sight gags originality: 10 Jokes: 10 Jokes originality: 10 Speed: 9 (a little too fast in places to be able to catch everything) Come to think of it, compared to most CGI movies I've seen, I should take that back, and give 'Monsters vs Aliens' a perfect 10 for pacing during their visual gags. Guess I felt I had to be critical and find SOME fault with this movie in order to remain 'objective'. Nope - I really cannot find fault with this movie.Watched it on DVD, with the English subtitles, to make sure I don't miss anything.Best gag (as it makes a point about when it is necessary vs unnecessary to a story's plot or a character's motivation): Gallaxhar in the cloning device",10,0,1,21 October 2009
Children of Men," 'The Pianist' set in the future
","My score: 7 out of 10 I expected this to be yet another set-slightly-in-the-future, run-from-the-fascist-government, your-friends-drop-off-one-by-one survival movie, urban-warfare movie. I suppose I cannot honestly think of another movie that combines ALL those elements. 'Minority Report' - a brilliant original concept - has all but the friends-dropping aspect. 'Logan's Run' omits most of the urban-warfare. Frankly, I felt 'The Pianist', which, of course, is set in the 1939 Warsaw ghetto, comes the closest to matching the feeling of being on the run from a omnipresent fascist government and surviving under barren war-torn conditions as in 'Children of Men'.The incredibly-long-single-continuous shots in the urban warfare scene deserve a rewind: I lost my attention span somewhere halfway and don't remember where each edit cut begins.I couldn't help but think of Clive Owen in 'Shoot 'em Up' and every other high-octane film where he is constantly being shot at and laugh a little bit.The acting is great. I believe they got the technology 'right' for the year 2027 - very little improvement: a few animated advertisements on the sides of buses (and weed is still illegal!).Here are the three big negatives: no where is it revealed specifically WHAT the UK government and what the Fishes want with the newborn baby. I really wanted to know that throughout the entire movie. Was one side desiring to repopulated the earth, or just one portion of it, and the other side opposing, or vice versa? What did the two major issues of infertility and an immigration problem out of control in the UK have to do with each other? For this kind of movie, I felt they really needed to be related, because, otherwise, my mind could not help think throughout the movie that a long period of worldwide infertility implies a general DECLINE in human population and, hence, a REDUCTION in immigration problems? I was SUPREMELY disappointed in the sudden ending, expecting the story to go fully into whatever the Human Project was about, even if it was to repopulate the earth. I still needed to know the details. Perhaps, that was NOT its purpose: who knows? Perhaps another twist lay in wait.",7,3,7,30 July 2009
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," 10 first half, 8 second half
","Script = super, super sleek Chemistry of characters and actors = perfect 10 Originality of story = 10. Writers knew how to walk that incredibly narrow line between being over-the-top versus instilling real feeling in the characters' sense of danger while simultaneously wondering whether to hold their marriage togetherVince Vaughn = perfect 10 for charm and wit and charismaI watched this the first time on DVD rented from the library. As I always do, I watch with the subtitles on, so I don't miss a word. When the movie ran again last night on cable TV, I could not hear a lot of the lines. So, audio balance was not good in a number of spots.Also, after the Smiths join forces at the 'end of Act 1', then the basic humorous plot of the story falls out - that of them both being spies, married to each other, and trying to kill each other. Hence, the 8 for 'Act 2'. On the other hand, I am not sure how much longer the screenwriters would have been able to drag that particular plot point. The pacing for the entire movie is, also, a 10 out of 10.",9,2,4,14 November 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A depressing masterpiece
","I will try to avoid as much spoilers as possible. I am going by my memory from seeing this movie in the theatre in 2005. I remember that there is little plot and endless battle.I came away from this movie feeling depressed for days, thinking of the order by the Emporer to murder all the Jedi.This movie actually made me think: which makes a better army, and why: droids or clones?Most importantly, the overall political theme: that of a once great republic transforming itself, almost imperceptibly, into the evil tyranny, has not been demonstrated so spectacularly in any other movie. There is some great line now citizen Padme utters regarding this - I wish I could remember it.Hayden Christensen's performance is perfect for this role and movie. It is heart-wrenching to see the pregnant Padme confront Anakin right before the movie's final showdown between Kenobi and Anakin.Regarding my objectivity: I love all the 'Star Wars' movies, but I never bought them nor any related paraphernalia (I don't collect stuff that is already 'out there'). ROTS is the perfect logical ending (or midway point, I suppose) to the Star Wars sextet.",10,0,4,27 July 2009
Blow," Great movie!
","It is great to see a movie that knows the distinction between 'anti-drug' versus 'anti-drug-dealer'. This movie shows the human side of prisoners of war in the war against drug choice and drug freedom. It does not demonize George Jung nor make him out to be a perfect human being. For instance, he is not portrayed as the best father in the world. Nevertheless, this distinction and balance is desperately needed in Hollywood's current extreme state of bias in movies against drugs.Johnny Depp and Paul Reubens and Ray Liotta play their characters with wonderful sensitivity. They create no dull moments on the screen. The movie would have benefited from seeing at least one montage of the final buyers of cocaine. I would like to see from where all those bags and bags of cash ultimately came!",8,0,1,27 July 2009
