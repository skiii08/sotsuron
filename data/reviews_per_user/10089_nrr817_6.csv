Scarface," You need films like this. You need films like this so you can point your fingers and say 'That's the bad one.'
","I will go ahead and say that Scarface is my all-time favorite film, so this may be slightly biased. Yes, the movie is over-the-top, overdone, and excessive. However, when the tag line is 'The world is yours,' what other way is there to do it? The movie is supposed to be this way because Tony Montana (Al Pacino) wants it all, as in the world and everything in it.Pacino can be a fireball, and he is nothing short of that as Tony Montana, an overly ambitious, short-tempered political prisoner from Cuba during the Castro-Revolution era. There are 226 uses of the 'f' word in the film, and Montana probably accounts for 90 percent of them. If anyone else would dare take on such a character with an excessively profane script, which was written by Oliver Stone, the film probably would have been a bust because Pacino did it so well to me and it has become the staple of his career along with Michael Corleone in the Godfather films. The story is also just so incredibly played out throughout the film. I have never watched a film 170 minutes or longer that goes by in what feels like an hour, not even The Godfather or The Godfather: Part II. From the 'political prisoner from Cuba' scene to the epic 'Say goodnight to the bad guy' monologue, and of course 'Say hello to my little friend,' a plot in a film has never interested me so much, not even Godfather I and II.Going back to the 'Bad Guy' rant, there's a reason why I chose to make my own little 'spin-off' of it as the title, if you want to call it that. It's my favorite scene in the movie, and it is really the whole point of the film. After having an argument with his wife, Tony is sitting alone in a restaurant with everyone staring at him, and he says, 'You're all a bunch of f*****' ass*****. You know why? You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be. You need people like me. You need people like me so you can point your f*****' fingers, and say 'that's the bad guy.'' The point being made is that Tony is viewed as a bad person because he is not afraid to be who he is, a short-tempered, overly ambitious man who will not hesitate to speak his mind. So many people in the world are so concerned with being liked and accepted by others, they don't stay true to who they really are and become someone they aren't, and they never obtain true happiness with that person they become, so they judge people who aren't like them and other people they try to be like. Tony goes on to say, 'So, what that make you? Good? You're not good. You just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth, even when I lie. So say goodnight to the bad guy! Come on! The last you're gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you.' When you watch the other people in the restaurant while Tony is saying this and looking around at them, it is very apparent that Tony is speaking the truth. When Tony tries to look at the people, they simply look straight down with a look on their faces as if they have been found out by the 'bad guy' who is 'below them.'Moving on to another reason why it's been my favorite film since I was 10 is four simple words, 'The World is Yours.' I truly believe it anytime I read it, say it, or think about it. That's what I think of when I think of the iconic masterpiece that is Scarface, not all of the over-the-top acting, swearing, blood, violence, or the overly flashy suits. Those four words are what inspired rich celebrities like P. Diddy and Shaquille O'Neal to achieve what they've achieved. Those four words sold millions of posters that hang on walls all across the world. Those four words inspire me to be a accomplish great things in my life.To conclude, and make one last reiteration to the title of the review, if you hate the movie for all the reasons I previously listed, which I can understand, ask yourself this. 'Are all those things the only things this movie is about?' The answer is no. Think with your brain, not your eyes and ears, see the film with your mind instead of your eyes. That's how I came up with my interpretation of the film that it is over-the-top and excessive but that's the way the film was supposed to be, and it was not afraid to be shown the way it is shown. Scarface is the 'bad guy' of cinema, in my opinion, and I have been a huge fan of the 'bad guy' for a long time. You need films like this so those people described earlier can point their fingers and say 'that's the bad film,' or 'it's terrible, pointless, mindless, excessive violence with too much blood, swearing, and yelling.' So, what does that make them and the movies that they like just because their friends and peers like them? Good?",10,1,3,13 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Equal to the Perfect Original
","The Godfather: Part II, along with The Godfather, is the greatest film ever made. In all likelihood, anyone else who appreciates great films that has seen the two would agree that both are absolute masterpieces of film and are as close to perfect as you can get. Part II maintained the rest of the core cast from the original with Michael (which Pacino deserved an Oscar for his portrayal), Tom, Kay, Fredo, and Connie. While Part II lacks Brando's Don Vito Corleone, Sonny (except for a flashback), Clemenza and Sollozzo, it makes up for it with De Niro's young version of Vito, Hyman Roth, and Frank Pentangeli. The beautiful music also carries over from the original. The two stories of Michael expanding his empire to Nevada and Cuba and how young Vito started his career in New York are perfectly played out.In fact, what many people don't know is that while the original is based on Mario Puzo's novel, Part II, with the exception of the story how Vito's rise to power, is completely original material. The Godfather: Part II is a must watch for anyone who truly loves film. It is one of those films that you should watch at least once in your lifetime.",10,1,5,1 February 2014
The Dark Knight," Ledger Gives a Legendary Performance in a Great Film
","Not being fan of comic books or movies adapted from comic books, I remember going to the theater with my friends thinking I wouldn't care for The Dark Knight, after it ended, I'll admit it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great like everyone was saying it was. Then after some time passed, I watched it again, and I was blown away.Heath Ledger, who in most cases is THE reason the film became so loved, gave us an academy award winning performance that was undoubtedly the best of his tragically cut short career as Batman's nemesis, The Joker. In fact, Ledger actually locked himself in his hotel room for a month and kept a journal during filming to become engulfed with the character, and for most of the film it doesn't look like he is even acting, he IS The Joker. It was the best portrayal of a villain in a film since Sir Anthony Hopkins' legendary role of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, and I personally believe Ledger's Joker is second only to Hopkins' Lecter in terms of being scary, creepy, but also very interesting at the same time.As great as Ledger is the film, there actually are some other great performances. Gary Oldman is more than respectable as Gordon, Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent is, to me, the second best role in the film, and Christian Bale does not disappoint as Bruce Wayne/Batman.Technically, the film is also very well done. An academy award victory in sound editing and nominations in cinematography, art direction, film editing, and visual effects prove that film passes all aspects of the eye test with flying colors.The Dark Knight is one of the best films since 2000, in my opinion. The #4 spot on the IMDb top 250 also doesn't hurt. It is a must-watch for not just Batman fans, but any fan of great films.",9,0,2,15 February 2014
There Will Be Blood," An Incredible Story of Ambition vs Faith
","There Will Be Blood is one of the best films of the 2000's. The great Daniel Day-Lewis gives us (at least in my opinion) his best performance with his portrayal of the ambitious oil pioneer Daniel Plainview. So determined and greedy is Plainview, he goes to the length of even proclaiming his adopted and deafened son HW his competition and an enemy after HW wants to follow in his father's footsteps and start his own drilling company. An incredible story is also told of how entrepreneurship and ambition clash with the old-fashioned, faith based values of the traditional priest Paul/Eli Sunday, who was played by Paul Dano.The film also has many great scenes, but it has one of the most memorable scenes of the 2000's. Anyone who has seen what happened in Plainview's bowling alley and has heard Plainview make that sucking sound and utter those famous words, 'I, drink, your, MILKSHAKE. I DRINK IT UP!' has most likely had that sound and those words stuck in their heads after watching it, myself being one. As much as I liked No Country for Old Men, I also believe There Will Be Blood should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. A truly great work of art.",10,1,2,14 February 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," One of the Most Memorable Perfromances of All Time and a Great Film
","Words cannot describe how truly great Sir Anthony Hopkins is in this masterpiece. His Oscar-winning portrayal of Dr. Hannibal Lecter is one of the best performances of all time, and AFI actually listed him as the #1 villain in their top 50 heroes and villains list. There has never been a more creepy, scary, and at the same time, fascinating character before or since The Silence of the Lambs was released. The closest I've seen is Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight.As great as Hopkins is, let's not forget how the great the film is as a whole. Jodie Foster was outstanding as Agent Starling and she even won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her efforts. The film is also beautifully directed by Jonathan Demme, who also won an Oscar. For those counting, The Silence of the Lambs won five of the biggest Oscars, the other two being Best Picture and Best Writing/Screenplay based on the previously published novel of the same title by Thomas Harris.The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best films of the last 25 years and it is one of those films that any fan of great films must watch at least once in his or her life.",10,2,3,17 February 2014
The Godfather," The Greatest Film Ever Made
","There isn't much that I can say about The Godfather that hasn't been said a million times. A masterpiece, as close to a perfect film as you can get, arguably the best film ever made, 'a film you can't refuse,' etc. Coming from a guy who's favorite films have mafia/gangster-related themes, The Godfather is the greatest film ever made in the history of U.S. cinema, in my slightly biased opinion.From the legendary music (beautiful work by Nino Rota), to the cast and the acting (Brando, Pacino, and Caan), to the cinematography (brilliantly done by Gordon Willis, aka 'The Prince of Darkness'), to the fascinating story and everything in between, there is nothing about this film that disappoints. It is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once in his or her lifetime, because the chances are that you will want to watch it again.",10,2,4,31 January 2014
