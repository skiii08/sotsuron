Your Name.," A stunning film!
","-This was such an enjoyable film! I laughed, and was smiling throughout. -One of the many things I love about Japanese filmmaking is that they create a mood. Not every scene is directly plot related, but helps to bring you into the film. -If you have been, this film will certainly make you want to return to Japan! A well balanced mix of Tokyo, and Japanese countryside -Heartwarming, and gorgeous. A story about a boy and a girl connected through their dreams, and the impact they make in each other's lives via the dream connection. I definitely recommend this film is you have enjoyed any Japanese animation in the past. One of those heartwarming, easy to watch films that sometimes we all need for a long, joyful exhale of emotion.",9,2,4,25 December 2016
