The Blair Witch Project," pretty poor
","Unfortunately the Bad acting and poor dialogue/script of an interesting but apart from the last scene totally unscary film. Not so original as some think either see last broadcast, both have some atmosphere but not enough. It came out at the right time and was a little different from other films at that point ... however that alone does not make it good or scary. You really need to see something like the Innocents with deborah Kerr to find a film which is scary purely by good acting and the atmosphere a good director can create. A basic lack of gore on the other hand was very welcome as they at least tried to frighten rather than nauseate.",4,2,4,27 August 2010
