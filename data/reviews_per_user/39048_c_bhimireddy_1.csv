The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," What a disappointment...
","First, I LOVE Twilight series, but this was such a disappointment. It seemed like the director relied too heavily on the actor's stardom, their chemistry, gory scenes, and the greatly anticipated wedding (which was almost NOTHING like the book). The movie just felt so 'diluted.' It could've been one of the best movies of the series, but it was quite dull and unconvincing.One trivial aspect that was just simply distracting is the difference in Edward's hair. Although it's more true to the book, it's not anything like the first 3 movies, and the color looked 'flat/dull' on the big screen.)WARNING: Spoilers below... Acting overall was just awful this time around. Important things like Edward's grief at seeing Bella so weak were barely portrayed, and he came across as distant and angry, not torn and desperate as in the book - as if he's in his own personal hell! Miss Stewart's face was almost blank and lifeless most of the film. Yet, the director chose closeups for her in MANY scenes, and her acting ability just wasn't up to the task of conveying any range of emotions. In fact, multiple times if I hadn't read the book I'd have no clue what she was feeling! What's worse is the lack of substantive dialogue in the movie, which is Meyer's strength. So on screen the acting had to be stellar, but was lack- luster. Better dialogue/screen writing would've helped greatly to mask the lack of emotional dynamics. They left out so many conversations, and their dialogue wasn't quite true to the characters. Many details are left out, so many that the story doesn't seem to hold together. And don't get me started on my frustrations of the pack-splitting scene. The wolves voices were so fake sounding and overly dramatic compared to the rest of the movie's tone.",5,8,13,20 November 2011
