Your Name.," 'Gift' to the hopeless nation
","'The disease which humans are last affected is 'hope'.'
This quote originated from Saint-Exupéry, the French author of 'The Little Prince', is one of the sales copies of this film.Blockbuster films always reflect an atmosphere of the era.Once in Japan, in exchange for the energetic economy having drastically arisen by the recovery from the WWII, people had lost the relationship with others. Recently, they also released their economic advantages to other countries which has been their last resort. Moreover, tossed about by social network services targeting each person's approval desire, human relationships acceleratingly have become vacant. Nowadays, a sense of stagnation is spreading throughout the country.Through this process, the chronic disease gradually infected people and several levels of their communities including nation, companies, men, women, young, elderly, and even children. The name of the disease is 'hopeless'.In this film, a boy and a girl face the impatience that is not easily accessible to each other, quite typical in orthodox romance stories. Unlike the other ones, this irritating situation is highlighted by contrasting the spatiotemporal distance between them, and also the distance between this world and the other world derived from a Buddhism concept. This distance as best blend of these scientific and religious descriptions is the straightforward metaphor of the desperate gap between hope and hopeless in our reality.Body switching, Sci-Fi, young romance, beautiful CGs, catchy songs, etc.... Crowd pullers are smartly packed into this film though, outstanding was its title. 'Your' is the most equal word for everybody. Definitely this word sense gave sympathy to any generation, even to the elderly, thereby reminding of their own experiences: 'whenever and wherever in your life, fortune can be (or could have been) encountered.' This universal message could touch one's too dry mind like an oasis in a desert.About sixty years ago just after the WWII, exactly the same titled film was also the blockbuster in Japan, when people had surely the hope to reconstruction supported by firm human relationships nevertheless in poverty. On reflection, since today's people are living in the era of a digital visualization of everything, they may retrospectively desire such an analog type of 'hope'.",9,0,0,1 November 2018
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Supreme Ghibli film, as an epic
","Over 30 years ago, a film director predicted how the world would be like quite precisely, and his extensive knowledge, ideas, thoughts, and imagination were tried to reflect on this film. However, this attempt did not result in complete success, because the film could not accommodate his too much big ideas due to substantial reasons at that time.His excellent predictions imaginatively described a devastating future resulted from nuclear wars, atomic energy, and abuse of technology, as you can easily imagine living in this century. Nonetheless, Nausicaa does not fully solve the mystery of this world, and this film suddenly ends when Nausicaa resurrected by big insects which she soothecalmed, meaning that the peaceful world has come. Despite of whether this ending are satisfying, note that this is not the original ending in the comic, he really wanted to depict.In the original story of his comics, the relationship between insects (or rotten woods) and people reverses again. Like, polluted airs are actually clean, and clean airs will afflict people. This makes readers be more confusing, 'which side is truly right?'. The director told his producer about this changeover, 'this is life'. At the end of the abstruse tale, a destiny finally made Nausicaa a dramatic decision.This reversal of values well represents the 21st world which we live in. Around globalism, religion, wealth...people should face and deal with these multiple ambivalent confrontation axes. Moreover, no one can tell the easy answer of these complicated questions, exemplifying political events in England and US.Hence, this historical magnificent tale tells us how the destiny of selfish mankind will become. This tale is not a fairy tale, but an incredibly realistic prediction for us, who are likely to forget nature and misuse technology. This is why this tale is often regarded as an epic poetry, like Odysseia, from which the name of Nausicaa derives.",10,0,0,1 November 2018
Princess Mononoke," Transcendence over conflict
","'Nature vs. human' is clearly one of the central topics of this film. What many people misunderstand is that, however, this 'human' (symbolized by 'Jigo') includes most of ordinary people in the world who live in a wood-made house, drive a car exhausting gas, and use plastic-made goods, not only the definitely hopeless money-driven people who typically make a golf-course by cutting woods.From the bird's viewpoint, modern capitalism or neoliberalism is coherently and thoroughly criticized, for San (Princess mononoke) symbolizing 'nature' is consistently not compatible with 'human' until the end. Asitaka intends to reconcile 'nature' and 'human', but unfortunately his way is to accept the conflict and discrepancy of them with his endless struggle. So the dog-god Moro strictly advised him to 'live' beforehand.In the mid 90's, 'lost 25 years', a continuous economic decline, were just beginning in Japan when people committing suicide were increasing in the locked-up feeling. On the other hand, people who lived in the Muromachi era around 500 years ago always deliberated their views of life and death facing daily deaths. The strong and catchy message of this film, 'do live', thus having a double-meaning, must be widely accepted 20 years ago.After 20 years still in the economic decline and left behind the global economy, Japan rather seems to recover its harmony with nature and human or anti-capitalism compared to that time. So far partly and still fashionable though, no golf and no cars, increase in young people loving more rural areas than urban ones, development of ecosystem such as electric cars, the advent of minimalism and sharing economy... probably these new trends would be life sprouts after their economic death, as if caused by Shishi-gami!",10,1,1,1 November 2018
