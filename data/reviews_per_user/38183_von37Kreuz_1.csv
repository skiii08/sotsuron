Ali," Flabby pop promo with great performances.
","Michael Mann apes Scorcesse using endless disconnected music to bail out his flabby movie. Will Smith works hard but never looks more than Will Smith an Ali wig, Jon Voight looks like a muppet in all his prosthetic makeup. Endless deep and meaningless profile shots of Smith jogging, walking, watching backed by full on DRAMATIC music. Agitating rather than stimulating. Like 'Twister' boring and irritating. Smith and Voight's scenes work well due to the actors and the fight scenes are probably the best boxing scenes since The Set Up. But the film does not resonate. 5/10",6,0,0,7 March 2002
