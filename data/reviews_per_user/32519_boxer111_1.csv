Resident Evil: Afterlife," Not as bad as some say
","I am giving this a 7 out of 10 due mainly because it is MUCH better than the last 2, this has a much better storyline and there were even some clearer fragments of the game.OK, OK, there were some odd parts that made no sense like the zombies digging tunnels!! They are zombies they don't think or do they now? This was perfectly done in 3D, not over excessive and done just right which I really enjoyed and is well worth paying admission for. There are some bits which are clearly obvious and a couple plot holes. But it did leave me wanting to see then next instalment, yes they left it WIDE open for the next one but unlike the last couple episodes this ending was worthwhile and I do look forward to seeing how they will get out of it.I was a big fan of the game, still am and the last couple movies, although entertaining with friends was not worth it, this was worth it. Go see...",7,3,8,22 September 2010
