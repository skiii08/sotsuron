Changeling," Good, not great
","One thing I like about films directed by Clint Eastwood is their consistent attempt to depict the shattered American Dream. In this case, the shattered dream is that of justice in the LA of the late 20s and early 30s. Clearly, the dream has suffered at the hands of an LAPD and a judicial system that fall far short of normal requirements, even for that time. Eastwood tells the story well but it is difficult to swallow the fact that the changeling had a mother of his own and yet he was willing to impersonate young Walter and so pass off as Christine Collins' son. I thought at first that it might be because he had run away from harm but, alas, that was not the case. Sadly, that apparently minor detail opens a massive credibility gap in the film's narrative. That aside, praise must go to the effective direction, the generally sound acting, above all to the scrupulous attention to period detail, and the awesome photography. In terms of acting, the duplicitous nature of the murderer is superbly conveyed by Jason Harner but there is one serious minus: Angelina is too 'jolie' and too stereotyped, a typical beauty down to her hat and clothing with the photography clearly emphasizing that beauty in its time capsule.As the movie progressed I found it hard to detect any real emotion in Jolie. Perhaps Estwood wanted to extract a restrained approach from her but I just do not think it works. As I see it, that is a central weakness in the film but when all is said and done, and in spite of those drawbacks, Changeling is a film well worth seeing especially because Eastwood refuses to provide an easy remedy to a very difficult situation and ultimately to paper over yet another crack in the American dream. Eastwood's honesty I value most of all: He does not shirk the usefulness of the death penalty to rid society of elements clearly unfit to live in it and, most importantly, unable to admit their evil deeds.",7,6,11,9 January 2009
Milk," Good film, outstanding Penn
","Not being American and not being gay I had no idea what this film was about. I had not read any reviews of it and I went to see it because I am an unconditional fan of Sean Penn as an actor (not so much as a director). And I have to say that my intuition was correct - this is another superb performance from the man. From a physical standpoint, his depiction of Harvey Milk is uncontrived and extremely well observed. From the standpoint of character, merit must be shared with Director van Sant and the screen writing team but he certainly emerges as a plausible, life-like person with qualities such as generosity, love, caring for his neighbour (especially if gay), and a positive ambition for politics, along with the flaws of backstabbing and selfishness that any politician must have to survive. Most interesting of all, though, is the conflict that pits Penn and Josh Brolin in the role of fellow San Francisco Mayor's Office supervisor Dan White. They could not be more different: Milk is gay - a status largely unaccepted and even derided at the time - while White is heterosexual, married, and with children to boost his image as a more conventional politician. Yet, as the film wears on one realizes how much more unbalanced, vindictive, politically incorrect and ultimately murderous White is and how the unacceptably gay Milk is the type of person society really needs to grow because of his ability to listen, care, get involved, and share thoughts. Brolin and Franco ably support Penn with outstanding performances. Director van Sant reconstructs the San Francisco of the 1970's with great conviction and attention to detail (his depiction of the crowds in hippie and liberal attire is astonishing). Historic events surface unobtrusively, keeping the film chronologically situated and credible, in addition to providing much needed information that never interferes with the development of the central character and the action around him. In addition to excellent and never pervasive camera work, Van Sant uses the flashback technique in a far subtler way than I have seen in any film I can remember. Having watched the competition for the Academy Awards (apart from The Reader) I would confidently vote for Penn as best actor, van Sant as best director, and Milk as best picture.",8,4,8,14 February 2009
Apocalypse Now," Superlative
","APOCALYPSE NOW is a masterpiece whether you see the truncated earlier version or the more recent, extended version. The direction is superb, the screenplay excellent with its ironical and occasionally over the top depiction of the uselessness of war and of the degradation of moral values. Duvall is memorable as the colonel who loves to wake up to the smell of napalm; Martin Sheen has his best role ever by a mile; Brando is an enigmatic larger than life metaphysic that appears to have won the minds of the enemy but lost his own; the photography is exquisite; and the sequence with the French family in a colonial setting is an absolute treasure. But there is much more to enjoy, from the much repeated helicopter sounds at the beginning of the movie to the vagaries of fighting a war you do not care for. I will always go back to this movie, watch it with pleasure and learn something new from it. A fabulous film that deserves 10/10.",10,4,5,24 June 2008
Quantum of Solace," Disappointing to say the least
","Banal intro; banal music; stylized and uninvolving action sequences; no real mean villain; and several lost threads in the story. Daniel Craig is still very good, as is Judy Dench, but this is a Bond movie breaking with many traditions. Bond breaks from his shaken, not stirred Martini, from dropping his name, and from a sense of humor (though the sequence where he picks Mathis' wallet is exceptional in terms of dark comedy). As anyone will tell you revenge is pointless -- nor can it be anything else in a Bond movie or the censors will wield the big scissors -- so in the end this is also a pointless movie and one that feels oddly dishonest. Water and oil really do not mix, especially in the desert.",5,5,6,15 November 2008
Gran Torino," Well, I have seen much better from Clint
","Clint Eastwood is one of my all time heroes both as an actor and as a director so I was really looking forward to watching this film in which he does both jobs. He also has a knack for depicting the crack in the American dream as illustrated by Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, The Unforgiven, and so forth -- but this time the whole thing appeared to be more about racist Paleface Clint becoming a better person than anything else, so I came away somewhat disappointed. In what might well be Clint's final acting performance (he is beginning to look old and creaky) I witnessed a rehash of all the Dirty Harry and man with no name stuff under the guise of an old man who seemingly cares for no one and is tough as nails but underneath is a real softy. He retains all his well established celluloid courage as an old dog of war that keeps the young and fit criminals in their place.The way he wins over the Asian neighbors that he keeps insulting and turning away really stretches your imagination. But at least the intention is good and it is refreshing to see his exchanges with the untiring Catholic priest who does his utmost to get him to confess and save his soul.In a finale reminiscent of John Wayne in 'The Shootist,' Clint commits public suicide and apparently places his faith with a number of witnesses that had up to that point been very wary to report anything on the criminal gangs for fear of retribution. Personally, I thought it a pointless suicide. I'd much rather have seen Clint go out blasting away and taking with him a few bad eggs. But that is my obviously very subjective viewpoint.I am giving this film a 7 but 6.5 would be closer to the mark. May Clint live many more years and direct many more great films. This one and The Changeling have provided blips on the lower side of the quality graph but they are still well worth admission price.And - I'm sure Clint will bounce back with more quality films in the near future!",7,14,23,2 April 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Visual, acting beauty
","I have not read the F. Scott Fitzgerald literary piece that serves as the basis for this film but the idea is extremely interesting, and the clock by Mr Gateau that runs counter clockwise is a wonderful figment of the imagination that sets the whimsical tone for the whole exercise. David Fincher's direction comes across as very sound. There is no doubt he is one of the most competent directors around, especially from a technical viewpoint. He keeps continuity fluid, he extracts a superb performance from Brad Pitt and a delicately enticing one from Blanchett, and the photography is gorgeous, including memorable sunsets, Blanchett dancing against the skyline, winter shots and pleasing compositions throughout. The attention to period detail is most impressive, filmed with loving memory and care, down to the flickering pictures of the late 19th century.It is, however, the way that the film conveys the inflexible vagaries of time that impresses me most. With it stems the realization that the oft-stated wish that one should not get old certainly could do without the alternative of getting younger on the outside only. Sadly, all the cosmetic surgery of the current age appears to seek that very goal but, though great to look at, Brad and Kate are definitely worthy human beings capable of love for each other and for mankind. There is nothing cosmetic about their feelings and values but perhaps one flaw is that Fincher needlessly adds 20 or so minutes emphasizing Brad's youthful good looks in particular, and perhaps the scene of Blanchett's accident could do with a little bit less repetitive explaining of the inexorability of fate. That said, I see those as minor foibles.Benjamin Button brings to mind the figure of Forrest Gump as he wanders through the box of chocolates of life -- but he emerges as infinitely more intelligent and perceptive. There is something Christ-like about Benjamin that adds to the subtly religious experience the film offers going back to the pastor that gets Benjamin walking, the passing of the piano teacher, and the chanting at Queenie's funeral.Curiously, as Benjamin Button's brain begins to age and become erratic and forgetful I was also reminded of Hal, the computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey, as his memory bank was dissembled; and Benjamin's last shot as a newborn but perishing baby brought to mind the starchild at the end of the Kubrick film.All told, I liked it very much. The fact that it made my brain tick, that it ushered in so many possibilities, and that it has stayed with me pleases me no end. It stands as a rare item in this age of mass production and bended knee to technology. I hope it does well at the box office and receives the plaudits it deserves from critics, the Academy and the rest of it. Highly recommended!",9,2,3,20 January 2009
Some Like It Hot," A belly full of laughs, vintage entertainment!
","Well, dear fellow film lovers: If you ain't seen this one you ain't seen nuttin'! A few years ago, 'Some like it hot' was rated the greatest comedy ever made and though I do not much care for -- or believe in -- such ratings the fact is that I was readily in agreement with this one and I continue to think so.It is a film full of verve, sharp dialog, stinging one-liners, quick pace, imaginative chase sequences, and possibly the quickest-witted ending answer in the history of the cinema: Nobody's perfect! Yep, too true, nobody is perfect - but in this movie director Billy Wilder came as close to the Holy Grail of a perfectly directed movie as I can remember: Marilyn was at her most sensual and in the best acting form I ever saw from her; Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Joe E. Brown and George Raft peerless; and the supporting cast of Nehemiah Persoff, George E. Stone, and many others was marvellous. Absolutely no weaknesses in the acting that I could detect.Finally, a word about the outstanding photography in the 'film noir' tradition yet never interferes with the smooth narrative.What a movie! What a world that was without computers, cellphones, and all the other global technological and economic dictatorship gadgets that control our lives.",10,3,4,8 April 2009
There Will Be Blood," Truly repellent characters
","As awesome as the acting is, especially on the part of Daniel Day-Lewis, I came away wondering why I had lost more than two hours of my valuable time watching a film about two souls so cynical and deceitful that they could not possibly add anything to my life or my values as a human being. The last quarter of the movie was also ponderous and turgid. The Oscar given to Day-Lewis was well deserved and the first hour of the film was intense and eminently watchable though the Day-Lewis character was quite repellent from the outset. Once that hour was up the film tragically went one-way downhill, which did not say much for the quality of direction. Photography? Again, quite splendid in the first half, then flopped like the rest of the film. Was Day-Lewis the ultimate incarnation of Satan and a symbol of savage capitalism?",6,2,5,25 August 2008
American Gangster," Mediocre
","I am afraid I am borrowing views expressed in some of the other crits: This film borrows extensively from classics as The Godfather, The French Connection, Scarface and even Apocalypse Now but it comes nowhere near any of them. The acting is not bad but I have a problem with the development of the central character, Frank Lucas. He appears to have some principles but quickly embarks on the narcotics trade, cares not who else it might affect, and does not think twice about executing a competitor in public. Lucas kissing his brother on the mouth and later beating him up smacked of The Godfather Part II relationship between Pacino and Cazale but it did not come across anywhere near as viscerally. In the end, just so that he does not spend the rest of his life in jail he is willing and reptilian enough to turn in all those that he bribed and that served him. Perhaps his flaws are only human but I care more for a mad bugger like Tony Montana in Scarface than for this cold-hearted kingpin that uses national institutions such as the US Army for personal gain and should face high treason but instead skulks away with a reduced jail term as if that were ennobling and worthy of 157 minutes of film. Russell Crowe comes across more credibly as a copper who places job before family but real life has its ironies and I did not think a honest man like him would become a defense lawyer whose first client would be... Frank Lucas. Ridley Scott's direction lacks verve and inventiveness and it rambles here and there, especially when Lucas' family comes into the picture. The period detail is adequate though I have seen better. The cinematography is of tolerable quality (I have watched more polished TV productions). Finally, the screenplay is a patchwork of clichés I would not have wanted my name associated with. This is a big production movie with big stars to match with the aim of doing well at the box office, and I am sorry I paid hard earned money for this product thereby indirectly helping maintain this industry that treats spectators like so many sheep. American Gangster is mediocre film-making, its moral values are dire, and the lesson I gleaned was an old one: As long as you have money and connections you can get away with murder. I doubt that knowledge makes me a better man but it sure as hell renders me fitter for survival. Is that what I want out of life, though? NO!",5,5,7,16 January 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A very good, imaginative film that also depicts India truthfully
","This is an imaginative film that uses the much beaten flashback technique in an unusual way -- as part of a TV competition. The direction is first rate and clearly deserves the Oscar that it got. The acting is also very good, the youngest Jamal and Salim emerging as absolute gems. Main actor Dev Patel is excellent if a bit static at times, seeming constantly puzzled by events around him (then again, had I won 20 million rupees I'd probably look puzzled too! And with a beauty like that to share it with...) The photography is of a very high caliber indeed and it helps convey an image of India that reflects its physical beauty but also reveals many of its shortcomings, especially from a human standpoint. The film laudably does not shy away from depicting the ways children are used, including maiming them so they are more valuable as potential beggars. I was not so sure about the brothers symbolizing the division between Muslims and Hindus but all credit to the film for raising it. Slumdog Millionaire boasts some sound action sequences -- the one involving Salim killing Maman is particularly well done if hard to swallow -- and, in contrast, some fine comic relief moments that help make it a riveting flick throughout. I saw some reviews that compared it to 'City of Angels' - Cidade de Deus -, in some cases calling it a copy of that Brazilian film. In truth, I think the point of contact between the two films is that they happen in the slums of their respective cities, otherwise they differ, principally in terms of character building and narrative technique.Ultimately, I felt I had watched an engrossing and intelligent film that provided an exciting example of globalization and cooperation across cultural boundaries and which might well serve as a blueprint for the future of movie-making.",8,3,5,2 April 2009
