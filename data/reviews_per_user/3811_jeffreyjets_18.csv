The Avengers," Best Superhero Movie!
","It pains me to say that because I was a Spiderman fan growing up and Spiderman started off this Superhero crazed movie run with what was the best movie. What made Spiderman stand apart was that it was a great movie and a great Superhero movie. Well, move over because Avengers did most everything right enough to at least have a discussion of whether Spiderman 1 or Avengers 1 was the better movie. It might have helped that I do not know the Avenger lore as well as I knew others, but everyone else is in agreement. I am reluctant about this statement, because you hear something is the best ever and then it never lives up. I read a lot of hype in these pages before I went and saw it. Now I have seen it and must agree with the hype.One thing I was afraid of: Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, which I am a little still out on, but I do like Mark Ruffalo, but made Bruce Banner a little too weak/effeminate. It comes together nicely though. Another was ScarJo. Yes, she is sexy enough(understatement) but was she athletic enough to carry it out and she did well enough. Another problem, the bravado/'egos' of the characters, not stars, but characters of such a movie would demand a lot of screen time for each one to make this work. That would be a problem if it was not accomplished. The movie was very good on this point. Cobie, Robin from How I met Your Mother, was a bit of a distraction for me in a secondary role, but did a competent job. The most interesting thing for me was that Joss Whendon was Director and Writer. He created Buffy/ Angel, Firefly/Dollhouse. I wondered how he would do with such mainstream fair and he managed to bring everything together almost perfectly. I say almost because there is one bit that is missing. It is somewhat minor, but who taught Bruce Banner the secret to control his angry green side. That is the only piece missing for me.For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well.I think you will enjoy this movie, unless you only enjoy completely realistic movies.",10,6,11,5 May 2012
Mission: Impossible III," 1 better story. 2 better action. 3 still good
","Not groundbreaking, but still very good. 1 was a better story. 2 had better/more action with IMPOSSIBLE flamboyant stunts. 3 story seems to be a rehash of 2. The Woman Ethan loves in peril and he needs to save. If possible story wise, this movie would had made a better 2 and 2 would have made a better 3. The geographical locations and the operations at each place greatly aided in keeping the movie interesting.Cruise was Cruise so you know what you get there. Philip Seymour Hoffman was a great bad guy, but they did not let him flesh out the badness. His character was a little too matter of fact. As he is, he still was the best bad guy of the series. He did a lot with the little he had. Keri Russell was believable as an action character and with the characters' relationship set-up with Ethan, they could have done more with Keri Russell's character in terms of adding action/story. Michelle Monaghan did well and performed probably the most impossible stunt in the movie by trusting her man at times when it was obvious that everything about him was a lie. Ving and the rest of the ops crew added believability to it.Overall Mission Impossible 3 is satisfying as movie, but I think it would be OK to wait for DVD and buy all 3 movies.",8,0,0,15 May 2006
Marie Antoinette," Very well done except...
","Almost all aspects of Marie were pitch perfect. Directing, acting, political backdrop, costumes, sets designs and photography were spot on. The only problem, which to me is a major problem is the choice of the pervasive cheesy 80's pop music. I think the choice was made, because the music itself is viewed as superficial and plastic, which for a 14 year old queen would be a fairly representation. As for me, I do not appreciate the aspects of this music so it was completely annoying and out of place to me. Perhaps, a better technique would have been to play the popular cheesy 80's pop music in the instruments of the time period. That would have made the artful statement much more arty and effective, not to mention much less repulsive. The only other drawback is that the story stop right when historically Marie Antoinette got a stronger backbone. That would have made for a very interesting character transformation. Good as is, but could have been much more enjoyable. I should also state that Kirsten Dunst is one of my favorites, so I am a little biased since I enjoy seeing her on screen.",8,2,3,29 July 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Good, but has issues
","I rated this an 8. I can see why other's would rate it less, but first the good points. Same cast and character's have not worn out their welcome. They are still on target with the acting and their characters. The new ones only add to the fun. The story and plot is fast paced. Photography is phenomenal. The bad guys and concepts thereof are well done and scary. Also something that I found fun was that there were some setting that were not particularly great, but I like it because they reminded me of the ride at Disney World.I enjoyed this movie very much until the end. Also, you should know I would rate the Black Pearl as a 10. One of the things that to me added substance to the original was that in the end, it turned out that Jack actually did have a plan even though he appeared loosey goosey. This had none of that.Second, they resolved nothing. It is a Part I. Personally, I like to know ahead of time that this is the case, so the disappointment level is set. They could have resolved almost every point before the bug ending and the new movie have plot points of its own. On this point, I find the movie lazy and almost irrelevant, but it is a fun ride.For the parents: There are some scary jumpy times. There are some grisly killings that are not too graphic, but the concept and actions is made well known. I think its PG13 rating is well warranted for this movie.",8,1,3,16 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Much Better than 2
","The third installment is much more engrossing than 2. The only reason that I didn't like 2 was that none of the story lines were wrapped-up. Everything was left for 3, which I felt was very lazy story writing.Anyways about 3, The 3 hours were over before I knew it. The acting was great. The finishing of the story lines was very satisfying with no real cliffhanger. The action was fun and the cheesy fun was entertaining. 2 of my 3 kids liked it better than Spidey 3.No blood at all even with all the sword play. The only improvement in story is they could have done more with Calypso.As good as it is, 3 isn't as good as the 1st(but what film is), but much more satisfying than 2. I am not even sure if you need to see 2 for 3.",10,5,8,5 June 2007
American Hustle," A Very Good Movie, but not decent
",I'd really give it an 8.5 but closer to 9 than to 8. This isn't All The President's Men or a movie in love with itself. The statement read 'Some of the following events actually occurred' instead of Based on actual events. That should tell you what you need to know about the tone of the movie. Apparently 1980 girls cuss like a sailor and dress like sluts. It is humorous. Someone said correctly 'It was a caricature of actual events.' Cooper's character is over the top which makes it more fun. I recommend if you don't mind heavy swearing.Overall a fun movie. Everyone played their part well. The story is interesting.,9,0,2,27 March 2014
Man of Steel," It was a good movie, just not a good Superman movie
","I don't think that my spoilers are too much plot related, but I want to warn you just in case. OK, maybe one, but it ruin a good portion of the romance. For me, I did not like the changes. You might. The changes take almost all the fun out of Superman. For all I know some comic book writer has written another version of Superman where Lois Lane knows that Clark Kent and Superman are one in the same. Very much ruins a good portion of the fun of Superman. The guy who plays Superman is a dead ringer for Tom Welling, only thinner and less well-adapted Tom Welling. I guess this Superman's Parents were not able to help him grow. While I am a fan of Amy Adams, I think a poor choice for Lois Lane - blonde haired and too cute nose. Superman spent the whole movie with a furled angry brow. Kudos to Kevin Costner for getting his best role ever...being married to Diane Lane, not being Superman's father. Diane Lane is probably the only person in a role for which she is perfect. Of course, then, Diane Lane is perfect in every way. Not a big fan of Crowe being Jarel, although he did OK and I like Crowe, just not that role.This movie was a lot like The Dark Knight for me...I don't like Bale as Batman, Maggie Gylenhal at all and don't like want they did to the Joker, on the other hand, the story and movie was phenomenal, I just had to convince myself that it was not a Batman movie. Man of Steel was wrong in most of the same ways, unfortunately, where the Dark Knight story just kept getting better as the movie progressed, Man of Steel was too long with meaningless fighting - about 15 minutes could have been cut.(Yes, I understand that the build up was to show mercy before...you know, but it could have been handled better.)In short (too late!), this is not your Father's Superman and that may be OK with you, but it is a decent movie, if you can get past the changes. Overall, I may have given the movie an 8.5 if it wasn't called the Man of Steel.",6,0,4,29 June 2013
Divergent," very good but issues
","Movie itself was good. Story, plot, directing and editing....however, a few problems for me. Everyone was cast very good and looked fine except, I didn't buy Shailene as tough for a moment. Sure she could go for fearless, tough? Take a punch tough? Not even close. A different problem but same vein, she spends 18 years of her life with no training, but in 10 weeks she rules. Guess that's the book, but lame. AND the big one, they just win. Knock out plan. People who would support them are standing around with guns, they could take control but decide to run...really? Overall it is a very enjoyable movie if you handle a few holes.",8,2,14,27 March 2014
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Very Good
","Just saw this on DVD. It isn't the type of movie that I want to see on the BIG screen. The big screen to me is made for big block buster special effects movies. For movies of a more personal rom-com nature that could be really good, bland or stupid I prefer a smaller price tag. I do have to say that of I saw this in the theater, I would not have been disappointed and consider my money well spent. This movie is a creative imaginative out there kind of movie and it really hit me on most cylinders. Being that it is off-beat, not all people are going to appreciate it. I found it very funny and it was done in a comic book fashion that took a minute to get with the program. The dialogue was interesting and the plot unfolded well. The actors helped the movie in that they had the ability to make believe they were serious, even if the whole movie was not serious. It is a key ingredient to movies like these. There was only one that over played their part and that was G-man. I have only one issue with the movie and that is the ending. Afterall that it would seem Scott would be a bit more assured of himself.",8,2,7,17 December 2010
The Princess Bride," In My Top 3 favorite Movies
","This is one one my top 3 favorite movies. It is a funny solid fairy tale adventure that will delight many for generations to come. It is funny, silly and hilarious. The script was so well put together and the actors deliver the lines so believably tight that it was an immediate masterpiece for those who like this genre. It's charm lies in the strong characters all the way around and the supporting cast is phenomenal.I do have to say that for smaller children there are a couple of scenes besides kissing that they may not want to see or the parents may not want them to see. You may want to see it first and judge at what age you want you",10,0,1,17 June 2006
2012," Great American Cheesy Fun!
","I was so very glad that it wasn't a preachy global warming flick. I liked this movie for a few reasons that are not good reasons. 1.)Great graphics, mostly. Great to see California fall off into ocean..now that I am not living there. 2.) Like John Cusack and finally liked Amanda Peet in a movie and the kids were great. 3.) I did like like Oliver Platt and the way they handled the attempts to keep the secret. 4.) I want to be Charlie (Woodley Harrelson's character.) That was a good role for him and he played it perfectly. Iagree that there was an Indiana Jones Adventure feel to the stunts chases and such, but that's what made it fun for me. I think it was headed for a 5 or 6 rating until the end action moments and they picked it up to a 7, although I liked it more than a 7, I don't think the movie as a whole is better than that. The cheesiest moment came towards the end with the not open/do open door speech.Overall, it was good cheesy fun, which may not be what you want in a world will be destroyed movie, but it tries to take itself serious at times.",7,2,2,9 March 2010
The Hurt Locker," Retreaded War Plot
","It took me a while to find a reason that the Oscars would embarrass itself by lifting up a movie to the 'highest heights' that is barely worth a footnote. This movie is nothing really new. You have seen this all before. The characters, plot and action is in every other war movie...big budget or not. OK, the acting is fine and writing was OK, but the plot was sad irresponsible for an independent movie. It was OK until the soldiers veered far away from their duties by running down allies they had no business being in. The only thing I think Hollywood was interested in was that the main character, the hero/protagonist is there not to serve or defend his country, but to serve his own adrenaline craving. In the end, there is something selfishly wrong with the hero and that has Hollywood all excited. How warped and sad that Hollywood denigrates their own award shows to lift up the liberal bias.",3,11,18,9 March 2010
In Time," Good Movie. GREAT Concept!
","Enjoyed just about everything about this movie. I was so mesmerized by the plot and the oddities of subtle economic changes. The changes in behavior are seen as problems by others. I mean if your length of life is dependent upon what you buy, I think less people would have phones. The acting is good. Made you think about choices and felt a little preachy, but it was a decent sermon.Justin was great and Amanda is always awesome. I imagine some of the good parts ended on the editing floor. It was really creepy how young Justin's mom appeared.Overall I do recommend In Time, however the economic applications to current economy is limited.",8,0,0,27 March 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A good Sequel
","The first one was great and this was a good sequel, which in my thought means that it was as good as the first. Given you have seen it before. I loved that the cast was back and in the same form. I wish they would have done more with Josh Duhamel and his crew. Could have done without Megan Fox straddling the motorcycle like white-trash. I have a teen girl and 2 pre-teen boys and not part of the story. Yes, Megan Fox is phat, but phat can be classy as well.The story was good and had plot holes like fantasy movies always have, but it was fun, fast and exhilarating. It always amazes me when people watch a movie about things that don't exist and think it doesn't make sense.Except for the Turturro part of the story, there was less humor and the little robots were not very funny.",8,11,19,21 July 2009
Edge of Tomorrow," Did no one see Source Code?
","I see all these comparisons to groundhog Day, but did no one see Source Code? If you did not see Source Code, you should. More Dectective Crime story the Edge, but brilliant FX's as well. Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise...no getting around him, but his movie budget, stories and secondary characters/actors are awesome. Edge is no different.The storyline and plot were good. At times they seem to be taking a little too long with somethings and could have been more time on others, but that could be just me. At times, surprising humor in places you are not expecting. The only draw back in the movie was the very last scene, but my son loved it.I recommend it if you like Tom Cruise movies. If yo don't like Tom Cruise movies, see Source Code.",8,1,3,12 July 2014
August Rush," Sweetest Movie I have seen in years
","August Rush is quite simply one of the best movies I have seen in years. I loved that it dealt with tough subjects of life along with an endearing faith in hope and they do it without all the harsh language and cheap thrills of sex. The acting, storyline, direction and cinematography are very good with special mention for Robin Williams, Terence Howard and Keri Russell. The music, of course, is the highlight. The score is always interesting and integrating the stories of the main characters together. They did use the technique of time line jumping for a period of time, jumping back and forth in time, which does annoy some people. Young and old really enjoy this movie and the music. I have no idea how it didn't win an award for best score.",10,3,5,4 April 2010
Bruce Almighty," A Good Romantic Comedy
","This was never designed to be more than an entertaining, sweetly uplifting movie. There have been many movies that attempt this genre and many have failed. Bruce exceeds at both the comedy and the romance, eventually. The comedy is a given since it has Jim Carey in it as long as you find him funny. I know 1 or 2 that do not. The romantic part is supplied by the one of the most gorgeous woman alive who has perfected pouting lips. (Still don't understand Brad's choice.) Bruce does go the extra effort to illicit misty eyes from most of the viewers.It could have been better, if it had used the more than capable supporting cast more effectively. Unfortunately, the storyline does not allow for close friends, since Carey's character is self centered and self pitying.",8,0,2,6 June 2007
Thor: The Dark World," Superhero movies pale compare to Avengers, but Thor good
","Everything Superhero related now pales compared to the Avengers, but I thought it came close to an 8...7.75. If this movie came before Avengers, then it would be a 9, better than Iron Man 2 or 3 easily. Acting superb, story line great with just a touch of seen that already. This has exceptional action, good heart, good sad and a good bad. The humor was about 65% on, but I think the 35% that didn't hit was dry smirking humor, which is good for me. I do think the 2ndary Aasgard fighters or Thor's posse could have been used in the final battle against the other elves and that probably would have made it a 8.5 - 9.0 straight out.The disclosure is that Thor was my 2nd fav superhero growing up behind Spiderman so it would be hard for me not to like it, OVERALL IT WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING MOVIE.",8,1,5,16 November 2013
