The Blair Witch Project," A seriously creepy movie
","Very few horror movies, in my opinion, are genuinely scary.There are a lot of gross-outs, a lot of blood-baths, and a lot of attempts to push back the shock barrier (you know, 'I've never seen anything as gross as -that- before!'),  but personally none of them really scare me particularly.They just aren't believable, so all the buckets of blood and climactic gross-outs are just a waste of ketchup.The people in them don't talk or behave the way real people talk, the premises are (mostly) unexplained and unbelievable.Imagine you're in a car wreck on an untravelled road.  One minute you're driving along, the next you're in shock lying on the side of the road, pinned under your car, horribly injured, dying.Really, it's the scariest f___ing thing imaginable.  Knowing there's nothing you can do, you're going to die.The Blair Witch Project is scary like that;  genuinely f___ing scary.",10,1,2,24 July 1999
I Am Legend," Flashy creature movie with no resemblance to the original
","The write-up by csullaf (http://www.imdb.com/user/ur0814462/comments) titled 'Extravagant wrapping around an empty box., 17 December 2007' already said most of what needed to be said about this movie, in my opinion, but I wanted to add a little bit.As he said, I find it mind-boggling how quickly Hollywood will make a movie based on a story or earlier movie and end up with something that bears little resemblance to the original. It's the height of stupidity. The REASON people want a new version is because of the original, if you take that away, you have nothing left, do you? Which is what this movie has, as far as I'm concerned. There's just nothing there. Video-game monsters, poorly-developed characters and poorly-developed plot.What really gets me more than anything else though ... again, as csullaf said, the changes they made, absurdly, make the title meaningless.In the original and in earlier filmed versions, the vampires are fairly intelligent. And the main character is a legend to them, THUS THE NAME, 'I am Legend'.In fact in the earliest filmed version of this, the Vincent Price version, if I recall correctly the female character who he befriends turns out to be sort of a mutant strain of the vampires, more or less half-human and half-vampire. As a result, you really do see it from their point of view. They are the future of the human race, a new mutation (the vampires in general) and from that perspective, the main character IS in fact a monster in his own right.That's what makes the story interesting. That's what makes it any different from a thousand cheesy monster movies or, for that matter, from a video game.But by making the vampires super-powered video game monsters, that whole side of it is lost.And there's nothing left but a video game.I really have never been able to grasp how they do it, how they take an interesting story and, at some point, make the decision 'let's take everything that is interesting in this story and chuck it out'. I mean they couldn't just be doing it accidentally, could they? I would just like to see the meeting where they do that. Are they all doing massive amounts of cocaine so they are all in some cocaine psychosis and then they have the meeting? Maybe they can make that a mandatory special feature on the DVD for movies like this in the future. 'The meeting where we decided to take everything good and chuck it out'. I think that would be good cinema, I would like to see a roomful of coked-up Hollywood executives barking and howling like madmen and making completely deranged decisions. And they probably have some pretty cute secretaries.It wouldn't be any better than the movie they end up making but it would at least be shorter.",4,0,0,2 May 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A good movie. A very good movie. But not the 83rd best movie ever made.
","I don't go to movies in the theatre very often anymore. I have a nice big-screen TV and DVD player and most of the time I watch movies like that.So when I do go to the theatre I try to make sure it's a very good movie. The IMDb is a big part of that, I have found generally the IMDb median rating for a movie is a dependable indicator of whether I will like it or not.So I pulled a list of movies playing at the local theatre and fed them into IMDb. Gran Torino and Benjamin Button both had very, very high ratings. Benjamin Button was slightly higher ... and it really needed to be, as I saw it was nearly three hours long. At the time it was something like the #78 highest rated movie of all time in IMDb.I didn't even know very clearly what it was about, but to me it doesn't matter, either a movie is good or bad, whatever genre it's in.So I chose Benjamin Button. I had very high expectations for it, I was really expecting to see a movie that deserved to be rated the 78th (currently 83rd) best movie ever made.There is nothing I think is -bad- about it. The acting is all good, the story is engaging. The movie did draw me in emotionally at times.But there was just nothing stunningly good about it. I can't think of a scene that struck me as being a GREAT scene, a scene that really moved me or amazed me or touched me.Overall I thought the characters were good. Good, not great. The device of having him aging backwards worked, I thought, personally. I'm still not sure why, but there was something touching about watching him grow ever younger, especially as a part of the love affair which was the center of the movie. (And some of my favorite scenes were the ones in the beginning with Benjamin as a very young old man ... to me that was very humorous.) Watching the young/old Benjamin fall in love with the young Daisy was kind of wonderfully strange and touching. (Although, as another reviewer here pointed out, there was also something vaguely creepy about that, in a sort of vaguely pedophilic way.) To me it was all GOOD. Very good, quite possibly.But I could never really call any of it GREAT. I mean if there is somebody reading this who, like me before I saw it, is trying to decide whether to see this movie or not, that's my conclusion. If you want to see a good movie, watch it. But if you really want to see a stunning, great movie, I don't think Benjamin Button is there.I've said i don't think it's great, but I haven't really said much about why.After I saw the movie I looked through other people's IMDb reviews and I found one which I thought hit the nail on the nail.I don't think there is a way to link directly to an IMDb review but it was posted on 15 December 2008 and the title is 'Fine-looking and well acted, but ultimately flat'.In a lot of ways I would like to just point at that review and say 'I agree'.As that reviewer says, Benjamin himself is basically a very emotionally flat character. And he's utterly the heart of the movie, so as a result the movie is very unengaging. Because Benjamin has no evident emotions, one doesn't care about what happens to him.Which is such a waste when you have Brad Pitt as an actor. I think it's a shame that Pitt has not, like Johnny Depp, insisted on roles that would give him a chance to show what he can do, because I just can't believe that somebody who could do what he did in Twelve Monkeys is not capable of genius work. But definitely, Pitt is great when he can stretch out and be wild. Exactly the opposite of Benjamin Button.For what it's worth, I can understand a lot of why the character is the way it is. I mean I'm not going to sit here and say the film-maker is an idiot, I think I get what he was going for.TCCOBB is, I think, intended to be a lot like Forrest Gump. Not so much a movie about the character as about the times in which he lived.So I think Benjamin is so neutral because he's supposed to be a neutral, Forrest Gump-style observer. He's watching the times go by, and we are watching them through his eyes.But the thing is, while I can see the logic of it, the fact remains that we wind up with an emotionally dead, unengaging movie.But unlike FG, I don't think TCCOBB does all that great a job of making me feel like I am living through the times Benjamin is living through.Most of the scenes feel, to me, like they could be transplanted to modern times without anything being lost.One thing I will say in favor of the film on that point though, I loved their choices of period music. There was one moment in a restaurant during which a Stephane Grappeli/Django Reinhardt tune plays, set in the 30s I think, which I particularly liked. And the Beatles on TV.But it did not do a great job of capturing a feeling of the times.And in trying to do so, it sacrificed emotional engagement.A good movie, but in my opinion, far from a great one.",7,0,1,26 January 2009
Ran," A thought about the ending, to mr_sboub
","I know comments aren't supposed to comment about other comments ... this isn't meant to be a thread but I found mr_sboub's thought interesting and it was running through my head while I watched Ran tonight.Saburo's death was predictable, and perhaps (as you seem to say) gratuitous. In a way this is certainly true, Kurosawa embraces the tragic, maybe to excess.  (The only 'happy ending' I can think of in a Kurosawa film is Yojimbo).There is an interesting parallel though, which adds depth to Saburo's death.The snipers are an afterthought.  Jiro orders them out, then basically forgets all about them.  He is already high-tailing it to the castle when they catch up to their target (actually, I think he might be on the verge of seppuku at that point, I don't remember).This is very very similar to the burning of the peasant village earlier in the movie.  Hidetora orders a peasant village burned, for completely stupid reasons.  He is quickly talked out of it ... but nobody ever thinks to cancel the order.  Later, somebody mentions ... 'hey, do you smell something?'.  There is no further explanation of this line ... it is the peasant village, burning.  They forgot.This is Kurosawa humor, very very dark humor.Personally, I think the shooting of Saburo was intentionally a parallel to this earlier moment.  Seen that way, Hidetora is definitely getting a karma moment.His (Hidetora's) own death, I agree, is kind of just thrown in there, but if you see the link between his crimes and Saburo's death, and that Saburo's death lead to his, it makes a little more sense.Dark dark humor indeed.",Null,1,3,28 May 2003
