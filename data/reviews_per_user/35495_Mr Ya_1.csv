The Blair Witch Project," What a waste of time!
","I rented this movie without reading any reviews first, I didn't want to be influenced by the media hype.  Now I am left trying to figure out if everyone else that talked about this movie in the first few months watched the same one I did.  I thought it was poorly acted, terribly filmed, with an even worse plot!I am glad that I didn't waste $8.00 by seeing it at the theatre.  Not only was it incredibly boring (I nearly fell asleep) but I was also suffering from terrible motion sickness by the time it was over.I have spent enough time camping in the woods to know it can be frightening. But give me a break.  If you are that terrified and truly in danger, drop the camera and follow the river out of the damn woods!",1,3,6,11 January 2000
