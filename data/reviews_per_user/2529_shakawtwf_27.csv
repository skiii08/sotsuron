Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I didn't want to like this movie
","I was concerned that this would be simply another 'Latka Gravas from Taxi' character where the humor is solely derived from mispronouncing words and speaking broken English.But it turned out to be very much more than that.I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the other people in the movie (regular citizens, men and women on the street) weren't in on the joke (at least they didn't appear to be). This gave the movie a dynamic that I didn't expect.I must add however that because of this I found the movie EXTREMELY difficult to watch in large sections. I had to pause it repeatedly whenever Borat would walk up to someone and kiss them on the cheek or when he said or did something (unintentionally) inappropriate. It was like watching a series of train wrecks. You couldn't watch but you couldn't look away either.A couple of the lines made me laugh out loud ('My wife's vagine now looks like a wizard sleeve'). When he said that his mother was the oldest woman in the country and that she was 43, I laughed at that for about five minutes.The less said about the scene with him and his friend in that hotel room the better (but it was funny). There were extra scenes on the DVD that I started watching but I just couldn't continue. All in all I thought it was a good movie just a very difficult one to watch.",8,0,6,16 April 2007
Star Trek," Liked it quite a bit, didn't love it
","As I get older, there are two things that can derail a movie for me: extreme excess (i.e. too much) and poorly-explained plot points (i.e. too little).I liked the movie quite a bit, I thought the actors were great (Bones and Scotty especially) and the action scenes were exciting.I was concerned when I saw the Romulan ship at the beginning, it wasn't just big, it was the biggest, meanest, pointiest, sharpest, least cuddly ship that ever existed. When I see something like this, I get worried because I think the whole movie is going to be like this, i.e. overblown and excessive to the nth degree. Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' was like that and I hated it.Fortunately, the movie DIDN'T proceed along those lines, it didn't just rely totally on just being excessive. For the first time, we get to meet the characters that we've known for 40 years and it was fun to see them as younger people.The plot point that I found poorly explained was when older Spock shows up. He tells us about an attempt to help the Romulans that results in the destruction of their planet (causing Spock and Nero's ship to be pulled back in time, thereby starting everything that we've already seen). I didn't understand any of the red matter/black hole stuff. Spock's explanation was raced through, quickly dashed-off and felt shoehorned. If I were able to rewind it and hear it again, that would have been helpful.The divergences from the Star Trek universe that we've always known bothered me too. Uhura and Spock making out so much. Traditionally Spock was conflicted about his dual nature, he was always trying to keep his emotions in check. Here he's a light switch: completely logical one minute, completely emotional the next. Just because the Romulans went back in time and changed Kirk's life, there's no reason it would necessarily have any affects on Spock. The other things that bothered me were Vulcan being destroyed and Spock's mother dying. If they don't fix these things in the next movie, I'm going to be very cross. :) Repeated viewings might fix a lot of the problems I had with the movie. But if the audience doesn't understand the story you're trying to tell the first time, it's probably not the audience's fault.Update (11/18/09): I watched this again last night and I DID like it better than the first time (I was able to follow the story better without any pre-conceptions) however what bothered me the first time still bothers me now.Spock Prime's actions with the red matter didn't cause Romulus's destruction, couldn't have prevented it and were completely unnecessary. The script requires him to release the red matter so he and Nero can go back in time but Nero's need for revenge is completely baseless since Spock didn't cause Romulus's destruction.Young Spock's behavior with Uhura is just completely out-of-character. In TOS, Spock's emotional outbursts were lapses of logic not an integrated part of his personality. His behavior would not be affected whatsoever by Nero going back in time and changing Kirk's life.If Spock Prime was close enough to witness the destruction of Vulcan from Delta Vega, wouldn't that outpost be sucked in by the singularity too? It was all too convenient that Spock, Kirk and Scotty would have all been on the same outpost at the same time. I doubt that Young Spock would have jettisoned Kirk onto that moon anyway.The problem the first time was that these thoughts were preventing me from seeing other nuances that were good. On second viewing, it was an imperfect story told well.",5,1,6,28 May 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," After watching it 1-1/2 times.....
","The story is really kind of all over the place. Everyone's plans seem to hinge on things they can't control or someone else that they don't trust and can't possibly know what their real intentions are.The admiral: why keep Khan's people alive? To control him? A guy who can transport across light years isn't controllable. His vision to militarize Starfleet doesn't resonate for the audience because we don't know why he wants this nor are we made to care.Khan: why put his own people into the admiral's warheads? Does he know that the admiral will get the Enterprise to fire them at him on Qo'Nos? Are they supposed to land gently on the surface so he can revive them then? If he has access to them in the first place, revive them and be on your merry way.The admiral KNOWS Khan put his people in the warheads, I just don't understand what anybody's motives are in this movie.That nonsense in the beginning with the volcano: why submerge the Enterprise when you don't have to? 'They (the natives) saw the Enterprise!' They were going to eventually unless you planned to keep it underwater forever, it has to come up at some time! The scene with Kirk, Spock and Uhura felt real and I actually really liked it and found it touching but Kirk's death was phoned in. Not moving in any way at all like the one from 'Wrath of Khan'.If JJ Abrams feels the need to reinvent Star Trek, perhaps he should stop scavenging on the older version's carcass and come up with an original thought. I know he's capable of it.",3,6,9,18 September 2013
Finding Nemo," Wonderful, wonderful movie!!
","I walked into this movie expecting a lot and it came through big time! I loved the distinct personalities given to each of the animals, the sharks with Australian accents, the lobsters using New England jargon, the 'surfing' turtles using California surfer lingo. Caricatures, to be sure, but very funny ones.You really cared about Nemo and the relationship with his Dad (everyone can relate to a little boy and his Dad trying to find each other). Definitely one to get on DVD (you have to watch it several times to get all of the inside jokes, which I'm sure I missed a lot of!)Go see it with someone you love and have a great time!",10,0,0,31 May 2003
Constantine," Interesting beginning but horrible ending(s)
","I have little tolerance for movies that begin well and end poorly. (I have far greater tolerance for movies that start shakily and end well.) 'Constantine' was one of those movies that made me feel that it didn't know what it wanted to be about. Or it had too many ideas and didn't feel confident to run with any of them so it tried to use them all.We have Constantine who is an exorcist dying of lung cancer. Okay, that's a little different. We have Rachel Weisz whose twin sister dies suspiciously. Okay. We have the two of them meeting ostensibly to find out what happened to the sister. Fine. These are the salient points of the movie as I see them however at the end of the movie, we seem to have false ending after false ending involving the son of the devil and Gabriel and going to Hell and we have the Mexican gentleman carrying that Sword around. Maybe I wasn't paying attention but who were all of those people in the mental institution that Keanu killed? Apparently they were demons but I didn't see an explanation for their presence. They were just there and then they were killed.The one gaping flaw in the logic of this movie is that Constantine considers himself damned without chance of salvation because as a teenager he attempted suicide. The thing of it is is that he didn't succeed which gives him the opportunity to ask for forgiveness. Gabriel tells him at the beginning of the movie that his situation is hopeless (although he/she uses a different phrase). If Constantine wants to be saved, he simply has to ask for forgiveness. Period.This renders all of his actions in the movie unnecessary (if they are, in fact, being done in order to save him).",3,0,15,20 February 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Not as good as you've heard. . .
","I don't regret seeing the movie, the scenery was beautiful, but I found the relationship between Jack and Ennis unconvincing. The passage of time that they spent together early in the movie was simply slow-moving (in fact the whole movie moved slowly) and then their first time together seemed to happen too fast and was overly violent.The script required them to get married to women, have children and then largely ignore their families in favor of their relationship. You feel bad for Ennis's wife when she sees the two men together; you can understand her shock but it all seems a little too by-the-numbers.One glaring issue that I spent too much time paying attention to was that the two men don't realistically age. Their children age and Anne Hathaway's wigs get bigger and poufier but apart from some hardly-noticeable wrinkles around their eyes, they don't seem to get older. Perhaps if a better makeup job was done, the audience would more feel the passage of years that they spent together.A touching movie might be made on this subject but I didn't feel that this was it.",6,4,36,12 February 2006
Spider-Man 3," It wasn't bad but.....
","I thought the movie's finale tied up the disparate elements together pretty well but I did find problems with the main body of the film. The singing and dancing scenes were completely wrong; they weren't so much a new direction to take the movies in as they made the movie feel like it was just getting lost; they made it feel like another movie interrupted this one.CGI notwithstanding, I didn't find the Sandman character a very intriguing villain (but I did like the scene with him at the end when he was in human form). Wouldn't that science experiment that he just tumbled onto have been better protected? Yes, there was razor wire but it just seemed to happen too easy.I'm not a fan of the comic books so I was confused about Venom. Venom is black goop, Venom is the black suit, Venom is an alien, first he's Peter, then he's this other guy. When Peter and Venom became separated and Venom went to that other guy, I thought it started getting interesting again.Throughout the last two movies, I have just grown tired of Harry Osborne's whining about his father's death. Peter finally says the sentence that should have been said long ago 'Your father caused his own death' which is corroborated by the butler.On the up side, I thought Bryce Dallas Howard was just stunning.I thought it was okay, lots of action scenes, a few too many things going on, Sandman was underdeveloped, too much singing and dancing but it was okay.",7,0,0,19 May 2007
The Polar Express," I just didn't get it - in 3-D! - SPOILERS
","I had never read or even heard of the book before I saw the first preview a few months ago so I went into this movie with an open mind, not really any expectations.I saw it today in IMAX 3-D and just watched and watched and watched, looked at my watch, and then watched the movie some more. I just didn't get it. The movie wasn't really boring, I just didn't understand the premise (or the potential that anyone saw in the premise). I had less problem with the execution of the story than with the story itself.{SPOILER WARNING}A train picks up some kids and then proceeds to the North Pole. Is the train real or is it imaginary? How can a train go down the street where there are no tracks? What tracks are it traveling on during the entire trip? If the train is imaginary, why does it seem subject to physical laws and why is it manned by such incompetents?The main kid character doesn't believe in Santa Claus and by the end he does. I didn't feel the moment of revelation. At no time did I feel anything for anyone in this movie, not even the lonely little boy. I didn't understand who the hobo on the roof of the train was supposed to be.To convert what is supposed to be a 15 page book into a 90 minute movie, one would think that you would have ample time to explain everything in the book and have time to spare.(12/18/04) - I read the book in the bookstore today (took me a minute) and I have to say that it is v-e-r-y slight source material for a movie (however most of what irritated me about the movie isn't in the book. It's okay that I don't know who the hobo is; the author doesn't either). I just don't understand what the hulla-balloo is all about.",2,1,8,12 December 2004
Lost in Translation," Utterly boring
","Like a lot of people, I rented this based on all of the hype. I only made it through 45 minutes but based on other people's feedback, another hour wouldn't have made a difference.I started watching and knew very shortly thereafter that this movie was not going well. Bill is bored, Scarlett is bored and so am I. I don't empathize with Bill because, even though he's away from home, he's earning two million dollars in one week making a commercial. I don't empathize with Scarlett because, even though her husband is busy a lot, she seems to have plenty of friends and chooses to spend most of her time alone. If they are bored, why shouldn't I be as well watching them? The humor seems to derive from the basest concepts. 'It's funny hearing Japanese people speak English and it's even funnier to hear Bill Murray not understand Japanese'. A Causcasian person intentionally mocking a Japanese person's speech may not be PC but it can be pretty funny. To show Japanese people speaking English badly and someone misunderstanding isn't. Is that the height of humor in this movie? That some Japanese people have trouble with English? I don't care about these two people; their boredom and loneliness don't mean anything to me because they don't mean anything to me. I don't care when they meet and are bored together.I've read critics and viewers talk about the 'chemistry between the actors' and how the movie captured the feeling of being alone in a foreign country. For me there was no chemistry and there was really nothing up on the screen to empathize with. I've read comments like 'If you traveled alone in a foreign country, you'd understand.' Well, I have traveled alone in a couple of foreign countries; when I needed to do something, I got up off of my butt and went outside.Movies don't have to be filled with explosions and special effects but I do insist that a movie be about something.",2,2,6,5 May 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Couldn't get through the first half hour
","When I saw the first Matrix, I really thought it was just okay, nothing great, nothing special and was very surprised to hear that there would be two sequels (when one wasn't warranted).I saw 'Matrix Reloaded' in the theater and spent the movie largely lost but the action sorta-kinda kept my interest. What I noticed about that movie most was the pseudo-intellectual, multi-syllabic pablum that was being spewed by the actors (most notably by The Architect).I watched about 25 minutes of 'The Matrix Revolutions' and simply got fed up by the vague half-answers mumbled by The Oracle and the fourteen hundredth gunfight. Maybe I should have watched the previous movie before seeing the next one, maybe there's more there than I am able to see. But I doubt it.",1,0,1,22 February 2005
Meet the Fockers," Two pleasant hours with some old and new friends
","I really enjoyed 'Meet the Fockers'; it wasn't simply a rehash of the first movie but an organic extension of it. Ben Stiller's parents in the movie were a little over the top but completely believable (I've never been a big fan of Babs but she looked great and did a wonderful job and it was nice to see Dustin Hoffman in a comedy again. The two looked like they could have easily been married to each other for 40 years).There were a few cringingly embarrassing moments (which was the desired emotion, I suppose) but all in all a very pleasant two hours spent with old and new friends.",8,0,1,9 January 2005
Ghost Rider," I'm not sure I got it.....
","I did want to see this picture but even from the trailers, I'm not sure I saw the potential of this character. I don't think I understand why a superhero with a flaming head is an interesting concept.There was a lot happening in this movie but it seemed like they couldn't decide on a direction to go so they just decided to go everywhere (and ultimately ending up nowhere). There were too many conflicts, everyone was fighting everyone and no one was on the same team.Nick seemed to be channeling Elvis in his voice; I know he's a fan of Elvis but it's been 30 years and I think we should all say goodbye. I thought Peter Fonda was okay as the devil but he didn't do anything that stood out. Devil Jr. and his three friends seemed like a shoe-horned element. They existed for the sole purpose of being eliminated but there was no need for their existence (I didn't care about the old contract for the souls of the townsfolk, I just didn't). Sam Elliott's crusty old guy was straight out of the Crusty Old Guy manual. The 'surprise' that he was an older Ghost Rider, I guess, was a surprise but I didn't care. He was a plot point to 'help' Nicholas Cage but he doesn't really 'help' him, he just stops being unhelpful when the time comes.Eva Mendes was really the only thing in the movie that I enjoyed watching. She took my breath away in every scene she was in; she was just stunning.I think this movie would have been better if there was more inner conflict with Nick's character (he seemed to accept his lot in life pretty easily, again, the Elvis voice made him seem detached and disinterested), a few less villains and less blowin' stuff up. But blowin' stuff up is what passes for action these days.",5,1,3,21 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Better than the 2nd. one
","I'm not a fan of the X-Men comic books so I don't go into these movies with preconceptions or standards that I'm holding the movies up to. I thought this installment had a compelling story and largely handled the telling of it well.I thought it was much better than 'X-2' which had me scratching my head at its mediocrity and overall lack of action.Kelsey Grammar's Beast was a variation of the Frasier character, a person of class and breeding who can get down and dirty when the situation calls for it. I thought the 'mutant cure being used as a weapon' was a very interesting slant.",8,0,2,29 May 2006
Transformers," Main problem I had with this movie
","The main problem I had with this movie, was that we see battle after battle of machines fighting machines and with the exception of a few instances, we don't really know which side any given machine is on. I couldn't get emotionally involved with a lot of these fight scenes (and I found the story of that cube and its importance kind of incomprehensible or maybe I just didn't care). In a movie like this, the plot is just an excuse to show cars and trucks morphing back and forth into robots. I think it TRIED to be more than what it ended up being but the movie was just too long, taking it's good sweet time getting to the point and ended up being really rather pointless.",6,3,6,18 November 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy," Too much and not enough
","There's a lot of information thrown at you in the beginning, planet names and bad guy names and goody guy names and names and names and names. Fortunately most of this isn't important. All you need to know is that there's an orb that everyone wants (the old McGuffin thing).There's a lot of action in this movie and the characters are unique and funny and that's okay but the main story, 'Everyone wants this orb' was just really underwhelming to me.The stuff in the prison wasn't bad and I liked the escape.Did they need TWO big boss bad guys (Ronan and Thanos)? The conflict with the two sisters was kind of irritating too. Zoe Saldana looked like she just walked off the set of 'Avatar' and was playing the same character.I know a lot of people love the old songs (which were OKAY) but I think the movie's obsession with them was a little distracting. I get it, they remind Quill of his mother, but the tape would have worn out long ago and, truth be told, he'd probably get sick of those songs after 26 years.Vin Diesel and Glenn Close were both kind of wasted in this.It wasn't a BAD movie but there was just so much work put into service of a mediocre story. The same complaint I had of 'Avatar'.",6,4,12,2 August 2014
Avatar," Beautiful but illogical
","I thought the whole point of the story was that they used those Avatars to acclimate with the indigenous people (without them realizing they were dealing with humans). Then when they first go into the forest, they're wearing camouflage and Stanford U T-shirts? Why look like the native people, if you're not going to be dressed like them? The natives obviously know about the 'Sky People' and they don't seem surprised that the newcomers are 'Sky People' and not the same as themselves.I also thought it unlikely that the people and the animals of the planet would ALL evolve with those linkage interfaces (pony-tails). Interesting idea, just didn't think it would happen.If the ruthless military wants the unobtainium (which is a lame name, by the way), stop jerking around and blowing up trees, just kill all of the people and be done with it. If they're gonna drop all of those explosives, it's what they want to see happen anyway, right? Before the scene with the destruction of Hometree, there didn't actually ever seem to be a scene of negotiation for the land. What's the point of the whole Avatar project if not to come to some sort of negotiation? I thought the helicopters looked like Terminator helicopters and I thought those human-control machines looked like the forklift suits in 'Aliens'.It was beautiful to watch (and the battle at the end kinda made up for the other stuff) but I was thinking about all of the inconsistencies throughout the movie.",6,0,1,11 January 2010
Super 8," Another one?
","Is a rampaging monster the only idea that J.J. Abrams has in his head? 'Cloverfield', 'Lost' and now 'Super 8' features one. 'Attention: the big secret in my new movie is the same one I've used over and over again in my other movies!' I didn't think the movie successfully tied together the different threads but my biggest complaint was the monster. If he had never made 'Cloverfield', I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I just couldn't get past the thought that I've seen this all before.I DID think the performances by the kids were really good though. Elle Fanning was just fantastic and I liked her relationship with the boy. I thought Charles got a little annoying saying 'Mint' all of the time (it was a little overuse of the slang of the times). I liked seeing the complete Super 8 movie during the credits.I always like seeing something new; I just can't stand newly packaged old stuff.",5,0,1,1 July 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," Voice of dissent...
","Like some of the other reviewers here, the movie lost me fairly early with the Vikings having Scottish accents (and the kids having American accents). After 'Austin Powers' and 800 Shrek movies and 'Brave', haven't we gotten over the Scottish accent thing? Is that the ONLY accent that we can hear in animated movies anymore? Also, the dragon with the broken tail. The tail shouldn't have prevented him from getting off the ground. STEERING might have been a problem but not the flying part.You had the usual animated movie checklist: the wimpy boy who proves himself to the father who doesn't understand him (and to the local townspeople who make fun of him), the scrappy girl, etc.One cliché after another. I'm tired of seeing the same movie over and over again. I know it's meant for kids and kids grow up to be replaced by other kids who HAVEN'T seen these before, I GET it....",5,3,10,9 June 2014
Mystic River," A very good movie that ends badly
","I felt that the movie was a gripping drama for two hours and then it went on for the last fifteen more minutes which pretty much ruined it for me.The characters suddenly behaved in a manner inconsistent from how they behaved earlier in the movie. Sean Penn's character kills Tim Robbins character based on information from Marcia Gay Harden's character. Kevin Bacon, who seems to be a very honest cop and who was quite prepared to throw Tim Robbins in jail for a murder he suspects Tim committed, looks the other way when he finds out that Sean actually killed Tim. Everyone seems to treat Marcia's character with ostracism at the end for some reason. She thought her husband committed one murder and he actually committed another. She was mistaken but she was completely guiltless of anything, nobody died by her hands but everyone seemed to blame her.Do I understand what was supposed to be depicted on the film at the end or did I miss something? An early scene that bothered me too was when Laurence Fishburne mentions that he stole Tim's car to find some evidence and then Tim is brought in for questioning. A lot of action seemed to have transpired that we weren't privy to. I thought for a minute that a reel was missing in the movie.Without the last fifteen minutes, I probably would have given this movie an 8 or a 9. With it, it's a five at best.",5,3,7,27 January 2005
12 Years a Slave," Dramatically uninvolving
","The movie never quite pulled me in. Each scene was presented and then another one was presented. In spite of the events, Solomon doesn't really seem to have a fire in his belly to escape. There's no real depiction of an escalation of frustration or passion in Solomon.There was also no real indication of time passage either. Twelve years go by, he gets released, his kids are grown. It's almost like for 11 years he looks the same and then when he arrives home, he's got gray hair.Brad Pitt's role was kind of a Deux Ex Machina. Solomon asks for help and it arrives. There was danger for white people helping slaves but here everything goes fine. Solomon tolerates his situation for years and then he asks someone else for help. He never makes a break for it as you would expect.The soundtrack was kind of horrible. Kind of like watching TV while someone is running the vacuum cleaner. You needed to focus more when the soundtrack kicked in.The direction was competent, nothing great. It wasn't like 'Hey Mom, look! I'm a director' where the director tries too hard. The acting wasn't bad. Lupita Nyong'o did a good job. I kind of thought Michael Fassbender was a psychopath, how he could ever have owned a plantation escaped me. Chiwetel Ejiofor was okay, nothing great, something was missing.",4,4,7,11 March 2014
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Not good. . .but then again, I wasn't expecting much
","The following, by themselves, do not necessarily make a funny movie: 1) Funny names 2) Yelling inappropriately 3) Mispronouncing words 4) Non-sequiturs 5) Movies set in the 70'sThere were a couple of funny lines in this movie and they almost made me want to continue watching but I got the gist of the amount of quality that went into the script pretty early. It seems to me that the writers thought they really didn't have to try that hard and that Will Ferrell (who can be very funny, by the way) would just make whatever they wrote funny. A rickety house built on sand doesn't get sturdier with a fresh coat of paint on it.",Null,4,6,16 May 2005
Inception," WAY too long and confusing!
","If you didn't like The Matrix movies, here's more of the same. Movies involving dreams and alternate realities basically set up a world where anything can happen and there are no rules.I LIKE rules. If there were rules here, they were very hard to follow and very shortly into the movie, I just didn't care.Leo's character claims to be the greatest person in the world at delving into people's minds. Then why is he so consistently incompetent at it? His dead wife keeps popping up when she's least welcome, nothing ever goes to plan. The whole plan benefits only Leo, puts everyone else in jeopardy and is built on very shaky ground. Saito says he will fix Leo's problems with one phone call and he's immediately on board? Speaking of the plan, why does implanting a fairly simple idea into another person's head involve blowing everything up in sight? I didn't care about his dead wife. Was she actually dead or did she just die in a dream and is stuck in limbo? I wish *I* was stuck in limbo so I didn't have to think about this movie anymore.Some notes about the actors: I could rarely understand what Ken Watanabe was saying. Ellen Page still looks like she's ten years old and I just didn't accept her in this role. The other guys were okay but I just wasn't invested into anything they were saying or doing.As it has been noted in other reviews, what do I care if this guy Fischer's company is bigger than Saito's or not? 'Let's go through all of this convoluted nonsense because in the future, something bad MIGHT happen?' There's one method of getting him to break up his company that could have been tried and wasn't: Walk up to him and ask him to break up his company. He didn't seem all that ambitious, he didn't seem to care about his father's company. It would have been worth a shot.Part of me kept hoping the plane would crash and it would end the necessity of all this.It's too bad that in a reality where anything can happen, Nolan creates a world where nothing of consequence happens.",3,14,31,18 July 2010
The Big Short," Takes a confusing situation and makes it more so
","I feel this film fails on a number of levels: 1) It centers on a bunch of characters that I couldn't care about. It wasn't so much about what caused the mortgage crisis but about people who took advantage of the crisis to make money for themselves. I didn't understand what they were doing to accomplish this. They were doing 'something' that would make them a lot of money if mortgages failed but I never really understood what that was.2) The frenetic style of the film was disorienting and distracting.3) The asides with famous people explaining things was irritating. And the famous people weren't A-list celebrities, it was like these were the best ones that they could get.4) After being spoon-fed information, I still feel like I didn't understand what they were talking about. (Perhaps I just didn't care.)5) Perhaps if they included how the mortgage crisis affected real people, that might have helped (they showed ONE family leaving in their car but these folks were renters and could move elsewhere). They didn't ACTUALLY lose their own house.6) There's a line from an episode of 'Frasier' where Roz says, 'Throw in a couple of strippers and that still sounds dull'. There were a couple of strippers in this movie for NO good reason and it was still dull.Overall, I found the movie self-indulgent on the director's part ('Hey look ma, I'm a director!') and on the part of the characters. I don't feel I learned anything. And apparently no one involved in the financial world did either.",3,5,13,11 January 2016
X2: X-Men United," Action few a far between
","I thought the movie was good but I was expecting it to be great. There were some actions scenes but they were few and far between.

Godzilla," Unnecessary and boring
","After watching the movie for two hours, I wasn't squirming in my seat waiting for it to end, I was squirming in my seat waiting for something interesting to happen.If someone goes to the trouble to remake a movie, one would think that something new and interesting would be attempted. But the result was 'Giant monsters smashing buildings'. Hasn't it been done before? Like a lot?I went to see this grudgingly, I wasn't paying for the ticket but I just wasn't having fun. Godzilla is expected to save mankind from the MUTO's? Then why does he show up and cause a tsunami that potentially could drown thousands?If he's the military's Plan B to kill the MUTO's, why are they shooting at him? Does no one at the top speak to the troops?They transport a warhead on a train (which gets smashed up) and they ultimately strap it to a helicopter. Couldn't they have just transported it by helicopter in the first place?'Pacific Rim' was way more entertaining than it had to be because there was an interesting human side to the story. Here we have the checklist of the usual clichés:1) The fretting wife 2) The guy that no one believes (the father) 3) His son whose job (bomb defusing) is exactly what is needed (but is never ultimately used). 4) Nameless, faceless masses of people being killedThe 'it's just a movie' people may quibble with such details but if you're going to make 'just a movie', shouldn't it be a good one?",3,1,5,29 May 2014
Fantastic Four," Well done!
","Most of the major critics gave this movie a bad review so from now on I might have to pay them less attention. I thought the movie was really good. I thought inner struggles of each of the characters were well-portrayed (especially Ben/The Thing who has the most to struggle with). I didn't think the special effects were cheesy at all. The story did what it had to: introduce the characters, fill in some information on their respective pasts, give them a situation to deal with (and I thought the way that Dr. Doom was dealt with was very clever) and keep the action moving along. I thought the scene on the Brooklyn Bridge was a little forced but not overly so. All in all a very good movie.",9,20,38,9 July 2005
The Island," Still not sure. . .
","For me this was like watching two different movies. I actually found the first part, the 'Logan's Run' section as I like to think of it, rather uninteresting and the movie didn't really take off until the chase section (the middle). Somewhat paradoxically, I feel that the cloning stuff (which I didn't like) might have been made more interesting if it wasn't used simply as a springboard for the chase scenes (which I did like).I thought that flying motorcycle was really cool; I caught myself smiling when I saw that.I didn't understand why that technician at the installation just hands Ewan the keys to gain access to the boiler room area. He never would have learned about the outside world if that didn't happen.Acting-wise, I thought everyone was fine, I'm just torn whether I liked the movie as a whole.",5,3,5,24 July 2005
