Casablanca," An extraordinary film from start to finish
","What I found most extraordinary about this film is the way it manages to engage right from the start. Within ten minutes, the plot had me enthralled, the characters had me emotionally committed and I was fascinated by the moral questions.How will Viktor Lazlo escape the Nazis? How complete is Rick's moral degradation? Is there any limit to the depravity of the Vichy regime's representative in Morocco? What happened in Paris between Rick and Ilsa? These questions are all addressed simultaneously as the action unfolds with hypnotic acting by both Bogart and Bergman and brilliantly tight plotting.Some of the other actors are not quite up to the standard of the leads, but I think this is the way films were made at the time, with broader acting by minor parts than we usually see in films today.So much of this film is now cliche, but that's because it defined modern Hollywood cinema and thus had a tremendous impact on Western culture. With some essential cultural artefacts, this ubiquity can make them seem a bit tired or over the top, but Casablanca is so perfectly pitched and moves along at such a wonderful pace that it transcends its own transcendence to be what Hollywood has always aspired to - pure entertainment.",10,4,4,17 February 2018
The Death of Stalin," Merciless, challenging, complex and ultimately successful satire.
","This is a very difficult film to figure out. It has the biting satire and perfectly constructed slapstick of Armando Iannucci's other work, but it is quite different, narratively. There are no sympathetic characters, no naive protagonist for the viewer to empathise with and no emotionally engaging narrative arc. However, none of those omissions make it a bad film. In fact, I suspect that they are all deliberate. The film seeks to alienate the viewer, inspiring a kind of can't-look-away compulsion and repulsion with extreme violence and slapstick comedy placed side-by-side. This is irony on a grand scale, an ironic use of irony. Two days after seeing the film, I still haven't quite figured out if this works, but I've enjoyed and been challenged by the process of mulling it over, so I guess that means it did work?It has certainly stayed with me more than most films do, at least partly because of how accurate it is. Look up just about any of the events referred to in the film (not the dialogue, of course) and it turns out they are true or even UNDERSTATED. I can't outline those here without spoiling the film, but I would recommend that after watching it you look up Vasily Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria on Wikipedia and be prepared to be astonished and horrified.The performances are mostly top notch, with the characters all watchable despite their despicable nature.",8,1,2,10 April 2018
The Big Lebowski," A brilliant portrait of a character and his friends
","Watching this film I got a very strong sense that the Coen brothers created a character and then everyone involved in the film found themselves falling in love with him. There's so much absurdity in this film, but at it's heart is a character whose realness (in the sense of 'keeping it real') grounds it all. So many things test the Dude's commitment to his own personal ethic and, in what is essentially a romp, the challenge to his moral compass creates layers one can't imagine from a synopsis of the film.And it's all perfectly executed: Jeff Bridges is fantastic, John Goodman simultaneously aggravating and charming, the dialogue so snappy and the one liners so quotable. Then there's the sort of soundtrack that filmmakers can assemble when they're at the top of their game and direction that doesn't intrude, except when it wants to.I hadn't seen this film for years, but there's so much going on I'm sure I could watch it again in a week and not be bored.",10,1,3,9 March 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A sizzling, soaring satire that hasn't aged a day.
","This film is scintillating, excoriating, scorching...think of any violent word you can and it will describe this film. Forget action movies with their death counts of dozens or thousands of people. The stakes in this film are as high as they can be, with the world on the brink of nuclear war. The mechanics of military command are ruthlessly exposed and somehow I found the procedural details on B-52 bomber horribly enthralling. Oh, and it's very funny. Peter Sellars plays three roles and nails them all. The sequence of events is wonderfully absurd, except that there was a short talk before the screening I saw and the academic who spoke explained that declassified documents have revealed that the only false thing in the whole film is the disclaimer at the start (demanded by the airforce?) that says it couldn't happen. Alert to the prospect of a strategic strike on Washington that would destroy the only people capable of authorising a nuclear attack, the US government implemented a system just like the one in the film whereby individual generals could launch a nuclear strike.Similarly, the paranoia rings true - if the US had launched a nuclear attack, of course Soviet intelligence would have had every incentive to deceive those carrying out the attack into believing the order had been rescinded. And the fear of being left behind in any technological race rings true as well.Also it's hilarious: that music that plays every time the scene is on the B-52 bomber! But poignant and beautiful. The mountains sticking up above the clouds at the beginning are breathtaking and somehow sad and, particularly early on many of the shots of the plane flying are gorgeous. And the war room is such a brilliant set.So although satire can sometimes be distancing or alienating, with this film be prepared for lots of feelings.",10,4,5,3 March 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," No plot, no tension and too long, but oh, that final concert!
","Bohemian Rhapsody is the unthrilling account of one man's quest to sequentially join a band, become famous, write Bohemian Rhapsody, record Bohemian Rhapsody, release Bohemian Rhapsody as a single, come out of the closet and reunite with his band in time to play Live Aid before he dies of AIDS. Don't worry, I haven't given any spoilers, as the only one of these things you might not be 100% sure is going to happen if you're a casual Queen fan is the Live Aid thing, and the movie shows this happening in its first scene. As a consequence, there is no tension whatsoever in this film. Particularly difficult problems might occasionally require two scenes to overcome, but the vast majority are sorted out within the same scene they arose.Sample dialogue:
Mercury: 'We're going to write a rhapsody about Bohemians.'
Record executive: 'That can't possibly be done.'
Mercury: 'We've already written it.'
Record executive: 'Well there's no way you can record it.'
Interior, recording studio.
'It's a Bo...hemian rhapsody.'Fortunately, the narrative (!) part of the movie finishes with 20 minutes to go, and the finale is simply a recreation of the 1985 Live Aid set. The music is so compelling and the visuals so beautifully shot that it's almost enough to make the viewer forget the nonsense that has preceded it. But then, I'd been in my seat for over two hours by the time the Live Aid sequence started and it was very hard to understand why some of the 'Should we update our sound and write Another One Bites the Dust?' 'Yes, let's do that,' conversations couldn't simply have been deleted.Maybe I just don't understand biopics, but to me, this movie is a mess, and not one worth persisting with (Queen's Live Aid set is available on Youtube).",5,3,7,4 February 2019
