Scarface," Gangster Classic
","I recommend this as a must for any gangster fan. Al Pacino has never been better as Gangster Tony Montana the person the whole film is about. This basically charts his rise to power and his eventual demise. The Journey is a masterclass in filmaking from start to finish with Brian De Palma adding his unique style to every scene. As well as Pacino,Steven Bauer,Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Loggia are all excellent. The films style is heavily influenced by the 80's being made in 1983 the soundtrack fits perfectly with the colourful scenes of the film. The Cocaine industry is the crime element of the film Which again is fits with the time the film is set in. I cannot praise the film enough a true classic which will always be remembered. I was immediately gripped from the start a must see.",10,0,1,6 October 2006
