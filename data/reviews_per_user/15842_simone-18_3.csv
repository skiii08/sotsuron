The Blair Witch Project," Truly gripping!
","Having missed this in the cinema, I sat down one Saturday night in the dark to see what all the fuss was about. I've read a collection of the opinion of others who appear to be totally split on this.The main reason to watch this is for its originality. It does capture the fear of the dark and requires your own imagination to work out what is happening. I have little idea what happened out there in the woods but I was sure as hell scared by it.A must see movie if only to make your own mind up about it. 8/10",8,0,1,20 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Reminiscent of the good old days
","Whilst the Phantom menace left me cold and bored, this really enthused me. I think that the pace was really good particularly after Obi arrives on the clones planet. It started to zip along and the fight scenes at the end were terrific. It took me back to the excitement of the earlier films and always looked awesome.It was a bit twee when it came to romance but well, that was never Lucas' strongpoint. His vision of the future was scintillating to look at and for me that was never in itself.I reckon the third installment will be fantastic!",7,0,0,15 June 2002
Shrek," Very enjoyable
","I haven't laughed at a film as much as this in a long time. This is popcorn cinema at its best. Eddie Murphy's donkey is excellent as are all the characters. Ok, afterwards it dissolves in the brain like sherbet and it certainly is not a top #250 film. However I really liked it and it's a probable 8.",Null,1,2,9 July 2001
