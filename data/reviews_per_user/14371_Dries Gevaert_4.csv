The Blair Witch Project," This will psychologically kill you.
","Whow. Most horror movies don't scare me, mostly because you just get scared for one moment (like when someone's walking into a dark hallway and the killer jumps in front of him), and because those movies are very often just one big cliché. But this really scared the s**t out of me. This is not jumping in front of someone and stabbing him, this is psychologically killing someone. Here's how you do that: First, scare the victims with some weird voodoo stuff they'd rather don't want to have anything to do with. Then torture them by taking away something they really need, their sleep for example, scare them so hard they live the whole day in fear of the night. And ultimately, literally scare them to death by letting them now there's no escape. They'll surely gonna go totally insane, and maybe they might kill themselves. If they don't you'll do it.`Finally an original concept in a movie, I haven't seen that for a long time. It's too bad that the geniuses who came up with this idea didn't get a bigger budget... Actually, it isn't, because being suck a low budget movie adds to the realism of this movie (it's supposed to be found footage so it's gotta be crappy). There's no other way of making this movie. It's great, and I think it's too bad that some people can't see that. They'll probably walk into the theater or the video store think they're gonna be amused (that's what most people think after 3 Screams, 2 Last Summers and dozens of other copies). But this is the type of movie that is made to crawl under your skin and eat you slowly from the inside out.Another thing that those people probably didn't like is that you don't know half the story. EVERY Hollywood movie has a complete story with a beginning, an ending and stuff happening in the middle, and the viewer sees everything. This movie is in fact not a movie, as the makers try to tell you that it's just a bunch of found footage put together. And of course the camera's not always running, so there's no continuous story. Which leaves you with some big holes to fill after the movie. One solution is the website that caused the hype when the movie was in theaters and which made me go hire the movie. But it doesn't answer all of your questions, in fact it just adds to the mystery of the whole thing.Acting. That would be nice in this movie, some people who could put down a credible personage (not someone famous, that would be real stupid, someone who is unknown and took acting classes). I think Heather is about the only one who really made me think that this was real (and that is what the movie is about, right?). Josh and Mikey overact most of the time. I noticed that if you watch the actors closely the movie seems less scary, probably because you see that they're just acting.The atmosphere created by the people who made this (actors, editors, directors, marketing guys and webmasters) is great, it crawls under your skin and makes the movie scare the hell out of you. That atmosphere is what made this 100,000 $ movie a million dollar blockbuster. Since there was no directing at all (the directors just sent the actors in the woods with their equipment and the script), s****y acting in some scenes, some dumb things in the story (map, runaway) and an empty feeling at the end, I rate this movie a 9/10",9,1,2,20 July 2000
MASH," A Holiday at the Front.
","This movie is quite funny, quite emotional, quite dirty, quite bloody, quite original, etc. All these little bits, combined with great acting, smooth and clean directing and the special atmosphere make this an exceptionally good movie. They're in Korea reanimating dead people, but still they enjoy their time, they try to relax a little, and I like that. Although I don't really see surgeons 3 miles from the front line acting like they're on holiday, but that's a little exaggerated of course. I can imagine that people at the front need a lot of humor to forget their fears.Also exceptionally for a war movie is that the characters are no stereotypes, they have feelings, their mind evolves through the movie (like Hotlips, she really changed a lot: from the strict bitchy army officer to a woman who wants to seize the day). Try to find that in Rambo.There's just one thing that bothers me about this movie: there isn't a real story going through the whole movie. Yes, there are some little stories, like the fights between Burns and the other surgeons. but they disappear after a while. The movie feels like you're watching the pilot episode of a TV series without a cliffhanger.But that's a detail of course. I watched the movie and enjoyed myself very good, and that's what counts.9/10",7,0,2,24 July 2000
American Beauty," Almost perfect.
","Really great movie, especially thanks to the almost perfect acting by Kevin Spacey and the smooth, clear directing. Maybe Annette Bening does overact a little, but it doesn't affect the fascinating story... Magnificent... 10/10",10,0,0,27 May 2000
Final Destination," Very promising start but a horrible ending.
","(cointains some plot spoilers)Having read a lot of promising reviews here and on other sites, I walked into the theater expecting some sort of Scream-ish movie, but with a story and good acting (despite the unknown actors). But it didn't really turn out the way I though it would. The first scenes, with the unbelievably realistic air crash (vision) and the sudden explosion of the plane (in real life) were magnificent. No one could have done it better. But the problem was to find original 'accidents' that will happen to the survivors, and that's where the movie loses its rhythm.The first one with the water was nice and very original, but the rest of the movie was just cliché after cliché. The writers seemed to like the story they found, with the dumb coincidences and the 'plan of death' stuff, and decided to keep re-using that idea till the end of the movie. Special effects and coincidences would do the rest. But the special effects didn't do nothing. All I noticed were some horribly irritating electricity wires flying across the screen. And despite all the coincidences, who by the way make the movie very unrealistic, the movie stays a little predictable.The first 15 minutes were great, the last 15 minutes sucked reeeally hard. It's just a bunch of things happening without a story: Alex escapes death for like 20 times, talks to himself about death not going to get him and stuff, and the last moment he realizes what everybody in the theater had already figured out (PLOT SPOILER:) he hadn't changed seats and it isn't his turn after all (while he had escaped death for 20 times, that doesn't make any sense) and so he runs to Clears house where things keep going wrong. The director must have said 'From this point, f**k the story, let's just have some more electricity, bad luck and everybody doing stupid things nobody else would do in their place.' If the movie had been longer like this I surely would have walked out of the theater. My God.For some dumb reason, (PLOT SPOILER:) everyone survives the car that blew up and nothing happens for some months, until they go to Paris BY PLANE (40 of their friends died in an air crash and they just survived it, and a few months later they travel by plane? Hahahahahaha!) and suddenly death seems to remember them and things start to go wrong again.The air crash and the first killing were great and certainly deserve a 10/10, but in the end its just such a horrible mess. 6/10",6,1,1,17 July 2000
