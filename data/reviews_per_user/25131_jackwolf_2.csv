Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The First Chapter of an Epic Saga!
","The Phantom Menace far surpassed my expectations, probably because my expectations had been lowered by much of the negative criticism this film generated, mostly by disgruntled geeks who are afraid of change, like hardened conservatives panicking when a democrat wins an election. It's really childish and pathetic.The 'magic' of Star Wars is still present in Episode 1. Although this first film seems slightly bent toward a more younger audience, this in no way affects the quality of the film. The acting, plot, visuals, audio are all top notch. The main complaints for this film seem to center around Jar Jar Binks, a character I happened to really like. The underwater trip to the Gungan city and then to the capitol of Naboo was one of the best parts of the film, and I thought the interaction between Jar Jar, Qui Gon, and Obi Wan was splendid entertainment at its finest! Sure there are a few clich√©s throughout this film that serve as minor annoyances but they don't in any way inhibit that 'magic' from shining through.Episode 1 is a fine edition to the Star Wars saga, and one that did not deserve the rampant criticism it received by many. This is top notch entertainment, and George Lucas' complete Star Wars saga is a stupendous success, an impressive result of a vision and the drive to fulfill that vision. Thank you Mr. Lucas!",6,80,140,31 December 2010
Amistad," A pro-Jewish, anti-Christian look at Slavery
","I had to rate this movie a 1 out of 10. When ever I see an example where history is intentionally made to look a certain way, as to favor one people, and to go against another, I can't help by leave with a bad taste in my mouth.Spielberg (Jewish), portrays slavery as being the fault of Africans themselves and Christians. In one of the scenes, a slave apologizes for the suffering that the Jews have gone through, which is absurd in light of the fact that he was a slave. This was an attempt by Spielberg, a jew, to promote his Jewish agenda, to make people feel sorry for Jews, as if they were the people who've suffered the most.It is ludicrous! Spielberg is a disingenuous director. His movies, Schindler's List and Amistad are incredibly biased and twist history to fit a pro-Jewish agenda.Watch the movie, but be warned of the biases and agendas being promoted in it.",1,28,62,26 September 2010
