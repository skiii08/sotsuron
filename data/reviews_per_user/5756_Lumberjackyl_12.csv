Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good (not great) addition to the Star Wars saga.
","I have been debating for a long time whether or not to write a review on Episode I. Star Wars is not just another film series to me, it is a very special series. The Empire Strikes Back is definately my favourite movie of all time, and I did not want to have anything negative to say about Episode I. After first viewing this film, I was a little bit shocked at how 'candy coated' it was. It seems that this film was made for children. I just could not grasp the fact of a young Darth Vader running around yelling 'YIPPPEEE!'. It made me quiver inside. However, after viewing the film today on DVD, while listening to the commentary track, I have finally been able to grasp more about what Lucas was thinking when he made this film. Lucas wanted to make Anakin appear as a young man, who was very kind and generous. This way, it would be alot more interesting to see just why he turns to the dark side. Think about it...if Anakin was a little trouble maker from the beginning, it would not be as interesting. We would know right away why he turned. Anyone that was in trouble their whole life, would obviously be sent down the dark path. However, in making Anakin a good little boy...it just makes it more interesting to see why he turned. Where did he go wrong? What kind of choices does he make? What in the world could possess such an innocent child to turn into one of Hollywood's greatest villains?The story is definately not spectacular, like any of the other three original movies. However, remember that this is the first act in a very long story. Lucas needed to introduce the characters, give them a little bit of a history. This way, further in the series, we will know exactly where they came from. Of course this movie will never live up to the original trilogy...but it is very far from being the worst movie ever made as some like to claim. If you have a DVD player, invest a few dollars, rent the movie, or better yet, buy the movie. Watch it with Lucas' commentary on. You will definately see a different side to 'The Phantom Menace'. It really helped me in learning to accept this movie into the fantastic universe of Star Wars.",7,1,2,3 November 2001
Scary Movie 2," Stupid! Stupid! STOOOOPID!!!
","This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Stupider (if possible), than the original Scary Movie.The first scene, which parodies the Exorcist, was entertaining. However, once the rest of the movie started, I did not laugh once. The stupidest movie of the year.I am still trying to find out how a bad movie like this gets made.",Null,0,1,11 September 2002
Top Secret!," Absolutely brainless humour. Not funny at all.
","When I was a kid, I was very amused by this film. Therefore, when it was on the television the other night, I could not wait to sit and watch it. Obviously, my tastes have grown since in the last 18 years since I last saw this film. Total rubbish!Val Kilmer plays a teen rock idol who visits East Germany for a concert. During his stay there, he gets involved with a resistance to overthrow the German government.From the same people that brought us Airplane! (another idiotic film), this movie is full of sight gags and cheap parodies of other films. What gets me is that films of this nature are so popular. This type of comedy is not funny at all, and is usually very tasteless humour.If you like the type of comedy in the Airplane movies or the Hot Shot series, then this film is definately for you. Otherwise, I would definately avoid this film.",Null,0,4,5 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Unbelievable film! Roll over Star Wars...The Lord has arrived!
","Never in my life did I think that a movie would come out that I would fall in love with more than my love for Star Wars. However, today was the day when I went to see this incredible epic film.It has been a long time since I read the novel, however, I was still familiar with all the main characters. Being a fan of the fantasy genre since I was a young one, it was great to finally see Elves, Hobbits, Orcs and the such look just the way that I envisioned them. The film makers really out did themselves.Since it has been so long since I read the actual novel, I am not sure of any parts that were missing, or how accurate it was. Guess I will have to pick it up once more to read again.The storyline revolves around Frodo Baggins, who comes to own an all powerful ring. The ring however can bring the kindest man to do evil and selfish things. Under the guidance of Gandolf the wizard, Frodo sets out on a journey to destroy the ring before it falls into the wrong hands.The scenery is fantastic, the acting brilliant, and the music score is beautiful and haunting. Not since Star Wars has a film touched me in this way. Hopefully the Academy Awards will also agree with the great effects, as this film deserves to sweep the Oscars.This is definately one film that is not to be missed. Bring your mother, your father, your dog if you have to...just do not miss this instant classic film!!",10,0,0,23 December 2001
Spider-Man," Simply amazing! The most amazing comic book motion picture in over 20 years!
","Not since the first Superman film has a comic book movie been translated to the silver screen so superbly. Finally, after more than 20 years, another great superhero comes to the big screen, in Spider-Man.Peter Parker is a not so popular kid in school, who is in love with the most beautiful and popular girl in school, Mary Jane Watson. During a field trip to a science lab, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and soon transforms into Spider-Man. While Spider-Man fights crime, there is a new terror in New York...the Green Goblin.Simply amazing film. Sam Raimi did a terrific job. Tobey Maguire is really believable as Peter Parker, and does a fantastic job as Spider-Man. And let's not forget Mary Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst). She is simply stunning in this film. (Please Kirsten, keep the red hair!!)This movie is definately going to be one of (if not the top) grossing movie of all time. It has been a long time coming, but it has definately been worth the wait. Can't wait for the sequel. You know they are coming.",Null,0,0,12 May 2002
Aliens," Amazing! Scary, thrilling and non-stop action sci-fi flick!
","Top notch special effects, a fantastic cast, and a flawless story make this one of the greatest science fiction/horror films ever. Definately James Cameron's greatest film ever.57 years after the events on the starship Nostromo, Ripley (played here again by Sigourney Weaver), is rescued from her deep space sleep, only to have to return to the planet from where the aliens originated with a group of commandos to investigate the disappearance of colonists.Aliens is definately superior to the original. I love to see hundreds of those slimy creatures take out the toughest marines. And the ending of the film is just brilliant, as we finally get to see where the aliens are actually coming from.This film has got it all. After watching this film, I have to wonder what the hell happened to James Cameron? He used to make the greatest films, such as Aliens, and The Terminator, and now he makes Titanic? Hopefully, Cameron will return to the action genre, and keep us all entertained with another classic science fiction/action film.The best film by James Cameron to date, is also one of the scariest films of all time. This film beats out any horror film in terms of thrills and chills, as Cameron uses the best lighting and effects to keep you on the edge of your seat.If you have not seen Aliens, you do not know what you are missing.",7,0,2,5 January 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Spectacular animation!! A great festive movie for all!!
","What other movie could you enjoy both at Halloween time, and Christmas time? A great movie for kids of all ages!! Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this fun movie.The story is quite simple...There are many different worlds, where all of our favourite holiday characters live. This one takes place in Halloweentown. Jack, the pumpkin king, is sick of the same thing over and over each year. However, he soon comes across Christmas town. Falling totally in love with the spirit of Christmas, he decides that the community of Halloweentown take over Christmas for the year...with monstrous results.From the fantastic animation, to the great soundtrack, this is definately a film for the whole family to enjoy.",Null,0,1,29 October 2001
Black Hawk Down," Ridley Scott's crowning moment! A definite must see.
","Move over Speilberg! Watch out below Cameron! One of the best war movies ever made is easily Ridley Scott's best movie ever, topping even Gladiator. All hail Ridley Scott, the new king of the world. This movie is realistic, and intense. Some may find the film a little bit too violent, but hey, war is not a walk in the park. Basically, the whole 2 hours of this movie plays like the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. If you were easily disturbed by those scenes, then this film is definately not for you.The film is based on the true story of a US Black Hawk that was shot down in Somalia during 1993. The rest of the film is basically a rescue operation to get those men out of the dangerous situation that they are in.The acting in the film is great. The only thing that really bothered me was Tom Sizemore's character. We see him walking around while bullets fly around him, and he does not seem fazed at all. Also, there is the scene in the Hummer, where he gets shot in the neck, and is still able to steer the Hummer with one hand, and hold the wound in his neck with the other.
One other beef that I had with this movie is the characters. Alot of the time was spent on the war scenes, and there was no character introduction. Therefore, you really can not connect with the charcters in the film. If you like to get in touch with the characters in the film, I suggest watching a film like Platoon rather than this. I do believe however, that Scott was trying to show us the horror of modern warfare, which he does very well.Like I stated above, it is rather violent. However, that is war. You will not see anything that they do not show on the nightly news. However, this is Hollywood. If you are desensitized to violence, check it out. It is definately Ridley Scott's best film to date. Hopefully, the man will win an Oscar for this film. He definately deserves one.",Null,0,0,16 January 2002
From Hell," Haunting....the story of Jack The Ripper brought to full life..
","One word can sum up this film....haunting. From the opening scenes in this film, to the finish, I was on the edge of my seat. Although the story is not historically accurate (I have never read the graphic novel, but have read alot of books about the Ripper), it was a genuinely entertaining film, one that seriously scared the hell out of me. There are not many films that have had this sort of impact on me.There were certain aspects that were based on fact, such as the Prince of England being linked to the murders after a bout with syphillis, however, most of it is Hollywood fiction. I will not complain however, as I stated above, it was the first movie since the Wickerman and The Exorcist that left me in a state of awe and shock. Johnny Depp was hypnotic as the inspector assigned to the case of the Ripper, while Heather Graham was simply fantastic as the whore that he tries to protect, and Ian Holm was spectacular as usual. Some may think that this movie is alittle too violent, however, it does get the point across as to how brutal a killer Jack the Ripper actually was. The first real horror film of the year is definately one that you should not miss. Rip yourself away from that computer, and go and see...From Hell.",Null,1,2,20 October 2001
Detroit Rock City," The best coming of age comedy to date. Hysterical film!
","While growing up, I was always a huge Kiss fan, and when I heard that they were making this film, I was a little skeptical. After seeing the God awful Kiss Meets the Phantom (even me, the mega-fan can't get into that one), I didn't know what to expect. This film shocked the hell out of me. It was well written, well acted, and just plain hysterical. Pure comic greatness. There is not enough good things to say about this film.The film takes place in 1978, when Kiss were on top of the world. Four friends decide to take a trip to Detroit to see their heroes in action. As they travel, they have many different adventures, all very funny and exciting.This film bombed at the box office, and it was a true shame. When I saw this on opening night, there were only five other people in the theatre. Even if you are not into Kiss, give this movie a chance, as it really does entertain, and does a good job of re-creating the late 70's.",Null,0,2,13 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Wonderful! A great film for all ages!
","Having never read any of the books, I did not know what to expect when I went to view this film. All I knew about it was what I read in the newspapers, and saw on the news. This movie is magnificent, and will surely become a classic!! The story, special effects, and even the unknown actors, all do a wonderful job in this great film.Harry is an orphaned boy of a witch and wizard, who is sent to live with his aunt and uncle. However, at his eleventh (sorry if I'm wrong about his age) birthday, he gets summoned to become a wizard at a wizard's school. This is where all the fun begins.Unlike many of the other reviewers here, as stated above, I have never read the book, so I cannot compare the two. However, I was entertained for the two and a half hours that the movie lasted. The special effects were great, and the scene where Harry and the boys are playing some sort of sport on their broomsticks is just fantastic. It made me think of the podrace scene in 'The Phantom Menace'.Everyone should definately give this movie a chance. Really enjoyable for all.",7,0,0,26 November 2001
Rock Star," One of the best movies of 2001
","This is one of the few movies that were ever made that I am able to watch time and time again. Perhaps it has to do with the soundtrack, which smokes, or the fact that it takes place in the 1980's, which I just love, or maybe it has to do with the fact that my favorite type of music is 80's heavy metal. This is definately one of the best period movies ever made.Mark Wahlberg stars as Chris Cole, a singer in a tribute band to Steel Dragons. When the lead singer of Steel Dragons decides to leave the band, Chris is brought in to replace him. Based on the real life story of Tim 'Ripper' Owens of Judas Priest, this is one film that will actually make you feel like the rock star in the film.The period pieces in this film are great, however, some of the music does not fit the film. The film is supposed to take place in 1985, however, for some reason or another, we here songs that were not released until 1990 or later that appear in the film. This is just a minor oversight, however, perfectionists will find fault in this.Mark Walhberg gives a very convincing performance as a heavy metal singer. I was a little scared when I heard that he would be doing this film, however, he did the 80's metal scene justice. He really nailed the look and sound of the 80's right on. Also, the addition of Jeff Pilson (Dokken), Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne), Blas Elias (Slaughter), and several other rockers, adds to the reality of this film.This film is truly one of the best of 2001. It was overlooked at the box office, and seemed to flop. I do believe that it will find a cult following on DVD and video. Do yourself a favour and rent this film. I guarantee, whether you are a metal fan or not, you will really like this film.",Null,1,2,26 January 2002
