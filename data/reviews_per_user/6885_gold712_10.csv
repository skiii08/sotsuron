Alien 3," pretty good
","Alien 3 was okay, but it lacked the suspense and thrills of the two before it. They tried the use of computer effects with not much great skill, so some special effects seem a little cheesy. Sigourney Weaver gives a great performance as Ripley. The ending is very good because it shows the sacrifice she must make in order to wipe out this species.
Alien 3 gives a very different scenario, but everything is very confusing. The director didn't know what he was doing. The acting is good, but it didn't have as much action that made the other two so great. However, it's a good installment of the series, letting you feel the pain and emotion of Ripley as she loses everything she ever cared for. I recommend Alien 3, but I can't guarantee or think you'll like it better than Alien and Aliens.Rating: 6 out of 10",6,0,2,31 January 2000
Alien: Resurrection," a great film
","Although not as good as the first two, it is completely better than the third. Great performances by the actors and very good directing. Alien: Ressurection is a worthy installment of this great saga.Even though this film doesn't have a plot, it doesn't ever get boring. It's hard not to feel the sad emotion as Ripley looks at all the 'mistakes' in trying to bring her back to life. Lots of funny remarks by Johner, lots of shocks, and lots of suspense. It's also got pretty high gore.I recommend this filmRating: 8 out of 10",8,0,1,31 January 2000
Alien," THE BEST IN THE SERIES!!!
","This first film is by far the best in the series. It has everything: great acting, a beautiful musical score, exciting suspense, astounding special effects, superb filming, and so much more. Alien was a breakthrough for 1979. Many people think Aliens was better, but you can't beat the first. This is one of the greatest thrillers ever made in science fiction. Sigourney Weaver gives a show-stopping performance as Ellen Ripley. Yaphet Kotto does extremely well also, as does Tom Skerrit and Ian Holm.
Alien is a film we will never forget!Rating: 9 out of 10",8,0,1,30 January 2000
The Shining," a true masterpiece!!
","The Shining is one of the best horror films in all history. It doesn't matter how many times you see it, it never gets boring. Jack Nicholson gives a show-stopping performance, and is perfect for the role, playing a perfect evil bad guy. With many other memorable performances, The Shining is a film to add to any movie collection. A true gem, it is filled with suspense. Not many films today can beat this massive masterpiece.Rating: 8 out of 10'Here's Johnny!'",8,0,0,7 February 2000
Aliens," one of the greatest action thrillers ever made!
","Aliens, although not as good as the first, is a truly astounding installment of the series. Director James Cameron's director's cut gives us seventeen more minutes of pure movie magic. This film has the best action ever to appear in a film. It's so suspensful, you'll find yourself clinging to your seat. Sigourney Weaver shows massive development of her character which is important for the role. Bill Paxton (Hudson) gives some of the funniest lines in the film.
Aliens has great special effects, and so much action you don't know when it will end. I recommend this film to everybody because it gives a little bit of everything. Rating: 8 out of 10",8,0,0,30 January 2000
The Evil Dead," a splatter-house epic
","This movie has got to be one of the greatest horror films ever made. This film has it all: dismemberments, decapitations, buckets of blood and gore, demons, possesions, and some very suspensful moments. It's also unintentionaly funny at times. Example: the hacking scene. It's a great movie to watch in the dark. Tons of shocks. The Evil Dead is the best of the three films.However, Ash seems to be kind of a pussy in this first film, compared to the other two in which he's cool and sarcastic. But this is important for the development of this character.I recommend this film to everybody who enjoys horror with some funny bits. Warning: Not for weak stomachs. If your going to see it, get the UNRATED version.Rating: 8 out of 10",8,0,0,28 January 2000
Army of Darkness," one of the great cult classics
","Army of Darkness is a very worthy sequel to the Evil Dead series. It combines horror with a wise-ass department store clerk who makes sarcastic and very funny remarks. A great film with good special effects and extremely funny humor. Rent this movie!! Bruce Campbell gives a great perfomance as Ash with some good acting from other characters as well. Not too much gore, so people with weak stomaches will like it.Great fun!!! Rent it!!Rating: 8 out of 10",8,1,1,7 February 2000
Halloween," a very good film
","Halloween is one of the greatest classic horror films. Some of the acting is not so great, but the suspense makes up for it. Michael Myers gives his best performance in any of the films. He has truly creepy appearences, and mixed in with the music, is really scary. I recommend this film for everybody. For those who don't like too much blood, this film doesn't have any gore, but it does have some blood. Rent this film. You'll never forget this gem, this wonder of a film.Rating: 7 out of 10",7,0,0,21 February 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," a true horror classic
","One of the greatest slasher horrors of all time, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a genuine film masterpiece by Wes Craven. Filled with startling special effects and heart-pounding suspense, A Nightmare on Elm Street gives you a feeling of adrenaline. The acting is not so great, yet Johnny Depp (his first film) gives a great performance. ***SPOILER****Freddy Kruger, a terryfying child murderer, was killed in a burning warehouse where he took his victims. Now, he comes to a group of teenagers in their dreams. However, if he kills you in your dream, you'll be dead in real life.***END OF SPOILER*** Freddy, as the series progresses, becomes more and more smart-ass. Yet in this film he is pure evil.I recommend this film to anybody who loves horror. A true great classic. Wes Craven at his best.Rating: 7 out of 10'Come to Freddy...'",9,0,0,5 February 2000
Evil Dead II," screw everyone who thinks this movie sucks
","This is a great movie! Not as gory as the first, but who cares. This one is actually a horror/comedy, also a sequel/remake. Evil Dead II has so much more in it, that you forget it's really a remake. But in many other ways it's not.Let's get this out of they way. Yes, it is a remake, but hardly so. The film get to business very quickly. The first seven minutes of the film is kind of a retro of the first film. Then when the demons first possess him (but the sun scares it away) is right where is first film left off. Now the second epic really begins. But there are scenes that are back in there.SECRET: In 'Nightmare on Elm Street', there is a scene where someone is watching The Evil Dead on T.V. In response to this, Freddy's glove can be seen somewhere in the 'fruit celler'.This film is really a comedy. What's more comedic than a man who has a battle with his own hand, or a laughing lamp. This is where the sarcastic side of Ash really kicks off. RENT THIS FILM!! A must-see for fans of horror/comedy like Braindead (also called Dead Alive).Rating: 7 out of 10 'Groovy..'",7,1,1,28 January 2000
