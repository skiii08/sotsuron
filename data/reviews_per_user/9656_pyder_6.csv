Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not Enough Charm to Cover How Boring It is
","It took me 3 tries to sit through it. At one point I threw an empty bottle across the room when I saw that I still had 55 minutes left in it.Johnny Depp's shtick is wearing thin. I can't not see Tommy Wiseau all over Johnny Depp's continually sloppier and slurrier Jack Sparrow.The romances were just... bad. Like these might work in a different setting or story but not in this one.I saw everything in the plot coming about 20-40 minutes early.Like, this movie was even too boring to be background nonsense while I played Roller Coaster Tycoon on my phone and ate mini donuts.One of the biggest issues is how Jack Sparrow has just the most insane plot armour. Nothing hurts him. Not jumping off a cliff. Not jumping off a tower. Not any of that ridiculous chase scene. Not any of the moronic escape scene.It was endearing when like some minor level of absurd hijinks worked in his favour, but its too many bananas when Jack is Assassin's Creed-ing across the landscape where every action creates a cascade of other actions that perfectly create the exact calamity and circumstances for the wacky outcome to happen flawlessly. And then to follow it with a joke thats basically Jim Halpert staring into the camera.Sometimes the human kickstarted rube goldberg machine is fun. But not in almost every chase/escape/action sequence. Less is more. Ant-Man doesn't have Michael Pena doing his story telling gag 2, 3, 5, 69 times a film.Sword fights are cool.",5,0,1,22 July 2018
Doctor Strange," Paging Doctor Mister Strange. Your Dope Origin Story Is Here
","4.4/5Well, Marvel went and made themselves a two hour movie that felt like a 90 minute fast paced, tripping balls, action movie and it rocked. I'm positive that the 1h55m run time listed on IMDb is a lie.The action was well shot and smart. It was 'magical' and manipulative. Creative and the use of the environment sets this apart from shoot-bang-kick-smash that most of the Marvel movies do.The climax was great, smart and interesting on a few levels. I would have liked a little more fire, though (and you'll understand that once you see it).The trippy kaleidoscope effects were worth the price of admission. Same with the bright colours and tints and blurs and whatever else. I'm not one who does, but people who partake in certain psychedelics would have a blast about 30 minutes in.Would I like to have seen a little more doctor-ing? Sure enough. More Rachel McAdams being a Canadian sweetheart? Yeah. Some more cult time? Sure! ...Full review: http://wp.me/p3Ww9J-mf :)",9,1,3,5 November 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Last Jedi Exists and that is fine.
","Now that The Last Jedi has happened, can we all agree at this point there are two good Star Wars movies? A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. That's it, right? Return of the Jedi is fine, prequels are bad, The Force Awakens is likeable and Rogue One smells.What bores me is that Star Wars is limited by the exact things that made it seem limitless because without established Star Wars elements to carry the world and narrative such as light sabres, the Millennium Falcon, TIE fighters and X-Wings, and the dueling sides of The Force, what even is this galaxy far far away? Why is the world of Star Wars essentially the same as it was 40 years ago? You never really see The Empire or The First Order tormenting regular people. You don't get the impression that the every day person is bothered by them.The film is messy. Characterization and traits can be inconsistent. There are pacing issues, tone issues, plot issues. Its probably a half hour too long. The execution wasn't perfect. In trying to make the twists and turns, it doesn't always go forward or even sideways. Sometimes it makes the left or right to satisfy and surprise, other times it does enough turns that its back where it started.With quality performances and enough paint, you can hide a lot of the cracks.At times subversion worked and that's where the interest was. At times it didn't because for all the ways it tried to be original there was nonsense mixed in and it still ended with red light sabre Sith and a military against inexperienced blue light sabre Jedi and the rebels. That honestly can't be a spoiler. Don't @ me.Failure can be interesting and a great story device unless you make that failure meaningless.",5,0,6,25 July 2018
Don't Breathe," Hold your breath but don't close your eyes
","Terryfing, thrilling, suspenseful and I basically crapped my pants so often I should have been wearing adult diapers to make it a bit cleaner.All the actors are really good. How small and self contained the movie is really helps add to the tension.If you're familiar with the Daredevil Netflix series, then imagine Stick going ham on some kids but way angrier.The sound design is excellent. Stephen Lang is excellent. The dumb kids are excellent.Its unsure who you're really rooting for almost the entire time. The Kids are turdballs that break and enter with intent to burglar. I think its something that makes the movie so compelling. You're equally like 'go Blind man!' and 'RUN KIDS RUN!'There is a twist prior to the climax which makes you re-adjust your rooting interests. Some more stuff happens. And then the end is also a great example of moral ambiguity. Top notch.Full review: http://wp.me/p3Ww9J-ly :)",Null,0,3,6 November 2016
Sausage Party," Funny, crude, and unapologetic.
","I love animated kids movies because they're fun and creative, and this has awesome funny adult stuff all over it. Even better!I'm pretty hit or miss with Seth Rogen as I've never really found 'the joke is that he's smoking weed!' or 'dicks!' as almost every punchline hilarious in his films. They almost get Adam Sandler-y in that if you've seen a couple, you've seen all of them.But this was funny! Very creative, awesome puns, great jokes and the concepts and realization of the ideas are terrific.I can fully admit I see how this isn't right up everyone's alley. But for me, it was worth the price of admission.Full review: http://wp.me/p3Ww9J-ly :)",8,3,5,6 November 2016
Deadpool," Deadpool 2 just plain old doesn't GAF
","One thing that is important to remember is that this is an R rated comedy first and an R rated action movie second with super 'hero' syrup all over and inside its crevices.If you weren't a fan of the first one, well I guess it depends why but DP2 probably won't tickle your jimmies. There is all the swearing, brutal violence, blood, dismemberment, jokes, irreverence and meta-references that you would expect. Every scene with a serious tone is completely cut out by jokes, but this is still a bit more of a movie with plot and characters and motivation and all that sort of jazz. Definitely tried a little harder to make more of a narrative than 'guy kills dude to save girlfriend'.The stakes are really only relevant to those on-screen. Sure, there might be some larger implications if you really think about it, but they're never stated. The implications that are stated are small time, but that makes the stakes personal and better for a plot involving a bunch of selfish characters.Its also nice to have a movie that doesn't take itself seriously in a time where most blockbusters with ridiculous premises are also trying to be like 'BUT THIS IS REAL LIFE!'Its more of what was successful. The same dish, but they just changed the presentation. That isn't a bad thing.",7,0,2,22 July 2018
