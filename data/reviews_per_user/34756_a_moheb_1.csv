The Ring," excellent!
",'The Ring' is a nail-biter from the opening frame. It is a roller coaster for the mind that doesn't let go till every pinpointed detail is revealed. I loved the feeling of this movie as it plays with your mind as the cleverly conceived plot unfolds. The film isn't afraid to slowly release detail after detail very slowly and methodically. A lot of films these days tend to bash us over the head with a shock-ending or gross-fest but this film is too clever for either movie invention.,10,0,0,18 October 2002
