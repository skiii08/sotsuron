The Blair Witch Project," Wicked Good!
","The blair witch project is probably the scariest movie i've seen by a long shot. This movie is probably 10 times better than any high budget movie it had a $40,000 dollar budget and it took in $40,000,000 in the box office. I love this movie that scene when they hear foot steps in the woods is wicked scary. I didn't completely get the end the first time it's so quick i had to rewind and watch it over again. This movie has few flaws if any. Highly recommended I loved it. 9 out of 10 stars, 2 thumbs up.Roosterz review for parents.
