Airlift," Well written Script and excellent performance by actors
",This movie is must watch movie and much better then the recently released movies which wasted my time. This is based on a true story how Iraq invaded Kuwait. The best acting was by Inaamullhaq (The Iraqi Major). Akshay as usual was excellent and Nimrat kaur too. A movie cannot be successful if a single actor does any mistake. In this film everyone acted perfectly. Indian Airlines did more then 400 trips to evacuate the entire 1.7 lakh Indian population. Best part was they could even save some kuwaitis in the act. It also showed that we had good relationship with all the Saudi countries including Iraq. Without the permission of Iraq it was impossible for Indians to escape that place. This shows why we should have good relationship with other countries.,10,1,2,26 January 2016
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Started 2019 with an excellent Movie
","The movie completely surprised me as I read several negative reviews on NDTV, Hindustantimes, Indiatoday etc where they gave just 2/5 stars. From now on I will never ever read their biased reviews. Such out of the way acting by Vicky Kaushal, Yami Gautam,Kirti Kulhari, Paresh Rawal will surprise you. You will get goosebumps in between and you will also become emotional sometimes. There was no extra jingoism. But a full Masala packed movie. Go Watch the excellent Direction, Music, Acting, Cinematography. make your new year special.",10,1,2,14 January 2019
