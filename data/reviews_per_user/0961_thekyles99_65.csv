The King's Speech," A serious Oscar contender!!!
","This is the first year i've had the pleasure to screen all movies as to which i think will be top contenders for this year's Oscar awards. I have been disappointed by some IE; The Social Network, but overall i think the Academy have done well in their decision making. Yes I know its a little early as the Oscar noms haven't even been delivered as of yet however The Golden Globes have and they are usually a pretty good indicator of whats to come. When i originally saw the trailer for this i had thought that this looked utterly boring as i am not a fan of the time period represented in this film although I am definitely a fan of historical true life stories and thats why i gave this a chance. I will start by saying good thing i did as I was presented by yet another favourite trait in movies i see and that being power house acting. Out of the 5 nominees in this years golden globes (for last years movies however) I have seen all but 1 in the best acting category and thats Ryan Gosling's performance in Blue Valentine and that is next on my list to do. I don't agree with two of the nominees Jessie Eisenberg and James Franco however the rest are so deserving of a win. The man who won the Golden Globe was The King's Speech's own Colin Firth. I had originally only seen Firth in a handful of things IE;Mamma Mia and the Bridget Jones movies and unfortunately have not seen his 2009 also nominated for an acting nod film The Single Man but plan to do so also. He is one of the reasons that i choose my top 5 actors and that he can damn well do a good job of making you believe he is the character in which he is portraying. Firth in this portrays King George VI who since the invention of the radio has now been forced to deliver his ailing father's speeches to the citizens of England all the midst of having a stuttering problem. His wife finds him a speech therapist Lionel Loque (Geoffrey Rush) in a bid to finally cease this impediment unbeknowst to her that Lionel and Bertie (King George's pet name given to him by his closest family members as to which Lionel insists on calling him nothing but) would not only deal with the pending speech problem but also start what will be a lifelong friendship. This movie not only shows you the value of a good strong friendship it also shows you the pressures one faces while being a royal family member.",7,1,3,19 January 2011
Moneyball," Beane pretty much changed baseball negotiations as we know them.
",Had this movie in my collection a while and finally got around to watching it today. One of the best films i have seen on the profession of baseball yet. Kudos to both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill for stellar acting jobs here. Supporting cast ain't that bad either with realistic jobs done also by Phillip Seymore Thomas (Who has a head coach look down perfectly) But both the acting jobs done by both Pitt and Hill are very believable and a storyline which was incredibly interesting and no you don't even have to enjoy watching the sport to know what's going on as i once heard a woman friend say.Pitt plays Oakland A's longtime GM and former Mets player Billy Beane. Beane is named the Oakland A's GM and attends all the draft meetings with the look of utmost boredom until one of the other brass pretty much ask him what his problem is he asks each and everyone of them if they know what the current problem is that was surrounding the team. After no one can come up with an answer he tells them that the problem especially with the Yankees is that they spend millions on all star talent who once hired don't do a thing as to where he teaches them to look at the guys who are hard workers and can actually get to the base and that are not asking for much moolah in return.Little does Beane knows is he will start what is now more or less precedent in baseball today when it comes to acquiring talent from any pro ball roster. He through yet another meeting concerning draft talks he acquires assistant Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) from The Boston Red Sox who adds his own pick and great wisdom to the then 2002 season. A good film overall that can be proudly on display with other great pro baseball film that have occurred.,7,1,1,2 December 2012
Black Swan," A years worth of movies and finally an serious Oscar contender!
","Darren Aronofsky hits another home run!! Loved Requiem For A Dream, The Wrestler, The Fountain and now this. This is a psychological thriller that place a young and very ambitious ballet dancer named Nina (Natalie Portman) who lives with her over controlling ex ballet dancer mother (Barbara Hershey) When given the chance of a lifetime to replace the star in an upcoming ballet 'Swan Lake' although the producer of the show says its a new take on the over done ballet. Nina will have to take on the duo rolls of the white swan and the evil twin the black swan. She has heavy competition for this role in the form of Lily (Mila Kunis). Incredible amounts of pressure and an influential dark side from lily, may make Nina the star of the show or a real life black swan herself. Don't think cause this film revolves around the ballet it is going to suck, cause it definitely doesn't. Its a good movie about how pressures can make you spiral into the darkness of insanity!",6,1,5,21 December 2010
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of if not the funniest movie of all time!
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan One of...if not the funniest film of all time! 4/4 stars By far one of the funniest films i have ever seen! This is such a gem as every time i watch it the end result is always side splitting laughter no matter how many times i have seen it. Sacha in his notorious 'pull no punches' brand of humour is Borat a Kazakstanian reporter, who gets sent to America by the Kazakstanian minster to collect info for his fellow countrymen, which will supposedly give them all a better understanding of the western culture and it's ways. Borat along with his sidekick/producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) arrive in the big apple as to which the duo are soon to learn that their ways and the New Yorkian ways are miles apart! If you are a fan of Cohen's British series 'The Ali G Show' and have never seen this film...what are you waiting for? Warning this film is not for the type of person who is offended easily however definitely for the people who know how",10,0,0,1 October 2012
Requiem for a Dream," Aronofsky masterpiece
","Requiem for a Dream Aronofsky's best in my opinion!! 4/4 stars Was time once again to watch this awesome film that was directed by Darren Aronofsky. I must say this is one of those movies that i can watch 100 times over and never get sick of it. Tne story of 4 people who are co dependants of different forms...drugs and eating disorders who all find out that after achieving the great highs their is always the crashing lows. Great cast includes the always great Ellen Burstyn (who if you asked me got totally robbed by Julia Roberts in Erin Brokovich that year in the Oscars) Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans. Aronofsky never even received a nod for best direction (Which in my opinion is a crime) And this all is backed by an amazing soundtrack by the Kronos Quartet (Another miss at the 73rd Academy Awards).All these things i have mentioned make this film epic and is yet another reason why Darren Aronofsky remains in my top 10 directors of all time list!",10,1,2,9 January 2013
Sucker Punch," Sucker 'packs little and no' Punch
","I thought this would be a lot better then it was. the opening segments (that best describe as a music video) were, in my opinion , the best parts of this film, and the director shouldve stuck with that storyline making it a revenge film instead of the potpourri that we end up receiving! Basic newcomer Emily Browning (Lemony Snickett's a Series Of Unfortunate Events) plays Baby Doll in this, who after being framed by her evil step father for the killing of her younger sister, gets locked away in the local mental institute (I know we all have the local institute in our towns don't we? Mine being at my house) After advising, and a hefty bribe to the the on site man in charge to lobotomize her in an effort to 'silence' her from telling the real events of what happened to her sibling, she is left alone amongst the other crazies.She befriends a band of renegade girls in the form of Rocket (Jena Malone) Amber (Jamie Chung) Blondie (Vannessa Hudgens) and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) and gets them all involved in an escape plan to the UN-escapable institute. The director (Zack Snyder, Watchmen) paints a visual portrait of once again bringing yet another graphic comic book to life. Having the main character zip in and out of her very vivid imagination, warring with huge japan like creatures, a German army of the undead (reminded me so much of a video game i once played) all the whilst back in reality these fight occur during one of Baby Doll's erotic dances. Maybe i would've given this a higher rating if i had actually read the graphic novel/comic first? However I am not into them",4,2,9,23 June 2011
Source Code," Director Duncan Jones just maybe the next Spielberg or Lucas???
","Gylenhaal seems to be travelling down the same road as Nicolas Cage in my own opinion as one of the hardest workers in the business and most underrated. I liked Source Code as it brought action, romance, drama all to the table. Newcomer director Duncan Jones who brought us 2009's Moon brings us yet another sci fi adventure this time about a US soldier Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal ) who wakes up on a train not knowing why he is there only to find himself sitting in front of his love interest in this film Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) He has taken on a hidden identity and with much arguing with Christina that he is not Colter he bolts to the bathroom to get a hold of himself only to find he is staring at a strange face in the mirror that is not his own! The train blows up and we see he is now in a pod of some sort in a US government lab. He gets told that he has only 8 mins to find a bomb aboard this train. They send him back and forth to the scene of the crime as he goes against time to find either the bomb or the terrorist who put it there! This movie reminded me in a weird sort of way of Groundhog Day with Bill Murray most of the way through it. It packs loads of twists and plot turns amidst all the action involved. A good watch for any fans of Duncan Jones previous work. He seems to be what we will soon be calling the sci fi director of the ages!",6,1,1,13 April 2011
Skyfall," Don't make Bond too real?????
","I have seen some reviews from various critics that call this the best Bond ever? Ummm in my opinion not quite however it was entertaining. Are they doing the new Bond films with Daniel Craig in storyline order? Cause we end up with both a new M which is fine, however i will miss Judi Dench in the role, and from what i believe is Bond's introduction to Moneypenny? Little confused here...so if anyone wants to shed some light feel free to message me! Anyhow.. the storyline this time round has the film starting with Bond on a job, another agent who is working alongside Bond ends up shooting 007 after a direct order comes from M (Judi Dench) to do so...007 goes missing as M comes under fire for the death of M16's best agent. It's not long before 007 once again resurfaces and comes to M's rescue as not only is she forced to retire she has also found out that a bit of nastiness from her past has risen to seek revenge.All this in an effort to save M he dives headfirst into his past pulling at all his roots to face this new enemy.. OK i'll call myself a whiny Bond fan brat here as i love all Bond's gadgetry...we only get a gun that is can only be shot by Bond himself. However the Aston Martin with machine gun turrets is back which was a pleasant surprise. Sadly though they seem to be turning Bond a little too human for my liking and not so much comic book fare as i love my British hero to be. Damn you Batman!!! What worked for director Chris Nolan is not necessarily gonna work for Sam Mendes!!!Having seen every single one of Ian Fleming's 007 films (Brosnan is still my fave bond) i will always watch these films however i can only hope that they bring back the unrealism and gadgets as that is what draws me to this franchise!",5,4,10,2 December 2012
Catch Me If You Can," Scorcese is obviously not the only one Dicaprio can hit a home run for!
","Finally sat down and watched this film starring the always awesome Leonardo Dicaprio. Great story based on actual true events revolving around the criminal career of Frank W. Abagnale (Leonardo Dicaprio) a con man who as a young boy worshipped the ground his father (Christopher Walken) walked on .His dad teaches him some lessons at a young age on how to get things for free unfortunately not knowing how far his son would run with this info. Frank's world is shattered when his parents divorce causing him to runaway and start is life of deceiving companies and people for their money, major ally from a prestigious airline. Frank learns the art of deception in the form of creating fraudulent company cheques getting it down to a science and distributing them all over various point of the globe. During his tenure he imposed as a pilot, a doctor and a lawyer all the time switching identities every time the feds especially one FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) gets too close for comfort. Enjoy the cat and mouse game as Hanratty chases Abagnale all over the world.",7,3,4,27 October 2010
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Finally sat through my first Resident Evil Film
","B' Movie? Yes! Enjoyable? absolutely! I haven't seen any of the others in this series however now i plan to watch them . The Matrx really started a trend for fast paced slow stop motion features and this one is packed with loads of moving faster then the speed of light type dodging although we seem to see it as we did in the Matrix as being slow motion. Our heroin Alice (Mila Jovavich) is back once again looking for survivors from the Umbrella Corp's deadly unleashed Zombie virus. this time running into a few of her old friends she sent off to safety only to find out they never quite made it so Alice is racing once again against time to save Claire, K-mart and the others who survived the last episode. Loads of Zombie killing fun in yet another virus strand film. In this edition to the Saga we see their is a new strand virus unleashed that has the zombie's this time omitting a flower like thing from their mouths that snatches the victim into place. It's called Las Plagus and is 100 times more lethal then the original t-virus in the last films. Once again 'B' movie fun!",5,2,5,31 October 2010
Iron Man 2," If Favreau cant even come close to his first one again, time to let someone else at bat!
","Watchable, but not close to the greatness that the first one was. sure Favreau has put in all the cool gadgetry that incorporates the world of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) however if you are going to make sequels at least don't follow suit of the Spiderman series and start making them less enjoyable as they go along! One thing i will give Favreau on this one was his brilliant decision making on casting, Mickey Rourke, Scarlett Johansson,Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell etc. etc. However the storyline is sorta ...meh! Mickey Rourke plays our villain here Ivan Vanko aka Whiplash sporting a very poor Russian accent throughout. Now that Stark has revealed he is in fact Iron Man and suffering from new health issues due to the suit, is put under a lot of stress as the government want him to share his blueprints and technology information with the military. Major problem here is when you have so much on screen talent what to do with them all and sometimes like this it turns into one giant cluster ..... However if you are a fan of cgi and an action film that packs a pretty good wallop! You should be impressed with this latest instalment to the saga. I personally hope they don't mess up the Avengers as it could be , if done right one of the all time great Marvel comics adaptations!",4,1,4,27 October 2010
Argo," Now Argo feck yourself!!!
","Argo Affleck's Argo blew me away! 4/4 stars I had a feeling upon seeing the first trailer for Ben Affleck's 'Argo' mostly due to the story within as i remember as a child still to this day watching in anticipation to the news channel as the 6 hostages were escaping the iron grip of the country Iran. I always new even back then even though at my age and still to this day the Star Wars movie was mostly in my thoughts , that the story of the escaping hostages would make one hell of a movie and thanks to Ben Affleck's directing abilities that far outshine his acting endeavours, we got a brilliantly executed story here, although with a lot of historical inaccuracies, still kept close to what actually went on during that frantic time.The Iranian hostage crisis took place from November 4, 1979 to January 20, 1981 444 days in total that ended up with then President Jimmy Carter not being voted in for yet another term in the oval office. The CIA upon hearing that the American embassy had been taken over immediately spoke to their disguise and exfiltration expert Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to figure out a way to get the '6' out of Iran and it's confines before being captured, which unfortunately if happened, would've surely meant the execution of the 6 diplomats as we all know quite well that the United States government do not answer to threats of terrorism...Mendez comes upon with the idea of enlisting a top movie producer and director to fabricate the shooting of a new sci-fi film named Argo that would go head to head with the then debuting sci fi giant 'Star Wars' with principle filming to begin in the deserts of Iran, with the end result being safely and quickly getting the '6' out of country before the Iranian militia get hold of them first.Apparently a lot of people have voiced their displeasure, mostly Canadians, saying that the film and Affleck didn't show a lot of Canada's participation in this secret mission, making it more of an American deal. Myself a Canadian didn't get bothered at all of this and actually thought that Affleck did a good job (sure their are some or should i say a lot of liberties taken with this story, you know what though? It all = up to be a damn fine edge of your seat political thriller) and Canada got their dues in reality and not those that watched the events unfold on television during those 444 days know that the States were indeed grateful for Canada's participation through to the end. Take it for what it is folks, one of the best films that 2012 has to offer.",10,3,7,29 November 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Disney and bruckheimer put out a ho hum video adaptation
","Cannot go wrong with Disney as they are rapidly becoming one of my favorite movie companies. And the same goes for Bruckheimer films. Now that being said i originally had no intention on watching this as i have been let down way too many times with video game adaptations, and yes i have played the ps2 version of this game. Then my son mentioned to me that it was a Disney film so it peaked my interest level up. Slow and drum in the beginning but it gradually sped up and turned out to be a so-so movie with loads of special effects. The storyline here has taken many liberties on the original storyline in the game, as far as i can remember that is. Good cast that has Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead pulling of an English accent perfectly. Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley both put in admirable performances but the movie lacked lustre in my eyes which would've made it so much better. I did feel although i was watching a spin off of the Pirates Of The Caribbean's films but once again this was no near as good",3,8,16,19 August 2010
127 Hours," I'm thinking i need a break from this genre!
","I have read a lot of reviews on this flick and think people are taking this film for its philosophical sense rather than my own opinion of the film which was more on the level of show me something i haven't seen before. I have said it before that the film's star James Franco will be one of the greats in the near future and i still stand by that quote 100%. One trait i like in my ever growing list of favourite actors in the biz today is the fact that they can capture the essence of the actual moment that their pertaining character they are portraying more than likely felt at that given time which is bringing a certain sense to the films of today and that is the sense that Hollyweird lacks in as of late, the sense of realism. Franco plays real life veteran mountain climber Aron Ralston, who after a mishap during one of his ventures gets trapped in a crevice in an isolated canyon in Utah. Leaving him all alone with only his own demons to conquer. I know human error leading towards the most compelling 'need to survive' stories that make it to the big screen are usually the ones that capture our hearts, however maybe i need to give this certain realm of motion picture a much needed rest for awhile. this reviewer left this film feeling meh! It was alright when most viewers were more along the lines of the wow! factor. Personal tastes i guess?",4,10,22,17 January 2011
Just Go with It," I think this will do much better on the video store shelves!
",I finally sat down and watched this last night as i am presently enjoying a lovely case of the flu. Once again a Happy Madison Pictures film that showcases all of Sandler's buddies in real life. I swear this guy thinks to himself and says 'You know what? I haven't seen my pals in awhile lets shoot a flick!' Although fellow buddy and SNL alumni Rob Scheneider must've missed the reunion memo. This time around Sandler portrays Danny a plastic surgeon who after having a rough childhood and earlier life of ridicule due to inheriting the family 'overly large nose' trait decides to make money of his own misfortune and become one of L.A's top plastic surgeons. Danny along with his assistant/ bff Katharine (Aniston) head to Hawaii with her two children in tow posing as his ex-wife in order to cover up a lie he has made to his much younger and very beautiful girlfriend Palmer (played by Brooklyn Decker) This parlays into the fish tale becoming increasingly bigger and bigger as the movie moves on with some hilarious scenes as a result of it. OK my own personal thoughts on this latest Sandler fare...hmmm? Well put it this way i have seen way better and still stand by my Sandler got missed at the Oscars announcement after seeing ' Love Reign Over Me' however this is a cutesy romantic comedy that I'm sure will do better as a DVD rental then it did in it's initial theatrical release as couples journeying into the local video store are always looking for these types of films to cuddle up with on a Saturday or Sunday night. I'm rating it a 5/10.,5,2,5,20 May 2011
Terminator Salvation," Terminator franchise lives on!
","I almost let this gem slip by without viewing it! Whatta mistake that would've been i enjoyed it almost as much as i did t2. Great casting especially the very young although very promising Anton Yelchin who sines as the young Kyle Reese. I have only seen Anton in a handful of things although what i have seen i like. Christian Bale who shines in everything he does, that being said while watching this unfortunately i had his taped rant that he made while filming this re-playing in my head and wondering what scene it was in which the gaff got in his way so to speak and Bale let him have an earful. i don't blame Bale for the rant however as i have worked on high pressure jobs and they don't bring the best in us trust me on that. Sam Worthington rounds out the great cast as Marcus Wright a death row convict who goes to his death after signing an agreement for his body to be used by sky-net for science purposes (yeah right) he figures after leading a very bad life and causing the death of his own brother it would be one good thing he could do before meeting his maker. He wakes up in 2018 amongst all the Terminator turmoil that we all have grown to love. The directors on this franchise always seem to throw in new killing machines for us to gawk at on the big screen this time We Are Marshall director McG gives us killer motor bike machines and many other metal monsters! Love this franchise and i hope they don't stop making them or don't stop making them cool i should say!",Null,0,0,15 July 2010
500 Days of Summer," Yay! for Marc Webb
","Cheers to Marc Webb for finally doing what the rest of Hollywood has seriously been ;lacking on...creativity,originality. This isn't your average romance/slash chick flick, and to be personally honest i didn't think i would get into it by watching the beginning of the film i felt oh boy another movie i have to sit through for the wife's sake but no it grew on me. I love Joseph Gordon Levitt to death and he reminds me a lot of Heath Ledger (dont ask me why) but he does. He once again does a bang on job of the very confused male (like that is rare) and Zooey Deschanel who i am still wondering how she is going to do when she stars as Janis Joplin in the upcoming bio, is the very confusing love interest here who wants a relationship without labelling it so...or at least thats what i got from her character. either that or she was afraid of commitment needless to say it was a nice change seeing the role reversal here as according to Hollywierd usually has the woman being the jaded one. thats where Marc Webbs genius comes into play. Need to mention Criminal Mind's Matthew Gray Gubler has a small part in this although being nice to see him act another character then Dr. Spencer Reid, that's unfortunately all i kept seeing every time i saw him on screen. Sorry dude your labelled.",6,0,0,16 July 2010
Sleepy Hollow," Re-viewing all the Burton films i originally hated is working so far!!
","Sleepy Hollow Re-viewing makes a lot of difference!! 2/4 stars I used to despise a lot of Tim Burton's movies thinking they were just not my cup of tea in fact i actually found a lot of them quite boring. That however was my views a few years ago and after re-watching Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which also has Johnny Depp and Tim Burton once again teaming up, it got me thinking that maybe i should give Burton's films another run in the park as most of them i only viewed once anyways. Well the first one that i saw and hated was the movie here in question that being Sleepy Hollow. I knew the general storyline from of coarse having seen it before but also from the timeless Halloween story of Ichobod Crane and The Headless Horseman.Needless to say this was a ' 2 times a charm' sort of scenario cause i was actually was quite surprised how quickly i got into this film. For those of you who haven't seen it or know nothing of the time old tale in storybooks, Ichobod Crane (Johnny Depp) a very timid (yet always acting braver then thou sort) is sent to the eerie little town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders that have a certain serial killer feel to them as the killer's tag seems to be lopping off of their heads and taking them with him as unusual trophies. Crane is soon to learn that a majority of Hollow's townspeople generally believe the be-headings are result of the famed Headless Horseman. Crane doesn't believe any of this of coarse that until he has a run in with the famed killer himself.Glad i re watched this as i am now in love with Burton for not only his directing style but also for the fact that his backdrops and sets for the different scenes are so realistic and gloomy (From what i hear a lot of Burton's own Gothic rituals are the reason this is so) He is definitely a master of his craft bringing a lot of age old stories to life through visuals and CGI. I have also noticed he seems to like working with actors that he has used in a lot of his other works as well. A stellar cast included in this one such as Christina Ricci (Who i find personally very underrated) who plays Katrina Van Tassell, Michael Gambon (Baltus Van Tassell) and last but not least(in a non speaking role) the always great Christopher Walken (as the fabled Hessian Horseman) Walken's performance is the best in this film as they have his teeth filed down(not really of course) to emit razor sharp fangs add some eerie contacts in his eye also incorporating his own wild styled hair and the end product is quite a belieavble Horseman (the scenes when his head is on of coarse)An enjoyable film that just certified that i should be reviewing a lot more of the Burton films i originally had a distaste for!!",5,0,1,2 October 2012
The Expendables," wow im very disappointed
","The most anticipated movie of this summer was a total let down. How can this be??? The script was trash. Non interesting dialogue between very cool stars. i shouldve known this would happen as it usually does with movies loaded to the brim with star power. Dolph lundgren makes Arnold Schwartzenegger look like an academy award winning actor. Hardly any martial arts with Jet Li and the main stars were Stallone and Stathum. Although i did enjoy the game at the end of knife darts between the always cool no matter what he does Mickey Rourke and Stathum. Stallone has directed and written very cool movies before such as Rocky Balboa and the newest Rambo so i don't know what the hell went wrong with this? Randy couture was surprisingly good for the short time he is on screen, i even chuckled about his ufc conditioned cauliflower ears as to which he explains comically in the film. Once again very very disappointed in this damn!!!",1,10,19,6 September 2010
The Town," Finally a movie i can hold high with Heat!
","I still don't understand all the criticizing that happens with Ben Affleck's directing and acting abilities, i mean their are a hell of a lot worse out there. I for one have enjoyed pretty much all with the exception of a few of Affleck's movies and acting performances. I am also a huge fan of a good heist film but really haven't seen a half decent one since '95's Heat. That was until i sat through this intense little stick up flick. Ben Affleck seems to be doing the directing thing as well as a lot of actors have been, i mean there is nothing wrong with trying something a little new now and then and he is good at it, first Gone Baby Gone and then this. This film is huge in talent let's see we have Pete Postlewaite, Chris Cooper, Jeremy Renner that round out the cast as well as Affleck himself who portrays Doug Macray an experienced thief who along with his team have made it a habit of taking down huge banks in the charlestown area, an area that is re known for producing bank robbers such as himself. In an accidental mishap during a heist his crew end up taking bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage until they make their getaway. Doug ends up getting into a relationship with Claire after being told by a member of his crew (Renner) to take care of her which i guess he does in his own manner. Doug and his crew are chased throughout the film by the FBI as he tries to pull off one more job and still try to run away with Claire as to which i will say no more only that it has a great shoot out scene within that rivals Heat. A great film that even Affleck haters out there should have a look at as they might just change their whole position on this underrated actor.",10,0,2,4 December 2010
Taxi Driver," In my humble opinion, Robert De Niro's best performance to date!
","I had seen this classic before which in my view pretty much stabilized director Martin Scorcese's awesome array of films. In this one Robert De Niro in a stellar performance plays Vietnam War vet Travis Bickle who due to being slightly imbalanced (now i know people will be questioning the slightly part) from the war, can't seem to sleep at nights and takes a job as a night cab driver. A lonely trade for a very lonely individual who spends the nights travelling through the scum and filth of New York's seedy underbelly seeing prostitutes, crazed patrons etc. This line of work only feeds Travis's contempt for society slowly driving him into insanity. Along the lines he meets up with a very young Jodie Foster who portrays a young prostitute named Iris. Maybe saving Iris from this wicked world just might make him a hero instead of a vengeful assassin! Stellar casting, great city speak dialogue and a director who has a great insight to the streets of New York combined to make an extraordinary film.",10,0,0,17 December 2010
Tangled," Disney keeps putting these kind of films out I will be a fan in no time!
","Omg how i moaned when the daughter wanted me to sit down and watch this with her as so i finally did and yes i will not complain again about the wonders of Disney! This was such a well put together story by the team of Nathan Greyo and Byron Howard, the same team who brought us another goody from Disney 'Bolt ' They seem to like revolving their stories about young girls who dream of being either stars or princesses. This time they take on the old fairy tale classic Rapunzel with of coarse putting their very own twist on the tale. Disney movies used to turn me off as i just couldn't get by the musical numbers that usually accompanied them however I thank the TV show 'Glee' for turning my taste patterns around, it's not such a bad thing. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore ) has been held captive due to her long magical locks of hair, in a tower, now a teenager she spends the days trying to keep herself busy amidst her tight surroundings by dreaming of stars and playing with her only friend in life a small chameleon. When a chance and surprising visit from a fleeing thief who only scaled the tower to avoid be captured by the royal guards barges into her life changing it for all the good. A great story that had me , who slowly is becoming more and more of a fan of Disney's day by day, actually wanting more as the 80 or so mins just flew by. Attention to all dad's out there... it's not that bad just give it chance!!",10,23,26,5 March 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," A lot better then the first instalment!!
","After watching the first instalment i was really surprised on how much better the second was. I swore up and down that i had no interest seeing it as i didn't really fancy the first part. However this one has way more action and better storyline to boot! The 5 are back, as the star of the show Poe, has gotten way more martial arts training and is now living his dream out as the dragon warrior. A new villain in the form of a peacock....A peacock!!! anyhow he is threatening to put a stop to both martial arts and China in general. This leads Poe, along with the furious 5 to help him dive deep into his roots to come back and conquer this new foe! Once again this instalment is much better then the first if their are any dads much like myself who are ooohing and awwing that their kids want to see this!",6,0,1,3 July 2011
Salt," Loads of twists and turns!!!
","Great espionage tale. Loads of twists and turns and i found a lot of similarities to the Bourne trilogy. Jolie must love these types of roles and why cant we have a female action hero anyways? Evelyn Salt (angelina) is a CIA operative who is heading home after a hard days work when a Russian spy just walks in off the street. After opting to stay an extra 30-45mins to interrogate this suspicious person she wasn't prepped for the can of worms she was about to open. After an astonishing statement by the Russian operative that she herself is in fact a Russian agent she flees the CIA headquarters (in interesting fashion) and this entails a huge game of cat and mouse. Director Phillip Noyce (bone collector,patriot games,sliver) gives an espionage tale that rarely has a dull moment as most of his scripts do not. Great casting with Liev Schreiber,Chiwetel Ejifor rounding out the cast.",6,1,4,22 August 2010
Shrek Forever After," Not bad definitely better then the third one!
","i liked it a lot better then the third instalment of this series thats for sure, however even though i have heard that there is no need to worry about a fourth chapter to this because the creators etc, are done. This chapter had at least a mildly entertaining storyline that has Shrek at a crossroads in his life...married children wife,donkey and the rest of his clan however he dwells on the fact of the days when he lived alone in his swamp and frightened everyone. After a breakdown he ventures off on a stroll to cool down accidentally bumping into Rumpelstiltskin on the way, Rumpelstiltskin befriends him and offers him a way to go an be a scary ogre all he has to do is give him a day of his life he cant remember. What ends up happening is he gets thrown back in time having to get Fiona to fall in love with him all over. Can he win everyone back ??? Moral of the story is be careful what you wish for..you just might get it. We didn't have the chance to see this in 3d format however it was enjoyable all the same. All these chapters of the Shrek story are missing one huge element that the first instalment contained... comedy.",4,0,1,18 June 2010
Bad Teacher," OK it wasn't the greatest however Diaz sorta makes it work!
",Cameron Diaz seems to be showing her versatility these days in the scripts she picks and i don't fully blame the crappiness of this film totally on her. Without her it would've been ten times worse in my opinion. I liked her attitude in this as it only adds to her around sexiness. Now if a director is new to making a film which contains a lot of vulgarity in it may i suggest calling up the king himself Judd Apatow and getting some suggestions on how it's done. One thing i will say for movies that promise loads of laughs and that don't deliver at least they have an entertaining script along with a storyline as to keep us watching in one way or another.,4,2,7,11 July 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Another movie the world will love but I hated!
","Am I the only person who didn't like this??? As all other people gave it 4-5 stars or so. I gave it 2 stars because of it's only perk...originality. Maybe i'm too old for this kinds sh** I don't know, I no longer read comic books and am not into nerdy films that seem to be all the rage today. Although that all being said i liked the fight between the two girls great one liners. 'I kicked him so hard he saw the curvature of the earth' I like that and plan on actually using it in an appropriate setting sometime. I like Michael Cera he is from my hometown and hometown boy makes good as he seems to be achieving quite the career in hollyweird something a lot of us only dream about. I enjoyed Kickass way more then this as i see a lot of people comparing the two.",2,32,71,30 October 2010
Alien vs. Predator," Surprisingly good!!
","AVP: Alien Vs. Predator Surprisingly Good! 3/4 stars Never had any interest in seeing this upon it's initial theatrical release as i had already saw another monster vs monster movie and thought it sucked...Freddy Vs. Jason so with that god awful movie in mind i had little and no interest in seeing yet another of my two favourite film franchises once again merge and do battle. Bored out of my mind last night flicking through the channels on my satellite i started watching the cut up movie that AMC had to offer on their Kevin Smith hosted Fear Fest (for those that do not know about what this is ...AMC usually air nothing but horror films on the weeks surrounding Halloween) Anyhoo...saw that a Predator marathon of sorts was showing along with Predator 1-2 AVP was on next so i'm it's not like i was doing anything anyhow...sigh...might as well have a look. Well i was surprised none the less on how quickly i got gripped by this movie (it helped a lot that Lance Henriksen co-starred) Although straying from both of the stories that these monsters who were yet to do battle originally came from in their individual franchises, what we get is a pretty impressive new storyline that has the Predators using an anciently buried pyramid in Antartica underneath the ice shelves. It seems many many years ago the Predators, who all the fans like myself know are hunters used to flock to this ancient site to do battle with the aliens that were grown there and those that did were considered amongst themselves to be the ultimate in warriors.Now after the pyramid was once again re-discovered as a heat blip on a map by a team of researchers who decide to start an expedition and set up camp to start drilling only once arriving to the mapped out site find that someone/thing has already made a massive tunnel down to the pyramid itself, a hole that ceased to exist not 24 hrs ago according to their maps and calculations. Of coarse our band of scientists have to scale down the already made opening and once touching down at the pyramid itself quickly find out that they are not alone down there.Great battle sequences between the two. I also found director Paul Anderson's vision of what the Predators uniform and battle helmets looked like as a much needed change form the equipment used in both Predator 1-2. Also we get to learn more and see the crab like creatures that pop out of the eggs that the queen lays, you know the ones that attach themselves to whatever crew member they find, faces and where something slides down the unwilling person's mouth laying an egg in it's stomach that grows quite rapidly, then comes crashing out of it's chosen human's chest? Well we see more of that creature's parts as well. Being a fan of both of these franchises like i had previously said...this was needless to say a cool side piece to have along with them. I enjoyed it and am going to now watch AVP Requiem as i have not seen that either.",6,2,2,29 October 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Disney hits it out of the park yet once again!
","Wreck-It Ralph Disney is awesome 3/4 stars After taking in quite a few animated films with my kids i would have to say this surprised me as i found the others duds and actually quite boring. Great original storyline that has all the bad guys from the 80's era games or 8-bit if you will meeting regularly to share the dark secrets are astonished when the bad guy and main character from The Wrekk-it Ralph game announces that he wants to be a good guy and for once be the one who gets the medal and stands on top of his famed apartment building with the tenants he saved, In Wreck-it Ralph, Ralph destroys the building whilst fix it Felix jumps up and down the building fixing all that Ralph has destroyed both antagonists racing to the top to save the tenants. Felix usually saves the day and stands proudly on top with the tenants as poor Ralph sits angrily at the bottom of the building in a puddle of mud.Ralph has had enough of this and tells Felix during a 30th anniversary celebratory party that he is done 'wrecking' and is gonna find his medal so he can be the victor for once. this starts the film leading us into something i personally imagined as a teen gamer growing up in the 80's...what it would be like to be inside the game? Ralph jumps from game to game inside an arcade...going through the wires and digital circuitry. True to his name, Ralph wrecks everything and ends up unleashing a evil force onto the gaming world and has top team up with a young 'glitch' racecar driver named Vanellope who was outcast from her car racing game 'Sugar Rush' in order to win the race and defeat the evil so all is well in gaming land yet once again.Actors lending their vocal talents to the film were John C. Reilly (Ralph), Sarah Silverman (Vanelope) Jane Lynch (Calhoun..who comes from a HD graphic FPS game and whose character was definitely drawn perfect for her) to name a few. Great CGI animation and kudos to Disney for providing a movie that the whole family can enjoy, even someone like me who doesn't really care for this genre of films. It was a very nice change then sitting bored out of mind for 1hr and 30mins.",6,0,4,17 November 2012
Bridesmaids," I think this would've been better if the director would've cast the Apatow regulars!
","I'm going to start this review by saying that this film has to be one of the highest over rated films i have seen. And please do not compare it too Judd Apatow's earlier works; Knocked Up, 40 year old virgin etc. the difference being that those films were actually funny. Now i do not know if this was due to the cast being basically newbies or what the problem was here all i know is that i was sadly misled on the laughter part. The storyline is where i actually decided to be nice and give some points for. It's original, thank god they didn't have the maids so to speak heading for Vegas or i would've walked out after the credits rolled. Apatow also didn't direct this, which is the next big mistake, don't get me wrong i like him in the producing role as well but this would've completely rocked if it were in his vision. So in short this film was OK i cant do much better then that i guess i don't take disappointment well!",5,1,2,11 July 2011
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Originality is a good thing!!!
",Although not really that funny in my opinion i gave this flick a higher rating then i usually do because its synopsis alone should garner points for originality. You got two best buddies that i guess in some circles might be known as red necks however they are just two lifelong pals who have decided to go and take a small vacation in their vacation home cabin only to be accidentally misinterpreted to a band of college kids as mountain men/ homicidal killers so to speak. These college kids have obviously seen movies such as Deliverance or any of the Wrong Turn films once too often. After Dale says enough of this * bleep* and stands up to his fears of the opposite sex and actually rescues one of the college kids from drowning Alyson all her friends think he's a backwoods killer and in definite pitches to take out Dale and Tucker they end up taking themselves out one by one including an interesting scene with a wood chipper. this leads Dale at one point to scream out in a frenzy ' whats wrong with these kids??!!' It might make most of you laugh and i think i laughed a couple of times but overall points for originality on this one.,5,9,41,13 February 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," By far the best movie of 2011!!!
",By far the best movie of 2011!!! I have seen at least one of the old Charleton Heston movies with the actors in ape suits and i was so put off that i even balked at Fox when I had heard they were doing yet another remake of this story. Then i saw the first couple of trailers of the film...wow! Now I know a lot of people will say yeah yeah CGI apes but you know what? I will take CGI apes any day of the week over real actors. When I finally got into the theatre to see this I wanted to turn right around after the ending credits rolled and re see it again. Fantastic storyline that shows how the ape colonies began under the tutelage of Ceaser an ape born from a mother who resided in a science lab that was given an experimental drug daily up until her demise leaving the young Ceaser in the hands of scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) who quietly sneaks the infant primate into his household to look after and raise along with his dementia suffering father Charles (John Lithgow). A real awesome action thriller!,Null,0,1,16 August 2011
The Mist," Wowsers!!! I he only waited 5 more mins!!!......
","Just re-watched this and i have to say overall my favourite Stephen King novella adaptation yet! Great acting revolving around what if... type scenarios. We all know the U. S. government are always up to secret stuff and what if they were experimenting with per say other dimensions and time travel only to have opened another dimension and not close the porthole so to speak allowing a mist that contains all these third dimension creatures to escape into our world?? Well we see first hand what happens when a tiny close knit community living at the bottom of a huge army base atop of a mountain allows a mist filled with what i described above to wreak havoc. Trapping a majority of its citizens in a small grocery store together. Lets see in this grocery store we have the citizen with a chip on his shoulder and because he is the only person of colour that the whole town is secretly plotting against him, the town biker, the grocery store manager who despite all thats happened still gives one of his employees heck for drinking beer on the job ( if you see what kind of creatures and humongous type insects this mist produces i know would it make myself wanna tip back a few!) We also have the town crazy woman/ head bible thumper Mrs Carmody holed up with them turning a few of the trapped shoppers into her own personal cult following. Mrs Carmody is played with great conviction by Marcia Gay Harden. This besides being a great thriller it is packed full of CGI creatures providing pretty good realism to the film.",10,1,5,13 February 2011
School of Rock," Jack Black's finest work by far
","By far my favorite Jack Black movie! And no i am not just seeing this now quite frankly its like the 500th time i have seen it.However only noticed today that no review was attached by moi...so lets remedy that shall we? I have seen pretty much every project that has had Jack Black's moniker on it and i still haven't seen anything as good as the performance he gives within this film. Dewey Finn (Black) is an aging rocker who gives it all behind the mic! After being told that he is fired from his band and that he needs to come up with rent money pronto or no home as well. He intercepts a phone call originally for his roommate (a substitute teacher) and after learning that a nearby private school requires a teacher to fill in for a couple of weeks he pretends to be his roommate and accepts the job. Before you know it he is teaching the students how to be free and shake the image of strictness,let their hair down and just play some metal! He turns the class into a band themselves finally giving him his spotlight thats he has always desired. the one thing of many that this movie made me want to do was look into an obviously talented musician that i didn't know until viewing this film that Jack Black is, which in turn led me into becoming a fan of Blacks own comedy type band with his lifelong friend Kyle Gass and that is Tenacious D. These are the movies i think should be really looked at as hidden gems. Not only for the family but for the hidden rock star in us all!",10,1,2,29 June 2010
Cars 2," Another great visit to Radiator Springs and other places!
","I like these Cars movies and this one was just as good if not a tad better than the original! This time the directors John Lasseter and Brad Lewis bring a few new characters to the mix as in Francesco (an indy type car) who after Mater's ( this time voiced by Larry The Cable Guy) bating challenges Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to race him in a championship race in his home country of Italy. Also new to the mix are Pixar's version of James Bond's 007, Finn Mcmissile (Michael Caine) and M Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) two British top super spies who find unknown and very hidden espionage talents within Mater's rusty parts. This second visiting with all the folks of Radiator Springs, brings us more of Mater then Lightning, which some have found annoying, i remember reading one critics review in which he wrote that Pixar had found their very own Jar Jar Binks. Well I for one like the Mater character and found he along with the little forklift that assists him at the garage only adds to the laughs. If you and your family loved the first one then you will definitely love this one as well. I love all the Pixar films and always say bravo to them upon every review!",7,3,5,28 June 2011
Kick-Ass," Movie does indeed do what the title says
",Interesting to say the least! If only Tarantino had gotten his little creative paws on this before Matthew Vaughn did we would have really seen some kicking ass....Needless to say I thought it dragged a bit and was going to be beyond ridiculous but like Shoot Em Up did it eventually grew on me and then some. I will say this and that Chloe Moretz has a dirty little mouth for her age lol but Hit Girl should've been the main feature in this graphic comic book adaptation. I loved the dynamic duo of her and her dad (nic cage) in this. It was also a cool original storyline which if anyone has the same tastes as me in film will love this. Loads and loads of guns and violence mixed up in a bowl always adds for pure enjoyment on my part.,4,13,28,12 May 2010
Unknown," Its scary that people can actually play with your mind like this!
","I am now thinking that you cannot lose when putting your hard earned cash down on a movie starring Liam Neeson! When he first started doing leads in flicks i was only used to his character work and so i unfairly labelled him. He seems to bring it every time much like Harrison Ford used to ( I often compare the two, not looks wise but just their choices are very similar when it comes to their choices in dramatic thriller scripts. Jaume Collet-Serra has the directing duties here (known for Orphan, House Of Wax) and he brings us the story of one man's plight to restore his identity amongst many obstacles. Apon arriving in Berlin Germany, Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) and his wife Liz (January Jones) go to check into a hotel, just as they are entering the hotel, Martin acknowledges the fact that his briefcase with all his passports and various items of importance has been left behind at the airport without notifying Liz of the fact he jumps into a cab in a rush effort to return to the airport to collect it. Along the way there the cab he is in becomes involved in a accident. Dr. Harris is rushed to the hospital where he awakes 4 days later with a splitting headache but all the same he rushes out of the hospital in a bid to get back to his (who by now should be dealing in 3 degrees of hysteria) He arrives back at the hotel only to have his wife not know who he is and she is accompanied by another man Dr. Martin Harris! Will the real Dr Harris stand up seems to be the basis to this storyline as we spend the rest of the time as Liam Tries to prove he is who he is. Another flick featuring loads of plot twists and turns. I am beginning to slowly fall in love with Hollywood again",10,10,22,23 February 2011
Brave," Not my cup of tea but good for the kids
","This to me was like reviewing Brother Bear once again except this time it's the main character's mother who turns into one, a bear that is. Aside from that this film did little and nothing for me but then again i'm not the target audience here, now the target audience (my kids) they both loved it so that's a good thing. Although being no fan myself of this family genre of films, only a few seem to capture my interest, I still look for great storytelling and found the storyline in this flick completely dull although i do have to say anything Scottish always keeps me somewhat entertained. I will say if you have a family and are looking for a movie night movie to watch then select this one however if you are a dad much like myself, who watches these films strictly for the kids only hoping to luck out and enjoy it myself, remember one thing...it's all about the kids!",2,0,5,11 November 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Romance or sci-fi thriller ? You be the judge!!
",OK i'll start this review by saying that if this film doesn't get your wheels turning i don't know what will. It's hard to review a flick of this stature without ruining or giving away the outcome. However its pretty good for plot twists and turns that's one thing i don't mind giving away at all. Romance/ sci-fi is what i would categorize this kinda reminded me of a twilight zone episode i had seen before but cant quite recall what it was entitled. Could you quite possibly foresee that all human's have a pre directed path they are supposed to follow during their lives? And if they fall off of this designated path their is someone or some unseen force guiding them back on path as you cannot cheat destiny or can u? This film brings to life the saying of if it was to happen it would happen and if it doesn't it was never to be.,10,3,6,13 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," If you put a coat on a dog isn't it the same dog?
","Well this is one time i should've listened to the other critics, i knew going into seeing this that it was the Hangover part 2 hence the some of the similar things that occurred in the first one would re-occur in the second..I didn't realize all of them would re-occur! My god its like they took the first instalment and just put a fresh coat of paint on it and moved it to an exotic locale to get people into the seats. The first one was hilarious, so that being said will be enough to make this instalment some money although i highly doubt that anyone will bother if they decide to make a 3rd as they no longer have their element of surprise and i wouldn't be surprised if it goes straight to DVD rental. That being said, this movie has some funny moments although far and between as we see that Stu (Ed Helms) the dentist is the one getting married this time round and his fiancée's family reside in beautiful Thailand. Due to the horrors that occurred during Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party, he has decided he wants his wedding nice and quiet and has decided not to invite anyone. Apon hearing that Phil (Bradley Cooper) guilts him to inviting all his buddies including Allan (Zack Galafinakis) They all arrive and everything looks swell with even Stu starting to chill out by the fire on the beach as all the buddies are together. Stu says you know what? Sorry for not wanting you guys to come this is really nice. Flash to the next morning and the boys are all waking up with huge heads and that feeling of 'not again!' Hence the title it's time for Hangover 2. My biggest problem is, and yes i know that its title is the second hangover however i expected at least some new ideas. The laughs are there however nowhere near the breath taking laughter that i exhumed upon seeing the original. So if you are a fan of the original i say you have been warned",3,2,5,5 June 2011
Avatar," Another Spell Binding Vision From Director Cameron
","Finally got to experience Cameron's vision and what a vision it was!! I am not going to holler and cry that this was a major over sight when it came to the best picture award (but The Hurt Locker beat this??? Come on???) James Camerons masterpieces are nothing short of eye popping when it comes to visuals, his cinematography and use of cgi only add to a realistic journey anytime i sit through one of his films. In short i think he would be the only director that could afford to do these type of films ha ha!. The only problem i have with this feature is that i didn't drag the family out to see it in 3d in the theatre, and was also told that if i enjoyed it on my 61' hi definition TV think of it as only being a fraction of how i would've enjoyed it in the theatre. Damn! maybe i will get lucky and they will re release it sometime in the hopefully near future. Great casting here as well. Major kudos to Stephen Lang, it takes a major actor to make you actually hate his character and he succeeds with little work. I will be purchasing this on blue-ray very shortly!",10,3,7,6 June 2010
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Good ending to a disappointing series of films.
","This is one book to movie adaptation (Although a cash grab as this story could've been easily told within one movie) that i would love to say what i usually say and that is the book was better but you know what? I can't as the ending gives you more or less the Meyer version that is the book and you get director Bill Condon's version as well that entwine quite well actually. So a two for one type ending is not a bad thing in a movie world that provides so little these days. The film starts pretty much where 'Breaking Dawn Prt 1' left off.. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is dealing with two major life changing things in her life..1..Becoming a newborn vampire and two...becoming a mommy to a baby girl named Renesme (The worst storybook name i have ever seen) who seems to, due to the fact that she is half vampire/half human, have powers of her own such as mind reading and levitation, she also has starting ageing rapidly. So all these things considered she has to still come up with an idea on what to tell her dad Charlie (Billy Burke) who only thinks she is still ill from her and new beau Edward's (Robert Pattinson) 's honeymoon trip. Needless to say a lot has gone on in short time in her life.The Cullen family thanks to Alice (Ashley Greene) are soon to find out that one of their cousins has seen Bella walking Renesmee, and her powers as she flies up to touch a falling snowflake, the cousin informs the powerful sect The Volturi of this new edition to the Cullen family with inquisitions and questions they all come looking for the Cullens. This sets off Alice and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) to find who they believe is the only other hybrid like Renessmee to hopefully avoid war with the Volturi.A good ending to a series of films that in my mind were more off then on. Hey at least they ended it properly in my mind. Maybe Condon should've directed the lot?? Who knows?",6,0,7,25 November 2012
Super 8," I saw this film at 3 am at the drive in so i will be re-watching sometime soon
","OK when i heard the ratings on how well this film was doing it only hyped me all the more to see this film. There are a couple of films around that i will give second chances too and i think this will be one of them cause i was disappointed. Number one i saw this as part of a quadruple bill at the local drivein and it was the 3rd in the lineup and started approximately at 3 am so tiredness was in effect. Number two i believe the screen was dark and this being packed with a lot of night scenes made it hard to see. I was also disappointed in the alien, although didn't see it very well. Sure as other posters have put, the characters, acted by unknowns, are believable but this came across as a Goonies/stand by me type movie and maybe after following Transformers 3 in the quad of movies i was viewing just wasn't the time and place for a movie of that stature. So for now i'm rating it only 1-1/2 stars until later when it comes on DVD. Nice to see J.J. Abrams back in the directors seat!",4,0,1,3 July 2011
Sinister," Trailer was scarier!
",Sinister Trailer is scarier than the actual product!! 2/4 stars I guess seeing this in the theatre up on the big screen would make this more scary then it was (I was privileged enough to see a home copy that was lent to me by a friend of mine who gets screeners sent to him) However that being said i would have to say over all the film itself was creepy but i guess i don't scare that easily as i only jumped once or twice (Unlike movies like the Paranormal films where you can find me plastered to the ceiling) the scariest thing about this flick was the soundtrack...plan on looking for a copy of this to buy and play on the next Halloween!I also have to mention that the storyline here was one of the creepiest i have seen in a while... Ethan Hawke portrays true crime novelist Elison Oswalt who after having a run of bad books moves his family of 4 into a house that the former tenants also a family were hung from a tree (Elison finds the footage from this grisly murder along with other Super 8 murders in his attic) this spurs on his next writing project and gets caught up in watching the films that he has found for his homework. The more films he watches however the more supernatural activity keeps occurring in his new home.The death of the family that lived there before is still being investigated as the daughter of the family has disappeared something Elison hopes to uncover whilst writing his next book. Investigating this crime puts his family at danger of course.Overall a very creepy film however light on the scare factor in my opinion.,4,1,3,3 December 2012
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's Best ......#1
","One thing this Tarantino classic is brilliant for is the script alone. Tarantino is by far the best in the business when it comes to on screen characters and written dialogue! Reservoir Dogs is excellent proof of that and is one of the best casted movies that i can remember in a long time. Chris Penn (rip) who i thought wasn't that great of an actor during his short lived career, however he was brilliant as well. If you have never seen any of Tarantino's work, then i definitely suggest starting here as it will only leave you either wanting more or not. You see you either love Quentin or you don't their doesn't seem to be any in between. I myself before seeing this for the first time (RD was my very first Tarantino film ) did not like to sit through films that were heavy in dialogue as i found them immensely boring. That changed and was only cemented after also viewing his Pulp Fiction (Another character/dialogue enriched film).For those who have yet to see this cinematic masterpiece let me fill you in a bit. 7 men all hired by crime thief expert Joe Cabot to perform a job on a jewelry store that has according to sources a load of diamonds that just came in from Brazil, after the job goes very badly the men who survived the aftermath shootout with the police were to show up at the rendezvous point. We get three of the men Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) pulling a badly injured Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) who had taken a bullet to his belly who are at the rendezvous point first and let the dialogue roll... All of the men seem to believe that the heist was a setup but have to unfortunately stay put until the arrival of Joe Cabot to tell them further instructions.Kudos here to Michael Madsen who portrays, most excellently the psychotic Mr. Blonde aka Vic Vega who was definitely my favourite character in the film. This is a movie i can easily watch 1000 times over and over again as it remains as one of the best films i have ever seen!",10,0,0,8 November 2012
Limitless," Im starting to take a liking to Bradley Cooper!
",An original script is what i have been craving Hollyweird to produce for quite sometime. In 'Limitless' they have succeeded. Bradley Cooper who i have been taking a real shine too ever since first seeing him in ' The Wedding Crashers' plays starving author Eddie Morra who whilst taking a walk in between his bouts with writer's block bumps into his ex-brother in law they go for a drink together to do some catching up. After listening to Eddies troubling world he slides over a small baggy containing one pill as to which he advises Eddie that if taken instead of the normal 20% of his brain any human being normally uses on any given day he will in fact be able to use all 100% of it. Eddie leaves the bar looking at the pill and figures what has he got to lose and downs it. Before we know it Eddie has changed from a derelict to Albert Einstein in the midst of his Landlord's evil girlfriend virtually laying into him verbally. He totally feels awake and renewed and smart as a whip. This leads us down the path with him as his life takes an incredible upswing. Just remember though what comes up must also come down. Several people from different types of employment are now chasing Eddie for this wonder drug. I thought this was a breath if fresh air as like i said earlier in this review that Hollyweird in my eyes had grown into a stalemate of sorts. Director Neil Burger who last brought us 2006's ' The Illusionist ' regroups himself to give us this ever so excellent thriller.,7,0,1,10 April 2011
Thor," I didn't think he could do it but Chris Hemsworth nailed the role!!
","Although having originally balked at director Kenneth Branagh for casting Chris Hemsworth in the lead of this film, i have to say i was presently pleased with the job he did in this. Now as you will see in this version Chris Hemsworth is ribbed and cut however I was hoping he would've used a wrestler such as the likes of Paul (Triple H) Levesque he's way more massive in the body building sense then Hemsworth is. Im sure however that Hemsworth is a better actor. Needless to say the film rocked and turned out to be one of the better comic book adaptations i have seen to date. Branagh carefully handpicked his cast in this with the end product proving this immensely. After being cast out of his mystical city of Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor is sent to earth with his famed hammer. He is befriended by scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and with her team they follow Thor as he treks to find his hammer. Upon finding the mystical and powerful weapon he cannot seem to pull it from its place embedded in earth. This leads him and his friendly band of scientists to find out as to why he has come to earth and deemed powerless. It takes a powerful Asgardian foe that comes down to earth to destroy Thor and with malicious intent to do more harm then good to earth's mortal citizens, to give Thor what he needs to conquer and rejoin his father as a King in Asgard! Kenneth Branagh in his first comic book super hero genre type film did a superb job in retelling what is one of my favourite heroes that the great Stan Lee crafted in his comic book series. Seeing Thor only left me craving to see 2012's The Avengers that will be directed by Joss Whedon.",8,9,18,10 May 2011
American Gangster," Great true story with little fabrication!!
","Personally i think that director Marty Scorcese is the king of this genre however will have to admit that Ridley Scott did a fine job here, alleviating from his usual sci-fi genre that he also directs so well. American Gangster is the rags to riches story of former drug king pen during the 70's Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington). After being a driver for 15 years for then Harlem king pin Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III) Bumpy dies leaving Lucas to take over his business . In a rather ballsy movie, he decides to eliminate the middle man (the mob) and buy the drugs from the war torn country of Vietnam himself. Now i personally have watched a load of films on drug trade and trafficking, usually finding a majority of them quite cool and somewhat fascinating, however there is nothing cool or fascinating about creating false bottoms and using the coffins of dead soldiers returning home from that dreadful war as ways of getting his product (heroin) into the U.S. in fact that was despicable. The other half of this tale comes to us in the form of broken down do gooder detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) A cop who has, aside from a failed marriage, a bad time with his fellow officers after Roberts searches an abandoned vehicle and finding no less then 1 million in cash stowed away in it's trunk turns it in to his precinct as it was 'The decent thing to do' Robert's upon hearing smidgeons of information about the goings on of Frank Lucas decides to team up with a few of his fellow officers that he can still depend on to spend the rest of the film doing surveillance, wire taps etc to bring Lucas's drug empire to a halt. After watching this film i decided to research a little as i usually do during a real life event flick as to see how much was shinola. From what i read it seems that Scott's team did a pretty good job depicting the events around these two individuals lives however there is of coarse the usual fabrications...this is Hollywood remember? I enjoyed American Gangster immensely and think it deserves to be up on the movie shelf right alongside movies that are already there Goodfellas, The Godfather trilogy and Scarface.",6,1,2,5 November 2012
Inception," Christopher Nolan bats another one out of the park!
","Like many others have said about this film is that its a complicated plot but not that hard to follow or concentrate on. Leonardo Dicaprio (Another actor in Lee's top 10) is the star of the film in yet another visual masterpiece from my new favourite director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) In this he portrays Cobb a Dream specialist who with a team he personally assembled of other dream experts except jobs from high rollers to either invade someone's dreams and steal something per say a combination to a safe that they only know etc etc. Or his team can do Inception jobs, go in a person's dreams and place an idea in their minds for something that a person per say in the real world knows they are capable of and just need a little push in the right direction. Great stellar cast that is rounded off with Joseph Gordon Levitt, Ellen Page, Ken Wantanabe and the always great Cillian Murphy.",5,3,5,1 December 2010
The Blind Side," Sandra Bullock owns this role
","Who was to know that #74 for the Baltimore Ravens Michael Oher had a history like this. I didn't even know that this movie was about his life and his adoptive family the Touhys till i saw it. What a movie it is very inspirational and a must see for any poor street kids out there that would rather spend the time making something out of themselves then spend the time planning drive bis with their posse. Michael Oher's parents were definitely not the Cleavers his mother a crack addict and mother of 12 children and his father an inmate at a local penitentiary who he was taken from at a very young age by children's services during a police raid on his home went through ( to put it mildly) a few years of hell until interior designer Leigh Anne Touhy on one freezing thanksgiving night find Michael walking to find shelter in only a t shirt in freezing cold weather offer their home and to share thanksgiving dinner with them, eventually taking him and adopting him. They give Michael all the warmth and care of a family that he so longed for and end up signing him up for football. That starts what is now after the 2009 entry draft into the NFL,l history. We need more people and stories like his out there the world would be a much better place! It would be nice to see Sandra Bullock who actually became Leigh Anne Touhy during this film to win the Oscar it would be her first if she does. Absolutely see this flick its a winner all the way around.",10,0,2,3 August 2010
Prometheus," Puzzling to say the least!!!!
","Prometheus (2012) Puzzling...to say the least!! 2.5/4 stars OK after seeing this film i guess the synopsis should read... for those that like movies that resemble a 1000 piece puzzle. After seeing this film you will see what i mean as we are shown a lot by director Ridley Scott but not given much in answers which along with the ending leads me to believe that Scott plans to direct a sequel sometime in the future. Hey! If your first venture doesn't make money add loads of plot holes so you will be forced to spend money and see the the next part and so forth and so on. another thing i don't understand is why are people calling this an 'Alien' prequel as it has little and nothing to do with any of the Alien quadrology...OK maybe a little segment in the end that i wont mention in case you haven't already seen this film, needless to say it's the only smidgen of Alien evidence that i caught anyways. Not bad but give us answers next time round Ridley!",4,1,3,3 November 2012
X-Men: First Class," The best Marvel comics franchise out there!
","Another fantastic 2011 summer release! The thing i like with this and the Transformers franchise is they only keep getting better and better! This instalment being a prequel tells a lot of the origins of Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Xavier (James McAvoy) and how the good and bad alliances were formed. Another great one for fans of Cgi (As i am ) The story turns back the clocks to 1960's during the time of the missile crisis between the US and Russia! As World War 3 seems eminent, both Magneto and Professor X work together as a villain Sebastian Shaw (played brilliantly by Kevin Bacon) plans on using his powers to use WW3 to eliminate the human race altogether making earth a planet for mutants only. A great prequel which in my mind could be used also as a vessel for more prequels if Matthew Vaughn hopefully wants to. To me this is the best comic book super hero franchise presently going and i hope to keep seeing more!",10,3,7,9 July 2011
Toy Story 3," OK stop making Shrek movies and spend more time on Toy Story!!!
","I have yet to see a Toy Story flick i hate. I mean they keep getting better and better and the ending had me teary eyed if you can believe that??? It's toys for god's sake!!! There are several items that make this franchise work...#1 Great writers over at Pixar loved all their stories aside from Ratatouillie #2 smart casting on the voice talent...were all time consumingly carefully selected. #3 Toy Story can never get boring due to the fact that they can always find different and older toys we haven't seen or used in centuries to add to the mix. All these make for the perfect family adventure. This story unfolds with the toys recollecting a moment in time during one of Andy's play time scenarios, Actually the opening scene in Toy Story 1 you remember.. Black Bart..little BO peep's sheep strapped to the railroad tracks??? And then our story turns to present time and we see the toys struggling with the fact that Andy who is now 18 is leaving for college. In a huge mistake a garbage bag of toys that were supposed to be headed for the attic get sent to the local daycare to unfold a whole new heap of adventures as once again Woody,Buzz and the rest of the gang try their best to get back to Andy before its too late. A good story with a touching ending that the whole family will love as the Kyle family did. To sum things up i say once again Bravo!!!Pixar!!!!",Null,2,3,29 June 2010
RED," the old timers are sometimes the best timers!
","Now that was cool! Having seen the trailer for this the last time we were at the movie theatre I was kinda like... I don't know? It's one of those movies i just said hey, what the heck? and walked in to see. Good thing too cause this is a crafty little story about 4 retired black ops members who reunite after the government they worked so hard for and trained them are now trying to eliminate them before they expose a botched up war mission that an elected official ordered the slaying of a bunch of people illegally. The youngest member Frank (Bruce Willis) has been having a tough time dealing with retirement. In a lonesome bid he constantly rips up his pension cheques as so he can talk to government worker Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) well in customer service you always are wondering who you are talking to at the other end of the phone. Instead of asking Sarah for a date she ends up in a crazy journey with Frank as he and the other members of team Red Joe(Morgan Freeman) Victoria (Helen Mirren ) and Marvin (John Malkovich) go up against the lies of the Cia and the secret service in order to bring a highly elected official to justice. Greatstoryline with a fantastic cast involved. I personally find Willis's current career path a little more on the miss side then the hit side these days, but make no doubts about it this one hits a home run!",6,1,2,29 October 2010
Flight," Definitely an Oscar contender
",Upon originally seeing the trailer for this (Aside from getting excited as i always do when one of my top 5 fave actors of all time star in something) I thought it would be a total up in the air type film revolving around an epic plane crash. Sure their is an epic crash (Due to the amazing job done by the film crew it looked totally real) however this story revolves about pilot William 'Whip' Whitaker (Washington) a divorced heavy drinking/partying who has with that life style surprise surprise a drinking problem. This movie tends more to be about addiction and how it is more a disease then a problem. Kudos to John Goodman who i thought was simply brilliant as Whip's drug dealer Harling (Laughed at how he presented himself you have to see the movie yourself to see why) Aside from that most of the all-star cast did pretty solid acting jobs.With award season almost under our noses i can definitely see this as being a strong contender with Denzel more than likely garnering yet another statuette for his shelf at home in the best acting dept.,8,1,1,5 January 2013
Final Destination," Wow, Hollyweird can be original???!!
","The first instalment of this ever so cool franchise. Although i find this the weakest one of the lot it still is very cool and stars the seldom seen underrated actor Devon sawa. These movies in this film have such an intense yet true story to tell. You cant cheat death, when its your time its your time and there is nothing you can do about it. When horror/thrillers were at there all time low (god they are doing this storyline again?) out came this film by director James Wong , an original idea something Hollyweird has been lacking of for the last 10 or so years. This original instalment has a school trip to Paris France , all the students are boarding and getting their seats when young Alex Browning drifts off and has a scary but unseemingly real dream that the plane is going to explode he and a few people who are either caught in his paranoia or believe him get escorted off the plane as to which they all watch in terror as the plane explodes just after take off. Did Alex save them? Maybe for now however the moral of these films and the story here is when your time is up your time is up. If you are one of the few who haven't had the pleasure of viewing any of the films in this ever so excellent series then i totally suggest you give these a try all 4 instalments. They only get better and better.",7,1,2,30 June 2010
Get Him to the Greek," Jonah Hill/Russell Brand are hilarious together.
","Once again Jonah Hill stars in another hilarious flick, I haven't yet been let down by this dude. Nicolas Stoller who recently did the poorly Fun with Dick And Jane and Yes Man with Jim Carrey redeems himself in this film about a record executive intern who is looking to make a name for himself and with his boss Sergio Roma (Sean Puff Daddy Combs) by taking a washed up rock star (Russell Brand) and bringing him to the famous Greek Theatre in Los Angeles for a reunion concert that will more then likely revitalize his career. Aaron Green (Hill) goes through the stereo typical drugs, women world that rock stars live in and tries to keep a relationship thriving with his live in girlfriend all the whilst trying to get Aldous Snow (Brandt) to the concert on time. Once again Jonah Hill does an awesome and comedic job, but i was very surprised on how funny Sean Combs was as his' do anything to get the job' done boss. There are loads of cameos through this and Russel Brand's comedic stylings to round up what is one funny film.",10,2,5,28 September 2010
Fast Five," Ranks up right up there with the first one!
","Wow although being a huge 'mark' for Dwayne Johnson when he portrays The Rock in the WWE i have to say his movies as of late have been nothing less then sucky. Well that all changed tonight due his newest flick Fast Five. Dwayne definitely has stick this action genre and he will be OK in my book. He's cool he's muscular and has all the bows and ribbons of a bonified action star. Pair him up with the likes of Vin Diesel another actor who needs to stick to the action genre and you have what is a little over 2hrs of sheer packed fun. Although not being overly impressed with parts 2-4 this one ranks right up with the original only lacking in car races. Now i said car races not chases and this flick is filled with em. Most of the original regular cast (minus the ones who have been killed off in previous chapters) show up for this instalment and a few from the other sequels such as Tyrese Gibson as Roman Pierce (2fast2 furious) and Tej played by Ludicrous another 2 fast memory of sequels gone past. After reuniting with Vince (played once again by Matt Schulze) who is now living in Rio with his love interest and his child. Its not long before the old team are back at it this time putting their heads together to pull off a which leads to be a 'Ocean's 11' worthy heist of the big political villain who pretty much runs Rio Dejeinero, Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida). Dwayne Johnson, like i said rounds off the cast playing the lead Marshall who has been hired to hunt down and arrest Dominic and his crew. Any fan of this series should really be happy with this latest instalment that really hasn't lost any of its staying power yet in my opinion in fact to the contrary its gained life. I could see them doing more of these.",7,0,1,29 April 2011
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Haterz who see it anyways???? Its for the fan's guys!
","The wife and i just watched this and boy let me tell you, never mind what the critics are saying, these movies keep getting better and better. Another favourite for 2010 and believe me it's a small list. This and Toy Story 3....that's it! If you haven't read any of the books of Stephenie Meier(although i suggest you do so) you don't need too because the storyline follows very closely to the book. Something book adaptations as of late have failed miserably in doing. Great Cgi only left me drooling for 2011-12's Breaking Dawn the last in the series. Critics have also said that the casting is terrible another thing i highly disagree on considering once again if you are a fan of this series in print as I am you will know that all were cast perfectly right down to Kristen Stewart as Bella as she is as awkward in real life as Bella is in the Twilight story lines. Funny listening to the teenybopper set of girls that were set directly behind me gasp every time Taylor Lautner graced the screen (shirtless of course) Which even had fellow cast mate Edward asking 'Does he own a shirt?' Taylor if you are unfamiliar with these films plays Teen wolf Jacob Black in this. This chapter opens up with various people in Seattle going missing which in turn raises flags amongst the Cullens as being far too familiar and want to do something about it before the Volturi step in. Red head (as Jacob labels her)Victoria (this time played with perfection by Bryce Dallas Howard) is still stalking Bella, in retaliation for Edward killing her mate in the first one James. The future seeing vamp Alice keeps getting visions of the new vamps titled the newborns and Victoria making their way to Forks for a major fight, which in turn has the Cullen's seeking help from Jacob's werewolf brothers. Can Jacob and Edward, who are having their own game of tug o war going on with Bella, bond together with their clans and fight together and protect Bella? Don't want to spoil anymore then i have of this but i do say go see it, u wont regret it!",1,1,9,10 July 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Unpredictability at it's finest!
","If this flick is anything it's unpredictable and that's a good thing cause originality these days in ole Hollyweird is extremely rare! I had no idea whatsoever that the events that i was about to see were gonna take place. I love horror films and have seen quite a few strictly for the gore factor (Yes I'm sorta crazy that way i guess?) have seen some that have actually scared the bejesus out of me (Paranormal Activity is one of them) and last but not least hardly any that shocked me, unpredictability wise as this one had. 5 college buds head up to one of their cousin's cabin in the woods. Sure...I know same ol same ol eh? Low and behold we then see a group of what look to be scientists in a lab who seem to be controlling what comes up against the 5 pals whilst up there. They also seem to be laying down bets on the 5 on who will be the first to meet their demise and how they will fall.Eventually the tables get turned on them however, with thrilling CGI results. I suggest this film for any horror fan who thinks they have seen it all, cause quite frankly they have not.",5,0,2,4 October 2012
The Runaways," My first major letdown of 2010
","Aside from The Expendables this was the only other movie i was looking forward to in 2010. This was also the first major disappointment of 2010 movie wise. The starting scenes to this movie have Roxxi Roller wailing as the background music, so I'm thinking wow this is going to be so cool....well it started to falter from there. I love Dakota Fanning as she seems to be the next break through star however her lacklustre performance in this was only a chip of my problems with this film. First of all there were 5 girls in The runaways not two although after seeing the credits i can see why Joan Jett herself executive produced this project. The ending credits has what Joan and Cherie did for the rest of their careers once again.....what happened to the other 3 girls? As being an old fan of Lita Ford i think she did quite lucratively for a spell??? One unfortunate is that Scout Taylor Compton who portrays Lita in this didn't have a bigger role in the film as she is another astounding break through actress. Alas Lita Ford didn't want anything (for reasons unknown) to do with this film. This is my first feature from director Floria Sigismindi and will be my last if she directs any more movies like this. There is a rainbow in this however and that alone is Michael Shannon's portrayal of slimy Runaways manager Kim Fowley I have seen things in the 80s on the real Fowley and Shannon pretty much nailed it! Stewart was impressive at times as Joan Jett who apparently was side by side through the making of this with her. Stewart seems to nail all of Jetts queaks and quirks and does an honourable job here. The rest of the movie pretty much left a bad taste in my mouth. Give the script to Scorcese and lets get a good bio about the band.",Null,3,9,21 June 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformers the ultimate in action films!!!
","Fan 'freakin' tastic!!!! How anyone in their right mind could condemn this series and say bad things about it is beyond my point of rational thinking! State of the art beyond realistic CGI, action coming out of your ying yang with characters of epic proportions. In this latest gem from cream of the crop action director Michael Bay, after a series of events in the States history of Moon landings, the evil Decepticons, still ruled with an iron fist (no puns intended) by the villainous Megatron(voiced by the ultimate villain actor Hugo Weaving) plan on turning earth itself into their new home planet of Cybertron. Great storyline, great cast and great pretty much everything!!!!!",10,2,6,2 July 2011
The Social Network," Another movie favoured by everyone...except me!
","Sadly enough yet another movie that everyone is going to love and i will be when asked if i saw 'the face book movie?' question going ' meh it was alright!' So many movies that people rave and rave about that i have seen myself, it actually makes me wonder sometimes if its just me or does anyone know what a good movie actually is? Sure i'm a Facebook fan and have a profile in fact that's how i type out all these reviews i do for flixster. The story itself is a remarkable one about one man's luck and the battle for corporate greed that ensues. A solid cast, i'm getting more impressed with Justin Timberlake the more i see him as he seems to be upping his game as well as Jessie Eisenberg who portrays Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in this film. It pretty much swept last night's golden globes and from what i hear they are a prelude of whats to come for the big night at the Oscars. I personally am rooting for The Fighter myself as i enjoyed it way more than this. Maybe 'im too old fashioned...who knows?",4,1,3,17 January 2011
The Fighter," Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Melissa Leo all deserve awards for their performances in this
","Christian Bale should be at least nominated for his performance in this. I simply love boxing movies most likely due to the fact that any sorta fighting sport is definitely my cup of tea. Having seen both raw footage of the actual Micky Ward on you tube and the documentary HBO put out on crack addicts that starred his brother and occasional trainer Dicky Ecklund ( Christian Bale). for those of you who have seen this film and are wondering if his life and family were that rough around the edges would definitely suggest you see the documentary. Mark Wahlberg who portrays our star Micky Ward pretty much plays himself in this character with nothing special to add. Really impressive was not only Bale's performance but Amy Adams as well if you want to see how versatile she is, see this film and then go home and watch her performance in Disney's Enchanted she definitely is one I'm going to keep my eye on as she keeps upping her game. The movie is very good and written not far from the truth.",7,1,1,7 January 2011
Up in the Air," Finally a Clooney film that didn't bore me to death
","Well well wonders never cease!! Clooney finally made a movie I wasn't bored out of my tree watching, nice change of pace for a change! Good casting as everyone delivers an awesome performance especially Clooney much to my surprise. I am not a fan of his if you haven't noticed. He plays Ryan Bingham a man whose job it is to deliver the news to the big corporate companies employees that have been let go saving the their actual bosses from having to do it (so true to life the chicken sh**s) Ryan enjoys his life on the road nobody to report too family wise, it works out quite nicely for him. Then Anna Kendrick's character Natalie Keener gets hired by his firm and she introduces the idea of web cam conference calls to the employees to cut air and travel expenses which in turn puts Ryan's job at risk. He then suggests to his superior (Jason Bateman) that she come along and see for herself how face to face is more necessary and they both learn life lessons from each other along the way. All I can say is this good job accepting this script Clooney cause its a winner. Hopefully you will work with director Jason Reitman again. Then i definitely will watch your films.",5,0,0,30 October 2010
