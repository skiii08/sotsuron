Casablanca," First-timer
","Seeing this movie for the first time in the 21st century, I asked myself, 'Well...was it as great as expected?'. I'd have to go with a yeah, sure! The movie was interesting. Was it the best movie I ever saw in my life? Uhh, not really. The main thing is that is kept me captivated (almost forgot I was watching it) and I was able to relate to parts of the film. When a movie is able to do that, create a relatable feeling for its audiences, then it's a winner. Casablanca was a real love story. Not this fluff that we see now a days that have the same concept and the same story line. I loved this films mise-en-scene. The props and effects used made the setting seem so real. There was great use of invisibility. Even though the scenes were not shot overseas, it kind of made you forget where they really were shooting.",9,2,3,13 March 2013
Chinatown," Which Chinatown Are YOU Talking About?
","getting ready to watch this movie, I was excited to see how this could go about. I wasn't sure if I'd like the film too much or maybe not at all. I was completely awed. The movie is the extreme mystery. The fact that it ends up as a twist is very powerful. The beautiful scenery of the water was a great way to get a better understanding of Los Angeles. I have seen movies like this, but then again I haven't. So was this a reference movie? It could possibly be one, I am sure. Needless to say, the camera work and the shots of the film were great. I loved the whole storyline of the film. It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.",Null,0,1,11 May 2013
Citizen Kane," Captivating
","This film is art! The combination of photography, metaphors, dialog, acting, and art bring together a great film. The movie emphasized power a lot. Power was emphasized when he trashed the room. And also the scene of the fireplace in his big mansion. The power that he had in the city, state, and the world was emphasized in that scene. The fact that he died saying the one word that meant so much to him, but meant nothing to the people around him (or who once thought they knew him) struck a sense of empowerment. The camera-work that was done in this film was very impressive. The dark shadows on the reporter, to have the audience know that even though the reporter was one of the main characters, he wasn't as important as Mr. Kane. That went for all the characters in that film. The production really emphasized the power that each character held. It was not meant to get mixed up nor confused.",9,1,3,11 May 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," Okay
","Surprisingly, I enjoyed this film. Not only was the plot intriguing but the characters were believable. The film gave a very realistic point of view on the issues that came along with the depression. Not many viewers, nor myself can relate to this issue or even feel what they might have felt. The movie created a portrait for us to see as it goes through the trails this family has to battle. The costumes in this movie not only helped gave us a visual on what the 30's were like; it allowed us to forget about the reality we currently are in. Again, this is the genius of film making. All of these things play an important role in the tone for the movie. I believe the props and the setting played the most important part in this film.",8,0,1,11 May 2013
The Graduate," Hysterical
","I loved this movie. It was the perfect blend of comedy, drama,love and action. The overall plot was very intriguing. I feel like everyone has been in the main characters shoes before( not knowing exactly what you want to do with your life). The theme was very relate-able. I feel as though everyone had a specific character that they could some how relate to. The music in this film was something that stood out to me. It was a bit more modern. I adored the fact that they not only made this movie a drama. But they also fit a lot of comedy into the film. I feel as though Dustin Hoffman played the role of a personality actor. I felt like I've seen the same persona played in other films he has starred in as well.",9,0,0,10 May 2013
Singin' in the Rain," A Pleasant Surprise
","I am not a big fan of musicals, however this film had me captivated in so many ways. It isn't even fair! The plot was very relate-able and sweet. Who doesn't like a film about love. I enjoyed the photography. I enjoyed the colors. I enjoyed the costumes. I loved everything! The roles played by the actors were well thought out. It seemed as if they fit the characters perfectly. The antagonist really had a major impact on the film. There was a point in time where the audience felt like she was actually going to get her way. The overall plot of the movie kept people on the edge of their seat. You found yourself feeling like you were fighting for justice right along with the good guys. The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners. The technicolor that was used in this film was not as harsh on the eyes as some others.It actually suited the film quite well. It gave more pleasure to the eyes.",9,0,2,10 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," Classic!
",This movie has so much substance to it( literally)! The music in this film is amazing. There is definitely a modern feel to it. The fact that the film reaches out to so many different types of people is astounding. Being able to relate to a film is one of the very most important ingredients when it comes to film making. I loved the rawness of the directing and producing. This film did a great job at capturing the lifestyle and works of this time period. The costumes took the film to the next level. The actors portrayed their characters amazingly. Uma Therman is at her best in this film.I love how dance is incorporated in the film slightly. This made the film seem more realistic and relate-able to its audience. The scene where Therman and Travolta are dancing is an unforgettable scene for many.,9,1,3,11 May 2013
Psycho," Wow
","Okay, so I am obsessed with horror films. Even though this film is quite old and the effects are a bit dated. I would definitely have to say that this horror flick is way better than some out in theaters today! The music went well with the scenes. There were a great deal of lighting and contrasting used to create a sort of eerie feel. The plot was outrageous but not too far fetch. What made this film so great is that it is believable. All the incidents that happen in the film are things are not fantasy. The actors played their characters very well. Their words, feelings and emotions they portrayed felt authentic. The editing allowed for discontinuity during murder scenes, where certain images were a bit choppy. Overall , I give this film an A.",9,0,0,11 May 2013
