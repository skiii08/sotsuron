Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," a waste of time and money
","George Lucas DEPENDS ON computer graphics and the Star Wars reputation to sell tickets for this one. He made a movie in a computer, and filled in the holes with actors. Two Jedi knights set out on a mission to save a queen and her kingdom from a greedy empire.
		Money and graphics a good movie make does not. Poor Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson, two of the most passionate and talented actors in movies today, and they were never given a chance to mesmerize the audience which they do so well. It appeared they were just following bad directing, and reading their lines off of cards. I know they're much better than this.	This movie has no personality whatsoever. The characters lack personality, the script lacks personality; everything is boring. The directing is bad, and the writing is worse. As I watched the credits roll by at the end of the flick, I thought 'look how many people it takes to make a cr-p movie(insert 'a').		I wasted $18 U.S. per ticket(regular price) for this one in Japan, don't you waste your money. It's going take some real convincing to get me to cough up cash for the next episode.
	I give it a 3 for the graphic effects only, which we already know are the best anywhere, but so what. 			George good businessman is, good writer/director not is.",Null,0,1,13 August 1999
Mulan," Typical Disney......but Entertaining
","Mulan is very entertaining. The only daughter of an old, disabled father goes to war in his place to fight the Mongols who have breached the Great Wall! 			 			This is a typical Disney movie; the same characters set in a different time and place. but it is still worth watching if you don't mind that. Mushu(Eddie Murphy), Mulan's comical sidekick, is very funny. Eddie does a great voice, and Mushu's jokes are funny! I watched it twice just for the comical entertainment, and little for the feeling of adventure too. 			 				I recommend it. I gave it a 9.",9,1,1,7 August 1999
When Harry Met Sally...," toooo muuuch whinnning.
","I see all the favorable reviews of this one, and when I first saw this in '89, I thought 'great'. And it is a leader in the romantic comedy genre. Billy Crystal has a way of pulling off these kinds of roles. He's good, great timing, funny almost anywhere. Meg Ryan plays a good part also; she is good in most of her comedy roles. Her serious roles leave little to be desired. Rob Reiner's direction is good but predictable. We see New York through a stereotypical camera. He makes us think everyone in NYC is Italian when they're young, and when they get old, they become Jewish. I suppose this is humorous to the populace.Well, I watched it again recently, and I have a question: Am I the only one who thinks these characters whine too much? Don't they have any better things to do with their energy than lament over the slightest trouble they confront? Yes, this is 'Seinfeld before Seinfeld', and Seinfeld is funny, but I can't watch it for too long before feeling exhausted.The movie is about couples and their love troubles. Billy Crystal is charming, woman love this, it's his unintimidating, 'I'm fallible' humor. Meg Ryan is made out to be a smart career woman who is stupid(big career woman can't drag a Christmas tree).Characters suffering from a neurosis for our entertainment is funny, but it's not romantic. Woody Allen invented neurotic, romantic comedies in the movies. That's enough.If you love the TV comedy 'Seinfeld', you'll love this one. If you get tired of 'Seinfeld', you know what to expect. It's entertaining but.............It gets a 6.",6,3,4,27 June 1999
Goodfellas," Great Mafia Flick
","This is possibly the best Mafia movie you could ever see. Ray Liotta, in one of his best roles, narrates throughout the movie, and it works wonderfully. This movie tries to show the true feeling of being a gangster; you never know who your friends are, and never trust anyone. De Niro is good, Pesci is good, and the direction by Scorcese is good. This movie is hard, cold and cruel. It's highly recommended.",9,0,0,2 August 1999
