The Rock," Ahh... action, adventure, humor, and just a little sentimentality
","I'm getting sick of all this needless complaining about how 'The Rock' is just another action movie.  I'm sorry, [] one and all, but I must step outside my usual neutral stance to one of sheer defiance--'The Rock' is anything but another action movie.  For starters, it gained TONS of critical praise, not only for the edge-of-your-seat action sequences, but also for its unique slant on the characters-- from Nicholas Cage's believable turn as a computer geek to Sean Connery's hard-edged view of life (I did love that 'f--k the prom queen' line, by the way) to Ed Harris' amazing performance as the tortured villain, General Hummell.  If you want to complain about a generic action movie, go see something like one of the Rambo sequels, or maybe some undeniable crap like Iron Eagle.",8,1,1,20 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More magic from Lucas
","I was one of those people who flopped into theaters with one ominous thought on my mind: Star Wars- Episode 1 might suck.  REALLY BAD.  But it didn't. And legions of Trekkies have just ran back into their closets to cower in fear as the juggernaut called LucasArts plows through the market once more. What I saw in Lucas' new wunderkind was something I hadn't seen in movies in ages- a wholesome, safe-for-all-ages (except for that one scene, no spoilers now!) yarn that still kept you on the edge of your seat with fantastic sequences like the Podrace (can you say 'WipeOut?') and the final battle between Obi-Wan, Schindler (I meant Qui-Gon Jinn), and Darth Maul (I meant Satan).  While I did some obnoxious MSTing throughout (mostly 'Kill Jar-jar! Kill Jar-jar!') I was thoroughly pleased with this movie.  We have edge-of-your-seat dramatics (those always help), anime-influenced combat scenes (if you ever watch anything from Yukito Kishiro or Mamoru Oshii, you'll know what I mean), and a staggeringly cool new villain by the name of Darth Maul (I see your schwartz is as big as mine... but I have two!).  My suggestion, if you haven't seen Episode 1 yet, is to haul yourself and a half-dozen friends over to the theater and buy a matinee ticket!  Okay, that's a little extreme, but I still think you should see this movie, if Star Wars is your bag.  If it isn't, then -the following material has been censored by the IMDb due to graphic language and crude sexual content.-",9,7,9,8 July 1999
Blade," Probably the best vampire action movie made
","As a veteran of many comic books and their notoriously lame films, I was one of those who expected Blade to fall flat on its face with pitiful acting and little ice skates poppin' outta their boots.  Well, New Line Cinema has most certainly proved me wrong. With an awesome, pumping soundtrack, dramatic, compelling acting, and battles to rival the greatest works of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and John Woo put together, Blade was everything it was made out to be and more.  Of course, you have your mandatory vampire movie elements: a couple innocent bystanders getting bitten, gloomy, dark garb, a (somewhat) tortured hero, and, of course, LOTS and LOTS of gushing blood. We have Wesley Snipes as the half-vampire, half-human hero Blade, packing enough weapons to decimate an army of his monstrous foes and still have enough left to raid the local convenience store.  Stephen Dorff (god, what's up with that name?) is the incredibly slick villain Deacon Frost, who brings a new meaning to the word 'evil.'  Lastly, we spotlight Kris Kristofferson (okay, I complained about 'Dorff,' but this is ridiculous...), who is Blade's supplier of weaponry and a fellow vampire-hunter. If you're in the mood for a lot of action, a little comedy (that fat guy really looks like my Algebra teacher...), lots of thick red blood (okay, big turnoff... but it's all CGI!), and a lot of surprises, see 'Blade.'  It'll really make a cutting impression in you.  (God almighty, that was a lame finishing line...)",Null,0,1,24 June 1999
Face_Off," One of John Woo's finest works
","Notice I said 'ONE OF.'  Not THE finest.  No, Face/Off isn't John Woo's BEST movie (that's The Killer, and Face/Off isn't The Killer), but it is an undeniably good thrill ride. Leading the pack, we have John Travolta as FBI agent Sean Archer, who is completely obsessed with finding his arch-rival, the elusive criminal mastermind Castor Troy, so skillfully played by Nicholas Cage, then later (and MUCH better) by Travolta himself.  We have Dominique Swain (insert rallying wolf whistles here) as Archer's loooovely daughter, Gina Gershon as Castor Troy's girlfriend, and Travolta and Cage switching off roles as Archer and Troy, all via the joys of plastic surgery. The action reaches a fevered pitch as the two pick up guns and start blowing up everything in sight.  John Woo's trademark, dizzying, almost lyrical gunfights, punctuate each of the struggles between the determined good and the twisted evil. If you're looking for a lot of action, as well as a great story and the grace of John Woo's directing, take Face/Off for a spin.  Afterwards (if you're impressed... if you aren't, don't read any further), rent John Woo's other good movies (The Killer, Hard Boiled, and Broken Arrow) and see what you think of them!",8,0,1,8 July 1999
Mission: Impossible II," The same ol' great stuff from John Woo... but something's missing...
","Now, I'm not saying M:I2 was bad.  I'm not saying it was good, either.  I'm just saying that it was really friggin' cool to see Tom Cruise do a slow-motion cartwheel kick on Dougray Scott's ugly mug.  Now, if you wanna see action this summer, go see Gladiator.  If you wanna see special effects, go see Titan, A.E. or X-Men.  M:I2 runs the middle line--a fair amount of action, and decent-enough special effects... but this is friggin' Diet John Woo here.  Watch something of his WITHOUT all the kind, sugar-coated PG-13 censoring, and you get films that exude raw power from every sweat-soaked pore.  Believe me, 'The Killer' makes this movie look like 'Elmo in Grouchland.'  Not-half-bad state or no, grab a bunch of friends and see this movie, in a theater with a big screen and good sound.  If you're the action hound I am, you'll be satisfied... just not filled.",7,0,0,28 May 2000
Die Hard," If this movie doesn't recharge your batteries, then I don't think anything else will.
","'Yippie ki yay, motherf--ker!'  This is the line that Bruce Willis delivered in Die Hard, and this is the line that spawned all kinds of idiotic tag lines from dozens of other movies (Ah-nuld's infamous 'I'll be back' doesn't count 'cause it came first).  Well, lessee what we got here... Bruce Willis and his dinky little handgun as maverick cop John McClane and his dinky little handgun, Alan Rickman (in an insanely good performance) as vicious terrorist Hans Gruber, and a skyscraper-full of hostages and terrorists. Oh, don't forget the explosives.  There's so much explosives in this movie that it makes me want to jump for joy.  I truly get tired of movies like The Big Hit, which rely too much on a melding of Hong Kong-style gunfighting and basic fist-fights.  Die Hard slams into you with the speed of a freight train, with (realistic) gunfights, a truly brutal  (again, realistic) battle between Bruce Willis and Alexander Godunov, and an ending that leaves you dizzy, begging director John McTiernan for more.  Hey, at least there's two more sequels, and those are just as good (but nowhere near better) as this... the original!",10,0,1,19 July 1999
Die Hard with a Vengeance," He who fights and runs away, lives to die hard another day. This rocks!
","Nobody can deny that the first two Die Hard movies were among the best action films ever made.  But, like most trilogies (Star Wars and The Godfather are exceptions), the first is the best, the second is good, and the third (compared to the first two) is the worst.  While Die Hard with a Vengeance isn't a bad action movie, it just doesn't reach that level of greatness that the first two flicks had.  Samuel L. Jackson is particularly enjoyable as prejudiced shop owner Zeus Carver (What, you think I'm Puerto Rican?!  He said 'Hey, Zeus,' not Jesus!).  Die Hard with a Vengeance is a great thrill ride, and well worth the money of a rental.",9,0,0,20 July 1999
Con Air," Put the bunny back in the box--NOW.
","I must say, after flopping down in a rather comfy couch and inhaling two bags of Pizza Rolls, I have never enjoyed two hours of my life more than the day a bunch of relatives sat in my uncle's home theater and watched Con Air. Sure, no plot, but who cares?  It's an action movie!  Action movies don't have plot!  They have character development but NO STORY!  So alla you prudes quit whining about how action movies insult one's intelligence! They're not meant to be any slant of 'intelligent!'  They're mindless, simple fun where you watch stuff blow up.  Anyways... Con Air is a good, but not GREAT action flick that has Nicholas Cage (one of my favorite actors) as Forrest Gump on steroids.  Perfect insane guy John Malkovich plays perfect insane guy Cyrus 'the Virus' Grissom, the film's beautifully deranged villain.  If you want action and you're willing to shut your brain off for a while, go see Con Air.  If you're unwilling, go and watch an 'intelligent' action movie--if you can find one.",8,0,0,20 July 1999
The Matrix," By and far, THE action movie of '99!
","Let me be completely honest and open when I say that 'The Matrix' is a REALLY FRIKKIN' WEIRD movie.  I breezed into the theater expecting a run-of-the-mill action movie with lots and lots of things that go boom with a decent plot to move the story along, without much thought needed.  Whoo boy, was I wrong.  We have good ol' local boy Keanu Reeves as Neo, a hacker with some incredible power buried deep within him, and Laurence Fishburne as the enigmatic Morpheus, an equally powerful hacker who trains Neo in the use of his incredible abilities, ranging from jumping vast distances to nigh-unstoppable speed, strength, agility, and stamina, and the ever-cool ability to dodge bullets and occasionally stop them dead in their tracks. While I can't tell much more without spoiling the unbelievably cerebral plot, I can tell you that seeing 'The Matrix' will give you a completely new perspective on life.  Oh, and I did try and run up a wall in a paintball game after I saw this movie.  If it makes you feel any better, and especially if it gives you a good laugh, I fell flat on my ass.",9,0,0,7 October 1999
Gladiator," Behold! Braveheart with that cop from L.A. Confidential!
","If there's one thing that gets to me while I browse through movie reviews, it's pedantic, bitchy rants about 'historical inaccuracies.'  I'll be honest--SCREW HISTORY!  You don't go to the movies for a history lesson; you go because you want to scarf down popcorn while seeing two people kick the flying crap out of each other!  Intelligent movies are the ones you watch at home... with the exception of Gladiator.  Sure, some people can say that it's all action and not much else, but compared to the rest of the action epic crop, Gladiator pumps the most brain power out of all of them.  Name another action movie this year that makes you wanna go 'ick' at Commodus' incestuous advances towards his sister.  Name another action movie this year that almost brings your critical ass to tears when General Maximus comes across the ashen remains of his old life.  To end it all, name a Roman epic that tops Ben-Hur and Spartacus in spectacle, and you have Gladiator. Sure, Kirk Douglas would beat Russell Crowe into a body cast, but I'll go with Ridley Scott's prettier, CGI-powered Rome.  And it's by DreamWorks, which is always a good thing in my book.",8,0,0,28 May 2000
