The Sound of Music," the greatest musical of all time
","this is definitely the greatest musical of all time but that still makes it less fun to watch than mortal kombat:annihalation seven times in a row. I have never been much of a fan of musicals, but this film...... does nothing to change my opinion. If you like musicals watch, if not head for the hills, alive or not. As usual Julia Andrews' acting performance is flawless...definitley comparable to a similar role in her other blockbusting and cultural film...Mary Poppins.Seriously though, unless u are a massive fan of musicals (and i mean MASSIVE) avoid this film at all costs. Yes its well made but so is a korean supermini.",Null,0,5,26 January 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Be fair y'all
","I love this one, some 'critic' says the only redeeming features to Attack of the Clones are that it has an interesting storyline and that it has nice action and special effects. Erm, what more do you want? How many action films has anybody out there seen that actually have an original plotline and one that makes you think? I can think of a handful (mission: impossible, the matrix). Special effects are the backbone of any top action film and this one tops them all (apart from aforementioned matrix). Seriously, this film needs to be cut some slack. Episodes 4,5 and 6 came out decades ago, and really weren't all that much better. How is Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker any more convincing than Hayden Christensen (as Anakin) in this installment. Yes, he had energy, but he couldn't deliver a line to save his life. The only decent acting performance in the original movies was Harrison Ford. Ewan Mcregor is just as accomplished in his role as a subdued but ultimately caring jedi mentor. His frustration at Anakin's arrogance and the fact that he has to some how live up to his own mentor Qui Gon Jinn is portrayed brilliantly  - and oh so subtle. Awesome performance from him. Portman and Christensen were acting like pieces of wood, and Savage Garden definitely had a role in the script, but as I've pointed out, nobody in the originals really acted all that well either, how can anybody be expected to act well here? The visuals were great though. Yoda is king, although i agree that lightsabre scene does get old very fast. I still want to be a jedi knight after watching this film. And i think that is the measure of both this episode and the Phantom Menace. Neither, apparently, live up to their legendary forebears because those are held in some nostalgic aura that really doesn't recognise the fact that they weren't THAT good as films on their own. To try and rate them as such is an exercise in futility. Star Wars is all about the feel. Watching the originals you just wanted to be able to pick up a lightsabre and kick some butt. These films do nothing to dent that, in fact they come in even higher because of the special effects everyone wants to talk about. Come on people give Lucas a break.....bring on Episode 3!",Null,0,1,11 September 2003
Event Horizon," Best space-horror EVER!!!
","I only managed to watch this film on VHS but contrary to what other people have said i didn't really see that this detracted from the film.
The big word for Event Horizon is claustrophobic. Right from the beginning when Sam Neill finds himself trapped in the bacta chamber to the horribly cramped and torture chamber style scenes on board the ship, everything is enclosed and it is this that makes this one of the scariest films ever. The whole idea of the crew trying to escape but not being able to is extremely disturbing and alongside the brilliant characterisations within the film help to create a very eerie mood.",9,0,1,7 November 2000
Gangs of New York," Scorsese does it again
","Daniel Day Lewis comes off an early retirement to do this film. Woah, was it worth it. Remember that tall clean shaven guy with a hint of native indian in his voice from the Last of the Mohicans....abracadabra, he's gone and is replaced by Billy the Butcher, a painstakingly slow talking, moustachioed, fake eyeball wearing, Bronx speaking native of New York. What a transformation! If you thought he was good in Mohicans just wait til you see him hear. Awesome. In each of Scorsese's recent gangster films, we see one character far more evil than anybody else near the screen. In both Goodfellas and Casino this part was played by Joe Pesci who is one of the most disturbing characters ever portrayed. Bill the Butcher comes close. That insanely deep blue-eyed stare and the twitchin' moustache are just plain scary.O yes, and there was a film attached to this character wasn't there. Gangs is a great work by Scorsese definitely up there with Casino, if not quite Goodfellas (a film anyone is going to be hard pressed to topple). The scene is 1860s New York and the five points. Here instead of his usual cast of Harvey Keitel, Robert deNiro, Joe Pesci et al. Scorsese decides to use a slightly different set of players. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the 'hero' and his leading lady, Cameron Diaz.Amazing camera shooting is a definite highlight. Best moment? when McGinn kicks open the doors at the beginning so Liam Neeson can march his gang out into the street. As in all of Scorsese's greatest films we see the whole plot unfold through the eyes of two characters. The Butcher and Amsterdam (the Priest's son). As in Goodfellas and Casino we are forced to follow and do exactly what the characters on the screen are doing and as a result we feel it when Bill savagely head butts Amsterdam in the face and cringe when he throws a knife into Monk McGinn's back. Woah, that Day Lewis again, what an actor!!!The only problem with this picture is the ending. The whole theatre was poised for the mother of all gangland battles and all we got was a half-hearted excuse for a tussle. Bill the Butcher the hardest, most solid guy in the Points really should have beaten the stuffing out of that little upstart Amsterdam but the trifling army just gets in the way of what would have been a epic battle. Obviously a symptom of the fact that Scorsese tried to incorporate the main story, and the story of New York's Civil War experience into one film. However, apart from this one glaring error the issues raised here are very well presented. Especiually the plight of the african-american trying to live in the city.Overall, top film. DiCaprio was good; Day Lewis was.....what can I say; and the ending was shoddy. Good one Marty",Null,0,0,16 January 2003
