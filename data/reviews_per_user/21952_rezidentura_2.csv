Skyfall," Too many wrinkles, plot-wise and otherwise
","Skyfail.Too many wrinkles on too many old faces, including Bond's. Bad make-up or some kind of statement? If they hoped it would lend it some authenticity, they may have been wrong.Good thing they killed off Dench's M. Not a moment too soon.Fiennes' trousers impressed... bespoke tailoring... especially at the seat.Silva (what's his name) is the only redeemer as the bad guy, the only star is for him.Plot... next please.Shanghai looks like it's on another planet to London... maybe it is.Craig, a very small ass, no brawn, no brain, too thin, no fighting moves, fighting sequences pathetic... like some kind of badly choreographed dancing, easily the worst of any third-rate action film I've seen. And I seen plenty. Even the Irish Bond (what's his name again - the one before Craig) would beat Craig up.What else is to say? Ah yes the motorcycle race was not too bad for a very brief moment at the beginning. Maybe should of stopped there. But the landrover defender failed to impress, that ugly thing can't drive like that everybody knows it.The new Q is rather suspect too. Where did I see him? Where have all the Bond girls gone? At this rate, we'll be having Bond BOYS in the next one. I won't even mention the list of all the Nato agents. Upon wasting two hours of my time. I thought I would waste five more minutes and write a review.And this is it.And thank you for wasting your time by reading it.",1,5,11,30 March 2013
Argo," Argo *** yourself
","Rubbish movie. Saw it today and it was boring even though not that long. The only good thing about it was the bucket of salted popcorn that I ate and washed down with a pepsi whilst sitting through it.Everything about it was predictable, to my anyway, the outcome, the characters, most of it has been done before and much better. the actors' performances were below par, they could have done better, there was nothing reflective about it, no locale atmosphere but that's because it was not shot on location and is basically a cheap flick that couldn't afford enough time to be atmospheric. Of course it's heavy on a sometimes self-deprecating but still dumb and over-the-top American patriotism which the American audiences are sure to gobble up in huge doses which could explain its apparent success over there.There's not much action in it but the absence of guns blazing or faces smashed or asses kicked is no guarantee of a good movie either.There's little that's authentic about this film even though it's supposedly based on a true story. It just doesn't ring true. I think the decision to name it best movie was political.Well, to use a quote from the movie, and its biggest punch line at that: Argo f*** yourself!",2,18,32,3 March 2013
