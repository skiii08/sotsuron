Scarface," 'I neva f***** anybody over in my life that didn't have it coming to them'-Simply The most raw and influential character played by Pacino..
","To start of, I don't understand why there's still people who hate this movie. What kind of world are you in, stating that its the worst movie ever made(common, then again your ignorance precedes you). This has to be the best of its genre of crimes, gangsters and violence. Ever since a lot of people kept rambling about this even 20 years after it's released, I've been dying to see what the fuss is about. comedians, rappers, actors always referring or quoting SCARFACE. After watching it i could understand why this movies so influential and so popular. Pacino displayed a distinct kind of acting that really made a mark on me. He was and became Tony Montana. No one else could have filled this arrogant, angry, ambitious, fearless and fierce persona other than Pacino. The portrayal of the character is so believable, intense and raw. As a viewer and admirer, you will cheer and follow his every move to become a vicious gangster and drug-lord. This is Pacino at his best and a role of a lifetime. Truly an amazing take into the character of Montana, he really gave it an icon for all those who love this genre. Much respect for Pacino in this masterpiece.The violence, rawness, intensity, an insight to the mind of an ambitious criminal. The direction, action, drama, depiction of Scarface is unmatched. A story, a film that you have to see once in a lifetime. The rise and fall of Tony Monatana, a wonderful masterpiece. 10/10 - Don't listen to critics, enjoy this to its full potential.",10,0,1,3 June 2007
Deja Vu," Terrific, thrilling, engaging .....
","This film really surprised me. I got a lot more than I expected which was to see a stereotypical action, sci-fi, thriller. But it wasn't at all, it's engaging from start to finish, as you follow every move of the protagonist you succumb to his struggle, his weakness, his hope. This definitely impressed me, with it's clever take on scientific experimentations on changing a future. The way they project the notion is quite over the top but sure is acceptable for the way technologies going on right now. rarely do I actually enjoy a movie for what it is and it's contents, but this one really made an impact.Denzel plays his role as refined as always, as does the rest of the cast, except maybe that I had a little problem accepting caviezels performance. It's probably because his characters undeveloped and all I new about him was that he got rejected by the government as part of the service. Which brings to the conclusion that he really is messed up in the head, why bomb just for an unjustified reason, yes once again his character is crazy. Still I wasn't convinced on his portrayal(it wasn't intense enough). Coming back to the film, it's brilliant explosions, use of effects, camera techniques, that car chase, and unique story telling is definitely worth anyones time. Highly recommended.",10,1,3,26 May 2007
Training Day," Impressive, immense impact from Washington...
","I stumbled across this amazing film not expecting anything special. But I was completely blown away by the content and theme of this. Only being revolved around two guys, Washington and Hawke. Washington being the so called mentor for the newbie Hawke. Though as a rookie would expect everything to be by the book and to only follow orders he is completely confused and unaware of what Washingtons true methods are. Methods of violence and brutality against criminals unorthodoxed. To be smarter and more cunning than any criminal they fight against is whats become of Washington.Their 24 hour ordeal is action packed thriller with an amazing performance by Washington and truly worthy of an Oscar. His portrayal of a cop gone completely insane with his credibility of being a 'someone' important and big is truly impressive. There's a unique sense of portrayal of the character from Washington. The scene with the Mexican gangsters is thrilling at the same time this movie gave a feel of realism in connection to the present world.Denzel stepping out of his usual goodie good role at the same time playing it with intensity and command. An amazing movie with amazing performances, you wouldn't think much of it just by the title, but try it and it may end up blowing you away. And yes there's that scene with eva mendez!! Now you'll want to watch it more. No? But really this movies worth your time so go see it if you haven't.",10,0,2,24 May 2007
Superbad," Super cool,Super hilarious,Super awesome,SuperBad indeed.!!!!
","By far the most unexpected movie for me in such a long time. I'm glad I saw this by far the funniest all year. The characters work, they seem real enough, raw, charismatic for both the two lead cast. They did great playing their roles specially through those laugh out loud situations. The plot? damn the plot when there's mclovin and two Mofo's trying to get booze and getting laid by the last girls that would with them.This is one of the best movie's this year a very different outlook on comedy, accurately done to project the stupidic purpose. But hey its all about the laughter and you cant miss this one. Extremely recommended. Even the portrayal of two bestfriends loving each other is awkward as it is hilarious to watch. 10/10 jonah did pull through here.",10,5,8,9 December 2007
Spider-Man 3," Still amazing...in a different way...
","OK so i've heard and read about all these comments and yeah there are pointers which stick out.To be honest I personally enjoyed marvelling at the astounding effects of this one as it should. Critics say the story wasn't at the expectancy level, that the story would evolve more steadily, with perfect pacing, focus at the same time true to the spiderman escence.People complain about too many villains and different focuses on meaningless characters(gwen). But as a fan first rather than a critic, i still enjoyed it. It was fun and entertaining. Common its spiderman, though a carefully, thought out story would have given this one even more praise, at the end of the day its pure entertainment, for every fan to enjoy. Although i didn't think tobey was exceptional as the black spidey!! Still recommended to all!",10,3,4,12 May 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Kickstarted a new way of storytelling with intense action and beautiful cinematography..
","First of all I'm not a very big on films like these, except jet li's and maybe iron monkey. I know the whole idea of flying around and jumping of walls inhumanly as possible is quite hard to take if your not familiar with the kind of genre. But it does'not really matter because the content itself is just amazingly beautifully projected and executed. And yes it has changed my view on films like these, for starters it blew me away. The unreal aspects is taken over by the immense acting talents, the swordplay, the story. Truly deserving of any awards it has received and it really has attracted more world recognition of martial arts, action, drama, wire works intertwined into a one of a kind movie.It's certainly one of the movies where it creates such an impact just like, star wars or the matrix did on me. This is that kind of movie to me(the eastern version). Overall anyone should be able to see it once in their lifetime to appreciate an amazing gem that is Crouching tiger/hidden dragon.",10,1,2,24 May 2007
I Am Legend," Excellent performance from smith,intense, raw and a unique insight.
","I had high expectations for this movie since there's quite the hype, plus Smith's in it. Its not as gory, or like such films as 28 weeks later nor any other in its genre. But the interest and rawness is from the observatory and moving portrayal of Smith. It feels through out the movie the feeling of reality gone horribly wrong and how such impossibility is dealt with and dealt with very well, through a well acted character. You feel for him, you follow and anticipate what he does and observe closely as your hooked from the start.His reactions and ways to keep himself sane is reminiscent of cast away. Though in this his relationship with the dog is inspirational as it is sad. Its a moving movie an imaginative one. Great performance from Smith. It is intense through out keeping you at the edge of your seat. The downsides are the infected monsters appearance while it is alright, it wasn't as scary as i anticipated. Through seeing transformers and 300 the level of cgi really went up and I felt as if it could have been more lifelike. It could have been longer too, a hour more would have made it even more perfect. But overall very interesting movie and you won't be disappointed, just remember to keep an open mind and appreciate the acting not just the gore or horror.",10,2,3,25 December 2007
Transformers," Visually stunning, funny and the epitome of coolness....
","Wow, this movie just blew me away. I didn't have very high expectations but this just amazingly projected a stylistic vision of what is Transformers.Not an avid fan but I did see some of the cartoons growing up. It was cool cars and what not transforming, good versus evil, Optimus vs Megatron, it was all gravy. But never have I imagined such stunning visuals and an individualistic adaptation so intense, just purely entertaining as it is impressive.From a viewers opinion, I wouldn't really convey the fact of some slight changes to the originals rather accept the fact that this is one of the few movies that amazes me in terms of visuals, plot and pace. Of course there's Megan Fox, who adds even more spice to the film.The only worry before watching this was the length and I'm relieved that it was just long enough to fit in all the necessary components to make it one hell of a movie. Michael Bay yet again stays true to his usual style of blowing up everything in sight but, no protest there its fun to watch. 10/10 watch it. No disappointments, except for the die hard fans who complain about the drastic changes.",10,1,4,21 July 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Amazing visuals, solid acting, thrilling plot and mind blowing wizard action...a movie fan review...
","First of all I'm one of the few who haven't read the books yet, rather an avid fan of the movies. From the very first HP I've been hooked to following an inspiring, adventurous and magical journey of these magical characters.The 5th installment doesn't disappoint overall. The plot, cgi's, actors, action, the dark theme and amazing visuals and presentation overall was just as impressive as it's predecessors. Though as a movie fan I had very high expectations specially after the goblet of fire. It was just as impressive yet something was missing. The other 4 left me satisfied, almost like a metaphor for a full circled movie. There were no holes everything was explained at the same time provided immense entertainment.This one left a little hole, maybe I expected more explanation of all the characters actions, or maybe I wanted to see more wizardry namely more wizard action. Or maybe more development of cho's and Harry's relation. But ultimately the fight sequences were just flawless.Different director, different projection. A minor flaw, because what really matters is the magic was still there, it was intense and most of all entertaining. Another masterful installment of the brilliant novel. 9/10 - Lets hope this is Yates last endeavor.",10,0,1,28 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," ALAS the last episode that goes out with a bang...
","The best of the three prequels with amazing projection same as the originals. This has a different feel, the star wars feel. Certainly satisfying most fans urge for a last star wars masterpiece. The cgi's were truly breathtaking and so as the fights scenes. Concentration on the main characters and sticking to the original plot without any sideplots or minor characters ruining the show,made it even more interesting.Palpatine, Anakin, obi wan, dooku, yoda and lots of jedi's steals the show for me pretty much. Till this day the imagination of jedi's is still one of the best from the star wars franchise. The saber fights, exhilarating, fascinating and raw as it comes. For someone who saw the first star wars movie back in 95 at age 7, though it was late I became a fan. I love the star wars movies but other than that nothing more. But it still doesn't take away the fact that these franchise left a solid mark on the industry and the world.A rare story and fantasy world brought to life in such a masterful and original way. I assume any fan or someone who just wants to watch the last of the saga won't be disappointed. Rarely do i find myself lost into another world because of the brilliance of how a movie is projected and made, besides the lord of the rings trilogy.The last of the collection, make sure you have it. 10/10",10,0,4,8 July 2007
The Matrix," The modern film that intensely impacted on raising the bar even higher...
","im_veritas_photo = a critical, lonely, ignorant, needs to chill out person. Who would watch matrix again you say? Well too bad cause millions of people have and I'm one of them. You wonder why your not impressed, because of how your mind works thats why. I'm sorry for not accepting your stupid comment but, your putting down a modern classic of film history. When matrix graced the screens it has impacted highly throughout the world more than most films. Not everyone can be as critical as you, stating every flaws you can see.Ask yourself, why do people watch films? Well if you have no slightest clue then here it is, simple, so your closed mind can understand. BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED AND WANT OUR MINDS TO BE OCCUPIED IN ORDER TO GET AWAY FROM OUR REALITY. Truly matrix has done so in more ways opening up an interesting concept of the future ahead, it's projection of reality within reality is interesting.The whole message really is simple, our present world has been taken over with technology to ease our lives. Only in the matrix they vent to the possibility that with what is going on now it can create superior advancements of machines if were not careful. Reeves and the rest gave a great performance for their roles as well as being convincing with the fight scenes. And who can forget bullet time!! If you can't appreciate this film for it's amazing take on the sci-fi, kung fu, action and romance, then clearly it isn't for you. So do all the fans out there a favor and not put out hateful comments(without acceptable reasoning), because naturally all those who appreciate this will disagree and waste their time too defending this film, like me.",10,0,1,25 May 2007
Heat," Unforgettable shoot out scene.plus Al and De Niro's there period.
","This film is just captivating and raw. I love the captured realness of the action particularly the scenes with guns. This film is long but, worth anyones time. Brilliant filmaking and for those who hated it, have no knowledge of what a great film is. OK so the story is not as strong, but character wise, my favorite actors did well convincingly.The shoot out scene is worth the time alone seeing the whole movie. Its definitely one of the best captured. It gave me goosebumps how real it felt watching the bank robbery. Overall just an amazing film that shouldn't be missed by anyone who proclaims themselves as movie buff's.If you liked the action here of course you can't miss, The kingdom, Four brothers, SCARFACE and Dragon heat. 10/10 Pacino and Deniro for the 2ndth time.Watch out for Righteous kill.",10,0,1,22 December 2007
