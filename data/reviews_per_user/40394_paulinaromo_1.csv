The Lobster," Should have walked out sooner
","I think this is my first review on IMDb, I've posted reviews on other sites and I normally give a synopsis for a review, but not this time. I won't even bother going into details, but I thought this movie was trying too hard to be 'sublime' and it's just awful. A shame to put a brilliant cast through this disturbing and ridiculous plot/theme/nightmare of a movie. Only the fourth movie I've ever walked out of in my life and I only wish I'd walked out sooner than what I did. Started out interesting, albeit strange, but became too long, boring and as soon as I realized I didn't give two ___ about how it ended, we left. The only thing worse than having seen it is knowing I can't unsee it.",1,36,59,28 May 2016
