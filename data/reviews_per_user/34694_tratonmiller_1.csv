Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Brillliant
","I enjoyed this movie. I found it to be unpredictable, always being on the edge of your chair. It had a great deal of action, and hand to hand combat compared to the previous film. The plot of the film was very complex. The best word to describe the movies' plot is 'clever'. This is the only fault I find due to the lack of knowledge a viewer may have if he/she hasn't viewed the previous film. This movie was also filled with a great deal of humor; which I also found to be 'clever humor'. The performance of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law was impeccable, realistic, and both had great chemistry when portraying their roles as such close friends. Noomi Rapace, who portrayed a Gypsy woman, had an great performance as well. The sinister professor and villain in this movie is portrayed by Jared Harris, who in my opinion, made his character very believable and one of the greatest acts in the entire film. What I liked most is the element of surprise this movie carried, constantly making theories of the end but being astonished by the real final outcome. The ending of the movie was the perfect icing on the cake. I left the theater thinking to myself 'absolutely brilliant'. All in all, this movie was one of the greatest mystery films I have ever seen. There was never a dual moment and it kept the wheels of my mind constantly turning.",8,1,6,20 December 2011
