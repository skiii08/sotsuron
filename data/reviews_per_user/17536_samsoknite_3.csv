The Equalizer," One of the best action films in a while
","When I first sat down to watch this film I came in with little expectations. I hadn't seen the TV series it was based off and I hadn't read up at all on the plot. I saw the trailer, it looked interesting, and when I left I had felt a certain pleasure that I rarely feel when watching a film. The Equalizer is easily a contender for being one of the best action films in a long while. Safe to say that Denzel Washington nailed the role as the lead character and the supporting roles - especially the antagonist - were equally well done. What we have here is an action film with the right stars, a solid plot, and superb cinematography to match. Perhaps a particular favourite was the creativity in action scenes. It felt real, I didn't stop for a moment to think 'No way could that happen.' I felt the same for the characters, not a single one was out of place. Particularly the main character whom you never really know much about -- his past remains a mystery. It might seem Cliché from that perspective and I know some are going to be shocked - as I was - at the plot's progression. It was simply well done; it made sense, it paced fantastically, and it ended fine. When it comes to an action film starring Denzel Washington I don't think you can get it better than that. As far as criticism goes. There is a specific character - who I will not spoil - that acts as the primary catalyst for the film's events. I personally felt the resolution was redundant and that the character existed solely as a plot device. Her acting was great, however.",8,1,8,30 September 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Best Marvel Film (yet) and one of the best films I've ever seen!
","I had good expectations walking into the theater and knew that this film would be good. After all it received a lot of attention but none of the praise I've heard so far met it halfway. This film was simply amazing. Action, comedy, and even a little bit of drama -- this film had it all the way through and kept it coming. The acting just as the directing was stupendous to say the least. Compared to other series in the Marvel Universe this was one of those that didn't seem to be lacking. The drama felt real and not scripted, the comedy was very reactive and didn't feel planned, and the action was done well but not too much. Guardians of the Galaxy was just a film that got it right. For many superhero films they happen to have all the ingredients but never in the right proportions; which for this film wasn't the case. Many praises to Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and Dave Bautista for their roles. The rest of the case did an excellent job as well; I must say that Ronan was perhaps my favourite villain yet--next to Loki--Lee Pace had the role spot on and definitely gave me the feel of being perfect for those shoes. James Gunn's directing wasn't any less praise-worthy and really knew how to set up each scene to form subtle references to spot-on jokes. Above all this was a good film and no scene felt hindered in any way. For those who haven't seen this I say you should -- this is a must-see on the big screens.",10,1,5,12 August 2014
Elysium," Good action. Bad plot.
","Matt Damon did a fine performance as always but I felt the direction and writing of the film fell short and even then it was constantly masked by scene-after-scene of action which made it somewhat confusing to follow the importance of what was going on. Dues Ex? Check. Over-the-top bad guy? Check. Outrageously violent action scenes? check. So the film hits the list on action cliché's but what made it lose a lot of potential in my book was the fact I felt like I was watching an action flick where the director constantly wanted me to notice that only bad guys have money, drive Bugatti's--in this case fly--and always are found in the corporate scene. What happened to better ulterior motive than a coup d'etat? Seriously. This lacked the imagination I thought it would bring. Regardless of my complaints, the film did at least provide entertainment value for a Friday night.",5,2,3,11 August 2014
