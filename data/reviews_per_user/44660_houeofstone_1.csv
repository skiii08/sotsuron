The New World," Well it is better than no movie at all
","For those who have not scene the film the spoilers are in paragraph two.First, the scenery and cinematography are breathtaking. Unfortunately in order to show us the blowing grass and James river scenery the director has completely ditched the facts of the story in the interest of artistic impression. Obviously there are gray areas in 400 year old history, but here we have glaring omission and blatant fabrication.We do know that John Smith left the colony because he injured himself hunting. Not portrayed. The relationship between Pocahantas and Smith is overdone (she was only 11 when they met). And why does Smith not talk in the movie and why does Pocahantas continually wave her hands around like a mime. There are many other historical issues but you get the picture.Again the scenery is nice and I found the native Americans to be well done.",3,1,3,18 May 2006
