Marie Antoinette," Waste of time and space
","If you think this movie will offer you something more than your standard side page blurb in a high school history text you are wrong. If you are wanting to see things from 'just her side' of things- the movie does it- no explanation of anything, nothing gets deep.Its all very pretty though, its one of those 'art for arts sake' movies- avoid less you like them, the previews imo are misleading to the audience and attempting to draw in people that will not find this movie worth their time- please save your money.The acting is out of place, fitting with its music- both have seemingly random inserts of modern music and modern place acting- yes this all can be excused in the 'its art' line and vein of thinking- but then again I can bullshit everything and say its my artistic creativeness in seeing everything how my humors flow, but really its all an excuse to cover up this crap.",1,3,7,30 October 2006
