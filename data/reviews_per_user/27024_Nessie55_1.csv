The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The movie was very good and worth my time and money. (the previews were a pain)
","I loved this movie. The acting was wonderful and the story was great but then again I haven't read the books in about 3 years. I think that for the movie series it was really good. I would go back to the movies and see it again. If you go and see it and your on team Peeta (unlike me team gale) I would suggest taking a box of tissues with you. The song hanging tree is now one of my favorites and it's still stuck in my head even though I saw the movie the second day it came out.I wish that they hadn't split the book into 2 parts, although i'm glad they did. Without them splitting it into 2 parts it might not have been as good. They really should have added the lizard type things from the book. I really want to see what happens with the second part and am very excited. I think the actors did a pretty good job once again. 10/10.",10,6,28,4 December 2014
