Antz," Z's dead - No way!
","Z is a worker ant in a big ant colony. Z is also the working class hero in this drama about war, peace, treachery and love. This movie impressed me a lot. When the film starts, we see the inside of Ant Metropolis, the inspiration from Lang's 'Metropolis' is obvious. Thousands of ants show us a typical ant hive with a strict class structure and little individual freedom. This colony with its 'Mega' construction projects is much more believable than the bunch of ants shown in 'A bug's life'. The mood of 'Antz' is a dark one, as most of the story happens underground in the caves of the hive and death always possible. There are some light moments, and truly great ideas well animated, and these are all the more enjoyable. I can only recommend it and rate it 2 IMDB points above 'A bug's life'.",8,0,0,17 January 2003
A Bug's Life," Cute Bugs
","I agree this is a nice, funny, enjoyable movie. It has a lot of good ideas, beautifully rendered scenery and cuddly characters. However, it lacks the depth of the competition, 'Antz' which I watched right before 'A Bug's Life'. Do you know 'Maya the Bee'? This movie is a bit like this TV series, about all sorts of insects living together and having fun. The story is OK, bug not great - Ants are bullied by a gang of grasshoppers, but with enough courage they can fight them off by their sheer numbers. A bunch of circus bugs is needed to make the ants realize this. No one really gets scared by the movie, the well animated bugs look all cute, including the 'bad guys'. The movie is in the best tradition of Disney movies, good quality but very predictable. Pixar did a great job nevertheless.",6,0,1,17 January 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Incredibly intense prison movie
","What is so special about this movie? Thats what I asked myself when I saw it as one of the few IMDB top-rated movies I didn't know yet. Now I know why it deserves to be there. It is the best prison movie ever made. Most prison movies try to accuse the prison system by showing an increasing level of violence and spectacular escapes. Shawshank Redemption is somewhat different. The main actor is portrayed from the view of a second person and most of the time we see what this person sees. Shawshank prison is not a monastery, and while there are some violent scenes, most of the violence we only learn by the narrative of the second person. The time saved from depicting violence is spent showing the feelings of the inmates. Beyond the perfect technical work in producing this movie, the plot slowly builds up to incredible moments of courage and purity. I guess this is what essentially makes the movie so great, without being pathetic the movie makes us wonder about our own motives and decisions. Very thought provoking.",10,0,0,9 January 2003
