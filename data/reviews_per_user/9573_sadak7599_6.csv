Blade Runner 2049," Dumb and pretentious
","A wasted opportunity. One of the Most Overrated Films of the Decade. Another myth ruined by Ridley Scott. Another legendary character ruined by Harrison Ford (The ridiculous role and laughably dead of the aging Han Solo still hurts me).This movie evidenced that Ridley Scott and the writers didn't get what Blade Runner was about. The story is dumb, the characters are plain and irrelevant, the movie is plagued by inconsistent and unexplainable facts and decisions, and even cringe moments.Visuals are great, but not THAT great, and its pretentiousness decreases its merit. And the BSO is like a crappy exploitation of the original Blade Runner, as there are some crappy exploitations of Her and AI, both way superior movies in all aspects.A piece of crap carefully wrapped and selled. The sign of our times.",4,3,7,22 April 2019
Pacific Rim," Not as bad as it could be
","I think it is a challenge to make a good movie using the classic Japanese clash of giant monsters vs. giant robots. Just reading the story, you probably would think that this movie is utter garbage. And you would be right if Guillermo del Toro were not the director. Adding the right dose of humor, his imagination, good rhythm and action scenes, nice CGI, Idris Elba, and a pinch of del Toro universe (there are moments in which you are expecting Hellboy or some trolls will appear), the result is not that bad. The movie is not a great movie and will not be in the hall of fame of the cinematic art, but it is enjoyable and fun.",6,0,0,19 March 2018
Dunkirk," utterly overrated
","I think that all the 'micro vs macro' envision of the battle and other explanations on good reviews are bullshit. This is a bad movie full of trickery. The beautiful scenery, music, slow action that pretends to be deep and intimate (sometimes I remember the way better 'Thin Red Line', Terrence Malick, 1998) may fool a lot of viewers. But the reality is this: 1. No story at all. Simply some unlikable characters (except the old civilian captain) wandering around.2. Very bad setting. Modern buildings around the beach, a modern factory on the background and modern ships equipped with recent technology that they tried to disguise, failing miserably, do not help to get into the movie. 3. No epics. 4. No respect for the facts. A few soldiers making a line, a bunch of small boats and three planes gave a very poor envision of the dimensions of the real Dunkirk battle, in which hundreds of thousands of soldiers and thousands of pieces of equipment (trucks, guns, tanks...) packed out the beaches and the city, in which 40000 french soldiers died or were captured backing up the evacuation of the army fighting a real enemy, not an invisible menace that shot out a few bullets and a few bombs with one or two planes from time to time. 5. The French should be offended. 120000 French soldiers were evacuated also. In this movie, French are treated like garbage. 6. Risible air raids and combats, ended with a plane that violates the law of physics. This movie is not a tribute to the Dunkirk soldiers. It is offensive to the memory of that momentous event in the History.",4,10,16,2 August 2017
Alien vs. Predator," Not that bad. IMHO the third best Alien movie of the saga...
","... and for sure better than the expensive and pretentious garbage that Ridley Scott created as prequels. For what it is (a crossover between two previous sagas, mixed with classic techno-ancient-pyramid adventure, all the ingredients for a low quality Asylum-type sub-product) it is imaginative, well realized, with rhythm and good action. The only big problem I see with this movie is that everyone knows the modus operandi of the two legendary alien species, so no surprises here. We all know what will happen, how the guys will die and how the aliens will behave. But, if this movie were made in a parallel world without the classic Alien and Predator movie, it would be a revered classic. Maybe I am biased because I enjoyed that old AvP videogame and comic. But, you know, I really liked this movie. Simply do not take it too seriously. Some people complains about the dialogues and I cannot deny there are some idiotic decisions (nothing compared with the infamous Prometheus, though). Anyway, they are a bunch of people trying to escape from aliens, so, what do you expect? conversations about ancient Greek philosophy? Just enjoy the ride and badassness of the Predators.",6,2,2,23 October 2019
Zombieland," A surprise. Fun, original and enjoyable.
","A different take on the zombie theme. Really fun, with enjoyable characters, very well played. And possibly one of the best and wildest opening credits ever. I am eager to watch the sequel.",7,0,0,4 October 2019
Alien: Covenant," Did IQ's drop sharply while I was away?
","Save your money and time! this movie is a mess. I gave it a 2 because the visuals and FX are good (although quite standard, no evidences of the strong visual style of Ridley Scott, which made historic movies as Alien or Blade Runner)The movie is dumb, with a ridiculous and predictable plot, full of stupid and cringe situations, unlikable, weak and undeveloped characters, illogical decisions, the baddest Science Fiction ever, lack of suspense or thrill, and complete lack of coherence with other movies in the Alien universe, specially with the original and legendary Alien ( which is still the best movie of the saga, followed closely by Cameron's Aliens) When I was watching the movie, I remembered the quote of Ellen Ripley in Aliens: 'Did IQ's drop sharply while I was away?' because it seems that the IQ of the writers dropped sharply from 1986 to now.Please Mr. Scott, stop making movies. Maybe it is time to retirement, before you completely ruin your reputation. To the writers: I recommend to think more, watch previous movies, increase your science-fiction culture and study more before writing. During writing, please, use Wikipedia or something. Now some spoilers:<ul><li>The movie is bad from minute 1 to the end. The spaceship design is illogical and, aside of this, what to say about the 'neutrino burst' that damaged the ship. C'mon, seriously? is it so time consuming to check what the heck is a neutrino in google?. According to the writers, neutrinos are more or less like cal .050 bullets fired directly to the spaceship by hundreds of machine-guns. In a movie for fans of Aliens and Sci-Fi is highly probable that a LOT of people in the cinema knows what actually is a neutrino. This situation kick you off the movie. When the 'neutrinos' damaged the ship, there where A LOT of laughing in the theater. - This movie contains which probably is the most ridiculous character ever played by James Franco. Together with neutrinos, are unintended comedy. - What to say about the mad android trying to rape a girl or kissing to his twin brother. - The crew of the ship exhibit constantly a complete lack of human intelligence. I would need too much space and time to detail the cringe and illogical movements and actions of the crew. - The movie contains a blatant and SHAMELESS copy of situations taken from Cameron's Aliens, but much WORSE. Specially the fight against the alien which managed to reach the spaceship and is expelled to the space (sounds familiar?). So, add a complete lack of originality to this mess. - So, the mad android made genetic experiments in a cave, without laboratory and without any animal to experiment with. Also he draw a lot of medieval-like scrolls with drawings taken from Giger... SMART, WRITERS! - I could continue...but I spent enough time with this mess. Overall, this movie is a complete failure, a pathetic attempt to revive the past glory, which could be summarized in the use of specific visual elements used by Scott in the old good times (chains, industrial look of the spaceship...) and taking situations from the old good movies and using it after removing the emotion, intelligence and suspense. Covenant sadly converted Alien 4 and Prometheus in good movies.</li></ul>",2,23,44,21 May 2017
