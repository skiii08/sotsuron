Sucker Punch," please read and don't watch
","some good visuals, but besides that a dare i say it, story and the term used very loosely was just stretched way to far, then lots of visuals chucked in which have no relevance to the story what so ever.I suppose this could have been a good film, but it wasn't it seems to me that it was just padded, (no pun intended there)to give the film 1hour and whatever minutes instead of the 20 mins it deserves, And that would still be stretching it too long for me.On a up note though i suppose the acting wasn't to bad at all, and fair do's to the actors/actresses working with lack of storyCall me old fashioned, but i do like an intelligent story and this doesn't have one im afraid please do not waste your time.",1,6,13,17 June 2011
