Marie Antoinette," Historical???
","After seeing this movie i just have to log in and leave my comment. I am no movie critic and don't understand much about the fine points of movie making, i may not notice bad acting or lousy work of the director. One thing i know is history. It happens to be that historical movies is my favorite genre and this movie can not be called historical. No matter what they think in Hollywood wearing a costume and riding horses still doesn't make the the movie historical.Marie Antoinette is presented almost as some kind of a village girl that is amazed by the french royal court and the etiquette at the beginning of the movie.The rest of the movie seems to me like a modern teenage party in which all the participants r wearing 18th century clothes. No historical events, no historical accuracy!",1,19,34,16 February 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Movie for the children!!! And not the best one either
","Personally i think that only children at the ages of 5-12 can enjoy such a movie. Boring and predictable storyline, crappy acting (with no exeptions), horrible sense of humor (if these pathetic attempts to make people laugh can be called a sense of humor), pretty dumb and childish special effects and sci-fi tech. I would give this movie a firm grade of 1 out of 10, but since its meant for kids (at least i hope so), i guess it cold be a... 5 perhaps. (Eventually i decided not to rate it at all)Back when i was a kid, even some movies meant for children had great actors (like the first batman or batman returns), and weren't all about guys and girls with pretty faces and nice bodies but with no talent.Just for the record i did enjoy some movies based on comics, by which i mean the X men.",Null,1,3,15 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Much better than I expected. Really a great movie
","First of all I have to say that i watched the whole Batman movies and so far i really liked only the first 2 ('Batman' and 'Batman returns'). Just now i finished watching the 'Dark Knight', and i have to say that i am very impressed, I certainly expected much worse. One of the things that interested me the most, was to compare the Joker by Heath Ledger and the Joker by Jack Nicholson. These 2 'Jokers' are certainly different, but in my opinion both characters are created brilliantly by these two actors. Without righting any spoilers I'll just add that the plot isn't empty, simple or stupid like in many recent 'superhero movies'. Also, the movie isn't childish (in fact i don't think it's a good movie for children under 12-13 years of age). The Special effects are just great. Some people say that the movie is too long, but since i enjoyed it very much i don't agree with that. I really, really recommend it, 10/10.",10,4,9,29 July 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Yet another typical action movie
","I guess the best line to describe my feeling after watching this movie is, 'pretty much what I expected'. I expected a typical action movie, a sequel (which means there won't be anything new or original in it) and lots of action and effects with a little acting. I also expected some laughs, not because the movie will be funny, but because i was sure there will be some unrealistic and pretty dumb stuff (like in pretty much all the Hollywood action films). Just a couple examples (spoiler): The hero goes through explosions, gunfire, fights and car accidents and gets only few bruises by the end of the movie (how typical), while destroying, at least, a couple hundreds million dollars worth of property. The second thing that i found pretty funny is that some of the most important facilities of the US, that the terrorists took over, were guarded only by 3-4 guards each, and these guards had a mall guard training. In conclusion if u watched 2 or 3 action movies u know exactly what to expect during this one, from the beginning to the end.Finally, you might ask why did i give the movie the grade of 6.Two reasons: 1. I actually enjoyed watching it. 2. I didn't expect much, so i wasn't disappointed.I definitely won't see it again but i recommend to watch it once, it'll take your mind off your life for an hour and a half :)",6,1,3,13 July 2007
