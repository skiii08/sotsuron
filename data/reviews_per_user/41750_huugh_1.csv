Kill Bill: Vol. 2," bullshit
","Unfortunately I have seen this and I want to warn you, don't watch it! Totally dumb, boring piece of s**t, piteous acting, imbecile plot (actually NO plot presence in this crap) and all the time worse than Hong-Kong action movies from 70s. Volume 1 was quite good, nothing exceptional but watchable without hazarding with your health, imho this vol.2 was extended to 2hours just for money-making just when from whole story left about 5 lines in screenplay of volume 1, so why don't make sequel, a lot of little green papers will become handy just for nothing, what a deal! So don't wonder about 5 and more minutes long monologues over lying (and probably dying) enemy, what should probably symbolize that there is something like a plot behind 5 year old kiddies would make a better movie Quarantino's worst movie, actually worst movie I have ever seen",1,25,50,23 July 2004
