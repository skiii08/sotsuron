Vertigo," Death By Fetish
","Once upon a time I was someone's Judy, and there was a terrible film noir falling into a psychedelic spiral feeling, when I found a photograph of the ex before me, which might as well have been a small mirror, I was being groomed to match up with reflection wise. People are strange, fetishes are stranger.... Anyway first time I saw this I was too young to understand it, 'Hitchcock's just being willfully weird this time' I remember saying to a friend. Now its like a saw across bone without anesthesia. Also its Hitchcocks most beautiful film, with the greatest sense of color and mise en scene, possibly his most complex script. It's deadly accurate psycho-analysis. Jimmy Stewart is creepy as hell in this too. Hitchcock has been written about so much, I wont waste the words trying to dig out something new, but I can say it's one of about his 5 legitimate film masterpieces. 'You shouldn't keep souvenir's of a killing, you shouldn't have been that sentimental...'",10,4,10,28 April 2009
Come and See," Seeing Is Believing (The Best War Film Ever Made)
","Come And See is the best war film ever made. Throughout the film we watch a young boy enthusiastically dig out a gun buried in the earth and join up with his countrymen to fight off the Nazi invasion, only to have his boyhood fantasies of heroism, literally burnt alive.The young actor Aleksei Kravchenko looks nearly unrecognizable by film's end; the bags under his eyes have bags under their eyes. We observe the war entirely from his position, where a girl majestically dancing in a rainstorm can transition without warning to bombs falling on a forest camp.The boy tries to leave his company at one point, and return to his village. When he left his mother gave him his rifle and said, 'You might as well shoot us now. We'll die if you leave.' Though we never find out one way or the other, his house is abandoned and he assumes the worst. The boy's ears are damaged from the bombs and going deaf and perhaps mad with grief, he wades out into a bog.He finds himself in another village where he hides amongst a group of farmers he was planning to rob. The Nazis show up and begin the round up for a massacre. We watch what happens first hand, like a Nazi officer's girlfriend shown eating lobster as a barn full of people is set on fire. The boy gets a chance at revenge, but it doesn't change anything. The film closes with the boy firing at a statue of Hitler, and here the film plays documentary footage of the war flowing backward, the bombs go back into the sky, the people come out of the cattle cars, the goose-stepping parades flow in reverse, until finally we reach an image of Hitler as a baby.The next shot is of the boys withered face as if hes looking at the photograph too, realizing that even Hitler was young and innocent as he was once, and likewise Once Upon A Time went off to fight for country. No war film has ever left me so drained, and the only other film that goes into as much brutal detail of victimization is maybe Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (love it or hate it, in that film you go through an emotional experience). The Russian's suffered the greatest casualties in WW2, more than any of the allies or the Axis powers and depending on how you arrange them, more than some nations put together.Their tightening cultural grip came as the result of the tremendous scar of the War, much the way Germany became brutal after their losses in World War 1.Elem Klimov captures war as a universal psychological scar, where demonization and glorification only amount to momentary denials of its terrible scale and depth. There was no place to root for the hero, only a skeletal hope that he would survive, though at times you think he might be better off if he didn't. Visually it's similar to a Andrei Tarkovsky or Bella Tar over the shoulder long walks and slow pans style. There are no real shoot outs; the war is a presence either felt as sudden bombs or swarms of Nazi's barking command. Come and See is a surreal, disturbing, and intense coming of age film, hypnotic and horrific in equal parts. Director Elem Klimov never made another film after it saying, 'everything you could do with cinema I had already done.' Though at the other end of the spectrum Quinten Tarantino's Inglorious Bustards shows you can teach an old dog some new tricks, Come and See is for realistic war films as good as I could possibly imagine a World War 2 or any War film could be.",10,2,2,9 May 2010
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash Puny Box Office
","Come to think of it, ballet has a lot in common with super hero comics...the story being merely an excuse, a framework to show off the artists skill with the form. That and the melodrama...the acrobatics...and the tights...'-Bryan Talbot Even though this movie makes some small attempts at back story, it's very easy to view this movie as a sequel to Ange Lee's Hulk, for instance Ang Lee's film ends with Banner in South America, and this film begins with Banner in South America. Like many sequels, we begin with action already taking place, and characters who already have experiences with each other. Unlike Lee's Oedipul Comic Book come to screen, 'The Incredible Hulk', exchanges pathos for chance to see Hulk slug it out on a crowded downtown street with 'The Abomination'(another big mutated guy). If super hero stories are action ballet's where the central character is just a big symbolic suite(or costume), to add some differentiation between this particular dance, and the next one, than the Incredible Hulk, is well worth the watching if only for it's exercises in special effect slug fests between giant monsters(which is at the heart of every Hulk comic). The first movie set up the pins of the story(but lacked a substantial comic book villain, the Oedipal stuff with the father made sense it just didn't make the most thrilling action spectacle to watch), this film while having no emotional core to the volatile Hulk/Banner dichotomy, does have plenty of 'Hulk Smash!', not as charming, and appealing as Iron Man. Good for those who like the ballet, bad for those who can't kick without content.",6,0,4,16 June 2008
Marie Antoinette," Beautiful, decadent, and disappointing
","The soundtrack was good, and was used cleverly, but it wasn't enough to save the story which given the Sophia Coppola 'let's just show our protagonist looking around and being isolated, and in pretty dresses', just kind of washes out, and just leaves you wanting, but not in a begging 'Lost In Translation' way. There's not much historical context and important information like the age of the characters, Antionette is fourteen when she is first married, is left out, as is the more dramatic political later years and execution which might have redeemed the rest of the film's earlier fluff. Minimizing history and doggedly rejecting psychology, Marie Antionette, becomes the story of a teenage girl who buys lots of stuff, and engages in the sensual decadence of the world around her. Attempting to engage modern teenage girls with a historical character is an intriguing idea, especially via pop music, however the ideas all but end here, and were just left to wander through the beautiful french palaces and estates, with no more idea of why or what we are doing here than Antoinette herself, which I again understand and appreciate, however just because we cant engage the environment and context, doesn't mean we should be shut off from the subject as well, instead we should be delving deeper into the characters. This does not happen and so we are left looking at a clever advertisement for an idea, rather than the idea itself.",Null,0,1,12 December 2007
I'm Not There," One Of The Best Films Of The Year
","Amazing, great performances, great script, great directing, great concept, I normally stay away from Biopics because they tend to either demonize or hero worship, especially when it comes to musicians. Tood Haynes uses fragmentation as a device to show us parts and aspects of a personality emphasizing that there is no one 'real' person ever really present within anyone, just lots of idealizations, frailties, passions, dreams, fears, and projections, a series of persona. He demonstrates this by using six different actors(of various races, genders, and ages) to play various aspects of Bob Dylan's personality, career, and life.The soundtrack which uses a lot of original Dylan songs as well as covers, adds to the confusion of identity. Now normally with a film of this scope, it's easy for it to become swallowed by it's own audacity, but 'Im Not There' doesn't miss a beat. My favorite film of 07, and instantly one of my top ten all time favorites. About as smart, literate, and enjoyable as films get.",10,1,2,11 June 2008
Fight Club," The Irony
","The movie is not the twist, it's the movie. Surrounded by hype, and a video game tie in(irony), it's still a great adaptation of an alright book. Like it or not this movie had a big impact on a lot of people, not mentioning those who actually started less philosophically concerned fight clubs of their own(i can think of a few sadly). It's not the greatest movie ever made, though it will be for a while for some(blush). It's another in a line of effective points of zeitgeist for modern counter-culture (The Matrix, Donnie Darko, etc.) and all that jazz, but it is effective. And the actors Pitt, Norton, Cater, and even Meat Loaf, all turn out iconic performances. As a great movie moment in transgressive literature it works, but not the best movie ever. Good for what it is, if you can sift through the hype and the violence.",8,0,2,11 June 2008
Hostel," Hostel Skirts Hype And Manages New Horror
","This is a film for horror fans, if you don't really, really like horror films(gore included), I mean really, than don't see it. The first half of the film before the characters arrive at their destination is all frat boyish American fantasy European road trip film, which is later mirrored and satirized in the events of horror that actually take place. Though the film is full of extreme gore and violence(and a pretty cool ode to 'Suicide Club'), there was a lot more subtlety to the story than I expected, though I cant imagine too many people really looking at it for anything other than the violence. It was a lot better than I expected, but not 'the scariest film ever' that it is claimed to be. I'm also sick of Quentin Tarintino sticking his name on everything, its just a trick to confuse people who aren't paying attention, and as always giving him way more credit than he deserves(see Hero). There are also subtle themes about globalization and exploitation here, a critical view of the American and westerner in general who feel they can 'buy' anything, which also asks us as 'horror' fans what 'price' we are willing to pay to see our violent collective fantasies laid out.",7,4,5,13 December 2007
Superbad," Pop Status Achieved
","If teen comedies about guys trying to 'get some' have to exist, than they should at least be as unabashadly obsessed with their own genitals, as Superbad. I don't know if this will hold up as the 'intant classic' everyone's dubbing it, but it's funny in it's own right. The friendship is believable and the antics tangible to contemporary audiences in a way that a lot of films, particularly those of the teen comedy have not been. If your someone easily turned off(as I am) by overzealous marketing, than understandably your going to think twice before going anywhere near this film. However, if you can pass this stumbling block, you'll be rewarded in laughter what you surrender in time.",Null,1,4,12 December 2007
Juno," She's Having A Baby sort off...
","Juno- Oh those witty pregnant teens. It was okay actually, the dialogue was funny, but pretty stilted after a point, specially towards the end. I wasn't really looking forward to going to the free screening, but I was pretty entertained the whole way through, it was better than I expected. A lot of movies aiming for endearing cute quirkyness are either stale or forced, or transparent. And though this was guilty of all of those at times, they are not too numerous to drag it down completely. Better than 'She's Having A Baby', it's most immediate rival, which indeed it excels beyond in terms of range of human drama. The end, for all it's adorability still strikes a wrong chord with me, like the ending of Garden State, it's becomes overwhelmed with sentimentality, which is supposed to excuse the lack of honest resolution, the film has made it's heart, 'what is going to happen to this quirky young pregnant girl', apparently nothing too drastic, she get's a boy she likes and continues as normal. The most important theme of this film is responsibility, not the actual pregnancy, but how different people at different points in their life are at different levels, which they and they alone can truly determine, which is refreshing in it's own way. I wouldn't go out and rent it again, but if it came on TV I wouldn't immediately turn.",Null,2,7,12 December 2007
Spider-Man 3," How The Mighty Have Fallen
","I expected this movie to be cheesy and stupid, I mean it's Spider-Man. Even at his very best, Spider Man is still a pretty goofy arch-typical boy hero, dealing with teeny relationship and identity issues. What makes Spider-Man endearing is that he has superpowers and goes on adventures. The problem with this movie is that these normal Spiderman problems were treated way to seriously here, the melodrama between Mary Jane, Parker, and Osbourne got embarissingly thick, with not enough Spidey action to dilute it(though were there was action it was pretty cool). The 'i'm evil and now have emo bangs in my face' didn't help either, the dance sequence if nothing else helped break up the monotony. The Sandman birth sequence was beautiful though, that minute and half of the movie was the best part of the film. If this film wasn't going for realism it shouldn't have injected the constant tear fests, because this tells the audience they're supposed to be emotionally involved with these ridiculous poorly acted characters. The result can only be awkward laughter and distancing of the viewer from the fantasy world they were immersed in. You can't hero worship someone you don't respect, and the redemption/forgiveness scenario come too little to late, to have their intended effect. This might have made an interesting animated film, but on camera it's just not enough. That being said, I still had fun seeing it in theaters, it is Spider-Man after all, I just wouldn't want to watch it again, exception being the action parts.",Null,0,1,12 December 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Not Quite Gold, But A Shinny Silver True And True
","Hellboy 2 is yet another film with summer fever, the symptoms of which consist of adrenaline pumping and jaw dropping special effects, imaginative designs, snappy dialog, and plots and characterizations not worth the ink that wrote them.Like 'Iron Man', 'The Incredible Hulk', 'Indiania Jones', etc, it's a fun ride, and like them as well, at the end there's' not much to think about, and the more you may think back the less and less satisfied you may become with all the non 'super' portions of the movie.I will say this of all the summer fodder, so far, Hellboy was the one I found the most entertaining. Hellboy, was never the most well written comic in the world, it's charms lie largely with the artwork and the way relatively unknown mythologies from all around the globe get blended into the classic troupes of pulp comicdom. In the film this translates into talking psychic mermen named after Abraham Lincoln, Ghostly non corporeal German doctors bound in their fishbowl suits (and voiced by Seth Mcfarlan...the same voice used for the evil German dr. in the body of the goldfish from American Dad), a grown up version of Stepehen Kings 'Firestarter', forest elementals, cannibalistic pixies, and the anti-Christ himself acting more like 'The Thing' from 'The Fantastic Four', down to the cigars.Helllboy was never that great of a story in and of itself, and here is no exception. The villain is particularly non threatening or sympathetic (the characters of Shrek and Neverending Story make better claims for there fairly-lands).Good combination of CGI and traditional special effects. Good characters in a stale melodrama, which doesn't mix well with the action adventure portion of the story. Its worth seeing for the sheer spectacle, a good combo of the images of Pans and Hellboy 1, but not too much of the brains or heart of either.Which is not to say I didn't like it, though stiff in places it does perfectly capture the super-adventure in it's bizarre and ridiculous glory. Though the summer sickness, can reduce a film to ashes often quickly enough, with Hellboy it's produced a conventional, but still dazzling fever dream",7,1,5,14 July 2008
Cloverfield," The Beast Returns
","One of the most enjoyable movie going experiences I've had in a long while. There is an inordinate amount of references from critics to this films 9/11 visual allusions, which I think are more projected than anything. There is an essay called 'The Imagination Of Disaster' by Susan Sontag, which can really be applied to this film in a lot of ways. One thing Sontag notes is the depiction of the scientific/military/industrial complex in monster/disaster films; the heroic scientist, The UN security councils, the hard ass general, the plucky journalist, the madman's daughter, etc, all of which distract us from the people being killed in the exploding buildings. Cloverfield, doesn't give us a tour through aesthetic destruction, nor does it re-enforce the political models of the salvation through military force, it confines itself in the most literal sense to showing people caught in a terrifying and surreal experience. The last Godzilla film with Mathew Broderick showed New York being destroyed, but this didn't point to 9/11, so much as it points to our obsession with New York as the center symbol of modern American life and achievement, it's buildings are the great symbols of modern urban life, something terrorists and science fiction writers understand as they knock them down. The first thing that happens in this film action wise is the statue of liberty having it's head knocked off, does this mean liberty is dead, the country is without a liberated mind, or is it just a reference to the poster for 'Escape From New York('another NY disaster flick), or is it all of the above? These aren't really appropriate questions for Cloverfield, which is a film without answers, but a clever one that subverts a lot of the cliché's of the monster movie genre, without any pretensions(save its advertising campaign). What I liked about this movie so much was that it was just the camera, a few people, and some monsters, and it was gripping stuff. A fifty foot monster is much scarier if it's too big to capture on camera, only seen at a glance surrounded by screams and debris, something I cant think another film doing. The shabbiness of the camera at first made me a little dizzy, but it improves as the film goes on. I actually think this kind of film making has a much bigger future than people think, another film this year 'The Diving Bell and The Butterfly' used a very similar technique of withholding camera perspective to very different and very successful effect. All and all, I thought it was really good, scary even at times, and much better than any modern monster movie I can think of, maybe not 'The Host', but then again...Anyway If there is any art to making monster movies, Cloverfield is it's new watermark, and is going to be the one to beat in the future. It ends and begins on Conney Island a day spent reliving old thrills from the past in ends there as well, as we relive our great Godzilla fantasies and fears.",8,0,2,29 February 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," To Shavee-Da Face...
","After a second viewing I enjoyed this a lot more, the first time around I was so caught off guard, it was a bit alienating. I hadn't expected the wall to wall classical musical theater that I got here, but for what it is, it works. Tim Burton does a good job of mixing in plenty of violence and black comedy, to keep the story moving along, but there are a few too many scenes that seem better designed for the stage than the screen.I'm sure on stage signing in a solitary dilapidated building has a great emotional impact, on screen though it just gets kind of repetitive and boring. The songs translate best when at their are most onieric, whether Todd is fantasizing about running through the streets blades in hand or Mr. Lovett dreaming of their house by the sea, Burton's imagination is at it's most engaging and the film is too.But aside from that it was good, it's a musical about a murderous barber slicing people's throats and his assistant baking them into meat pies. The film is at it's weakest when it goes for melodrama, I enjoyed it more than most musicals and I can see how fans of theater will get a definite kick out of it, but for me the campier 'Little Shop Of Horrors' and 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' will always hold the gold standard for musical horror/comedy theater.",6,0,0,12 June 2008
Shutter Island," Shiver's Cove
","From the first image in this film doesn't it look like Leonardo Dicaprio is already regretting his decision to be in this movie, is Teddy regretting going to the island. The answer doesn't much matter, because none of the answers waiting at the end of 'Shutter Island' matter. Answers to plot points are just the carrot leading our hero from one way too symbolic hallucination and dream sequence after another.'Shutter Island' is 'Jacob's Ladder' with some 'Manchurian Candidate' thrown in there, under a general Hitchcock umbrella. 'Session Nine' as a made for t.v. melodrama. It was okay, like 'The Departed' which preceded it, this will be remembered as one of Scorcese's best, but it was entertaining.'Don't Look Now' and the other two I mentioned are better a this type of mind-f7.k pulp, and 'Bringing Out The Dead', and 'The Last Temptation Of Christ', have better Scorcese hallucination sequences too. The performances were all done though. I especially liked Elias Koteas' brief one eyed arsonists, especially after last year's body-artist serial killer in 'I Come With The Rain', he's making racket out of the soft spoken maniac, the way Anthony Hopkins used to (or still kinda does considering 'The Woflman').Predictable for the most part, but the extended dream sequences were better than most and narrowly (but just barely at times) avoided some 'Number 23'-esque embarrassments. I wish the average mainstream film would be at least this caliber, but because the average is so low, something like 'Shutter Island' ends up looking allot better than it really is by comparison.It's all an illluuuuussssiiioon! I enjoyed it for what it was, but I doubt this will be anyone's favorite movie.",5,0,2,9 May 2010
Top Secret!," The Long Lost ZAZ Comedy Classic!
","The long last ZAZ spoof, from the director/writers trio who gave us 'The Naked Gun', 'Hot Shots', and 'Airplane'. The three absurdist comic savants, produced one other spoof after airplane but before 'The Naked Gun' with 'Top Secret!'.An America...(read more) n pop star, is invited to sing in East Germany, but the evil 'west' Germans???, are conspiring to use the concert to take over both sides of the country, and only Val Kilmer and his constant Elvis songs and imitations can save the day? Well the Zaz guys were never big on plot, if you've seen the type of film they are spoofing you should be well aware of the conventions, which is maybe why this film is as little remembered as it's peers, it's attempting to spoof multiple 'genres' at once.I've never really seen any of the old Elvis musicals, so a lot of the humor in the musical moments falls flat, and confuses, when your waiting for more spy and espionage gags.Not quite as good as their other more well known films, but good viewing for those interested in the mile a minute, absurdist visual gags and slapstick and vernacular jokes that only these guys could do, after Woody Allen and Mel Brooks the comic torch for the 80's passed through the hands of the trio Zaz, where it continued on past Kevin Smith and the Wayans to Judd Apatow and co, and beyond.Oh and it was funny too.",7,1,1,14 July 2008
The Orphanage," The Ghostly Child Formula Endures...Yet Again!
","My girlfriend thought it was really suspenseful and quite scary, other than a few moments of general unease I was bored, and never really frightened by any of the ghostly occurrences, the truck out of nowhere made me jump a bit, but overall I was disappointed, it was a well made and very polished film, but it lacked any weight or real sense of horror. A slightly above mediocre thriller/mystery. Might be a welcome addition for fans of traditional ghosts stories, those looking for something different, or something which produced genuine frights look elsewhere. Decent performances and direction but nothing that won't be forgotten in a decade or so",3,12,22,1 March 2008
City of God," Awesome and Uncanny
","There are a lot of films about kids in 3rd world conditions going down violent paths, but rarely are these accounts as first hand, expansive, and compelling as City Of God. There's a vibrancy, urgency, compassion, and scope that makes this movie so hard to pull away from. The story of a boy named Rocket trying to escape and being pulled back into the violent conditions around him, as well as the local history that created this environment. We see generations of slumlords few old enough to drive, come and go, in ages and empires, of drugs and fashions from the 60's to the 70's. Most of the performers here are not actors but children from the infamous slum, including Brazilian pop star Sue Jorge(seen in the Life Aquatic seeing David Bowie songs) who also grew up there. There's an immediacy, honesty, and energy to this film that 90 percent of films about gangsters, street life, and the 3rd world miss. No glorifications of excess, just poverty, desire, hope, and ignorance, put in a blender and set to f*^k all. Anyway, excellent from start to finish. One of my favorite films of all time.",10,0,2,12 June 2008
Hellboy," Red Horns Do It Better...
","Great comic series, good times on screen. Del Toro doesn't capture the shadowiness and the Gothic art of the books, but does the get the heart of the material, and plays it well between lighthearted comedy, lighthearted action, and as much weirdness(talking corpses, psychic merman, pyroknesis, Rasputin, clockwork Nazi assassins, and Cthulu, to name a few of the flourishes), as the story can handle.It is a super-hero movie, but one that mixes in occult myths, weird tales, and conspiracy theories, into a fine entertainment brew. Can't wait to see the next installment in the 'The Golden Army'. One of the best comic to film adaptations, not for style, but for heart and for fun's sake.",8,4,4,11 June 2008
The Mist," Like the fog but easier to get off your windshield...
","A mysterious mist surrounds a grocery store, and there are hostile, dangerous, and impossible things surrounding them outside, after a few days of either wrong or no decision, fanaticism rises from within...One of the better King stories and adaptations, considering Dream Catchers and Hearts In Atlantis. Though the development of the story and characters are better here, more fully developed, however it's undoing is it's not actually very scary. It could be scary, it's got all the potential for Lovecraft-like nightmarishness, but it remained as Jurassic Park by way of Shirley Jackson's 'The Lottery', with a twist at the end, and it could have been more. The workings of faith versus the unknown are bold, especially in our current political climate, this theme holds up the story beyond a lot of recent horror, sf, and fantasy, it just only goes so far, the gas runs out, and it ends/offs itself, prematurely.",Null,0,2,12 December 2007
Kick-Ass," With Great Fanboyishness Comes Great Responsibility
","Everything before the appearance of Hit Girl was at least interesting, after that the head of the movie goes so far up its own ass, it can perform its own colonoscopy, which it then proceeds to do, as what I'm sure some would call satire. Mark Millar's hacky writing that's made him a 5th tier mainstream comic writer is present here as ever. If this is a good adaptation of the comic (which I gave up on after issue 2) then it's a faithful adaptation of a bad book. 'Mystery Men' and 'Blank Man' with a little girl who calls people a 'c&^t' and plenty of references to YouTube-is that what's passing for edgy and original these days...agro Juno? The strain of creatively impoverished Millar writing can be traced from 'Wanted', to 'Kick Ass' and the Iron Man franchise. For instance, Samuel L. Jackson is in the new 'Iron Man 2' because Millar had artists model their new Nick Fury after him in his 'Ultimate's' comic's series. When Alan Moore says that modern comics are now just a spawning ground for bigger commercial properties and merchandise, Millar is looking more and more the eager grounds keeper. His books come with headshots in mind.'With Kick-Ass, the books just out and now the movie's out six weeks later. And I think that's the way things are going to go now, because to go to Marvel's B and C-list characters and try to get movies out them – what's the point of that?'-Mark Millar. I know this is the way Kubrick went about '2001', but this ain't 2001. Concerning, B and C, characters I would gladly take a 'Howard the Duck' sequel any day over Super-Bad kid doing the world's worst Batman quote at the end of a movie.As for Mathew Vaughn as director, 'Kick Ass' combines the worst of his last two films; the Guy Richie rip off of 'Layer Cake' is now replaced by embarrassingly brazen Tarantino worship, and the stiffeled/self-congratulatory attempts at graphic-novel adaptation in 'Stardust' is present and accounted for here. Vaughn financed the film himself, so calling this a soulless studio product isn't accurate or necessary. Bad indie movies get made too...agro Juno is actually more accurate than I suspected when I started writing this.At the beginning Kick-Ass tells us how he isn't like your daddy's super-heroes no alien origins or dead parents to avenge, no powers or skills etc., but an hour later, were cheering on Hit-Girl's Matrix/28 Days Later/Silence Of The Lambs/Kill Bill reference laden revenge for her slaughtered father, and watching jet-packs streak across the sky. Roger Ebert went too far connecting 'Kick-Ass' to Columbine and Virginia Tech. A movie can be bad without being the end of western civilization, and though Kick-Ass isn't very good. Children and Old people swearing will always have produce a knee jerk ironic laugh, like a fat man with high pitched voice, or a short person with a deep Barry White voice, and so Kick-Ass has it's moments of amusement(largely thanks to Nicolas Cage).With great fan-boyishness comes great responsibility, and if super-heroes have any meaning at all, it should be about more than just kicking ass. If your reply to that 'But then what else is there?', then just forget everything I've said, this is the movie for you.",4,22,46,9 May 2010
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Bullet With Butterfly Wings
","If you enjoyed 'Princess Mononoke' and 'Akira', Nausicaa of The Valley Of The Winds, is a welcome addition to the great lineage of epic action anime.This early Miyazaki film, based on his own manga of the same name, based in turn on a Japanese myth of a Princess who speaks to insects, is a sc-fi adventure story set hundreds of years in the future where the world has become a gigantic and dense overgrown jungle surrounded by toxic wastelands. Worm like creatures hundreds of feet long and high live amongst humans like natural disasters as well as smaller similarly mutated creatures throughout the gargantuan jungles.Like the best of Miyazki's anime this film is aimed at all audiences, though the violence at times seem more suited for adult films. Movies must either have new images, or die out, and in the world of animation, regardless of CGI, the only animated film maker I can think of producing really new images today is Hayao Miyazaki, until this film for instance, I had never imagined riding a a metallic glider through a mountainous jungle hunting a giant worm, and now I will never forget.In honesty Nausica is'nt quite as good 'Akira' and 'Princess Mononoke', but it's up there with 'Howls Moving Castle', 'Spritied Away', and 'Ghost In The Shell', which are pretty much the best anime (and probably the only few worth seeing...let me know if I'm off base here) there are anyway.",7,0,2,19 June 2008
Transformers," I Know It's Micheal Bay But...
","...I enjoyed this. The plot takes a few leaps in logic, but this is as to be expected for a movie about giant robots who transform into cars and assorted vehicles. Actually until the transformers speak it's a semi- realistic sci-fi film, after which it's just the Transformers cartoon, 'we are good they are evil, let's fight!', which they do a lot of, which pleased me. It's basically a boys with toy's story, except the car to win the dream girl is sentient and out to save the earth. The films big draw is that giant robots trash each other in a crowded metropolitan area, and that was present. If this kind of thing doesn't interest you, your probably not gonna like this. Occasionally it was difficult for me to establish who was fighting who, until I realized this didn't matter, and was able to enjoy in my childish(infantile) fantasy comes to life before me. The original Animated film is actually a much more unique and stylized experience, but this was good too, by good I mean 'special effects/action scenarios', nothing else worth mentioning. If you can confine your viewing pleasure to this narrow regressive childlike space though, good times.",5,0,2,12 December 2007
Children of Men," In Utero
","Wow, I can't remember the last time I was this emotionally involved in a film. Apacolypto was pretty heart stopping too, but the stakes are raised from fate of one family to fate of the world, and the execution here is nearly perfect. There's very little exposition on the state of the world, much of the back-story is communicated indirectly, TV's, radio's, newspapers etc, which can make it a little hard to piece together fully, if your not paying attention. The drama is unrelenting, the camera work amazing, the music is great, the dialoge especially the conversational bits I thought was pretty natural and worked well to create a false sense of security (moments of quiet before the storm). The Pink Floyd house was great. I couldn't imagine anyone with a pulse not at least being engrossed by this.",Null,1,13,12 December 2007
The Evil Dead," 'Bound In Human Flesh And Inked In Blood....'
","It's been one of my favorite horror films since the first time I saw it, when I was too young to know what I was getting into. Sam Raimi ain't the best director in the world, but he did invent the Raimi-Rush here, a technique which no one besides him ...(read more)has ever really used to as great effect.Anyway, this is Bruce Campbell, in a small shack in the woods, with a few friends who accidentally summon the demon spirits of the woods, and are one by one possessed and transformed.There's severed human hands crawling of their own accords, a woman raped by a forest, and more blood, gore, and hilarity intentional or not, than you will find in the thousands of films which imitate this one. A horror classic, that's more inventive and raucous than scary. Also the beginning of a trilogy in the saga of Bruce Campbell's Ash character in the horror slapstick 'Evil Dead 2', and the full on epic mid-evil parody of 'Army Of Darkness' both fun films, too but it all starts here. And it was never truly as good. 'We can't bury Linda...she's our friend!'",10,2,4,12 June 2008
Black Snake Moan," Black man chains white girl to radiator, we all learn a lot.
","Better than I expected from a film selling itself on the premise of nymphomania and inter-racial bondage. The music is great, and cinematography focuses greatly on turning Ricci into a trailer trash Betty Paige and it works. Samuel L. get's to shout a lot, which he's good at, as well as play lots of blues guitar, which he looks cool doing. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I get the feeling that this material under anyone else would have been complete s*%#, but instead managed to just barley carve out it's own odd little transgressive pulp niche, while still being an effective drama.",7,2,5,9 July 2007
The Dark Knight," A Bat-Man For All Seasons (The Killing Joke)
","Best Bat-Man movie. Cus it understands Bat-man, The Joker, Two-Face, are symbols, not people, and that Bat-Man himself is the least interesting character in the Bat-Man story (he's a character defined by his villains and this movie get's that).Also script-writers with Nolan have either been doing their homework with some of Bat-Man's best stories, or else just got impossibly coincidental with how similar this is to a few comics. Alan Moore's 'The Killing Joke' for Joker's explanations of his origins(a joke in and of itself), Frank Miller's 'Dark Knight' for the fake average Joe Bat-Men, a few traces of Grant Morisson's 'Arkahm Asylumn', etc.Anyway you really could go on and on about talking about how great ALL of the actors are, how Heath Ledger's cackle sounds like the 60's TV show and Jack Nicholson and something else, all at once, but you can see that much more clearly for yourselves.A morally complex super-hero movie? Bat-Man with allegorical symbolism (Batman sitting on one shoulder, Joker the other, Harvey Dent as the middle-man) and political commentary (from Joker's dead soldiers remarks to Morgan Freeman's 'privacy' outrage)? Who knows, but I liked that for all the 'blockbusters' this summer, this is the only one I can more about than just 'awesome special effects'.I love Tim Burton's films and they did a great job, capturing a particular style of the Batman world (especially aesthetically; costumes, buildings, cars, villains), but if Bat-Man can be useful, at all in saying anything relevant, other than justice is good and evil bad, than this is his finest hour, and most entertaining to and a half to watch.",9,2,5,21 July 2008
The Legend of 1900," Music Fom The Sea
","1900: 'Take piano: keys begin, keys end. You know there are 88 of them. Nobody can tell you any different. They are not infinite. You're infinite... And on those keys, the music that you can make... is infinite. I like that. That I can live by...' One of the best films I ever stumbled across, and one of the most underrated. An orphan born on a ship in the year 1900, becomes a piano prodigy, and spends his life with the passengers and crew, unable or unwilling to set foot on land. The Piano duel, the sliding storm, and the recording session being the most fun, beautiful, and exhilarating scenes in an American drama in a long time. Great film.",10,1,4,11 June 2008
The Descent," One Of The Decades Best Horror Films
","It's bleak and tragic, manages to invert and avoids a few cliché's, and the directing, sound, and especially lighting are pretty good. The stories nothing special, but that's not what's important here, it's the claustrophobic, dark, lost, nightmarish quality that all horror films seek, but rarely achieve, that is captured really well here. Anyway, I saw it for free, and I thought it was good, I'm tired of CG ghosts(as I'm sure you are too). Make sure you watch the UK Ending too, it's the icing on the cake, literally, the US version is s*%$.I don't mean to subtract too much from the story, but at the time this was coming out I think there was another horror film called, 'The Cave'.'The Descent' was made first though it was released in the states after, and though their basically about the same thing, which is people fighting monsters in a cave, 'The Cave' was every horror/action cliché you could imagine, while this managed to generate genuine suspense and a sense of doom, as well as the usual gore. Also it includes an all female cast, a rarity in horror films, especially since the characters are not just sexualized teens. One of the best horror films of the past decade, which serves as a working example that a talented director, writer, cast and crew can make any idea into something worth viewing.",7,2,4,13 December 2007
The Happening," Good Horror, Not The Greatest Shyamalan(but NOT that bad)
","M. Night Shyamalan, tries to make a summer horror movie, with no pretensions. The problem lies that pretensions are what make some artist's good, it's their ambition(insane, and annoying at times though it may be), that makes them so vital. 'Lady In ...(read more)The Water' was ridiculous but it was interesting, it's arguable, it has ideas greater than itself. 'The Happening' is an example of what you see is what you get. There is no twist here, just survival and some thin guess work for a plot, some very intense sequences, and an ending which has some subtle hints at environmental crisis and the woes of global self-destruction.People continuously go see Nights movies expecting 'revelations', when at best he's made some clever twists and subversion's of standard speculative fiction conventions; ghosts, superheros, aliens, fairy tales, utopias and monster myths, etc. He stands out as much as he does because he makes interesting genre films in places other's wont tread, or tread poorly. At a time when all movies are either franchise attempts or remakes or both, it's nice to see someone(anyone), at least try and think of something new.It just feels like people expect Night to be Hitchcock, when really he's somewhere between him and Larry Cohen.So what's left is a good pop corn horror film, with some original images, good music, a few awkward bits in the dialog, but over all decent writing with some light comedic touches(very needed), for effect. I think as a director overall he's grown, while as a story teller, he may be running on steam. Even though it's not as thought provoking as his other films, it's got all the suspense and dramatic tension, audiences have been waiting for since 'Signs'. So a little disappointing, but overall still worth checking out.(Spoiler Following): There's a lot places the plot could have actually gone, there are theories that the evolution of flowers helped wipe out the dinosaurs, which I was just sure this movie would mention, but it Dian't...or maybe something more with communication between human and plants(hinted, joked at, but never done). The movie makes it clear that 'man' is the problem, like the ending of 'Planet Of The Apes', one can imagine M. Night Shyamalan somewhere on a beach banging his fists into the sand shouting 'You blew it up you maniacs' at the statue of Liberty, however in 2008, pointing out that man is self destructive an enemy of the environment of the planet, is like shooting fish in a barrel. Every movie from Godzilla to Frankenstien tries to point out how were messing up the natural balance, only Night doesn't seem to see any possible end in sight, just the beginnings of crests on a terrible wave of future problems(which is fair, and if nothing else honest), and so it seems the optimist of 'Lady In The Water' and 'Signs' where we had hope and each other to believe in, has finally given in to modern pessimism (remember all those cars driving away from the dinner)...were all f*&ked, we are a disease...but at least we got movies.",7,2,8,16 June 2008
There Will Be Blood," My Milkshake Brings All The Boys To The Yard
","At first I was a little disappointed, I came out of the theater after what felt like forever and I couldn't really make out what I had seen. The performances are as good as you are likely to see anywhere, visually it's stunning with moments of beauty(the fire), but for me the music is really what carried this movie, which opens sounding like '2001' and ends sounding like 'Clockwork Orange', Kubrik seems like a driving influence here, and for the most part it works seamlessly and really propells the film through some of it's slower moments. However, he story does takes a bit too long to unfold, there could have been a cut or two here and there, but nothing major. That being said, it's one of those movies which I couldn't grasp the first time around, ('Babel was another of these, which I love now), but whose scenes end up playing themselves out over and over days later. It's a less technical and less sentimental Citizen Cane, which though technically set before that film, is much more topical, showing oil, ambition, and fundamentalist Christianity at a unique juncture in history that ends up, if not mirroring our own modern time, than definitely refracting it. Better than No Country For Old Men, in verisimilitude of performances, it's ability to mix humor and repulsion, and it's construction, which is less formulaic than No Country, and more satisfying. So yeah it's worthy of it's hype, if only for it's last ten minutes, which contain one of those instant 'classic' scenes that comes around rarely. 'I drink YOUR MILKSHAKE! I drink it up!'",10,3,7,29 February 2008
Iron Man," Paid For By Stark Enterprises
","Entertaining, but not nearly as good as advertised. Robert Downey Jr. is more fun to watch as Tony Stark than Peter Paker in SpiderMan, or Batman for that matter, if only because he's not the tormented hero struggling with his conscious, he's a billionaire playboy who even when escaping with his life is enjoying building himself a high tech cyborg armor. Pathos is replaced with on screen charisma and witty snappy dialog, and all actors play there parts well here. My only problem was that while Stark get's plenty of screen time, I feel like Iron Man only showed up for the last half hour of the film, which I guess is common enough in this origin stories, but still made the whole thing feel kind of uneven to me. I get the impression if the director, actors, writers stay together for the next film they might have ironed out the bugs. (SPOILER)The next film could be the super-hero jamboree 'The Avengers', as indicated by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, at the end of the credits. And this character might do better in a cross over. Like Spider Man and Batman this film is pretty close to how I always envisioned the character, there's just not enough action and hero screen time here. Still it's a super-hero movie for people who don't necessarily care for them, and that's saying a lot. So enjoyable, not great, but good.",7,1,2,12 June 2008
Blade Runner," 'More Human Than Human is Our Motto'
","Someone asked me whats the point of this besides 'Replicants are human too, duh'. I think it isn't that in 'Blade Runner' the Replicants are human too, they are the ONLY humans.Deckard, the three scientists who are in charge of designing, the eyes, the body, and the brains, of the Replicants, and Edward James Olmos, are all just doing their job. They exist to serve a function, and to perform a task and they do so, like machines. The scientists are practically on an assembly line, each designing a piece, so as not to comprehend the meaning of the whole. 'The eyes are the window to the soul' Rutger Haur notes, meeting the man who designed his eyes, yet this man knows nothing. The first image in Blade Runner, is a close up on eye with the city reflected from it, as if within the soul there is nothing but a dark city full of smog, fire, and billboards (eyes and screens are recurrent visual motif that come up again and again in this). The first view we are introduced to, the perspective is that of someone whose soul contains nothing, but a reflection of the world around them.Deckard is a little annoyed that he has to come out of retirement, but what are you gonna do, 'your not us, your little people' as his boss tells him. Only the replicants ask human questions and are driven by human desires like who am I, why do I exist, how can I escape death. For PKD and Ridley Scott, it would seem, these are the fundamental questions which all sentient beings must ask themselves, in order to become human. Without which we lose what makes us any more than biological furniture. 'More human than human is our motto', as the good doctor says about his clone factory.Deckard and the rest of the future, is trapped in a constant darkness where the sun never comes up and the only light comes from giant advertisements, that absorb the landscape into themselves. People scurry about like ants (unconcerned or unaware of the world around them), and even Deckard who has the benefit of not being 'little people' spends his time, like a burn out film noir detective, in a dim apartment, killing time.The Replicants have become more human than the human beings. They like Deckard used to kill for a living, but abandoned that for the possibility of something more, which he has not. Their actions are driven by a need to live as something more than an object and body. Theirs is an existential ordeal, in a world of economic determinism. Their actions though possibly futile are still authentic, they are their actions, and no one else's. Hauer killing off his creator, is a little like Don Quixote fighting off his windmills, an absurd waste of energy, though it's Hauer's awareness and Quixote's lack there of, which defines them as a character, and human beings.We assume that since Harrison Ford is the lead we are supposed to empathize with him, which I imagine is where all the irrelevant conjecture about him being a replicant comes from. It doesn't matter if he is or isn't, because the real criterion for humanity is not birthright, but performance. It's only through meeting the scientists assistant who doesn't know she is a replicant, is he faced with doing something that violates his 'social programming'. By the end it's implied, that he will save the woman, risking himself for someone who will only live four or five years anyway.He has recognized not just that Hauer or those he killed were real thinking people like himself, but that they in fact were better than him, closer in classic terms to being authentic people('the unexamined life is not worth living'etc), because at least they know they are fake, and chose to struggle anyway. Only when faced with artificial reproductions of ourselves (be it robots, stories, paintings, photos, movies, sculpture, etc), do we get a reflection of what is to be human.Or as one of my favorites PKD quotes, says in other words 'So we and our elaborately evolving computers may meet each other halfway. Someday a human being, named perhaps Fred White, may shoot a robot named Pete Something-or-other, which has come out of a General Electric factory, and to his surprise see it weep and bleed. And the dying robot may shoot back and, to its surprise, see a wisp of gray smoke arise from the electric pump that it supposed was Mr. White's beating heart. It would be rather a great moment of truth for both of them.' So not exactly an 'I, Robot' film about robo-equal rights, or a Matrix cautionary 'the machines will get us' story. Instead Ridley Scott shows us a world where human beings are less than machines, more privileged, colder, less aware, and without compassion, and does so in a visual landscape unlike anything movies had seen before",9,0,1,28 April 2009
Beowulf," The 3-d Glasses were a nice touch
","Mixed feelings, see it in Imax and 3d if you must, the experience of watching a 3d movie kinda wanes after the first 30 minutes or so but picks up again the last 20. I thought the re-telling actually wasn't that bad, it a lot of funnier and more emotionally involving the poem, and it managed to include ideas surrounding the original text as well, the layover of Christianity onto the pagan society whether Beawolf is a story of Jesus, or Revelations or a pagan pseudo-history of a warrior king, in any event it's a boring myth, become one of the better 'fantasy' films of recent memory, though visually it still looks pretty stiff, and I don't see this style as the future of film making, as it didn't really work in Final Fantasy or the Polar Express and it don't work here. Animation might do better to imitate our animated and unphotographable mind, as opposed to our literal world which is captured quite accurately by camera.",Null,0,1,12 December 2007
Ran," A Flood Of Red
","I really liked it, the first ten minutes as with most Kurosawa films was pretty boring but, it really picked up after that. Maybe its because I never read King Lear, and so the story was fresh to me, but I found the plot the dialoge to have some Shakespearean ideas and monologues, and still managed to preserve the action of the story itself. It was a much better adaptation than 'Thrown Of Blood', which aside from the death scene at the end, was pretty dull and unexciting. I liked the montage sequence during the siege the most especially when the music cuts out, and the war sounds shock the movie back to action. 'Chaos', indeed, but it is the classic chaos which we are familiar with, the story since it is derivative, can be repetitive at times, however the sheer visual depth and eye for composition present in every frame makes this a more than worthy viewing experience for anyone.",Null,0,2,12 December 2007
Sin City," The Sins Of Miller
","I liked it a lot, the characters were one dimensional and some of the acting wasn't that great, but that wasn't really the movies main objective. The cinematorgraphy and action were great, and the plots aimed at 'cool', and that's really what it stood on, but did so in a way where I wouldn't mind watching it again and again. The continuous voice overs got a bit annoying at first, but after awhile I slowly warmed the Raymond Chandler voice overs. This film, if nothing else is a great link between the poetry of static visual comics art and film, as well as an homage to all the gritty pulp stories that carried 20th century pop literature like placenta, detective stories, crime stories, film noir, etc. Yes, Frank Miller leans into misogyny and racism like a pirate leans on a peg leg(see 300), but that does not prevent this film from bieng one of the most original and entertaining action films in recent memory. One of the best in this new decade easily.(Being a fan of the books, however, these films really do fail to tell the whole story, the comics are actually much more human and three dimensional, really. Interested parties take note.)",7,0,1,13 December 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," It's Not Really THAT Good...
","Solid, fun, exuberant, vibrant, and over-rated. Good times, but im conflicted about this. Unique setting for a well worn subject, rags to riches, star crossed lovers, betrayal, destiny, etc. Pop culture inspired, music and TV shows which cross cultural boundaries. Novel narrative structure, and use of flashbacks. Its fun, and not every movie is. It's engrossing and over all enjoyable, it will please most, and I was smiling at the end.Its a good pop corn, movie fun, light, you could pop it in on a bad day, and be whisked off. I don't think its fair to say don't nitpick this cus its nice, it is, but its not perfect, and its being hailed as the best thing since sliced bread. Its a great romantic comedy though, and as an exercises in genre, it works well. The torture sequences really weren't as brutal or prolonged as they were being made out to be(not that any torture would be easy).The signature scene is the boy dipped in s&#t, to get his heroes autographs(its referenced at the end too), sometimes you have to suffer, wade through crap, to get what you really want. But the 'it is written' ending was a cop out, a pleasant one, but it is what it is. At the end the tea server, is rich and gets a hot girlfriend, bad guys kill each other, just like 'True Romance'. I'ts romantic and boisterous as a Bollywood song, and depending on your mood, just as cheesy or as colorful.",6,3,9,28 April 2009
High Fidelity," 'It's not what your like, but what You like'
","Picture perfect unsentimental Romantic comedy, about neurosis, growing up, obsession, fetish, fantasy, memory, music, and top 5's. This book takes place in London, but the universal appeal of music makes it's transfer to Chicago seamlessly natural (we...(read more) are all united by pop songs). The characters are deeply flawed, honest, and funny. This is one of best examples of voice over narrative and breaking the fourth wall for direct audience addresses working perfectly, without drawing too much attention to itself. It's excellent, got a great soundtrack, some jokes that are likely to go over a few non music-heads heads, but for the most apart it's a film almost anyone can relate to in some aspect, be it relationships, music, or obsessive listing. But enough has been written and said about this movie, just see it. Good times",10,1,2,12 June 2008
