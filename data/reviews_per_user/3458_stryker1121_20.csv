Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Crazy, courageous, sad, hilarious, wonderfully un-PC
","I've never had a movie experience quite like the one I had with 'Borat.' It may not be as hysterically funny as billed, although it is at times screamingly hilarious, but to me 'Borat' is more disquieting social commentary than straight-out comedy. What a strange, eye-opening film this is. Just go into it with an open mind: As a Jew, it was very weird to hear a theater full of people (and me along with em) laugh at Borat's superstitious dislike of my people. However, it was also strangely liberating to hear Cohen's buffoonish Kazhaki TV reporter's matter-of-fact utterances of nasty Jewish stereotypes that go back centuries. And guess who Borat blames for 9/11? I say 'liberating' b/c people in real life truly believe the Jews are money hungry, have big noses, and we're responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks. What cracked me up (and shocked me a little) about 'Borat' were not the statements themselves as much as a fellow Jew having the stones to say them for the purposes of mainstream cinema. Cynical, smart and unapolgetically offensive, the whole movie is a gut punch, and while plenty of minorities get jabbed in the process, nobody gets a worse beating than the good ole US of A. 'Borat'is an American roadtrip showcasing our casual prejudices.",9,1,6,28 December 2006
Alien 3," Bleak sequel hasn't aged well
","The last time I saw Alien 3 in full and unedited was about 10 years ago. At the time, I considered the sequel to be a dark, brooding, mostly satisfying follow-up to Aliens. I dug the film's bleakness, and while it wasn't as elegant as the first film or as action-packed as the second, I still considered Alien 3 be a fitting (if depressing) end to Ripley's dark journey.I recently read about the studio cut of the film, so I decided to revisit it via Netflix. The longer studio version (not a director's cutas I understand it Fincher had nothing do with it) offers an altered beginning and ending, as well as several extra scenes that flesh out a few secondary characters and fill a few plot holes (like what happened to prisoner Golic). Unfortunately, the longer cut only serves to exacerbate flaws that weren't readily apparent to me upon that first glance a decade ago.(MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD)--It pains me to write this, but Alien 3 is largely an incoherent mess. The first 30 minutes are OK, as we see Ripley mourning the loss of her surrogate daughter and adjusting to her potentially dangerous new environs. Sigourney Weaver is fantastic as she was in the first two films, so no problems there.The plot begins to unravel after the beast's first appearance. The last 90 minutes consist of the alien (only one creature this time, like in the first flick) picking off the prison population, an interchangeable band of bald, white, English guys. Only a few characters stand out, and one of them is inexplicably killed halfway through. The final elongated action scene is particularly wonky, as we get alien POV shots as it chases its victims through the prison complex's dank corridors. After awhile it becomes difficult to tell who's getting eaten and who's not, and frankly, it doesn't really matter, as these characters were so thinly sketched in the first place. And the final-scene cameo of a certain actor from the previous film simply makes no sense.Plot's not the only problem: I remember reading about the various script changes during the long hiatus between Aliens and Alien 3. That instability shows here...particularly towards the end of the film when the dialogue becomes ridiculously vulgar. I'm no prude, far from it, but all the f-bombs seemed forced and unnecessary. Again, Weaver's quite good, but there's only so much she can do with garbage lines like, 'They think we're crud.' Alien 3 isn't a complete waste of time...and it's better than Alien:Resurrection ...the special effects aren't great, but not as bad as some IMDb reviewers contend. The sets and costumes are industrial and gritty, and I still enjoy the movie's overall bleak atmosphere, which at least sets this film apart from its predecessors. However, Alien 3 does not give me the kick that it once did. That makes me a little sad.",Null,314,327,1 August 2007
Star Trek," JJ (almost) does it again
","Full disclosure: I am not a Trekkie.I don't remember much from the original series besides campiness and hammy acting. I have fleeting memories of blue-skinned alien girls in beehive hairdos and spangled eye-shadow; spaceship interiors that looked like Hugh Hefner's den (velour furniture, purple wall sconces); Spock mind-melding with a paper-maché creature that resembled a moldy pizza (that was a weird episode); and red-shirted ensigns being gruffly pronounced 'dead, Jim' by Leonard 'Bones' McCoy.The classic show led to numerous spin-offs, and while I have my nerdish leanings, I'm not a fan of 'hard sci-fi,' a term that sounds pornographic, but unfortunately is not. All it means is the writers of 'Deep Space Nine' and 'The Next Generation' got the theoretical science right when it came to explaining the intricacies of warp drives and particle accelerators. I went to summer school for high-school algebra for Spock's sake, so crazy moon-man talk about quantum physics fried my non-math-understanding synapses.All I wanted out of J.J. Abrams's 'Star Trek' reboot was an intelligent, character-driven sci-fi/ action movie, a scarce multiplex commodity in these dark days of Bay, Ratner and Emmerich.Abrams did not have to march lockstep with the franchise's much obsessed over canon to make me happy, and truly, the red-hot 'Lost' creator does his damndest to make the movie his own while (hopefully) keeping even the crotchetiest Trekkie pleased. The result is an ambitious, well-cast, but ultimately imperfect sci-fi experience.The story smartly twists the origins of the famous USS Enterprise crew. Abrams contrives an alternate 'Trek' universe that uses the series' beginnings as a kind of pushing off point. The result is an all-new film cosmos that recognizes the origin story while remaining free of that story's sticky narrative constraints.Unfortunately, Abrams makes his solid if clichéd time travel/revenge plot less important than the re-introduction of the Enterprise crew. Abrams knows how familiar fans are with these mainstays, and ensures most everyone hits their stock catchphrases and shopworn character moments. Chekhov mis-pronouncing 'V' words with 'W?' It's in there. McCoy grouchily insisting he's a doctor, not a physicist, dammit? That's there, too. Young Kirk hooks up with a blue alien babe, and there's even a 'red-shirt moment' (Ah, Chief Engineer Olson, we hardly knew ye) for particularly nostalgic fans.I understand the necessity of offering such filmic signposts to help re-launch a foundering franchise. However, this new 'Star Trek' has almost too much of a prologue feel.A game cast of virtual unknowns elevates the proceedings, and gives me hope for the inevitable sequel. Chris Pine gets Capt. Kirk's brash arrogance just right without having to do a William Shatner impression, while Zachary Quinto's Spock is all simmering emotion under that placid Vulcan exterior. Karl Urban's McCoy channels a bit too much from DeForest Kelley's original-series performance, but it's still a dead-on imitation. The only cast member who suffers is Eric Bana, whose villainous Romulan ship captain doesn't get enough screen time to be a daunting presence.My tiresome hair-splitting aside, I recognize that 'Star Trek' is in talented hands. From his work on 'Lost,' 'Alias' and the fun monster flick 'Cloverfield,' Abrams has shown he knows how to craft a smart, action-packed product. A meatier plot for the sequel will ensure his new franchise both lives long and prospers.(For more film reviews, visit clevelandsportstorture.blogspot.com)",Null,1,8,6 July 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates 2 rides on Depp's sexually ambiguous shoulders
","Pirates 2 is Johnny Depp's show...his eyeliner wearing, rum-soaked Cap'n Sparrow has fun even when selling out his friends to undead fish people. Depp is truly the most interesting thing about the movie, a bombastic, CGI soaked affair with some impressive special effects and solid action scenes.The biggest problem with Pirates 2 lies with Depp's supporting cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both very pretty, but neither comes close to matching Depp's charisma. Bloom in particular may look good in knickers, but for all his swashbuckling and hero-making, his performance is as bland as dishwater. The film's physically unappealing secondary characters are much more interesting. Pintel and Ragetti are strangely likable, Davy Jones is satisfyingly grotesque, and I found myself weirdly attracted to Tia Dalma.Pirates 2 is very dark for a Disney flickalong with the requisite pirate-y betrayal and (figurative) backstabbing, there's some relatively nasty PG-13 deaths (including throat cuttings and hatchet hackings) and I know if I was six I'd be terrified of Jones and his scaly crew. Older viewers won't be bored by this film, but unless they're huge Depp fans, they won't be that thrilled, either.",Null,0,0,15 February 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Very good, but not great
","This is a sad, complex, sometimes beautiful film with some great performances. However, the last third of Brokeback is hamstrung by Ang Lee's ponderous directing style.In general, I find Lee's films cold and brooding, if not altogether dull. Much of Brokeback Mtn. bucks this trend. Ledger and Gyllenhaal give passionate, inspired performances, although Ledger's is a bit more believable; his eyes convey the weight of his conflict more than Jake G's occasional histrionics. The toll of their forbidden lust, which they mask through marriage and family, is at times excruciating to witness.But during its last 30 minutes, the film undergoes a shift in tone that grinds proceedings to a near halt, and Lee's brooding directing style comes to the fore; it's not like I was expecting a car chase or something in the midst of such serious subject matter, but by the last frame Brokeback becomes inward-looking to the point of coma.",Null,1,10,15 January 2007
Terminator Salvation," Worst entry of the series by far
","McG is the hamfisted directorial version of the Terminatoran unstoppable franchise destroying force who with 'Terminator Salvation' may have managed to kill John Conner without firing a shot.Salvation is a dull, cheerless exercise with not one character I cared about and not one line of dialogue that rang true. The man responsible for 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle' has managed to take all the heart and emotion from James Cameron's efforts (and even the little left over from the mediocre 'T3') and create an arch, clichéd, plot hole ridden, and above all boring Terminator film. How do you make killer robots boring? McG deserves a hearty smack for that inauspicious feat alone.For all its numerous explosions, Salvation feels slight and hollow. Ostensibly good performers such as Christian Bale, Anton Yelchin and Bryce Dallas Howard don't fare well here. Sam Worthington, as a former death row inmate who's the victim of a hideous Skynet experiment, is the only player who has anything interesting to do. However, his character, like everyone else's, is so grossly underwritten that his actions later in the film have zero emotional impact.Bale in particular is a disappointment. He channels his gruff Batman voice to make John Conner an angry, unlikable prick (Ah, the irony). Yelchin does a good Michael Biehn impression, but the circumstances in which his Kyle Reese are placed are ridiculous and cannot be ignored by even the most forgiving, disbelief suspending film fan. Put simply, if Skynet knows Reese is the father of the man leading the resistance, why not just kill him straightaway instead of capturing him? This question is never answered, and the lack of explanation is just one facet of the lazy film-making on display. Another issue is one that plagues many wannabe apocalypse films, at least those made by untalented hacks. That is, while these people have been fighting for the existence of humanity for 15 years, many of them still look like they've stepped out of a Clairol ad. The nuclear holocaust must come with a great dental plan, because most everyone has perfect teeth. A small gripe perhaps, but reflective of the uninspired 'blockbuster' nature of the proceedings.Murderous machines or no, these plucky fighters have also managed to build a high-tech air force and a super cool submarine command center, while helicopters flit through the sky and buzz bomb unsuspecting robo-assassins. Remember that scene from T2 where Skynet's Harrier- like hunter/killer aircraft overpower the resistance's puny jeeps and outdated weaponry and the terminator robots actually seemed menacing? All of that sense of menace and danger is missing here. Not only do the good guys have awesome weapons, they also possess communications technology that allows one man to broadcast via radio to freedom fighters all over the country, if not the world. The horrifying, hardscrabble future portended in the first two Terminator movies is not so bleak after all, it seems.The future of the Terminator series is cloudy, although McG has said he wants to make T5, and the end of Salvation certainly leaves things open for another sequel or two. My hope is that Cameron, finally finished with 'Avatar,' brings his storytelling vision back to the franchise, while McG goes back to making music videos.",Null,15,27,14 December 2009
Spider-Man 3," Emo Spidey and the Three Villains
","The first real misstep in Sam Raimi's heretofore superb Spiderman franchise. SM3 suffers from an affliction that plagues many action sequelsthe misguided necessity to make each successive movie bigger and louder. Apparently using this logic, Raimi shoehorns three bad guys into a messy plot filled with lame contrivances and thinly sketched characterizations. Sandman and Venom don't get the screen-time needed to make them affective or interesting enemies. The two baddies join forces near the end of the film in a scene so superfluous I had to laugh. James Franco is the only one who stands out among the black hatters. He's excellent as the tormented new Goblin. I would have loved to see the entire film built solely around his and Peter's crumbling relationship. There's plenty of speechifying and sappiness in SM3. Poor Peter and even Goblin, Jr. get their ear bent a few times. There's a lot of crying as well, but all this emotion and drama falls very flat, unlike the first two films which largely managed to avoid the maudlin and obvious. Peter's transformation after he's infected by the evil outer space gunk is also handled curiously. How can you tell Peter's 'bad?' Well, he leers at women on the street, wears his bangs over his eyes, and makes the landlord's cute daughter bake him cookies. Ooh, how dark and edgy! Oh yeah, and evil Spidey dances, too. Gave me chills, man.",Null,0,1,24 December 2007
Cloverfield," Yes, it lives up to the hype
","The marketing buzz around the monster-takes-Manhattan movie 'Cloverfield' has been compared to that of 'The Blair Witch Project.' The movies are similar in some ways, both on screen and off: In both flicks no-name actors run for their lives under the eye of a shaky hand-held camera. In each case the footage is supposed to be a tape 'found' by authorities in the aftermath of some horrific event.Off-screen both movies received tons of hype under the guise of a 'media blackout.' I remember some dopey 'Blair Witch documentary' where locals in the town of Scaryville or wherever the fake footage was 'found' were filmed drawling, 'Ayuh, I heard tell of the Blair Witch' while eerie music played in the background. For 'Cloverfield,' the marketing blitz was of the viral variety, as film fans trying to find out about the movie ended up at a series of fake websites set up containing cryptic clues to other websites.'Blair Witch' was an enormous box office smash. It was also a pile of dogcrap in this reviewer's humble opinion. I don't know if 'Cloverfield' will find the same success as 'Blair Witch.' But I can tell you now that it's the better movie by leaps and bounds.Of course, 'Cloverfield,' produced by 'Lost' creator J.J. Abrams, is a much more ambitious undertaking, using all of Manhattan as a playground of destruction. It starts off in a posh loft where a going away party is being held for (I think his name is) Rob, who is leaving for Japan (the cinematic birthplace of the city-smashing giant monster) for a job. The party is being 'documented' with a hand-held video camera by Rob's best friend, Hud. The shindig is disrupted by what partygoers think is an earthquake. (It ain't) Then the real fun starts.And 'Cloverfield is a good time. It's pretty intense, and at times quite comical. The film strives to be 'a monster movie for the YouTube generation,' as its director states. In that account 'Cloverfield' mostly succeeds, but it does help to suspend your disbelief a bit. For example, why does our amateur documentarian continue to lug around that camera while the city crumbles? 'People are gonna want to see this,' he says by way of explanation. I can live with that. In this shrinking Web 2.0 world, where you can access public video sharing websites and watch Saddam Hussein get executed, it's no surprise someone wants to record the end of all things.Believe the hype boys and girls. 'Cloverfield' is an exciting ride all the way through.",Null,186,355,17 January 2008
21," Try your luck elsewhere
","The true story of six MIT kids who try to fleece Vegas is embellished to say the least in '21.' There's lots of added drama, a heap of unintentional campiness, plot twists you can see coming down the Strip, and a love story thrown in for the hell of it. This flick was made for the MTV set...the mechanics of how these kids actually count cards to beat the system is explained quickly but not well. I'm probably an idiot (and I haven't read the book upon which the movie is based) but I still don't get it. This movie makes the 'how' not really matter anyway. Why explain boring old math when you can have montages of our ethnically diverse group of spoiled geniuses bar hopping and shopping at Louis Vuitton? If you've seen the trailers than you know 21...there are no surprises here. There is a long running time that makes the last 30 minutes of the film agonizing. There's a few ham-fisted plot twists and double crosses and I kept expecting the movie to end...then WHAM, another scene of our lead character back at the tables in a cheesy disguise and more slow motion shots of the dealer flipping cards.Sturgess is barely passable as Ben...he doesn't quite have the magnetism to pull off the various emotional shadings required of the role. There are parts where he underplays emotion and parts where he overplays them...he never really finds a medium. '21' would have been great ten years ago; give me Giovanni Ribisi in the Ben role and you have something cooking. But Sturgess is pretty blah...so is Kate Bosworth, who looks a lot like Priscilla Presley and nothing like a college student. The only two actors worth a damn here are Spacey, the acerbic ringleader of the young card counters, and the underused Jacob Pitts, who helps recruit Ben into the group.21 does well to show the all-night-long decadence of Vegas, and there are some beautiful shots of the Strip at night. Otherwise the flick is by-the-numbers garbage.",Null,16,20,12 April 2008
Wanted," Rubbish...that's all I have to say about that
","Wanted is a dull exercise in guns, blood, ridiculous vehicular stunts, and mediocre CGI. I appreciate the film's unapologetic, in-your-face attitude, but the experience is overwhelmingly generic. There's your usual bullet-bending, Matrix-style action hackishly combined with a story about a nebbishy CPA who discovers he's the son of an assassin.McAvoy is unremarkable in the lead role...I actually found him quite grating and unlikeable and never really believed he was some badass killer. There's some star power here as well w/ Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie's lips...they are adequate but not really given much to work with. And anyway, the actors take a backseat to the bloody action and mayhem, which I've seen done better in some of the ultraviolent Asian action flicks this movie is so obviously trying to emulate.Stay away from Wanted, filmgoing public. Stay away!",1,4,9,31 January 2009
Aliens," Intense, jaw-dropping, brilliant 'analog' action flick
","Many times replicated, never equaled, Aliens is the best action movie of all time. There is nothing that even comes very close. It's hard to articulate the effect this film has had on me. It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that doesn't spoil with time and so-called 'maturity.' The first time I saw Aliens was at a friend's house. I was 13 and I was totally blown away. I'm now 31 and Aliens still rocks my world. Where Alien is stark and slinking and great in its own way, the sequel is bombastic and balls-to-the-wall.So many scenes stand out. I'll never forget my initial viewing of the terrifying, kick-ass sequence where the creatures first attack the Space Marines ('They're all around us man!') However, the brilliance of this film lies in the fact that the 'quiet' scenes are as powerful as the action-packed ones: The hint of romance as Hicks demonstrates his assault rifle to Ripley; the look of despair on Ripley's face when she's told there are families colonizing the planet.I will always love Weaver for her achingly intense performance here. I've never seen another like it in the genre. The supporting cast is wonderful, as well. Standouts include Biehn (also awesome in Terminator), Henricksen, Reiser and of course Bill Paxton, who practically steals the show.You look at sci-fi/action flicks today, and most of em are soulless exercises in CGI. Cameron's models and costumed monsters are much more effective than anything George Lucas tried in the Star Wars prequels.",Null,4,6,8 August 2006
Batman Begins," Disappointing
","Batman needed an infusion of new blood after Joel Schumacher turned the franchise into a candy-colored nightmare in the '90s. 'Batman & Robin' is likely the worst superhero movie in cinematic history. I wanted to like 'Batman Begins,' and it certainly arrived with an impressive pedigree. Nolan's 'Memento' was dark and intriguing. Bale was impressively nasty in 'American Psycho.' So what happened? Why was BB such a bore?. I'm all for a 'darker' Batman, but where 'Batman and Robin' was campy and stupid 'Batman Begins' is plodding and pretentious. It took itself way too seriously. There were some cool individual scenesBatman stalking bad guys in the shipping yard, Bale facing (and embracing) his fear of bats in the soon-to-be Batcavebut the last half hour was one long action set piece we've seen 100 times before. Bale's Bruce Wayne/Batman has zero charisma, which came as a surprise coming from such an impressive actor. And what was with that gravelly voice Bale used while in costume? I know Wayne's trying to protect his identity, but it just sounded goofy to me. The worst casting choice was Katie Holmes. First, she looks 17, and second, she doesn't have the gravitas to pull off this role. If she's an assistant DA than they might as well have cast Pauly Shore as Batman.",Null,1,2,7 September 2007
I Am Legend," Hollywood ending
","Try to conjure Manhattan as a ghost town; a vast, lonely chasm. Streets once teeming with people are now gridlocked by rusting vehicles and overrun by wild deer. Dusty skyscrapers lean toward the street like drunks, their broken windows leering like blinded eyes. There's no sound but the wind whistling through the spaces between these abandoned buildingsat least until it gets dark. Another sound grows as the sun disappearsan inhuman shriekingScary, no?Such is the post-apocalyptic backdrop of 'I Am Legend,' the fascinating, ultimately frustrating story of a man who believes he may very well be the last person on earth, although he desperately hopes otherwise. Will Smith plays Neville, an army scientist holed up in his fortress-like home searching to cure the plague that killed off most of the world's population and turned everyone else into somethingunpleasant. The story begins 3 years after the apocalypse; Neville hasn't had any human contact in that time, and his only companion is his dog. The first two-thirds of the film are all Smith's. He is excellentperhaps the best he's ever beenas a man driven half-crazy by loneliness amid a decaying city. His life is driven by desperation and terror and a drive to 'fix' a situation beyond his control. Pretty heavy stuffat least until the filmmakers lose their nuts and add an element unfound in Richard Matheson's ultra-bleak novel. This was a Christmas-time 'tentpole' for Warner Bros. after all, so no downer endings here. We do get some pablum about faith and belief that have nothing to do with the brooding meal that was served over the previous 90 minutes. Too bad, because 'I Am Legend' should have been a sci-fi classic; the watered down ending makes it a good film, but not the great one it could have been.",Null,2,4,14 April 2008
Zombieland," American 'Shaun' doesn't work
","'Zombieland' can't help but stand in bloody parallel to another horror-comedy road movie about two unlikely survivors of the undead apocalypse. Both 'Zombieland' and 'Shaun of the Dead,' the former's ostensible overseas cinematic twin, are unapologetically crass, viscera-strewn studies of two lovable losers who must make their way in a terrifyingly changed world.This rough plot sketch is where the similarities between the two films end. 'Zombieland' replaces 'Shaun's' charmingly English wit and creativity with an attempted skewering of American hubris and excess. The resulting effort is oddly flat in tone and surprisingly unfunny in execution.There's just something missing in the relationship between 'Columbus' and 'Tallahassee,' the heroes of the piece. The two wanderers, who go by their cities of origin instead of real names, meet on a vehicle-snarled highway in an unspecified time well into the zombie apocalypse. They are a predictably unalike duo—Columbus is a virginal nebbish whose obsessive-compulsive personality has kept him alive, while Tallahassee is more of a seat-of-his-pants free spirit with a penchant for fast cars, fast food and heavy weaponry.Eisenberg and Harrelson are game enough in their respective roles, but their on screen chemistry is just not in evidence. Eisenberg's twitchy awkwardness is amusing, although he will draw inevitable and not unfair comparisons to the silver screen's current Mayor of Awkwardtown , Michael Cera. Eisenberg's snakeskin suit-wearing counterpart, meanwhile, oozes Southern charisma and is not afraid to chew the scenery. However, the two actors are not funny together, and are largely relegated to Eisenberg reacting nervously to Harrelson's deftly delivered put-downs.The pair is also saddled with some contrived, 'only-in-a-movie' character traits. Harrelson's Twinkie obsession struck me as pointless and should not have been a driving force behind the narrative. Eisenberg's phobias feel similarly phony, especially has terror of clowns. What are the odds our boy overcomes his fear and kills a zombie clown during a pivotal point in the movie? What do you think? These plot devices feel forced, as does a particular catchphrase director Ruben Fleischer drops three separate times with the apparent hope of some kind of future cult recognition. Go to any frat party in the next few years and you may hear drunken rabble-rousers advising their buddies to 'nut up or shut up' before doing a keg stand. F*** You very much for that Mr. Fleischer.Emma Stone as con artist cutiepie 'Wichita' injects some life into the proceedings, but not enough. The film really starts to flail during a weird, extended cameo by a certain comic actor. Hey, I like the actor in question, and the director obviously loves him, because he gives the guy ten minutes of screen time and heavily references several of his most popular works. It's just a strange meta moment that took me entirely out of the experience, for whatever it was worth up to that point.Sadly, not much really works in 'Zombieland.' There are a few fun scenes here and there, and I enjoyed the clever deployment of 'Columbus's' strict rules for survival in zombie hell. Sadly, those bits are scattered like shotgunned zombie brains against a gas station wall. I think I'll just go watch 'Shaun of the Dead' again.",Null,0,1,15 February 2010

But as the film wears on and the body count piles up, the twisty plot becomes formulaic and predictable and the Southie accents ('fahk you ya queeah!' is a common turn of phrase for example) start to grate on the viewer's (well, this viewer's) nerves.

The Wrestler," Aronofsky, Rourke serve a brooding meal that's not for everyone
","The Wrestler is a hard movie to watch. A patina of doom and desperation shellacs every scene in this story about washed out, sad eyed professional wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. This is no uplifting Rocky-like tale. Nor does it follow the rise-fall-redemption template of the recent spate of musician biopics. The Wrestler is about a man who's hit bottom only to discover there's nowhere else to go but down. Watching that negative trajectory play out on screen is an exceedingly uncomfortable experience. Part of that discomfort stems from Darren Aronofsky's directing style. Several scenes resemble a documentary with a hand-held camera shakily following a shambling Mickey Rourke around the New Jersey hinterlands as he readies himself for a match. The bouts are held not in the packed arenas of The Ram's 1980s heyday, but in the bingo halls and high school gyms of the low-paying indie circuit. The wrestling action is intimately filmed; the camera tightens around the two performers as they wince from the real pain of pulled punches and chairs to the head. An ECW-style hardcore match is especially difficult to watch. Here, Aronofsky unflinchingly shoots The Ram and his opponent brutalizing each other with lamps, thumbtacks and barbed wire. He then shows us the cringe-inducing backstage aftermath of medics removing glass shards from the combatants' scarred, blood-covered bodies. The latter is something you will not see during the average episode of Monday Night Raw. What's especially sad is that The Ram takes these beatings for essentially chump change, and must rely on a concoction of prescription pain medications to push him to his next minuscule payday. Memories of past glories keep him going, as does the reverence of younger wrestlers and the adoration from the rabidly vocal group of fans who attend his small-scale shows. Ultimately, however, he keeps wrestling because there's nothing else he knows how to do. The punishment Aronofsky heaps upon The Ram is not just physical. The former star lives at the poverty level in a trailer pathetically decorated with newspaper clippings of his heroic past. His relationships with other people, meanwhile, are tangential at best: During the week he works at a grocery store, where his mean-spirited jerk of a boss humiliates him with cheap jokes. He spends much of his money on a hot-but-aging stripper, played by the still very gorgeous Marisa Tomei. Nor does he have a relationship with his teenage daughter, whom he deserted long ago. All of this adds up to a lonely, beaten-down existence with little hope for something better. This sad circumstance is wholly embodied by Mickey Rourke, whose own demons have been well-publicized in the months leading up to 'The Wrestler's' release. Simply put, this movie wouldn't work without Rourke's pained presence. His straggly, peroxide-blond hair and craggy moonscape of a face are disturbing wonders to behold. Physical and psychic pain surround him like some weird dark aura. It is hard to separate the character from the man, a fact that only strengthens the gravity of Rourke's performance. Rourke's work makes it easier to overlook the cliché-ridden elements of the narrative: The machinations of The Ram's attempt and ultimate failure to reconnect with his long-lost daughter, for example, are trite and predictable. Tomei is solid as the stripper-mom with a heart of gold, but there's very little chemistry between her and Rourke, making her actions toward the end of the movie rather unbelievable. All that said it is morbidly fascinating to watch Rourke's take on a man of a bygone decade where people listened to Ratt without irony and considered pro wrestling a legitimate sport.I also admire Aronofsky for not bailing viewers out with an easy-to-digest message or feel- good resolution. His grim vision scarcely gives viewers a chance to breathe.",Null,0,0,27 January 2009
Casino Royale," 'Royale' without cheese
","The moribund Bond series gets a much needed shot in the gut thanks to Daniel Craig. Gone are the bland pretty boys with their tepid sexual innuendos and corny one-liners. Craig brings a nasty and cold-blooded jolt to the usual tux-and-martini shenanigans, officially resuscitating the corpse that was cinema's longest-running franchise.Craig's steely intensity brings weight to a typically thin Bond plot. Following a brilliant chase scene, the film is slowed by several prolonged card-playing segments that bloat the proceedings to an overlong 144 minutes. What's more, the movie's convoluted finale is rather predictable and unsatisfying.However, thanks to Craig's stirring 007 turn, these flaws can be somewhat forgiven. Thankfully, the new Bond isn't the same as the old Bond.",Null,0,5,30 April 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Fun but forgettable action sequel
","Live Free or Die Hard is pure action movie fluff, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's not much of a good thing either. After all these years the franchise feels a bit played out and generic. High-tech gadgets, over-the-top stunt sequences, CGI cars flipping around like tiddly-winks, henchmen dying elaborate deaths--some of this stuff is pretty cool, but none of it is terribly original. Action fans have witnessed these same scenes innumerable times since the first Die Hard kicked out collective asses with its genre-bending awesomeness. Unfortunately, the genre is watered down to the point where this fourth iteration is indiscernible from the hundreds of films that copied and expanded the first Die Hard's template.LFoDH is not terrible by any means...Willis is still cool at 52 and Justin Long makes for an amusingly snarky sidekick. It's just that the movie feels strangely 'safe.' The action sequences are fun but you probably won't remember much about them once you leave the theater. The lead villain is a bit bland as is his plot to disrupt America through cyber-f@ckery. The strongest epithet our profane hero gets to use is 'jerk-off.' And as for McClane's famously vulgar catchphrase? Forget about it, cuz this is the land of PG-13.By the end, there's no defining moment that separates this film from others of its kind. That's more a reflection of a dying genre than a bad movie. We've seen it all before.",Null,0,3,5 July 2007
300," Comical
","Do you like to watch thickly muscled beefcake slicing swarthy enemies to ribbons under a copper colored sky? Then '300' is for you. Otherwise, stay far away from this cornball pseudo-epic that falls flat in nearly every facet.This is a flick that takes itself way too seriously while shamelessly borrowing from superior movies; among them 'Braveheart' and 'Lord of the Rings.' From the opening scene viewers are besieged with hollow speechifying and colloquial dialogue. Forget about any history lesson, '300' is all about the spectacle of slow motion CGI bloodletting, makeup effects, and the fine art of facial piercing.Cardboard characters predominate the green-screen, er,landscape...plot twists are as subtle as a spear to the gut. It's hard to care about these Spartan warmongerers when there is nothing to a well-toned deltoid interesting about them. Meanwhile, the evil 'god king' Xerxes wears purple lipstick and is about as threatening as Prince during his 'Purple Rain' era. (Great album, though. Listen to that instead of watching this.) Yes, there are a couple of cool fight scenes. The best early on when the Spartans literally push a horde of enemies into the sea. However, any political subtext, i.e. 'freedom isn't free,' is lost in the rest of this silly excuse for a war epic.",Null,0,1,6 July 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Enjoyable if you're a fan of the show
","It seems late in the day for a Simpsons movie. The show can still be counted on for some hit-or-miss laughs, but obviously it's not as good as it was during its heyday a decade and more ago. The movie is a reflection of the current state of the show. For longtime fans, there's certainly some chuckles to be had. But there's not a lot of belly laughs to be had, and for that I was a bit disappointed, if not surprised.I found myself smiling nostalgically more than laughing throughout the 90 minute running time. There's some good sight gags and various amusing Homer-related moments. I didn't even mind Groening and Co. taking the family out Springfield. However, the biting satire which separates the Simpsons from the Family Guys of the world is not quite as sharp as I'd like. Again, this sad fact mirrors the Simpsons recent small screen efforts, but I wanted to love this movie and I did not. It's fun, it's enjoyable, its The Simpsons, just don't go expecting 'Homer Goes to College'-era hilarity from our favorite cartoon family's first movie.",Null,0,3,5 August 2007
