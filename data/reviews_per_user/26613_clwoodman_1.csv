The Benchwarmers," Terrible
","I am not a huge fan of this sort of comedy, admittedly, but I watch quite a few as the parent of 4 teenage boys. I usually rate them in the category of 'kept me occupied, didn't hate it, wouldn't watch it again' rather than as memorable, or works of comedic genius. For example, I found Wayne's World, Dodgeball, and most Adam Sandler movies to be very reasonable to watch, but thought Kicking and Screaming was not entertaining. This film was much worse than that. The characters are not appealing and not funny. I couldn't sympathize with any of them, nor could I laugh at them or with them. The gags are old and not well executed. The movie failed on every level for me. Junior high boys would find it entertaining, everyone else should rent something else.",1,7,13,7 August 2006
