The Blair Witch Project," Horribly hyped up movie that was rather boring
","When going to see the Blair Witch Project, I expected to see an extremely good and scary movie.  I was forced to travel forty-five minutes to see the film at the only theater that was showing it in my area.  Furthermore, because the showings were selling out so quickly, we had to purchase tickets online for $9.50 each.  Keeping these aspects in mind, the film was not worth the effort one bit.  All that I kept hearing from the media was how truly scary it was.  It wasn't scary at all.  First, it was filmed on really shaky Hi-8mm video camera, which made nearly everyone in the theater motion-sick, then after nearly an hour into the film, almost nothing had happened.  This movie moved so slowly, and then the ending was abrupt, not scary, and lame.  This film is not worth the effort, and doesn't come close to the hype.",1,1,4,18 July 1999
Final Destination," WORST MOVIE, EVER!
","This movie by far is one of the biggest marketing mistakes ever!  When this movie first came out, as most of you remember, it was billed as a smart psychological thriller.  It wasn't anything close to that.  Final Destination was a cheap thrill fest.  All show, with nothing going on upstairs.  The marketing people behind the publicity of this movie knew that, and they fooled me into seeing this work of garbage.  I've been cheated.",1,4,9,1 May 2000
