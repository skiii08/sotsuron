The Hangover," Honest Review by Divyam Saran
","In the first part, before Doug gets married, Philip, Stu, Alan & Doug travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor's party. However, on the very next morning, none of them have any memory of the last night and they must find Doug before the wedding can take place. It is the best part of the whole series. It is engaging to see their excursion all through Las Vegas, their experience with various individuals, some exceptionally odd as well and the peak, regardless of whether they can discover Doug or not is fascinating. The film is loaded with funniness and holds your breath. Music, direction, and screenplay are excellent. It's nice to have a virtual tour of Las Vegas and you might also wish to hang up with your friends thereafter watching this movie.",9,1,2,1 April 2020
Ted," Ted both parts review by Divyam Saran.
","All things considered, a few motion pictures are with the end goal that they are adored by crowds of each age gathering. The film about which I am going to discuss today falls under that class, Ted and Ted 2.
The film rotates around John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) who during his youth days, on the event of Christmas Eve wanted that his teddy springs up and it works out as expected. This film at that point manages the further existence of John as a grown-up, how Ted turns into a necessary piece of his life and how he influences his own life.
This film, as I would see it, doesn't exhaust you and holds you till the end. It is pressed with amusement, sentiment, and some exciting activity as well. Although there are some scenes unsuitable for children, for example, when John and Ted smoke together or there might be some private minutes among Ted and his sweetheart, which gives this film an 'A' rating yet at the same time I see this film as extremely engaging.
The initial segment, Ted (2012), rotates around the life of John Bennett, his relationship with Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) and how Ted unfavourably influences their relationship.
The subsequent part, Ted (2015), managed the life of Ted and his relationship with his better half Lynn (Jessica Barth). Right now, the film, Ted likewise faces a personality emergency as the American Government will not consider Ted as a typical individual.
Seth MacFarlane has offered a voice to Ted and has likewise coordinated the establishment. His course is excellent remembering that it is his presentation directorial adventure. The screenplay and the story were additionally generally excellent.
And if I say something about dialogues then they are very well written. Be it be dialogues of Ted too and the dialogue delivery is also really very entertaining and impressive.
This was not the first occasion when I saw a film of Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis cooperating. Separately just as together this pair unquestionably functions admirably. I prior saw them in the film Max Payne (2008), where Mark assumes the title job and Mila assumes the job of Mona Sax. I truly regard these individuals as entertainers a great deal.
Seeing a delicate toy come into life is a different encounter for me and I imagine that it would engage all of you as well. Although the film has become very old I think it has not lost its engaging variable.
There are many things which we can learn from every movie and that is the case here too but I would state only one thing which I found out to be the most important. It is based on the priorities set by an individual in his or her life. Priorities are dynamic; they never remain fixed. John should have realized the same point. He should have felt that since he is in his 30s or 40s, Ted should not be his prime priority now. I know Ted is his best friend and they are so-called 'thunder buddies' of each other but they can maintain it but now through a certain distance. He did not realize so which adversely affected his relationship with his girlfriend, Lori Collins and which (though temporarily) spoilt his relationship with Ted, but that's not always the case in real life. Relations in today's world are very tender and need to be taken care of and for that right steps and the right time needs to be taken place to maintain every relation and lead a balanced life.
By and large, these two movies, as I would like to think, merit watching work.",9,1,3,28 March 2020
The Hangover Part II," Honest review by Divyam Saran
","In part two, the four friends 'the wolfpack' travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding. But things take a roll towards the previous chapter and this time Stu's future brother in law goes missing. This film is also very entertaining and I hope you will enjoy their second hangover ( I wouldn't reveal the destination). The film is equally good and well made. I find no discrepancies from the side of filmmakers, but still, you will enjoy the first part more as the same theme is being re-used here and you know that if the theme is re-used each time successively then it loses its very own essence and the perceived satisfaction decreases. But still, I give a big thumbs up to this film too.",9,1,2,1 April 2020
The Hangover Part III," Movie review by Divyam Saran
","The third and final part of the trilogy revolves around Alan, who after the untimely demise of his father decides to change his ways and start living with some new standards to renovate his life. But all things don't go as planned and the four again land into trouble when Chow's enemies abduct Doug. This film too is very entertaining but what I found is that it lost its very own essence of the hangover. In the film, you see only Chow enjoying the hangover, while the four are always in trouble. The film is very humourous and good comedy too but still I would highly recommend the previous parts over this especially the first one. But still, I would give this film a positive rating.",8,1,2,1 April 2020
