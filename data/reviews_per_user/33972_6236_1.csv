Requiem for a Dream," Addiction
","This movie rocked me. I have been sober and clean for 20 years.My addictions also include sugar. Movies are one of my hobbies and I don't recall a film other than this that showed hard drugs and sugar addiction ( Mrs. Goldfarb) as both dangerously progressive.This may sound judgemental but I believe it is rare for anyone not anaddict to understand the insanity  of addiction. There may also be people who see this movie who are denying their own addiction.The requiem (death) of dreams is what the using addict experiences daily.Also, I compliment the director in showing Mrs. Goldfarb in withdrawal pain from sugar (before she got her diet pills) as very similar to drug and alchohol addiction. I've experienced that.Did you notice her relationship to the box of chocolates?A Food Addict (processed foods like sugar, etc.) when 'using' can be every bit as crazy as other addicts.I have some years abstaining from sugar products also as a member of Food Addicts Anonymous. My heart went out to all the addicts in this film who killed their dreams with their drug.Thankyou for giving my comments consideration.JJ",Null,0,1,5 December 2003
