The Blair Witch Project," If only ...
","If only the ruse could have been kept up a little longer. If you haven't yet seen this film or heard anything about it (yeah, like that's possible), stop reading immediately and go see it. This was a great idea with amazing execution, and if I hadn't been told (by some idiot who will pay) that it's not a true story, I would say that it's the scariest film I've ever seen. Even with that knowledge, it was close.I tried very hard to avoid all the preceding hype, and was almost successful, having seen no more than a print ad with the now-famous come-on (see above). The pains that were taken to make this amazing film seem real, along with the flawless performances by the actors, sucked me in like nothing else I have experienced. In a perfect world, everyone would see this movie the way its creators intended, with none of us knowing that it wasn't found footage. As I said, I had already been told, and I still spent the entire second half squirming with fear.If you're looking for one of the gore-flicks that pass for horror films these days, this ain't it. But if you want a unique cinematic experience that is nothing short of harrowing, see this movie. It's just too bad they couldn't keep the secret.",10,1,2,4 August 1999
