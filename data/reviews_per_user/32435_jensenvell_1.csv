Blade Runner 2049," Review
","Blade runner, although it has an intricate plot and a high level of science fiction, was extremely inappropriate. With scenes with random nudity, this movie was set in a post apocalyptic world where sex was desensitized in society. As a result, the movie had cringe-worthy scenes that were highly inappropriate and overly and unnecessarily exaggerated. I would not recommend, and I am ashamed by the suggestive content. Although the plot was interesting, I regret watching this movie, and I recommend you to stay away.",Null,1,3,6 December 2017
