Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Damn boring!!!
","I just can't understand why this below the average movie is so overrated! It's definitely Tarantino's worst, its missable one by far! Basically nothing happens in the whole movie. The plot is really inexistent. You could summarize it in a couple of lines and it wouldn't be a synthesis, but just a faithful report of what happens on screen! The first hour is just damn boring! I've never yawned so much at a movie since Matrix 2! The only entertaining part is Daryl Hannah's fight vs The Bride and that's not much! Direction is great, as you would expect from Quentin, but there are so many homages to other movies and styles that you start asking yourself what's the real Tarantino contribution going on here! Acting is absolutely fantastic and Uma Thurman is quite simply majestic. But that's just not enough to build up a decent movie! Quentin, give us back Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown and stop doing this Matrix2-style(ish) crap!",5,4,7,10 October 2004
