Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat - the benefit of all cultural learning's
","This is an interesting and comic movie. More interesting is the fact that the beginning of the film is filmed in Romania. I am Rumanian and I know how the Rumanian language sounds. And this is a big mistake. But this is not all The beginning of the movie it is filmed in Romania in a gypsy village. And the majority of the people filmed there are gypsies. I am asking my self: how long is this going to be that way? Rumanians = Russians = Gypsies = god know what. Perhaps tomorrow I will find out that Romania is somewhere in Africa or that the Taliban's speak Rumanian or maybe the Klingon's will speak that language. In the majority of the American movies Romania is a 'destroyed by war country', ugly places, stupid people, gypsy people, vampire people, Dracula  - but this is too much.What more is to be said? Good movie actually and nice acting. It looks like a documentary film but it is funny enough to laugh until your mouth will form a single line from one ear to another. Just joking or not I will not tell you what you will see in the movie because you will be surprised. And you will go and see it because is an elegant and attractive movie, if a can say like that. P.S.: Sorry for my bad English, we are what others make as to be Some kind of Yoda's from Star Wars",8,2,5,29 November 2006
