The Blair Witch Project," interesting.
","The Blair Witch Project (1999) is a movie that ultimately changed films that followed. It is about 3 students who embark on an adventure searching for the 'Blair Witch'. On their journey, they manage to get lost, leading to questionable events, leaving the audience biting their nails. Throughout the whole film, there are no actual jump scares or gruesome scenes which leads me to believe that this film was meant to built suspense. When following these students on their journey, the audience watches them struggle and sees them reach the point of insanity. In the end of the movie, Mike is facing a corner because earlier in the film they interviewed local civilians and one mentioned that the 'Blair Witch' puts one person facing a corner while it kills the other. This means that the witch had put Mike in the corner and was in the middle of killing Josh, when the camera was knocked to the floor leaving the ending open for debate. I found this movie to be neither the best or over hyped. The movie's idea behind creating a realistic feeling to the footage and having the characters filming was amazing and was the first of its time. All the hype around the movie is well deserved as it was entertaining throughout the whole movie. After the filming ends, the audience is left in the air with all sorts of theories of what happens to the students. There is no definite answer of what happens after which is why this movie has managed to entertain people nearly 20 years after being released. I would definitely recommend this movie to others as it is a great way to break the ice and start a discussion.",7,0,0,2 November 2017
The Shining," pretty cool
","The Shining changed the movie industry and influenced many horror films to follow. Although it is listed in the horror genre, it stands out from all others. Most horror films follow a classic format involving jump scares and gory scenes. The Shining, however, did not reflect that. This film incorporates 'easter eggs' to develop a deeper meanings and parallel story lines, which create horror in it's audiences mind. Nothing in the film was a coincidence or an accident which makes the film even more terrifying. There are so many hidden features that you could watch the film over 100 times and still not have all the pieces. I think this movie is a classic because people today are still talking about theories and know exactly what movie the line 'Here's Johnny!' is from. Personally, I think this movie really started the era of layered movies and is one of my favorite horror movies of all time.",9,0,1,7 November 2017
Get Out," Well done.
","'Get Out', written by Jordan Peele, was a roller coaster. It incorporates all of society's flaws involving the black lives matter movement. I felt that Jordan did a great job projecting this concept to it's audience, through a various number of symbolism. The acting performance of Daniel Kaluuya was spectacular. The plot line was easy to follow and I felt it conveyed an extremely impactful concept. Jordan Peele has created 2 different ending to the movie and after watching both, I would have gone with the alternate ending. In the ending not added to the final product, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) ends up killing Rose and is sent to prison for manslaughter. I feel like this ending would have been more realistic to what goes on in todays society and would have really impacted the audiences feelings. Although the ending where Chris is saved by his friend leaves the movie off on a happy note, I believe that the truth of how the black community are treated should not be censored for it to be resolved. Overall I still deeply enjoyed watching this film and would definitely recommend it to others.",9,14,27,13 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Excellent
","James Franco's creation based on the famous horrible movie called 'The Room' was one of my favorite movies of all time. The humor in the movie perfectly matched mine and was consistent throughout the entire film. A reason why such a poor movie from nearly 15 years ago is still relevant could be due to the long going mystery of it. Tommy Wiseau, director/writer/producer of 'The Room', is still a mystery to this day and no one can determine where he is from our where he got his money from. The great part of the creation of 'The Room' is that he funded and wrote it all himself and based it on his own life events. Personally I feel that Wiseau was an unintentional genius who created a great film to laugh about with friends. The film 'The Disaster Artist' does not necessarily require you to watch 'The Room' but it sure as hell makes you want to. Tommy Wiseau himself told James Franco his take on the behind the scenes was extremely accurate and hearing that statement makes me want to watch 'The Room' even more. I would strongly recommend watching both films to anyone interested in having some laughs.",9,1,2,17 April 2018
