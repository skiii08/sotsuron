The Ring," Loan the 6th Sense !
","As I saw the trailer for the US-remake of the Japanese hit first time, I thought regarding the scenes with David Dorfman: Wow, who is this, Haley? Now, the enthusiasm has been replaced by disappointment.In a mix of Horror, Drama and suspense, they try to follow the tracks of the 6th Sense, but the foot-steps are numbers too great. If you compare: The horror-elements can't shock the visitor. Surprise, an  important ingredient of a thriller, lacks almost total. But this is no surprise, in the eye of a uninspired plot (Female Journalist try to find the origin of a video to safe her life and explores a family tragedy.). This psychological part weaves to be upset and amateurish. A few scenes with Brian Cox are not enough. And when Dorfman whispers about the dead young girl 'She shows me things', then this shakes you some seconds. But in the next moment you thinks of Osment and the possibilities given away. The makers hadn't the 6th sense for the causes of Shyamalans success and overpaced their project. But little would have been more. They should go back to school.Loan the original, this movie isn't worth a cinema trip!",3,0,1,9 March 2003
