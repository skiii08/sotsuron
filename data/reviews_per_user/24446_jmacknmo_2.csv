Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Animal House & Porkies is miles above ....
","I only walked out on one film in my life. This would have been #2 except that my wife couldn't believe there was nothing more after the rave reviews we read. I usually bust a gut at a funny movie, but all I got were a couple of chuckles. People are talking about a second level of humor; I couldn't find the first! The level of 'humor' here is below rock bottom. Animal House & Porkies is miles above the level of 'humor' in this piece of crap. I can't believe I spent $20 for this! That is all I have to say about it, but it seems I have to add more words to get my review on the site. I guess that is the same premise that Borat was working with.",1,18,38,8 November 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," If you have become completely desensitized to extreme blood & guts...
","If you have become completely desensitized to extreme blood & guts and the rape of a comatose woman, this is the film for you. I don`t know what happened after that because I had had enough. It is only the 2nd film I have ever walked out on. This is the WORST piece of CRAP I have seen in years!!! I love martial arts & action films, but this is simply violence for the sake of violence with blood flowing everywhere. This film panders to the lowest levels of our society. With deference to those who saw some artistic value to this film, do more blood & guts make a better movie? Apparently it does for many. But how far can it go??? Is there ever a limit?",1,9,19,8 November 2003
