It," Impressed
","I watched this movie right on the day of its release. When I saw a monster clown haunting a group of kids I was like, maybe this is gonna be some childish comedic horror movie. Right from the start, I saw that I underestimated it. Instead of being so childish with some bunch of kids as its main cast, it rather got darker and darker as it progressed. The clown demon was scary as hell and the story line too was impressive. The choice of cast too was okay. It didn't possess outmoded clich√©slike most horror films still use. It was just original with its story line. One thing I love most about this movie is that, unlike most horror films where its all about the main character running about and escaping the villain, this one actually asks the question, What if it is the villain who has to escape the heroes? The characters were brave, for kids their age. I can't wait for book two.",10,1,2,10 November 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," It is a good movie
","This movie was terrific. I enjoyed how adventurous it was. Aside from that I applaud the movie makers for the humour sustained throughout the movie. it kept our eyes glued to the screen. I mean you've got to give them credit. The movie was a mixture of action, adventure and at the same time was funny. It totally kills any boring side.
 I also think we see a different Thor and Hulk now. They are no more the serious drama back then but now we see a fun loving super heroes with new and loving adventures. This movie also teaches us how hard Thor can be a tanker without his hammer. Can't wait for how the Thor group will end up in their current situation as we saw at the end of the movie.",10,1,6,4 February 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Great come back
","The previous reboot did have some critics They had different reasons for hating the older reboot. When this one came out I thought it will be bad, looking at how young Peter was. But I think it was great.The action scenes were good although most took place at the night and the plot was well written. It makes you understand well the struggles spider man goes through. It makes you see that spider man really isn't the biggest star in the marvel world but a guy just like us. It had some twists too. Who would have thought that Spiderman's lover was the daughter of the vulture.I think this spider man reboot wasn't really bad at all as anyone can enjoy it.",9,11,15,29 October 2017
Get Out," Excellent movie
","Daniel K is a good actor with his perfect portrayal of the character Chris. The movie wasn't scary to be frank but more entertaining than most horror movies. Each scene in the movie means a thousand words.Allison Williams also played a great role as the movie villain ranging from an innocent woman who dates a black guy to a crazy and monstrous woman ready to kill to have her victim's colored body hosted by older non-blacks.In all, the movie was entertaining and covered the area of racial discrimination in the United States in a creative, plot twisting way. I recommend this movie for all , from going to old.",10,13,25,11 November 2017
Logan," We'll miss Hugh Jackman
","I must say Logan was quite an entertaining film and that is what I expected from marvel since they are brilliant at making movies. To start, I'd like to say that if this is Hugh Jackman's last role if the wolverine then marvel is doomed. Hugh has been the perfect actor for the fictional character for over ten years. The role fits him quite well. I'm curious as to who will be his replacement. However, a new character being a female hero X-23 introduced. I think it was cute to see a little super hero girl but the disturbing part of the movie which i wasn't comfortable with, was how she got engaged with very dirty action scenes in the movie, for instance, holding the head of a villain she killed. She wasn't the only, other mutant kids had done dirty stuff to villains in the movie. The action and content was good and in all, it was great.",9,3,7,8 July 2017
Beauty and the Beast," I found it interesting
","When I heard of a live-action for this I was expecting it to follow a different story line and end up being bad. I was wrong anyway. The movie reminded me of the animated which I loved. The casting was great and well it was far better than I expected. It was captivating and the story kept us bonded. It had a very happy ending ,in all it was fun.I don't know why many others hate it but give it a chance. Not only did it bring the animated movie to life but also added some little more background. The movie deserves more.",10,4,9,19 June 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Not satisfied.
","Okay, let's just say this movie was good but not good enough to catch the eye of a true king Kong fan. Comparing this to the previous king Kong movies, this was poorly developed. It didn't satisfy my requirements since I have seen even better Kong movies.The acting was far from worst tho not the best. I was disappointed because I expected more. One of its major problems was the villain lizard thingy in the movie which for the whole entire movie concentrated on. King Kong is supposed to contain different dinosaurs all with the aim of killing. The other king Kong movies had that under their grip but this concentrated too much on the lizard which even didn't really impress me.",7,0,0,7 July 2017
Wonder Woman," DC is finally learning from their mistakes
","Ever since the batman movies, most recent DC movies have just ended up failing. Sometimes the content seems to take up whole if the action, other times there is too much of cheap editing. However, all of that changed in the wonder woman movie.Gal G was very good at the role of wonder woman although I must admit, I did not expect her to be that good at it. DC finally learned to make movies not too boring like they always do. The content was great and the mist interesting part of the movie was the action scenes. Sick and cool. The action scenes is one of the best on the planet. It was like a mixture of superhuman battle and some martial arts. Anyway, I think the movie is good enough to empower women naturally that they are not weak but stronger than they seem. Even when it seemed like Wonder W. was helpless, she over came it. I just wish DC will keep on making good movies like this.",10,6,16,6 July 2017
