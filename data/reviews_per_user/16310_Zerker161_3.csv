The Lobster," Brilliant
","Quite easily the greatest movie I've ever seen. It's as if someone took the surrealism of Rubber and added real depth to it. The movie's one and only flaw is the length, but other than that, it's flawless. The acting was robotic and dull, but with the intention of being so as it parallels the animalistic nature of love within society. The movie creates a drastically hyperbolic representation of society's push for us to find love, even if it isn't meaningful. Then it later shows us the push by the other side of society to avoid love in any form. Both sides harshly punish those who fail to meet their standards, and in the middle, we have our protagonist. A man who, in between worlds of fake love and forbidden love, finds real, true love. The City's policy of turning people into animals should they fail to find love, the robotic nature of the people and their tendencies to spew out information at others, and the surface level romance where people are attracted to one another based on things such as physical disabilities they may share are perfect example of how this society treats its people as animals who exist merely to breed. In all of this, however, our main character suffers and struggles through the loss of love and the finding of it. A masterpiece of cinema that is sorely underrated. In a mass of Michael Bay-esque movies with no story or character development in exchange for gross amounts of CGI and explosions, a rose like this with meaning and beauty to it is a gift to the dying culture of today's world. Watch this movie, I promise it will be worth it",10,3,7,5 July 2016
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Not Bad
","The movie overall was not too bad. The comedy wasn't subtle or clever, but it wasn't without its moments. There were parts that made me laugh out loud, and others that got a chuckle, and some where I just wasn't amused. The obvious parallel to Justin Beiber's career is great, as I despise Beiber and everything about him. The absurdly obnoxious narcissism of Connor is for the most part, the best aspect of this movie.Spoilers below this pointThe parody of TMZ had me laughing fairly hard, one of the better jokes in this movie. However some of the songs, particularly the 'Im Not Gay' and 'Bin Laden' songs were not spectacularly funny.Overall, not a movie you watch for brilliant comedy or artistic value as a parody of pop culture, but a movie you can enjoy and appreciate for its funnier moments",6,3,6,5 July 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Misunderstood
","Let me address some of the issues I have with the criticisms of this movie:Jesse Eisenberg's acting: People seem to have had hopes for the bald headed business man we've become accustomed to these days. DC was aiming for a more original Lex Luthor (and yes, Lex started as a skinny man with long hair). I found his performance to be excellent. His Lex Luthor gave me the impression of a psychotic Mark Zuckerberg, which is likely why they chose him in the first place. He felt like a child of the Lex Luthor we're used to and the Joker. Like a man who was cold and logical but would hunt you down and destroy every aspect of your life should you get in his way. I found his performance an excellent aspect of this movie.Batman killing people: The movie failed to get this across I admit, but upon reviewing this movie I've found out why Batman killed people. The impact of the Joker's murder of Robin and years of horror have broken Batman, turning him into the villains he's been fighting. He'd given up, hence Alfred's like 'the rage that turns good men... cruel' as he eyed Batman up and down. But at the end Batman mentions that he failed Superman in life, but he wont in death. Which tells me he plans to be a better person and return to his policy of not killing people.The Martha scene: As I said, Batman had become a villain. He hated Superman with such fury that he intended to kill him in that moment. As you may recall, Superman called him 'Bruce' when the fight began, which tells you Superman knew his real identity. Superman likely used the name Martha to manipulate Batman, not in a malicious way, but in a way to make him listen to him for that one moment. As Batman remembered the man who killed his mother, the man he was about to kill, and the mother that could die if he didn't stop, he woke up. Realizing the monster he'd become, he chooses to be a hero again.The Knightmare Dream sequence: I admit this scene was oddly placed and poorly transitioned into, but nonetheless it was very interesting to see a scene given as a vision by the Flash from the future. All in all this movie was not bad, but years of happy family- friendly Marvel movies have warped people's perceptions and made them critical of DC's darker movies. People saw Lex Luthor as a bald business man and were uncomfortable with a reimagining pf a character they'd known before. I think this movie is getting a bad rep for unnecessary reasons and should be appreciated for more than it was. It had issues, it had problems, but all in all it was not the abomination that critics made it out to be. It was a great movie and I'll be happy to see future DC movies",7,9,15,5 July 2016
