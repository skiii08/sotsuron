Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Ahh, to be a kid again
","I didn't know what to think as the movie started, because I found Jar Jar to be somewhat obnoxious.  However, as it got moving (the beginning is a bit slow) I found myself captivated and excited by the whole experience.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were great and I was very impressed by Jake Lloyd.This movie proves what can be done with digital animation.  There was only one point where I found it looked fake.  The rest was very convincing. Jar Jar is quite an accomplishment from a technical point of view (watch the light on him).After it was over, I found myself wanting to see it again (and again).  I felt like I did when I was a kid, wanting to be a Jedi Knight.  I was just fun and enthralling (there are lightsabre duels going on in my head as I type :-).  The end battle is incredible.  Simply put, I loved this movie.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
The Patriot," Good bit of film
","I really enjoyed this movie.  I was expecting something exactly like Braveheart, but it really wasn't.  Mel Gibson's character has no real desire to fight, even thought the reluctance is there.  The themes are similar, however.  Regardless, very well done film with good performances all round (esp. Gibson).  Not nearly as pro-American as other Roland Emmerich movies which was good, considering I'm not American :) (although the portrayal of the British seemed a bit stretched).  I never really saw it as American vs. British, but rather a personal struggle with the war as a backdrop.  The title is a bit misleading, IMO.I recommend people go see it.Woz",8,2,4,30 June 2000
Ocean's Eleven," A helluva good time
","This is one of those films that is just entertaining.  It's not deep.  It's not serious.  But it's a good time when you're watching it.Yes, it's a heist movie.  However, it's pretty slick and the characters are pretty 'cool'.  One of the first scenes with a bunch of young adults playing poker with the veteran con men is quite funny to watch.  'Look at these boys... all red!' one of the young kids says as he puts down an eclectic poker hand of hearts and diamonds.  Brad Pitt's character is the veteran teaching them and describes it as one of the longest hours of his life. This pretty much sets the tone for the whole film.This film is basically a comedy, but it's slick and wry comedy.  Lots of good lines delivered the way they need to be delivered: quickly.  I really liked this one.",9,0,1,7 December 2001
The Insider," Intense and inspiring
",This film reinforces my belief that some things really are worth fighting for.  It's a great 155 minutes that is worth your time.  It's a very intense experience.  It's also unnerving.  The camera work is incredible and (I almost hate saying this but...) daring.Highly recommended.,9,0,0,14 November 1999
