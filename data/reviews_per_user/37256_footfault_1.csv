Lucky Number Slevin," Great Movie
","This was probably the best movie I have seen in the past 3 years. Bruce Willis is always awesome, but particularly here. Amazing. Don't know who the actor who played Slevin was, but props for keeping up with an awesome cast. Of course Morgan Freeman can do no wrong, so he kicks a$$ as a mob boss. The bald guy from X-MEN (dont know his name either, sry) was hilarious. Witty dialog, nice action, great camera work. Only thing stopping this from a full out 10 is that my theater was full and a fat guy spilled his drink on me. Honestly, i cant list any improvements. People who say they didn't get it, see it again and PAY ATTENTION. It was amazingly well thought out, but people are used to not have to think in action movies. However, in no way did they spend too much time on the (awesome)plot. Tons of action. This honestly reminded me of about 6 or 7 great movies rolled into one. A must see for all boys young and old, and girls from about 12-35",9,0,5,5 May 2006
