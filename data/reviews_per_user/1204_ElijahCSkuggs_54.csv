The Blair Witch Project," Revisiting after 8 years.
","And it's still a good flick. I saw this as soon as it came out. It was opening day, before it went nation-wide. We drove to downtown Cambridge to watch it at the Kendall Square Cinema. This is before the hype went out of control and when people were seriously confused if it was real or not. To those people, to this day, I still shake my head.The Blair Witch Project is a movie that will go down in history as a classic. It's a time-less film that has aged very well. It's arguably one of the creepiest and most frightening movies of the past decade, and possibly all-time. It's a rare movie, that uses silence and barely any blood to get it's message across. I can't even remember the last movie to scare the masses in such a simple way.My biggest gripe with Blair Project was and still is the movie not showing even a hint of the Blair Witch. Watching the movie yesterday, I knew the ending so I was never really scared. But the movie still conjured up a few chills due to the dark woods and frantic situations. Just a glimpse would have made this movie so much more a hit. That is by far the biggest gripe about this movie. People feel cheated when things are happening, but nothing is really delivered. A glimpse at the end of feet floating across the camera on the ground, would have done wonders. But oh well.The Blair Witch Project is a wonder of sorts. Only costing pocket change but making millions. Having unknown producers and actors, but still having the movie come off as real footage. Sure there are people who hated this movie, but overall the Blair Witch Project is a feat in the film industry that can never be denied. It's a film all horror fans should see and most likely all will sometime or another.",8,1,3,23 November 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat Visits Crazy U.S. of Americas
","I've seen a couple Borat episodes on Ali G and I thought they were OK. Nothing special, just a talented comedian acting like a weirdo foreigner. Well, this movie is pretty much the same thing. If you love his show, you'll love the movie. It's that simple. I saw a 10:50 am showing of this movie hoping the crowd would be small. Because I really hate being stuck in a theater with a bunch of retards that laugh at every single thing. Unfortunately the theater was packed, and I sat next to two fat kids who laughed nonstop, both having wheezy, spit filled throats, mixed with a dash of nerd. Then I have a dude that snorted like a pig to my left, but that was actually funny. I thought the movie was amusing, fast paced, pretty funny and surprisingly smart. There is a whole lot going on this movie - it's full of satirical jokes, scat humor, and ridiculous situations. But I just didn't find it really, really funny like how everyone else is. I would say I laughed out loud a handful number of times. Don't get me wrong, I get it, he plays a slow foreigner with little common sense. That is funny, but it's not 'one of the funniest comedies of all time'. Personally I found Jackass 2 to be much funnier. The movie is easily recommendable and my main reason saying that is that Sasha is a really talented comedian, performer and actor. The movie has displayed our society in a crazy eye opening way that I haven't seen before. That was definitely the most humorous part of the movie for me. Watching how crazy our country is. I never realized how nuts these religious types are. Those dudes are probably exactly like the fanatics overseas. It's definitely one of the better comedies to come out in a long time. It's much better than any recent Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell movie. I give it a 7 1/2 outta 10. Most likely will rise after another viewing.",7,2,6,3 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk and Tim Roth: Two reasons you should see this film.
","Well Marvel fans, it's time for the unofficial sequel to Ang Lee's HULK, and this time...it's a darker more menacing looking Hulk that is unleashed.The Hulk, and the awesome special FX that bring him to life have made the mean green machine as ripped, shredded, and jacked to the most ultimate degree. I'm pretty sure the FX guys created muscles to add onto the Hulk's already massive build.The beginning is actually the most solid part of the film, as the filmmakers do a very nice job of showing the lengths Dr. Banner has went to in order to steady his excitement factor. Though moving to Brazil  a country fraught with smoking hot babes  and working in a factory  with all sorts of dangerous equipment  might not be the best choice.Of course the sh!t hits the fan and Banner is forced to leave South America and head home. Once he arrives home, he meets up with the sexy Liv Tyler and plans to meet a fellow scientist who may be able to cure his affliction. But General Ross and Emil Blonsky have different ideas, and make it very difficult for Banner to do anything...without getting very, very irritated.The Abomination is revealed at the film's climax and the action that fills the film is monstrous to say the least. Big explosions, big punches, and big roars fill this movie! So why is it a little disappointing? The writing is not very good, the FX wane, dumb choices are made, and it seemed rushed at times.Why is it good? Very mean looking Hulk. He is truly a monster. And because of the Abomination, and Tim Roth. Roth will always play a great bad guy.So you see, this film is pretty damn good. But I thought the first was also pretty damn good (better as a comic book stylized film), so..see it for your self.ALSO: It has the best cameo of the year by ease. No not Stan Lee. None other than Rickson Gracie as Banner's Aikido teacher. Nuff' said!!!",Null,4,7,16 June 2008
In Bruges," Surprisingly Sensitive and Funny
","Whenever I went to the theater, no matter the movie, In Bruges would be one of the previews. Truthfully, not being a big fan of Colin, I was getting very sick of seeing it. But after hearing all the good word, I decided to buck up and check it out. And damn, this was a real good flick.Story focuses on two hit men who are sent to a beautiful and culture rich city in Belgium, known as Bruges. They're both to stay put in Bruges and keep a low profile until they hear word from their boss, Harry.Bruges is a gorgeous, quaint looking city with canals and cobblestone roads. One would think anyone would love to spend time here, but this isn't the case with this odd couple. The two men both share a profession, but not tastes. And this is where some really nice humor plays in. One appreciates life, the other not so much. The story focuses on why these two see life in different manners which really gives the film some great character development. And this is where the movie shines best. In it's two leading men and their banter with one another. From just talking about beer or how silly something is, to serious issues of death and the afterlife. It's all very entertaining which makes the movie move at a fast clip.Like any other flick with Irish actors, you've got the silly observational type humor, the thick as a brick accents and the motormouth way of speaking. It's all good, but I have a tough time hearing/understanding them quite a bit. If you're like me, this is just a warning to keep your ears open.In Bruges was a surprisingly good flick with great performances by the two leads and two supporting actors being the characters Harry and Jimmy. The others, like Ray's girly, were nothing special. She really just felt like a model thrown into the mix. Besides that, anyone who enjoys a well-written flick, a little blood and some taboo themes should definitely check it out.",8,4,9,9 April 2008
Chinatown," 'I'm going to sue the sh!t out of them.'
","After hearing and reading so much about this film, I figured it was time to check it out.And, I'm certainly glad I did.Chinatown has some of the wittiest writing this side of film, and though it hardly plays for laughs, the superb acting and delivery coupled with some really great back and forth had me cracking up from time to time.Of course the film isn't a comedy, but a scandalous murder mystery set around the death of a water department tycoon in California's 1940's.Jack Nicholson is great, as is the norm, and John Huston, well, you tend to have pretty strong feelings for his character by the film's depressing climax. Faye Dunaway plays her role wonderfully; it seemed so natural.As long as no one spoils the ending for you, be prepared for a mixture of emotions.Polanski did a wonderful job directing, the music is perfect, Robert Towne's script is alive and kicking! Chinatown is great film noir with more than a few memorable confrontations and conversations.",8,1,3,15 May 2008
Citizen Kane," Citizen Reigns
","I had put this film off for far too long.So two weeks ago I finally sat down and watched what the world has deemed the best motion picture of all time.And to some degree, they're right.'Citizen Kane' is arguably the most influential masterpiece created, and it's achieved such a high standing for numerous stellar attributes.Direction, cinematography, acting, and story-telling is what drove this film, and not for an instant was I bored or looking at the digital clock on my window sill.The film carries such dignity that it practically roars at it's viewer to pay attention.Charles Foster Kane's story at it's most simple is a rags to riches tale where a desire to separate himself from the rest, the competition, would change his life and the society that he overwhelmed.Kane. The journalist, the playboy, the tycoon, the politician. A movie about a man, his last words, and the world he ran.",10,1,5,29 April 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Enormously trumped up and overrated!!!!!!
","PotC2 is one of those movies that has a lot of great assets to it, but then has so many damn plot holes and unfinished business that you want to punch Keira Knightley for being such a hot snob...? The main characters were lousy: Johnny Depp was just average, Keira Knightley's character was loathsome, especially towards the end of the film, Orlando Bloom was the most likable, and most heroic...The movie's sole redeeming features were the unbelievable FX. Davy Jones' crew and himself were over the top and badass, but the film's main monster was kind of a letdown. The film was also too damn long, with some scenes growing monotonous even with crazy crap going on. Man, I was disappointed with this flick; all I wanted to do was be entertained, and I ended up hating Keira Knightley, and Jack Sparrow for that matter. Maybe the next one will give a little rehash on Sparrow's life, and possibly redeem the lackluster screen time he had in this FX laden, FX carrying, letdown. Did I mention the Fx were great?",6,2,4,13 July 2006
Hostel," Good but not great...
","After waiting for some time with much anticipation for the Tarantino/Roth horror film, 'Hostel' finally made it's way to my local cinema. After an assembly of ridiculously bad horror previews, the film finally came up and I eased back in my chair. The film's first half or so was albeit, not horror in any way shape or form, and more so was a closer relative to a National Lampoon sex romp. The three main actors were thankfully enough, good at who and what they were trying to emulate: horny, college grads who want sex and drugs...but they were funny and occasionally kind of down to earth. Eli Roth did a fair job of setting up the story, though i felt it took a little long for a horror film. As great a storyteller Miike is, and as much as Roth adores him, I would've figured the film to have an overall creepy quality, but alas no. The music was well done, especially when the horror comes crashing in, and the direction was pretty good, showing us a good amount of gore, and then a good amount for us to leave to our sick imaginations. My only complaint about the film was the tiresome nudity and sex, teens will love it, as will college students, but it gets old fast. I never knew Roth relied on such frivolities to make a film move along, then again 'Cabin Fever' did the exact same thing. The latter half of the film was very good, and occasionally bordered on the awesome. I wish there was more gore, though there was some, and I was hoping to get more glimpses into the other rooms that lined the slaughterhouse. The best scenes were easily inside this 'factory' and if the whole movie was set up faster for more time inside the 'farm,' this movie would've been great, and not just good.",6,3,6,9 January 2006
Zodiac," The Main Maniac: The Zodiac
","Going into Zodiac I was somewhat aware of who the Zodiac killer was, but I knew nothing about what type of investigation was put forth. I knew that the Zodiac killer was never caught, but I didn't know the killer teased the media and police with notes and phone calls. Actually, I thought the Zodiac killer was never even close to being captured. This movie also sheds a new light on this. The movie brings you deep into the world of investigating and brings you back to the days where you were afraid to go outside, or even let your kids go to school on the bus. Led by Fincher's directing and followed by the professional acting of probably a dozen known actors, the movie's runtime of two and a half hours barely feels like it....unless, you have achey knees or no butt muscles. :) I just need to give a shout to John Carroll Lynch from The Drew Carey Show, he plays his role incredibly well, 100% believable and inspired. If you're into crime/mystery/serial killer movies, or if you're looking for some more information on the Zodiac Killer and the investigation, look no further. 8 outta 10",8,2,6,3 March 2007
Cloverfield," Young Hollywood's take on the Monster Genre
","My topic alone should tell you straight away if you're going to enjoy this movie or not. There is a group of people who actually enjoy Young Hollywood and their movies, and then there are people, like myself who can't f@ckin stand 90% of the sh!t they feed us. I suppose you can guess from this last sentence what I thought of this movie. There are people in the middle ground where they tend to enjoy Y.Hollywood's flicks more or less, but I'd be the first to shake my head at their tastes....though with an open ear.Anyways, about the movie. The story is, as you know, found footage of a group of rich, young adults who are filming the destruction of NYC. And as you know again, it's by a giant monster. But what is the movie? Just them running and running just trying to escape, which would be the smart thing to do. No, instead they are on a rescue mission to find a girlfriend, or that's the easiest way to describe their relationship. Big surprise there huh? Y. Hollywood just HAS to include a nonsensical love mission that completely endangers everyone to unimaginable heights. Sure, I'd agree that it's a bold and brave thing to do, but when the guy in charge of this rescue mission is a complete narcissist who has ONLY this one agenda on his mind, it goes from being heroic to completely out-of-line and (insert negative word). How many times do you have to scream his name in his face for him to even glimpse at you?? But he gets away with it. The others obviously don't really care about living that much and I guess are in love with Beth as much as he is. Or do they just love this Hero so much that they'd follow him to the depths of hell? The whole rescue mission really doesn't even pay off very well. The actors are you're typical WB/FOX type pretties, and mixed with that typical Hollywood acting you're also given a very, very Y.Hollywood screenplay. If any of you are even slightly aware of the route Y.Hollywood has taken with humor, you'd know that the coolest humor at the moment is the type of humor the Fat Jewish Kid in Superbad delivers. I enjoyed Superbad by the way. Anyways, the actor using the camera delivers lines incredibly similar to the Fat Kid in Superbad. Though he did sound like Jake Busey....which ain't bad. The humor is very weak and predictable and just lame. But hey, it has it's fans, I'm just not one of them. I can go on and on about how pathetic this group of friends are, but maybe that was what the writer was trying to get across. How self-obsession still remains prevalent even when sh!t hits the fan. They should have dropped that love story right off the bat, but what do you expect from the creators of Felicity.Getting to the monster. It's cool. It's not bad. But it's a TOTAL rip-off of the PS3 launch title Resistance: Fall of Man. Go ahead, look up the game, and look at the creature designs. The resemblance is uncanny, and if you know of the game, when seeing the monster(s) for the first time, the surprise is nothing of a surprise. But, if you're not like me, you should enjoy the way it looks, it's unique, right Insomniac games? But I do still have another issue related to the Monster. The monster drops little creatures that are about the size of large Capibaras (ha!). Why do all monster movies these days have to include little creatures? Yeah I get that it's heightens the danger factor, but it's officially getting old, and it's pretty lame thinking. Creativity in Y.Hollywood is crap.And for people looking for scares, no, there are zero genuine scares. There are jump scenes, which use the played out formula combining Incredibly Quick Visuals mixed with Sudden Loud Music/Sound Effects. And even when they're in a tunnel that's pitch dark, you still see the scares coming a mile away. 'I can't see!' 'Oh it has Night Vision, here let me help you.' Okay, what happens when they turn on the night vision? Yep.The only good aspects to this movie are the impressive visuals, cool monster *ahem*, and when the monster is on screen the movie actually works very well. But there is far, far too much Y.Hollywood bullcrap and no way near enough Monster. This is just more over-hyped Hollywood sh!t, that fails to deliver. But hell, if you do enjoy Y.Hollywood flicks, this movie will be you're film of the year. It's got everything you want, the pretty faces, the lame script, the side story of love....ugh, what a piece of crap. 4.5 outta 10",5,26,48,19 January 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Thank God for Guillermo.
","Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo Del Toro is the film we fantasy and horror fans have been salivating for. What an imaginative spectacle Del Toro has created here, a pure delight on every conceivable spectrum. A young girl, Ophelia, is sent to a mountain army station with her pregnant mother, in order for her sibling to born in the presence of the her stepfather, the Captain. The environment is hostile, but the sides are drawn clear early on in the film, and an even side story between guerrillas and their opposition give the film a realism that juxtaposes with the movie's terrific fairy tale premise. Shortly there after, Ophelia discovers a fairy and is soon led to a labyrinth on the army stations outskirts. Her arrival in the maze is something of prophecy, and once she delves deeper in, the best part of the movie begins. Great visuals and equal acting highlight the film from start to fin. And though a couple parts seem to be rushed for the sake of time, Del Toro directs effortlessly, mixing realism with fiction sublimely. A perfect score as well as a captivating story hold this film high above all others this year. 9.5 outta 10",10,5,11,14 January 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Now that's a close shave!!! Yeesh.
","I actually can't remember the last time I saw a musical; skipped Dream Girls, passed up Moulin Rouge, but this SWEENEY TODD: DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET seemed to hit a certain chord with me: the vocal cords! And they were slashed all movie long! Sweeney Todd is Tim Burton's horror/musical that looks as good as it sounds, with dark humor abound and open neck wounds wherever one looks. Sounds good? It is.I've never seen the play, and only knew slightly of its story, but the characters involved, all flawed and charismatic, do a great job singing and acting. The music is excellent even though Danny Elfman wasn't to be found, and Burton's directing style seems to really shine with his version of a barber whose lost it all.There were a couple things that bothered me: one being an ending that despite all its bloody grandeur seemed to lose sight of a couple characters, and some occasional predictable situations.But never mind such frivolous drawbacks, this film is just great entertainment. And boy can Depp and that Bower guy sing! Everyone does a great job(perhaps excluding the young statuesque Toby) and Helena Bonham Carter is as morbidly hot as ever. I love corsets!",7,3,5,21 December 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Behold the Star Power!
","Sometimes I like to watch mainstream, blockbuster extravaganza type movies. Sometimes I just wanna mimic Al Bundy, stick my hands down my pants and just completely unravel myself in an entertaining Hollywood, star-powered, cinema party. So I go out and rent Ocean's 13. And ya know what? It did the trick. The movie had the wit, the charm, the star-power and the pretty fun story to pass 2 hours of my miserable life. I suppose at a couple times during the flick I had to think a little bit about what was going on since this story was pretty involving with what they were trying to accomplish; a heist, a man-made earthquake, seducing women....lotsa stuff. But hell, I had fun while watching it and I reckon you will too.",8,1,2,14 November 2007
Gone Baby Gone," The Grimiest Side of Boston
","Ben Affleck has managed to redeem himself entirely with 'Gone Baby Gone,' a detective/mystery film based on the Dennis Lehane novel about a missing girl and the numerous affiliations that attempt to find her. Murder, drugs, poor parenting; the film is an amalgam of morals and ethics with an ending that will inevitably split the audience in half.For me, being from Chelsea, MA originally, and then moving to the North Shore of Massachusetts, I thought 'Gone' was more Bostonian than the slightly superior and successful 'The Departed.' Though not all of Boston and its surrounding areas are grim, profane and hard-nosed, the truth remains, a good portion of it is. The quick wit and hilarious swear spouting of Boston drunkards is realistically portrayed, and I found myself shaking my head at some of the back and forth, easily envisioning something like it just around the block. I'll give sincere credit to Affleck and Aaron Stockard for their adapted screenplay, and even more credit to a cast who not once, I think, go overboard with their accents, something even Matt Damon did in 'The Departed.' Ed Harris and Casey Affleck especially.As far as the film goes, the atmosphere is definitely there. Great use of location, again better than 'The Departed,' and the instant casting procedure Affleck used in the film works perfectly.The film manages to build and tear down notions and ideas with ease, keeping you guessing up until the the last fifteen minutes or so, and through sound and logical editing, the film rolls along at a nice clip, never getting too preachy or boring.Great acting by everyone involved(even side characters had strong presence), inspired direction, appropriate cinematography and a heavy handed story of knowing when and how to make the right decisions.",9,0,1,6 November 2007
28 Weeks Later," Better, but not scarier.
","The sequel to 28 Days Later is 28 Weeks Later, and it's very good. There's a new director, a new story and characters, and WAY more production value. It took some warming up to(I was a little mixed after the ending), but this film is a definite watch. This is an action/horror/thriller with some really intense and well executed scenes of carnage and chases, as well as some fiery explosions that had me wide-eyed for the better part of 99 minutes. The film is not perfect of course, due to some very inept decision making by certain leads(a quality that always seems to pop up in standard horror) and a noticeable lack in the scare department; despite occasional scenes, the original takes the cake for the more frightening moments, though Weeks has its fair share of discomfort. But, it is not average, and a seasoned actor like Robert Carlyle ensured that it wasn't. He has some great scenes, and his acting abilities are fun to watch, ala Ravenous. Extremely loud sound effects and some bad choices aside, 28 Weeks Later is really fast-paced, violent fun with cool make-up and a decent soundtrack.",8,1,5,12 June 2007
American Psycho," In comparison to the book, this is rated G
","So I've seen this movie a couple times, and after some recommendations, I decided to read the book.I don't want to turn this into a book review, but let's just say that if you're interested in something a little more graphic, a little more dark, and a little more in depth  check out the book. Immediately. And when I say 'a little more,' that means a crap load more. It's also a lot funnier than the movie.But as far as the flick goes, it's also not too shabby. Not shabby at all.It has a nice visual style, solid directing, good pacing, and a performance from Christian Bale  especially in the last 15 minutes or so  that is simply awesome. His work is reason enough to see it alone. And I'm no Bale-kisser either. He's just damn good in this.So aside from the acting, there's some blood, some sex, some nudity, some Huey Lewis and the News, and a few hilarious scenes that make you shake your head.As much as they suck when you have to deal with them, snobs are funny, and this movie demonstrates just that. And throws in a few psychotic murders to boot.Watch the movie (rated R) and read the book (you can't rate that stuff).",8,1,2,21 August 2008
The Orphanage," Very good film with a pair of distractions.
","When I first saw that Del Toro's name was attached to the movie I got a little nervous. I'm a very big fan of Mr. Del Toro's work...all of his work. So when hearing this, I got nervous, thinking that he may turn into the next Eli Roth or Tarantino. But thankfully, The Orphanage is a movie any director should be proud to relate himself to.The Orphange is about a mother trying to figure out how and why her little boy has disappeared. Strange events are taking place, but instead of taking off and leaving the spooky house, Mama Laura bucks up and stays strong on course to figure out what happened to her child.The Orphanage is a incredibly well shot and directed film. There are many, many creative uses of cinematography. And with a smart mix of cinematography and direction, the movie truly shines when the eerie and powerful music takes hold. The acting itself is pretty good, not anything truly award-winning, but mostly very believable. One scene in particular, the scene with Laura running on the beach panicking, that was not impressive on any account. It was shaky camera, and just a weird jumbled 'mess'. They may have been going for a true panicky situation, but it really just felt silly and over-played. Besides the fantastic production values and respectable acting, the movie moved at a quick pace and had some truly creepy and tense filled moments. One thing I applaud the movie is the way they use the tension and scares. They take the scenes of tension and build them up to pretty great levels, but there really isn't a 'payoff'. It's mostly just a lot of big build ups. This is not a bad thing. Today's horror films all use very cheap means to scare the audience. I, for one, am completely sick of films that use scenes of cheap tricks to jolt the audience. Incredibly fast shots mixed with very loud sounds is all that is I see these days. For example, in the previews for this movie, they showed Jessica Alba's new movie. It's the American remake of The Eye. The final scene of the trailer is exactly what I'm talking about. A film with genuine tension and build up is rare these days, and this a film with it. One other film that uses this technique well is the somewhat underrated The Abandoned. Films like The Changeling, Suspiria and An American Werewolf in London, they all happen to use build-up and true horror tension rather than cheap technical bullsh!t.ONE other thing! Or should I say TWO. The mother, her breasts. To this day, I haven't stared at a pair of tits more in my entire life. For a homely, motherly wife, she had the fakest pair of tits around. The woman was gorgeous already, and when she's bouncing around in those tight shirts, it seriously became a distraction for me. Gorgeous, gorgeous woman, with a fantastic pair of fake breasts. Not really a problem for me overall, but hell, they WERE distracting for a large part of the film.Overall, there are plenty of things to complain about with this movie. But in the big scheme of things horror related, this is a breath of fresh air. It's beautiful, chilling and entertaining. If you enjoy horror/mysteries ala Devil's Backbone, this will be right up your alley.",8,4,10,11 January 2008
Ratatouille," Prediction: Pet Rat Sales Sky Rocket!
","Being a gigantic fan of Vermin and Gourmet Cooking I just had to see this. Pixar is back with another fantastic, funny, warm-hearted adventure that is really going to stand the test of time. So far the reviews for Ratatouille are unbelievable and I don't think they'll ever let up. And ya know what, this movie deserves all the praise it's gonna get.Ratatouille is the story about a little rat named Remy. Remy is basically your regular looking rat. Though Remy is a little different. What separates him from his fellow rats is that he's got a special talent. Remy's little schnoz is incredibly fine-tuned. He can smell this from that with no problem whatsoever. Well, this amazing smelling ability gives him fantastic ideas when it comes to food, and eventually cooking. What follows is a timeless tale where Remy and his pal Linguini take to the kitchen to resurrect a once world re-known french restaurant. Will they satisfy the food critics? Or will they get fried?Ratatouille is a perfect movie-going experience. I really can't find anything wrong with it. Entertaining situations led by unique characters with amazing voice work. Every environment be it the Paris backdrop, an Old Lady's backyard or even an awkward chef's pad is absolutely stunning. Ratatouille isn't just for the wee ones either. Pretty much all the jokes are adult-level humor. Obviously you got the slips and falls and one-joke characters that the kids will love, but so will the grown-ups. The writing is top notch stuff, some of the best writing around without a doubt. I can't recommend this flick enough. Bring the entire family and have a great time.",10,3,5,29 June 2007
Saw III," Saw 3: Thy Name is Revenge
","Well, not being a huge fan of the first Saw, but enjoying it. Saw 2 showed up and sucked. I thought it was just a mess of a film, acting above all. Well thankfully Saw 3 has taken a step forward. Saw 3 is better than the first two. It doesn't have the mysterious charm of the first, but it's story is deeper and the deaths are bloodier, gorier and overall just better.Story is about the bedridden Jigsaw needing help due to the tumor growing on his brain. His accomplice (the chick from the 2nd) is helping out, and she manages to get kidnap a doctor to help save Jigsaw....obviously a deadly game is involved. The story/game in this flick is on a much larger scale than the previous two films. There is also a couple throw in 'games' and a side story (my favorite part of the film) which is thrown into the mix.I kind of thought Saw 3 was a little long. They kept showing you what you were supposed to be thinking through short clips....I would say this is the most predictable Saw 3 yet, so these clips weren't really needed. But they are helpful. I also didn't like the accomplice to Jigsaw...she's a little too good at what she does, for being an amateur. I can complain about stuff till the cows come home, but I'd rather just say that this movie will most likely be a huge hit for Saw fans and Saw haters won't hate so much anymore....maybe not. It's not a bad movie...I wouldn't say it's a great movie. But it was pretty unique and gory. Pretty good flick. 7 outta 10",7,0,1,28 October 2006
Tropic Thunder," Delivered exactly what the trailer promised.
","Seeing Robert Downey Jr. play a black dude as an Australian was just a tad too much ridiculousness for me not to go see this. Also with Ben and Jack, two funny dudes in their own right and a fantastic action movie setting, it's kind of a must see. Well, if you're looking for laughs and violence, this is your movie.Tropic Thunder was consistently funny, and moved at a pace that left you with zero lulls. Some of the jokes, like the dancing was a little out of left field and didn't do anything for me or the audience I saw it with, but besides that, the majority of the jokes hit their mark, and every character brought something to the table. Maybe a tad more gore would have been nice, since they showed some great promise early on in the flick. But again, Tropic Thunder delivers exactly what the trailer promises; fantastic over-the-top performances (especially by Downey and Black), and lots of silly humor (even some fart jokes for good measure).",8,2,6,13 August 2008
No Country for Old Men," The Embodiment of Evil
","NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the Coen brothers best and most violent work to date, and arguably, has the best ensemble of actors this year.Set in New Mexico, the story begins with a local hunter/welder named Llewelyn Moss stumbling across a rotting group of pickups and corpses. He carefully makes his way through the bodies, picking up spare guns and ammo, and eventually comes across a case of two million dollars, the lone key to an early retirement for him and his wife, Carla Jean. He goes home for a short while, then due to certain earlier events, Moss returns to the scene of the crime to hopefully clear his conscience. From there on out, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN roars off into the realm of classic cat and mouse cinema, and the villain Anton Chigurh is introduced.Void of music, NC4OM relies on the sound of boots and bullets in a way that I've never experienced. Every sound, however minute, brings forth an air of tension not commonly seen in films; from the soft clang of Chigurh's cannister to the empty wind that circulates the barren wasteland of the southwest, sound is used perfectly in this film.The cinematography is exceptional; the wide open spaces and blue skies encompass the screen with such a majesty that one feels tempted to flee the confines of the theater and walk among the desert and shrubs. As long as Anton is far from sight.NC4OM is really pretty flawless film making, and despite the perfect score there were a couple very minor questions that remained unanswered(I'm sure the book will clarify), but all in all, from the direction to the acting, from the sound to the cinematography, and then everything in between, this film was great.The film's most lasting impression however is the character of Anton Chigurh, Moss' inexorable assailant whose personal philosophy and moral weight instantly catapults him to judge, jury and executioner. He is evil in every form of the word, and could very well be interpreted as a walking Armageddon or perhaps even Satan. Javier Bardem is great in this role, and will most likely have to battle Casey Affleck /Ed Harris/Steve Zahn for any best supporting actor nominations this year. Though of course, there would be little deliberation if Anton Chigurh had anything to do with it.",10,5,12,18 November 2007
District 9," Gritty sci-fi action at it's coolest.
","When it comes down to things alien, I'm on board.Well, most things involving aliens.During the previews for 'District 9' some alien abduction flick with Milla Jovovich came on, 'The Fourth Sign' - and it looked like total crap. Not because I dislike the idea of alien abduction but because it was a stylized and over-done looking piece of Hollywood hogwash. With screeching sound effects, manic editing, and ridiculous over-acting, said Jovovich sci-fi flick appears to be a lame attempt to cash in on this possible booming genre.Funny, 'District 9' had two of those attributes, yet it still managed to turn them into positives instead of negatives.As you know by now, 'District 9' revolves around aliens landing and subsequently becoming trapped on Earth. They're eventually sectioned off and forced to live in slum-like conditions. After 20 years of this, the people of surrounding Johannesburg are fed up with the aliens and want them out. So MNU (Multi-National United) hatches a plan to move the alien species hundreds of miles south. But that's easier said than done. While during a preliminary phase, our lead character is delt an unfortunate hand and is treading in deep water that encompasses shady corporations and alien welfare.Neil Blommkamp is, without a doubt, a bright spot in the world of cinema. If you've seen any of his previous work there should be zero doubt of this man's imagination and his talent to wield such creativity. From a simple sneaker commercial that dazzles the eyes; to a short about a robot who's dealing with human emotions; or to an action-packed short movie which was made for Halo 3, everything he seems to touch is special. And with District 9, it's no different.Blending social commentary, action-packed fire-fights, ingenious weaponry, slimy and awesome special effects, he is everything a fan of sci-fi/action movies should be waiting for. And when it comes down to the special effects, they truly are a spectacle. He uses this somewhat out-of-focus approach of CGI, fused with remarkable make-up effects to create scenes of tremendous impact.The movie isn't perfect, obviously, but what it does do, it does well. Very well.I would have loved a more in-depth story, with more answers (concerning the aliens), but I can easily settle for this, as it ended on a note that I was very content with. The acting was all pretty good for the most part as everyone involved was obviously very dedicated and gung-ho to be apart of this film. But the characters themselves and some parts of the dialogue felt a tad cliché at times.Overall, 'District 9' delivered a true cinematic experience that I haven't seen in a long time. It felt like an awesome mix of 'Starship Troopers' and 'City of God'. Now how cool is that? With Neil talking about creating a scifi epic next, the sky is truly the limit for this dude.",9,8,15,14 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," One of the best of 2007
","One of the very best films of 2007 is THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD starring Brad Pitt as the infamous Jesse James and Casey Affleck as his murderer, Robert Ford.In the mid 1800's, the James brothers were the key figures of a gang centralized in Missouri most notably famous for robbing trains all throughout the Midwest. They were in many young men and women's eyes, saviors and modern day legends that broke free from the strain and boredom of everyday life, stealing from the rich, living spontaneously, questioning and denying the government. It was a life that many tried, but only a handful mastered. Arguably the most culturally popular man at the time, for his handsome and eccentric looks, his even yet dangerous temper, and his wily and daredevil lifestyle, Jesse James was envied far and wide; especially by Robert Ford, a young man who once only admired James from comic strips, preaching his law and emulating his gait and dress, but soon, through the connection of his brother Charley Ford, became one of his most trusted side kicks.The rest is history.JESSE JAMES is a beautiful film to look at with great cinematography of wide snow swept landscapes by Roger Deakins and authentic costume design, as well as an interesting and appropriate score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. But the acting really holds this film above the clouds with Pitt and Affleck both giving performances of their careers, Sam Rockwell as Charley Ford is also great in support. Pitt was born to play Jesse James as was Affleck to play Bob Ford.A great study of what these men may have been like, and how fate linked them forever.",8,3,7,18 December 2007
Cars," Zoomah Zoomah Zoom and a Boom Boom
","I'm just gonna keep this nice and short. The story is about a rookie race car named Lightning McQueen. He's on the verge of becoming the first rookie car to win the Piston Cup, which is the 'holy grail' of races. Unfortunately for Lightning he gets held up in a small, down on it's luck town called Radiator Springs. Lightning needs to get to California in time to make it for the biggest race in racing history. But will he? Will he end up loving Radiator Springs? Will he find a love? Will he learn life lessons? Will Radiator Springs become the thriving community it once was? Well watch Cars to find out.Cars isn't as bad as everyone says. It has fantastic animation (obviously) has some neat ideas, and a bunch of characters. But unfortunately the movie doesn't do a damn thing new. For every question I asked above, it doesn't take a genius to figure out the answer. The movie also goes on for a little too long. At almost 2 hours, it definitely wears on you. Even though it doesn't bring anything new to the table, it still has a very vibrant feel, has some good voice-acting (though Owen Wilson needs some getting used to), and it's pretty entertaining. It's possibly the worst of the Pixar films, but that's really not saying much, since all Pixar movies are fantastic, and this just misses the mark. For example, pretend all the Pixar movies are in a Car race...The Piston Cup. The Incredibles finishes first, and Cars finishes last. But hey, only the big boys are invited to compete in this race, and it's obvious Cars is capable of competing, but it seems the Cars pit crew just didn't work hard enough.",7,0,1,17 January 2008
Hellboy," Ron Perlman can do no wrong...
","After watching 'Hellboy' at my local cinema, I left the theater feeling that though I had enjoyed myself, something was inevitably missing.  It wasn't till a few hours later that I began to reminisce about the movie. Nothing was missing, other than maybe a great script, but this comic to film adaptation was great fun and the acting and makeup and special effects were awesome.  The bad guy in the film sucked but that was the only problem.  Ron Perlman is the man, and so wasn't the crazy guy with the black mask on. Guillermo del Toro obviously loves the horror/action genre, as do I, and I hope he remains forever a horror director.  This film is definitely worth the price of a matinee admission, and it should be a cool DVD!  Now I'm waiting for del Toro's H.P. Lovecraft 'At the Mountains of Madness', which should be unbelievable, and of course I'm waiting for a film adaptation of a Silver Surfer movie, or perhaps the Infinity Gauntlet!

Schindler's List," The Apex of Film-making
","SCHINDLER'S LIST, based on the book by Thomas Keneally, is the closest thing to a perfect picture that I've ever seen. There are others that would qualify, but none have given me the emotional wallop that this did back in '93.The acting is perfect, mesmerizing in some cases, especially by Ralph Fiennes; the score is beautiful and unforgettable; the direction is masterful, and the use of crisp black and white color underlies the film's realism and dark history.The legacy of Oskar Schindler was new to me when I first saw this, and thanks to Spielberg, the story of one man's change of heart will be remembered forever. SCHINDLER'S LIST, to this day, is a prime example of inspired and mesmerizing cinema.",10,9,14,13 November 2007
The Mist," Scares? Not here. Suspense? Sorry. Lots of scary monsters? Nope, just bugs.
","First off, my favorite sub-genre in horror is the Monster/Creature genre. So when I saw the tentacles grab the dude in the preview I was all excited. 'Alright, The Host and now this. Fantastic.' Well, sh!t. This movie let me down in almost all facets. The story goes like this: Gigantic electrical storm. Next day the mysterious mist is noticed, but no one is concerned. Main characters head to Food Store to pick up supplies etc. There they run into a man with a bloody nose who said an acquaintance was just taken by something in the mist. Some nice scenes take place pretty early on including the generator scene and some nice Mist rolling over the surrounding area. Bang, suddenly the movie hits a gear that was just incredibly unappealing. There are zero scares, unless you count the cheap scares; loud noises, scares you see coming a mile away but are made to make you jump no matter what. For a movie that revolves around Mist and not knowing what's out there, and realizing how low it reads on the Tension-meter, is astounding. But instead of focusing on the creatures and the mist, they have to add the evil human characters. That entire sub-plot was a draining part of the story. I just didn't care in the slightest what she was saying, how people were reacting to her or anything. Just completely useless in my book. Show me the big creatures, give me some serious suspense, show me some blood! Well, you don't get much of it, and probably half of the blood you see is human caused. Weak. Besides the story being a letdown, there were also many others aspects I disliked. The characters overall were very unlikable, most likely because they were just cliché, been there done that stuff. Come on now, they had a elderly lady used for comic relief! Thanks but no thanks, if I wanna see that I'll watch some cartoons. You've got another character, who stole the show acting wise, playing the bagger. But guess what, he's the most intelligent one in the store, not to mention he won states in a target shooting contest. See where I'm going? It's like that.I don't want to complain all day about the CGI, or the lack of scares, or the lack of creatures (again, bugs and flying things we've all seen before) but it's so damn tough not to. I was incredibly letdown, and if you're a serious fan of horror, you should see this flick as nothing special. It's just a completely average affair. But for a wide-ranging audience, I think it'll fit the bill. Nice job Hollywood you did it again! When creature movies are done wrong, they're done very wrong. I think I'll pop in The Thing later on.....now that will deliver everything this movie lacked. And the funny thing is, in the beginning of the movie, you see a painting of The Thing.",4,12,24,21 November 2007
I Am Legend," Better than The Omega Man.
","Before going to see I Am Legend I decided to go back in time to watch The Omega Man, to see exactly what this story is all about, and to then compare the two when I see the new version. I also found out that there's another one entitled The Last Man on Earth, starring Vincent Price. Still haven't seen that one yet. I didn't really enjoy The Omega Man due to a high level of 'cheese'. Though the story is interesting, and there were some cool scenes like sniping the bad guys from the apartment, but overall it's really not that great of a movie. Unfortunately I Am Legend isn't great either, but it is better than The Omega Man. I'm not going to go into the differences between the two films, but let's say they should have shared ideas with each other. Well, I do have to say this, in Omega Man, the mutants known as The Family, talked and communicated. In I Am Legend, they're just screaming maniacs led by a slightly more intelligent screaming maniac. I really do believe this could have been much better if they kept the maniacs as crazy/violent, but also added more depth....at least some talking. Instead we just got a bunch of crazies....which we've all seen before. But I Am Legend still did well with these maniacs. They were ferocious and pretty much unstoppable. The first 3/4 of the film was interesting character development mixed with tension and some pretty emotional scenes. But the last quarter of the film just kinda didn't do anything for me. Maybe because I didn't care for the actress...or the ending for that matter, since it was a little too happy feeling. If you know the story, you should understand what I mean. Anyways, the film wasn't bad at all, it moved at a pretty good pace, Will Smith did a nice job, and there were some truly touching and tense scenes.",7,1,4,14 December 2007
Gran Torino," Grandpa Torino
","The plot of the story you most likely know so I'll skip that and just give you my 2 measly cents.Clint's latest flick of self-change, bravery and having an open mind is definitely another solid flick from this phenom of an actor/director. Gran Torino isn't perfect like his past pictures like Million Dollar Baby or Letters and Flag, but it succeeds like those do in giving messages.The film's really only gripe is the acting by the Hmong characters. I don't know why exactly that they all seemed to have zero acting experience but I'm sure Clint had a hand in that. Probably to make the movie seem more authentic he chose non-actors to be casted. And actually it works if you think about it that way. It's a guess, but it really seems that was the case.The story and the message he was delivering to people his own age is what stood out for me. I can't count how many times I've seen old timers be flat out racist or just express themselves as if the problems they were plagued by years and years ago are still a legit reason to be crotchety today. Stubbornness, narrow-minded ideals are major issues with war vets and children of the years past. It's obvious this will most likely be an ever-present problem but with Clint's celebrity and his loyal following of people who grew up with him, I'm sure it'll sink in some of these old farts heads that this is the sure way to think. Even for a young guy like myself I take these lessons displayed and try to keep my mind from becoming close-minded.So next time I hit up the local dive bar, the YMCA or anywhere for that matter and I hear a disgruntled old poop talk about his 30+ year issues, I'll tell him/her to watch Gran Torino. Then they'll probably tell me they don't watch movies.....",8,4,10,10 January 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," More Disappointment For Die-Hard Comic Fans
","Slight Spoilers First off, for all of you that enjoyed this. Fantastic! I can see why...a little. But when you're a die-hard Silver Surfer/Galactus fan, or even comic book fan for that matter, the movie disappoints too much.FFandTRofSS is a perfect sequel to the first one. Same average/Hollywood acting, nice special effects, and weak writing. And like the first one, the people in charge decided to not follow the comics. And yet again, I'm left shaking my head. Why did they make the Silver Surfer dependant to his board? Why did they ruin the anticipation for the Super Skrull in case he shows up in a future film? Why not show Galactus? They probably would have saved money since his craft is just a huge orb. Why make Alicia Masters black? For real lovers of comic-book writing, there's just too much being changed.But if you know nothing of the Silver Surfer/Galactus or Dr. Doom, or comics at all, you will most likely enjoy this film. It's popcorn movie madness.",6,5,11,15 June 2007
The Evil Dead," No budget, no problem.
","The Evil Dead is one of those films that will stand the test of time on many levels; special effects(crude but vicious), shock value and controversy, acting, directing, and music. Each of these traits, along with very nice pacing and suspense keeps the original ED leagues above the filler that Hollywood regurgitates every year. Bruce Campbell, the every man's man, stars as Ashley Williams, a guy who decides to bring his girlfriend and some other pals to a remote cabin in the woods for some rest and relaxation. Through some bad luck, demons are evoked from an ancient slumber and begin to wreak havoc among the group; pitting friends against friends, and then eventually, everyone against Ash. The acting is great, especially by said Campbell, whose square jaw and rubber face ensure him as the horror genre's Jim Carrey. Sam Raimi's film is a compilation of stop-motion gore, claustrophobic terror, and innovative camera angles, and realistically, never has someone done so much for the genre with so little. Of course The Blair Witch Project was well done, but it hasn't had the success and constant imitations that Raimi's little film has. A fun time all around, especially for movie goers who aren't afraid of a little blood and hurt. It's a cult classic, but with such huge notoriety and fame, this film has evolved into mainstream status. And for good reason.",9,6,9,13 June 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Just spectacular...
","Quentin Tarantino has made an amazing movie with Kill Bill, and for me, has surpassed the likes of his earlier masterpieces, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  I can't give this film high enough praise for it's wonderful homage to violence and the kung fu genre.  Each scene has its own personality, and every slash of the sword made my smile bigger.  It was almost like watching a live action anime movie, it was that incredible.  Uma Thurman is great, and I was never really a huge fan before this.  Jeez...movie experiences just don't get too much better.  There was enough style in this movie to feed a continent!  I can't wait for Kill Bill 2, because things are gonna go down that I do not want to miss!  I used to be skeptical to the lady hero, but after seeing this film, I'm a different man.  Oscars all around!  Why not?!!  This movie was just too good to be true for a fan of action films or martial art flicks!  Unbelievable, plain and simple.Ten out of ten...big time!!!",10,1,3,12 October 2003
Paranormal Activity," I would've been on Montel in a heart-beat!
","I'm just gonna keep this simple. The flick revolves around a couple who are suffering from some....paranormal activity. And obviously, the....paranormal activity keeps getting worse and worse. The flick overall is a pretty gripping experience. You're constantly wondering what type of scary dealy is gonna go down next, and that mixed with the setting of a night-time bedroom being the main area where the haunts are going down, it makes the horror that much more intense. Unfortunately the flick suffered a wee bit from stupid-ass decision making, and an arguably weak ending. Honestly, with the decision making, I would have been screaming bloody murder from the roof-tops if even a tenth of what was happening to them was happening to me. I'd be on Oprah, Jenny Jones, Donahue...all the talk-shows in a heart-beat. And with the ending, I was seriously hoping for something truly horrific to be shown, but instead it's played in a not-surprising type way. Also due to how the movie plays out and concludes, the film doesn't have very high replay value either. But it's without a doubt a recommendable film that succeeds in building tension like few others.",8,2,5,19 October 2009
Big Fish," fun, fishy stuff!
","I was more than excited when I heard Tim Burton's next film was to be coming out in mere months, and when it finally did, I was not let down.  It has what every Burton movie has to offer, a cool script, good acting, good music, great direction and a ridiculous attention to detail and atmosphere! The film is loaded with creativity and awesome visuals, and Mr. Trainspotting is hilarious!  Every time he smiles, he made me do the exact same.  The end is great and the overall message of the film is to do as much as possible, be nice to everyone, and to always have a great time!  That's not always possible, but Burton sure makes you want to try! 9/10",8,0,0,26 April 2004
Grindhouse," Bubbly Melty Violence & Talky Girls = Grindhouse
","I'll split the review up since Grindhouse isn't one movie. It's two! Double Feature Time Baby!I'll start with Rodriguez's Terror Planet. You have many known actors in this film, including Bruce '10 Inches' Willis, Rose 'No Nudity Anymore' McGowan, the tiny Freddy Rodriguez and the wise Josh Brolin, who plays his role as Doc Block the best. I'll simply tell you that it's a zombie/disease/sicko flick where an outbreak is taking place and people are rapidly turning into bubbly, pus-spewing maniacs. And let me tell you, the effects in this movie are awesome. Bubbly, melty flesh, head explosions/decapitations, hundreds of guns blasts....the movie is chock full of violence that any action/horror fan should dig. Unfortunately for me that is pretty much the only outstanding aspect of the film. The film feels very Hollywood and not very 'Grindhouse' exploitative. You have some corny writing, some hard to believe moments (minor grievance) some over-the-top acting, which works, but most of the time doesn't. But how many people are focusing on acting anyways. Well I am, but you're probably not, since you're some type of retard. Anyways, to summarize Terror Planet up, it's a pretty nice time. If this flick didn't have such a plethora of unbelievable effects, it'd be tough to recommend, but it does, so I do, and it was good, so there.Death Proof on the other hand is one of the most inconsistent flicks I've seen in a long time. Where Terror Planet had great violence mixed with care-less characters almost all the way through, Death Proof has care-less characters that talk you to death through cliché, rapid-fire banter too much of the time. It's very Tarantino-esquire, but it's not at the same time. Reason why I say this, is because I've enjoyed Quentin's dialogue's in the past. But this was almost ridiculous. Too further whine, the character played by Traci Thoms, was too much to take. Her cliché ridden character was so sh!tty and annoying it took my erection away.....you've got to see the tail in this flick. Phewy. Anyways, the mix of her acting/delivery and the 'too cool' writing didn't work for me in the slightest. But I feel most people will eat this up, since she was so dedicated in her acting. Thank goodness Stuntman Mike, Kurt Russell's character is in this movie. Kurt's delivery in this movie is awesome, he plays the suave, badass ex-stuntman who's sick and tired of not getting laid. That's bad news for the first set of ladies that we met, who are again struck by the annoying bug, but not as much as the second group of hens. When Death Proof has Kurt on the screen it becomes a fantastic flick, but when he's absent it struggles to keep it's motor running, thanks to the motor-mouth babes. Maybe that's what they should have called it instead of Death Proof, Motor-Mouth Babes Meets Stuntman Mike....nah. Again, consistency issues arise and even the awesome character of Russell changes gears and you're left with a pretty abrupt and average ending....I almost said Empty Tank. But Death Proof, just like Terror Planet, has incredibly scenes (gotta give the nod to Zoe 'She-Ra' Bell) and not so incredibly scenes. But again like TP, it ends up with some damage, but nothing that'll stop me from recommending it. Grindhouse is different, unique, and one cool production...but, sometimes too cool for it's own good. You have two great directors who made two movies, that will be eaten up by the masses, one reason because it's unlike anything they've seen. And you got to take your hats off to them for at least making an attempt to pay homage to classic grindhouse flicks. I say keep it up, but next time, less comedy and more grit!Terror Planet - 8 Death Proof - 7.5 Grindhouse - 8",8,2,8,11 April 2007
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," 120 Days of Sodom or bust!
","Time and time again, Salo is always on people's Most Disturbing movies list. Finally I took the time out to get a hold of this flick and I can now see why people think this way.Salo is about a bunch of rich, smary and ultra-mega perverse and ultimately evil fascist weirdos who kidnap a bunch of young lovelies, male and female. Their sole goal, to completely fulfill their bizarre sexual fantasies. No spoiler here, they get their wish.Salo surprisingly to me, was a pretty well-made flick. It had (what-seemed to me) a size-able budget, good over-the-top acting, a unique setting, and overall it had a unsettling feeling over the entire film. Which I'm sure the huge, mansion situated in the (what seems) isolated country-side managed to help with this feeling.But unfortunately, the film was pretty tedious. At first I was pretty into the movie. I didn't know what was going on, and I kinda had hope for the young lovelies. The Fascist pervs were all uniquely bizarre and all had their own sick personality. But at the same time almost whenever they spoke it was some bullcrap philosophical blabbering that drove me to start thinking about when would they show nudity again. Though, some of the lines they delivered were thought-provoking and kinda funny. 'Nothing's worse than a breath without odor.' Haha, yeah, okay.Also, Evol666 warned me that the Old Prostitutes would be boring. I didn't want to believe him since I thought that had a lot of potential. At first it was alright, but ultimately like almost everything else this movie delivers began to bore and grow tiresome.Nevertheless, for a good amount of the movie I was entertained. By the ridiculously high sexual content and the oodles of boobs and bums, to the overall absurdity of the story, I was enjoying it. But like I said, the movie begins to wear down the viewer and it ends up only being a flick to watch for the extreme factor. Which actually was the only reason I sought out this film.",8,3,6,16 September 2008
Pulp Fiction," What else can be said?
","Tarantino's first huge film is PULP FICTION, a profane, multi-layered, character driven explosion of philosophizing hit men, drug overdoses, and leather bound gimps. Despite its long running time, this mash of story and action is nearly nil of bore and continually entertains with every viewing.Sam Jackson, arguably, has never been better; Travolta, ditto; Uma is good as always; Rhames, nearly mythical; Stoltz manages to make a drug dealer look like kind; Amanda Plummer is crazy; Keitel, calmly imposing; Alexis Arquette was still Robert Arquette; Bruce Willis, great as always.When it came out in the theaters, it was evident that Tarantino had created something like nothing else, and more than a decade later, scores of awful filmmakers still try to emulate this film's cool and fluid chaos.It's not my favorite Tarantino flick, but I won't argue if someone states that it's his best.",10,0,1,13 November 2007
The Happening," Where's Captain Planet when you need him? Lazy bum!
","So what can we expect from Night's first R-rated outing? Meh, really not that much. Just like his past couple, Night's films are really beginning to be pretty damn weak. And with his latest flick, The Happening, which sounds like a Bentley Little book (only if), you're given the same Night treatment. A movie that works and doesn't work all at the same damn time.In The Happening you got people killing themselves due to a supposed neuro-toxin that the plants are dishing out. Why? Because we're not treating Mother Earth so nice. Well, that's one theory. The idea is kinda cool, revenge of Mother Nature. But when you can predict what's going on, by the oh-so obvious direction (cue mysterious music with gloomy shot of swaying trees) the movie immediately becomes an adventure flick instead of some sort of mystery. So, about 20 minutes in, I get the jist and the only thing I slightly care about is how they're gonna stay alive. The way the movie played out was okay enough, I guess, but the writing and acting by all involved, minus Leguizamo and the slack-jawed dude from O'Brother, were laughable and completely overly dramatic. Marky Mark....why is he so damn breathy in all his friggin flicks? If his character isn't abrasive, forget it. The writing, God the writing. I don't know what's going on here, but if anyone truly thinks this is professional stuff, go to the zoo and jump in the lion cage. And what a stupid scene that was......was that guy made of jello? Arms do not pop off that easily. Ugh....The Happening's good aspects is the production value. It's a great looking and sounding film. But the story, writing, acting, and even direction is all average to weak. With barely anything interesting or shocking happening after the first 20 minutes, the movie just pulls you along for an average, uneventful feeling ride. Go see it if you're a M.Night Fanboy or you're easily impressed.",5,2,8,13 June 2008
The Departed," Good Faahking Movie!
","Phewy, we got a movie here. You have a star-studded cast, big named director, more swears than Goodfellas (kidding), some great violence...what a good flick.This movie is about the involvement of 'rats' in Boston police and Boston Irish mafia. Like I said before, almost everyone in the movie is a big name....so they are all willing to display their best acting. Unbelievably everyone brings it. Fantastic acting. Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg were my favorites in this one.The story itself is great also. Taking the story from a Chinese movie called Infernal Affairs, but mixing in Boston Irish Mob history.The movie is pretty long, but what do you expect from Scorcese. Gangs of New York went on forever...thank God for Daniel Day Lewis. But I only say this due to the fact my knees hurt, and I need to stretch them every so often. Forgetting that, the movie moves at a pretty fast clip.It's flat out one of the best crime movies ever made, and definitely one of the best movies this year. I would say this and Flags of Our Father are the top two. If you like smart, gritty, well acted flicks you'll most likely love this baby.",9,1,2,22 October 2006
30 Days of Night," Screeching vampires get old....
","I have been a '30 days' fan for a while now, as well as a fan of Steve Niles who consistently writes entertaining horror comics; needless to say, I was very much stoked to see this film. Of course though, i did catch wind of some reviews and was forewarned that this may be a vampyrrhic meltdown...and in some cases it was.Josh Hartnett plays the lead Eben, not Evan, who is having relationship issues with his wife Stella, played by the too pretty to be taken seriously Melissa George, and as they are about to smooth things over, a stranger comes to town with some foreboding news. It's not soon after this that Eben, his bro, his pothead granny, Stella, and a few other miscreants are running and hiding from a gang of Russian(?) nosferatus. The blood flows pretty well in the film, as does the action, but there were a few times where I had to laugh and shake my head at some of the cliché plot turns/characters, ex: the old man who misses his dead wife and the worrisome guy who doesn't know how to shut the hell up!!! But the film had some nice direction from the HARD CANDY guy, and Josh Hartnett was actually pretty good. Its kind of fun to watch him lose his sanity.But the film is saved by Danny Huston. He doesn't say much verbally in the film but his mouth and looks do a lot of talking on their own. He owns the film as the head vamp, with icy dead stares and a menacing gait, but the same cannot can be said about the rest of the bloodsuckers. They twist their heads constantly feeding like seizure victims, always show off their teeth to ill and un-scary effect, and do not stop screeching!!! Ever. Why do vampires need to screech? Ugh. So all in all, nice cinematography at times(great shot of one bloody town), okay gore, bad ending, and too much screeching. I give it a wicked generous and lucky number sleven.",7,5,12,20 October 2007
There Will Be Blood," Paul Thomas Anderson's Absolute Best Film.
","Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's OIL!, Paul Thomas Anderson has created a character study about greed, fortune, and the abominable ways the human spirit can persevere.Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing as Daniel Plainview, a miner turned oil man, whose singular goal in life is to make as much money as possible. He inherits a child, raises the boy as his own, and uses the boy's sweet face to sell his business and expand his riches.Paul Dano of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE fame plays Paul/Eli Sunday; two characters in one, depending on your own view, who tells the booming and notorious Plainview of some latent oil on his family's land. Once a bargain is set, Plainview and his young son, H.W., set out to find this acreage, and upon discovering it, make even more dealings with the Sunday family.With the new income and Plainview's ceaseless money, Eli Sunday plans on building his own church, spreading the good word, and escalating his own name into a seat of power. But Plainview sees something in Sunday that no one else does, and soon makes clear that no one but himself is in charge.With negotiations done, the well is sprung, men are brought in from all over, and Plainview has yet another vast property with an 'ocean of oil' beneath it. But when an unfortunate event arises, Plainview's contempt for his fellow man becomes clearer with each scene, and his free fall into madness accelerates.TWBB has a variety of memorable scenes with DDL stealing every shot he is in; from his encounters with long lost relatives, corporate heads, or simple townsfolk, Plainview is a man who purposely lives his life through fraudulence, intimidating and outsmarting people with each crooked step he takes.Dano and DDL met on the set of THE BALLAD OF JACK AND ROSE, and it is very obvious, due to the sheer physicality of their on screen relationship, that their friendship and acting compatibility is one of the best to date.An explosive and intense film with stellar acting, music (Jonny Greenwood) and direction; made by a myriad of expert filmmakers.",9,3,11,14 January 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Beer and Aspirin = Bad Gas
","Minor, Minor Spoilers About Beginning*******Going into The Last King of Scotland I only knew of one thing, and that's that Forest is supposed to be unbelievable as the Ex-Ugandan President Idi Amin Dada Oumee. And boy was he! I've seen him in tons of movies, but this is definitely his best role to date.The movie is about a young Scottish doctor, Nicholas, who decides to experience life a little more and venture off to help and make a difference in another part of the world. He spins a globe and ends up choosing Canada...he spins again and lands on Uganda. For a smart doctor he should have researched what this country was going through before heading over there...but hey, I guess he was really looking for an adventure. And he gets it. After working at a small village hospital, his services are surprisingly needed by the big honcho himself, Amin. Doctor Nick helps him out and at the same time befriends the incredibly power-hungry yet charismatic president. Amin asks/tells Nicholas, that he's is needed by his side. Nick slowly agrees and from that moment on, Nick and Amin become the best of friends and live happily ever after...or Nick eventually sees the truth behind Amins' eyes and has realized he's entered a much too dangerous world.The Last King of Scotland is fast-paced and led by Forest's awesome performance of Amin. It's such a scene-stealing performance, I didn't care much about the other characters until pretty much the end of the movie. But don't get me wrong, they are all good performances...truthfully nothing special, but the main reason you're seeing this movie is to witness one actor working at his finest. When you add in fine supporting actors, a well written story that keeps you glued to your seat and a shot of Kerry Washington's bum, you have yourself one of the best movies of the year. If you enjoy movies as a whole you should definitely check out The Last King of Scotland. 9 outta 10",9,3,4,30 January 2007
American Gangster," 'My Man'
","Ridley Scott's new flick American Gangster was a good one. Though Im not gonna be saying it's the best film of the year or anything like that. It was directed well, barely any dull scenes, great acting by an enormous cast and was really well-written. Unfortunately the story never seemed 'new' to me. I was reminded of other drug-related/crime movies, like BLOW, CITY OF GOD, and evening TRAINING DAY.....'My Man'. Though it's in the leagues as being entertaining as the above mentioned movies, it really just never felt like I was watching a 'new' story. But speaking of story, I never knew anything about Frank Lucas, and his story is fantastic. A black man who was more influential than his Mafian brethren? Tell me you're kidding. Nope, he was a force in Harlem back in the late 60s and early 70s and barely anyone knows about it. But for me this area of the film was the only stand out part. Sure there are other good scenes, done well, but nothing worth mentioning. Well, scratch that, naked women workin in a drug lab was an eye-opening scene.Denzel Washington won the Oscar when he portrayed the crooked cop in Training Day who said 'My Man' all the time. Well, in the American Gangster you got him saying this line again, and by God does he have it down. There are scenes when you know he's gonna say it, and he still pulls it off incredibly well. Denzel is one actor you really never have to worry about it in the acting department. You've got Russell 'Mr. Oscar' Crowe playing the other lead, and like always, he always has the character down. He was great in this flick, the accent, the mannerisms, all of it. Though, his character's story was interesting in that he was in charge of the case to figure out who the big boy druglords were, his side story with his wife was for me the 'dull' parts of the film. They were well-acted and all that, but mostly, it was just character development that isn't needed. Russell Crowe's good enough an actor to portray a struggling cop without a family problem. And also let me say Josh Brolin as the crooked cop was great. I didn't need a side-story of him doing tons of drugs and banging prostitutes....but ya know he was doing it.American Gangster was a really good flick. It had amazing acting mixed with scenes that shed a new light on drug-trafficking....or should I say Old light. Though since there are so many other drug/crime cop films out there it seems a little been there done that. But don't let that sway you if you enjoy good movies and or crime films. And also, Frank Lucas is one hell of an interesting personality. My man. 8.5 outta 10",9,305,406,28 October 2007
Hancock," Hancock....more like Foovagina.
","When July 4th comes rolling around you know what that means: Will Smith time! From Independence Day to Men in Black 2 (saw those on or around the 4th), if you're ever in the need for a big blockbuster flick, have no fear because Will Smith is here. Sure this is a super-hero based flick, but that doesn't mean it's going to be super.Story revolves around Hancock becoming a better person and an even better super-hero. Gee, I wonder if he does become better? Duuuuhhh! Anywho, throw in another side-plot with another super-hero and you basically have the flick.My biggest gripe with this flick is it strays away from the emotionally weak and crude Hancock and introduces this other super-hero relationship. Can't their be any super-hero flicks that don't involve some type of lovey-dovey type dealy? I was diggin the beginning, where he was a drunk fumbling hero and had not a care in the world. It seriously made for some unique and fun entertainment. After the new introduction, it became this melodramatic, poorly written flick.Overall though, it wasn't a bad flick because the beginning was good, but for the last 30+ minutes, it just became a little 'been there done that' feeling. This movie would have been great if he stayed a drunk the entire time. But oh well. Not bad for a summer movie, but a good entry into a bin of average super-hero flicks. Right ahead of Constantine and behind Howard the Duck.Oh, it may have the record for the most use of the word 'a$$hole' in a PG-13 flick. That's a good thing.",5,2,7,2 July 2008
WALL·E," Johnny 5 would be very proud of his little bro.
","It's so clear. So painfully clear that Pixar Studios are making the absolute best movies out there. Each and every time I see a one of their new movies, I come out of it with such a happy and vibrant feeling. And with Wall-E, the results are the same. Maybe even more so.Wall-E is about a little trash compacting and collecting robot whose sole directive is to clean up Earth. And I'll tell you something, he's fantastic at his job. With his little cockroach pal at his side, the two are the only living and functioning things on planet Earth. One day while Wall-E's about to finish up work, a rocket ship lands, and out emerges an impressive little white robot whose purpose is to search for vegetation. What follows from their initial and humorous meetings is what great stories are made of.Wall-E is superb film-making and story-telling at the family level. Hell, it's fantastic on all levels. With humor, emotion and adventure ruling the day, this Pixar gem surely is a must-see film. I know these Pixar films may seem kiddie, but this is pure family gold. Adults will laugh at the satire and be re-energized by the genuine love story. If I'm not making myself clear, this is an unbelievable flick. And if you have any spare time, go out and see Wall-E. It's perfect entertainment.",10,3,8,27 June 2008
Never Back Down," Kick! Punch! It's all in the mind. If you wanna test me I'm sure you'll find, the things I teach ya are sure to beat ya, nevertheless get a lesson from teacher.....
","Hiyah! Never Back Down as a MMA movie is weak, flat out. For anyone who's done any sort of MMA training and has decent taste in movies, you should easily realize this is just MMA MTV style. There's nothing about it. Show hot chicks, show flashy cars, show lubed up dudes, and the melodramatic back stories that everyone is pretty much bored with by now.The movie isn't completely awful, the dude who plays the 'badboy' actually has some decent charisma. He reminded me of Paul Walker and Brad Pitt combined. Obviously Djimon(sp?) can act, so that's no surprise, but one thing he can't do is fight. His form was very amateur. And that's another thing that was poorly done with this film; the training for the actors. The kicks for our acting stars were beyond bad. Whoever trained the stand-up for this movie should be laughed at. I can't really make fun of the grappling, since the editing was so ridiculously fast. One second no submission, the next a knee bar...what? Huh? With what I said above with how flashy it is, it's by far the biggest reason you'll keep watching. Not a single person is ugly in this movie, not a crappy car is seen in sight, and I think I saw a dog take a turd that was CGI'd with 'bling' on it....I think. I was hoping it'd be so bad that MST3K would one day bash on it, and maybe they will, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's just a movie that was made for the MMA craze, predictable and hip as humanly possible. Check out Red Belt instead.",4,0,1,20 August 2008
Halloween," One Crazy White Boy
","After years and years of hesitance, I succumbed to the urge, the power that is Halloween. I've been a 'hater' of Halloween for no good reason besides disliking what he looks like. I've always just preferred Freddy and Jason...they look 'cooler', and still do actually. But, last night I grew up, I became a man. I watched Halloween. And I feel like a total bum loser for not seeing it earlier.Halloween is the story of a young, emotionless, troubled boy named Michael Myers, who kills his sister on Halloween night. He is locked away in a mental asylum for many years, but during those years he planned his escape and is now on the loose. He returns to his old neighborhood and begins where he left off. The movie is a classic through and through. Halloween shines brightest through Myers. The way they use him - sneaking and following around. His slow movement and his calm demeanor when on screen are pretty eerie. How they used him in shadows. Halloween was shot incredibly well, and that is where you get most of the scares. The music also plays a part in the scares but it can't compare to how Myers is portrayed. The movie itself isn't perfect. There's somewhat unrealistic death scenes, a little corny acting by the younger actors, but these are minor grievances. At 90 minutes, Halloween doesn't bore you, but tricks and treats you.I never really believed Halloween belonged next to Freddy and Jason as horror icons, but not only does he belong there, he's most likely the most evil. Great flick, great story, great cinematography and most importantly a great character. I'm now proud to be considered a fan of Halloween.",9,2,4,26 October 2006
Mary and Max," The Marvelous Mary and Max
","Simple and blunt, the 2009 animated flick, Mary and Max, is a fantastic film and cinematic accomplishment. A beautiful, funny and touching story that delivers on all fronts of meaningful film-making.In comparable style to Wallace and Gromit, the film uses it's charming and silly style to great effect by relating two unique characters. A middle-aged man with social disabilites named Max Jerry Horovitz receives a letter one day from an inquisitive little Australian girl named Mary Daisy Dinkle. The two via letters relate to one another instantly, and an amazing bond of friendship begins.About 2 hours ago I finished watching this flick and I'm still beaming. It's really a special, special film that just screams perfection. I feel bad for the people who'll look at the cover and dismiss it due to being animated, as this will most undoubtedly happen. But lucky for me and you, huh?",10,11,20,9 December 2009
Iron Man," Seinfeld was right.
","So George was wrong. Tony Stark does wear clothing under the armor. I always hoped he was naked. Oh well.Iron Man was a weird time. I enjoyed it overall quite a bit, but there were moments when I just didn't give a damn. My issues are minor, but for nit-picking semi-comic book nerds, they are just. My earlier comic book experiences with Tony Stark gave me a completely different impression. Stark is more of a gentleman like character. And though Downey had to include his attitude into the role, it still worked. One thing I did not care for in the slightest was the News Reporter gal. Her role was annoying (I get it), much too distracting and just a weak part of the script. And she never got her 'come-up-ins'. Stupid chick even interrupted when she wasn't supposed to! She should have been booted outta there! There were a couple talky parts, I suppose to add depth to the friendships, but overall they were just boring and felt unneeded. Again, minor issues that don't take anything away from the main aspects to the film.But the action, special effects and acting by Downey and Bridges were all really good. Actually it may have the best effects I've seen yet in a super hero movie. But ya can't forget about the effects in Howard the Duck. And Favreau did a decent enough job as well. Overall, this should be a really fun on-going Marvel movies series. If you want an entertaining, great looking action flick, look no further.",8,6,14,7 May 2008
Beowulf," Poor Grendel
","Robert Zemeckis has done a respectable job with his version of the oldest tale in literature, BEOWULF, the legendary story of one man who would rid kingdoms all over of the most heinous and foreboding evil. I truly wish however that his telling would have remained accurate, and not been produced as a Hollywood spectacle. But with all that aside, BEOWULF was no slouch.The story is simple: a giant monster attacks King Hrothgar's hall, killing nearly all his men, and Beowulf and his rugged brutes come to his aid. One or two subplots are noticeable, but they really don't matter since the story never firmly holds true to its source. There are huge monsters and huge cleavage abound, and truly this is what makes Beowulf memorable, though the needless cleavage and sexually driven female characters take away from the film's stoic nature.If I was to see this film again, it would be for a couple reasons, and no, not to see Angelina Jolie covered in gold again(which was pretty nice to look at), but rather for the incredible finale with a towering golden dragon, one of the best in the history of cinema, and the stirring, incredible and emotional performance of Crispin Glover as Grendel.Grendel's pain and inability to live in a world that wouldn't see him otherwise was the best attribute of the film, and I found myself stricken as the poor beast was brutally cast down. The voice Glover lends is filled with so much realism and heart, that the anti-hero that Grendel soon becomes is hopelessly taken away far too early. Aside from the dragon, Robert Zemeckis hit Grendel's pitiable nature perfectly.Andy Serkis has done a lot for voice/motion actors, and Glover has successfully carried the torch. I can only wonder how such inspired acting can go unnoticed by the film community.BEOWULF as a film is very entertaining with some immense action, but as far as gore and nudity, there are hardly any. Some bare butts, some pus and blood, a good amount of brutality, Jolie could be nude, but are breasts truly breasts without nipples? Definitely worth seeing for the action and Glover's fine performance.",8,1,5,21 November 2007
300," Blood splatter, freaks, and swords: The Holy Trinity
","300 came and went, and all in all, I was definitely satisfied. The hype was enormous, more than any other film so far this year, and though it partially lived up to it, sadly enough, it never exceeded it.The plot is simple: 300 Spartans, carved from stone, defend their beloved oceanside country from thousands of marauding foreigners, all the while dual corruption by council heads deny the Spartans and their valiant leader any back-up. Gerard Butler, or perhaps more fitting, Gerard 'Cut'ler, owns this film in every ab-clenching, neck-slicing, cliché-touting, excess and aspect this film has to gorgeously cram in your eye cavities, and his 299 counterparts, bronze and brawn from every conceivable angle, holler and follow his march with gusto, brandishing scarlet capes that flow like the blood dripping from their battle spears.The action is huge, the effects are great, and the acting fitting. Zach Snyder directed the film with some very nice touches, most of them involving wide shots of arrows pouring down from the heavens, and other longer sequences involving Leonidas(Butler) ripping enemies apart with an utmost ease. But a lot of the film seemed to, most likely through complete accident, copy the film that seems to be the end-all for every historical action film to come, GLADIATOR. A part of the film I didn't care for was the fact that it was filled with war propaganda. Fight for your country, live for glory, and so on. In these current times, it is so easy for this usually righteous sentiment to be taken wrong, and in this movie, it's very easy....Hoo-Rah!But for all it's downfalls, which aren't many, this film is really fun to watch. It's loaded with great make-up, nice cinematography from start to finish, a heard-it-all-before musical score, and 300 extremely jacked men who aren't going anywhere till every last Persian is dead. It was great, in a subtle kind of way, but would've benefited most if it wasn't advertised so incessantly. Perhaps, the perfect example of over hype.",4,3,9,9 March 2007
Pineapple Express," Made me miss smoking. That's a good thing!
","How do you know when a Stoner Comedy is good? When you want to be high while watching it. It's that simple. Like any other fantastic weed flick, like Up In Smoke, Next Movie, or Half Baked, these are films you want to be high when watching. It's a movie like Pineapple Express that can make an ex-smoker become a smoker again.Seth Rogen's character accidentally witnesses a murder. He seeks shelter with his dealer, who is James Franco's character. They're on the run, paranoid to extreme levels and completely high the entire time. So obviously funny sh!t is going down almost nonstop. Throw in some action (tons at the end), memorable supporting cast (the black dude from the Office is very good here), loads of smoking and a top heavy Rosie Perez (and if she showed her boobs, this would have been an INSTANT classic), you have yourself a very entertaining flick.I do have to say though, there is one star in this movie that completely shines brighter than the rest. James Franco was friggin great in this flick. It was by far one of the most likable characters I've ever seen on film. Just a silly, genuine performance. I'm not sure how good this flick would have been if he wasn't casted in it. Nevertheless he was and he made it awesome.Pineapple Express, if you don't know is the name of the weed they smoke in the flick. And, I'll tell you what, I wish I had some Pineapple Express while watching this. A tad long during the end, but still fun and definitely one of the best comedies in a while. It's just a damn shame Rosie didn't show us her boobs. That would have been so damn great.....looks like I'm gonna watch White Men Can't Jump tonight.",8,4,9,13 August 2008
Beetlejuice," Michael Keaton at his best.
","BEETLE JUICE is one of the funniest and most odd 'family' films ever to have been made. There are pretty awesome special effects at work (sand worms, Beetle Snake, and a scene where Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin compete to see who can make a scarier face), tons of make-up, some legitimately eerie moments, and a hilarious performance by Keaton as the troublesome everyman ghost, Beetle Juice.Classic Tim Burton combining humor and scares, the morbid and the silly, and the bizarre visual flair we've all come to know and love. Danny Elfman, as usual, makes the film sound just right, and Harry Belafonte's 'Banana Boat Song' is used perfectly. Twice.There's some blood and some creepy stuff going around: plenty of dead bodies(mostly doing and saying funny stuff) with all sorts of ailments, constant talk of the afterlife, some risqué jokes that will most likely go over the brow of your ten year old, and one of the best usages of the 'F' word in cinema history.Everything about the film is exceptional, and if you like your horror with some humor, look no further.",9,4,6,5 December 2007
Evil Dead II," Slapstick horror at its finest!
","The sequel to 'The Evil Dead' has arrived in 'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn!' The plot is practically the same; Ash is attacked, his girlfriend killed and everyone else gets slaughtered...is that a spoiler? Nah, because this is what Evil Dead films are...a showcase for Bruce Campbell to get the s*** knocked out of him! So even though the formula is the same, how is this film so much fun, and perhaps, arguably, better than the original? Well, the budget has been anted up from ten bucks to fifty bucks and the film, unlike the original which tried harder to be an actual horror movie, is a laugh riot! Albeit dark humor, there are several scenes with Ash losing his sanity before our eyes that are just hilarious. If there was one drawback: not enough gore. But all in all, ED2 is great entertainment that has plenty of awesome camera angles, great one-liners, a severed hand, and touches of horror and comedy mixed to perfection! Thank you Sam Raimi, Bob Tapert and Bruce Campbell.",10,1,2,14 June 2007
