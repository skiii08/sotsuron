Hereditary," Unsettling
","This film is very well done. The cinemotography was done exquisitely, as every shot is well composed and very pleasing to look at. The acting, especially from Alex Wolff, Toni Collette, and Milly Shapiro are all fantastic. For a directorial debut, the film knocks it out of the park. I would consider the majority of this film to play out like a psychological thriller, as most of it is suspense being built up. Near the end of the third act is when things truly get scary. There are a lot of memorable and unsettling scenes throughout the film, and I thoroughly enjoyed every part of it right up until the ending. I won't spoil it for you, as I feel you should go into this film knowing as little as possible, but it felt like the entire movie was original and different right up until the end when it turned into something I felt like I had seen before. Regardless, this is a very well done and captivating movie that I urge you to go see.",7,4,10,10 June 2018
Deadpool 2," Severely DIssapointed
","I genuinely did not enjoy this movie. Coming from someone who thought the first Deadpool was very good, I thought this one was far worse. I recall laughing only 3-4 times, as the comedy was poorly written and unfunny. Simply having Ryan Reynolds break the fourth wall to acknowledge the fact that the writing is 'lazy', does not make it ok for the writing to be lazy. I also feel the action was far worse in this film compared to the first one, with there being far too many cuts for an audience member to follow what's happening. Overall I feel every aspect of this movie was done worse than the first one. I frankly wouldn't reccomend it, as I was bored, unamused, and am already forgetting what happened throughout the film. Unless you're a hardcore Marvel fan, I see no point in spending your money to go and see this movie.",3,81,193,19 May 2018
A Quiet Place," Very Impressed
","A Quiet Place is a great horror film. This is one of the most genuinely scary horror movies that has come out in a very long time. It seems to be third time's the charm for John Krasinski in the director's chair, as he truly hit this one out of the park. Not only are the horror scenes some of the best I have seen in recent memory, but you actually care and feel for the characters. John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are both fantastic, and demonstarte a great on-screen chemistry, consdiering they are married in real life. The kids were pretty good as well, as long as they weren't talking, (I'll get to that in a minute). The film build tension incredibly well, and, I must reiterate, the horror in this movie is actually scary. A Quiet Place is not full of dumb and cheap jump scares, it provides real horror. The scares in this movie are earned through scenes full of tension and uneasiness that lead to the scare, they are not lazily thrown in throughout the film. The cinematogorphy is also very well done, with most of the shots in the film being interesting and captivating. But, as is usually the case, there are a few scenes in this movie that aren't very good. There is a scene where John Krasinski is talking to his son near a waterfall, and the entire conversation is a little cringy, because the kid is not a good actor when he has to talk. There are a couple other shots and scenes that annoyed me as well. I found the very last shot of the film to be a little clich√© and unneccesary, (but I won't spoil it for you). Overall, A Quiet Place is a genuinely scary film, filled with very good perfomances, great direction, a great story, and great cinemotography, make sure you check this one out.",7,3,6,8 April 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Great Film
","The Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic film that is a must see for anybody. It has one of the most intriguing and intersting stories of any film ever, and is well-directed, acted, and written. Everything about this film is fantastic.",10,0,1,20 February 2018
Black Panther," Don't Listen to the Hype
","Black Panther is really just another predictable and average Marvel movie. Most Marvel movies I find enjoyable to a certain extent, and would usually rate a 6 or 7/10, but this movie falls short. The characters are weak, the writing and story are quite bland, the acting is whatever, and Black Panther himself is meh. The entire movie is really just a whole bunch of average and boring series of events that follow the cookie cutter format of any other superhero movie. What makes this movie slightly worse than your average superhero movie, is that the humor is terrible and it takes itself far too seriously. We are even treated to a 'What are those?!' joke near the middle of the film. Overall, Black Panther is a slighlty below average film that you really don't have to watch. P.S. There is no meaningful political commentary in this film. Don't listen to the people that say there is.",4,7,12,20 February 2018
Goodfellas," Fantastic
","Goodfellas is one of the best crime movies of all time as I would rank it up there with The Godfather, even though the two are hars to compare. Scorsese's directing style is really what makes the film, with multiple long takes and the use of Scorsese's masterful framing, we feel what it is like to be a gangster. The perfromances are impeccable, with Deniro, Pesci, and Liotta giving some of the best perfroamces of the 90's. The story is incredibly well told and the fact that it is based off of a true story only makes it more interesting. I enjoy the narration done by Henry Hill and his wife Karen, as it gives us an inside look of what is going on in the characters' heads. The film shows the harshness of the mafia yet still manages to be funny in one of the best crime films ever made.",10,0,0,7 March 2018
