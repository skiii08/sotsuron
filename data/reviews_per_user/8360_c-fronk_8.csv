Casablanca," Casablanca
","I felt that I have always been familiar with the film Casablanca even though I recently watched it for the first time. It's just one of those things you hear a lot about throughout your life, but don't really get where people are coming from until you see it for yourself. Casablanca has something for everyone: action, drama, romance, etc. The movie itself is timeless. Rick is a strong, confident character and handles certain situations rather effortlessly. It's interesting to watch how everyone gravitates towards the character with a strong sense of independence. The characters are what really make the film. There is a perfect balance between humor and seriousness, and a mix between the good, the bad, and the morally gray. Many may find this film overrated, but regardless of one's opinion this film is a must watch.",8,0,1,2 March 2016
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","There's a lot of controversy over whether or not this really is one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. Citizen Kane was utterly fantastic regarding its technical aspects, and full of groundbreaking visuals. There were plenty of different and interesting camera angles being used. Every shot was meticulously planned, and the cinematography was outstanding. I really liked all the little lighting tricks, and the lighting really added to the atmosphere of the film. The editing was also interesting and really brought all the shots together. Welles managed to put together a complex story loaded with symbolism. It's understandable that many people find Citizen Kane boring, but the story is simply a slow build, and takes a little bit of patience on the viewer's part. It isn't my favorite film, but watching it was a great experience nonetheless.",Null,1,2,9 May 2016
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","This is yet another film I have been meaning to see for a long time. De Niro's performance is outstanding, powerful and intense, with great directing from Scorsese. The cinematography is beautiful, as is the lighting used throughout the film. Every character and performance is significant, and no one's screen time goes to waste. This is a timeless film, as psychological aspects of Travis's character shall always remain relevant, giving this film a strong social message. This is a movie that could be viewed again and again, and you would pick up new little details you didn't notice before every time. It's violent, intense, and profound. It may be a movie from the 70s, but it is in no way stuck in its time.",Null,0,1,12 May 2016
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","I was apprehensive going into a Woody Allen movie, as I have heard mixed things and many have told me that he's just plain odd. However, after viewing Annie Hall I have a newfound appreciation for Allen as a director. He really utilizes the space of New York City to his advantage, and some of the scenes are just plain iconic. There were some really neat and jarring editing tricks throughout the movie that really broke the fourth wall and yanked the viewer from getting too immersed in the world of Alvy. Woody Allen's characters have an odd charm to them, and some are sure to find Alvy to be a bit too whiny and Annie may be seen as a reflection of that, but I felt that these characters played off of each other very well, and were very entertaining. Allen's films may be an acquired taste to some, but they are definitely worth the watch.",Null,0,0,10 May 2016
The Graduate," The Graduate
","The Graduate is somewhat set in its time, with some elements carrying over to the present day. The sense of rebellion of Benjamin's generation is made clear throughout the film in its own quirky way. Dustin Hoffman's acting was simply outstanding; he played the lost, awkward character of Benjamin quite well. Anne Bancroft also portrayed a strong role as the confident, desirable mother. The editing of the film is also worth noting. The various montage sequences are very well put together, particularly the bed-to-pool scene. I'd consider the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack to be timeless, and the movie would not be the same without it. The Graduate may seem a bit dated to a younger audience, but the editing, acting, and soundtrack are some things that make it worth the watch.",7,0,0,26 April 2016
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain
","Singin' in the Rain was a charming film overall. I enjoyed the meta aspect of the film; a movie within a movie, actors acting as actors, etc. It made things interesting and gave us a good look into the technology of the time. The acting was fantastic, and Jean Hagen's shrill voice was especially entertaining, as was Donald O'Connor's comic relief. The musical numbers were very catchy and engaging, and I found myself recognizing most of the songs without having seen the movie prior. The story kept me engaged, as there was never a dull moment between all the singing, humor, and romance. Regardless of your feelings towards musicals, this film is an undeniable classic, and a must see.",8,0,1,8 April 2016
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction
","I must admit that I'm a little disappointed in myself for not having seen Pulp Fiction until very recently. It's something that I've always been meaning to watch, and you can never really go wrong with Quentin Tarantino. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is legendary, and although I am not a huge fan of John Travolta, I really enjoyed his performance as well. I absolutely loved the style of this film. The dialogue is so smooth and natural, and the way the different story lines intertwine just makes this movie that much more interesting and enjoyable. All of these little elements come together to produce a truly great film, one that I could watch over and over. Pulp Fiction is certainly a must see for everyone, whether you're a film buff or not.",Null,1,2,12 May 2016
Psycho," Psycho
","Excellent film, a real classic. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. The score is iconic and the film wouldn't be the same without it. Anthony Perkins's performance was brilliant and complex. I already had a vague understanding of his character prior to viewing the film, but I was shocked once Norman Bates' many layers were revealed to the camera. There was never a dull moment in this movie, and almost every part of the plot came as a surprise. Hitchcock is a terrific director and the suspense in Psycho never faltered. The lighting and editing augmented the cloak and dagger mood of the film. There was an excellent use of shadow to show everything that was happening without compromising the plot. Nothing in the movie quite happened as expected, making it the perfect thriller.",Null,0,1,4 May 2016
