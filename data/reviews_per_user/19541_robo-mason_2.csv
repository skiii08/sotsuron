Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Does it get any worse than this?
","A legitimately awful movie! The biggest waste of $11 ever. Wow. I can't even begin to express in words how absolutely horrible this film is. If there was a way for me to give this movie a 0/10, I would. Firstly, let's talk about the plot. Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, killing an uprising of vampires. Really. Good fiction is when the concept within the piece of work is believable. BELIEVABLE. I would adore if someone could explain to me how this film is in any way fathomable beyond idiocy. I can't deny the existence of vampire lore in the Southern states in the 19th century, HOWEVER it peaked in the late 19th century, after the death of Lincoln. As far as I'm concerned, the people of the US thought the existence of vampires brought on tuberculosis, and that's where the myth ends. Thus, the absurd 'accuracy' (I use that word sparingly) of this film is only barely hanging on. Please spare me the agony of speaking of this further. Secondly, let's talk about the acting. With an already barely tolerable plot, the acting was not redeeming for this film. I was not expecting the most amazing performance I'd ever seen in my entire life, but it's almost as if they weren't even trying. It was horribly over-acted, further digging this show into the ground.Thirdly, let's talk about the action. If you can get past the wretched plot, perhaps the action wasn't all that bad. I, however, could not. I found the action positively drab and random. Some of the scenes were drawn out so long that any of the initial fascination with the action was faded and lost by the end of it. If you're going to this or renting this for the action, do yourself a favour and get a Bruce Willis or Sly Stallone movie instead. Let's all be honest here, this movie made it onto a few film lists, and is a serious contender against other movies for some great titles. Worst film of the century and horrible film lists, but none the less titles.",1,11,21,9 March 2013
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," What a let down...
","This much anticipated flick was definitely not all it was cracked up to be. After hearing rave reviews from indie rockers and Scott Pilgrim graphic novel fans, I thought I was going to see one seriously awesome film. I was wrong. The acting was far below par, although kept along the lines of Michael Cera's awkward underdog preferred character. The supposedly comedic lines were delivered poorly, falling flatly amidst the silent audience; I'll admit it had its small moments, however. Some were even audible 'ha' worthy. Those moments were far and few between. I really wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone out of their teens that isn't heavily (and I mean HEAVILY) submerged into indie culture or does not have a tolerance for completely nonsensical films. It was truly ridiculous, with a bland plot line and bad acting. I wouldn't waste my time watching it for a second time, or spending any money on related products, such as the novels themselves. If they're anything like what the movie was, I am so not interested.",5,9,17,9 March 2013
