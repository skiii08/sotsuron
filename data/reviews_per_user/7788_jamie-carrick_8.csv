The Lobster," Not Good
","I had heard some good things about this movie, Colin Farrell's performance in particular, so my curious mind wanted to see it. After reading the summary and watching the trailer, I was nothing but intrigued by the unique premise and absurdist hype that surrounded it.As my numerical vote may imply, I have few positive things to say about this movie.-For what it is, it was well done, I guess. There are only so many ways you can pull off an absurdist dystopian comedy, it seems.-The music was nice to listen to, especially the repeated main theme which had some nice combinations.-Lea Seydoux is always a wonder to watch on screen and I found her character to be the most compelling, even for a supporting role.That's it.The plot was occasionally slow, unclear and felt too Brechtian for me too enjoy.From a social justice point of view, this movie's representation was not good and sometimes offensive, especially the scene in which David is told that bisexuality is not an option and he has to choose whether to register himself as homosexual or heterosexual. This did not sit well with me.I found the performances to be a little bland and two-dimensional. Even the leading Colin Farrell couldn't save the day, as his portrayal of David was uneven and nothing remarkable in my opinion. Olivia Colman, a brilliant actress, had some nice, comedic moments, but she had too little material to do anything major with it.All in all, I found this film to be unsatisfying and confusing. Maybe I'm not intelligent enough to understand the subtle nuances of absurdist cinema or the underlying messages contained into the movie, but this film has left me in no hurry to try another absurdist dystopian movie any time soon.",2,7,10,13 August 2016
Zodiac," 'Just because you can't prove it doesn't mean it's not true'
","With Fincher's 'Se7en' ingrained in my mind from repetitive viewing, I was ready to expect another film in the same realm. My overall thought: Same subject matter, completely different results. Now, standing at a very lengthy 160 minutes long, this film requires close attention, quiet concentration and no disturbances. There's no doubt that this film is very thrilling, but there is also a lot of close analysis and theorising involved, making it very complex. I have a policy in place which is if I start a movie, I have to see it through unless something prevents me from doing so. 'Zodiac' was no exception to this rule and I was glad that I didn't give up on it. This film was never going to please everybody. A lot of people are disappointed by lack of action in a movie and I am definitely not one of them. I watch a movie for its depth, plot, characterisation and acting performances. This film covered every one of those and pulled them off with aplomb. The case of the Zodiac Killer is one of the most famous in criminal history and notorious for being unsolved, even if the evidence was rather convincing, and David Fincher uses this opportunity to gather together a thesis of sorts that combs through substantial pieces of evidence and uses the medium of film to piece it together in a highly entertaining way. The acting performances, especially those of Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo, were remarkable. The way that Robert Graysmith evolves over the course of his story arc really played to Gyllenhaal's skills, as audiences would later observe in the chilling 'Nightcrawler'. Graysmith goes from being a socially awkward, rambling, polished cartoonist to a man whom is almost unrecognisable. Graysmith becomes obsessive, impolite with a gritty determination to solve the case that originally stemmed from a simple love of puzzles. Mark Ruffalo is strong as ever in his role as investigator Dave Toschi, tasked with the elaborate quest to uncover the identity of the Zodiac Killer. So, all in all, this film is not for those who aren't willing to pay attention. It's not a non- stop action thriller, though there are some moments, particularly towards the latter end of the movie, which do grip you. What Fincher has accomplished is an in depth look into an infamous cold case, which provides solid theories, all while creating entertainment and characterisation that really drives the story home. Not an easy task, given the abundance of scenes that are merely focused on handwriting samples and analysis of other evidence samples. Though do not misunderstand me, this movie is certainly not boring or dull, it is entertaining and you will get a lot out of it, if not only a burning desire to discover the real identity of the Zodiac Killer. (And no, it's not Ted Cruz)",7,0,0,10 September 2016
Moana," Loved it so much, I saw it again the next day
","Disney's latest animated gambit, 'Moana' details the story of the eponymous character's quest to restore her island, where she is the chief's daughter, to its former state of natural beauty. To do this, she must find the demigod, Maui and sail him across the sea to restore the heart of Te Fiti, a goddess whose stone possesses the power to create life. Quite simply, 'Moana' is exquisite. From the very beginning (in which the history of the film is told) to the very end (where Tamatoa accuses the audience of loving him more if he were named Sebastian), the movie is visually stunning and has a well-crafted nature of storytelling. The titular protagonist follows much the same formula as most Disney heroes do, but Moana is endearing and lovable enough for the audience to forget that as they watch her on her journey. The voice actress, 14 (now 16) year old Auli'i Cravalho, gives a competent voice performance given that it was her very first. Her singing vocals are impeccable and, since learning she never received professional training, I was more impressed with her performances. The screenplay is very well done and the characters are given lots of opportunities for humour, a lot of them being via repetition. A particular standout is Moana's animal companion, Heihei the chicken who is quite simply one of the best parts of the movie. The songs are catchy and excellently written: 'How Far I'll Go' should go down as one of the greatest Disney songs ever written and performed in my opinion. Never have I listened to a Disney song more than this one. Move over, Frozen, Moana is coming. All in all, this movie is a wonderful effort by Disney, made more pleasing by the lack of Caucasian characters. The all-Polynesian cast and characters were refreshing to watch, especially given Disney not-too-stellar reputation with diversity. I would happily consider this my favourite Disney animation of all time because it would definitely deserve such a title. All I can say is make sure you watch this film, because it does not disappoint.",10,3,14,5 December 2016
The Town," The action is great, the plot has good pacing but main strength is with the cast.
","My desire to see this came from the cast, as I've followed their careers for quite some time, namely Affleck, Renner and Lively. I was not disappointed. Now I'm not going to pretend that I'm an expert in the area of heist movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. No comparisons to others, but as its own movie it does pretty well. I mean there were some moments where I wasn't satisfied, particularly with the ending, but overall it was a great movie.The action is great, the plot has good pacing but main strength is with the cast.Ben Affleck has proved yet again that he's a director, a great writer and an actor who's worth his salt. Many have reviewed Affleck's performance as 'wooden' and 'filled with nothing but frowning', but I think he did a wonderful job. His delivery was appropriate, his expressions were on point and I think that if you can play a criminal and a killer and still make the audience root for you in the end, then you've done a good job. And I inexplicably found myself rooting for MacCray by the end of the movie.Blake Lively continues to impress me as she sheds her 'Gossip Girl' fame and battles with being taken seriously as an actress of real standing. Her character 'Krista' was terribly two-dimensional and just like most other stereotypical 'skanky' characters that are portrayed in movies, but she did it well and I have no complaints, except for maybe the fact that her laugh is a little childlike and didn't really fit with her character, but that is very minor. Jeremy Renner was, in a word, exquisite. He was breathtakingly haunting as he echoes his previous acclaimed role in 'The Hurt Locker', with a powerful performance as Jem, a ruthless, no-nonsense criminal who solves his problems with bullets and no mercy. He stole the show for sure, creating a complex, provocative performance out of a character who lacks development. He really was spectacular. Buy this movie on DVD or stream it wherever you can because you will have a good time watching it.",8,5,7,10 September 2016
Man of Steel," A Movie For The Fans...
","Nobody said this film was going to sweep come awards season. Nobody said that Snyder would win Best Director at the Oscars that year. Critics weren't too kind towards this movie, complaining about several different things. Some of it I agree with, others I don't.Let's start with the main attraction of this movie. Henry Cavill. No I'm joking (I'm not), it's the ACTION. The action sequences which filled the majority of the movie. I personally enjoyed the special effects and the sequences were nicely edited most of the time. I didn't enjoy the sheer number of action moments. Yes, this is first and foremost an action movie and I expected a lot of it. Just...not that much.Let's talk about the acting.Overall, it was good. The characters were well acted. Henry Cavill made a brilliant Clark Kent in my opinion. He looked the part and he acted the part well. His American accent was very good. His posture was fit for a superhero and sometimes I found myself seeing Chris Evans' iconic Captain America in his tone and words. That's a good thing, by the way. It means Henry nailed the superhero thing.And now onto one of my favourite ever actresses, Amy Adams, who found the role she was born to play, Lois Lane. I read somewhere that she auditioned several times in other Superman features to be Lois and there's a reason for that. To me, Amy Adams IS Lois Lane. Her portrayal was smart, subtle yet dramatic in all the right places.Michael Shannon played a great role as Zod. Sorry...General Zod. After only seeing him in Revolutionary Road, I expected to nail this role, even though it is a vast change from that role. He definitely did a good villain justice.I was sadly disappointed but Russell Crowe yet again (after Les Mis, I didn't really have high hopes). All of his dialogue felt wooden and I could sense boredom in his performance. It was very stiff and two-dimensional, and I feel like more could have been done with his character.All in all, I enjoyed my experience in watching this movie. Superhero fans will no doubt enjoy it, even if they find fault in some places. The chemistry between Cavill and Adams is natural and easy, the acting is great, the storyline is fun and action-packed. The cast is hot (looking at you Cavill) and it was a very solid effort at a genre that polarises opinion on every outing (see Thor: The Dark World for more on that)",6,1,3,28 August 2016
Now You See Me," Absolutely Brilliant! Must see!
","This movie does not deserve the bad reviews that I've seen! Not at all!I'm a person who watches a film for the actors (at first) and then is surprised by the film itself. I watched this film for Mark Ruffalo and Dave Franco. I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I usually write in depth about all of the good things in a movie, but if I did that for this it would go over the 1000 word limit IMDb has set. So I'll make a list instead of why I love this movie so much. -Unique plot -Some amazing performances -Clever twists -Action that is enjoyable to watch -I realised what the twists were merely seconds before their reveal, something which I think every movie twist aims to achieve. -Well executed As with any review and with any film, there have to be some drawbacks: -Isla Fisher was criminally underused (though that applies to the rest of Hollywood too) -Lack of character development after the first introductions -Can be confusing if you don't pay full attention (but I did so this doesn't really count as a flaw) -Dave Franco remained fully clothed the entire time I highly recommend you get yourself a DVD copy of this film or buy it on Amazon Video or watch it wherever you can! Ignore the bad reviews, people are stupid.",10,4,6,28 August 2016
Prisoners," Gyllenhaal shines in an average mystery thriller
","Okay, so I enjoyed this, perhaps less than I anticipated. And here's why. I'd heard such good things about this movie that my expectations were too high. I'll just keep things simple and short (unlike this movie). -The first hour was bland, and the second hour was incredible. -Jake Gyllenhaal was outstanding, as were Dano, Davis and Howard. -Hugh Jackman was not good. Overacting in some parts, stiff and wooden in others, though that might be down to the simplicity of his character and a lack of overall development. -Writing was good, if a little plain. -Some of the cinematography was really nice, especially the close up shots of Alex while he's trapped. -I really enjoyed the ending. I loved how not everything was wrapped up in a simple bow like a lot of movies are: it represents reality and how things may work out, though not everything will. It also left the viewer to fill in the blanks for themselves, which I quite liked. Does Loki find Keller in the end? Does Keller die in the hole? Is Keller already dead in the hole? Who knows?Should you watch this movie? Yes. Will you enjoy it? Maybe. Was it good? Yes. It all comes down to personal preference. This movie compared to the likes of Gyllenhaal's other best performances in my opinion, Zodiac and Nightcrawler, this fell short of the mark, though Jake was extraordinary yet again.",9,0,0,12 September 2016
The Fighter," Not Just Another Boxing Movie
","Not knowing a lot about this movie going in, I expected it to be just another boxing movie that focuses on a complete underdog going from a nobody to a world champion, but I was wrong.Sure, Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) acquires underdog status somewhere along the way, particularly in the final few fights, but he is much more than that.I was more than impressed with the performances. The four main leads really brought some of the best work.Mark Wahlberg's Mickey Ward was very convincing and I thought his boxing performances were dedicated and sharp. He was more than just a boxer who wanted to be the best. He switched between idealising his brother and realising his flaws while still hoping for redemption.Christian Bale fully deserved his Oscar for this performance as Dicky Eklund, a local legend and drug addict. The script gives him a lot to work with, but I was more impressed with his depth of facial expression to convey Dicky's emotions. The scene in which Mickey tells him about the deal not to work with him anymore was stellar. I really believed it, down to Bale's performance.I've always been impressed with Amy Adams in everything she does and her role as bar worker Charlene Fleming was no exception. Charlene is a college dropout (due to partying too hard) who attended on a high jump scholarship. She becomes romantically entangled with Mickey and her fiery personality and grit cause problems with Mickey's family members. Adams plays the part with conviction and precision that comes from a dedicated approach to the role. She really proves herself as one of the greatest in her generation.Melissa Leo pulls out a wonderful performance as Alice Eklund-Ward, mother to Mickey, Dicky and their sisters. I was impressed with Leo's performance, though less so than her co-stars. In my opinion, the Academy Award belonged to Amy Adams for her performance as Charlene.The boxing scenes weren't really all that different from other movies, but still exciting and exhilarating. The final fight of the film Ward v Neary left me gripped, unable to look away, my heart pounding as the action took place.All in all, a wonderful movie that proves David O'Russell's talent in directing award-winning performances with a cast that give everything that have to their characters. So I give it a 9/10",9,0,0,28 August 2016
