Catch Me If You Can," Fascinating, joyful and thoughtful.
","Inspired by the true story of Frank William Abagnale junior the movie follows Frank's runaways of being a con man successfully posing as an airplane pilot, a doctor and an attorney Frank by escaping from FBI for years.Here we see the story of a schoolboy, a minor American teenager who managed to work in different spheres while being so young. The movie itself is light and fascinating with a good humour as well. However, the story also touches some deep social issues by showing a guy who has experienced the divorce of his parents, the adulating period and the significant time when he was completely lonely. Being influenced by parental problems, he decides to escape a life he no longer loves as well as to escape from himself. Therefor, the film gives us the opportunity to wonder about who we are in the face of where we have come from.Dreaming about a united family, Frank works to get his mother and father back together and make the family whole again. Of course, this can't work. During the movie he meets with father a several times and tries to convince him to get his mother back but a teenager doesn't understand that everything is broken and he needs to face the cruel world by himself. The moment, when Frank sits with Brenda's family and watching them being happy he wants so badly to have the same reunion and be frankly loved by his own family. While I was watching the movie, I clearly saw that Frank tries to resemble his father. Moreover, he learns from his father how to be the 'second mouse' and get off with whole skin, whereas the moment with a necklace demonstrates it clearly.I also was astonished by this movie as the director shot so many peculiar and unique details which helped us to understand the personality of Abagnale. For instance, the scene when Frank comes to cash his checks and witnesses the name tags whether the woman is Miss or Mrs. for the purpose of flirting or not. Or another moment, when at the beginning of the movie the comics with Flash hero are shown just next to the Frank's bed and after that the allusion to this hero appears during the whole movie.So , I highly recommend to watch this movie as you will surely enjoy the great work of Spielberg and the perfect acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.",10,2,3,18 February 2019
