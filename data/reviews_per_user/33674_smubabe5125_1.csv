Walk the Line," My favorite movie
","When I saw the previews for this movie, I was very excited to see it. Little did I know that after I saw it for the first time I would see it twice more after that. I thought that this movie was the best film I have ever seen. I have always loved Johnny Cash's music and I think that Juaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon did a phenomenal job of portraying John and June in the movie. I have already seen this movie three times and believe me that I will see it several more times in theaters until it comes out on DVD. When I first watched this film, I was very touched. Watching someone else detox the way I did when I was in rehab was amazing. I honestly didn't think that the cold sweats and everything happened to anyone else but myself. Also I have never really seen anyone go so far down with drugs in person. I had always kept myself very secluded when I was using so I didn't really know what it looked like in person.",10,5,9,9 December 2005
