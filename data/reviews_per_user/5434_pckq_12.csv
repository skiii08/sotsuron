Hereditary," carbon copy of 'The Witch'
","Heriditary SUCKS. It doesn't only suck because this is a carbon copy of 'The Witch', which wasn't the most amazing film to begin with, no Hereditary manages to be even worse than 'The Witch'. Same as 'The Witch' and 'The Blairwitch Project' many moons before that, the main focus of this witchery film is to generate Internet Hype. Obviously the studio paid a lot of money for favorable reviews around the net. And it works. Since as with so many big money Hollywood films these days, the deciding factor is opinion shaping via the paid studio shills.Avoid like the pest. Also kudos to Gabriel Byrne and Toni Colette who's performances were great, but ultimately couldn't save this glorified turd.",2,0,3,25 August 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rogue One puts the WOW-factor back in Star Wars
","Just when you thought JJ Abrams buried Star Wars six feet underground, comes the glorious resurrection of the franchise in the form of Rogue One.This is the first Star Wars Movie since 1983 that had me say WOW! out loud many times throughout the film.From acting, to camera, to music and characters, everything in Rogue One felt genuinely impressive, fresh and exciting.Rogue One will make you laugh, make you cry, wow you and keep you on the edge of your seat for a wild 133 minute ride.With the bar set this high it will be interesting to see if the next Star Wars film will be able to keep up with Rogue One.",10,1,5,9 April 2017
Passengers," Sci-fi for generation stupid
","This film is bad. Its not bad in a funny way, its just bad.There are elements from past sci-fi films in Passengers DNA that make you hope that the film will pick up in pace, or quality, which sadly never happens.This film is flat, dull, with flat characters that you probably do not care for.I feel bad for larry fishburne who has seen better roles in his career. Giant snoozefest, not recommended, despite all the bought positive reviews on this page.Better luck next time!",1,79,155,18 January 2017
Deadpool 2," cosplay gone horribly wrong
","Deadpool 2 same as the first film is a mixed bag. Obviously the studio wanted to stuff their pockets full of cash again, so they didn't dare to stray from the established formular.As a comedy Deadpool 2 works really well. The gags range from genuinely funny to slightly cringe worthy. If you expect to get a few laughs out of this you will not be disappointed. I promise.On the other hand, if you are a X-Force comics fan, stay away as far as possible. The casting is hilariously bad. The middle aged Hollywood actor who plays cable is absolutely mis-casted. Beats me why they didn't ask Dolph Lundgren to play cable.
As mostly with these superhero cash grab fests the whole cast looks like cosplay gone horribly wrong. And of course the lameness doesn't stop there. The CGI design sucks balls as well. Juggernaut looks like a deflated Juggernaut Jr, and Colossus looks like they barrowed him from a cheapo Saturday morning kids show.Seriously if you cant even do Superhero characters the slightest justice, stop trying. It's embarrassing and it outs you as the money grubbing dolts that you are.",4,1,5,24 August 2018
It Follows," wow what a stinker
","Films like 'It follows' better have a decent marketing budget else they will have massive problems finding an audience and thus making some money back, hence all the '10 out of 10' reviews here.First of all 'It Follows' is much like a copy of a bad M. Night Shyamalan film. This film is by no means a horror film. 'It follows' is not scary in any way. The film is unbearably slow and with almost no story development. You get to see dumb, slow, mostly clothed people having sex. There are a few naked people thrown in and a few weird voyeuristic scenes for no good reason.'It follows' rather follows the formula of the mystery thriller that forces you to keep watching only to find out that the end is largely open for interpretation since the mystery does not get solved towards the end. That has been done before multiple times before and it's always lame and leaves the viewer with the feeling of wasted time.",1,78,158,23 August 2015
Logan," lame sell out
","Lets jump right in, shall we? X-Men style. Claws out, SNIKT!Speaking of which... in this poorly edited flick, we have two Mutants that saved the world, the very universe, and everything in between time and time again, yet everyone acts like they are in cheesy Jean- Claude Van Damme road-movie.Our main protagonist, everyone's favorite claw-wielding Mutant gets the clichéd-has-been-hero treatment. Awesome? Not really because the whole thing unfolds every bit as lame as you could imagine.This creatively bankrupt paint-by-numbers production stretches the 5'3' Wolverine to 6'3'. Invisible stilts anyone? Hollywood's version of Wolverine in 'Logan' doesn't have much in common with the Marvel comics character, besides sharing the same name.The pathetic ending, after the clichéd showdown with the doppelganger really had me scratching my head. This definitely isn't the Wolverine from the comics. Instead it's Hollywoods pale rip off for monetary gain.The only ray of light here was Patrick Stewart's solid performance, who always delivers in his roles.Ever since the seventies Stan Lee wanted to see his superheroes make a living in Hollywood, but ultimately by doing so Marvel sacrificed all integrity and identity.To all longtime X-Men Comic fans, do yourself a favor stay away from this awful bastardization. It's devoid of any creative substance or even a hint of brilliance.",1,29,67,21 May 2017
Midsommar," 'Horror' Movie for millennials / one trick pony
","Same as Hereditary, Midsommar depicts a bunch of unsympathetic assholes in loosely connected grotesque scenes.And same as Hereditry this movie is shallow, unsatisfying and often unintentionally hilarious. If you are into rekt clips, well researched folklore, and get excited at other peoples 'misfortunes' Midsommar will be your thing. If you expect a real movie with emotional depth, likeable characters and a coherent story, stay away. 2 out of 10 for the lush nature scenes.",2,15,25,29 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," dumbed down cinema for adhd patients
","I am a fan of the 1933 King Kong Movie. So every time Hollywood decides to dust the gorilla suit off i find myself on board... full of hope that this won't just be the next ludicrous disaster.Guess what? This latest incarnation might even be worse than the previous one. Kong: Skull Island is a ridiculously bad film despite all the acting talent. Speaking of the actors, the casting in this film felt way off. Like said, these are some of today's better acting talents, but they don't really shine in their dumbed down cartoon character roles.While Kong: Skull Island's CGI isn't all bad i really feel sorry for the hairy big guy who was better off in black and white.",1,6,14,9 April 2017
Wonder Woman," the usual superhero cash grab fest
","Wonder Woman 2017 is a generic, yet slightly entertaining adventure movie with no deeper understanding or appreciation for the source material.Gal Godot lacks the presence and physicality of the DC Comics character. David Thewlis who is a brilliant character actor, simply doesn't fit as the god of war either. Better see him in Fargo 3, where he really shines!Wonder Woman is the usual superhero cash grab fest based on a completely predictable, paint by numbers script. The script here is so interchangeable it could fit any Hollywood heroes from Indiana Jones to Robert Downey Jr's impersonation of Sherlock Holmes. On the bright side there are a few laughs here, including the unintentional ones when they cut back and forth between the stunt woman and Gal Gadot.Wonder Woman this is surely not, but a brainless 141 min adventure ride. If you expected any other than another DC Comics sell-out at this time the last laugh is on you.",2,13,32,8 July 2017
Mother!," Brilliant movie
","You know it's art if it causes an outrage. I totally love how this film exposes all those rather vocal idiots, who are eager to declare how much they 'hate' this film. Nicely played Arnofsky, seriously :DMother is brilliant. It is Arnofsky's best, most refined work by far. It lures the unsuspecting viewer in with the promise of solving it's first half mystery, only to brutally deliver it's extremely uncomfortable message during the second half.I think Arnofsky deserves an Oscar for trolling all those outraged reviewers on this very site alone. Is it pretentious to hate something that you don't understand, and then moving on calling it pretentious?More films with actual substance, and less retarded rubber heroes please.",10,3,12,8 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disney's Paint-By-Numbers Production
","Besides the incredible wow factor one thing the original 1977's Star Wars did accomplish was setting the bar incredibly high for any SciFi films to follow, including the series own sequels and thus instantly creating a huge cult following.Given JJ Abrams notorious reputation of creating shallow, uninspired films i went into 'the force awakens' with ZERO expectations. The film didn't disappoint me, it's fairly entertaining here and there. JJ pulls off to deliver a barely mediocre film without the help of massive lensflare effects. Congrats to that JJ!The good: The Star Wars galaxy is somewhat of a dark and dangerous place again. The production design totally nails that classic Star Wars look and feel. The visuals are already a good 50% of the films appeal. And boy John Williams music is brilliant too!It was nice to see the oldschool hero cast once more in their classic roles. Especially the Chewbacca character delivered as he always did. Congrats Chewie, and a huge thumbs up to John Williams and of course the production design team!The Film starts out really strong and powerful having you expect a much better film to follow. Alas that does not happen...The bad: The Force Awakens loses steam quickly. Around mid to half the film almost totally falls apart. Many of the lines, many of the story elements including the whole ending dynamic are directly looted from the 1977's original Star Wars movie. One could argue that was done to have longtime fans feel directly at home in this new production, however it just yells unoriginal, shallow and creatively bankrupt directly from the screen and into the audience. And thus many of the story elements of this paint-by-numbers production ultimately fail to make sense.The worst part about Star Wars 7 however is the new villain. It is beyond me how a strong character like Darth Maul gets killed off after only one film yet this laughable excuse of a villain lives to see another sequel. Adam Driver is clearly miscasted and delivers quite an unintentionally funny scene which had the cinema audience laugh out loud as soon as his character takes his mask off on screen.Bottom line, if you don't expect much the force awakens will not disappoint much during its 135 mins pop corn movie ride. And if you ever asked yourself where all the better halves of the evil empires mischievous personnel are, The Force Awakens answers that question too! They are hard a work of course making the far far away galaxy a much more sinister place alongside their hubbies on the evil evil Deathsta.... errrr STARKILLER BASE i mean!!",4,14,24,20 December 2015
What We Do in the Shadows," lame and cringe-worthy
","So i tried to watch this film yesterday without being biased as i haven't read anything about it, nor did i watch the trailer.Usually i like bad films because they make me laugh. It's like a bad joke, you can't help laughing at how bad it is. However 'What We Do in the Shadows' is so extreme lame and cringe-worthy you will be tempted to switch it off halfway through which is something i rarely ever do. To sum it up, absence of talent can be really amusing, but in this case it's just awful and painfully unbearable. The overwhelming spam of fake 10 out of 10 reviews for this disaster of a comedy on this very site is funnier than any joke/sketch/dialogue in the film. Don't be fooled!",2,9,40,20 August 2015
