The Blair Witch Project," One of the year's best films.
","Finally, a horror film wholly original! A film about three young adults that go into the woods to get material about a mysterious legend and never return. With the actors portraying themselves and their lines improvised, it is hard not to believe their thoughts, feelings and emotions.As the fear closes in around them, the audience approaches a conclusion that one may not understand unless they have been paying close attention. But the payoff is sudden, dramatic, and terrifying.This movie lives up to the hype. And then some. Four stars.",10,2,4,19 July 1999
Memento," Remember Memento
","Okay, as you will see from reading the comments, this is like a Harold Pinter play, in that the story is told BACKWARDS. So paying attention is key here. But once you get to the end/beginning, and all the rest of the pieces of the puzzle are laid into place, you are going to be saying two things:1): That was one of the best films I have seen this year!2): Why wasn't this film picked up by a major distributor?However, if your attention span is as short as Leonard's memory, you may want to see something else.",Null,0,0,30 March 2001
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Worst Film of The Decade
","'Uh oh' is right. A sick, perverse TV series is now an even more sick, even more perverse motion picture. Yes, those graduates of the Howard Stern School of Taste and Tact, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are at it again.Between Kenny dying and being sent to a heaven populated with topless females, Saddam Hussein having sexual relations with Satan, songs laden with profanity and an open attack on Canada, I am saddened that the IMDB does not have a rating lower than one star.I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, HATE this film!!!!As Saving Private Ryan is easily the best film of the 1990's, this could very well be the worst.",Null,0,1,4 July 1999
Bridesmaids," The chick flick of the summer has arrived!!
","I saw this film on a lark, and I am glad I did. This film is head and shoulders better than SOMETHING BORROWED. This is a chick flick that is accessible to ALL (hooray!). The characters have more dimension and depth. You actually felt for these people, especially Annie and Officer Rhodes, played by the marvellous and daring Kristen Wiig and delightful Chris o'Dowd.I am looking at Melissa McCarthy as the next breakaway star, leaving MIKE AND MOLLY and GILMORE GIRLS far behind as she gives us the astute and very funny Megan.Of course, the funniest part of the film just has to be in the trailer. Too bad.The problems I had with this film are that the men in this film, on screen and off, are not looked upon very well (with the exception of Ted and Officer Rhodes). Neither is marriage, even for a newlywed who is part of the bridal party.Some scenes are just awkward, such as when Annie and Helen give dueling engagement toasts, or when Wilson Phillips appears to lip sync to a song about 22 years old.And, finally, do you think that since this was Jill Clayburgh's last film, they could have dedicated it to her memory? I'm just saying.Guys, this is the chick flick you will want to take your girlfriends and wives to. And vice versa. And they all will thank you.",7,2,6,14 May 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Am I the only one to be disappointed??? ***spoilerrific***
","Yeah. I came out of the film disappointed. Not feeling like I had a good time.Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie. But there are things that brought it down and too many of them for it to be forgivable.1) Dumbledore's brother and sister. You know what I mean. Referred to and never followed upon.2) The kiss. Didn't happen in the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, did the Chamber scene happen at all? In the book, it happens after Ron expresses concern for the welfare of the elves (in light of Dobby's heroic death) in the outbreak of a fire at Hogwarts. Here, it is given to you as a variation of the 'We're alive! Let's kiss!' movie clich√©'.3) Fred's death should have been on screen. Period.4) The Avada Kedavra curse didn't make bodies disintergrate. Until Voldemort (and perhaps Bellatrix, too?). What? 5) The roles of Matthew Lewis and Evanna Lynch (Neville and Luna respectively) were enough to warrant their names as part of the supporting cast. To only see their names in the full cast is scandalous to say the least.(And, yes, I am aware two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gets the same treatment. I know she makes two small appearances, but again, she has two bloody Oscars! Either she is very humble or she needs a better agent.) 6) They really should have stuck with the CGI aging. Except for maybe Ginny and Draco, none of them looked like they were 36.",5,82,131,15 July 2011
High Fidelity," One of the year's best films
","Top 5 reasons I love this film:1) John Cusack 2) Jack Black 3) the soundtrack 4) the script 5) Iben Hjelje (who looks like a cross between Mary Stuart Masterson and Patricia Arquette)  If you do not see this film, you will regret it forever. Yes, it is that good.",Null,0,1,12 April 2000
