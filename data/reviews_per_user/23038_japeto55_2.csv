Love and Death," Genius!!!!
","I think this is one of Woody Allen's best, the plot is good, the music selection is even better and you laugh and laugh all over the film. I think God gave Woody Allen his comical side. Woody Allen has always been a creative, intelligent and funny guy, and this picture is not an exception of his talent. Some people would say that this film is very silly, but it's Woody Allen's way of make people laugh till their abdomen hurts. Like I've said before, Allen is a genius. My father incitated me to watch this film (he's a Woody Allen fan) and I thank him so much. I give this film a 9 (*********) out of 10 (**********). In other words: very good.",9,1,3,18 September 2005
