The Blair Witch Project," Hype-a-rama
","Can we say 'Hallowe'en cash in' children? Picture this: Film released in which some people go camping in the woods, get shouted at, strange things happen, find a house, film ends. Put it like that and the Blair Witch Project simplicity is revealed.  Not that I'm saying this is bad - simple can be good, and to be fair, as most lines were improvised, a simple plot can be turned into a fairly realistic film.  Note: fairly realistic.  No documentary team, no matter HOW amateur, would take footage as shakey as some of the Blair Witch shots.  OK, it's on a camcorder, but even so.  The word 'overplayed' springs to mind. The same rings true with the dialogue - the arguments seem drawn out, the emotion just somehow inappropriate, and the locations are simply dull. It has its good points though: the few scary bits ARE scary, and the implied witchcraft is intriguing spooky, but as a whole the movie just seems too bland for my liking. Fair play to the people who created it, on a small budget and amateur teams, but I  ain't gonna eat a cake just coz the cook is inexperienced and buys cheap ingredients. For a much classier horror, I recommend The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",Null,0,0,11 November 1999
American Pie," Pale ale??
","Ho ho ho.  This is one of those films that makes you think 'Yes, it is good to be alive, and yes, being 18 was DAMN fun.' A superb film by anyone's standards, marred only perhaps in its dubious moral-soaked fables towards the end, this is definitely one to watch. The humour is toilet humour, sure, but its toilet humour dressed up in a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe, whilst listening to some good jazz. Male or female, old or young, I recomend this film.  It has some classic scenes (pie, anyone?) and some good gags. Comparable, perhaps, to Something About Mary, but tenfold funnier.",9,0,0,18 November 1999
The Truman Show," On the air - but who cares?
","A wonderful concept, highly original, but unfortunately, poorly implemented. The sets are good and Jim Carrey's as good as he ever was, though.  You just feel when you leave the cinema that something was missing.  No real beginning and no real end.",3,5,11,13 November 1998
