Source Code," A lot better then it should be
","A sifi thriller that start of like it could had been a stand alone episode of The X Files, a good episode season 6 episode or so that is. So I was kinda expecting a decent movie but as it progressed I really got hooked on it. More then I actually should.There are some details that never got explained to the full extend, but I did not bother that much. The acting was excellent and I like how they managed to develop the characters without taking the speed out of the movie. Some fans of the genre will not like the bright ending of the movie. I got so attached to the main character however, that I was glad he achieved his goal.9 stars because I had such a great time with this movie!",9,0,0,14 April 2020
