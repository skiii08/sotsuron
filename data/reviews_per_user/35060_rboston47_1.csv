Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar is Jarringly Unbearable. Weak death scene for Liam.
","After 3 years I finally managed to sit thru the whole movie. I stopped watching the movie the first time at the pod chase because I could not just bear to listen to Jar Jar anymore. Lucas should be flogged for ruining a movie and wasting money like that. Yes it's true Lucas has used children's characters like the Ewoks, but nothing in any movie by any director I have ever seen is ANNOYING as having to listen to Jar Jar. He doesn't even make sense. You just pick out a few words from each sentence cause that's all that makes sense. It distracts from the whole movie. Ewoks were for the kiddies but they just squealed or whatever. Jar Jar is by far the worst character ever.What's up with the Master Jedi Knight Liam going out so weak against the silent Sith dude? He just lets Darth Maul give him a shot to the chest. Very undramatic.  Obi Wan suddenly surprising Darth and taking him out is unbelievable considering what just happened to his master.Weak Weak Weak. Yes this movie is more expensive to make, but it was a waste of time with Jar Jar thrown in. I refuse to watch any more sequels, until Lucas makes a copy with Jar Jar edited out.",1,4,7,4 June 2002
