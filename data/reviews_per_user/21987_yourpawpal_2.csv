Source Code," Source Code: Explosive Thrill Ride
","Jake Gyllenhaal stars in 'Source Code', a science fiction time-travel thriller directed by Duncan Jones. A bomb explosion occurs on a Chicago train that derails the locomotive and in turn kills hundreds of people. In an attempt to identify the bomber and prevent another, larger attack on downtown Chicago, Captain Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) is forced to encompass the body of one of the passengers during the eight minutes before the man is killed. However, during his first trip back, Captain Stevens fails to gather enough clues to prevent the second bomb attack. With time quickly running out, he must repeat the mission again and again in a desperate race to head off one of the deadliest terrorist attacks ever. 'Source Code', a follow-up film by director Duncan Jones, who made his directorial debut in 'Moon', truly shined after receiving a much larger budget to go to every length for this spectacular film. Far from turning into another Michael Bay, Jones still manages to create this movie from the same roots as his independent film 'Moon'. While it may not be as thought-provoking as 'Inception' or 'Memoriam', this isn't simply another mindless action blockbuster. The plot is much more intricate than it may appear, creating an in-depth film that the average moviegoer can easily immerse themselves in. Jake Gyllenhaal has starred in varying roles throughout his career, whether it be in the unforgettable cult favorite 'Donnie Darko', the controversial film 'Brokeback Mountain' or a simple romantic comedy like 'Love and Other Drugs', Gyllenhaal has always been able to reveal another side of his acting range in his movies. In 'Source Code' he is portrayed as a confident action hero, while still possessing the heart and desperation of a man locked in time. The supporting actors Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright also carry the film well in their respective roles. Monaghan and Gyllenhaal have great chemistry together, making their characters' emotions seem realistic and believable. This movie is a groundbreaking and heart-pounding thrill ride that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The script is brilliant, with easy to follow dialogue, characters that you can invest in yourself in and a storyline that constantly takes an unexpected turn. Although the beginning is slightly repetitive and reminiscent of 'Deja Vu', the movie soon finds its footing and breaks into the underlying plot. Try to catch this movie before it leaves theatersâ€“it's a ride you won't want to miss.",Null,0,1,11 September 2011
Mamma Mia!," Amazingly Great! Blew me away.
","I went with my mom and we both had a wonderful time. Donna(Meryl Streep) is a great actress in this movie, and I thought that Sophie's (Amanda Seyfried) voice was absolutely amazing! It made me laugh, and nearly cry. I had so much fun watching this feel-good movie. Sam(Pierce Brosnan) was a surprisingly good singer, in my opinion, and I felt that Bill(Stellan) and Harry(Collin Firth) had a great time with this movie. The songs by ABBA were great, of course, and fit into the movie very well. It made me want to jump up and dance in the movie theater, and though I did not, I couldn't help singing along to some of the songs. Even though I did not grow up with ABBA, my mom did, and I could tell she was having an awesome time. I hope you have as much fun as I had with 'Mamma Mia!'",10,1,2,28 July 2008
