Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," ha. this surprised me.
","this gem was on HBO the other day and I thought to myself: wow, this must be silly but I'll give it a shot. Man, am I glad I did. first of all, you can rest easy knowing that the people who made this film knew that it's a ridiculous premise so the fact that it's silly actually endears itself to you.the actors are over-the-top but that's the point. the guy who is playing abraham lincoln literally looks nothing like him. there are a ton of plot holes that make no sense. so why the high rating? because it's so entertaining, it's so good because the directors knew where this film belonged.what surprised me was the thought that was put behind making this premise seem legitimate. there are a lot of real historical facts that fit perfectly into the premise that Abraham Lincoln was indeed a vampire hunter.",8,1,2,19 August 2013
