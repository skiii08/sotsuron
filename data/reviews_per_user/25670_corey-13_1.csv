Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A character away from being the best Star Wars ever
","George Lucas' latest installment to Star Wars was once again, a masterpiece. To answer the critics quickly: The dialogue is consistent with the rest of the trilogy.  George Lucas has his characters talk poetically at times, but the Star Wars universe isn't real so there is no reason for his dialogue to be.  It is real for the Star Wars universe.  The world is beautiful as we all already know, but the characters, with one exception, are wonderful as well.  There is a humanitarian story of the likes of the first Star Wars movie.  I don't understand what the critics wanted.  Imagine the first Star Wars without seeing Empire or Return of the Jedi.  You wouldn't know Darth Vadar was Luke's father, Yoda even existed, Princess Leia was Luke's sister, or Han Solo and Leia would have romance.Quickly, I want to say that Darth Maul was awesome.  I don't understand how Mr. Lucas can keep coming up with the coolest and most interesting bad guys of all time.  Although his part is small and he says so little, he is shrouded in mystery.  This mystery is only enhanced by my previous two comments.  Darth Maul was a powerful and exciting new villain.The Phantom Menace had a wonderful story, great characters, wonderful visuals and sound, and the unique Star Wars/Indiana Jones feel that only George Lucas can bring to a movie.  It might have been my favorite Star Wars film if it weren't for Jar Jar Binks.  More than any filmmaker, I admire George Lucas, but I just know that this character didn't work.  He was nothing more than a distraction to the rest of the story.  R2-D2 and C-3PO were wonderful comic relief characters in the past movies and there were moments of it in this prequel.  However, Jar Jar Binks just didn't have the magic that they always did.  I am sure George can tell this and I hope we don't see him in any of the next two movies.  Go see The Phantom Menace and you'll see what I mean.Overall, I just want to say, 'Thanks once again, Mr. Lucas'.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
