The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Inifintely Amazing!
","I originally heard about the existence of 'Perks' from news articles stating that Emma Watson would be in the movie (I'm a huge Harry Potter fan!) I read some of the book summaries and thought it sounded interesting, so I decided to read the book. I absolutely fell in love with it! Ever since, I had been wanting to see the movie, and had been upset at finding out it wasn't coming out near me in September. Finally, this past Friday it came out by me, so on Saturday a couple friends and I went to go see it. Overall, it was an incredible movie. They did leave out certain aspects from the book, but they were mostly parts that I could take or leave anyway. They kept the main parts in, as well as all of the best lines, which I greatly appreciated. The ending almost made me cry; it's just so powerful seeing these things I've read about come to life. Logan, Emma, and Ezra were amazing, as well as the supporting cast. Emma's accent was somewhat detectable in certain parts, but even so she portrayed Sam so well. And Ezra was by far the perfect Patrick, flamboyant, loud, and proud of it. Logan put so much emotion and heart into Charlie that I just wanted to reach through the screen and hug him. He truly was great. Anyone who loves the book as much as me will not be disappointed with the movie. In fact, if you're like me, you will want to see it again the second the credits roll! I know one thing's for sure, as soon as 'Perks' comes on DVD, this girl is snatching a copy quicker than you can say 'Slut and the Falcon'!",10,7,12,8 October 2012
Juno," It Shows the Side of Teen Pregnancy We Never See!!
","I'm not sure why a lot of people do not like this movie. I mean, yeah it's a little different, but that's what makes it so cool! First of all, the teenagers in this movie look like ACTUAL teenagers, which is a refreshing change of pace from all these movies you see where the teens are easily in their 20s or even 30s!! Second of all, Juno herself is just a really fun character! She gives the whole ordeal of being a pregnant teen a new, more entertaining edge. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm kinda sick of all those Lifetime-like movies where they make you think being pregnant at 16 is like the end of the world! Yes, I know being a pregnant teen is a very serious issue, and I am not by any means gonna go out and get knocked up cause I saw this movie. I just like the fact that this movie showed that you can have a normal life even if you become pregnant. I give this movie a 10!!!",10,9,20,29 January 2009
Paranormal Activity," How Did this Scare Anyone??
","I keep hearing people talk about how much they got scared by this movie. How is that possible?? The story barely made sense, there were many plot holes (i.e. Micah never mentioning that the Ouija board caught on fire and calling Katie two different names), and it was just overall awful. I remember seeing previews that showed people in the theater jumping with fright. I don't think I jumped once. In fact, I remember distinctly being incredibly bored and confused by this film! So, if anyone could give me a valid reason why they were so terrified of this movie, please tell me. Personally, I didn't believe that it lived up to its hype and I don't believe it deserves a sequel!",1,2,3,12 February 2010
