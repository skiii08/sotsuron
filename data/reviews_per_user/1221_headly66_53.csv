Frost_Nixon," This is not Nixon.
","As a film it's just OK, a bit trite and under-explored but the bottom line is that Langella's performance is just not Nixon. I thought that Hopkins did a bad version in Nixon (1992), but this makes him look spot on. I understand that actors can take things as they will and sometimes it works (in the 80's I saw David Bowie do Elephant Man on Broadway with no makeup and he pulled it off) but I don't believe at any time or place that this is Richard Nixon. His voice, mannerisms, look, etc, are all wrong or just vague characterizations of the ex President. If your going to do somebody who's as well know for the way he acted it needs to be better than this. Worst impression since Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison. At an early point it becomes a distraction and colors my opinion all the way through. OK film, bad Nixon.",4,9,25,5 January 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Well that was fun...
","I had heard about this movie for years but never saw it until recently and boy was I disappointed. I had to fast forward all the time past the continued repetition of the mothers plight with pills. Could have been a better movie as the lead characters are somewhat interesting but alas it falls flat and tries to make up for it with a vomit inducing ending that just gets sillier and sillier. This was made in 2000 not 1950 so they don't give electroshock therapy to old ladies with no history of mental illness and don't force feed them by hand. This movie has all the typical heroin junkie clichés it can fit in, but there are much better movies about the subject out there. Another thing is the complete over use of every wild camera trick (all of which have been done prior) the director learned in film school. A very forgettable film.",5,1,4,24 December 2008
John Wick," 6,547,234 Bodies counted.......zero plot found
","This may be the most outrageous over the top rip off of Taken yet. But the problem here is John Wick is not trying to save his daughter, wife or even himself. He runs on pure revenge.The entire movie is formatted around his beloved wife dying of cancer, but the cause of all his rage is that his 1969 Mustang is stolen (not a Boss 429 as Iosef says) and his puppy that his dead wife sent him from the grave is killed by Russian mob thugs.What's odd is that this amazing assassin and martial arts expert who is warned by his dog's barks just walks into a home invasion and is knocked out by three knuckleheads.The rest of the movie is massacre after massacre of what seems like 1000 henchmen in scene after scene of choreographed bloodshed.Cliché after cliché, some weird subplot about a hotel, a girl who can beat up guys twice her size, and the funniest part, no police anywhere (except for one who comes to his house, sees dead bodies, knows who John is but does nothing) does an investigation, no news reports, or anything suggesting there has been 100 people killed in a week's time.Oh and you can't pump your own gas in NJ as seen when John meets Iosef in the beginning.",2,6,13,9 March 2015
Star Trek," A new Star Trek made for the new uneducated generation......
","I could care less about the plot of this film as it is no worse than any other of the lesser scripts throughout the ST films, a dumb threat from some as yet unknown enemy with revenge in mind (sound like ST2?) What really bugs me as a casual fan of ST but still very knowledgeable of the series and movies, how could you not be, is the hokey caricatures of the crew. Every one of them sound or look nothing like the originals did. I understand they did not want exact look-a-likes but the voices are so off it's embarrassing. And why does Kirk have bad skin and scars? When the original series came out in 1966 the cast was in their 30's, only 12 or so years older then the new films crew yet they act nothing like them, are they saying their personalities all changed so drastically in ten years?. Spock sounds nothing like Spock etc etc. But the worst has to be Sulu who has such a distinctive voice they should at least tried to make it close, why not just have a black guy with a French accent play him.But I guess this is what happens when the new Hollywood just keeps remaking things instead of creating something new, you can't have it both ways, if your going to recreate a classic character from films past, it has to be the same, not some actors interpretation.",4,23,35,18 May 2009
Fury," Over the top cliché filled mess with a lot of yelling
","What seems like a good cast and excellent cinematography and good directing turns into a laughable mess about 1/2 way through.First, putting a completely inexperienced pencil pusher into a veteran lead tank company is just stupid. No officer would assign him to that position and no sergeant would accept him because he would have been a liability, which he of course is very quickly.The amount of screaming and infighting that goes on is not very consistent with the chain of command in WW2, and the crew which is scared of the Sergeant seem to have no issue mouthing off, getting drunk and acting like total fools around him.The scene where Pitt forces this innocent kid to shoot a German in the back came off as ridiculous. And would probably have ended up in a court martial in real life.Then the girl the kid just met and fell for is killed just seconds after they leave and he acts like he lost his mother so they of course start beating him again like they do through half the film.The final battle against what would have been the top trained German SS just looks like a bunch of idiots all racing toward their deaths without a plan when the German captain could have easily called in heavy cannon to take out the non functional sitting duck tank and saved 100's of his men.Worth a viewing but don't expect much.Also the intermingling of white and black troops seems unrealistic in WW2 since he black regiments were segregated.",5,6,16,5 December 2014
Citizen Kane," Absolutely Amazing
","It's funny reading the reviews by the mental midgets who just don't have the brains to understand this movie. I look at some of them and am baffled as to their concept of a good movie. Terms like awful, terrible and the worst movie ever fill the posts. One guy gave it 1 star but he gave Ocean's Thirteen 10 stars, making it the best movie ever made in his eyes so you can see the mentality we are dealing with.That said, the film is incredible. I could go on for an hour about the camera work, the acting, the angles, lighting and dialog but that has been done ad nauseum. Simply put, this movie achieves a level of quality and depth that few films have ever come close to. Welles is at the height of his genius and his acting is amazing. Today's crowds will find this very boring because they need an explosion every ten seconds to keep their attention, everyone else, enjoy the film forever.",10,1,3,29 March 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Great comedy
","I must have missed this one when it came out because I didn't know what I was getting when I caught it on cable but I was greatly surprised by how clever and funny it was. The characters are great fun and the plot just seems effortless in it's ability to make you forget you are watching a movie and just flow with it. Jason Segel is convincing as a lovable loser and Russell Brand's character is just retarded funny. A great date movie with all the right pieces, the fake TV show Kristen Bell is on is hilarious and she is very cute in this too, but the show stealer is Mila Kunis who can be both beautiful and approachable at the same time. Do not miss this great comedy.",8,0,2,6 December 2010
Ted," Childish, crude for no reason, could have been so much better
","I can't stand Seth MacFarlane so I guess I am to blame for not really liking this movie. As with other MacFarlane entities this one has the same non sequitur, completely random head scratching references in jokes that just fall flat. It's not that I don't get them, its just that they don't fit the context. At one point Ted the Bear sets up his own joke just to use a Pink Floyd lyric reference in which he actually has to say it's from PF so that the 90% of the people in the audience who didn't memorize The Wall are somewhat informed. The entire movie is circled around the Flash Gordon movie from 1980, which is real topical, and I'm sure most of the lines go right over anyone's head under age 35.There is so much cursing in this it's becomes awkward, I could see people squirming at the disgusting jokes, which I have no problem with as long as they are funny, these weren't. Many homophobic and anti- Semitic references for some reason, more nervous laughter from the audience.I actually felt like leaving I was so bored. About 3 funny jokes in the whole thing and one of those was a fart. There was a fat couple sitting near me who laughed out loud all through the last 15 min of the movie, at what I don't know. Maybe they dropped acid before the show. These are the same people who keep Family Guy on the air.Not for kids under 15.",4,18,36,6 July 2012
Pirate Radio," Worst I've seen in years...
","This has got to be the silliest most annoying film I have seen in a long long time. Giving it a proper review would be giving it too much credit. Let me see if I can come up with some words to describe it:Childish, stupid, nonsensical, moronic, boring, nauseating, painful, infantile garbage. There, that sums it up nicely, steer clear of this disaster, this ship sunk before it even left port. It is so badly written and makes so little sense I was just dying for it to be over as soon as possible. Did I get my point across that I despised this film? Now I'm just trying to fill space so I will talk about the weather, it's partly cloudy with a 40% chance of rain.",1,4,11,7 December 2009
Just Go with It," Just throw up on it...
","This is a horrible movie that actually made me laugh a bunch of times but that still doesn't save it from my rating. The laughs have absolutely nothing to do with the plot and are mostly sight gags. The entire premise is absurd, instead of telling the truth to the new girl he met about wearing a wedding ring he concocts a lie so complicated and stupid it could never work under any circumstances. One point being the idea that he is automatically going to stay with this girl even though they only had one night together but still creates situations that would not work in any future with her. His fake wife is really his assistant, his cousin has to do a fake German accent and his fake daughter has to continue to do a English Cockney accent forever?The blonde girlfriend must be the dumbest woman on the planet to believe the nonsense she is being told.The end is predictable.The only good thing was Nick Swardson who is very funny.",2,56,115,21 May 2011
Aquaman," Nice movie...But Aquaman is white
","I am so sick of comic book characters changing color. It has nothing to do with racism, I am an originalist. In almost every movie now we have a main or minor character turn from white to Asian, black, Hispanic and now Aquaman is Hawaiian.Don't get me wrong, Jason Momoa is great for the role, and his exotic looks make the character more interesting. But he isn't Aquaman.The original 1940's Aquaman was a regular man who could breathe underwater and control fish and other underwater life for up to a minute, and he was white.The Silver Age Aquaman was Arthur Curry, the son of Tom Curry, a lighthouse keeper, and Atlanna, a water-breathing outcast from the lost, underwater city of Atlantis, and again he was a blonde haired white man.I just can't imagine the fallout of turning a long time black character into a white person, it would never happen.Here is a partial list of characters who have changed colors....only from white.Nick Fury

The Doors," A sloppy overacted mess of a movie
","I saw The Doors in 1991 when it came out and remember so wanting it to be good because I was a big Doors fan and I guess like most fans knew all the music and poems and facts of the bands history. I was disappointed at the time but I think I even forced myself to believe it was a better film then I remembered because I wanted it to be. Now years later I watch it again and it has to be one of the worst biographies I have ever seen.Jim Morrison did not act this way, he did not walk around speaking in song lyrics and acting like a buffoon. Jim was a likable intelligent guy who mostly acted for the camera, he was a very calculated person and nothing like the stage Jim in his personal life. Stone portrays him as some whack job who only wants to take acid all day long and never gets into the dark side of his life without making it seem like a cartoon and shows us nothing of the creation of his music. The singing and over acting by Kilmer is atrocious, the costumes and scenery all look fake. Did they even look at a picture of Morrison? What's with the hair in the beginning? We learn nothing of the history of the other band members, Pamela was not on the scene until way after they became a band and the use of their own music throughout the movie seems really unnecessary and takes away from it feeling like the time period, especially when we hear songs that would not come out until years later. The montage of them in the hippie scene at Haight Ashbury is embarrassing.I wish someone would make a real Doors film in a serious manner and explore the music better.",3,12,25,11 March 2010
Empire of the Sun," Incredibly annoying film - hours of soulless, pointless nothing
","I watched this again as it had come out on Blu-Ray and now I remember why I didn't get all the way through the last time. Spielberg pulls out all the stops trying to bore you to death in this extremely dull picture. Christian Bale does a lot of mugging, crying and staring into space just like the director wanted. This is SS at his worst, trying to make something incredible and meaningful when it just isn't. Ordinary things are so important, why, we don't know. One pointless scene after another, almost like a bunch of MTV videos chopped up and thrown in the air and where they lay is anyone's guess. Lots of nice shots of people yelling, moving rocks, planes, etc but not a soul to be found. ZERO character development even of the main lead although we spend the entire movie with him we have no idea who he is. Jim has to be one of the most annoying children in movie history and seemingly stupid beyond belief, he seems to have no conception of reality. Avoid this unless you want to get a headache.",2,13,26,8 November 2012
American Sniper," What if the title was German Sniper instead of an American?
","In 2002 President George W. Bush said in a speech that the leader of Iraq Saddam Hussein was connected to the attacks in the US on 9/11/2001 that killed over 3000 people.The reason for attacking Iraq changed several times in an attempt to justify a war Bush had talked up since the day he took office including WMD's (that were never found), and saving the people of Iraq because Hussein was killing his own citizens (which happened ten years earlier)We were told the US would be seen as liberators and 'welcomed as heroes' by every high ranking US official.We of course now know all this was a complete lie.Now picture this: A film about a German sniper in WW2 who is full of the patriotic stuff of god and country, breaking a record for killing Polish civilians who dared to fight back against an invading army who took over their country for no apparent reason. This soldier is patted on the back for killing children and women and touted as a hero. He has no remorse and even says he enjoys what he's doing.That wouldn't be such a pleasant film would it? But what if we added that the German had a wife at home who loved him and a baby on the way? What if he had a younger brother who was in the war too that he could worry about? What about a scene where another German soldier thanked him for saving his life back in Poland?This would be a great film, for a propaganda piece in 1942 but today, to anyone who is not blindly patriotic and full of the hatred of all things Muslim it comes off as cruel and out of touch.In the film the Iraqi 'insurgents', who would be known as 'patriots' in Poland during WW2 are portrayed as all being ultimately corrupt because they don't welcome their invaders with open arms and help them kill their own friends and families. They are called evil and savages because they just don't get that Americans are there to somehow help them by destroying their country.We are supposed to feel sorry for him later when he develops a conscience of sorts although never admits he was part of a crime.Kyle was well known for his outright lies about his life including his claim that he killed 30 Americans in New Orleans during Katrina from the Superdome's roof, killing two men who tried to steal his car and of course knocking out Jesse Ventura in a bar. That last lie cost his estate $1.8 million dollars after his death. In the end Kyle is killed on a firing range, shot down by a fellow soldier much in the way he killed 160 people in Iraq.He is hailed as a hero, with flags waving and lots of tears, but I wonder if his name was Matthäus Hetzenauer instead of Chris Kyle would we feel the same?'I couldn't give a flying F about the Iraqis.' 'I hate the damn savages' said Kyle in his autobiography.",3,56,120,13 January 2015
Oblivion," Beautiful. moving and epic. Great Science Fiction
","A very high tech yet human film about one mans attempt to find out who he really is in a post war future USA. This film comes close to being a very well rounded film, but it is missing a bit of depth but it more then makes up for it in action and story. Tom Cruise has had another film that felt like this one, Minority Report, it had the same eerie feeling of being watched and of impeding doom. The one lacking part of the movie is the human survivors who are found, they are not developed very much and Morgan Freeman is little used, but this actually is OK because they are not the center of the story. The creepy chosen wife, the Tom VS Tom fight, the ships and drones are all very cool. The ending is kind of a let down and wrapped up a little too easily but over all a fun time at the movies and a film that makes you think and blink.",8,1,6,20 April 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," A timeline disaster, how could Queen screw up their own history?
","The movie itself is just OK, not spectacular in any way. The lead playing Freddie is too short, too toothy and acting too hard. But what bothers me the most is the history and facts.They have John Deacon as member of Smile.
They have them performing Fat Bottom Girls 3 years before it was written.
They have a Brazil concert on TV in 1977 that didn't happen until 1985.
The band is shown recording We Will Rock You in a scene set in 1980 when the song came out in 1977.Did the members of Queen even screen this?",5,98,158,3 November 2018
Baby Driver," Tedious, slow and ultimately moronic
","This starts out like a 20 min music video with this kid singing and dancing through the streets, turns into a bank robber movie, then a dull love story, then into a free for all.The amount of 'instant police' in this is ridiculous, no matter where they run there is another cop. The supposed 'brains' of the outfit hires total screw ups and maniacs to pull off the simplest robberies. At one point they go to get a ton of guns to rob a post office?? The whole premise is that the kid somehow owes Spacey money but when he pays up he is not allowed to get out. The ending is over the top stupid. The use of constant music is fun at first but becomes tedious.",3,87,169,13 September 2017
Divergent," Please make it end.......
","Divergent is just another teen book to film translation that only a person under 17 could care about, written by a woman in her first novel attempt and boy it shows.I have not read the book but if the film is any indication of the plot it must have been a bad read too.This story is so dull through the first hour I was begging for it to end. Nothing happened and I found myself laughing and rolling my eyes at the corny plot. The acting is wooden and you can see what's coming next by a mile.As with a lot of modern books and movies aimed at teens this one is full of nonsensical rules that people need to follow. You are born into a caste system, but then you can't choose another, and if you fail to succeed you are cast out to be a homeless person?? And if you choose different from your families group you can't see them again? Ridiculously silly stuff. Mass mind control?? The rule in today's teen movies like the Hunger Games, Harry Potter, etc is that anything goes no matter how inane and out of place. The physical challenges and mind/drug inducing is amazingly unreal. Girls fighting guys twice their size bare fisted?Isn't a divergent the same as everyone today? Don't we all have multiple skills and desires? I can imagine the 14 year old girls coming out of this movie thinking 'I'm so divergent' because I play soccer and I like silly novels about the future.",3,1,4,23 July 2014
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," ZZZ More of the same
","As with the other HP movies and one of the main reasons that adults mostly have distaste for this series is that there is really no mystery or feeling in these films. A perfect example is the bus ride in the beginning. The driver is a complete moron, and you would think that witches and wizards would have a higher standard than the humans whom they always make fun of. But it's the fact that the bus can't just be a bus, with a interesting conductor,etc. It has to travel at a ridiculous speed where everyone is flying around driven by a half blind guy, people actually sleep though it and Harry is treated like crap. Why would you want to be a part of this? Is it funny, no. Is it creative, no. Wouldn't it be easier to just drive the bus in a normal way then have to squeeze it and everyone in it to go between two other buses while going the wrong way???All I ask myself during these films is WHY? Why would they have a school book that tries to attack you, don't they have laptops in 2004 in wizard land? Why is there a maid, can't they just snap their fingers and clean the room? Why is everything so dirty and old, wouldn't wizards have the best of everything instead of no light bulbs? Why would anyone want to hang out in a world where everything breaks down, children aren't protected and even the simplest things can kill you and nothing is in the least predictable, wouldn't this world be incredibly retarded? Why would they put dangerous dementors in front of every door to protect the children, ever heard of security guards, and their the ones attacking Harry? Why is a teacher almost blind, couldn't one of the other wizards cure her? What teacher would allow a kid to fly on a giant wild chicken/horse, could you see a tiger being brought into class here?Everyone knows Serious Black is trying to kill Harry but they leave him alone by himself as they all go off on a class trip?In what world, wizard or not, would a school allow dozens of 12 year old boys and girls to all sleep together on the floor overnight? I can say I truly don't understand these movies, why are they playing a game in a lightning storm? These kids are not immortal and can be killed. It's just really dumb. And again this stupid game where you can win it completely away from the other game that's going on which really means nothing? There is a killer on the loose, dementors all over and yet the kids are all allowed to roam free where ever they want?",4,2,5,23 July 2009
The Love Guru," The Love Guru for a while wasn't listed under Mike Myers on IMDb
","I wonder why if you go to the Mike Myers title page on IMDb and look at the films he has acted in this little gem was mysteriously missing in action for a year. That said, this has to be one of the worst comedies ever made, it simply does not work on any level, all the jokes fall flat, the acting if you can call it that is atrocious and the script seemingly written by Mike when he was 8 years old. Everything that was good about the Austin Powers movies has the opposite effect here. The character is simply not interesting, likable or funny in any way, the plot makes no sense and you can see the jokes coming a mile away. A sad downturn in a good comedy career. Plus that we have all heard Myers was very hard to work with on this and it shows, no one had the balls to tell him it stunk.",1,9,18,7 January 2011
District 9," More silliness from another new director.
","I can't say I don't get what the director is going for here, a documentary style, shaky camera movements, etc, and he has us come in not at the arrival of the aliens like most films, but it has been established that they are an issue. The problem is not that the action itself or the effects are unreal but it's the plot and just basic understanding of reality that has been thrown out the window.First of all, if real aliens suddenly arrived on Earth the UN would take control of the situation (not a weapons manufacturer) in a completely controlled manner, every alien would be in quarantine and never be able to contact normal citizens. The whole idea of a shanty town for them where they interact with gangs and families is just plain stupid.Basic questions are not answered: Who is running the alien ship to keep it afloat? How can they communicate with the aliens? Why are they treating them as citizens who have to sign papers? Why would an alien have any conception of our ways of money or what's valuable? Why would an alien species want to sleep with a human woman, would you want to sleep with them? Why did they allow the aliens to acquire weapons? Why are they going door to door against creatures who are three times their strength with an approach like they are evicting old grandmas? Would you go door to door in a bad neighborhood full of gangs with drugs and weapons with three inexperienced guys and one guy with a gun??The aliens are: A) Stupid animals who are addicted to cat food. B) Super intelligent enough to create the ship and travel to Earth. C) Dumb creatures who eat rubber tires and scrounge for garbage. D) Genius chemists and weapons makers who learn to read and speak English without any lessons.(oh wait, they don't speak English, and the humans don't speak alien, wow, it's the first time in history where two cultures speak to each other in their own languages with no interpreter and understand each other)To believe in this movie is to believe that every aspect of human military and the ability to control large groups of people (which we have doing for 7000 years) has been lost and we have no idea what were doing anymore.I'm sure this film will be praised and hailed as a masterpiece by 17 year olds who for some reason today only like movies filmed in this quick edit, crazy CGI, wacky camera, no real plot style that has taken over good sci-fi. Here today gone tomorrow, about as relevant as Transformers.",3,6,14,19 August 2009
Twilight," Boooorrrring
","I know nothing of the books so this review is based simply on the film. This movie takes forever to get moving, almost as if we were watching the first part of a mini-series, but I guess that's whats coming. The characters are just dull and the story is so clichéd, mundane and just plain boring. What did the author do, read Dracula, the Ann Rice books and a few comic books and then write a new series about vampires? There is nothing creative or new here, just the same old story told through different eyes, every time someone tries to re-invent the vampire tale they all give their vamps some new skill or characteristic, here they glow in sunshine, wow.Why are they going through high school over and over again? Why can't they supposedly get home schooled it case the law asked questions, if I were 100 years old, had incredible knowledge and super powers would I be spending my time in some crappy town in high school? The parents pull the kids out on sunny days? Where would you get away with that? It never just gets sunny all of a sudden in the middle of a school day or a class trip? The baseball scene is just stupid. This was made for 14 yr. old girls so I suppose I'm being a bit picky. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ",4,3,7,6 March 2009
Zulu," ZzzzzzzzzzzZulu
","Zulu is one of those films that sound great on paper, a small troop of British regulars trapped in a land they should never have been in facing unsurmountable odds of 4000 to 100. I was able to see a new Blu-ray transfer of this good looking film and the color and costumes are wonderful, it seems like it was shot yesterday. Other then that it is over two hours of a lot of talking about how it is to be bored in the army, more talking about how they are going to stand up to 4000 Zulu warriors and some annoying talk from a minister trying to stop them. When the battle finally comes it seems like it should have been over in 5 minutes if the Zulu had just attacked with a thousand men but for some reason they send small groups into direct fire even though they killed 1200 British just the same day but now can't seem to be able to kill 100. The British side seems to keep getting more men somewhere even though you can count many dead. The blood has to be the reddest in movie history and resembles pizza sauce. We must see at least 50 guys get killed by invisible wounds, gunshots with no damage and rubber bayonets that don't even touch the enemy and a lot of bad dying acting from the Zulu extras.A dull dated film sadly.",4,10,28,15 December 2010
Django Unchained," Could have been great - A real review - not from a fan boy
","I'm a fan of QT's work, he has made some good movies, this is one of them for about an hour or so and then it slows to a crawl, is full of way too much new music and becomes a satire instead of the semi- realistic film it started out as.Christoph Waltz is brilliant and his character is well written and full of great lines. Jamie Foxx cuts a good figure, looks the part but his acting in this is bland and not memorable. QT again makes the mistake of putting himself in a cameo part to bad effect, he ruins the scene he is in and he can't act worth a damn.I guess the worst part is the lack of realism, the first half is totally believable, the second half turns into a sort of Kung Fu flying dragon mess with armies of guys on a plantation, a woman being blown back sideways by a single pistol shot from the wrong direction and Foxx blowing up an entire mansion in one shot with about 8 sticks of dynamite.The story was good and this could have been a great movie. As with the worst parts of other QT films, there is too much talking, too much music, too much pretentiousness, and it's too long by 20 mins.",6,0,5,8 January 2013
2012," Demolition Man strikes again
","Roland Emmerich's '2012' is so over the top it becomes laughable by the end of this over long mash up of every disaster film ever made. I guess the director spent a weekend watching Airport, Earthquake, The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure and decided to write them all into the most overblown eruption of CGI I have ever witnessed. Now don't get me wrong, I am all for a good 'forget your troubles' movie where you can just not have to think for two hours. But the massive barrage of effects and the sheer overwhelming amount of chaos and destruction become a distraction and you find yourself constantly thinking that it could never happen in real life. There must be 20 narrow escapes in some incredibly built automobiles and tires for that matter. There is almost no real character development so were left with just the cartoon versions of real people we have come to expect from Emmerich. We also have all the classic clichés from the disaster movie menu like showing people in different countries react using what is obviously just news footage of recent events, having to show important landmarks get destroyed, etc, etc. Think of the great movies that don't get made by filmmakers who can't get the funding to produce a project, you could have made 10 good films with the outrageous amount spent on this bloated snore fest.A list of the offenses to our intelligence:1.Why is the Mona Lisa 3 times it's real size?2.Jackson comes home early from the camping trip driving through the night then says he is late for work even though he was not supposed to be back until the next day.3.How can a radio station broadcasting from a trailer have the power to reach L.A. which is 300 miles from Yosemite.4.Gordan says he had a few flying lessons on a single engine plane but then pilots a much larger plane through the most harrowing ordeals any pilot has ever seen with no problems.5.A projectile blows away the back of the trailer (where the gas tank is) but it is able to continue.6.The proximity of explosions and the massive eruption at Yosemite would have killed them all many times over.7.Why is the Russian bringing all his cars and why would his voice recognition to start the Bentley be in English?8.The incredibly impossible coincidence of landing just miles from where they needed to be in China even though the entire continent has moved.9.The Russian plane that was out of fuel explodes in a giant fireball.10.Most major cities have been destroyed and a giant Tsunami is hurtling toward the Indian scientist and his family but he still has cellphone service. 11.They are all stuck in the airlocks that are filling with sub-freezing ocean water that just passed through the Himalayas but they all look very comfortable wearing just t-shirts and jeans.",3,3,5,16 November 2009
Kick-Ass," Disgusting
","This is one gross movie. What with the director ripping off most modern action and hero movies he has been able to mildly entertain and make you puke in one fell swoop. The sexual overtones about an 11 year old make me want to drag the director out back and show him what's funny about beating up children and dressing them in sexy outfits. This could have been an interesting spin on the anti-hero movie but the last half is so over the top and outrageous it is simply a failure. Everything that was entertaining about Kill Bill (which this garbage completely steals from) is not entertaining here. Too much death, blood and bullets leads to boredom. This is violence without remorse, feeling or purpose.A huge BOMB.NOTE- Video gamers and meat heads will love this because it hits on all their loser qualities. Something for nothing, fictitiously getting girls who are way out of their league and tough guy violence that in real life would make them pee their pants.",1,38,81,19 April 2010
Moulin Rouge!," One of the worst films ever made.
","An incredible noisy mess of a film filled with nonsensical dialog, modern music that makes no sense in the setting and acting like out of cartoons. This director is all flash over substance, seems like he directed it on 10 hits of acid. Nothing original, nothing new about it. This is a film for girls and the weak minded.Dull beyond belief. Headache inducing. You will want to shoot yourself in the head after twenty minutes. I can't imagine anyone who actually liked this and have to give it a one star to counteract the 10 star reviews by people who most certainly don't know what good movies are about.",1,4,8,13 May 2013
Caddyshack," Classic comedy
","There are few comedies that you can truly watch over and over and not be bored. This might be the tops in that category. Is it dated, yes of course, anything that is almost 30 years old is going to look different than the quality of film today but what makes Caddyshack work is that it is unique in it's ability to be both irreverent and timeless at the same time. It does not reference topical jokes or use 80's clichés so it can be watched by any generation and still be funny. I really can't stand Chevy Chase except in a few things and here he is just mildly funny and a bit pompous, but the other actors do a great job, Cindy Morgan is delicious, Rodney offers some of the best classic one liners ever, Ted Knight is hilarious and Bill Murry is brilliant as the disgusting moronic grounds keeper and has some of the most quoted lines in movie history. Is it silly, yes, does the plot wander, yes, do I care, hell no! It's in the hole!",8,1,2,11 December 2009
The Dark Knight," OK Here's an honest review...
","People here who say they hated this movie sound a little jealous? Not sure why but it is in no way a bad film although not the masterpiece the hype has built. It is filmed very well, great editing, rich colors and shadows and is light years above the two Tim Burton movies although I like them a lot (the later ones really sucked).But there are issues.HERE'S THE BAD - why is the Scarecrow in this in the beginning for like two minutes? Here he's not even the Scarecrow any more just a guy with a mask and is with a team of supposed do-gooders? Didn't he go nuts in the first movie? Kind of a pointless scene. Which leads me to another point, too many sub-plots, sub-characters, etc, which is why it runs about 20 min too long.I'm sorry but Maggie Gyllenhaal is real tough to look at. She is not a pretty lady and compared to Katie Holmes an actual dog. I hate to sound piggish but she is a distraction, I don't feel for her as a character and her acting is so sluggish and dull you almost hope she gets it to get her off the screen. One line the Joker has to her is 'hello beautiful' and 'and you are beautiful' which was laughable. Why a billionaire like Wayne who trots around with models would be into her is stupid, it's hard to believe Holmes is only a year younger.Why are they obviously in Chicago? Gotham City is NYC.Batman changes his voice so dramatically from that of Bruce Wayne's it is frankly annoying and you can barely understand him half the time. Also his character is not very interesting this time around, the action is great but he is dull as Wayne.The plot is a bit silly because of the outrageously bad police work going on, Gotham's finest seemed to be fooled at every turn, they can't keep one guy in a cell and who's ranks are so corrupted no one can be trusted, it got a bit dumb after a while.NOW THE GOOD. Heath Ledger is really great as The Joker, he puts a twist on it that is really creepy and he should get an Oscar nod, dead or not. The Joker himself is not a very threatening guy in theory but his ways and means to go to the ultimate levels of nuts made the whole film possible. Only I was disappointed with no end shot of him in the asylum in a straight jacket. Also Two Face's build up was very good, Aaron Eckhart did a fine job, but it is a little strange that he died so quick as he has been in the comics books for many a turn.All in all a fun time at the movies, well worth the price of admission. Good and dark the way batman should be.BTW This is not for kids at all, I saw several people leave during it with little kids, this is why they have ratings morons. No, your kid is not different or smarter. I mean 5 guys get killed in the first 5 minutes alone, some very brutal violence, this is not Batman circa 1967. I would say ten is old enough.",6,3,7,21 July 2008
La La Land," My god this is a boring film
","Musicals of the past left you humming the tunes as you left the theater, this is the first time I have seen a musical without a single memorable song. I'm not sure what this film is trying to be, the story is as dull as can be and the acting doesn't even really mater because it's all broken up by terrible dance numbers. I really wanted to like this and in fact did not read any reviews so I wouldn't be swayed, but it was apparent from the first number that this movie was just an extension of the terrible music that is considered popular today. It's as if they just randomly picked notes and placed words together and expected it to be good. It's the same reason why the top of the music charts are filled with sound-alike music with no feeling.The acting was wooden and the script dull.I had to rate this with 1 star just to counterbalance all the outrageous reviews calling this a masterpiece.",1,9,18,18 January 2017
Super 8," Absolutely pointless....
","I don't even know where to start on this one. When did wanting to make a movie look like something filmed in the 80's become cool? The Gooonies and several other films like it were bad then and are bad now. The child acting in this is simply annoying, they seem to be yelling out lines just for effect, a bad effect and I guess they are supposed to be funny or something but it just comes off as staged.What is this monster and who cares? We never learn anything about it other then it wants to go home, it's big and scary but has incredible intelligence which makes no sense. The sub plot of child/father relationship is boring, the over use of light flares and optical effects gets dull quick.Frankly what is the point? OK so you can make a movie that feels like it was shot 30 years ago but why? How about concentrating on the story like Spielberg films did in the past. J.J. Abrams again does what he did in Star Trek, all lights and look but no substance.",3,0,2,29 October 2011
A Clockwork Orange," Words are not enough...
","Since first discovering A Clockwork Orange in the early 80's as a teen there has been no film that captures my attention as much as this one does. I go back to it every year or so and still see things I missed the time before. The recent Bluray release was a slice of heaven. To be able to see it in such detail was amazing, from the first blink of Alex's eye to the last. The imagery is like no other film I can think of except maybe 2001. Kubrick is my favorite director without a doubt and this is his masterpiece. The acting and characters are all so memorable and scene after scene is just incredible. My only issue is a bit of a slow down in the second act but not nearly enough of a determent to give it anything less then ten stars. I believe there are two types of people when it comes to ACO, you either get it or you don't. Righty right?",10,1,4,29 November 2010
Les Misérables," Beautiful. moving but way way too long.
","The GOOD: The costumes, scenery, singing and acting were incredible. Ann Hathaway is very moving especially in her solo in the beginning. Hugh Jackman runs the range of emotions and does a great job carrying the story.The BAD: As with the stage play, it runs way too long (about 20 mins), each time you think it's over someone starts to sing again to the point where you are cringing. The only flaw as the singers were concerned is obviously with Russell Crowe who puts in a good performance, although not as good as any Inspector Javert done before, but he is given too great a task to sing these heavy tunes. He is OK, and that's does not cut it, put it this way, he would never have made the cast of the play.All in all one of the better musicals ever, though it needs some more speaking here and there to give it balance.PS: Sit in a comfortable chair.",7,1,5,1 January 2013
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Awfuly silly and dull
","I suppose as children's entertainment this film could be called good, but to anyone with a brain it is a messy, overindulged concoction of bad ideas and silly execution. I know nothing of the Potter books so this is based simply on the film. So much has been made of the books and film that I was predestined to be disappointed in some ways but little did I realize how trivial this movie is when cast against a powerhouse like The Lord of the Rings, really two completely different worlds. As with most modern tales of this type (HP) everything is so magical, everything moves (in some ways stupidly like the changing staircases) and it seemed so simple that no matter what issue that came up they all had an answer for everything. The worst part of the movie had to be the game played with balls and broomsticks. The whole point of having a separate game within a game is just retarded. Name one sport or game that has a special sideshow that can win the game at any moment? Imagine your team is about to win the Stanley Cup and their up 3 games to 1 and it's 4-0 with only a minute to go, but wait, don't forget there's a fan from each team playing a separate game in the men's room, and they just caught the golden plunger, so sorry your team has lost, too bad. Seems like JK's writing is a little on the light end don't you think? Why didn't the professor who is already through to the stone need to play the chess game like they did? What adults would announce the winners of a year long contest that meant so much to the kids, then seconds later say 'but wait, there's points that I forgot about'??? How cruel. Very childish and overrated.",4,1,3,19 July 2009
In Time," Wasted time......
","Another future/past movie where nothing is ever explained as to why the current situation is what it is and when this is supposed to take place or how people stay young. As has been done in several other movies in the future we supposedly drive cars from the past for some inexplicable reason other than the fact that they look cool on camera. There are no cell phones evident but pay phones are back in style for some reason and the device on you that holds time can be hacked by anyone even when you are sleeping, which would stop no one from just murdering you for your time. Every woman is of super model quality even in the poorest neighborhoods when it would have been much more realistic if the hotties were only with the rich. And they are telling me an Olivia Wilde of the future couldn't get someone to give her time for some favors?As for the story if you can call it that, it is full of holes some of which are blatant. In the beginning we see Will get time from the guy who wants to end his life giving him 116 years. Then he gives his friend a decade leaving him 106 years. He gives up about 1.3 years with the tolls leaving him 104.7 when he arrives in New Greenwich (we never see him pay for the limo). He then pays for the hotel (a standard room was 2 months so lets guess a suite is 6 months) so he is now at about 104.1 years.He pays for breakfast (9.5 weeks) a new tux($?) and 1 year for entrance to the casino so the most he could have when he sits down to play poker is around 103 years. Yet he calls on a 50 year bet (leaving him with 53 years) and a then another 200 years which would give him a negative -147 years yet after the bet he still has time left??? ALL IN means ALL IN.I stopped caring at that point, in a movie that is all about numbers and countdowns how could they make such a huge mistake?Then in the water we see the girl has 1040 years but after the car accident the thugs say she has a decade and make a big deal out of it.This was a silly waste of time.",4,3,9,6 December 2011
The Happening," Maybe the worst attempt at horror ever?
","God where do I start? I had heard some good reviews of this but after starting to watch it I was amazed by how bad the acting is just within the first few minutes but it got worse and worse. M. Knight's direction is almost like film school, he had one good movie and has been living off that for years. How he keeps getting money for projects is beyond me.What bothers me most is his lack of attention to any detail or simple facts. The math teacher says his Mother lives in Philadelphia but they get on a train to Harrisburg PA. which is 2 hrs West of Philly. Even if its assumed they can not get a train to Philly and must go out of their way, why would the train stop in Filbert which is 4 hrs West of and PAST Harrisburg? Then the math teacher seems to get a quick ride to Princeton, NJ but that is a 6 hr drive from Filbert on a good day not to mention the traffic you would have in a disaster. Did he even look at a map? Notice how incredibly calm everyone is in NYC with an airborne terrorist suicide plague spreading throughout the city, it would be sheer pandemonium. How do you stay ahead of the wind, as if it where a thing you could see and know which direction it's going? Most of this film is so funny that I laughed my ass off. When the girl kills herself on the cell phone, or the private yells about his gun? Pure comic genius. The worst has to be the group all viewing the lions rip off the guys arms in what looks like high def video like they were watching an episode of Jerry Springer. He seems to be trying to scare us but it is so over the top and ham handed it becomes parody. Why is an entire family sitting in a bathtub in Fla. 1500 mils from the problem? M.Kight must always try to get at least one crazy person in his movies that the normal people encounter, why is this woman at the end so insane, is this supposed to scare us?Man this is one dumb movie.",1,2,5,14 October 2008
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," More of the lame
","I was so extremely annoyed by the beginning of this movie it certainly set me off on the wrong foot. The elf/moron looked so fake (I kept thinking how good Gollum was in LOTR) and was so stupid beating himself in the head. Why is Harry back with this atrocious family? They know he is a powerful wizard yet they treat him like crap and the fat kid bullies him? HUH? Why if they hate him so much do they want to keep him instead of letting him go to school which they don't even have to pay for? Why do you need to changed gears in a flying car powered by magic? Why does it fly perfectly, then break down, then come alive? Why is there a killer tree in a school yard? Why does everything in these movies need to be alive and magic and incredibly boring all at the same time. What is the point of replanting screaming killer plants? Why would they continue to play the ball game when it is so easy for all the wizards and witches in the audience to cheat, what's the point? Why would they let children play such a ridiculously dangerous game? Why do Harry, his friends and his one enemy get called for everything in every class? Are they the only kids in the school? Very boring movie.",4,2,3,19 July 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A steaming dung heap of a movie....
","I liked the first film a little, silly stuff that sort of worked.This mess on the other hand is one of the most unwatchable films I have ever seen. First of all Megan Fox can not act, she is self conscious, boring and doesn't seem to even care. The fact that they keep panning all over her body is just sad if that's what they need to sell this garbage. The idea that Fox is dating LaBeouf is simply silly, especially the way she acts like a tramp hanging over the bike pretending to airbrush. In the real world she would be hit on 24/7 and never stay with this loser.What college doesn't allow freshman to have cars? College is optional and your paying to go there, they can't tell you if you can drive or not and how would they know? Your new roommate has a business/creepy stalking set up in your room and you are not allowed to change roommates?? They sell your mother pot on campus?? Is this fashion model school with no normal people? When did Princeton become a party school?Why would a robot cry? Why do robots from another planet have black accents and why are they ever a car during combat, aren't they faster as themselves??? The entire story about the stupid thing they need to get is distracting, implausible and moronic and there is so much action you are desensitized by it after a while.The amount of ad placement in this is nauseating. State Farm, Audi, Chevy, Cisco, etc.I couldn't even get all the way through this nonsense, not recommended unless you are 9 years old or an adult with a death wish.Michael Bay is simply the worst director in the world.",1,11,24,9 November 2009
Joker," A rip off of everything, even other DC movies.
","You've seen a lot of comparisons to taxi Driver, King of Comedy etc and rightfully so, it's pretty much the same script mashed up with some previous DC movies and Death Wish thrown in. Todd Phillips even throws in the finger gun to the head from Taxi Driver and the fake TV set from KOC, heck let's just get DeNiro too!. If you tell us it's an homage then just repeat everything it's just a completely unoriginal movie in every way. This is not the Joker, it's a made up origin story that makes the Joker a pretty dull character with both mommy and daddy issues.Answer me this, why is the Joker a 44 year old guy and young Bruce Wayne only 9? So when they fight as adults Bruce is 35 and the Joker is a 70 year old man?Having Bruce Wayne's parents be killed by a clown is just stupid.Please don't make a sequel.",3,11,43,7 October 2019
August Rush," PUKE inducing
","I really feel a bit ill after watching this drivel. I am a singer in a cover band and a film buff and this hit me on both levels. I could not stop picking it apart as to its complete lack of reality. First and foremost the music sucks, everything sounds so fake and arranged, they could not get those sounds out of battery powered amps and pig noses. He plays perfectly and invents a new way to play the guitar the first time he touches it???When he's playing on the bridge his first time out it's so awful, a rhythm part is being played while he has both hands on the upper neck of the guitar??? Quite impossible.He just starts composing after a little girl gives him a one minute piano lesson?? Then starts playing a very complicated church organ on his first sitting, which takes years to master?? This is the equivalent of speaking perfect French after someone said bonjour to you for the first time. Even Mozart's father trained him for years.Why does he even need to go to Julliard since he knows everything already? He's in school for a week, composes a symphony and has it played in Central park as the headliner? Where in the history of music has this happened? Then in another week he's conducting, another skill that takes years to learn.When he's playing in the park with his father, why is there so much sound, sustain and reverb coming out of acoustic guitars? I want me one of them magic super guitars!Then August, whose only been in NYC for a little while is able to run through subway systems, find his way to Central Park and get access to back stage where they have a tux and tails waiting for him even though he was not supposed to show.This was so obviously directed by a woman, full of 'oh it doesn't matter if it's real as long as it's beautiful' crap. And you would think as a woman she would have had a little more respect for her lead female character as to give her enough brains to ask what happened to her child? Are you saying she gave birth to a baby in a US hospital, did not have to sign one form to have it given away even though she is over 18, not one nurse or doctor said anything about the baby's health or showed it to her and there was no funeral for a supposed dead baby???This movie is a steaming pile of excrement. I always heard you couldn't polish a turd and this one proved it right.",1,65,115,1 July 2008
Kingpin," Crude, rude, silly and........hilarious
","Can't believe this isn't rated higher, I have always loved this totally silly movie since I saw it in the theater years ago. There are some lulls here and there and maybe too much character development (if that's possible) but Woody is spot on, Murry is just insanely funny with his hair don't, and the rest of the cast is great too. Ishmael's slow decline into every vice there is is great. I'm sure this is not to everyones taste and I'm glad, not all of us are into bull seamen and oral sex with old lady jokes but for those who are you will be quite content. Even the bowling is funny in this early Farrelly brothers film.",8,0,4,2 April 2011
Defiance," Did this really need to be made?
","There have been so many movies made about the Holocaust and WW2 in general that most of the stories are being retold over and over. Sometimes a great one comes along as with Polanski's The Pianist, directed by a man who was actually in the Krakow getto and lived through it. Defiance on the other hand comes across like a TV movie of the week full of second rate acting and bad dialog. Liev Schreiber is hammy and overacting his way through this and Daniel Craig is all over the place and comes off kind of strange. Of course we have all seen the typical Jews who somehow go from normal every day people to helpless hapless morons who can't even wipe their own noses. One of my biggest pet peeves is the language. Why would a group of people all from the same area all go from subtitles to English and back over and over again. I know that some Jews in this area spoke Yiddish, but not all did and it would be assumed that they did all know Russian.All in all an OK movie but OK movies should be about romance or comedy not something as serious as this. The ending is laughable - RAMBO JEWS from Hell! Plus the history is wrong in a lot of places and Ampicillin was not used until 1961.",4,18,38,2 January 2009
The Blind Side," OK family fare... not much else
","What starts out promisingly as a coming of age bio about a downtrodden kid from the bad side of town quickly turns into a semi farce replete with set up jokes and useless scenes where this boy/man can do no wrong and get's 2nd chances and preferential treatment from everyone. The first half of this film is actually good although a very over simplified covering of the subject matter.Character development is minimal, we know nothing of the motivations of the wife or her reasoning only that she has an answer for everything, nothing about the husband other than he is rich and he does whatever his wife says, and the rest of the family is made up of a pretty girl whose unlike 95% of normal teens in the fact that she doesn't question her mother bringing home a strange kid from her school to live with them, and the son is just another Hollywood wise cracking 8 yr old who speaks way above his age level and somehow has the ability to coach a football player even though his only experience has been watching it on TV. The mother is a football expert too who calls the coaches cell phone to tell him how to run the game and mouths off to racist redneck fans without any consequences. The coach is just a horrible caricature with the worst lines in the movie.We get all the typical black/white and football clichés and from there it just goes into this boring montage of ridiculously overacting college coaches promising him the world if he plays for them and of course his little brother unrealistically is in on every meeting demanding things for himself by pushing around grown men. This is interspersed with shots of his tutor (a dull Katy Bates) and teachers all seemingly on the verge of tears because they are so inspired by this kid who barely speaks. Then Michael Oher briefly turns into to a action hero and the mother into Dirty Harry who threatens drug gangs and they don't even respond because she's packing heat but so are they. Then suddenly hot young white chicks are attracted to this dorky overweight guy during his college orientation.The oddest thing is the end where they show the real Michael Oher and family simply proving to us that movies are mostly made up as the actors portraying them are twice as good looking as the real folks.I wanted to like this movie but it was so meandering and silly that it failed me early on and from there on I just wanted it to end.",5,2,5,17 December 2009
Centurion," Not a bad tale at all...
","Centurion is a tale of survival and revenge, about half way through we still don't know who we are rooting for, the all powerful Romans or the savage Picts who want to rid their land of intruders. This film is very bloody sometimes to the point of being overdone, heads explode like cantaloupes at the slightest smash yet soldiers take numerous arrows and sword lashings and survive. Probably the silliest part of the whole story was the ability of beautiful 5ft 2in 100lb girls to battle guys twice their size wielding 3ft swords. The pace of the movies is good, the action rapid if not a bit redundant, the story a bit thin but all in all a good, gritty adventure.",6,1,5,27 November 2010
The Water Diviner," Sappy and unrealistic
","A story of a man looking for his lost sons in WW1...but with SUPERPOWERS!!!First of all water divining is a hoax, it's pseudoscience and has never been proved to work. But he finds waters exact location in the middle of the Australian outback with ease. Then Crowe's character miraculously finds his dead sons bones in the middle of a huge battlefield in about a day just by FEEL. And not the general area, the exact spot.Why everyone in 1919 Turkey would speak flawless English is beyond me, especially the young boy since he would have been raised with zero English. And this would have been the language of the enemy.Crowe and an insanely hot Turkish widow make googly eyes at each for hours and her son falls head over heels for his new daddy figure which is strange because his real father died in a war fighting these same people.And obviously there is zero mention of the Armenian genocide that occurred at this time.The Turks eventually love Crowe simply because he is a great guy.",4,7,20,27 April 2015
Pitch Perfect 3," Utter nonsense..avoid this disaster
","The first PP movie was cute, the 2nd one was bad and this was just a piece of garbage. The script is stupid, the plot a mess, the acting cringe worthy. DJ Khaled's name must be mentioned 50 times, like every 2 mins, the whole idea that he would make a singer give up her last chance to sing with her group is inane, he couldn't make her a star next week? The entire back plot with Amy's dad is a distraction, her turning out to be a fat ninja even more silly. Then at the end the girls are all saying they will move on to mundane careers while Fat Amy announces she's worth $180 million, but there is no offer to make them all millionaires and still have a ton left over. These types of movies are a fun distraction sometimes, but the quality of this is more like straight to DVD. There are so many instances where the girls singing is impossible to sound the way it does, especially when Becca brings the whole group up on stage at the end with only one microphone yet it sounds like they are all mic'd.",1,11,19,18 February 2018

The bossy blonde girl, the tough girl who grows to like the nerds, the quiet girl/guy with a secret talent, the hidden lesbian, and of course the competition.The fat Amy girl is simply annoying and never funny.

It comes off so hammy and unreal. I think I was about to fall asleep about ten times.Please don't make a third one.This is what we can expect from a generation of writers who have no sense of real drama, the Harry Potter and Twilight crowd who flock to this garbage like a moth to a flame and come out raving about it.",1,196,366,12 December 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The film that changed everything...
","There are several ways to look at this film. One is 'I'm 40 years old' and it reminds me of my youth, the days before all the super crazy CGI and all the rip offs of this film and can remember a time when there was really nothing great out then as far as Sci-Fi was concerned (just look at Logan's Run today). The other is 'I'm 20 years old' and have no conception of the history of film making and have to give SW a one star rating because the effects are old or I'm just jealous that my generation does not have a film event like this and probably never will. Younger people need to realize that in 1977 there were no computers, video stores, big screen TV's, DVD's or bluray. Heck there was barely video games (were talking Pong) or VCR's and cable TV was in it's infancy. This is why kids went to see it multiple times because in 1977 movies were the big thing and we had few other ways of feeding our need for cool stuff like SW. That and the fact that the film created a new very believable world that was a great escape from the bad taste of Watergate and Vietnam, both of which were still very much in the news.I happen to fall in the 1st category I spoke of having been 10 when SW came out. I have never been a super huge fan of anything like SW or ST although I can appreciate them a lot and have seen them all but I won't be going to conventions any time soon.That said, this still has to be one of the most entertaining films ever made, it has everything you would want in a Saturday matinée cliffhanger which was what it was based on. Iconic characters, great music and action and for it's time some of the best special effects ever made. DO NOT watch the horrible redos by Lucas where he added unnecessary effects and totally ruined the feel of the film. I loved ROTJ but this one will forever be my favorite of the series.",8,0,0,31 October 2009
Moon," Great film full of talent...
","I was very presently surprised by this movie I must say. Having not heard much about it other that it was good I just sat back and let it flow over me late one night. I did not lose interest for one second during the entire film and other then the fact that it was a tad confusing when the switch came and some of the interaction between the two Sam Bells was a little trite, it moved along so well and really gave me the feeling that I was with them in their enclosed Lunar habitat. I am surprised that this was not a bigger hit and seemed to fall under the radar. This is the best thing that Sam Rockwell has ever done and except for a few images on the video screen of his wife and bosses this is a one man show, or should I say two. This might be the best example of the twins interacting trick I have ever seen. Kevin Spacey has a perfect voice for the rather sad GERTY who just wants to help if you only ask the right questions. I have read the comments that this is a 2001/Solyaris rip off but having seen both and being a huge fan of 2001 I feel it was just a bit of a tribute. No aliens here. Highly recommended.",8,0,2,11 December 2009
The Great Gatsby," Total garbage
","An incredibly noisy mess of a film filled with nonsensical dialog, modern music that makes no sense in the setting and acting like out of cartoons. This director is all flash over substance, seems like he directed it on 10 hits of acid. Nothing original, nothing new about it. This is a film for simpletons and the weak minded.Dull beyond belief. Headache inducing. You will want to shoot yourself in the head after twenty minutes. I can't imagine anyone who actually liked this and have to give it a one star to counteract the 10 star reviews by people who most certainly don't know what good movies are about.Simply ruined Gatsby, the book was never like this, but anyone under 30 will think it's cool. Rap music? Really?",1,101,177,19 September 2013
Draft Day," No one wants to be drafted to Cleveland
","This is a strange movie for many reasons...the relationships between the GM and unsigned players and his coach seem very unrealistic.No unsigned player is calling up a NFL GM on his cell phone and telling him what number to draft him at.Nor is anyone happy to go to Cleveland who hasn't won a championship since 1964 especially a first round QB pick.And no coach is setting fires in his GM's office and calling out his relationships.And no player is trashing the GM's office.No GM goes against his owners wishes on draft day...that's just sillyCostner comes off a bit bland as do most of the actors, I don't feel they really care about the script. The young players are the best of them. The whole relationship thing with his pregnant girlfriend is very boring and the mother is annoying.The film is watchable but again the acting (fans, guys around the GM, coach) all come off as acting and not natural.Must have been embarrassing for the filmmakers to have Seattle with the number one pick (worst record the year before) as they won the Superbowl by a huge margin and then have this movie come out in April 2014",5,9,18,31 July 2014
Up in the Air," Truly enjoyable
","I guess you may have to be of a certain age to fully appreciate a film like this because I think you may have to have lived a few of these scenarios to understand where the characters are coming from. I see a lot of negative reviews of this picture and I would assume that most of them are from people under 30 or even 25. The term used the most is that the film is 'boring', and I guess to a younger person who has not lived much would think a movie about a middle aged guy who loves to be in airports would be just that. I recently worked for 6 years as an adviser for a large company and had to travel almost every week here and abroad and let me tell you it gets to you quickly. One hotel becomes another and each city looks the same. I can see where Clooney's character of Ryan Bingham could learn to love it because it is how he escapes from the reality he refuses to face. He claims to not want family and a committed relationship but we begin to see that he does when he gets around his estranged sisters and falls for a mysterious woman who is his equal in not wanting to get serious, but she has different reasons. The chemistry between all the characters is great and Anna Kendrick is wonderful as the spunky newcomer who is a reflection of Ryan when he was young. What I liked best was that the movie does not end on a high note, no sappy wrapped up happiness. He gets screwed and has no one, it's the bed he chose to lie in and now it is all he has. The character of Ryan Bingham is an instant classic, a modern Willie Loman if you will, who's failures make us feel better about ourselves.",7,1,4,20 January 2010
