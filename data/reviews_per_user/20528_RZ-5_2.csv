Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The first part of destroying a legend
","At first I must admit that I am not a Star Wars fanatic, so I do not walk with Darth Vader helmets on my head or wear Luke Skywalker T-shirts. But ! I loved that movie, all three parts. This Episode I is just miserable and it's only because of high expectations around it. It's only boring (there's no story at all) but after half an hour I was fed up with those awful lot of disgusting and annoying creatures, with the stupid wisdoms about the Force and the Jedis. I expected an exciting movie and it almost made me go home just after the beginning. Technically it was perfect, the visual and the sound effects were amazing, but this movie should have been a five minute demo film of Dolby Laboratories Inc. rather than a Star Wars episode. But it's all about making money and people should understand that; after the brilliant trilogy everyone wants to see this Episode one, so everyone buys the ticket, so financially it is a great success, no doubt about it but as a film this is a shame.",1,1,2,30 September 1999
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," No comment...
","I just accidentally watched this movie in a small cinema, but I think there are two groups of mentally sick people, the first is who make films like this, the second is who enjoy them and feel some exceptional artistic deepness.",1,73,150,30 September 1999
