E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
","If it is possible for a single shot to sum up an entire film, the shot of the bicycle racing across the moon does that for 'E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.' For those who were introduced to 'E.T.' during their childhood, the film will always offer an unparalleled nostalgia. Spielberg wisely sets the film in American suburbia, a place where many of us feel instantly at home. It is here we are introduced to the family E.T. will soon call his, loving headed by single mother Dee Wallace. Of course, besides E.T. himself, the true stars here are the children (Drew Barrymore, Robert MacNaughton, and Henry Thomas). Precocious Barrymore offers innocence and humor to every scene she's in and Thomas, as our hero Elliott, brings maturity far beyond his years to the screen. Who would have imagined that one of the most affecting relationships ever captured on film would be that between a little boy and a visitor from outer space? Special effects are certainly essential to this movie, and Spielberg is unquestionably a master of them, but for the movie to work, we can't simply look at E.T. and ask, 'How'd they do that?' We have to feel the same connection with him Elliot feels. And we do. We sense the homesickness in E.T.'s over-sized eyes. We marvel as he gives life to a flower and puts on a magic show with a model of the solar system. We delight in his fondness for Reese's Pieces. We instinctually know that his glowing red heart is so very good. And when he asks to phone home, we are touched more than seems natural for three little words. I don't cry easily at films. Very few, including those about the most disheartening tragedies, actually bring me to tears. I'm not at all ashamed to admit that 'E.T.' is one which did. While displaying more profundity in numerous ways, 'E.T.' never forgets its roots as a science-fiction film. Though sci-fi doesn't necessarily require this, many films in the genre deal with the sky and what exists beyond it. Back at the turn of the century when film was still in its infancy, one of the first sci-fi features, Méliès' 'A Trip to the Moon,' featured space exploration as its theme. 'The Thing from Another World,' cult classic of the 1950s, offered its classic warning 'Watch the skies!' However, 'E.T.' is different from these and other like films. As opposed to driving the plot with conflict between creatures from different worlds, 'E.T.' allows them to exist as friends. Science-fiction films are successful when they capture an audience's imagine. 'E.T.' certainly does. But in many scenes it goes beyond that, such as when that bike soars across the moon. It makes our hearts soar too.",10,2,4,10 December 2006
Casablanca," Casablanca
","No film captures the classical Hollywood style quite so well as 'Casablanca.' The film seamlessly combines romance and intrigue in its exotic location, remarkably conveyed by mere studio sets. The black and white cinematography is perfect for capturing and adding mood to the smoke filled rooms, war torn city streets, and foggy airports that compose the world of this film. Despite seeming a product of its time, 'Casablanca' is truly a timeless piece of entertainment. It would be futile to recount the plot here. Even those who have never seen the film are likely to be aware that 'Casablanca' is the film where Ingrid Bergman is forced to chose between old lover Humphrey Bogart and her resistance leader husband (the often overlooked Paul Henreid). Bergman as Ilsa Lund, the center of the love triangle, is magnificent here. She communicates with such ease the very different types of love she feels for each man in her life, and we sympathize with her struggle. Of course, Bogart too created a legendary performance as café owner Rick Blaine. Seeing him transform from the man who will stick his neck out for nobody to someone content with making a great self-sacrifice is one of the joys of the film. Bogart and Bergman are leading players among equals however, and are rightly matched by numerous character actors, not the least of which is Claude Rains. In his portrayal of French Vichy officer Captain Renault, he hits the perfect notes to show off both the corrupt and goodhearted sides of the character. He also gets to deliver some of the film's best comedic one-liners. Another unforgettable actor is Dooley Wilson as the congenial piano player Sam, who of course provides the quintessential rendition of 'As Time Goes By'. Director Michael Curtiz certainly does these fine actors justice. The film has some striking visuals too. Be on the lookout for the raindrops on a letter which look more like tears, and the symbolism provided by a bottle of water towards the film's end. Viewers aware of the many troubles that plagued the production of 'Casablanca,' should be amazed at the manner in which the film as a whole is able to so greatly transcend the sum of its parts. When you pause and really consider it, 'Casablanca' is a much simpler film than many others also hailed as classics. It was based on an unremarkable (and unproduced) stage play, shot on a modest budget, and released with the thought of the natural appeal it would carry for its wartime audiences. And yet it has endured so long beyond that. Much has been made on the subject of reading 'Casablanca' as a political allegory, with Rick representing isolationist America, Lazlo the Free French, so on, and so on. This rightfully compels the film student in me. But in all actuality, the romantic in me is much more captivated by the story of three little people caught up in the problems of a crazy world. The nuances of the characters, the sense of urgency ominously hanging over every scene, and the tear jerking story of love lost, found, and lost once more in the name of a bigger cause are the elements that stay with us. For me, as well as countless other film lovers around the world, the first viewing of 'Casablanca' proves to be the start of a very beautiful friendship.",10,11,19,5 December 2006
Mulholland Drive," Mulholland Drive
","The first time you see 'Mulholland Drive,' the most you can do is experience it. The second time, you'll notice more and perhaps a few pieces will fall into place. You can expect more of this the third time you see it. And the fourth. How many viewings does it take to get to the heart of 'Mulholland Drive?' One wonders if it's a possibility. On a more serious note, what some would argue as David Lynch's best film, is a film rich in atmosphere, symbolism, and existential ideologies. The plot, which is still highly debated and theorized among film buffs, revolves around two women: an exotic amnesiac (Laura Elena Harring) and a bright-eyed ingénue (Naomi Watts) just arrived in a stylized and mystical Hollywood. Together, they investigate a mystery that encompasses a car crash, a locked box, a decaying corpse, and a purse full of money. Characters come and go and scenes flow from one to the next, with barely any concrete thread holding them together.Lynch proves fearless in ignoring convention and throwing linear storytelling to the wind. He's not alone in his dexterity, however. Naomi Watts gives the best performance I've ever seen in the movies here. Lon Chaney, character actor of the silent era, has been fondly nicknamed, 'The Man of a Thousand Faces.' For her work here, Watts should be dubbed, 'The Woman of a Thousand Faces of a Single Character.' She plays her ingénue with a range of depths that surpass anything we might expect. In the body of the film, she is clearly its heart and soul. There are no doubt those who will be offended by this film. Perhaps they'll think it's too graphic, too artsy, or too intellectual. They would be right. This isn't a film for everyone. But for those attuned to the graphic, artsy, and intellectual aspects of film, 'Mulholland Drive' is surely one of the most rewarding viewing options out there.For those with the perseverance to work at understanding 'Mulholland Drive,' there will come a time when they begin to suspect that most of the film's spectacle and eccentric happenings are merely pawns, artistically manipulated to tell a tragically human story. I think this is correct. 'Mulholland Drive' is something of a paradox in that it has to be complex and illogical to so truthfully tell its story. After all, the human thought process is one of the greatest complexities in existence and that's essentially what this film is seeking to represent. And it succeeds. It has to, otherwise viewers would never be willing to invest the time necessary to decipher it. All I can suggest is this: see it again. And again. See it until you understand it. And when that time comes, be prepared for it to break your heart.",10,14,24,3 December 2006
Halloween," Halloween
","The opening credits of 'Halloween' scare us. No action commences until they have finished and yet, even before the first real image of the film comes on the screen, we are filled with a sense of dread. We know the movie we are about to see is going to frighten the hell out of us. This is in thanks to the fantastically eerie score written by John Carpenter himself, coupled with the camera's inching forward towards a flickering jack-o-lantern. He sits there with that disquieting grin during the film's title sequence, as though taunting us, daring us to watch this movie. From there, we are treated (although I suspect that's really not the right word) to a prologue done entirely in a continuous point-of-view shot of the killer. We are given no choice but to go with him, and from his vantage, witness what is easily the most heinous act in the film. After this, we are given virtually our only momentary reprieve in the unrelenting suspense this film is able to sustain. Even when nothing ominous is in sight, we can't shake the feeling that it is waiting just outside our peripheral vision, ready to attack at the most opportune moment. This sense doesn't lie, as the film features numerous 'jump scenes' which are all too effective. Surprisingly for this type of film, 'Halloween' is devoid of any actual gore or scenes of carnage. Carpenter uses this to his advantage. He knows that blood would let us off too easily. It would allow us to be disgusted, thus focusing our attention on something besides the persistent terror. Some horror movies go for visceral thrills and some manage to engage our inner psyches. 'Halloween' does both. The film was made by a group of young filmmakers with such 'Let's put on a show!' type attitudes that none of its elements show any sign of pretension. I think that's why it works. We believe it. I realize I've yet to discuss either the plot or characters of 'Halloween.' They are both so basic and straightforward, they almost seem inconsequential when discussing the film's impact as a whole. Of course, the performances are very good. Jamie Lee Curtis is pitch perfect as girl-next-door Laurie Strode, the heroine you love to root for. And Donald Pleasence, as Dr. Sam Loomis, gives the whole thing a further air of credibility. And there is another character too. Michael Meyers is obviously now an icon in the horror genre, but it's really quite amazing when you think of how little you see him in this first installment of the franchise. He has such little screen time and yet his presence is felt constantly. The filmmakers deserve high praise for this, among their many other achievements. In seeking to make a simple thriller, they made a genre-defining classic. I think it's best when viewed on these same terms. Unlike some, I've decided never to try and ascertain what exactly Michael Meyers represents. I prefer to stand firm in my rather simple conviction: I never want him stalking me.",9,8,11,6 December 2006
