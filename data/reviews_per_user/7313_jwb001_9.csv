Vertigo," I wish my heart were in San Francisco
","The movie tells a fine story at an easy pace, like a pleasant read of a novel.Its camera angles are fresh. Although countless other movies and television shows have been set in San Francisco, Vertigo gives us new scenes (e.g. the garden of Mission Dolores, exterior and interior of Palace of the Legion of Honor fine arts museum, the huge Brocklebank Apartments building, the old house known as 'McKittrick's Hotel', Fort Point beneath Golden Gate Bridge, etc. etc. etc.). San Francisco feels fresh again.Excellent character development... maybe the best I've ever seen in a film.On the negative side:1. John Ferguson's infidelity - how distasteful. Combined with the words 'Mother's here' from his longtime girlfriend Midge and Ferguson's obsession with Judy, this movie's love theme comes off as a creepy, perverted love.2. Ferguson's dream sequence is so amateurishly done - it's almost laughable.3. The second half of the film is tedious, lacking visual freshness.4. Many critics refer to Hitchcock as the master of suspense, but in this film, he fails to deliver. It contains only a few conundrums with minimal emotional intensity.5. Judy's ending is contrived, inexplicable.",6,1,3,29 January 2016
Chinatown," Winner in the category 'Waste of talent'
","What a horrible film!1. This film insinuates that Chinese people are corrupt even though they have almost no involvement in the plot.2. Zero criminal consequences for corruption in this film3. Roman Polanski, the director, predicts his sexual perversions with a 13-year-old girl via this film; one of the main characters is an evil, powerful man who impregnates his own daughter also with zero criminal consequences.The only redeeming quality--the film recreates the 1930s setting wonderfully.",2,9,28,30 January 2016
Citizen Kane," A rosebud by any other name...
","Positive1. Wonderful storytelling of Kane's life.2. Like most classic films, the dialog is perfectly clear to understand.Negative1. In the opening scene, when Kane utters his last, dying word, I immediately knew the denouement of the entire film. This film is such a classic, and that word so renowned - any suspense has disappeared long ago.2. The final scene, which reveals the meaning of 'Rosebud', is very weakly presented; it's almost anticlimactic.",6,0,2,2 February 2016
The Battle of Algiers," History repeats itself
","EXCELLENT, PROPHETIC MOVIE !!!Released in 1967, this movie provides a clear insight into the roots of Islamic 'radicalization' as a reaction against the poverty, exploitation, corruption, and degradation caused by colonialism.Several shocking ideas (for a film from 1956):1. A large group of seven-year-old boys beat a drunk to death to 'improve their community'2. French police take vigilante justice against an innocent man's family by exploding his home late one night3. Revenge bombings by Muslim females of an Air France flight and two caf√©s (not suicide bombings, incidentally)4. French military uses waterboarding (I kid you not) and other tortures to extract information, 'false flag' events (World Trade Center, anyone?) to justify circumventing laws, and 'suicides' to eliminate 'non-cooperative' rebel leaders.5. The United Nations, as usual, is impotent.Combined with any good documentaries about the history of African-Americans and the history of Native Americans, an astute viewer comes to the realization that Europeans are the devils who have brought misery to peaceful people throughout the world.",10,0,4,30 January 2016
The Intouchables," Philippe and Driss don't take life seriously - why should you?
","Before writing my review, I read through reviews by critics. Let me deal with the bleeding-heart liberals first. They fault the film for everything from racism to 'too light a treatment' of the 'wider implications'. Sheez--chill out. Here's a joke for you...Q: What's a critic who gave this movie a bad review? A: A critic who is too sanctimonious to simply write, 'Very enjoyable film'.I've watched the movie twice now, once with my wife before I started to write user reviews on IMDb and two days ago with my younger son, during which I didn't log critiques or interesting quotes as I would while watching a movie by myself. Very enjoyable film !!!Only two minor criticisms:* Lame title (no pun intended). 'Intouchables' is too close to 'Untouchables'. Somebody really could have devised a better title.* When I first watched the movie, I didn't empathize with Driss' departure to look after his 'brother', Adama. This portion of the film needs sharper lines through more specific events and dialog.",9,0,0,27 January 2016
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," I saw what you did, and I know who you are
","Very, very unwise decision to cast such a familiar star as Brad Pitt in the role of a historical person, specifically Jesse James.In this film, whenever the audience sees the Jesse James character on the screen, they see Brad Pitt, not Jesse James. Consequently, they experience zero immersion in the film.I had a similar problem with Brad Pitt in the film 'Inglourious Basterds' (is it just a coincidence that both films have such cheesy titles? 'the Coward'? incorrectly spelled 'Inglourious' and 'Basterds'? Come on!)By contrast, when I watched the films 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'Django Unchained', I didn't know the characters Col. Hans Landa and Dr. King Schultz respectively are both played by Christoph Waltz. He gets so deeply into his roles that he actually becomes the character, winning a 'Best Supporting Actor' Oscar in both cases. What an excellent actor!!! (Maybe that explains Brad Pitt's problem; he has never won an acting Oscar.)",1,2,5,2 February 2016
The Dark Knight," Excellent, but far short of the fanfare
","Beginning with 'Batman' (1989), I never watched any of the Burton / Nolan films because 1) I avoid franchises where the public responds like a herd of crazed sheep, and 2) the Batman movies, in particular, exuded a darkness so deep that I refused to allow my psyche to get sucked into the abyss.When my younger son asked me to watch with him, I agreed. In this situation, though, I didn't log critiques or interesting quotes as I would while watching a movie by myself. Here are highlights that I retained by memory:* No Robin. Hmmm.* 'Tumbler' Batmobile and Batpod motorcycle initially stun the audience with their speed (a simple film production trick), yet they lack creative ingenuity compared to the plethora of devices found in the Batmobile from the 1960's television series.* Heath Ledger's performance as Joker doesn't match its hype accumulated over the years. Excellent--yes. Contributed to his death in real life???--one example of why I avoid franchises where the public responds like a herd of crazed sheep.Not sure whether Joker's hunched-over gait works. Rather than adding to his persona as a 'maniacal criminal mastermind', whenever I saw the drooping shoulders, I felt a tinge of condescending pity for him. Would have preferred to feel 100% abject fear.=====The movie begins to drag after Joker's visit to District Attorney Harvey Dent in the hospital. The kidnapping of Commissioner Gordon's family and all surrounding events should have hit the editing room floor.",6,0,2,26 January 2016
Invincible," 4th down and 17 yards to go for this film
","Lots of problems with this film:* Feels too formulaic. The director just went through the motions to get the film done without putting in extra effort to make it distinctive.* Unnecessarily depressing until the final scene. Depressing dialogue. Worst of all - the color of scenes in South Philadelphia is filtered to produce a depressing brown tint in a misguided attempt to 'set the mood'.* Weak character development. Vince and the budding romance with Janet are handled well. Johnny, who is Vince's nemesis, feels formulaic again. The bar owner Max and the other neighborhood buddies, whose names I can't even remember - that gives some indication of the weak character development - seem two dimensional at best.The only redeeming aspect of this film is its 1970s rock soundtrack.",4,1,2,29 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Jaw-dropping film
","For two hours, I watched this film with awe and admiration.Complaints1. As I watch this film, I feel like I'm playing the RPG 'Dungeon Quest'. The story is 'on a rail'. To accomplish an uncompleted quest, we must go back the exact same way that we came. Not much thought involved. Not much freedom to explore the map. Just action 'on a rail'.2. I could never get the colors right. Reds are excessively red. Yeah, it's intentional. However, if my color settings work for every other video, why should I need to make major adjustments, without ultimate satisfaction, for this film?",8,2,9,28 January 2016
