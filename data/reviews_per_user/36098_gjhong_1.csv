Sucker Punch," see it before it disappears
",'contains spoiler' This movie is about courage and loyalty. The opening narration tells you about the reality of guardian angels and soon we arrive at the Lennox Asylum for the Insane. The newest inmate is 'Baby Doll' who has been driven mad by a tragedy. We overhear her evil stepfather conspiring with an orderly to get her brain lobotomized. In her madness she sees the asylum as a brothel where she will be sold to someone called the High Roller. She decides to escape and is helped by four girls. For some reason their escape attempts are represented by fighting fantasy adventures.We spend most of the movie in her delusion. Towards the end it is implied that her adventures are based somewhat on reality. So failing these fantasy missions means something didn't work out in real life.We are told at the end what events actually happened. I suggest that you watch this as soon as possible before it disappears. The CGI looks fantastic on a big screen.,8,2,6,4 April 2011
