Moneyball," Moneyball's appeal to a mass market audience trades depth and meaning for a feel good underdog story
","Baseball is the sport to follow if you love numbers. Almost every aspect of the game can be and is quantified by a percentage which both ball clubs and fans use to rank players. The science of ranking players using particular categories, specifically on base percentage, is the foundation for an analysis program known as sabermetrics. Moneyball never uses this term, but that is what they are talking about. Moneyball tells the story of the Oakland Athletics' 2002 season. At the end of 2001, the A's lost the divisional playoff series to the Yankees and then their three superstars left for free agency. Compared to the Yankees and the vast majority of the rest of Major League Baseball teams, the Oakland A's were poor. They could not compete with the other clubs to put well known impact players on their roster. General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) pleaded with his scouts to come up with a new way to identify players instead of the usual way it had been done for the past hundred years or so, mostly gut instinct and the usual power numbers. While in Cleveland on a bartering trip to replace the holes in his lineup, Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), a low level player analyst, who has some unconventional ideas about what it really takes to win games. To win games, you have to produce runs. To produce runs, you have to get on base, be it with hits or walks. Scouts and baseball crowds prefer hits since they are far more sexy than walks; however, they are one in the same to Peter Brand and Billy Beane quickly becomes an acolyte to this new way of thinking. Shifting focus to the most undervalued players in baseball, Oakland starts signing guys who are considered too old, sub-par fielders, and unimpressive at the plate. Not only does the scouting staff start to revolt, but the coach, Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) looks at Billy and his methods like they are from Mars.Sabermetrics was not new in 2002, but no ball club ever put a team together using mostly stats before. Everybody expected them to lose, be at the cellar of their division, and for Billy to be fired at the end of the season. However, the 2002 season went in a different direction and produced some profound ripple effects throughout the rest of the league and how teams valued players afterwards. Moneyball is definitely a film for baseball fans and stat geeks. However, if you are not into baseball, you most likely will not enjoy Moneyball very much. There is limited on field action and a lot of detailed conversations about baseball methods with its corresponding jargon.Moneyball is based on a 2004 book and is advertised as the true story of what happened in that 2002 season; however, there are a lot of dramatizations and changes. First of all, there is no Peter Brand in real life. In fact, Billy's Assistant General Manager joined the team in 1999 and was named Paul DePodesta. Mr. DePodesta did not like how they wrote his character in the script and asked that his name be changed. He argues that he was not only focused on statistics to shape the team. I desperately wanted Moneyball to be an amazing film. I love baseball and I really enjoy reading and talking about baseball stats. Unfortunately, Moneyball is not a great movie, it is just OK. It lacks a certain weight and depth. Early scenes between Pitt and Hill could have been much deeper concerning their ideas to change the way the game is played, but they are light and choppy. Peter Brand never really gets a long monologue to explain just how his ideas could create a winning team from start to finish. Furthermore, the character of Coach Howe is ridiculous. Philip Seymour Hoffman spends his very limited screen time hurling out one word guttural answers and just looks ill. I know he was meant to disagree with the way the team was headed, but why make him look deathly pale and on the verge of a nervous breakdown? See Moneyball if you are a baseball fan; you will enjoy the behind the scenes look at the scouting meetings and the shenanigans which go on at the trade deadline. However, be prepared for a light fiction film which can stray pretty far from what really happened that year.",6,3,5,10 October 2011
The Avengers," The superheroes have the right script and the right director, but the villain does not pack the punch they need to truly become The Avengers
","After setting it up with multiple films about how the individual characters gained their super powers, The Avengers finally brings together all of the heroes in one story to either work together as team to defend Earth or fight amongst each other aided by their massive egos and verbal bravado. Perhaps never before in cinema history have there been so many movies released as prequels to set up the eventual crown jewel. Batman and Superman only met in the comics, not on the big screen. The Avengers appears to be sort of a test case to see if so many leading superheroes can all share the same screen.While all six characters each receive a certain amount of on screen time and side story, some are pushed more into the foreground than others. As Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is a fan favorite and is always handy with a funny quip, he is front and center along with Captain America (Chris Evans) who even though does not have much of a super power, places himself in a sort of leadership role within the group. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and the two characters that did not get their own films, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all fight for the leftover screen time in the background. The puppet master is Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who spends most of his effort in sheep dog mode herding these guys from their billion dollar towers or their self-imposed exile.So what possible threat is great enough to require the efforts of six superheroes? Eh, it's just Loki (Tom HIddleston); Thor's adopted brother who has a chip on his shoulder. He zooms down to Earth with greasy hair, a ridiculous hat, and the backing of a large and formidable alien Army known as The Chitauri. Countering Loki would seem like a job for just Thor or just Iron Man, not the catalyst for The Avengers to finally come together as a team. Ah, but here is where the film really takes off. Most of these super beings are not team players. Iron Man's ego is way too big to share space with somebody else, the Hulk does not trust himself to walk down the street, and Captain America can't believe these prima donnas represent the future America which remains quite strange to him. Entrusted with helming this new and star-studded film is Joss Whedon, the brains behind Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Angel. He has only directed one movie before this, the wonderful Serenity. I would have guessed the studio would go with a more experienced director; however, Whedon has proved before he is more than capable with this type of material. I'm not talking about action movies, but the verbal sparring, witty conversational scenes, and complicated story which must make a lot of room for almost too many characters. Whedon brings his trademark strengths with him including humor. When you think of The Hulk, the words humor and ironic laughter do not pop up in the first 20 adjectives to describe him, but in The Avengers, The Hulk becomes the most amusing character to watch which is all due to Whedon's skill. There are a few details which do not work as well as others which hurt the film's appeal a little bit. To bring The Avengers together and mold them as a team requires a tremendous villain; however, Loki is not that guy. He is more of a villain's sidekick or henchman rather than the main baddie. Then there is Nick Fury's helicarrier which can also cloak itself and appears to be an upgrade, but direct rip-off of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. Oh, and Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill was the absolute wrong casting choice for her role. An unknown actress is always better for a supporting role because every time she was on screen, all I could see was Robin from How I Met Your Mother. Those are just details though. Whedon shows he was able to weave together a complex sextet of superheroes and take them through the difficult process of becoming a team. For simplicity's sake, some heroes are featured much more than others, but any other script and director would have made the same choices. The Avengers is very good during its climactic fight scene where all of the plot threads come together, but Loki as the villain is just not up to the challenge. Hopefully, whatever sequels come down the line are able to up the ante a little bit.",7,0,5,11 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Holmes vs. Moriarty exchanges are captivating; the same cannot be said for Holmes & Watson
","Even though there are now two films in Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes, I am still getting accustomed to the athletic, street fighting Holmes as opposed to the merely cerebral genius who used to chase suspects by horse and buggy rather than bash their brains out in back alleys. In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the villain is more formidable, the action consumes more screen time, and the jokes are more cringe inducing. Sherlock (Robert Downey Jr.) has noticeably upped his drug habit with side references to cocaine and routinely drinks embalming fluid rather than boring old brandy.Why the sudden surge for uppers? First, Sherlock is matching wits with Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). Moriarty appears to match Holmes man to man intellectually; however, he has follows no moral code or displays any hint of empathy whatsoever. This makes his the most dangerous man in Europe. I will not divulge any plot points concerning his evil deeds because that is half the fun of a Sherlock story, following the trail as he discovers clues which lead him to the next location. Second, Dr. Watson (Jude Law) insists on going through with his marriage, a prospect Sherlock frequently reminds him will destroy his manhood and shatter his well-being.Sherlock's interactions with these two characters, Moriarty and Watson, define the high and low ends of this film. When Sherlock and Moriarty share the same room, real tension emanates from the screen. Their verbal sword play is a credit to the writing and the actors who joust for tactical advantage just by using metaphors. Two scenes between these men jump to mind. Early on, Sherlock analyzes Moriarty's handwriting while Moriarty warns Sherlock of the dangerous path he is following. I will not describe a later scene between the two gentlemen, but it is the most effective in the film as they mentally assail one another.The low and tedious end is Sherlock's interactions with Watson. The relentless double entendres about their 'relationship' lead the audience to question whether or not Sherlock is homosexual. For a wisecrack or two, this would provide levity and amusement. Unfortunately, the script persistently wails against this dead horse of a joke. A homoerotic double meaning pops up about every 30 seconds when Sherlock and Watson share the screen. It soon grows dreary and began to test my patience, especially during an extended sequence with Sherlock in drag.What always ends up bringing the script back on track is what Sherlock is known for, his fascinating method of deductive reasoning. Before he makes a move, the script may flash forward as he meticulously plans his next position in a street brawl or it may flash a few minutes back in time to show the audience just how he set up the bad guys to fail. Sherlock is always one step behind Moriarty who regularly seems to be the smarter of the two; however, if you are the individual planning the executing the scheme, those following you will always appear to be lagging behind you.I slightly recommend this new Sherlock mainly for the enjoyment of the Sherlock vs. Moriarty moments and the fascinating moments when Sherlock pauses to explain the situation to someone (usually the audience) as to what and why he is taking a particular course of action. I hesitate to strongly recommend this film because of the awful dialogue between Sherlock and Watson and because of the standard Guy Ritchie cinematography style. Guy Ritchie is known for inventive and momentum shifting action scenes. Sometimes bullets fly faster than the speed of light and then shift to 'Matrix' time sothe audience can watch it pierce someone's clothing. Shifting between fast and slow motion in action sequences is helpful to determine the placement of good and bad guys, but after a particular amount of time, these shifts become significantly noticeable where instead they should be only slightly perceptible. When the third or fourth action sequence began, I was prepared and expected the momentum shifts which instead of drawing me into the scene actually had the opposite effect and took me out of it.There are certain expectations and pitfalls a second film in a series runs into. Will it have the same mood and presence as the first film? Is it just there to take up space to make it a trilogy? In A Game of Shadows, Sherlock's character is a bit more interesting because of the drug habit and especially because of the villain; however, Watson is beginning to draw eye rolls instead of applause as the sidekick.",6,10,18,28 December 2011
The Hunger Games," Intriguing and creative material gets bogged down in underwritten script; however, Jennifer Lawrence shines
","I always wonder after seeing a movie where I have read the book beforehand, 'Would I have liked this better had I not read the book?' Anybody who has read a book later turned into a film is naturally going to be biased concerning the story. They know how much deeper the material goes, the character back stories, and the scenes which did not make the final cut. They may still critique the filmmaking objectively, but not the story/plot.I read The Hunger Games before seeing the movie. I know that in Panem, an all controlling fascist regime based out of the Capital controls 12 districts in an extremely oppresive manner. In District 12, the proletariat meagerly scrapes by through mining coal and make up for the rest of their harsh existence through scavenging and bartering. To atone for a previous rebellion, every year each District must send one male and female aged 12-18 to the Capital to fight each other to the death. These are the Hunger Games.Katniss Eberwine (Jennifer Lawrence), at 16 years old, is her family's breadwinner. After her father was killed in a mining accident, her mother sunk into a sort of catatonic shock, so Katniss was forced to use her hunting and archery skills to eke out a minimal existence for her mother and her younger sister. It is technically illegal to hunt outside the District's wire perimeter, but Katniss is adept at evading the sensors and also has a partner in crime with her friend Gael (Liam Hemsworth).On Hunger Games selection day, known as the Reaping, Katniss's small 12 year old sister, Primrose, is selected against all odds. In an act of selfless protection, Katniss jumps forward to volunteer in her place. Joining her on the stage as the male representative is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the baker's son and somewhat of an acquaintance of Katniss. Also along for the ride is District 12's Capital representative Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and a drunken former Hunger Games winner, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who will serve as the mentor for Katniss and Peeta in the games.This plot description sounds a bit thin but it is truly intriguing. The idea of 24 teenagers running around the woods spearing each other with swords, arrows, or even their bare hands has a particular voyeuristic element to it. Unfortunately, to make sure they wrenched all of the millions they could out of the audience, the filmmakers kept this at the PG-13 level. The violence and ensuing deaths just look silly at this sanitized level. Unlike the book, the dread is absent. Furthermore, the characters are stock and one-dimensional; yes, as opposed to the book.In the novel, Peeta's motivations and back story concerning Katniss are finely woven into the story and given a lot of weight. However, in the film, you cannot guess if he is sincere or just trying to play the game. In the book, little Rue (Amandla Stenberg) is a very young and tiny waif from the agricultural district whose impact is deeply felt by the reader. In the movie, Rue fills her requisite squares, but fails to make anywhere near the same impact. I am not sure quite where to put my finger on it, but there is something really missing from this movie.No character gets their due. What I mean is, the plot is faithfully followed, but there is no oomph, no driving force. Katniss comes the closest, but that is just because she is in almost every scene. Jennifer Lawrence has done a very good job here bringing Katniss to life and making her appear scared for her life, which she truly is. Just before her platform rises to begin the Hunger Games, she visibly shakes with fear. Lawrence was even better in Winter's Bone where she really turned in a mesmerizing performance. The biggest disappointments are Panem's dictator and Peeta. These two characters could have added so much depth to what is actually a very light and breezy Hunger Games. If you are familiar with this story, light and breezy should be the last two adjectives which come to mind.A film should be judged on its own irrespective of whether or not you have read its original material. In that respect, The Hunger Games is a very creative story which is underserved by its meek script and borderline boring filmmaking. Material of this caliber (and budget) deserves so much more.",5,17,29,26 March 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Carell & Moore have chemistry & a great script; Gosling & Stone do not
","Crazy, Stupid, Love is naturally about relationships. The one which consumes most of the film focuses on Steve Carell and Julianne Moore who have been married for a very long 25 years. They are stuck in a rut. They look exhausted and seem to just be going to through the motions of their monotonous relationship. In fact, they are getting a divorce. Carell moves out and immediately finds the local bar. It is here that Ryan Gosling notices him as a very sad case of a man and assumes a Fairy Godmother role of personal improvement. He initiates new clothes, a new hairstyle, and a new way of thinking on the newly single and confused Carell.Most of this seems like a standard run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, which for some part it is. But the script is a bit savvier than to just throw formulaic plot movements at the audience. The chemistry between Carell and Moore works. Carell reminds you of his Dan in Real Life character a bit and both actors really show a weight on their shoulders which their marriage has become. What does not work is the Ryan Gosling situation and how he latches on to Carell. The motivation is lacking and the script really never bothers to explain it. Naturally, the womanizing Gosling meets and falls for Emma Stone and this relationship does not work either although they share a quality late night scene together. In fact, the Emma Stone character dangerously approaches Sweet Home Alabama territory as she throws away a decent guy (Josh Groban's first film appearance) for the womanizing chauvinist.Unfortunately, what was once a real and tough script at points collapses into farce and a Three's Company misunderstanding at the film's climax and becomes so unbelievable that I was a bit sad that Carell and Moore's marital problems are reduced to stock slapstick. Another let down is the inclusion of Marisa Tomei in the cast. It has nothing to do with her character, but what is Tomei doing in such an underwritten and one dimensional role? I thought her acting comeback in The Wrestler would have saved her from something as minimal as this.On one hand, I praise this script for probing much deeper than the average insipid rom com. However, it severely plummets at key points and in a conniving manner manipulates certain characters which spoil its originality and wit. Also, what is going on with the movie poster? That particular scene in no way whatsoever represents this film. This was a particularly poor choice by the advertising department.",5,4,6,12 August 2011
Midnight in Paris," Here's to Golden Age Syndrome
","Midnight in Paris is the best movie of the year so far and one of Woody Allen's greatest films ever. It is in league with Manhattan and Hannah and Her Sisters. The original screenplay should be a lock for an Oscar nomination and I cannot recommend this film any more highly.Early on, an annoying character makes the observation that a glaring Romantic flaw is Golden Age syndrome. They always look to the past, usually to a specific decade, and define it as the greatest and most interesting time to be alive. It is never the present. For Owen Wilson, Midnight in Paris's nostalgic Woody Allen character, the Golden Age was 1920's Paris. F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, et al., sat around drinking, smoking, and debating literature, art, and music. Wilson's 2010 present involves hack Hollywood screen writing, suspicious prospective in-laws, and mundane hassle. Salvador Dali, T.S. Eliot, and Pablo Picasso must never have had to wash the dishes or take out the trash. However, Golden Age syndrome is in the eye of the beholder. What if 1920's Paris was your present? You would not define it as your Golden Age, but most likely look back to the 1890s and the Belle Époque. That era must have had greater thinkers such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, and Degas. Those gentlemen were probably yearning for the Renaissance. This manner of thinking strikes me as immensely intriguing. Granted, this film requires a certain amount of knowledge beforehand to enjoy it. The Ernest Hemingway scenes are easy to digest, but if you are not familiar with Luis Bunuel, you will most likely miss out on the scene which made me laugh the loudest. At the end, I wanted to pack up, travel to Paris, find a corner café, and order a bottle of red wine to ready myself for an upcoming conversational challenge. I am happy Woody Allen chose to return to a European setting. His two most recent entries in that category, Vicki Christina Barcelona and Match Point are superior to his familiar New York sets. Even You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is better than Whatever Works and Scoop. Take the time to find this film and enjoy it. Afterwards, you will probably run into like-minded folk in used book stores ferreting out A Moveable Feast and the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.",10,2,5,21 June 2011
Underworld Awakening," A weak and forgettable addition to the Underworld franchise
","It is rare for a movie franchise to make it to a fourth film. The Star Wars and Harry Potter franchises had it easy, Star Wars technically started on its fourth installment and Harry Potter had its stories directly handed to them. The Die Hard series had to work for it but held its head above water while the Alien series fell off a cliff when Alien: Resurrection hit the screen. Underworld: Awakening is following in the footsteps of the Alien franchise.There is brief 'remind me of the previous three films' montage at the beginning for those of you who have forgotten the story throughout the years and then Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is back in her familiar gargoyle perch surveying the dark city around her. Unlike Underworld: Evolution, which picked up right where the original left off, Awakening jumps forward a bit to a time when human beings are now hunting both vampires and lycans. These purges are wiping out both species with ruthless effectiveness and extinction may be close at hand. Selene and her hybrid (both vampire and lycan) boyfriend Michael are both wrapped up in it and then comes the big flash forward.Selene wakes up 12 years later from a block of ice after being thawed out in a maximum security laboratory. It seems she has been studied, poked, prodded, and subjected most likely to everything in between by its chief scientist Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) who says he is looking for a cure for both vampire and lycan afflictions. A pre-teen girl known as Subject 2 (India Eisley) is responsible for her release and becomes the catalyst for the chase sequences in this Underworld iteration between vampires, lycans, and humans.Just as the story in Alien: Resurrection was only scarcely attached to its previous episodes, Underworld: Awakening is also much more detached than its predecessors. The vampires and lycans we are familiar with are gone, except for Selene, so now we watch her latch on to a new ad hoc crew including the vampire David (Theo James) and police Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy). Not everything has changed though, Selene conveniently finds her old black leather fetish outfit to the enjoyment of this film's majority male audience.Awakening is also the first installment in 3D whose effects are needless and actually hurt the film. The Underworld atmosphere is already dark and rainy; the 3D makes it that much darker which exceeds the fine line of 'too dark'. Seeing it in IMAX; however, is worth the extra bucks because of the bass. Lycans must come with their own attached sub-woofers with a tremendous low end because every time one is on screen the bass goes into overdrive which is a small consolation to make up for the weak 3D.The Underworld films were never particularly strong, but the first and third films (the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) were enjoyable. Awakening joins its cousin Underworld: Evolution in the reduced discount and throw away Underworld bin. The story is frail, the screenplay is sloppy, the characters are forgettable, and Underworld: Awakening should be avoided at all costs.",3,17,44,20 January 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," Script Failure Hurts an Already Uninteresting Superhero
","Superman came from Krypton. Thor came from Valhalla. Batman was at least quite wealthy. Captain America: The First Avenger – he's a Brooklyn kid born and raised. World War II has broken out and all able bodied men are accepting their patriotic duty and volunteering for the military; everyone except for Mr. Steve Rogers of course. The pre-Captain America is a 90 pound nothing with asthma. He even tries lying on his enlistment papers but with no success.Obviously, the kid eventually gets in lest there be no film. His pure heart of gold gets noticed by a top scientist (Stanley Tucci) and BOOM he is now the superhero with the worst uniform of them all, Captain America. What kept gnawing at me as I was watching the film is that Captain America as a person and as a superhero is rather average, not necessarily boring, but definitely on the uninteresting end of the spectrum. There is no anguish or emotional torment which many other superheroes endure. There is no single force which is his foe ala kryptonite. There is just a very physically fit guy who expertly flings his shield at the bad dudes.Speaking of the bad dudes, Nazis always have and always will make fantastic villains. Nobody is ever pulling for the Nazis to win or sympathizes with them. They really do make the perfect antagonists. Hugo Weaving turns out to be Captain America's alter ego and has a vague resemblance to Hellboy who also happens to get his start in World War II but is a bit of an anti-superhero in comparison. Two other things also work well in this film which is the Colonel played by Tommy Lee Jones and Captain America's romantic interest in Agent Carter (Hayley Atwell). Tommy Lee Jones is a great choice to play a grizzled and annoyed person no matter what the film is about.Unfortunately, the awesome Mr. Jones cannot save a lackluster script which includes an awkward showbiz interlude early on in Captain America's career and somewhat repetitive fight sequences. This whole film appears to be a setup for next year's The Avengers but as a prequel for that, it does not set the bar too high.",5,4,13,11 August 2011
Incendies," Searching a mother's past revives Lebanese tragedy
","Lebanese-Canadian Nawal Marwan (Lubna Azabal) has passed away. She was at the swimming pool, started staring off into space, and then slowly faded away in the hospital. She has left behind her twins, Jeanne and Simon, who are in their early '20s. To them, their mother was a secretary to a local notary, liked to swim, and that is all. Their mother does not have a past, at least not one which she ever brings up in conversation. There is no father in the picture and the twins assume he died back in Lebanon during the war.At the reading of Nawal's will, the twins receive startling news. Their mother has left instructions for them to deliver two letters, one to their father and one to their brother, relations which they know nothing about. The twins take the newfound discovery in completely different ways. Jeanne (Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin) accepts what her mother wants her to do and takes off for Lebanon, a place that is familiar to her only from textbooks. Her brother, Simon (Maxim Gaudette), refuses to have any part of this nonsense and wants to stay out of the affair altogether. For Simon, his mom may have had some alternate, hidden past, but that was not who she was to him. She was a Canadian secretary, not some Lebanese village girl.I will reveal absolutely nothing about what comes next, that is for the audience to discover right along with Jeanne. As Jeanne slowly pieces together the facts of her mother's previous life in Lebanon, the film cuts to Nawal in the past and shows her experiences firsthand. The children start the plot of Incendies; however, Nawal gets most of the screen time. Furthermore, the film does not take time to explain what the war in early 1970s Lebanon was all about. It assumes the audience is familiar with the right-wing Christian militias and the Palestinian refugee camps in the south. If you are not, it may help you to read about the different sides beforehand so you will not waste time during the film trying to sort it out.This is very well written script and the acting is high-quality. What the film lacks is a score. There are two Radiohead songs played in the film which fit in nicely and help shape their introspective scenes. On the other hand, the rest of film is sparse, just dialogue and scenery. This is most likely what the director (Denis Villeneuve) intended, but a memorable score would have gone a long way in helping the events portrayed here land with a deeper impact. The choice of two mellow, thoughtful Radiohead songs though was a very good idea.",7,1,7,29 August 2011
Hugo," Martin Scorsese's love & appreciation of early motion pictures enables one of 2011's best films
","Hugo is a thank you letter from Martin Scorsese to motion pictures, specifically the first motion pictures and their early pioneers. Using the inquisitive adventures of a young, orphaned French boy, Scorsese leads us into a much broader and surprising area than where the setup begins. Furthermore, Hugo is in 3D which at first thought seems an odd medium from the director of The Departed, Gangs of New York, and Raging Bull. The polished result and gimmicky tricks of 3D do not resemble Scorsese's gritty and realistic cinematography preferences. It turns out; however, Scorsese is proficient in both mediums. The 3D effects in Hugo are perhaps the best I have ever seen.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a recent orphan scurrying around the Paris train station in 1931 maintaining its myriad clocks while dodging the watchful eye of the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). Hugo's father (Jude Law) was an accomplished watch/clock tinkerer and before he passed on, transferred much of knowledge and skill to young Hugo. Unlike other fictional orphans though, Hugo is having some trouble taking care of himself. He is quickly outgrowing his childish clothes, he frequently has trouble pilfering food, and his lack of schooling is starting to show. Hugo's loitering ways and incompetent shoplifting efforts not only keep the Station Inspector alert, but they also catch the eye of Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), a toy shop owner in the train station. Through Georges, Hugo meets his granddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), an extremely precocious girl who loves books, always tries to fit in new learned vocabulary into her sentences, and finds the orphan boy running the station clocks to be a very intriguing friend. All of this is just setup though while leading towards the true purpose of Hugo.Papa Georges is not who he appears to be. I will not disclose who he is, but film aficionados will most likely figure it out early on. Hugo's father used to take him to movies which instilled in Hugo a love of the medium as well; he considers them dreams during the daytime. The discovery, eventual realization, and reaction to Georges are the film's highlights and are what will stay with the audience rather than Hugo's exploits. Scorsese's appreciation of early motion pictures is infectious and will hopefully inspire the kids in the audience to seek out old movies and remind their parents of what once was.The characters in Hugo are truly fun to watch as they weave in and out of the train station and its hideaways. A particular highlight is Cohen as the Station Inspector. He receives some quality screen time as he attempts to professionally safeguard the station and maybe even impress the local flower girl. Moretz as Isabelle is also quite good. She shows here she may very well break out of her current child actor status and become a much more accomplished actress. Because Martin Scorsese wanted to share his affection for early motion pictures and found a great script to deliver his message, he has once again made one of the best films of the year. Both children and adults will love this movie regardless that a child is its main character or that it is in 3D. I highly recommend Hugo and encourage you to just sit back and enjoy it.",10,8,14,4 January 2012
Bad Teacher," Bad Santa in a Middle School
","Bad Teacher is Bad Santa in a middle school instead of a mall. This is Cameron Diaz's movie as she is in almost every scene and limits Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel to mostly throw away screen time. Diaz plays 7th grade teacher Elizabeth Halsey whose only goal is to marry rich. She almost succeeds as the movie opens, but a protective mother-in-law thwarts her plans. This forces Elizabeth to return for another school year while she schemes ways to steal money from the school for a boob job. In Elizabeth's mind, it is not her bad attitude or lack of personality which keeps her from landing a sugar daddy, it is her flat chest.The other teachers are played quite well by an effective supporting cast including her main rival across the hall, Lucy Punch, and an always amusing Phyllis Smith from The Office. Justin Timberlake arrives at school as a new teacher, quite possibly with family money to spare, which inevitable creates the feud between Diaz and Punch as they attempt to woo the newbie. Jason Segel is the gym teacher who has taken a shine to Elizabeth even though he knows exactly what kind of teacher she really is. Elizabeth shows a movie every day in class while she sneaks mini-bottle liquor behind her desk and smokes weed in the parking lot. She also eats an abnormally high amount of junk food to maintain the flawless body which she flaunts around in skimpy clothes.The dirty jokes are actually pretty good across the board and Diaz's obscene foul mouth produces plenty of shocking moments. Unfortunately, Bad Teacher doesn't work. The character of Elizabeth is not believable for one second, Timberlake's character is just ridiculous, and Jason Segel might be on screen for a whole four minutes. There are plot holes involving a state test Elizabeth must have known about from the year prior which she is surprisingly unfamiliar with this year and a principal's dolphin obsession which goes nowhere. Granted, there should be a little leeway on believable characters in a comedy, but this bad teacher is so left field that her antics display a level of parody and mocking rather than true comedy.",4,10,22,23 June 2011
To Rome With Love," Woody Allen sets his camera on Rome this time weaving together an anthology of stories and interjecting Rome as its own character
","We have seen Woody Allen's multiple love letters to New York City, London, Barcelona, and Paris; now he sets his satirical eye on the ancient city of Rome. Starting halfway through the previous decade, Woody Allen altered his standard oeuvre from mostly comedic farce with a dash of autobiographical drama set amongst towering New York skyscrapers to films set in major European centers where the city itself is almost its own character. Barcelona nudged its way into the love triangle of Vicky Christina Barcelona and Paris's nightclubs and streets were a central character along with Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein in Midnight in Paris. In To Rome with Love, Woody is even less subtle about his intentions by loudly proclaiming in the film's title what he is up to.There are multiple stories entering and exiting the stage with even more characters; however, unlike the majority of films which juggle numerous plot lines, these do not intersect; they exist by themselves and involve their own unique Roman characteristics. There is John (Alec Baldwin) who chooses to retrace his former life as a young man in Rome 30 years ago and ends up having a very interesting encounter with Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), Sally (Greta Gerwig), and the flippant Monica (Ellen Page). John has seen it all before and sets himself up as a Greek Chorus variant to the younger crowd. By the end of their section, every man in the audience over 30 should be nodding their heads in agreement about the Sally vs. Monica pros and cons. Their love triangle is a convenient excuse to insert the ancient ruins and architecture which you knew must fit somewhere in the film.Hayley (Alison Pill) is in her early 20s and fulfills one of the ultimate lost tourist clichés in Rome; she bumps into Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti), falls in love, and decides to spend the rest of her life in Italy. Upon hearing the news, Hayley's parents, Phyllis (Judy Davis) and Jerry (Allen), jet over to Rome to meet this guy and survey the situation. In his typical Woody Allen way, Jerry has a lot to say about the turbulence on the flight over, sizes up Michelangelo as a Communist, and can barely stand the irony that Michelangelo's father, Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato), is an undertaker. Leave it to Woody to be able to fit his absolute phobia of death and all its accompaniments into a film about Rome. This particular film segment uses Roman opera as its backdrop with a very clever farce involving singing in the shower.The most blatant comedic segment in the film is Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni). He is just a regular working stiff who wakes up at the same time every morning, eats his toast, goes to work, engages in water cooler talk, and comes home. One day, Leopoldo starts getting chased by obsessive paparazzi and screaming autograph seekers wherever he goes who want to know what he likes on his toast, how he shaves, and whether he is a boxers or briefs man. There is no reason for his sudden fame explosion which confuses Leopoldo all the more. This also confused the old ladies sitting next to me; however, this was a brilliant way for Allen to skewer the celebrity fetish. Some people are famous for just being famous even though they have accomplished absolutely nothing.It seems Woody Allen used his most recent European love letter to fit in some messages he has had stirring around his brain for a little bit. He tackles the odd fascination with know- and do-nothing celebrities, the appeal of going after the vapid and attractive female even though you know she is ridiculous and it will only end badly, and what I suppose is a critique of not being a prude at the beginning of marriage. Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) have just arrived in Rome after their wedding to start their new life. Through a silly and contrived sequence of events which only serve to set up a ridiculous situation, Antonio winds up with a stunningly gorgeous prostitute, Anna (Penelope Cruz), and Milly winds up tempted by her most favorite actor in the world. This particular part of the film does not work too well but it does provide plenty of laughs as inappropriately clad Anna visits the Vatican.To Rome with Love is not among the top tier of Woody Allen's decade long infatuation with filming in European locales (Midnight in Paris) but it is certainly not the worst (Scoop). Weaving in and out of these disconnected plot lines is fun and most of them are quite enjoyable. Using Rome and all of its wonderful settings to tie all of his characters together easily helps out what will most likely become one of the more middle of the road and average Wood Allen pictures. However, it is worth noting than an average Woody Allen film is head and shoulders above what is playing down the street in your local multiplex right now.",6,19,38,6 July 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A creative script & stunning acrobatic stunts produce a worthy addition to the Mission: Impossible franchise
","It is rare in the Mission: Impossible franchise for Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) to be assigned an agency tasked mission and enjoy support both from his home office and regular team members who he has worked with in the past. In fact, this has only happened once, in Mission: Impossible II. In the other three films, including the latest, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Ethan and/or the entire IMF are accused of disloyalty, treason, and rogue operations while try attempt to thwart global villains. Taking down the bad guy is always much harder while being pursued by your own government. In the first and third films, Ethan was personally labeled a traitor, now, the entire IMF organization are disavowed because both the American and Russian governments are going to blame them for blowing up the Kremlin. How is that for having the backing of your boss? The man responsible for blowing up the Kremlin and framing the IMF is also the franchise's most far-reaching, intellectual, and dangerous villain yet – a sort of nuclear philosopher who believes that only global nuclear annihilation will evolve the human race. Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) appears just as capable as Ethan Hunt at pulling off intricately detailed capers, breaking into impossible to break in buildings, and being especially useful in lightning fast car chases, fist fights, and any other form of covert espionage. He leads Ethan and his team to some extremely exotic locales including Budapest, Moscow, Dubai, and Mumbai. If there is one asset of chasing a wily villain focused on blowing up the world, he will give you a thorough tour first.The hodgepodge IMF team this time around features the girl (Paula Patton), the geeky tech guy (Simon Pegg), and the unknown variable with a hidden past (Jeremy Renner). They also bring along the most cutting-edge technology which, in theory, should help them infiltrate, evade, and assert control over any situation. What makes this iteration of the franchise so fascinating is that time and time again, technology lets them down. Masks, a staple of these films, fail to come together, climbing equipment fails when it is needed the most, and even car chases in the world's most advanced automobiles are slowed down by pedestrian traffic jams. It is refreshing to see action heroes have to reset and troubleshoot technical glitches just like the regular folk do.I highly recommend you spend the extra surcharge and experience Ghost Protocol in its intended IMAX setting. The large screen is the perfect fit for the outrageous stunts being performed almost every minute and the surround sound truly has an impact on the theater's audience. The Kremlin explosion and the acrobatic scenes performed in and on the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, should be appreciated with state of the art film technology. I realize after seeing it in IMAX that watching it on my home entertainment system would noticeably diminish the impact of the film's stunts and artistry.I have yet to decide where Ghost Protocol ranks in relation to the other Mission: Impossible films, but it is far from the least of them. The script is detailed and well thought out, the action scenes are stunningly captivating, and the tension felt as the villain moves step by step towards his goal is real. The team sidekicks are not to the level of the first Mission: Impossible film, remember Ving Rhames and Jean Reno, and the set-up with false accusations and treasonous allegations are a plot device which is growing ever staler as they use it once again to make the spy team perspire that much more.However, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is worth the time and money to experience what felt like a very pleasurable movie going experience. It is never dull, does not get too carried away with itself, and carries on a fine franchise tradition; Ethan Hunt will perform the craziest and gut-churning stunts to stop the bad guy.",7,2,5,29 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Prequel Worthy of the Original
","The original 1968 Planet of the Apes spawned its own sequel titles and even had its own remake with Tim Burton's 2001 version. Now the original film acquires its own prequel which is also setting itself up for sequels. Confused? Think of the Star Wars franchise as a comparison and that should help. So who started it all in Rise of the Planet of the Apes? James Franco ladies and gentlemen. Franco's father, John Lithgow, is fading away through Alzheimer's. Luckily, Franco is a leading scientist when it comes to ideas and methods to regenerate brain tissue. Before these syringes full of regenerative juice can be injected into humans though, they must first be tested on chimpanzees. Through a series of misunderstandings and then guilt, Franco acquires and brings home baby Caesar and raises him as his son. At first, Caesar does not recognize he is a chimpanzee or at least does not bother to ask why he is different from daddy. Unfortunately, Caesar learns harshly that other humans only see him as a 'dirty Ape'. The zoo chimps also do not recognize Caesar as one of them so here we have our lead character with the ultimate identity crisis; not an ape, not a human. I was skeptical going into this film about sitting through yet another iteration in the Ape franchise. Was this summer blockbuster just made as a one off attempt to win the box office one week or would it have a quality script with complexities? I believe it chose the latter – most of the time. The first half hour and the last half hour of this film are outstanding. Watching Caesar come of age at first and finally become a leader and spur on the film's climax are really entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, the middle hour of the film sometimes feels like a burden to sit through. These are scenes which of course are required to show Caesar figuring out reality and his place in it, but it does not always make for riveting movie watching for the audience. There are also repugnant characters to endure including Brain Cox and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) as chimp caretakers.The payoff is worth it though. No actual chimpanzees were used in this film; every single one you see is CGI and I suppose that is how it could only have worked. These chimps need facial expressions and require a bit of knowing behind the eyes. Also, there are a few sneaky hints throughout which reference the original film which are fun to watch for. I hope the next film in this franchise is up to the challenge to be as good as this one.",7,2,4,11 August 2011
Drive," Outstanding direction creates existential study of a driver
","The driver in Drive is just that, he drives. He has no past and even no name. One would guess prison was a part of his past but that is just a guess. The driver only has two distinguishing characteristics, he is extremely adept behind the wheel of a car and he wears a strikingly odd white jacket with an orange scorpion on the back. The scorpion's meaning is somewhat explained and furthers a philosophical undercurrent in Drive which is not apparent in the previews.The audience I saw Drive with on a late Saturday night opening weekend started to laugh at the screen and mock the actors, the direction, and the jacket. Their expectations did not match what was unfolding on the screen. They expected multiple car chases between the driver and the cops, backstabbing crooks, and action sequences just for the sake of action sequences. Well, those clichés are not here and it transforms what would have been just another Gone in 60 Seconds to a film which operates on a different, more introspective plane.The actors in Drive are well known as true actors who respect their craft: Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Bryan Cranston, and Albert Brooks. Gosling has shown his chops before with The Believer, Half Nelson, and Lars and the Real Girl and might have the fewest lines of dialogue ever by a film's main character. Carey Mulligan, still resonant from An Education, pulls off a sympathetic next door neighbor who needs the driver's help even though she may not know it. Bryan Cranston is assigned a more stock character and Albert Brooks who usually plays bumbling schlubs gets a turn as an antagonist for once. The only sour note is Ron Perlman who just plays an extension of his Sons of Anarchy character.This script requires true actors to flesh it out. Scenes with words are few and far between so that facial expressions say more in conversations than dialogue does, especially between Gosling and Mulligan. There is a reason you will not see Jennifer Aniston and Ryan Reynolds in Drive; there is now way they could just sit in a room, stare at each other, and talk to each other with their eyes and cheek bones.Drive's director, Nicolas Winding Refn, won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival for one reason, necessity. If the film does not need it, it is not there. For example, when the driver is waiting outside while a robbery is going on inside, there is no sound. If you were waiting in a car with the radio off, it would be exceptionally quiet, just like in the film. There is no background noise, no radio on, nothing. The audience was absolutely quiet right along with the film straining to hear what was going on in the building next door. Refn could have extended the car chase scenes with more screeching tires, made the scenes between Gosling and Mulligan more romantic, and turned down the accompanying existential philosophy. By choosing not to do these things is why he won Best Director.Existential is the most apt word to describe the driver. He gives his own life meaning and purpose. His background is never brought up once, but something in his past has shaped his actions. He lives his life sincerely despite the myriad distractions of obviously crooked associates, menacing goons, and the unfamiliar terrain of romantic feelings towards a woman. What truly makes Drive so good is all of the pitfalls it avoids by just focusing the camera on Gosling on Mulligan and letting it go from there. Mainstream audiences looking for standard car chases and fist fights on a Saturday night will not understand Drive; the philosophical undercurrents here make them uncomfortable. Drive is for those who appreciate diving in a bit deeper rather than wading in the cliché kiddy pool.",8,12,26,18 September 2011
The Bourne Legacy," Bourne Identity remake with a sci/fi twist; the Bourne franchise deserves better
","Jason Bourne is one of the more intriguing film characters of the past decade. He methodically and purposefully found out who he was, who was responsible for his condition, and attempted to bring everything back together again. Even better, he was not a superhero; Jason was just a guy who went through a lot of training. He is elite, but deep down he is still one of us. Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), on the other hand, has been tweaked a little bit. He pops pills to up his physical and mental skills. Yes, he is still human too, but perhaps a bit genetically modified. This splash of sci/fi does not help an audience tuned in to the adventures of Jason Bourne connect with the new guy.When I first heard there was another Bourne installment, this time without Matt Damon, I figured someone either wrote a good script to carry on a new story line, or the studio wanted to churn out a guaranteed cash cow under the title of a proved and successful action series. Writer/director Tony Gilroy wrote the scripts for the first three Bourne films, but this is his first time behind the camera in the series. He successfully directed Michael Clayton and the under- appreciated Duplicity, but now the magic is gone. The Bourne Legacy is stale. Enduring a painfully slow beginning, The Bourne Legacy reveals it is set at the same point in time as The Bourne Ultimatum. In fact, if you have forgotten the plot points and supporting characters of the previous film, take the time to either watch it again or read about it online before heading into the new feature. Jason Bourne's escapades have thrown multiple CIA operations out in the open and the shadowy powers are frantically trying to sweep them under the rug before either Congress or the press start asking questions. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) orders the termination of Project Outcome, the new series of super agent represented by Aaron Cross. Instead of telling the agents to pack up and go home, the CIA chooses to assassinate them instead. Oh, and they try to wipe out all of the scientists who made them so super in the first place.Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) is one of those scientists seeking ways to alter chromosomes to make a more perfect human. After surviving annihilation himself, Aaron conveniently scoops the good Dr. out of harms way which sets up an 'us against them' theme quite similar to the one you remember from The Bourne Identity. Unfortunately, The Bourne Legacy noticeably lacks the quality script and thrilling action sequences of that first film. The chase scenes in the new film are edited so atrociously, especially during motorcycle elements, that they are almost impossible to logically follow. You know they are weaving in and out of traffic, there are near misses, and flying bullets; but there are only quick glimpses of that on the screen in the midst of the unsteady camera work and split-second jump cuts.The Bourne Identity also had a mystery to unravel and wandered around the world trying to find out who was behind the curtain. There is no curtain now, Edward Norton is pulling the strings in plain sight using all of the means in the intelligence community he can lay his hands on. There are armed Predator drones, devious mop-up CIA killing squads, and even a possible super- duper agent; imagine the Schwarzenegger Terminator battling the new T-1000. Renner and Weisz do their best to remake a film which was already pretty great. Yes, they have new names and faces, but they are running from the same agency, dodging the same bullets, but this time they have a higher chromosomal level on their side. The Bourne Legacy will be known as that film which derailed the very respectable Bourne franchise. Paul Greengrass, the director of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, was correct when he said any further film would feel like The Bourne Redundancy.",3,160,280,10 August 2012
The Artist," A mesmerizing masterpiece; please go enjoy this homage to silent film
","George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) has a dream halfway through The Artist with real sound. He sets a glass down on the table and it makes a noise. The phone rings, the dog barks, and it all sounds so harsh and shrill. Both George and the audience wait for George to wake up and end these horrible noises. Please, take us back to the wonderful world of silent film in black and white whose only sound is the soothing cinematic orchestral score. Yes, The Artist is silent. The actors are moving their mouths but only every now and then does a dialogue screen pop up for the audience to read. The effect of this throwback is a mesmerizing masterpiece. Just as Hugo was homage to the earliest films and George Melies, The Artist celebrates the late 1920s silent film era and appears so accurate it most likely could have been released in 1927. The giveaway is that everybody in the movie theater on screen is smoking. Nobody in Hugo's Parisian train station was smoking which is good for the kiddies, but kills authenticity.George is the silver screen's golden boy. His motion pictures make a ton of money, the audience loves his swashbuckling heroes, and his incredibly well-trained Jack Russell Terrier usually stars right along side of him. Through a series of unlikely events, an aspiring actress, a perfectly named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), appears on his studio lot as an extra and they develop a noticeable level of chemistry together, though there is no sign of adultery because this is 1927. George is a married man and while he may be distant from his wife, there will be no vow breaking here.If you are familiar with Singin' in the Rain, then you know what is coming – the talkies. George takes one look at an early prototype of an actress speaking on screen and laughs at is as a gimmick. Nothing could replace silent film and besides, the audience, 'his audience', would never stand for it. How wrong he is. Soon enough, studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) fires George choosing to begin the era of sound in film with fresh faces, such as Peppy Miller.The depression strikes, George blows through his savings on one last ditch attempt to save silent film, and he is done for. He is not alone though, his reliable dog is with him as well as his now unpaid chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell). Peppy is never far either. She remembers who was responsible for her meteoric rise and is perhaps playing some Fairy Godmother role in George's life even though she is much younger. The plot seems a bit thin and silly as I write this, but it comes across as much deeper than it sounds. George and Peppy are wonderful on screen together and The Artist is just so much fun to sit back and watch. The doubters will naturally stay away from it no matter what anybody writes; the combination of black and white and silence is just too scary to think about sitting through even though this is leagues above the common denominator.",10,1,4,11 January 2012
Super 8," Abrams Honors Spielberg
","Super 8 appears to be J.J. Abrams' way of paying his respects to Steven Spielberg. I was steadily reminded of E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind throughout this film. The community kids are the first to discover the strange things happening around town, are almost always the only witnesses to important events, and repeatedly run into the adults who just don't understand.An article in this week's New York Times magazine describes how a young J.J. Abrams got a job repairing and editing Steven Spielberg's old Super 8 films. That is a great memory to start your new screenplay with. Five pre-teen kids in an out of the way, small Ohio town are making a zombie movie on a Super 8. The boss kid is the director and persistently updating screenwriter. There is also the nervous lead actor, the kid obsessed with explosives who plays the zombie, and our film's main character, the make-up artist who is also adept at model trains and airplanes. While sneaking out at night to work on their movie with a newly recruited girl in their mix, the kids witness a train derailment and so begins the mystery.I will reveal nothing about the train, what was on it, and what happens after that. Would you have wanted the answer to everything about E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind before seeing them? No way. Just know that this is not a movie just for the kids. There are genuinely suspenseful moments, a lot of pre-teen cursing, drug use, some quality horror gore, and an overall tight story. It is very refreshing to see a summer movie which is not a franchise continuing sequel or about a new superhero. These kids are real and there small town adventure mystery is well worth it.",8,12,25,8 June 2011
Taken 2," The story is a bit laundered and rinsed from the original, everything is merely imitation
","Released in 2008, Taken came out of nowhere to earn $145 million at the box office on just a $25 million budget. The movie-going public recognizes fresh material when they see it. Taken was original, creative, driven, and hosted one of the most memorable protagonists in recent memory. Of course they would have to make a sequel to wring some more money out of Taken's fans.A review of a movie sequel which starts outs praising the first installment instead of the new story is most likely not going to be very kind to the unfortunate title which ends in the number 2. Taken 2 keeps Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills, Famke Janssen as his ex-wife Lenore, and the always relentlessly annoying Maggie Grace as his daughter Kim. Rule of thumb - if Maggie Grace is cast in your film, it will probably stink. This is her second feature film in 2012, after Lockout, so she is 0-2 this year. The bad guys are also mostly the same; they are the extended family of the first group of Albanians Bryan killed after they kidnapped his daughter and sold her into sex slavery. Now they want revenge; they must honor their dead sons and brothers. It doesn't matter that their sons and brothers were human traffickers, rapists, and murderers. Family honor is family honor ya know? Bryan is growing close with his family again. After a few days of work in Istanbul as a heavily armed bodyguard, Byran invites Lenore and Kim to Turkey to take in the sights and relax in a very posh hotel. Fortunately for the Albanians, this is where they are going to kidnap Bryan, transport him back to Albania, and torture him to death. The introduction of mom and daughter is a cherry on top for the head bad guy Murad (Rade Serbedzija). He is older with grey hair; I mention this because all of the other couple dozen bad guys run together, he is the only one you will remember. In Taken, Bryan had it comparatively easy. He had one person to save and could methodically move through the ranks of thugs as he stabbed and shot his way to the top. Now, not only does he have to watch his own back, he must save both mom and daughter, sometimes alternating which one he can help at any given moment.The original Taken was so good because of Bryan's practical and purposeful methods of extracting information, Neeson's deadpan delivery, and the ins and out of seedy Paris locales. Now take everything which made Taken a great movie and divide it by two. You already know the story, you know Bryan will talk slowly and concisely about how he has certain skills, and this time you get to suffer a bit more because Maggie Grace gets more screen time. The camera work also takes a nosedive during hand to hand combat. The camera shakes, jumps up and down, does some jumping jacks, and the average edit is probably .002 seconds. The audience has no hope of logically following who is punching whom or where a new bad guy springs up from. Scenes where Bryan fights with a loaded pistol are much easier to watch.It's not that I'm mad at writer Luc Besson or director Olivier Megaton; they probably were under a lot of pressure to re-create the Taken magic. Unfortunately, they did not do a very good job. The story is only a bit laundered from the first one and everything else is merely imitation. Stay away from Taken 2, it will only remind you of its superior predecessor.",4,6,13,5 October 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A fitting trilogy ending with effective new side characters and one mean villain
","Superheroes are usually infallible, except for whatever their one weakness is. What I mean is that after a knock down, drag-out end of the world fight, they are able to get up, wipe the dirt off their shoulder, and walk away without any visible scars. Batman is not superhuman though, he relies on technology and a therapist's dream amount of anger. It has been eight years since the events of The Dark Knight and no Gothamite has seen even a glimpse of Batman (Christian Bale). Coincidentally, nobody has seen reclusive billionaire Bruce Wayne either.Bruce limps now; he shuffles around with a cane, stoops his shoulders, and has no cartilage in his knees. During a fundraiser, he is actually at a disadvantage and lets a cat burglar, Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway), sneak into his rooms and steal his dead mother's pearls right in front of him. Yep, Bruce Wayne is depressed. Business isn't doing too well either. Along with Luscious Fox (Morgan Freeman) who runs the day-to-day of Wayne Enterprises, Bruce sunk half his money into nuclear fusion research trying to develop clean energy for Gotham City. That avenue does not appear to be taking off any time soon. Alas, if it was just his money, Bruce probably would not be so down in the dumps, but he also took the money of philanthropist and do-gooder Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard). Bruce really does not like to lose a good looking lady's money. The Dark Knight Rises would be an altogether odd Batman film if the main villains were depression and the recession. No worries, the bad guy this time literally emerges from a dark hole in the ground, wears a grotesque mask on his head, and sounds like a hard to understand Darth Vader. Bane (Tom Hardy) is a big guy. One could say he grew up in a rough neighborhood and has been socialized to become the world's, and naturally Gotham's, leading terrorist. He nonchalantly takes over and disintegrates a CIA aircraft, takes the entire New York Stock Exchange hostage, and oh yeah, gets his hand on a neutron bomb which he hangs over the heads of the woefully unlucky Gotham citizens. Please Batman, come back to us; but there is no Batman to be found. Gotham City blames the Batman for Harvey Dent's death and despite the best efforts of Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) to temper their anger, nobody likes Batman too much.That is just fine with Alfred (Michael Caine). He is more than happy to see Batman hang up his repelling hooks and leather body suit. Besides, he thinks Bruce Wayne can do the world more good than Batman can; especially an older and weathered Batman. But if it wasn't for those gosh darn meddling kids, Batman probably would have stayed out of this whole mess. Rookie police officer John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) knows the truth about Bruce Wayne. How? Well, you will have to watch the film for that; needless to say, I thought it was quite the stretch how he figures it out. Blake works for this film's resident jackass, Foley (Matthew Modine), who is angling to take over for an even more weathered Commissioner Gordon.The Dark Knight Rises is a big film. I do not necessarily mean that in terms of its budget, its expected box office take, or the IMAX screen I saw it on. Just like The Dark Knight, its underlying philosophy is big. The script dives deeper than the ordinary first layer of is he a superhero or a vigilante? Perhaps Alfred is on to something that what the world needs is another philanthropic billionaire and not a guy hopping around town on his latest crazy gadget. The gadget this time is a kind of batwing, but is just odd looking and clunky. Bane also has his own philosophy, but it is more 'We are the 99%' taken to the nth degree combined with a dash of mayhem and some spicy nuclear Armageddon. I only understood about 80% of Bane's dialogue. There are times when he is truly hard to understand. He voice is amplified by a microphone and I think there is an Irish accent in there. This film is a fine capstone to Director Christopher Nolan's trilogy. It stays away from the campy, make fun of itself side ala Batman Forever and continues the effective choice from the previous film of an incredibly formidable enemy. Just like Heath Ledger's version of the Joker, Bane is not someone you take lightly. Batman can mess around with the Riddler and Mr. Freeze, but Bane would eat those two for breakfast.",7,1,4,28 July 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Enjoy falling into another Wes Anderson fairy tale world this time with runaways, a 45 rpm record player, and a character named Social Services
","If the director's name was omitted from the opening credits, you would still know exactly who created Moonrise Kingdom. Wes Anderson's style is so familiar to his fans they would be able to pick out his sixth film anywhere. The character close-ups with them staring directly into the camera are here. The short, simple and declarative sentences are here. Of course, Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman are here; however, those two are the extent of the usual Wes Anderson film players involved in his latest. There is also the whimsical plot, an omniscient narrator, and a character named Social Services.Moonrise focuses on two 12 year olds, Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward). They consider themselves misunderstood and find kindred spirits in one another on a small and isolated New England island in 1965. Sam is in a Khaki Scout troop run under the detailed eye of Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). Suzy is an island native being raised by her lawyer parents, Walt (Murray) and Laura (Frances McDormand), who call each other counselor during conversations. Sam and Suzy follow through on their idea to run away together and are quickly pursued by Suzy's parents, Scout Master Ward, and Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), who appears to be the lone policeman on the island.Sam and Suzy make a good pair. He has absorbed excellent camping and nature skills from the Khaki Scouts and Suzy, after getting tired of feeling like the black sheep of her family, relishes the fact that she is not alone in the world. Sam has been alone a long time. He is an orphan who does not fit in anywhere and is now also pursued by Social Services (Tilda Swinton). These two 12 year olds spend a lot of time in front of the camera together and thankfully pull it off. Moonrise Kingdom would have been in big trouble if Wes Anderson had not found capable kids to fill these shoes.The adults take on supporting roles either as parents who just don't understand or confused authority figures who cannot figure out why their charges would ever want to run away. Captain Sharp is tired and lonely, the Bishop parents are growing apart (which is not helped by Laura's frequent bullhorn announcements), and Scout Master Ward thought he was running a tight ship of scouts before the run away. He is starkly confused on why anyone would ever want to leave the scouts, even if they are the most unpopular one in the group.The actual run away escapades, the ensuing search parties, and the developing relationship between Sam and Suzy are best left for the audience to watch and discover rather than read about it in a review. Notable supporting characters pop up now and then which will cause audience members in the know to smile. The most enjoyable part of the film though is Wes Anderson's familiar atmosphere. There are not too many films whose world you wouldn't mind drifting off into. Plenty of people would raise their hands to jump into a Wes Anderson world, be it in such previous efforts as Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and now Moonrise Kingdom.Robert Yeoman has been the director of photography on all six Wes Anderson films and the audience can see it immediately. The long, panning shots, the in your face close-ups, and the ever so slight fairy tale feeling are all trademarks of his style and camera work. The script is up to Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums standards and thankfully surpasses the lesser efforts of The Life Aquatic and The Darjeeling Limited. Co-written with Roman Coppola, the dialogue is what you expect from Wes Anderson and the scenes with the 12 years olds are spectacularly written. These are not just children, perhaps under-sized adults is a more suitable term.Thank goodness for Wes Anderson. Without him, the cinema would be a far less interesting place to go to. His peer group includes the Coen Brothers, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Cameron Crowe. Together, that list makes a formidable effort to educate movie-goers about what true films are capable of and continue to push back against the mundane garbage you usually are served from the likes of Michael Bay and Adam Sandler.",8,3,5,5 July 2012
Looper," Time travel can be confusing, but let Gordon-Levitt & Willis worry about that; you get to sit back & enjoy a great movie
","Time travel is confusing. Once you think you may have a grasp on it and have ironed out the 'what-ifs', a new paradox will pop up and collapse your argument which was a house of cards anyways. There are too many holes, and especially plot holes, when you try to rationally reason through what it means to travel through time and change the past. Once time travel is invented, hasn't it always been invented then? If you go back in time and change something, will you just disappear because your specific future no longer exists?Looper sidesteps this whole enigma by having old Joe (Bruce Willis) tell his younger self that there is no use trying to figure it all out; it will just confuse you. This one statement immediately smooths out the conversation he is having with young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the audience's mental gymnastics, and while still leaving them right there in front of you, chooses to ignore the Grand Canyon sized plot holes. If you spend enough time with a pen and a sheet of paper, you will most likely identify a dozen or so glaring issues with jumping back through time, but where is the fun in that? With Looper, it is enough to recognize you have a creative story to watch and gifted actors to watch carry it out.The year is 2044, not so far in the future to imagine teleportation and interstellar flight, but far enough to dream up new technology, weapons, and illicit drugs. 2044 is quite similar to today's reality, but its every day norms and today's extreme edges magnified by 1000. There are hover motorcycles, currency is literally based on gold and silver, and the drug all the kids are using is administered through eyedrops and appears to have the effects as cocaine. There is also some glaring income inequality, you either have money or you do not; there is no middle class. The city landscape shows thousands of people living on the sidewalks and sometimes in the middle of the street. If someone steals from you, it looks like you are allowed to pull out your personal shotgun and teach them a severe lesson. Young Joe is a looper. At a specific time and always in the same place, the edge of a corn field, a hooded person will appear out of nowhere and all Joe has to do is immediately pull the trigger on his weapon and get rid of the body. These unfortunate souls are being sent back through time from 30 years in the future where time travel is illegal; therefore, it has morphed into a black market time travel system run by the mob. Young Joe is paid handsomely to do these simple tasks and spends the rest of his day and most of the night going to a club to drink, dance, take drugs, and spend time with Suzie (Piper Perabo), his favorite lady of the evening. There are rules to follow though. Since the system is run by the mob, breaking the rules is frowned upon. I will not go into the rules because young Joe does a good job explaining to you what they are. In his film noir, gravelly voice, which is trying to match a young Bruce Willis in style, Joe opens the movie and brings you up to speed on what has been happening with the time travel business and his specific spot on the food chain. He has looper friends with Seth (Paul Dano) as his closest one and he gets called in to see the boss, Abe (Jeff Daniels), from time to time. Other than that, young Joe is really running his own loop with his day job and his nightly activities.Old Joe effectively ends that routine as soon as he pops into the corn field out of thin air. One would think that young Joe would have some questions or would want to cut his older self some slack, but no such luck. Young Joe enjoys his current situation and is in no frame of mind to have it messed with, even if it is a version of him doing the interrupting. Old Joe is on a quest to change the past and does not seem too pleased to run into his former self either. These two are the same man, but they certainly are different people. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really the leading man here because Willis is in more of a supporting role and has noticeably less screen time; however, Bruce still gets top billing on the poster and in the credits. I wonder if that chafes Gordon-Levitt? Both Gordon-Levitt and Willis are very good here. On one hand, they are playing the same person and must try and match each other's facial ticks and mannerisms, but on the other hand, Gordon-Levitt is playing a kid against Willis's older and yes, wiser, character. Another supporting character is Sara (Emily Blunt) but I leave it to you to discover her role. Sara is saddled with most of the slower scenes in the middle which drag on a bit, but it's good to take a break from Joe, both young and old, after awhile. Looper was written and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick, The Brothers Bloom) who should be commended for sitting down and puzzling through what must have been a very arduous screenplay. You will not understand the physics of how everything works in Looper (probably because the physics actually don't work), but you don't have to. Let young and old Joe worry about that. You just get the pleasure of sitting back and enjoying an original, thought-provoking, and well made sci-fi, action thriller.",8,0,11,30 September 2012
50_50," Following the life of a young guy with cancer (Gordon-Levitt), 50/50 is profound and pure enjoyment
","Many films about cancer are actually only about 'movie cancer'. These have characters who say they are sick but their disease does not seem to interrupt their lives at all as they continue on normally until one day they unexpectedly disappear because of their phantom cancer. The rest of the films concerning cancer realistically show their characters with aches and pains, traumatic responses to chemotherapy, and emotional breakdowns. 50/50 shows real cancer and not the fake movie kind ala this month's Gus Van Sant film Restless.Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27 year old sound editor for Seattle Public Radio. His relationship with his girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) is looking up as she is starting to spend more and more nights over at his house. Adam's best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) is also a major part of his life mainly as chauffeur, work mate, and deliverer of crude comedic one-liners. Adam has everything going for him and finally decides to head to the doctor to check out some nagging back pain. When the doctor blindsides him with a whole bunch of really long sounding words relating to a tumor on his spine, Adam's world stops on a dime and all of his plans and expectations just pack up and fly out the window.He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, and he recycles. How on Earth, especially at 27, could he have a tumor? Chemotherapy begins right away as does a myriad of other doctor visits and awkward sessions with a 24 year old therapist who looks even younger than that. Katherine (Anna Kendrick) is assigned as Adam's therapist to help him sort through his feelings; however, he has a very tough time adjusting to the fact that he is her third patient ever and their rapport takes an immediate hit when she has no idea who this Doogie Howser person Adam keeps mentioning is. Adam also notices how his friends and family relationships change regarding his disease. Which of his friends will step up and stick by him in his troubled times? Will his girlfriend stay supportive, will his best friend want to keep hanging around and will his mother (Anjelica Huston) be able to keep it together enough not become another emotional problem in his life? 50/50 was written by Will Reiser and is loosely based on his real experiences with cancer. Reiser is a frequent co-writer and friend of Seth Rogen which is why he shows up in the sidekick role here. Coincidentally or not, this is also a reprise of a character Rogen played in Funny People when he became Adam Sandler's sidekick when he had cancer. Rogen's character Kyle is very similar to his wise-cracking, vulgar characters from Knocked Up and Pineapple Express. In fact, it probably is the same character just with another name because he plays them exactly the same.The two actors who really rise above the rest in 50/50 are Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick. Continuing a remarkable series of characters from 500 Days of Summer and Inception, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very believable as a young guy who must come to grips with a new reality he did not sign up for. Also, the talented Anna Kendrick shows up in a very familiar role because the audience saw her do the same thing in Up in the Air; she plays a character where she is judged as too young to be effective. Unlike Seth Rogen, Kendrick is extremely capable and her scenes with Gordon-Levitt are as uncomfortable and stunted as they would be in a real hospital.Bryce Dallas Howard has now played back to back roles as an extremely unsympathetic and callous character; this summer's The Help has Howard as a conniving villain. She should be careful lest she is typecast as the wicked witch next. Thankfully, Anjelica Huston is here in her juiciest role since 2007's The Darjeeling Limited or even 2004's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. She does not get too many plum roles anymore which is a shame because she steals the scenes she is in as the emotional wreck of a mother. She overshadows Gordon-Levitt and annihilates Seth Rogen when they share the screen.I mentioned Restless earlier because both of these films were released close together, have a main character with cancer, and are even both based in the Pacific Northwest. 50/50 is supposedly shot in Seattle and has one or two establishing shots with the Space Needle in the background but the vast majority of it is obviously shot in British Columbia. 50/50 looks and feels that much better because I saw Restless recently and it was so ridiculous in how it showed a character with cancer that 50/50 shines bright above it.Even though I complain about Seth Rogen's acting, 50/50 is a very powerful film and does not match the comedy its preview promises. There are scenes to laugh at, but there are many more which are truly deep and prompt meaningful responses from the audience. 50/50 is a delight to watch and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. You will be happy you took the time to seek this one out.",9,3,6,1 October 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Just because it is a third installment doesn't mean it must be a farce
","The third (and hopefully final) installment in the Transformers franchise is just as weak as its immediate predecessor and far weaker than the opening salvo in the trilogy. The scenario setup had promise though. The Apollo program and the space race were an elaborate front to get to the moon and check out a UFO which crash landed there. This crashed ship turns out to be a casualty from Cybertron and naturally holds some cargo which both the Autobots and Decepticons desire. These events are combined with more historical fiction including Chernobyl and with quality writing could really have taken off somewhere intriguing. Unfortunately, Michael Bay chose to focus on an extremely uncharismatic Shia LeBeouf and his insecurities of unemployment, jealousy concerning his girlfriend, and wishing he had more recognition from his previous attempts to save humanity. To extend an even bigger weakness, John Turturro is also back again and now seems like even more of a Daffy Duck sidekick instead of an actual human being. Michael Bay tries harder this time to make the hand-to-hand combat amongst machines work but anyone sitting in the audience will continue to find it quite challenging to tell the difference between Autobot and Decepticon until they somehow untangle themselves. Also, the humans scurrying around beneath their robotic feet while dodging falling bits of building somehow never get accidentally squished which should really give a lot of credit to the machines situational awareness.The Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, reprised his ministerial role and speaks only in philosophical platitudes which contribute nothing to anyone and is most likely why he receives far less screen time to perch on his soap box and spout them at whoever is unlucky enough to be in the room when he begins a sermon. His speeches resemble a page-a-day motivational calendar. The female lead this time, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is not Megan Fox but is interchangeable enough that it does not matter. Casting also added ensured the new accent brought a British accent with her to make her even sexier to the American male audience. The first hour of the film has her getting in and out of quite a few low-riding vehicles in extremely short dresses which have most of the audience straining to catch a glimpse. I wonder if Megan Fox left this series before or after she read this script; she dodged a bullet here. The new additions of Patrick Dempsey, Francis McDormand, and John Malkovich hold their own with limiting material but Ken Jeong's character is just flat out ridiculous. John Turturro is already in the film to provide the lame comic relief; adding Jeong helped make the first hour even worse than it was already shaping up to be.",2,5,12,9 August 2011
