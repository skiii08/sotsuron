The Equalizer," Won't be looking at the home depot the same after this movie
","Every bit as tough as John McClane in a die hard movie. No sarcastic quips though. Cool calculating, swift and smart is the way I would describe this character. Deep inside many of us wish for justice that someone would protect us if we needed it, that someone would stand up and do the right thing, the dangerous thing. The reason we love super hero's so much, we want the world to be more just, we want the world to be more fair, for their to be those with nerves of steel unabashedly facing the ills of the world. This is why this movie works. We want more people like this in the world. Someone who is a one man wrecking machine but against the bad guys. We want to ourselves be this brave to be this lethal to be this smart to be this brave. We want the bad guys to have their ass's handed to them. This character is stoic and kind, solitary and lonely. Scarred but true. He cares about others and puts his caring into action. He even gives the bad guys an out and when they don't take it, it takes them out.",9,2,10,28 September 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Loved the movie
","I am lucky enough not to be a purist, who speaks elvish and can recite verbatim parts of the books. I did however read the Hobbit as a child and I must say I wasn't impressed, it was okay, maybe it was because I was a girl? Not sure. These movies however I love from beginning to the end. I am thrilled Peter Jackson is at the helm of these 3 Hobbit films. I was one who was thrilled that Jackson and the Lord of the Rings Films won the Oscar, in my opinion it deserved it. They are stunning stories, stories that keep me glued to the screen. When I am thinking of nothing but what is going on the screen you have captured me, its engrossing. I will again be very sad when this trilogy is over, I loved the first one and love this 2nd one. Wish Viggo Mortensen would of chosen to be in the film. Love the addition of Evangeline Lilly, and like an old friend loved seeing Legolas again! and the mention of Grimley, wonderful!",9,0,9,15 January 2014
