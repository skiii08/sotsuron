The New World," One of the worst films ever!
","Wow! I am reading some of these comments and am amazed! This has to be one of the most boring films ever! No one seemed to speak! What in the world was up with no one actually speaking! I would have liked to see more interaction with the Rebecca and anyone. OK, OK, I realize it's a love story, but wow, how much time needs to be spent running thru the fields looking at each other. If I knew who to ask, I would request a refund for the 2 tickets as well as the snacks and the over 2 hours of my life I will never get back! This narrow minded film could have been at least 30 minutes shorter. Believe it or not, my husband hated it even more than I did.",1,4,12,7 February 2006
