Catch Me If You Can," Good Film, Good Story
","There's nothing wrong with this film. Acting is as strong as one might expect from people like Hanks, DeCaprio, Walken. The overall film is a good story told by a good storyteller, Spielberg. Not all films can be an E.T., Philadelphia, Lord of the Rings..and when they aren't it's important that they be a solid demonstration of the talents of those involved. Such is the case with this film. Cudo's, however, to Walken who demonstrated restraint from his usual over-the-top Walkenisms and portrayed his character within the story. I think if Spielberg keeps this up, he'll be a good Director (kidding of course).",5,0,6,14 January 2003
The Producers," A Classic!
",This is a classic film with wonderful performances all around (although I didn't take to Dick Shawn's as much as the others). Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were perfect casting as was Christopher Hewitt (later to be known as TV's 'Mr. Belvedere'). What's even more impressive are the various elements of truth that are beneath the histerical if not obsurbed storyline. The current Broadway hit doesn't compete with this film. The performances are good on stage but not as wonderful as here. Due to long term business problems this film wasn't released for home video and cable until much later then it should have been. Outright broad comedy and silliness belong in our daily lives and this film offers them very well. EVERYONE should see this film!,Null,19,24,6 August 2002
