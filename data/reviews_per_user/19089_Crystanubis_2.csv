Requiem for a Dream," You Have Probably Already Seen It
","6 out of 10You know a film is in trouble when some fancy camera-tricks, animpeccably fantastic performance by Jennifer Connelly (amongothers), and a carnivorous refrigerator are the only things saving itfrom being dismissed as complete mediocrity. Aronofsky is awonderful director and his talents really show in the film. Theproblem is that he chose a rather formulaic and lackluster story.If one were to ask, 'what kind of movie is it?' or 'what's it about?'one would receive this painfully short response: 'It's a drug movie.'If you have seen Train Spotting, Naked Lunch, Pierrot le Fou,and/or Pulp Fiction, you have seen this movie; they all haveidentical set-ups (except maybe for Pulp Fiction):1) We are presented with characters with seemingly promisingfutures and the hopes and dreams to live them out accordingly.2) They have it in their minds that the only way to achieve thesehopes and dreams is by getting themselves a piece of thenarcotics-peddling pie, which they do. 3) Everything seems to go accordingly until the characters''professional' lives interfere with their personal lives.4) There is a subsequently fateful downfall of the characters inwhich, if they do not end up back where they started, they end up afew steps back (if not leaps and bounds).The distinctions among all of these films is found within themanner and style in which step 4 is carried out. Granted, this filmcarries out step 4 very well, but time-lapse photography, staccatoediting, and MTV's Fear-style POVs can only entertain for so longbefore even they become tiresome. Sum Up: Great acting, great direction, great editing, greatcinematography, formulaic and predictable story. Fun to watch, butleaves you with little to take with you when the credits roll. My Advice: Stick to Pi.Also: In addition to a performance by Ms. Connelly, we are alsotreated to a somewhat disturbing performance by Keith David,playing the character of Big Tim, a swinger/pervert of the highestcaliber. It is a true testament to his flexibility as an actor when oneconsiders that, a few years earlier, he had played a muslim holyman in Pitch Black.",6,0,2,20 January 2003
