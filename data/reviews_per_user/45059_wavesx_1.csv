It," Disappointed!
","Really really I had high expectation, First the acting was not so good and story was not exciting, only kids can see the clown and the things happening *rolling eyes* the ending was predictable, like can't they made the ending at least good? They tried so hard to make the movie disgusting but no, it was stupid, I'm normally the type to get scared easily when watching horror movies, but this movie didn't scare me at ALL, such a waste of money.I'm really disappointed!!!",1,31,71,7 September 2017
