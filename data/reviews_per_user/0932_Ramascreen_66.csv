Insidious: Chapter 2," Scary Fun
","We horror fans have been spoiled this past year, we've had it good  because director James Wan brought us The Conjuring and now Insidious:  Chapter 2, if this film had been any scarier, the world may stop  spinning, it is that scary. It's terrifying but it's also fun because  of that Ghostbuster-esque duo with their mormon missionary type outfit  on, who return to once again provide the humor for this franchise. But  seriously, James Wan has mastered this genre and made it his own. To  me, Wan is like this generation's Dario Argento. Wan and screenwriter  Leigh Whannell prove to be a winning team and they've brought us a  sequel that's just as good or even better than the first film.  Now, I'm going to try to do this review without spoiling details, and  it's going to be hard but I'm going to try to the best of my ability.  INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 takes us back to The Lamberts who went through  basically hell over their son's essence being trapped in this realm  called The Further. Now, what's extremely cool about how Wan and Leigh  crafted this sequel in that they play it in a way that this realm The  Further becomes a connection, a bridge between the first and this  second movie. There would be little instances like a door suddenly  opens by itself in the first film, and this sequel shows you why the  door did that. There are countless sequels out there that try hard to  expand on something while begging audiences to check out the first film  again, but the way that is done in INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 is clever.  Folks who've seen the first movie would be amused, folks who haven't  seen it would practically beg to watch the first movie after they're  done viewing this sequel, and all of it much thanks to this realm that  Wan and Leigh created, anything can happen in it, you can travel  through time, you can travel through places, ghosts can get you there,  and you can even get trapped in it, it's like a zone or a dimension  that probably Rod Serling himself would wish he had thought of it.  James Wan is a great horror director because he knows exactly what  scares you. That idea that somebody may be there watching when you  can't really see anybody there at all. It's that uneasy feeling that  slowly but surely creeps up on you and then strikes you in a heartbeat  without mercy, it's that old ghostly tale told by some kind of expert  who has gone through the experience years prior, Wan knows exactly  which elements that would not only scare you but would also leave you  scared long after the movie's done. INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 offers all  that and a bag of chips, one can even call this movie, INSIDIOUS: The  Origin Of The Bride In Black. While they're dealing with what may or  may not have happened to Patrick Wilson's character, they discover a  certain backstory that explains the motivation for the Bride In Black.  While a certain past or a certain childhood is a dealt with and as they  try to close the chapter on The Lamberts, they open a new way to a  possibility of the team of experts going to another family, because  this is a world where The Further has taken the front seat, it has  become the lead star and the face of this franchise. I think INSIDIOUS:  CHAPTER 2 won't disappoint the fans, and I guarantee you'll have a  jolly good fright at the theaters.",Null,61,94,12 September 2013
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bill Condon's Twilight
","It really is challenging to write up a review for any Twilight movie, especially this fourth installment when you're neither a fan of the books nor the previous movies. Because when you're a fan, you can easily geek out and be stoked about it no matter what. But when you're not a fan, you're faced with the fact that you're going to write about pretty much the same damn thing again because you've noticed a pattern. One thing I'd say is that the build up, before this movie arrives, around how it would depict the sex scene and the birthing process does come in handy in attracting those of us who think that it's a dreadful experience dragging our feet to the screening for another round of Edward-Bella-Jacob..Dreamgirls director Bill Condon handles BREAKING DAWN PART 1 which I was informed is told through Bella's point of view. They should've added.. Bella's point of view, pain, suffering, and agony, because Bella gets even extra nervous than before, obviously because of the wedding, what that wedding would do to Jacob, moments leading up to losing her virginity and the decision on whether or not to keep her baby, the story sure does put her in very uncomfortable situations one after another to the point of seemingly torturing her. Edward is the concerned husband, the worried dad to be. But what stands out to me is the present development of the character Jacob who goes into some really dark places and by that I mean he seems to be dealing with his own tough choices and the anger or the frustration that he carries may allow him to become a man depending on the choices he makes.And so I think where those character are in the story this time around encourages the actors Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and especially Taylor Lautner to push their skills just a bit further. Whereas in the previous movies, they could easily remain in the comfort zone of a lovey dovey very generic love triangle, now they find themselves in a love triangle situation equipped with heavier complications and consequences. But if you think having an Oscar winning screenwriter Bill Condon in charge means having him rework Melissa Rosenberg's formulaic script, think again! Because the last thing on Condon's mind is to upset the fans. So the staring contests and the cheeesy unbearable, often unintentionally laughable dialogue are still there, it still feels like watching a teen soap opera with cinematic values, so everything that you'd expect from a Twilight movie, BREAKING DAWN has all of them, but I think what Condon managed to do is maintain the tone and set up a conflict that would lead to some kind of common ground, he also managed to approach certain risqu√© segments appropriately, keeping them within the boundaries of Bella's point of view, even the birthing process itself is done in a manner that allows you the audience to somewhat see what's going on through her eyes. Having Condon as the helmer allows the characters to offer more, thus allowing the actors to express a wider range of emotions, believe it or not.The fans who've come to be swept away by this franchise's romantic weapons, so to speak, will not be disappointed. The lavish outdoor wedding and the rather funny toast speeches would get any Twi-hard to giggle and chuckle, not to mention the honeymoon in exotic Brazil with the ridiculously private exquisite vacation home, which serves as a role model for what honeymoons should be like. The production goes all out, spares no expense. Of course fans of action movies like yours truly would also expect a good fight between the vampires and the wolves, and that's exactly what I get from Cullens vs. Jacob's clan. If I were to take one thing that I'd consistently find truly impressive about this whole franchise is the VFX of some of the characters turning into wolves, that to me will always be the part that's pretty hardcore. Now they even digitally mess with Bella's weight which I think is one of this film's nifty treats.",Null,6,13,18 November 2011
It," Take the boat, Georgie!
","The brand new #ITMovie scared the heck out of me and I don't throw that around loosely because just when you thought that 'Annabelle: Creation' may have set the bar for this year, bam! 'IT' comes along and smashes that bar into pieces. Wow! This is one incredible horror film, everybody involved should get a congratulatory pat on the back, definitely a huge upgrade from the '90s miniseries. This is best Stephen king adaptation yet.Directed by Andy Muschietti, based on Stephen King's timeless novel of the same name, IT is set around the mysterious disappearance of children in Derry Maine, when a group of young kids will have to come face their biggest fears and square off against an eternal evil clown named Pennywise who comes around every 27 years to repeat his reign of terror. It's no secret and it's not really a spoiler that New Line and the filmmakers of this new version have planned to re-imagine this story into two installments, with the first focusing on the children and then chapter two will be about their grown up selves once again battling Pennywise. So with this first chapter, I think the timing of its arrival couldn't be more perfect especially with last year's debut of the hugely popular series, 'Stranger Things' that brings up '80s childhood nostalgia while presenting mystery at the same time, 'IT' offers you that same vein and I think that's OK because we haven't gotten to the point where it's played out so for the time being you're going to love that aspect about 'IT.' There's definitely a 'Stand By Me' vibe to it as well, and the whole thing does feel episodic, at one point while screening it I didn't want it to end, it felt like I was binge-watching, it was so cool. Kudos to all the young actors featured in this film, they really hold their own and each of their characters' distinct personalities stand out. Their backstories and their process of slowly but surely coming together as some sort of a team is both honest and engaging. Now, if you've ever read Stephen King's book, 'IT,' you'd recall that it is a super duper thick book. You can use it as a stool to stand on for when you need to change that lightbulb. But the point is, I think the screenwriters of this new film did well in condensing the story to just the right amount of time that contains just the right mix of kids camaraderie and the horror fest that is Pennywise. And if you've watched the '90s miniseries, you'd recall how much that version held back plus the low quality practical effects that they had at the time. Well, I'm happy to tell you that this new 'IT' doesn't hold back, this is Pennywise unleashed, it's practically proud of being R-rated, which is great because it allows for the scary parts to be really really scary and not second-guessing or pandering. And if you have never liked clowns before, you're going to hate clowns even more because Bill Skarsgard's performance as the new Pennywise will haunt your dreams for the next few weeks after you've watched this movie. What I appreciate about Skarsgard is that he doesn't try too hard to emulate or imitate or channel Tim Curry, Skarsgard does his own take of creepy. And because Pennywise is pretty much invincible to a certain extent, you'll see him pop up in the most unlikeliest of places meaning when you least expect him, that's when he'll scare you to your core so brace yourselves for surprises around every corner. Another reason why the timing of this movie's arrival could not be more perfect is because today's visual effects compliment Pennywise's limitless abilities and so director Andy Muschietti and his crew have the creative freedom to not only realize some of the scare points in the book but they managed to also go beyond that. 'IT' goes for massive, it goes for bold, it goes for bloody, not a single boring minute, it goes for the 'Goonies' fan in all of us. You will laugh, you will scream, you will have nightmares, hands down one of the best horror movies ever made. -- Rama's Screen --",10,260,524,5 September 2017
Detroit," One of the most important films you'll ever see
","Even if Kathryn Bigelow's #Detroit movie may not purposely intend on pointing out the continued failures of our justice system with regards to police crime in today's world, it succeeds in doing exactly that. This is a raw and disturbing depiction of an even more disturbing true story that for one reason or another had been stuck as some kind of historical footnote for the past fifty years but it is timely as ever and it's one of the most important films you'll ever see.The director who gave us 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty' proves once again, with 'Detroit,' that she is not one to run away from controversial subject matter. Written by her frequent collaborator, Mark Boal, 'Detroit' is set during the most terrifying civil unrest that rocked the iconic motor city in the summer of 1967. The story zooms in on the Algiers Motel incident involving the death of three black men and the brutal beatings of nine other people including two white women.Bigelow and her crew apply the famous cinema verit√© style of filmmaking that allows you to feel like you're there in that hallway with those victims as they're hands and heads are up against the wall, as the cops are beating on them. It doesn't get more visceral and up-close than this, the cinematography that is in constant motion elevates the intensity because it engages you the viewers and never lets go. Everything about this film is meant to create a sense of discomfort in addition to its trying to also reach some kind of authenticity that comes across as thoughtful and respectful. It's very hard to watch, definitely not a film for everybody.Bigelow knows the importance of setting up the context and so the film comes with a prologue that briefly explains the history behind the migration and also the transfer of wealth away from the neighborhood and how pressure cooker builds up, how the events culminate into an uprising and ultimately this collision between a few racist cops and a few unfortunate young folks. So that way you get a better understanding as to why the collision got to be as violent as it did.In the roles of the villains, actors Will Poulter, Ben O'Toole and Jack Reynor give performances unlike any other corrupt cops we've seen before. Poulter in particular, perfectly embodies what a person would do when he's on an absolute power trip. Poulter is a remarkable young talent with skills beyond his years. Equally impressive are Jacob Latimore and Algee Smith who play characters traumatized, physically and mentally affected by the incident. Rising star John Boyega plays an African American security guard who's unwilling to speak out but doing his best to keep anyone from getting shot. Some might see it as complicit or cowardice, he might see it as surviving.By the way, even though the film's focus may be on this motel incident or on this Detroit riot, screenwriter Mark Goal manages to make it also be about these individuals, and so you fear for them every passing minute. The production design and the combining of archival footage and photos from that night make it seems like you've been transported to 1967, this is a film that pays attention to details and goes the distance and does whatever it can to convey what I think it tries to impart to the audience and that to me is the relevant theme indicating that if you think our criminal justice system is broken and messed up, if you think inequality is bad today, imagine the cruelty and the unfairness they had to live through some fifty years ago. We as a society have still got a long way to go.-- Rama's Screen --",10,23,75,28 July 2017
Wind River," Suspenseful! A perfect thriller!
","The screenwriter who gave us 'Sicario' and 'Hell or High Water' has come back with 'Wind River' which he also directed and I am now convinced more than ever that Taylor Sheridan is one of the best storytellers of our time. There's something about his thrillers that are just so cunning and sharp and profound, like a great American classic, even novelist Dennis Lehane probably couldn't come up with materials that are as skillfully played as this. And with 'Wind River' Sheridan's personal artistry mission to do some effort to right the wrongs that the system has committed against the Native Americans, continues.The story is about a rookie FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) who teams up with a tracker/hunter (Jeremy Renner) with a tragic past in order to investigate the murder of a local girl on a remote Native American Reservation.Sheridan has tackled themes surrounding the Native Americans before but with this latest one, it's not so much that he's preaching about it but he ties it into this entire fabric of community where you sense the clash between outsiders and locals, between whites and natives, so there's a level of frustration about that arises from this murder investigation that brings up all kinds of cultural suspicions, on top of which there's also a game of jurisdictions. It's a complex yet cleverly woven thriller that starts out as a whodunit and evolves into a thirst for retribution. And the fact that it's set in a very cold harsh environment just adds to the film's chilling effect.In many ways, Elizabeth Olsen performs here like Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling where at some points you kinda know that Olsen's character may be out of her elements, but at the same time that factor actually gives her a good vantage point. Jeremy Renner plays his character like an old timer western hero who knows the ins and outs of everything, a man of few words but gets tough when needed. Their dynamic is not some kind of odd couple cop duo, this is more like each of them trying to prove themselves while bringing justice to the family of the unfortunate girl. And the way Sheridan crafts the mystery from a small radius to a much larger scheme is one that will have you hooked. 'Wind River' is highly suspenseful, it's a perfect thriller.-- Rama's Screen --",10,269,333,1 August 2017
Inglourious Basterds," We're in the Nazi-killing business
","--Rama's SCREEN--To say that this is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece would be to undermine Pulp Fiction and I don't think this movie is on the same level but it is definitely nothing short of an impressive work by a great filmmaker who still believes in¬Ö the power of snappy, strong, infectious dialog. It is is both fun and intimidating. Christoph Waltz deserves an Oscar nomination for his supporting role as Hans Landa.They weren't kidding when they say it's WWII seen through the eyes of Tarantino because this is how WWII would end if he had anything to say about it. The only thing unsatisfying is that it leaves too many unanswered questions. If you've come to find out about the 8 soldiers recruited or if you're not familiar with Tarantino style and you're expecting to see more head-bashing business or graphic bloody violence ala Kill Bill you might get disappointed because even though this movie has those elements, and I kid you not it has those elements, they're not what it solely depends on to capture the audiences' attention. It's got drama, comedy, action, suspense, coolness all around, even Mike Myers is amusing but if you lose track of the important conversations in between, none of that would matter.Let me make this clear, I enjoy this latest Tarantino work but it's not perfect. I think it could do more to make itself less confusing and easier to follow. Tarantino likes to mess around with time line, you never know when or where or which part of the story he'd take you in each scene and that's cool, I got no problem with that, I'm a big fan of his movies but the thing is this movie comes in chapters, from one to the end chapter, now, if only those chapters didn't come in chronological order because the storyline sure doesn't seem to suggest that.What you need to keep in mind as you're watching this movie so you won't get too upset about not knowing what's going on is that Lt. Aldo Raine and his soldiers are just complimentary to the actual lead plot which centers on Melanie Laurent's character, Shoshanna Dreyfus, and her plan to burn down her own theater along with all the Nazis including The Jew Hunter. Aldo Raine's men and Shoshanna collide but do not interact. Let's just say that Aldo Raine's plan wouldn't work if Shoshanna didn't have hers first.Every one of us who've always wished we could go back in time and kill Hitler and his posse with our bare hands would like this new take on WWII because this is no Schindler's List. It's about vengeance and who doesn't like a story of an eye for an eye. But Tarantino doesn't just let you have quickie fun; he takes his time, building up to that brutal yet awesome moment in the end. I'm mostly fascinated with Tarantino's idea of branding the foreheads of Nazis who don't want to be Nazis anymore; this is done so they could live with a reminder of their sins for the rest of their lives. Brilliant idea! If we want to talk editing, set decoration, cinematography, and all the technical aspects, you'll be glad to know that Tarantino has brought back his old crew from the Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction days so guys like Sally Menke and Robert Richardson already know how to realize Tarantino's vision and satisfy his fans who come to theater hoping to watch nothing less than a Tarantino movie.Just wanna leave some room to emphasize again Christopher Waltz' excellent performance as Col. Hans Landa. The opening scene is one of the best I've seen in the history of cinema, not because of the some extravagant VFX, but because of Waltz' ability to engage you in this long yet interesting, illustration-filled speech, accompanied with a glass of milk and a huge pipe cigar. Every time his presence appears on screen, you can sense the evil radiating from his character. You just never know what he might do in a split second, you don't know how mad he can get, and that not-knowing becomes his weapon, he slowly but surely scares you into giving the information he's looking for, even through a deceiving smile. If the Oscars don't award Waltz the Best Supporting Role statuette, then there's something wrong with the system.I'm not sure if this might qualify as a contender for Oscar's Best Original Screenplay only because it leaves too many unanswered questions especially those about some of the characters' backgrounds. But after watching the whole thing, I understand now why Tarantino has been working on a prequel because a prequel would certainly explain a lot and fill in the missing chapters. Come to think about it, the story could even go on indefinitely. How the team got to France, what happened to the rest of the gang who don't make it to the gala premiere, what's the deal with the whipping and the list goes on. It's obvious that Tarantino only chooses a number of characters to focus on for this one and deal with the rest in another possible installment. Oblige them, Tarantino!--Rama's SCREEN--",8,3,12,10 August 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Resilient
","Wow! They weren't kiddin' at all when they said #RogueOneAStarWarsStory is in the same vein as 'The Dirty Dozen' or 'The Guns Of Navarone.' This has got to be the most grounded, most heroic 'Star Wars' movie I've ever seen. Because when you take out many of the usual elements that make the Star Wars saga iconic, whats left are the faith and strength of the human spirit.Behold the first 'Star Wars' standalone film, 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,' a new epic adventure in a time of conflict as a group of unlikely ordinary heroes band together on a mission to do the extraordinary: steal the plans to the Empire's most ultimate weapon of destruction, the Death Star. Starring Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk, Riz Ahmed, Jiang Wen, and Forest Whitaker. Scripted by Chris Weitz and then Tony Gilroy, directed by Gareth Edwards.A band of misfits teaming up for a common cause, it's nothing unusual in a 'Star Wars' saga, after all it doesn't get more of a stubborn misfit than the smuggler Han Solo. But firstly, I'd like to commend 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' for its international cast, I'm sure some of those decisions are based on business in order for the film to do well in certain markets by featuring the biggest stars from that region, but nevertheless, it really adds authenticity to the already diverse group of characters.Since the story is set between the events of 'Revenge Of The Sith' and 'A New Hope' a.k.a the original 'Star Wars,' this film has tons of references that are sure to get every fanboy and fangirl geekin' out because they will pick those up immediately. But do those references distract? Not necessarily, they're nothing more than a wink. The script to me isn't perfect. I guess we'll never know for sure which parts are filmmaker Tony Gilroy's contributions until Gilroy himself breaks his silence, but to me, the film feels like it drags a little, and the conflict within the Rogue One team isn't as impactful as one might expect from such stories. And the resolve seems unearned. But does that hurt the movie in any way? It's arguable. I'd say all of that gets redeemed by its pulse-pounding battle sequences in the final act, something akin to the beach invasion in 'Saving Private Ryan.'Actress Felicity Jones is rugged and resilient, hers is unlike any other heroines that this saga had given us over the years. Less elegant and more general-like. Jones pretty much plays it straight the entire film. There's a familial dilemma at the heart of it all, which is expected, since as we all know it's not a 'Star Wars' movie without lineal themes. But my favorite in 'Rogue One' has got to be Donnie Yen. Growing up in Asia watching all his movies, to finally see him be part of something as big as this, and he actually does quite well in it, I must say that's a good enough reason to feel happy for the man. And his character is as badass as it gets. The new droid, K-2SO doesn't always hit the target when it comes to being the comic relief but when it does, you'll get a few laughs out of it. I think fans will be in an agreement that Ben Mendelsohn as the villain Orson Krennic is incredible. He has that strong, commanding, intimidating presence overshadowed only by Lord Vader whose cameo reminds us exactly why we are in awe of his might.Because this is a prequel to 'A New Hope' which as you know has its own decades-ago graphics, you have to give credit to 'Rogue One' for at least attempting to capture much of that look, tone and style, or at least give you the impression of it. That said, as a standalone, does it really need to exist? And if we were to list our favorite, where will we place it among the ranks of other 'Star Wars' movies? That is something we the fans would just have to judge for ourselves.",8,2,6,13 December 2016
Passengers," The perfect date movie
","PASSENGERS is your textbook romantic film surrounded by breathtaking sci-fi. After so many survival films about one man only or one woman only, on an island or in space or against a shark, it's nice to see a survival film with two people and nobody else for a change. And with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as the leads, this is a glossy adventure you can't keep your eyes off of.The story is set onboard a spaceship transporting thousands of lives to a new life on another planet, it's supposed to be a 120-year journey but a malfunction happens that causes Chris Pratt's character, Jim's hibernation pod opening prematurely. Having spent a year all by himself there, Jim decides to intentionally get a woman to wake up as well, that woman is Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence). As they begin to unravel the mystery behind the malfunction, they fall in love, but when certain truths come to surface, they find their spaceship and their lives fall apart.This is a sweet, sleek, romantic film, boy meets girl in a pod, boy wakes girl up, boy falls for girl, o and there's a bartender in a setting that looks kinda like the bar in the overlook hotel in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining.' And just the million and one things that the spaceship can do is enough to make any sci-fi fan go, 'Whoah, that's super cool.'When I was screening 'Passengers,' I was trying hard to find whether or not the film has some kind of underlying point that I may have been missing but really it's just a story about relationship, can it survive the cosmic ordeals at hand and can it also survive the lies. It is really essentially a romantic drama set in space, it doesn't get much simpler than that. Our future ambitions can't compare to our fear of loneliness.To this day, I'm glad that writer/director James Gunn gambled on Chris Pratt as Star-Lord in his 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' movie because otherwise we probably wouldn't have known that hidden gem, that leading man everyman quality that Pratt has, and it shows in this latest character, Jim. And Jennifer Lawrence is just as beautiful and sharp as ever, her quick spot on reactions, how she's there for the moment, is unparalleled. Yes it's got thrills, mystery, and spectacular imagery but when you strip it away, what you have is 'Passengers' as this season's perfect date movie.",8,24,51,21 December 2016
The Hunger Games," May the odds be ever in your favor, Happy Hunger Games!
","Unfortunately I'd have to stand in the middle on this one. I loved the book, I could read it a thousand times, the adaptation on the other hand, though not entirely terrible, does not excite me as much, but even if I hadn't read the book, I think THE HUNGER GAMES film could be so much more deeply affecting. Granted it's been months since I last read the book so I won't be making too many comparisons in this review, and I promise I won't compare it to Battle Royale. I enjoy director Gary Ross' style and the film's scope and how loud and outrageous the costumes look, the future is undeniably wacky and it doesn't mean a bad thing. The film, in my opinion, sadly tones down the violence and amps up the drama which doesn't always work, especially when the hint of romance is uncertain, it may be for show only or it may be genuine. I think PG-13 is the wrong move for this film, because to me, THE HUNGER GAMES' violence, kids killing kids, is the heart of the evidence of how cruel the government and the game truly are, it's the very essence that fuels and motivates Katniss and Peeta to survive and so taming it or leaving it to thoughts, just makes you feel like you're robbed of what should be an emotionally grounded, heart-wrenching film√Ç‚Ä¶ Let's start with Jennifer Lawrence, I was a huge fan of her work in Winter's Bone, she was absolutely phenomenal in that film, which obviously makes her qualify for THE HUNGER GAMES because much of the living condition of the people in District 12 is more or less similar but THE HUNGER GAMES moves quickly, I don't think it gives the audience enough time to get acquainted with how harsh life is in District 12 and what it is that Katniss would have to leave behind and how difficult it is to part from that life. Ross throws some of those in, by way of flashbacks, but it doesn't help trying to piece them together. So it comes across a bit underdeveloped but keep in mind that it's always tough when you deal with adaptations. I think Jennifer Lawrence does a fantastic job as Katniss, though there are times when it's hard to sense her emotions, there's a scene in which Katniss shoots an arrow at the direction of the gamemaker and his company because she's upset and angry but you can't really sense if that is exactly what Lawrence is expressing. But other than that, Lawrence is by no means the weakest link of the film, that said I still think Hailee Steinfeld of True Grit would'v been a more solid choice for the role.I find it amusing that Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth (Gale) who are natural blond, are now brunette and the brunette Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) has to go blond. Just an interesting note there. The costumes and the makeup are the show stealers here, I was waiting to see how they'd pull the flame/fire spectacle at the arena for the opening ceremony, well, it's not a spoiler if I tell you that nowadays you can just easily go digital, so I wasn't wowed. I think Hemsworth and Hutcherson are unable match Lawrence's talent, despite their best effort. You'd see Lawrence as Katniss giving her all and then the camera moves to either Hutcherson or Hemsworth and neither of them could meet her halfway. Donald Sutherland is a brilliant choice as President Snow, Sutherland is one of those actors that you could just hand him a role and he'll run with it, and he'll leave you with assurance that he's going to do a damn fine job with it. The other 3 interesting characters of course are Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, and Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket. Woody can play a drunk better than a drunk, so there's no problem there and when he speaks, even when he's drunk, you'd stay still and listen. I just wish they'd made Lenny look more eccentric, it's sad because they go all out for other characters and the extras but Lenny as Cinna looks too normal and ordinary. Banks knocks it out of the park as the pink-haired Effie, the way she carries herself, she's just sassy, I'd pay for another ticket just to watch her. Before I forget, Stanley Tucci as the MC Caesar Flickman is fantastic, with his big smile and ridiculously white teeth, and freakishly tall hairdo. Ryan Seacrest, eat Flickman's shorts!For the most part, the film tries to stay faithful to the book but those of us who know better would notice how significant the changes are. I really like the design for the computer grid across the sky and also the way the gamemaker's control room is set, think if The Truman Show's director was in the future. I could go on and on and on observing and analyzing every single detail but overall, THE HUNGER GAMES has so much potential to draw you in, if it would just not hold back as much. If it would be much braver or bolder, I'm a big fan of cinematographer Tom Stern but even his work on this film seems more on the safe side, the film doesn't take enough risk. But I think the audience would follow the girl on fire anywhere she goes, at least to the sequels.",6,1,19,20 March 2012
Green Room," Patrick Stewart is scary in GREEN ROOM
","GREEN ROOM is intense and terrifying. It's like 'American History X' and 'Deliverance' gave birth to a messed up up baby. Patrick Stewart is absolutely scary. Whatever previous ideas of Patrick Stewart you may have either from his 'Star Trek' or 'X-Men' years immediately goes out the window once you see his performance in this film, I really didn't think he had it in him, what an excellent performance.Written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier, the story is pretty simple, it's about a struggling punk rock band in the Pacific Northwest, they do a small concert in a small white power bar, and what's supposed to be a quick gig turns into a nightmare when they stumble upon a murder. At the wrong place at the wrong time is where they are and so now they're forced to bust their way out of the bar that's been surrounded by the lethal skinheads who want to eliminate any trace of evidence and witnesses.The minute the terror kicks in, GREEN ROOM's level of tension shoots up and remains there throughout the entire film, the violence keeps on humming, you just never know what sort of maniacal actions or retaliations that may occur, this is one of those films that consistently shocks you, leaving you to wonder who among the characters would survive because your guess is as good as the next person's. I think what Jeremy Saulnier has crafted here is a survival story within confined spaces, despite what you may or may not think about neo-Nazis, your stance on that becomes irrelevant when it all boils down to just a matter of escaping. It's part horror, part thriller, with excellent cinematography, GREEN ROOM is a relentless, unpredictable bloodbath of a film.-- Rama's Screen --",8,9,23,14 April 2016
The Rocker," Never ask permission to Rock!
","I've always wanted the movie School of Rock 2 but I never expected it to appear in this form. THE ROCKER isn't original but it is entertaining. It's another story of a middle aged man who wants to feel young again, who's been wanting a second chance because¬Ö he didn't get it the first time around but then he learns something valuable along the way. THE ROCKER has enough humor to make you laugh and leave you smiling at the end of the movie. Look at your rear view mirrors, comedy movie stars everywhere because Rainn Wilson is drawing near and he's catching up.It is a funny movie. Don't get your hopes up and don't have low expectations either, because one way or another, you're going to end up liking this movie. The jokes aren't that raunchy but some are in the borderline. Some scenes are cute and sweet and will make some audiences go 'Aww'. The self-realization moments are not cheesy or too sentimental. I'm glad the movie is still determined to stay cool and rock n' roll throughout the whole thing.Here you can definitely see the drastic difference from what the 80s thought was awesome and what the present time thinks is awesome as far as music, hairstyle, and clothing go. It's about knowing when to grow up but at the same time knowing not to let go some things that make your spirit feel alive. It's about what it means to be in a band and have each other's back. And it's about appreciating oneself without letting what others say mess with your heads and what it means to Rock! All that and more already covered in Jack Black's School of Rock but instead of kids,¬Ö this time it's geared toward teens.I like how this movie promotes Rock n Roll Hall of Fame museum in Cleveland, Ohio. It sure receives some publicity from this movie. Despite the fact that I've been to Ohio twice in my whole life, I have yet to visit the site. It will be my my purpose for living.I just wanna emphasize that THE ROCKER wouldn't have been what it is without Rainn Wilson's excellent performance. His charm and persona is what gives this movie its soul. His comedic timing is as on the target as his ability to endure slapstick physical humor and to change moods and expressions from a careless immature adult into a compassionate, and responsible team player. Maybe Will Ferrell could also do the gig but I don't think he would as good a job.",Null,2,5,20 July 2008
Public Enemies," Firepower!
","--Rama's SCREEN--PUBLIC ENEMIES is what Firepower is all about. You'll never see a more exciting gunfight and shoot out this year. Director Michael Mann has crafted the ultimate cat-and-mouse game,¬Ö his best work yet. Non stop thriller action that takes only a few minutes to breathe in between before it takes you down again for a joy ride. Christian Bale and Johnny Depp are charismatic and unstoppable, the new Robert De Niro and Al Pacino of Heat. You're gonna wanna see PUBLIC ENEMIES again and again. It makes you wanna get a tommy gun. Hands down, one of the best movies of the year.I'm a big fan of Michael Mann's work, except Miami Vice. That one didn't quite live up to expectations. But Mann's return with PUBLIC ENEMIES doesn't disappoint. When I got to meet him briefly at a screening, I knew I was in the presence of somebody's just downright awesome. You can tell from PUBLIC ENEMIES that he's brought back his signature marks, signs where you can easily tell it's a Mann's movie. He doesn't try to come up with CG backdrop to give us a sight of an old 1930s city, he puts the camera on a tight leash and just focus on the characters and the art deco buildings. And just like his other action/thriller movies in the past, it always ends in the evening or there'll be a massive showdown between two opposing parties in the middle of the dead night. Mann knows what the audiences would be rooting for in this type of movie, he makes sure that when Dillinger and his men make their getaway after a robbing a bank, they'd do it in style. Cinematographer Dante Spinottie who's worked with Mann before knows what the master filmmaker wants and what we get are shots that give that reality impression and definitely heavy emphasis on the well-choreographed violence. I enjoy how the movie likes to keep using Otis Taylor's catchy song 'Ten Million Slaves', somehow it fits perfectly in the presentation.Johnny Depp is the epitome of cool, he knows it and uses it to the fullest for this role. His character John Dillinger's got enough charm and confidence to spare but only has eyes for one lady. If you thought the way Jack Sparrow carried himself was infectious, wait til you see how Johnny Depp plays John Dillinger, he's a bad guy who loves being infamous. The unlikely Robin Hood in a time of Great Depression when people could care less about the banks he robs. Christian Bale who plays special Agent Melvin Purvis assigned to hunt down Dillinger, is as excellent as Depp. It's like having 2 heavyweight fighters in a ring and the match is long overdue. They both keep each other on their toes. Bale has been known as an actor who can listen well and mimic any accent. He puts down a great effort to sound like he wasn't born in Wales. Great star-studded cast overall, Michael Mann's lucky enough to have excellent actors signing up from left and right to play both members of the gang and members of the FBI including Billy Crudup who captures young Edgar Hoover's insecure, arrogant and stubborn personality down pat. Marion Cotillard gives a great supporting performance as the girlfriend who's willing to risk everything for a man she barely knows. She's not an easy woman for Dillinger to conquer.What really will get you hooked, once again, is the cat and mouse game. Purvis catches Dillinger but Dillinger gets away, Purvis closing in on Dillinger but Dillinger is one step ahead of all of them. You see many different ways it's done throughout the entire movie and you'll get entertained every single time. Just when you thought the bad guy's captured and the good guy gets all the gory, the game begins again.I'm glad Mann decided to take the story up a notch by not just making it about Dillinger Vs. Purvis, it's about what would happen when a man is pushed to the point of desperation. You never work with or never ever trust a desperate man, that's the theme that you see in the character development. Both Dillinger and Purvis are good at what they do, but then circumstances happen that would turn them into desperate men. Alienated by his business partners, Dillinger starts to lose what makes him hard to catch in the first place. Without realizing it he starts to create predictable patterns and habits that would eventually get him easily fooled, he becomes unaware of unwanted surprises . Pressured by Edgar Hoover, Melvin Purvis finds himself allowing certain methods to get Dillinger, the ends justify the means is the result. Some say that Michael Mann's endings rarely hit the level of satisfactory, I say PUBLIC ENEMIES' ending won't let you down, without being too extravagant, it concludes itself just the right way. --Rama's SCREEN--",9,38,79,29 May 2009
Little Boy," A good cry
","Ya know, I pride myself as a macho strong, independent man, I don't have a pick up truck nor have I engaged in caber tossing like they do in that Scottish athletic games, but I don't easily cry while watching a film, no matter how sentimental it can get. The last time I shed tears was when watching 'Armageddon' the scene in which Bruce Willis said goodbye to his daughter played by Liv Tyler. But my holy freakin' goodness, LITTLE BOY had me literally crying like four times at the screening, four times, man! And ya know what, I didn't regret it at all. This is a very powerful, inspiring, can-do film, led by child star, Jakob Salvati whose talent is bigger than his appearance.From co-writer/director Alejandro Monteverde, LITTLE BOY is about an 8-year old boy, Jakob's character, Pepper who believes that he has what it takes to bring his father home from WWII alive. He and his father are really close, so when his father (Michael Rapaport) leaves for war in place of his oldest son, it sets off events in that family, in that community, in that small town that will get them all learning about tolerance, faith, and love. Jakob is given a task by the local priest (Tom Wilkinson) and this list of assignments are supposed to help bring his father back, one of them is for Pepper to befriend the only Japanese resident, Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), it's an uphill task for Pepper seeing that his older brother and the whole town are blaming Hashimoto for the war.Christian community might see this film as something that they can encourage their members to go to theaters and see with their families and I think they should, but LITTLE BOY is not a Christian film. It also wrestles with the idea of believing in one self, one's will power. But what's great about this film is that it doesn't take sides, it only goes to show that many people hold different beliefs, doesn't always mean that some are more right than others. This child actor, Jakob, blew me away. He's so effortless, you feel his pain and agony, Jakob makes it so easy for us to feel sad for Pepper, makes us want him to be a better kid each day. If you're looking for a good cry, LITTLE BOY is the prefect movie for you, it's a tear jerker but not in a sense that it alienates certain audiences, because anybody who's dealt with loss or separation, anybody who doubts the idea of a mountain-moving faith, can relate to LITTLE BOY.Please read more at Ramascreen.Com",8,26,35,24 April 2015
Point Break," Pointless Break
","If I wanted to watch videos about people doing extreme sports, I can just do that via YouTube. #PointBreak remake is essentially about Brian O'Connor infiltrating Dominic Toretto's gang and we start to question where his loyalty lies.. o, my bad, that's actually the plot for 'The Fast And The Furious' It's been years since I saw the 1991 Kathryn Bigelow-directed original 'Point Break' starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze and this remake pretty much has similar logline in that Luke Bracey plays an FBI agent infiltrating a team of criminals. But instead of Bank Robbers and only surfers, this time it's more than just heists and it also features all kinds of other extreme sports activities from motocross to wingsuit skydiving to snowboarding to climbing angel falls, and the team is headed by Edgar Ramirez's character who's determined to reach spiritual enlightenment. And at one point, Luke Bracey's character also fires his gun to the air out of frustration, Keanu probably would look at that version and go, 'Really?!' Again, it's been a long while since I watched the 1991 film, so I won't make the comparison here, but what you need to keep in mind is that this POINT BREAK is style over substance. It's all just about looks and daredevil stunts, there's nothing about the story that anchors you in, the performances of the actors are mediocre, it's one of the most badly-written films I've seen all year, and watching this film would be the most time-wasting way to spend your holidays. Not to mention the film leads to a pointless meaningless ending. So much for that search for enlightenment. The only winners out of all this are the stuntmen and the green screen background.",1,5,11,26 December 2015
"I Love You, Man"," Apatow Would Be Proud
","I LOVE YOU MAN is a bromantic comedy that's funny, outrageous and just statin' the truth. It underlines the fears guys have about commitment whether it's to opposite sex or usual friends. It's a refreshing comedy that in a way makes fun of¬Ö your typical chick flick out there. It has that montage, same awkwardness that comes with dating or making that phone call but instead of a guy and a chick.. it's a guy and a guy. Jason Segel and Paul Rudd are this year's Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.I LOVE YOU, MAN is not an Apatow-produced movie but I'm sure he'd be very proud because not only does it feature two guys who've graduated Apatow school of comedy but the humor itself is meant for those of us who love Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall where R-rated comedy can have great storyline.Writer/director John Hamburg and fellow screenwriter Larry Levin clearly understands some of the rules and concepts that are being played out there in the game of relationships. Rules that in the end don't mean a thing unless honesty gets first place. And that's where the hilarity of this movie comes into play. It's refreshing and enlightening at the same time, it won't leave you in awe but you'll understand where the story is going.Granted, this is not a complete laugh-out-loud experience but you won't get bored, not even for a minute and just like any other well- structured story, this one also has those components where you see one aspect at the beginning that you'll know would just come up again one way or another nearing the end. It's somewhat predictable, yes but nothing that would make you wanna leave the cinema in embarrassment. I think the top thing that would make this movie memorable years from now is the many weird catchphrases that Paul Rudd's character makes up to end his sentences so that he could sound all cool. He'd be saying greetings or farewells and them awkwardly because the word he chooses to say them are just plain confusing.. and that's funny. Jason Segel plays one of those unlikely best friends who'd just wanna have fun and doesn't wanna be tied down with too much responsibilities and has a certain way of helping his friends out. Segel plays his character with coolness that's not over the top, he's the kind of guy that you'd hang out with because no matter how much of a party boy he'll become, he'll never get too annoying. Rashida Jones is just OK as the girlfriend, I wouldn't mind if it was some other actress in her place. The Jon Favreau-Jaime Pressley couple however is a riot. Overall, I LOVE YOU, MAN is an enjoyable comedy that may not be everyone but everyone would agree with the concept sooner or later.",8,0,2,21 March 2009
Concussion," Will Smith at his best
","#Concussion has made me see what athletes go through from a different angle and I'm saying that as a man who didn't grow up a fan of American football. CONCUSSION is a compelling David Vs. Goliath story, it's a true great American story, and it's Will Smith's best performance since 2006's 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' Written and directed by Peter Landesman, based on the GQ article 'Game Brain,' you've all seen the trailer for CONCUSSION which has Will Smith playing real life accomplished forensic neuropathologist, Dr. Bennet Omalu, who discovered a disease called Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) which a progressive degenerative disease found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma, and it's commonly found nowadays in pro-football player because they get repeated bows to the head every time they play, this is a heavy contact sport, as we all know.So the film is about this immigrant doctor with high ethical standards and he truly loves America and yet the America he loves seems to be trying to shut him up because he's basically going up against the sport Americans live and breath for and one of the biggest most capitalistic organizations in the country. When you're messing with a giant business because you've discovered a truth about them that they don't like or a truth that might hurt their profit-making, you're bound to get bullied by the giant.I had my worries at first, I thought Will Smith's attempt on Nigerian accent may distract or it may make him into a caricature instead of an embodiment but fortunately, that's not what happened. Will Smith's performance in this film really burns with convictions, he will have you take his side in a heartbeat. There's a bit of 'A Few Good Men' 'tell me the truth you can't handle the truth' sorta moment mixed with Denzel Washington's 'love's gonna bust me out' moment in 'Hurricane' so it's clear that over the years, Will has learned from his fellow masters and honed his skills or his artistry to perfection. Somebody told me once that Will is a big fan of the Philadelphia Eagles team, so it's interesting to see him play the role of a man who takes on the NFL.The film itself is set in a way that makes you feel like you're going on an uphill battle. I think writer/director Peter Landesman approached it in a way that doesn't demonize American football, but sheds a light on the truth about it, just like what the real Dr. Omalu did. It is also a story about immigrants, a fact which sadly a lot of Americans today seem to forget, that we are a nation of immigrants.CONCUSSION will surely give rise to discussions not just among NFL players and team owners but also among audiences and football fans. But will the discussion only last a dinner table's length and then be forgotten once Sunday game comes around again? I read up after watching the movie and found that the NFL still makes excuses in admitting the impact CTE has on their players. They've done settlements, they've paid millions of dollars to families, they've changed some things about the way the game is played but keep in mind that this is a big money-making business, so when money is at stake, unfortunately human lives get negotiated over.The way the NFL handles this reminds me of how right wing politicians try to repudiate climate change, by hiring their own scientists, some of whom may not even be experts on the field study, because those politicians have been bought by fossil fuel businesses. So point being, change in America can happen but it does not happen overnight, it's a slow and painful process as long as there's money involved.",10,45,77,26 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," Very Tarantino
","As a fan of Quentin Tarantino's, I'm genuinely disappointed with his latest film, THE HATEFUL EIGHT. Not that it's not well-made, not that it's not well-written, we all know that nobody writes like Tarantino does, but this is a complete rehash of everything he's ever done. If you've seen Tarantino's previous movies, you've pretty much seen THE HATEFUL EIGHT.About the 70mm experience, unfortunately the press screening I attended had the screen out of focus and I doubt that what we the press were watching that day was exactly what Quentin Tarantino had wanted for us when he shot this with Ultra Panavision. I'm not an expert on cameras, but it was obvious that it didn't come close because I remember some of the critics were furious during the intermission, rightfully so because the 70mm is supposed to be the film's biggest selling point. Come to think of it, the 70mm is now the film's ONLY selling point to me because it could've been shot in IMAX or 3D or ultra panavision, I personally care more about the story and the characters and THE HATEFUL EIGHT doesn't really offer anything new. That said, I did admire some of the shots that the great cinematographer Robert Richardson took for this film. They make you feel like you're out in the open wide and excruciatingly cold spaces. Much of it also reminds me of Roger Deakins' work on The Coen Bros' western remake, 'True Grit,' not too long ago.Starring a few of Tarantino's usual suspects like Michael Madsen, Tim Roth, Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell, plus newbies in the gang like Channing Tatum and Demian Bichir, THE HATEFUL EIGHT is set in post-civil war, a stagecoach is struggling through the wintry Wyoming landscape. The passengers are bounty hunter John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his prisoner/fugitive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). They pick up an African American Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and a self-proclaimed town sheriff, Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) along the way. They seek refuge at a stagecoach stopover called Minnie's Haderbashery where they are greeted by unfamiliar faces. There's something fishy about them, Ruth suspects that one of them may be working with Domergue to help her escape.Look, I'm not saying that this is an entirely bad movie, I was still entertained by it for the very same reasons why Tarantino movies in general entertain me. THE HATEFUL EIGHT has sharp and long speeches/dialogues that just roll off the actors' tongues proudly. I think every actor would feel blessed for the opportunity to say the lines that Tarantino had written. But as I implied earlier, THE HATEFUL EIGHT has the whodunit mystery ala 'Reservoir Dogs,' the non-linear timeline ala 'Pulp Fiction,' the excessive use of N-word ala 'Django Unchained,' and of course, it also has Tarantino's over the top brutal violence. And it's not really designed or meant to attract new fans either. So if this were to get nominated for best screenplay category, I would very much be surprised by that because we're still fresh from 'Django Unchained' which did give Tarantino his 2nd Oscar win.But in any case, just like most of Tarantino's movies, this is also a great opportunity for his actors to really own it and for this one, that goes to Jennifer Jason Leigh and Walton Goggins, both of whom I think excel the most out of the entire cast. Leigh in particular, despite not having much to say until probably the last couple of hours or so, manages to captivate me. Covered in blood, devilishly angry, there's a commanding force about Leigh so much so that even if you're not on her character's side, you can't help but be in awe.THE HATEFUL EIGHT is 168 minutes long, it has intermission like back in the old days. If you're planning to watch it via the upcoming roadshow, I highly recommend it, although I'm not sure if the theaters agreeing to this would ultimately get their investment's worth. After all, 70mm film-watching experience hasn't been around since the 60s. Filmmakers everywhere will always try to find the next big thing when it comes to making their films seem more immersive for their audience. The choice is theirs. But if it were up to me, if I was the filmmaker, I'd just hire cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki ('Gravity,' 'Birdman,' 'The Revenant') every single time, he'll get it immersive for ya!",5,24,61,21 December 2015
Moana," Enjoyable! But it's way too Disney
","If there's such a crime for being too Disney, MOANA would be guilty of it. Now, before you attack me with torches and pitchforks, let me say that I enjoy this film, but in the traditional Disney animation sense, it really doesn't get more generic or more formulaic than MOANA.Directed by the team who gave us 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Aladdin,' 'Hercules,' and 'The Princess And The Frog,' Ron Clements and John Musker this time take us to the islands of oceania, across the vast pacific where a teenager named Moana, wonderfully voiced by newcomer Auli'i Cravalho, dreams of voyaging across the open sea, just like her people's ancestors did. Her father however, the head chief, doesn't want that for his daughter, he wants her safe. But under the guidance of her late grandmother, Moana decides to venture off in order to find the demigod Maui, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, who years ago stole a certain object that would restore Moana's island that's being threatened by a curse. On this adventurous journey, Moana and Maui encounter obstacles along the way, find strength in each other's confidence and fulfill their destiny.I admit, a big part of why I was looking forward to this film is to listen to the new music, the original new songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Mancina and Opetaia Foa'i. And they did not disappoint us. All of the songs for this film should be nominated for Oscar, they're so lively, they fit the whole theme about legacy, and they're just extremely catchy, and the music sounds very islander too, I think if you're a cinephile or a Disney fan that comes from that part of the world, you'll immediately fall in love with the songs in MOANA, I guarantee it.As far as the characters and the story go, as I said earlier, MOANA is quite formulaic, I know some people might use the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' argument and to a certain extent, yes if it has worked in the past, then why change it. Obviously Ron Clements and John Musker are representative of Disney cinema, and they consistently take that with them from one movie to the next. So there's song and dancing, there's spiritual guidance, there's a sidekick pet, there's supernatural magical elements, and there's a giant arrogant but lovable friend and of course, our lead hero ultimately discovers his or her true identity. It's as if there's a specific equation that Clements and Musker always come back to and would never ever deviate from. I give MOANA a million credit for giving us Disney's first islander princess, we definitely needed one, you can always count me in for diversity. But if you've come to see a more original or a different kind of Disney movie, you'll have a better chance with 'Zootopia.' If you've come just for a good old fashioned Disney movie that's pretty safe and very familiar and fun for the whole family, then enjoy MOANA.-- Rama's Screen --",7,1,12,19 November 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Iron Spider: Homecoming
","So here's my review of Iron Spider Homecoming.. ehm.. I meant to say #SpiderManHomecoming. It's an incredibly fun teen movie but it's not perfect. I think Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker, he's got the character down spot on. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield but Tom Holland's version is like straight out of the pages. But with this reboot, they basically plaster Iron Man's previous drama on to Spider-Man in addition to the new tech-based suit, so I'm not sure if that's going to sit well with all the fans.The events take place right after the colossal airport fight in 'Captain America: Civil War,' young Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tom Holland) is stoked about helping Iron Man and looking forward to the next mission. But he seems to have been sidelined by his new mentor, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) Peter goes about his high school life with his best friend and decathlon classmates, when Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as the new villain.There's a bit of John Hughes influence in 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' and that's a good thing considering Hughes was a legend when it comes to chronicling high school dramas, so it's natural for any filmmaker that's handling the same subject to be taking inspiration from his movies. I think Holland's fellow young co-stars are just as perfect in their roles. And Michael Keaton is superb. The movie doesn't have to keep hammering the whole working class man getting screwed over by the rich and powerful because Keaton himself already does a good job of conveying that. I enjoy the vibrancy of the chases because the movie keeps reminding us that Spider-Man can't go immediately from one location to another so Spider-Man has to hitch a ride or trespass a backyard or crashes a sleepover tent.But because the humor really works, the drama has to come from somewhere else. They remove the origin story involving Uncle Ben and they also remove the 'With great power comes great responsibility' essence, and they replace those with the dilemmas that Tony Stark had to experience in his previous film which asked the question of can a superhero be a superhero without his suit. To some, this might make sense so as to give us Spidey stripped down to his element. While others might see it as an effort to include Spidey in the MCU that comes with the risk of turning our friendly neighborhood hero into something else. The tech-based suit does provide some of the film's hilarious moments, but at times it makes Peter Parker/Spidey even more bumbling than he should be. So I'm not suggesting that iron-manizing Spider- Man is a terrible idea but clearly there are just too many MCU fingerprints all over what's supposed to be a Spider-Man new solo movie. The classic song might as well go like this 'Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever Iron Man can.'-- Rama's Screen --",8,17,44,29 June 2017
Black Mass," Johnny Depp, as Whitey Bulger, is scary.
","Scott Cooper, the director who gave us 'Crazy Heart,' and 'Out Of The Furnace' came back with this ambitious film, and I say that because Jimmy 'Whitey' Bulger' is among the most famous of all gangsters in the entire history of crime families in this country. His name is up there on the same level as Al Capone and the rest of those scums. So it's good that this movie doesn't glorify Whitey Bulger in any way.As I've said a thousand times before, I'm a sucker for mob stories and police corruption stories because a). they're a perfect example of a villain, acting nice in front of people but doing other wise behind closed doors and b). the unholy alliance between the two like the one depicted in this film is kind that unfortunately will always continue to happen in many other places. It will always exist, no matter how many crime 'heads' you try to cut off.BLACK MASS takes instruction from Martin Scorsese's manual book, as does any other gangster movie that has been made since 'Goodfellas.' It starts out with a young kid who gets to join the Winter Hill gang, but the focus remains on Whitey Bulger, brilliantly played by Johnny Depp, an actor who I think hasn't been in touch with his dark side since 2007's 'Sweeney Todd,' (let's forget that whole mess 'Transcendence' ever happened) so it's nice to have Depp back as the baddie. And boy, as Bulger, Depp immerses himself and strikes fear into the hearts of the people around him. He's like Joe Pesci's Tommy DeVito in 'Goodfellas' but times a hundred, BLACK MASS even has Depp's Bulger intimidate a person sitting across from him; that person thinks Bulger is angry at him, reminiscent of Tommy's 'What's so funny?' scene. This is Depp's best performance in years.Those of us fans of gangster movies know how the game is played and so does BLACK MASS, you just know when somebody would get whacked, you just know when somebody says the wrong thing to a boss, you just know when the noose is tightening and their empire starts to crumble. In this case, Joel Edgerton plays FBI agent John Connolly who helps Bulger, hoping that Bulger would help him in return but instead Bulger uses him. The way Edgerton plays his character is that he's not your traditional 'dirty' lawman, he's not planted there by winter hill gang. He's a cocky, incompetent lawman, he in way over his head, the kind of guy who'd rather make excuses than face up to his own blunder and it eventually bites him in the butt.My thing is that if the government has to settle for torture session or if law enforcement has to settle for cooperating with the mob, if those are their last resort, claiming that there's no other choice, then they're actually just lazy and unwilling to put the time and effort in good old detective police work. BLACK MASS gives you a brutal inside look at one of this country's most notorious monsters.",9,3,10,18 September 2015
Doctor Strange," An incredible mindtrip
","Wow! DOCTOR STRANGE is an incredible mindtrip. Its VFX alone makes Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' look like some kind of beta test. And this film is so much fun, it's hilarious, it's got some of the most complex, most elaborate action sequences I've seen all year, and I can't stop geekin' out about the cloak of levitation. This is Benedict Cumberbatch making his grand entrance into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Directed by Scott Derrickson who helped provide the script, DOCTOR STRANGE is about a successful, talented, arrogant neurosurgeon, Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Suddenly, a tragic car accident leaves Strange's hands permanently damaged, which means he can no longer perform surgery. After trying western medicine, he hears of a man who was badly injured and then got miraculously healed, this leads Strange to the secrets of a hidden world of alternate dimensions. Under the teaching and guidance of the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) Strange unleashes metaphysical abilities and ultimately takes on the responsibility of protecting earth from mystical threats.Created by Marvel's legendary artist, Steve Ditko, the character Doctor Strange is a very unique one because he's not a product of some kind of technological armor, he's not a nordic god nor a space alien, and he doesn't get his powers from super serum nor gamma rays, and so kudos to Marvel Studios for taking a chance on this one of a kind character because it makes for an unbelievably fantastic origin story on screen that's just different from the rest of the bunch that Marvel has introduced to us so far. And there's just something refreshing about that.What a great cast, they could not have picked a better lead star, Benedict Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park. Whenever Strange gets a bit cocky, you can see a little bit of Cumberbatch's Sherlock attitude kicking in there. But Strange is more quick to sensibility whereas Sherlock would still have to put them all through his reasoning filters. And Cumberbatch's sense of humor is absolutely sharp. There's a ton of funny moments in this film but they never take away from the problem at hand or what Strange has to tackle at that very moment.I'm Asian but I'm not bothered by Tilda Swinton playing the Ancient One, I understand this is supposedly the film's biggest controversy but the fact of the matter is that once you've seen DOCTOR STRANGE, you'll understand why Tilda is perfect in this role. The woman is an impeccable actress and she exudes the specific wisdom needed for this because in many ways, when you deal with a monastery-like setting where people learn martial art and philosophies about self- control, the expectation is that the master would preach parables, analogies, or metaphors in bestowing that wisdom and Tilda does it with ease like David Carradine's Kwai Chang Caine from the old 'Kung Fu' series.Mads Mikkelsen's Kaecilius, I gotta say, is not my favorite villain in MCU, I think Mikkelsen does a fine job but the character just doesn't land for me. But I gotta give Scott Derrickson and his co-writers much credit for introducing as many elements as they could from Doctor Strange comic books including Dormammu, and so those who watch the film and may be confused by the jargons, like the Eye of Agamotto, can go to the comic books and discover why it is important to include those in a Doctor Strange movie along with the manipulation of space, energy and time which is also another big deal. And that leads me to what I think is the film's most amazing appeal,.. seeing buildings bend over on itself, characters teleporting, and the insane things that the cloak of levitation can do because it carries its own consciousness. It really doesn't get more of a movie magic than DOCTOR STRANGE.-- Rama's Screen --",9,186,320,23 October 2016
21 Jump Street," Are you ready for a lifetime of badasses?
","-- www.Ramascreen.com --I had my doubts about this, because I grew up watching the original series and so the idea for the movie version to go raunchy comedy instead of serious drama, was a bit off-putting at first. But 21 JUMP STREET proves me wrong. Jonah Hill and screenwriter Michael Bacall's sense of humor targets those of us who loved Superbad. And Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller clearly were having a blast with the drug jokes, teen party, and the F-bombs and other juvenile mishaps, the movie is filled with one relevant pop culture reference after another. 21 JUMP STREET may not be consistently funny but it has all the elements of an exciting buddy cop comedy. And the surprise cameos by some of the notable faces from the original series, (SPOILER ALERT) Holly Robinson Pete, Peter DeLouise, and Johnny Depp make the movie all the more special¬Ö The original series 21 JUMP STREET was basically about undercover cops handling youth crime, plain and simple, I remember it being a character driven story. The movie, though R-rated comedy, does a damn good job to respect that. It seems as if Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum's characters find themselves in the same division that Depp and the gang used to work in back in the '80s but times have changed now, leadership has changed, even the hierarchy and what's considered cool and not cool in high schools have changed.2 people from different backgrounds, one's a jock, the other is a nerd, are forced to become friends in the Police Academy when they discover that they could progress if they'd just help each other out. They think being cops are being 24/7 badasses everyday, little do they know that most of the duties require patrolling and paperwork and routines, things that they don't care too much for. 21 JUMP STREET's comedy plays on stereotype but not in a mean, tasteless way, it's more playful and like a wink and a nudge. The jock, played by Tatum, is a handsome devil but an airhead. The nerd, played by Hill, is a bit heavy and insecure. The perfect odd couple. The comedy could get outrageous, it's got different steps or levels of drug effects and some of the scenes do drag a bit, the investigation is not too complex, but the script is surprisingly well-structured, I said surprisingly because I was just expecting the worst. Both the jock and the nerd finally get themselves to tap into a side of themselves they never knew they had all along.If you don't think Hill deserved his Oscar nod for Moneyball, you'd think twice before making that argument the next time, because the dude is hella talented, he's a young actor who responds to his role positively no matter how dumb the role would require him to behave. Tatum's comedic timing comes with him being able to confidently stand in the middle of confusion and awkwardness, he probably channels some of that from being considered a hunk by ladies in real life on a daily basis. Ice Cube as the loud, hot-head Lieutenant is a treat to watch, the same goes for Brie Larson who I'm betting will surely but slowly become the next starlet, you just wait and see. The movie pays homage to the series, it doesn't disrespect it at all, in fact, the cameos by the original stars serve as a way for them to say goodbye to their old roles and pass the torch on to Hill and Tatum; to wish them well. This is one comedy that gets me hoping for a sequel -- www.Ramascreen.com --",8,3,13,13 March 2012
Watchmen," It was just OK, that was all
","This is a review from yours truly and I haven't read the graphic novel WATCHMEN and the movie adaptation.. well, let's just say that it's stylish and visually breathtaking and¬Ö those are its strongest points. There's too much character development, I think it could've been trimmed down and we're still fresh from having watched the great Dark Knight that all of WATCHMEN dark, gloomy profundity and depth in the complexity of its story seem like just an average attempt to do the same. I don't mind the movie's strong graphic violence, in fact, if Zack Snyder had took it down a notch, it would've took away what's left of its wow factor.I don't deny the power of this movie's visual effects. Stunning doesn't even begin to express how amazed I am at the ability to take your sight to all kinds of exciting levels. It's as if the effects used in Zack Snyder's 300 was injected with steroid and there you have WATCHMEN. I'm also equally impressed with the cinematography and although I didn't read the book, I gotta hand it to Zack Snyder and his team for coming up with shots that you just know are comic-book like, it goes to show the extent they're willing to take to satisfy the fans. Granted, some say the ending was changed, be that as it may but it doesn't take away the fact that it is obvious that they also want to cater to those who've never read the book and that is also the downside, resulting in a running time that's just too damn long for a movie watching experience.Having said that, the whole bullet time effects or where things get faster and slower and faster again in one single frame happens way too often, you'd get tired of it after the second hour. I'm aware that Zack Snyder wants to introduce each character's origin story especially to those not familiar with WATCHMEN but each of those stories could've been done in a much faster, less dramatic manner. The song selections for the most part are not too shabby, except for one particular sex scene and the soundtrack song 'Hallelujah'. It throws me off because they don't compliment each other. You see Patrick Wilson and Malin Akerman thrusting and moaning meanwhile the song in the background just doesn't fit the mood. It's borderline hilarious. Keeping in mind again, I've never read the book.. so I guess what makes me not want to stand up and applaud is its supposed prophetic relation to 9/11 conspiracy, of how one disaster is secretly designed and massively executed in order to unite nations. I understand that the whole storyline is covered with political messages but that one just gets a bit too obvious and too preachy.Actingwise I think all of them give great performances, Jeffrey Dean Morgan surprisingly is excellent as a man who's done some terrible things in his life and when he figures out an even bigger more terrible masterplan, his conscience gets the better of him. Top honor goes to Jackie Earl Haley who plays Rorschach, quite possibly the most badass of all WATCHMEN characters. Before I forget, the fight choreography is amazing. When they fight, you can almost feel like the wind just got knocked out of you. Is WATCHMEN in the same level as Zack Snyder's previous movie 300? It's arguable, but WATCMEN could certainly have been much more enjoyable.--Rama's SCREEN--",7,0,2,8 March 2009
The Revenant," If this doesn't get Leonardo DiCaprio his first Oscar win, I don't know what will.
","The terms 'immersive' and 'visceral' are often loosely used, but THE REVENANT has taken strong ownership of them, and all it takes is director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's sharp and creative directing and maestro cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's distinctive camera style and seamless edits that take us through the landscape, up close and personal. THE REVENANT is one of those films that will be talked about for generations to come, whether it be at a film school among students and experts or at a coffee shop among aficionados who've just seen one of the most incredible films ever.The character Hugh Glass is a legend when it comes to the history of the frontier, these are the times before the things we often associate with wild wild west. Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and co-scribe Mark L. Smith take source from Michael Punke's novel but they put a fictional twist of their own on this actual historical character, played in the film by the great Leonardo DiCaprio. In this film, Hugh Glass has a mixed race son because he was once had native-American wife, Glass and his son join fur-trapping business that got attacked by the natives, one of the people in their expedition is John Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy. One day, Glass gets mauled by a bear and left for dead by his team members. Fitzgerald is one of the three staying behind to care for Glass and to give him a proper burial should he passes. But Fitzgerald kills Glass' son and takes off instead, an event which then motivates Glass to survive in his relentless pursuit of revenge.Whether it be interior like 'Birdman' or outdoors like 'The Revenant,' Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is a director who's committed to taking the audience to fully experience because he understands the wide range and the scale and he also fully understands the stories of these characters and he smartly conveys them to you. Yes, it's a primal existential survival story, yes it's also a revenge and redemption story, yes it's also father and son story, but the way Alejandro films it, the way he tells it, makes THE REVENANT more nuanced than that. And just like how this film manages to transport you to a land and time that's rarely tackled in cinema, it also successfully transports visual spectacle to a new height that's never before seen nor felt. The sequence in which Leonardo DiCaprio's Hugh Glass gets mauled by a bear, for example, it's as if you could feel Glass and the bear's breath. This is also why Lubezki is one of the greatest of all-time because his cinematography aims to make you feel like you're present there, you see the angles, the edges of the screen, everything about it is very welcoming, very inclusive.This is Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance yet, one of the things that makes him a great actor is that he's clever in his rhythmical movement and facial expressions, he's on point, he knows how to make a scene more emotional or more intense, this is an actor who gives his all for his characters, and you see that dedication once again in THE REVENANT, working in toughest most uncomfortable conditions, he even strips down naked, Leo's devotion to this character, Hugh Glass, is admirable. Tom Hardy also gives an equally outstanding performance as the villain, Fitzgerald, who's only looking out for number one, what matters to Fitzgerald are himself and his ambitions, he doesn't have a problem with kicking integrity or honor to the curb if need be. And so when Hugh Glass ultimately gets in the way, it's kill or be killed mode for Fitzgerald and Hardy, with his sturdy intimidating stature, accomplishes that.THE REVENANT is a beautifully shot film, much of it will remind you of the works of writer/director Terrence Malick, whom Emmanuel Lubezki collaborated with several times including 'The New World.' There's something majestic, something grand about THE REVENANT and at the same time, there's also something inspiring and hopeful about it. THE REVENANT is a work of art, a masterpiece.",10,27,77,21 December 2015
Knowing," Alex Proyas' Close encounters of the third kind
","KNOWING is director Alex Proyas' Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Proyas doesn't make many movies and often takes long breaks in between but when he makes one, it's bound to leave an impression (The Crow, Dark City, I Robot) and KNOWING is an instant cult hit. KNOWING is a... sci-fi thriller drama that grabs your attention and never lets go. It's suspenseful, haunting, and mysterious with excellent journey into the human paranoia and our desperate need to know the future no matter how grim it might look. You don't have to be a geek to enjoy this, just keep your mind open to the possibilities and let Proyas excite your senses.KNOWING finally redeems Nicolas Cage who's been attached to some pretty lame movies in recent years. In this one, he still has that The Wicker Man character that at first concerns me but as the movie progresses, I can tell that he's very convincing and heartfelt as a dad whose loss of his wife has made him faithless and his son is the only thing that keeps him going. There's something about characters like this that makes it easy for us to relate to, which is a big part of why Will Smith's performance in I Am Legend was a success.Director Alex Proyas has a special place in the hearts of geeks everywhere because he caters to this target audience and he does it well. His direction of KNOWING combines the usual over-dramatic clich√©s like dropping the glass on the floor or Nic Cage spinning his car abruptly as he parks at the gas station with the elements of heartpounding moments before intense surprises that will keep you begging for more.The movie has breathtaking visual effects. The plane crash and the train collision and end of the world disaster are unlike anything that anything you've ever seen. It's not your typical attempts ala Roland Emmerich (Day after Tomorrow, Independence Day) Rose Byrne who plays a single mother, might not have an extensive movie resume yet but it's plain to see that she's very comfortable under the direction of Proyas, to just let herself loose in the panic and fear that a mother would experience when danger is about to threaten her daughter.Great screenplay by the team of writers including Ryne Douglas Pearson who came up with this engaging story. The dialogue might not be the most clever things you've heard out there but it's not overdone either, what I appreciate is that despite how far-fetched the concept maybe, the conversations could seem like they would somehow make sense. The character development is there and well-executed, the scenes for it are appropriately placed and we understand exactly the motivation behind the actions that the characters choose to take.I wanna give props to composer Marco Beltrami, who was Oscar nominated for 3:10 To Yuma. His original score for KNOWING is one that give you a little bit of sixth-sense and some majestic awe during the end scene.Speaking of which, I was a bit worried when the last scene starts to reveal itself, I thought 'o no here's another Indiana Jones 4 fiasco' but nope, I like how Proyas and his people architect the whole thing so that it would not look cheesy and it would still have that grand effect that will stick with you after you leave the theaters.--Rama's SCREEN--",9,5,11,21 March 2009
Hugo," A refreshing, wondrous detour for the great Scorsese!
","-- Ramascreen.com --HUGO is a refreshing, wondrous detour for Scorsese. It's not one of my top favorite Scorsese films of all time but it works as a family movie. I can imagine the great director just having fun with this material and the 3D aspects, he's like a kid in a candy store, not to mention it gives him the chance to pay homage to silent films and his love of cinema in general. HUGO is for those of us who find escape in the world of movies I've never read the best seller that became the basis for this movie but when I heard that it has a bit to do with an orphan and the story is somewhat of a period piece, I thought we were in for another version of Oliver Twist-type story. And perhaps certain elements of HUGO would give some people that impression. HUGO's set design, the visual, the 3D, the costume, the cinematography, everything about the environment is both marvelous and captivating. A while back I thought this kind of film should be better handled by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the director who brought us 2001‚Ä≤s Amelie, but Scorsese proves that he too can deliver something that wildly imaginative and magical. One of the most visually arresting films in recent years. Some of the best scenes I enjoy in HUGO are the ones that deal with the silent films. To watch Kingsley and McCrory re-enact some of those films is a delight.The first half of the story loses my interest, partially because I feel that the father-son relationship is a bit rushed and I find the interaction between Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Moretz) not engaging enough but I warm up to it after the heart-shaped key comes into play, my curiosity kicks in high gear from that point on. Chloe Moretz's accent goes on and off but her character is so friendly and supportive, you quickly dismiss her tough attempt on the accent. The design they have for the automoton, the mechanic figure that can write, is nothing short of fascinating. I wonder if I could put that on my Christmas wish list this year, it'd be cool to own one.I think it's appropriate to have the great chameleon actor Ben Kingsley portray who many consider to be one of the fathers of early cinema, Georges M√©li√®s. As M√©li√®s, Kingsley makes you see that the spark in his eyes and the excitement in his heart, his belief in dreams have long gone. Hugo's little sad story leads to a discovery of a grand story that opens the door to a celebrated past.Nothing is left hanging in this film, every character has a purpose and each purpose connects with one another. Even the ruthless station inspector, well played by Sacha Baron Cohen, who hunts down orphans as part of his job, has depth and he, of all people, should understand what Hugo is going through because he's a grown result of the resentment over the system that he wants to throw Hugo into. I think the 3 big key characters here are Hugo Cabret, M√©li√®s and the Station inspector and they collide perfectly in this cinematic enchantment straight from the heart of Martin Scorsese.-- Ramascreen.com --",8,5,11,23 November 2011
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," You Got To Move It, Move It!
","Rarely have I seen animated family sequel movie that's as good or better than its predecessor but speaking as a movie freak who didn't like the first installment, I gotta say I'm very much entertained by MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa and it way funnier than the original movie. Dreamworks has a habit of doing this¬Ö what it lacks in its story and overall animation (Pixar still rules in those departments!) it makes up for it in its sense of humor. This is the movie that every age can enjoy and it has only a very, very few silly, lame moments but for the most part, you just got to move it, move it! The whole team is back, it doesn't take long for you to remember what each character is all about, there's no need for re-introduction but there is a bunch of new characters thrown in to the den without having to take us in unnecessary complication of having to understand what they are. The concept is simple and the jokes are funny. Here you see all the characters stranded in Africa and meet a their own kind. It's the freedom they've always wanted but don't really want at the same time. They have trouble fitting in and getting in touch with their heritage, all the while friendship and feelings are being put to the test resulting in an exciting adventure at the end that brings them closer together again. Kids will love it, Parents will be glad about it, and the rest of us will find it to be very amusing.MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa will feel like too short of a movie, but that's also something that I can appreciate because I don't think it has any intention of trying to be all Oscar worthy, it's nothing more than telling a light, enjoyable story with good moral value lesson and that's about it. If the running time were any longer, it would lose some of its target audience. Hands down, without dragging this review any more than it has to, the best part of this movie once again, are the penguins! Those dudes are hardcore gangsters and freakin' hilarious! They should have their own spin-off, stand-alone movie, just about them scheming something deviant and mission impossible-esquire. I could watch them work together and hear their smartass, cocky remarks/attitude about a thousand more times and they'll still crack me up. If you find no reason to watch this movie, then at least watch it to check out those awesome penguins.",8,121,166,25 October 2008
Monsters vs. Aliens," Destroy Monsters Vs. Aliens
","The thing is.. it's just not entirely entertaining. Maybe I expected more and had my hopes up so it's probably partly my fault but MONSTERS Vs. ALIENS is just an average family movie. It's got some amusing moments, a few scenes that will¬Ö get you to chuckle a bit, Kids will love it, parents will love it, but the rest of us however will be saying 'okay, next!' Thank God it has the 3D because otherwise I'd be staring at my wristwatch from beginning to the end.I'm okay with 3D movie, I welcome any awesomeness that could enhance our movie watching experience but if the movie has humor that misses the target and a story way too easy for our intelligence, not even 3D could fully save the day. I respect the MONSTERS Vs. ALIENS trying to teach our young viewers the lesson of not looking at people like freaks or different because you never know, they might be the ones to keep the world from getting blown up by aliens. The movie uses the blue character BOB as its poster boy because all the marketing indicates that he's the comic relief but I find the president to be the most hilarious, for some reason I don't know why, but Stephen Colbert gets the best lines in the movie.The action 'roller coaster ride' sequences are just OK, your typical scenes that you've felt in other movies before, it doesn't have that much of a thrill if you ask me. Reese Witherspoon's animated character, Susan is supposed to be the lead star and yet in the end we could care less for what would happen to her. I'm impressed with Keifer Sutherland's peculiar voice as the angry general, hearing the voice alone I wouldn't have figured out it was Kiefer. I don't wanna drag this review, point is¬Ö MONSTERS Vs. ALIENS is pointless, predictable, and over-hyped. You won't miss a thing if you never watch it. You shouldn't be surprised because Dreamworks animation is a hit-and-miss situation unlike Pixar that always lives up to its promise.--Rama's SCREEN--",3,18,37,27 March 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A superb and chilling thriller
","I've never read Stieg Larsson's millennium novels, so I can't say how  faithful this film is to the original material, but I am a big fan of  the Swedish adaptation by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev. Now, I  know the fact that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes annoys the hell  out of us, but I think there can always be room for different  interpretation, different vision and approach and that's what David  Fincher's version excels in. It's more detailed, more curious, and more  unafraid. It's a superb and chilling thriller with an astounding  performance by Rooney Mara. Whether or not this version is better can  be argued but it certainly is a solid film¬Ö   Rooney Mara, with her skinny body and goth hairstyle and excessive  piercings and tattoos and her attitude, I think Mara manages to give a  more complex Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace's portrayal. But it's  mostly thanks to screenwriter Steven Zaillian who covers information  that the previous adaptation would simply skim or just talk about  instead of exposing it. Fincher and Zaillian want to seriously show how  dark, troubled, but motivated Lisbeth is. And some may consider this  approach to be too brutal or unnecessary but I think it's no more  brutal than Fincher's previous thrillers like Se7en. This is after all,  in its essence, a movie made solely for Fincher's fans or those who are  comfortable with his style. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography work is  fantastic by the way, it plays on how much you can handle. It goes  along with the script that tends to be explanatory. Whatever loopholes  or gaps that the previous adaptation had, Fincher's film fills it and  explains it in its own way.  Lisbeth Salander to me is a rebel, she lives by her own rules, but  she's also by herself, this version wants to instill in her mind the  idea that perhaps she could be sociable or she could be considered  normal if she just gets that attention that she never did, and that's  what warrants a different ending. Mara is absolutely phenomenal as  Lisbeth, it's a defining role for Mara, she's made it her own. She's  fierce, highly driven, but there's a sense of innocence to her as well.  She thinks her anger and actions are justified and the film  successfully encourages us to agree.  All those tattoos and piercings are like 'keep off' or 'stay away'  sign, perhaps because of years of rough background, going from one  guardian to another, so when somebody genuine like Mikael Blomkvist  (Daniel Craig) comes along, he represents the safety that desperately  longs for but would never admit to. I think it's smart that Fincher and  Zailian shows the estranged family side of Blomkvist, they see it as  important for Blomkvist to be able to relate to Henrik Vanger's  (Christopher Plummer) dilemma and I think that's a smart move. Craig is  the weakest link because his accent keeps going on and off, I'm not  sure if he even tries to sound Swedish at all, it's quite the  distraction. But he works with what's given to him, keep in mind that  the title is not Blomkvist with the dragon tattoo.  Of course nowadays you can't talk about Fincher's movies without  talking a bit about the unconventional score by Oscar winners Atticus  Ross and Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor. In fact, the movie pays an  amusing homage to NIN. Those of you film score aficionados would  probably find Ross and Reznor's tunes for this film rather eerie and  chilling, which it then pretty much serve its purpose. Having said  that, at times I find the score a bit forceful and it's like the same  soundwave echoing over and over again with the intent to hypnotize. I  don't think the opening graphic credit is all that impressive, it's an  interesting take but it looks out of place, it looks like it should be  a separate music video and it doesn't necessarily introduce the tone of  the film that you're about to see.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is definitely not a movie for the faint  of heart, it's a movie that would rattle your comfort cage, and I think  audiences will be divided, you'll either truly love it, or truly detest  it, but there will hardly be a middle ground.",8,132,218,20 December 2011
Captain America: Civil War," Outstanding! Marvel is unstoppable!
","CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is the best Marvel movie yet. It's superhero conflict done right! Spectacular action sequences, it's well thought out, it's got nicely placed humor here and there, the plot and the motivations make sense, all the characters have fair share amount of screen time, and may I just say that the new Spider-Man is totally awesome! Even if you didn't grow up reading comic books, you will geek out every step of the way. This film is every bit as fun as 2012's 'The Avengers.' One of the many brilliant things that Marvel's Kevin Feige and his creative team and writers and directors did is that they already mapped out Marvel Cinematic Universe, they already know what A through Z will be and how to connect the dots in between. And so when Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) shows the Avengers the disastrous consequences of their saving-the-world efforts, we the audience feel the impact as well because we remember those individual movies which lead up to this installment, they're still fresh in our memories. And in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, the repercussion of Cap vs. The Winter Soldier continues to be force that drives the story forward, because it's actually more layered than we think.I know what you're going to ask me. What do I think of the new Spider-Man? Fair enough. Before we get to that, let me just say that my initial concerns that this movie would end up just being some kind of Avengers 2.5 instead of a Cap movie, because of the inclusion of so many characters, my initial concerns subside because again, by this time, Marvel already knows what they're doing, they know how to balance fun and intense action, they know that they have to showcase the skills and traits of each character instead of applying one size fits all. Screenwriters Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely with directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo are all master storytellers. OK.. so Spider-Man. He's alright. I'm kidding. He's awesome! And I truly mean that. Actor Tom Holland is perfect in this role. No offense to Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but Holland's version is the Spidey that we the fans have been anticipating and I'm not talking just about his wise-cracking sarcasm, Holland owns it, he embodies it, he has some of the coolest lines in this film. And this whole idea of picking up the character from the middle and putting him into the mix, is absolutely brilliant because Spider-Man's time in CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is as significant and as scene-stealing as Quicksilver was in 'X-Men: Days Of Future Past,' he's the one most fans will talk about long after this movie's done.Another great addition is Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and wait till you get a load of the surprise that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) will have for you in the well-choreographed airport scene which is the part where both teams ultimately clash. That said, there is an underlying secret, there is a common enemy so smart that he doesn't even have to get his hands dirty, that's how clever this script is, because it's more than just about Sokovia accords or putting superheroes in check, and the reason the characters clash makes sense, it's more than just about a simple payback. That ability to keep itself fresh at every turn is one of the many, many strengths of CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR. The story ends with you wondering if your favorite heroes would ever join forces again when a greater threat like Thanos finally comes to town. What an outstanding film with great performances across the board. In this year where Daredevil is fighting Punisher on TV, Superman is fighting Batman on the big screen and apparently Charlize Theron's Ravenna is fighting Emily Blunt's Freya in 'The Huntsman: Winter's War,'... CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR trumps all.-- Rama's Screen --",10,30,63,13 April 2016

If you don't dig silly, over the top scenes then you probably¬Ö would find this movie very annoying because frankly, it has that element and so much more. This is a comedy with a bang! Explosives and uproarious! Writer/director Ben Stiller and his fellow screenwriter Justin Theroux have made the awesome finale to the 2008 Summer movie season.It's a good thing Ben Stiller has so many A-list friends who are willing to appear in this movie even for a cameo.

Tom Cruise knows how to cuss up a storm and he looks funny when dancing to hip-hop music.TROPIC THUNDER can proudly claim Robert Downey Jr as its champ. His role as the Platoon's African American sergeant is priceless. You have never seen him like this. His accent and mannerism might be exaggerated a little, but he does not sound like Robert Downey Jr. at all. He's got the lingo down and his looks will forever crack me up. What a talented actor.This movie is not for those of you who are looking for clever comedy. Nope, this is for those of us who from time to time don't mind comedy who target audiences with short attention span. This movie's humor only works for those of us who just wanna sit back and enjoy some major entertainment.",8,7,21,20 July 2008
Inside Out," One the best films I've seen this year! Welcome back, Pixar!
","Last year we didn't get a Pixar movie, and the year before that, the only thing they gave us the fans was that easily forgettable 'Monsters University,' so it's good to see Pixar returning, full force, with this latest masterpiece, INSIDE OUT, which reminds us of how good Pixar is when they make well-written, well thought-out heartfelt original stories instead of sequels. INSIDE OUT is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I hope it would ultimately be a potential Oscar contender come award season because it deserves all the success.The way to describe Pixar's INSIDE OUT without wording it too much is that basically the minute you sit in that theater's seat to watch this movie, you're practically enrolled in Pixar's study of adolescent psychology 101. But I can assure, it's more fun than your regular boring class lectures. Co-directed by the man behind my #1 all-time favorite Pixar movie, 'Up,' Oscar-winning filmmaker Pete Docter and along with Ronaldo Del Carmen and scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, they crafted this elaborate, engaging and entertaining story that essentially could help parents everywhere who suddenly have to face the fact that their kids are no longer the little adorable kids they once knew; that stage between childhood and teenage years without necessarily going into the teenage years because Pixar is not in the business of doing horror movies. All joking aside, this movie wants to explain, in a very Pixar way, how young ones may resist change but that change is ultimately something to be accepted, and the emotions they go through in order to deal with that change.INSIDE OUT introduces 5 different emotions and present them in five very eccentric characters: Joy, anger, sadness, disgust, and fear. I'm not sure how many emotions we humans biologically have but Pixar settles on these five. And each of them is very into who they are, for example, fear would extremely be afraid at all times and joy can be so optimistic that she sounds annoying, makes you want to just punch her and tell her to shut the hell up. These five emotions live to serve a little girl named Riley who had a beautiful childhood, evidenced by her many fun and loving memories. Her childhood is every kid's envy, not that her family is rich but that her parents and friends were always there for her, and she loved her school, her neighborhood, her town. Until the day when Riley's family has to move to San Francisco and it's a completely drastic change for Riley. Joy is somewhat of the leader of this emotion command control, the rest would look up to her when they don't know what to do or when they don't know which emotion Riley should be feeling. And in Joy's mind, Riley should literally always be up and happy all the times. And that's when sadness comes in and feels compelled to touch the core memories. Long story short, without spoiling any critical plot points. Joy and Sadness end up by themselves, separated from the others, and away from the control room, so they have to find their way back and it's not an easy journey.The concept itself is brilliant, Pete and his filmmaking team created these 'Islands' to represent certain aspects that we humans may be surrounded with as a child: friendship, family, the ability to be goofy. But as we grow up, those islands will crumble. In their journey back, Joy and Sadness encounter imagination character named Bing Bong and at first when I watched the movie, I thought Bing Bong was going to be the antagonist, but there's not really an antagonist in this story. Even these emotions themselves, just like Riley, would have to learn that things aren't always going to stay the same forever. The animation is Pixar's most pristine work yet. The moment Riley was born, the emotions miraculously existed and their hair and body look like they're made up of some sort of sparkling floating firefly lights of blue, green, yellow, red, and purple, like you want to get close and just examine them in details.Pete Docter was very smart to have cast this amazing group of funny people to voice these emotions. Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Bill Hader as Fear, Mindy Kaling as disgust, and the legendary Lewis Black as Anger. I mean c'mon here, all these guys are practically born to voice these particular emotions, especially Lewis Black who's spent most his career being labeled the angry comedian, that's how he banks his humor. The stars are aligned for INSIDE OUT. The tone is what you'd expect in a Pixar movie, a mix of fun, thrill, adventure and moments that can make you cry, but it's a healthy cry, composer Michael Giacchino's music knows which buttons to push to get those tears flowing. I don't think INSIDE OUT means to tell parents that this is what you should or shouldn't do. It's simply an illustration, Pixar-style, describing that change is inevitable, it's part of growing up, but if you'll be there for your loved ones and just listen to them, they'll invite you to be part of that change and that's family moving forward.",10,8,34,17 June 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Your mission this weekend, should you choose to accept it, is to go watch this movie!
","-- www.Ramascreen.com --Your mission this weekend, should you choose to accept it, is to go watch MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ‚Äì GHOST PROTOCOL because it is downright awesome! What a great way to end 2011. It's non stop adrenaline rush from start to end. The IMAX sequences are exhilarating. The best Mission: Impossible movie yet. Tom Cruise is even crazier than I thought. Say what you want but he's still the man! Director Brad Bird's first live action movie is a success, he is after all the director of one of the most creative and elaborate action films of the last decade, The Incredibles. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ‚Äì GHOST PROTOCOL is the reason why you and I love going to the movies¬Ö I wasn't a big fan of the first two Mission: Impossible movies because the first one had a twist that was irritating and the second one relied too heavily on John Woo's love for slo-mo and doves. Both films didn't have solid stories that I could hold on to and their action scenes only went so far. The previous installment, Mission Impossible III, directed by J.J. Abrams, was a step in the right direction. It was more or less like a movie version of Alias, because it carried much of the spy series' concept, but with Tom Cruise as the star. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ‚Äì GHOST PROTOCOL is an upgrade and it's got 'fun' written all over it.All of the characters in this film have complications of their own, keep in mind that these movies are essentially about teamwork. Even the old series that this franchise is based on was about teamwork. Which is another thing why the first two movies didn't impress me but the third and this one did. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt may be the leader but Mission: Impossible should not just be about him, he's not James Bond.To me, Hunt is a daredevil, he's the kind of guy who wouldn't think twice about throwing himself in front of a speeding bus if it means defeating a terrorist's plan. Cruise control is back! Cruise almost always runs or sprints in his movies and boy does he run in this one or what! That scene atop the tallest building in the world, Burj Khalifa, will blow your mind. Any audience who's afraid of heights would grab their seat's armrests even tighter. You'll have newfound respect for Cruise after watching him do his Spidey/Cirque du Soleil stunt. I think it's a brilliant move to have some of the sequences shot in IMAX because I personally think it's a more immersive experience than any post-convert 3D could ever offer.Simon Pegg returns as the computer and tech geek Benji who is now also a field agent, so Pegg's comic relief job is not tied to his desk anymore, it's more about him being nervous and excited, trying to look cool and badass like Ethan. Should he wear masks? Could he shoot? He's like a kid who wants to try everything. There are two new agents introduced in this installment, the beautiful Paula Patton plays an agent who's dealing with her own thirst for revenge. There's a certain girl fight in this film that's pretty hardcore. Jeremy Renner is a chief analyst with certain skills and secrets of his own. We get to see how all these four individuals eventually come to trust each other.I love the opening credit and the ending and how they make 'ghost protocol' and Ethan Hunt look ghostly, as if they could disappear into thin air. It speaks about the life of a secret agent. The actions drive the story, what's interesting about this movie is that every mission the team takes on, whether it's in Kremlin or Mumbai or Dubai, something always happens that doesn't make the plan go smoothly so that intensifies the thrill. It takes you to new levels of danger and threat that are ever present and imminent, you wonder how it would all work out, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE ‚Äì GHOST PROTOCOL is an absolute blast!-- www.Ramascreen.com --",10,5,9,15 December 2011
Ex Machina," One of this year's best.
","It's as if Alex Garland had found the key and unlocked the door that most filmmakers today are still trying to locate. EX MACHINA is both beautiful and scary, hitchcockian and I loved ever minute of it. From the production design to the visual effects, from the performances to the story, everything moves smoothly like a well-oiled machine.Alex Garland is the scribe who gave us '28 Days Later,' 'Sunshine,' 'Dredd,' and EX MACHINA marks his feature directorial debut which he also scripted, it's a high sci-fi concept about artificial intelligence and it tackles things that you haven't seen other movies about A.I.'s have tackled before and it's because they's mostly focus on what happens after the A.I. is up and running or they'd focus on teaching the A.I. like you would a little kid, whereas EX MACHINA covers what happens before that, it wrestles with the psychology, the conscience and the sexuality of it all, that big million-dollar question of whether a machine can feel and decide like we humans do.I actually enjoyed Alex Garland-scripted 2007 sci-fi, 'Sunshine' but the third act turned into a mess that was all over the place, and 2010's 'Never Let Me Go' adaptation wasn't perfect either, thankfully it seems that he has since honed his sci-fi storytelling skills. But you can't really analyze this film without discussing the plot first, so here it is, without any spoiler. Domhnall Gleeson plays a programmer named Caleb Smith who works at an internet search engine company and he wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate owned by the company's CEO, Nathan Bateman, played by Oscar Isaac. But Caleb learns that Nathan actually chose him to be the human component in a Turing test on Nathan's artificial intelligence experiment named Ava. She's breathtaking but also she holds a different version of truth.One of the things fascinating about EX MACHINA is the way Garland dissects it into sessions in which Nathan would observe Caleb interact with Ava but they're separated by a glass. There would be frequent power outage and Ava would use those opportunities to tell Caleb to not trust Nathan. OK, if I say more, I'm afraid I might spoil stuff for you so let me just break it down right here, OK, EX MACHINA is pretty much a mind game, all the time you think you know who's playing who, until the table is turned and you'll see who's actually playing who at the end. Everything is a test. It's a smartly conceived thriller that takes its time.The debates between Caleb and Nathan put you in some kind of tug of war because one character would say something and you'd side with him and the other would say something that makes more sense and you'd switch side, just like that. Oscar Isaac's character, Nathan, seems to have an answer for everything, anytime Caleb presents a counter argument, Nathan gets it covered and he'd sell his point of view convincingly, you can't help but agree even though there's a part of you that questions his motif. Domhnall and Oscar are so good at these moments, it's that game of wit, between admiration and intellect, Oscar is extremely charismatic in his approach, Caleb is persistent and Alicia Vikander is a work of art as Ava, simply stunning.The setting is also breathtaking, the environment, this incredible looking smart house, it really makes Tom Cruise's space tower in Oblivion looks cheap. Everything about EX MACHINA looks polished and crisp, one cannot resist wanting to be there, to live there until, of course, the nightmare sinks in. Cinema has always been fascinated with questions of whether or not artificial intelligence could someday take over and eliminate us, well, EX MACHINA gives us a possible scenario leading up to that day when all hell ultimately breaks loose.",10,7,22,22 March 2015
Pawn Sacrifice," Intense!
","A well-crafted biopic about one of the greatest matches in history. A career-defining performance by Tobey Maguire. Who knew that a movie about a game of chess could be so suspenseful and riveting. You won't be able to take your eyes off of it.Director Ed Zwick is the man who gave us 'Glory,' 'The Last Samurai,' 'Defiance,' basically movies that have epic battlefield sequences, so it's interesting that his battlefield has been scaled down to the size of a chessboard but it's just as colossal, this is a story back in the era when the whole world was watching which of the two ideologies, United States or the Soviets would ultimately win, tension was running high but instead of bullets or nuclear weapons which both regions did have, it all came down to between Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire) and Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber) and even if the movie may or may not want to preach about which is the ultimate victor, it did capture the animosity in the air, so sharp it can cut through glass, the hatred against communism at the time.Written by Steven Knight, who gave us 'Eastern Promises,' and 'Locke,' I think Knight gives in to Hollywood's long-held fascination with brilliance and madness, it's a lot like 'A Beautiful Mind,' where a person is so brilliant that his mind just snaps. Now, I didn't grow up knowing a lot about Bobby Fischer, my dad taught me how to play chess when I was a kid, but I was terrible at it, which is why I turned to soccer. My point is, I don't know how out of touch Fischer really was, and this movie itself is not a straight adaptation, but I think PAWN SACRIFICE accomplishes what it set out to do from the start, this correlation between genius and paranoia or insanity.Mad props to actors Tobey Maguire and Liev Schreiber who, under the direction of Ed Zwick, successfully manage to dramatize the game of chess. Because chess matches are usually silent, so everything heavily relies on the actors' facial expressions, it's all in the eyes and the body language in order to understand the game's intensity. The movie has to also entertain those who may not play chess and so it does, and it's a testament to the amazing performances by Maguire and Schreiber.The movie also brings up a good point that I think would leave the audiences conflicted. Because we would feel like Bobby Fischer would need medical treatment, but a part of us also don't want to hinder or get in the way of brilliance, out of selfish reasons of course, because we would want that brilliance to work in our favor. We badly want to see the master play but at what cost.",9,46,74,14 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The force is strong with this movie!
","This review is spoiler-free meaning it does not contain spoilers, but I will genuinely share with you how 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' affects me as a movie fan, as a Star Wars fan,.. and whether or not it does what it's supposed to do. Audiences around the world tend to agree with the statement that 'Empire Strikes Back' is one of the best sequels ever made, well, I think 'The Last Jedi' can easily take that honor now. This movie is astonishing and spectacular. It pushes many of this franchise's familiar elements to their limits and it really digs deep into the key characters and brings forth everything that stands out about them. Writer/director Rian Johnson is an impeccable storyteller.The story picks up after the events in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens,' by this time the First Order grows stronger as it corners the resistance to an impossible situation. Poe Dameron, Finn and Rose come up with a plan that could work but time is of the essence. Meanwhile Rey is doing her best to convince Luke Skywalker to join in on the fight, but Luke doesn't want to be a jedi or a master, let alone the resistance's final hope.Ok, so if you're wondering what happens with Kylo Ren, Rey, Poe Dameron and Finn and how they affect each other this time around, without giving it away, what 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' does is essentially flesh out these characters. Not only will you get to know some of their history and their background and what truly compels them, but this time they're also facing some very difficult choices. And the film also lays out judgement on some of them, it puts an end to some parts of the story that doesn't need to be continued anymore in the next episode. And what's brilliant about the story that Rian Johnson has crafted is that it makes you the audience think that each of those characters has their own respective path that they're going on, you expect them to see it through but bam, other plans take over but turns out these new unexpected plans actually make sense to the overall arc. Johnson wants these characters' personal journeys to be a refined in the fire type of journeys. Each revelation, each aspect, brings them one step closer to being the lead stars, front and center of this new trilogy as the old icons take a step back further away from the spotlight. Speaking of whom, it's so awesome Mark Hamill be Luke Skywalker again, he has a bigger role this time, such a larger than life legend, and Hamill actually gives his best performance in years in this one.I know that a lot of fans consider 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' to be more or less a rehash of 'A New Hope' and I don't blame them for thinking that because to a certain extent, it was a rehash. But it's a necessary one because after the super boring parliamentary-heavy prequels by George Lucas. So it was important for 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' to remind us that this franchise was once super fun and exciting. So because that problem was taken care of, so now Rian Johnson doesn't need to do such reminder anymore with 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi.' It is not a Empire Strikes Back rehash. Rian can freely do what he does best, similar to what he did with 'Brick,' 'The Brothers Bloom,' and 'Looper, and that is to further explore the possible consequences of the characters' decisions while at the same time amplifying everything you love about Star Wars, it even brings back some familiar faces. If you've always been fascinated with the force, this movie emphasizes the force all the more. If you miss Carrie Fisher, this movie has heavy dose of general Leia, if light speed gets you stoked, there's plenty of those here, and if you're a big fan of jedi mindtrick, boy does 'Star Wars: the Last Jedi' have a big motherload surprise for you or what!Such incredible breathtaking new locations as well, especially that vast salt land in Bolivia that serves as the backdrop for the planet Crait. The battle sequences in this film are pulse-pounding, explosive and intense. The light saber fights are thrilling, you just get enough of it, you'll be begging for more, you'll want the film to display more of those laser swords in action. The way the new characters integrate themselves with the stories of Kylo Ren, Finn and Poe Cameron is quite seamless. Whatever conflicts amongst them or their collision only lead to some of this film's most heroic moments which are highlighted by the remarkable sound mix and sound editing. This is a movie that entirely looks and moves and feels and breathes like a Star Wars movie with an Oscar level deeply affecting drama that stays with you long after the end credits roll. The force is strong with 'Star Wars: the Last Jedi.'-- Rama's Screen --",10,89,291,12 December 2017
Jurassic World," Welcome.. to my REVIEW of 'Jurasic World'
","I'm going to be honest with ya, I didn't think JURASSIC WORLD was going to be this awesome, and I was mostly basing that on how terrible 'Jurassic Park 3' was and how to this day it still leaves a bad impression. But JURASSIC WORLD blew my mind. One of the many reasons is because it truly captures everything, and I mean literally everything that we loved about the first film. The first film will always be a timeless masterpiece, hands down, nothing can ever change that and this JURASSIC WORLD is a sequel, not a reboot, but in many ways, it pays homage to the first one, and because of that, it may leave room for some predictability, because the stories and the themes are more or less similar, but the designs and the executions by director Colin Trevorrow's team, complimented by today's advanced VFX, all of that results in awe-inspiring breathtaking sequences, you can't even look away from some of its intense scary moments because they're such a sight to behold, majestic in every sense of the word. Not only does JURASSIC WORLD revive this franchise, it restores our childhood's passion and love for dinosaurs. As soon as that John Williams' music hits the screen, the minute you hear it, you're immediately taken back to 1993, any additional notes by composer Michael Giacchino are only there in service of that.If you recalled, in the first movie, there's a shot of the T-Rex attacking the kids from up above by pressing down against the glass roof of that iconic 'Jurassic Park' jeep, in this one, there's a similar scene involving a new high-tech multi-terrain vehicle called gyrosphere. In the first one, the kids were separated from the adults, forcing a small search and rescue mission to happen, and the kids were related to John Hammond who owned the place. Something similar also happens in JURASSIC WORLD and the kids are related to Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire, who pretty much runs the place. In the first movie, John Hammond thought he had it all figured out and under control, that nothing could go wrong under his watch, well, multiply that by two, and you have Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire who refuses to believe that there are things in life that she just couldn't handle, it would take a lot for that to finally go through her thick skull. Those are some of the many examples of what I mean by JURASSIC WORLD capturing everything that we loved about the first film. It brings back that excitement and wonder.I remember when the first JURASSIC WORLD preview hit the web, we thought to ourselves, o, man they're making a genetically engineered dinosaurs now?! When will these guys ever learn?! O sheesh, here we go again¬Ö and so we thought that we were in for nothing but a big new dino villain, and that that's all that they were going to throw into the story and that was going to be it, just like the second movie was all about putting T-Rex in San Diego and the third one was about this ugly lookin' spinosaurus and that was it. But nope, JURASSIC WORLD is so much more. Colin and his team made sure that the human characters feel real, that their story feel real, first and foremost, and so then the threat that comes from this new dino villain, Indominus Rex feels even more present. They made sure that this fully functional JURASSIC WORLD theme park looks close to what John Hammond may have envisioned and so much more, that when you witness some of the attractions or the human - dinosaur encounters, it makes you want to go to that place so bad, nothing else matters.Chris Pratt's character, Owen, is such an ultimate badass in this film. If you thought Star-Lord/Peter Quill was cool, get a hold of this guy, Owen, because when the chips are down, he's the guy you'd want to have on your side if you want to live to see tomorrow. And Pratt plays it straight. By the way, about that whole riding with the raptors scene, it's not about taming them, I think the movie depicts these raptors like they're some kind of a pack of big wild wolves, there's some kind of mutual respect between Owen and them, but they could still attack and kill Owen at any time if they want to. And after seeing this film, I've come to the conclusion that it may have been too early and unfair for Joss Whedon to have labeled that one particular scene as sexist, and at times Bryce Dallas Howard's performance can be a bit wooden, but it actually goes along with her character, it speaks about her character, Claire. Psychologists might see Claire as someone who puts up a big wall around herself. I think Bryce does a good job, although you'll crack up at her running around from dinosaurs while wearing high heels. And my goodness, this new big bad Dino villain, Indominus Rex is pretty much the ultimate mutant, she's a mix of a lot of things, which is why she could even think two or three steps ahead of the humans, she's manipulative, she's a schemer, she's a fighter, a hunter, anything in her path will die, she's scary as hell, I-Rex is this year's invincible villain. But the movie has an epic climactic scene that would solve all the problems but you have to sit through the whole thing to see it, and so if you have doubts, if you have concerns, if you have your reservations about JURASSIC WORLD, I don't blame ya, but I invite you to just allow yourselves be entertained by what Colin and his guys have crafted for ya, keep an open mind and I guarantee you're going to have a jurassic fun time at the theaters.",8,2,8,10 June 2015
Silence," The latest temptation of Martin Scorsese
","With regards to Martin Scorsese's SILENCE, let me just put it this way, I saw Scorsese's 1988's 'The Last Temptation Of Christ,' back when I was in college, as you know that film was also an adaptation, and I thought it was pure masterpiece just in terms of its themes because whether or not you'd want to argue that perhaps that some of the approach may have been sacrilegious or religiously inconsiderate, if you will, to me it was about wondering the what if's and whether or not doubt has any footing in order for faith to grow. To a certain extent, SILENCE conveys something similar.Based on Shusaku Endo's novel, SILENCE is about two Jesuit missionaries who travel to Japan because they have heard that their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has publicly denounced God. At the time, Christianity was outlawed in Japan, so in their search for their missing mentor, they endure torture, suffering, and the ultimate test of faith.In a way you could say that SILENCE is Martin Scorsese's way of paying respect to the legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa especially for us fans who grew up watching old time Japan's samurai classics, although SILENCE is not action-driven obviously, but the authoritarian rule depicted in this film is definitely something that's culturally based on that particular era.From technical standpoint, SILENCE is as rich and complex as the story itself, even the violence is done in a graphic yet artistic manner. Because the story is told through Andrew Garfield's Father Rodrigues' perspective, you'll find some of the shots from inside his prison cell, looking out, with the frame being in between the wooden bars, to be quite engrossing. It makes the tension all the more real because your mind just keeps racing, you don't know how much more gruesome it would get. Odd to say this but it sort of becomes a point of anticipation, it's as if every other half-hour or so, you know some Christians are going to get tortured and so you're just bracing for impact. Martin Scorsese's ever-so-reliable high standard quality filmmaking is present through and through, so there's no disappointing you there.After being religious and full of conviction in 'Hacksaw Ridge' as a Seventh-Day Adventist, actor Andrew Garfield becomes religious and full of conviction again, this time in 'Silence' and what's interesting is that both films feature Japanese people. All that aside, this is yet another evidence of Garfield's commitment to his work, the same goes for Adam Driver and Liam Neeson who not only went through physical changes, you actually feel a bit concerned for their health, but that conviction is shown in their eyes. It's amazing to see how this former Spider-Man quickly this powerful force. The Japanese actors are equally outstanding, especially Issey Ogata whose performance has his own flamboyant way of being ruthless.This is Scorsese's long passion project, he had been wanting to do this film for years, but the question remains, and those of you who've watched the film are probably wondering it as well. And my answer is no, I don't think SILENCE means to demonize Buddhism. If this film is Scorsese's way of promoting Christianity, then that is his prerogative. But throughout mankind's history, there had been many cases in many lands where the majority religion, whatever religion that maybe, persecutes the minority religion because they view them as a dangerous threat; a symbol of a potential takeover. Inquisitions have happened everywhere. Which leads me back to what I said earlier about how SILENCE reminds me a lot of 'The Last Temptation Of Christ,' we see men who are supposed to be like rocks, seemingly falter and start to question their faith, but perhaps questioning your faith is one way of reaffirming it. Liam Neeson's character in this film has a counter argument to Andrew Garfield's Rodrigues and he may make a bit of sense if you see it from his version of truth.-- Rama's Screen --",8,90,164,23 December 2016
Logan," A character-driven superhero film done right!
","LOGAN is brutal, merciless and powerful. This is a character-driven superhero movie done right. I would even dare to say it's better than many of the previous X-Men installments and spinoffs. And if this is indeed Hugh Jackman's final Wolverine movie, then my goodness, what a helluva way to go out in a blaze of glory.The story is set in the near future, mutants are thinning out. They've either died or been hunted down. Logan's (Hugh Jackman) healing power is not as strong as it used to be. He's old and weary and taking care of professor X (Patrick Stewart) in a hideout on the Mexican border, accompanied by Caliban (Stephen Merchant). But their attempt to hide from the world gets interrupted when dark forces arrive at their doorstep looking for a certain young little girl.Great move on the studio's and filmmakers' part to have this film be rated R because what we get here is Wolverine unleashed. The violence is as graphic and fully exposed as you can imagine it to be. So just that aspect alone will excite the fanbase who's been wanting to see the destruction that could take place when Wolverine is really really angry. Setting it on the border does allow the film to play with certain tones and color palette reminiscent to 'Breaking Bad' for example, the film's ending however does provide a more vibrant environment as a base for an extremely bloody collision.The writing is solid for a superhero film, it really digs deep into these beloved characters, how vulnerable they are, how they long for a world where people would just leave them be. You truly feel for Xavier and Logan in a way that you never did in the previous X-Men movies, not only because they're now in their twilight years but there's also that father-son type of relationship that's tough love and endearing and then there's also the reluctant father daughter connection Logan has with X-23. By the way, the little girl, Dafne Keen, who plays X-23 is remarkable. So much force, so much energy, so much roar, she's like a cheetah that just runs and slices and dices left and right without prejudice, what an incredible young talent. This is a movie that gives you action to its fullest degree and an emotional journey that's uncompromising. The perfect film about the man who's the best at what he does but what he does isn't very nice.",10,144,299,17 February 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The road to hell is paved with good intentions
","AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is simply amazingWhen it comes to superhero movies such as this, I always try to look beyond whether or not the adaptation is faithful to the material, because the audiences who'll be watching this movie aren't just comic book nerds, but also some of us who may have been a late bloomer or may have been only fans of just the movies, or still would have to wikipedia things to catch up. And I'm glad that writer/director Joss Whedon has that ability to make his 'Avengers' movies engaging and inclusive, like an open door inviting everyone to come in instead of saying 'Well, if you don't know what's up, then tough luck.' If you've seen 2012's blockbuster, 'The Avengers' which showed the rough start of how these individuals tried to work together as a team, well, you'll be glad to know that in the opening sequence of 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' we see them working in harmony as a team, they have a clear plan, everybody's got their job and everybody knows what they're supposed to be doing, Cap is leading, they all have each other's back, the whole sequence is like a well-oiled machine. But because of that, Whedon knows that he has to throw a curve ball, these 'Avengers' movies are about teamwork, and so as a coach, Whedon has to throw in some kind of challenge that would make or break this team, to see if they could grow through obstacles and at first those obstacles come in the form of the twins: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who had a rough background, a rough upbringing, they're motivated by spite and distrust towards others, which is why when Ultron comes along, they share something in common or so they think.In the comics, Ultron, as I understand it, was created by Hank Pym, but in Marvel Cinematic Universe, in this movie, Ultron is created by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) Do you remember the old saying 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions,' that's the theme that Whedon is going with for this sequel. In the name of peace, Stark and Banner create an artificial intelligence that they hope would help them protect earth from any impending threat. But this A.I. blames humanity for everything, for not being able to reach such targeted peace. Refusing to be Stark's puppet, Ultron manufactures himself, regenerates himself, in other words clones himself into an army of killer robots. In 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron,' you'll also get to see tension rising between Cap and Stark, at one point it got so bad, you're like 'Whoah, Whedon, save some for the Russos and their 'Civil War' movie, will ya' but it all boils down to that teamwork again. Taking it upon yourself because you think it's for the greater good VS. talking it out as a team and respecting the collective decision.The movie is way bigger than the first one, not just in terms of scope or locations, because it's more than just one major city in the United States, it has gone global now, and you can just feel it that the battlegrounds would only go even more colossal from this point on, it expands from one place to a few different places and it's eventually going to be about the whole planet and even outer space, I just can't wait for how much more epic it's going to be in 'Avengers: Infinity War' movies. But 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' is also bigger in terms of the cast. Whedon had a daunting task of making sure that each of the characters has their moment in the sun. The film's runtime is no longer than 2012's 'The Avengers' but I think fans will be divided on how they would receive some of the ways Whedon explored the characters in this sequel. The romance between Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Cap vs. Stark, Ultron Vs. Stark, The Vision (Paul Bettany) trying to prove himself worthy of being part of the good guys, the twins and their dilemma, some fans might try to analyze which of those subplots seems forced or balanced and some fans may favor one over the other. But I think fans will be happy to see that Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) gets more story this time around. And I think fans can agree that James Spader as Ultron could not be a more perfect choice. Obviously, this is not the first movie in the history of cinema to introduce a killer robot, but Spader infuses his charisma, his commanding voice, he's so articulate, he can persuade, influence, and convince you, this Ultron makes such a strong case, a strong argument, you can't help but somewhat agree with him to a certain level and I don't think anybody other than Spader could've better delivered that.Is 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' as equally spectacular as 2012's 'The Avengers?' Not quite, but it's still an amazing feat nonetheless. It's got outstanding VFX, really cool cinematic set pieces and awesome cinematography that make this team look and move seamlessly like a work of art. It's a great blend of visual and story. It's action-packed and it's fun. The tone is way darker than the first movie but it's still got tons of that Whedon's sense of humor. If you're invested in the comic books, or if you're invested in only the previous Marvel movies leading up to this, you will all get catered to. 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' is one of this summer's most anticipated movies and it lives up to it.Please read more at Ramascreen.Com",10,32,65,22 April 2015
Everest," Majestic! I had never experience anything like it.
","A movie that's as stunning and as majestic and as spellbinding as mount Everest itself. Even for many of us who've never been to Nepal, just the fact that Everest is the world's highest mountain requires us to respect it from afar. And I think that's what this film by director Baltasar Kormakur has accomplished, it respects the story, it respects the nature and it respects the memories of the lives lost during that tragic 1996 expedition.Baltasar is an Icelandic filmmaker who knows how to shoot a film in such an environment where the weather can be unpredictable and it can go against you at anytime. He didn't want all of this movie to be shot entirely in a studio, this is not entirely visual effects work, they actually went to Nepal and some of the other locations include Val Senales, Italy. It's out there in the elements, outdoors locations that force even the actors themselves to leave their trailer comfort zone behind. And that is evident on screen, it really shows, because every single frame successfully makes us the audience feel like we're there, we feel the danger, as if we're there climbing the mountain, feeling the pain that comes with excruciating cold because human bodies aren't design to survive such temperature. I think the timing of the arrival of this movie could not have been more perfect. If EVEREST was made a decade or fifteen years ago, for example, when filmmaking technology and the cameras weren't as advanced, I'm not sure if it could've given us a movie-watching experience of this quality. This is not a heist thriller ala 1993's 'Cliffhanger,' this is an epic survival drama.Many of us are familiar with Jon Krakauer's book, 'Into Thin Air' since he himself was one of the climbers, but this movie is not an adaptation, because it's also loosely inspired by other accounts, other books about that same expedition, so in a way, what the scribes William Nicholson and also Simon Beauty and filmmaker Baltasar gave us is a reimagining but one that captures the essence and I think that's what the actors themselves aimed to do. Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Jason Clarke, all of them play these real characters that have families, some may have personal issues, and so the backstory or who's waiting for them on the other side of the world serve as an emotional anchor and a driving force. But you only get a glimpse of it, the script doesn't spend too much time in every last one of them, there are too many grounds to cover, so it provides just enough and then brings the attention back to this whole man vs. nature, this ordeal at hand, all over again, just like one of the characters says in the movie, 'The last word belongs to the mountain.' EVEREST movie does make me wonder why anyone would want to climb mount everest, but it's basically the same as asking ourselves why we do certain things, why we choose to attempt to conquer certain goals, whatever they may be, whether it's the need to inspire and be inspired, whether it's trying to escape our problems, whether it's the love of the climb, EVEREST goes to show that that desire could be both prideful and humbling.",10,121,199,6 September 2015
The Artist," A masterpiece! A film for the ages!
","THE ARTIST is beautiful, definitely one of my favorite films this year.  I can watch it again and again. Writer/director Michel Hazanavicius has  crafted a timeless masterpiece, a film that deserves best picture  nomination along with acting nods for Jean Dujardin and B√©r√©nice Bejo.  It's a silent black-and-white film with masterful music accompaniment,  a charming, irresistible story and an excellent production that gives  you the feel of elegance and authenticity..  In the midst of remakes and sequels out there, THE ARTIST stands out as  something unique, original and well-made. Not only is the film silent  black and white but it's also presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, so it  immediately takes you to Hollywoodland era right from the start.  Hazanavicius must've seen hundreds of silent films to get this thing  right because that's what I would do. I haven't watched many in my  lifetime but what always amuses me about silent films is that you'd see  the characters engage in a fairly long dialogue but then the caption  shows up and it only consists of a few words. THE ARTIST goes above and  beyond to stay true to how silent films were done in the early years of  cinema.  The story essentially is about a silent film star named George  Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin, who's rich and famous and is proud  of his accomplishments, he has a big house and a wife he no longer  finds happiness with. He loves the attention, he loves fame, and he's a  natural born charmer. Actor Jean Dujardin as Valentin looks like a  cross between Gene Kelly, Clark Gable, and Douglas Fairbanks. Valentin  meets a girl named Peppy Miller, played by B√©r√©nice Bejo. He helps her  enter the business and she eventually rises her way to stardom. And  then something radical happens, the talkies, films suddenly aren't  silent anymore and audience want to hear their stars talk and Valentine  becomes obsolete. The great depression only worsens the situation,  Valentin loses his fame and fortune, the only thing he still carries  are his four-legged friend and his pride. Peppy closely observes from a  distance, still admires the man who helped her be part of this showbiz.  Jean Dujardin gives a towering performance, it's acting at its purest  form. Even when Valentin is sad, he could always show a bit of smile  here and there. Because it's a silent film, the body language speaks  more volume and Dujardin's physical and facial expressions speak a  thousand words. When he's jolly and comical, he channels a Chaplin-like  personality and when he's sad and frustrated, his Oscar worthy dramatic  side breaks through, what a magnificent performance! B√©r√©nice Bejo is  vibrant, glamorous and a perfect walking replica of 1920s-1930s  starlets Every actor, including John Goodman, involved in this film is  fantastic. Even the dog deserves an applause. There's a couple of  scenes in the film when you're allowed to hear sounds and people  talking, the first scene introduces them as nightmare, the second scene  happens when Valentin fully embraces them. Because you can't hear  dialogue, composer Ludovic Bource's consistent music plays an even  bigger, more imperative and more integral role in the storytelling, the  music is one of the many things that make THE ARTIST a film for the  ages.",10,20,36,23 November 2011
La La Land," Remarkable! One of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year
","'La La Land' has the exuberance of 'West Side Story,' the willpower of 'Dreamgirls' and the pizazz of 'Grease's romance. Writer/director Damien Chazelle who rocked our world with 'Whiplash' a couple of years ago, has done it again. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are a movie match made in musical heaven. I seriously cannot find a single false note with 'La La Land.'The story is about Mia (Emma Stone) who is an aspiring actress, struggling from one audition to the next, her daytime job is working at a coffee shop in a studio lot where she can be near her dream. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a dedicated jazz musician struggling to make ends meet, dreaming of someday running his own jazz club. Mia and Sebastian meet and fall for each other, but they live in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts. Together they continue to explore the joy and pain of pursuing their dreams.Damien Chazelle has found a way to reignite our love for Los Angeles the way 'Rebel Without a Cause' did decades ago, in fact, much of 'La La Land' is more or less of an homage to that James Dean classic. The colors, the look, the design, the tone, even though it's set in present day, the characters could've easily been transported from a golden age era. What an ambitious production, Chazelle's crew even literally reserved a whole freeway just for their opening scene and trust me when I say that that scene must've been worth the traffic because it's absolutely spectacular. The songs, the music, the choreography are flawless, they're on point, they're upbeat, they take you up to cloud nine. And when the rejections roll in and the characters hit rock bottom and Ryan Gosling melodiously sings his 'City Of Stars' song, it's so tender, it becomes your only desired remedy.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone had worked together before on 'Gangster Squad' so you can sense that these two actors feel very comfortable in each other's company. The level of trust between them is evident. It must be like returning to a familiar place. One sequence stands out where they dance at the Griffith Park and they're so in sync, you start to wonder how many takes did it take for them to get that down pat. What's even more impressive is their abilities to play instruments and sing, even if you don't like musical, the minute you watch 'La La Land,' you'll stand up and cheer because the things that Gosling and Stone do will blow your mind. 'La La Land' is original, it's remarkable, it's one of the best experiences I've had in theaters this year. With this film, Chazelle has established himself as one of the greatest storytellers of our time. And the themes hit home. Pursuing your dreams does come with a cost, because it all comes down to whether or not you're willing to give it all you've got. It's so much easier to just play it safe and do regular 9 to 5 job like everybody else. Pursuing your dreams is risky, self-doubt gets to haunt you every step of the way, and failure lurks around the corner. But what's wonderful about 'La La Land' is that it points out the importance of having someone that believes IN you, just like the way Mia and Sebastian believe in each other, the world be damned.-- Rama's Screen --",10,7,12,26 November 2016
Snowden," Riveting! Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an Oscar-worthy performance.
","The great director who's not afraid to tackle matters of war, conspiracy and controversial American political issues, has returned. Only this time, Oliver Stone has upgraded his latest film's look and tone to make it seem more digitally advanced, which is fine because it fits the story of Edward Snowden and we're living in this day and age where every millennial's favorite series happens to be 'Mr. Robot.' SNOWDEN, as you've guessed it, is a thriller about the whistleblower and former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden, played in this film by the talented Joseph Gordon-Levitt. 'Divergent' star, Shailene Woodley plays his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, who stays by his side through his ordeals of working for the government due to his patriotism while at the same time feeling conflicted about how the government runs its methods in the name of national security. This film dramatizes the events that led Snowden to becoming one of the most wanted men in the world.First, I have to give praises to Joseph Gordon-Levitt who I think went above and beyond in not only capturing Edward Snowden's mannerism and the way he speaks but my goodness, Gordon-Levitt's performance in this film is so calculating and precise, you can see his brains constantly work itself out, just by looking at him. And Shailene Woodley gives her most mature performance yet, because this film is more than just about the whole surveillance controversy, it's also about how that negatively affects Snowden & Mills relationship and I think it's fairly handled, both aspects don't take away or diminish each other's importance in the process.When it comes to the film's dramatizing the U.S. and British global surveillance program, I'm sure there'll be questions as to how authentic the portrayal is, as far as the headquarters are concerned, for example, some may see it as a bit too much like a Bond villain's secret lair, but you'll be entertained by some of the visual effects that the film applies to showcase hacking and how one person can connect to another person and to another person and what's most fascinating about it is that there's a programmer watching the whole thing the entire time.So SNOWDEN is essentially part conspiracy thriller, part relationship drama, and to a certain extent, part heist. Overall, I think it's a riveting film that keeps you engaged and more importantly gets you thinking, which I think is the goal of Oliver Stone's movies. Does the film lean one way in that it paints Edward Snowden as a hero? I think so, but not in a way that intentionally judges those who at the end still think of him as a traitor. SNOWDEN might cause audiences to become more paranoid or it might cause audiences to start supporting any effort to hold our government accountable. The jury's still out.-- Rama's Screen --",8,199,239,11 September 2016
Woman in Gold," Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds on an art crusade.
","A WWII true story drama that deserves to be told on the screen. Helen Mirren gives yet another astounding performance and I was pleasantly surprised by Ryan Reynolds. What would attract audiences to WOMAN IN GOLD is its David Vs. Goliath story, everybody loves a story about an underdog taking on the impossible and that's what WOMAN IN GOLD essentially is.Directed by Simon Curtis who gave us 'My Week With Marilyn' four years ago, Helen Mirren plays an elderly Jewish woman named Maria Altmann who sixty years after she fled Vienna, Austria to escape the Nazis, starts her uphill legal battles to retrieve a valuable painting that was seized by the Nazis, a painting that is now in the possession of a museum in Austria. A young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) helps Maria in her quest that receives resistance from the Austrian establishment. All the while her quest forces Maria to finally confront her past WWII provides a ton of stories for cinemas to depict, they will never run out of WWII materials, this one tackles the fact that thousands of artwork and paintings, that were stolen by Nazis, to this day, have never been restored to their rightful owners. Maria's story is just one of the thousands, and I think it's fascinating that WOMAN IN GOLD basically says that yes, sometimes we need to leave the past where it belongs, the past, but when the past committed a great deal of injustice on us, one can't just easily dismiss it and simply use 'the past' as an excuse to not pursue justice. It's obvious too from Helen Mirren's performance, Helen understands that Maria carries a certain guilt all these years, guilt that she blames herself for abandoning her family and abandoning their possessions. Mirren is excellent at presenting us this tortured conflicted soul, caught between being haunted by the past and the desperate need to forget and move on. And Ryan Reynolds holds his ground as the young persistent lawyer. I think people don't give Ryan enough credit because he's a heartthrob, but the man can pass as a struggling family man with strong conviction. I think WOMAN IN GOLD is an important film, unfortunately I doubt that it would be remembered during award season mainly because we're still fresh from another Weinstein Company's drama, 'Philomena' a couple of years ago which also showed an elderly woman accompanied by a young lad, both on a crusade for the truth.Read more at Ramascreen.Com",7,44,62,29 March 2015
Don't Breathe," Absolutely terrifying
","Screen Gems' new horror film, #DontBreathe is terrifying and unpredictable. The suspense never lets go from start to finish. Well-crafted, with twists and turns around every corner, it's one of the scariest films you'll see this year.Starring Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto and Stephen Lang, scripted by Rodo Savagues and Fede Alvarez who also directed this film, the story is about three best friends who've been breaking and entering and robbing several houses, and they want to get to the biggest score so they can finally get away from their broken lives. That biggest score is a house belonging to a blind man, it's supposed to be an easy job, right? Well, the blind man's got some tricks up his sleeves, turns out, he is not somebody you'd want to mess with.Personally, I was surprised by how good this film is because I was not a fan of Fede Alvarez's 'Evil Dead' remake a few years back which was more concerned about being gory than being scary. But DON'T BREATHE will have you tense the entire time just like the characters themselves because it's filled with moments of silence and surprises. It's basically a cat-and-mouse chase game inside a locked and barricaded house. The ones getting chased don't know their way around the house, obviously, and the one doing the chasing, even though he's blind, let's just say that because of his background, he comes with a particular set of skills. And on top of that, there's a deep dark secret that adds to the layers and makes the characters' survival mode go to the extreme level. This is a very well-staged, well-crafted film that successfully banks on the audiences' not knowing what's going to happen in every single scene.-- Rama's Screen --",10,19,42,24 August 2016
Sicario," One of this year's best thrillers
","More visceral than Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic.' SICARIO is about the cost to pay in a drug war and its merciless brutality. Masterfully shot, perfectly acted. This is a film that doesn't allow you to feel comfortable. With each passing moment, it crawls its way deeper and deeper into this world where death is its only end game.Director Denis Villenuve reteams with master cinematographer Roger Deakins to take advantage of the desert, the weather, the landscape, the terrain, and use them as silent supporting characters that also serve to express the characters' inner demons. Deakins is a multiple Oscar-nominated DP that gets better with every work and in SICARIO, you will see that he once again experiments with even richer and newer ways of shooting, whether it's the night vision first person view or the angles to capture the intensity at the border, moments before weapons are drawn, it's like enrolling in another classroom taught by Deakins but with extra curriculums to learn. The man just knows how to leave his competition behind.To me, what I think is impressive about Emily Blunt is that she is beauty and strength all in one. She can express torment and conflicted soul so effortlessly, she plays this FBI agent, Kate Macer who does things by the book, she always holds herself and others accountable for every detail, so when she volunteers to be a part of a black ops that practically throws the book out the window, her idealistic views are put to the test. And I think Emily Blunt does a nice job of executing that. It's somewhat of a fish out of water story where Blunt's Kate Macer knows she's being used but she wants to know what she's being used for. Oscar winner, Benicio Del Toro has walked through this territory before in Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic' where he played a Tijuana police officer. In SICARIO, he plays a mysterious character, Alejandro, he's skilled, a man of a few words, soft spoken, but highly intense and has a sharp instinct. What has always been brilliant about Del Toro, in all of his works including SICARIO, is that he can say much without actually saying much at all. In the case of his character, Alejandro, there's a certain dark pain that's magnetic about him. It's all in the eyes. Oscar nominee Josh Brolin plays the leader of the team, Matt Graver, he talks way too damn much but that is also a part of his game, his game of manipulating others.I've never been to Juarez, I've heard horrible stories about that place, and SICARIO, though it wasn't exactly filmed in Juarez, does manage to put the fear of God in audiences' heart by showing Juarez for what it is, there's no sugar coating, there's no hiding that it's one of the murder capitals of the world. It's a deeply harrowing part that will stay with you long after you've done watching the film which in and of itself wrestles with questions of morality.SICARIO means 'hit-man,' you'll come to wonder which of those three lead characters is the actual hit-man but ultimately, what SICARIO gives you is this dilemma,... if somebody could finally solve the drug cartel and drug kingpin problems for the rest of us, would you really care that they did it by killing instead of bringing the perp to justice?",10,295,411,17 September 2015
"McFarland, USA"," McFarland USA is awe-inspiring
","Don't quickly diss and dismiss this as just another sports movie, because it's not just another sports movie and to be frank, if it weren't for Disney, unbelievable true stories like this wouldn't have been told in such medium that can reach a lot of people. McFARLAND is awe-inspiring, it'll get you to stand on your feet and cheer for what it means to live in this great nation of ours.Kevin Costner is a reliable name, a dependable actor when it comes to movies that have sports as their set or background, but if you think about it, what makes Kevin Costner's many so-called sports movies in the past excellent was that they were always more than just about the sports and McFARLAND USA is another example of that. Under the direction of Niki Caro, who gave us 'Whale Rider' and 'North Country', Costner gives his best performance yet as coach Jim White who after an incident, finds himself having to move his family to the only job at the only school that would hire him, but they have to make things work in a town where the majority is hispanic Americans. Not being used to the neighborhood, Jim has his doubts and at first isn't inspired to do anything more than his day-to-day usual, but then he notices that the students in that McFarland high school have a unique potential, they may not be good at football or any other sports, but they could run. So Jim White forms a cross country team for them, but Jim's lack of knowledge or lack of understanding of the sport gets them to a very rough start. So Jim and his students have to learn as they goBut Jim has another obstacle, most of the students in his cross country team, have to work early in the morning to help their family, and that serves a big challenge if they plan on winning State Championship.I think McFARLAND USA is a beautifully crafted film that aims to inspire and does its job well, its cinematic feel, its speeches, its structures, it has everything you'd expect in a sports movie that can motivate you to do great things in life, but it's also unique in that this is the first time, possibly as I could remember it, a sports movie that covers this ethnicity and I mean that in a good way, in our current state of our nation today where there has been racial tension going on, suspicions and violence over turfs and ethnicities, there couldn't be a better time for McFARLAND USA to arrive and educate our young minds about tolerance, about celebrating differences, about respecting everybody no matter what background they come from. This is a movie that's as well-made as it is also good-hearted.When you think about America, you shouldn't think about Donald Trump or any other privileged folks who receive investments handed down to them. When you think about America, you should think of folks like the kids in this movie, McFARLAND USA, because in America, you can go from having to pick plants to becoming a state champion, in America, if you work hard, have a clear goal and set your mind to it, you can achieve anything.-- Ramascreen.com --",9,6,22,20 February 2015
The Witch," If you're a true horror fan, you have got to watch THE WITCH
","A cinematic achievement in horror. THE WITCH is superbly crafted. Writer/director Robert Eggers has given us the perfect blend of psychological and supernatural thrill that will terrify you to your core. You'll never stop talking about THE WITCH long after it's done.A family in 1630s New England was banished from their settlement, and so the couple and their five children are out living in the wilderness, struggling to survive. Faith is the only thing that keeps them together. But their newborn son mysteriously vanishes and their crops fail, and the family begins to turn on one another, as they are torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.What's brilliant about THE WITCH, on top of its excellent attempt on trying to be accurate to the period it portrays, is that it's very different from any of the other horror movies we get out there. No jump scares, no cheap gimmicks, no pointless plot. Everything is built up to lead you to creepy and unnerving discomfort and much of it also reminds me of dark paranoia thrillers of the '70s, where there are plenty of suspicions and blame to go around. Writer/director Robert Eggers successfully messes with his characters' and the audiences' minds. In addition to that, great choice on using the olde English mixed with excellent costume design and chilling cinematography, and young talent Anya Taylor-Joy is a revelation, THE WITCH gives a unique and refreshing take on this genre. It's frightening, it's terrifying, full of twists and turns you don't see coming a mile away.",10,6,13,18 February 2016
Pitch Perfect 2," They're back, Pitches! And they're still awesome!!!
","They're back, pitches! The Barden Bellas, the Treblemakers, even that Cups song is back, if you're a huge fan of the first film, like I am, then you're going to have a blast with PITCH PERFECT 2, because it's just as fun, just as exciting, just as hilarious and those covered songs and their renditions are just as catchy, you can't help but like this movie. And I didn't know Oscar nominee Hailee Steinfeld could rock a tune, but she'll definitely leave you impressed.I had my concerns at first, I thought that if the story would only be about the Bellas entering a world tournament and nothing more to it, then we would be in for a shallow unappealing sequel, but writer Kay Cannon and first time feature director Elizabeth Banks put the Bellas back in a place where they would have to relearn, regroup and find the sound again. What makes these 'Pitch Perfect' movies loved by millions is that it's about this group of misfit girls working together as an underdog team. In this case, the goliath, the drago, if you will, is a German team called Das Sound Machine, they know their stuff, they seem to be perfect in both their physique and their choreography, and they're intimidating.The sequel does its best to explore some of the key characters a bit further this time around. It explores the somewhat awkward romances between Bumper and Fat Amy, and between Benji and Hailee Steinfeld's character, Emily. And the Bellas have to also come to terms with the harsh reality that they're now seniors, it's time to not be afraid to move on and give the baton to the next generation. Which is why I can see how this franchise could go on forever, and I don't think you and I would mind at all if Universal Pictures made PITCH PERFECT 23, for example. Even the Bellas' fearless leader, Beca (Anna Kendrick) is distracted because she's trying to balance her commitment to her team and her new intern gig and her dream of becoming a music producer.I gotta give mad respect to Elizabeth Banks for taking this on as her first feature directorial debut. She produced and championed the first 'Pitch Perfect', she's one of the folks who fought to make the first film happen. And now, with this she's proved herself to be as talented a leader as she is an actress. PITCH PERFECT 2 really makes me look forward to many more great movies made by director Elizabeth Banks. And if you've come to theaters hoping to once again be laughing your ass off at whatever Rebel Wilson's Fat Amy does, o, you are in for a treat, my friend. One of the funniest women alive will not disappoint you. The things she says, she even gets to sing solo in this one, Rebel's got tricks up her sleeves, you will crack up, I guarantee it.One of the many things that I like about this movie is its theme of mentorship. It's a scary thought to turn the page and enter the next chapter of your life. The pressure is heavy. Whether it be being a freshman at the same college that your parent went to or finding yourself having to do a job you don't like just to get to that one job you really want. Sometimes we think we can handle everything on our own but fact of the matter is, we will have to ask someone for advice and then we'll have to turn that advice into action, finding the right mentor is important and being a mentor to someone is equally important. So I'm glad that PITCH PERFECT 2 is not just about throwing the Bellas in a world competition, although it is fun to see a cappella groups from other countries, and see their different ethnic costumes and the songs they cover as well. But that world competition in Copenhagen is just a small part of this film. I think you're going to like the big chunk of it, and just like how you've watched the first 'Pitch Perfect' film a thousand times over, I know I have, you're going to do the same to PITCH PERFECT 2 Read more at Ramascreen.Com",9,31,56,14 May 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Baffling!
","For every part of HAIL CAESAR that's attractive and entertaining, there's an equal part that will leave you baffled. Don't get me wrong, I'm speaking as a fan of the Coen Bros' brand of comedy ('O Brother Where Art Thou,' 'Intolerable Cruelty,' 'Burn After Reading') but I just don't think HAIL CAESAR's oddity would resonate with audiences.Starring Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Alden Ehrenreich, Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Scarlett Johansson, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Channing Tatum, Hail, Caesar! follows a single day in the life of a studio fixer who is presented with plenty of problems to fix.At times HAIL CAESAR can be a quite goofy, it's more or less a nod to the golden age of Hollywood, those old movies that would have the characters suddenly bust out in song and dancing, Channing Tatum gives a scene-stealing performance in this department with his little sailor number, it's definitely the scene that audiences would mostly talk about after the end credits roll.George Clooney plays the biggest star in Hollywood who gets kidnapped by a group of writers that happen to carry a certain ideology of their own, so HAIL CAESAR somewhat also pokes fun at that whole communist witch-hunt back in the day even prior to Trumbo era. Josh Brolin plays a studio fixer that has a lot on his plate, juggling frustrated directors and arrogant stars and untalented actors, and now he has to also deal with this kidnapping. But if there's one thing that Coen Bros' comedies have in common is that without the lead character having to try too hard, everything seems to work itself out in the end.Yes you'll laugh, there's no doubt you'll have a bit of fun watching HAIL CAESAR especially with the characters buying so much into their buffoonery because almost all of them think that they're all that, their ego is wildly amusing, and Josh Brolin's character, the studio fixer, is no different. Co-star Tilda Swinton is also another one that's going to crack you up even though her face is not on this film's poster. Great costumes and marvelous production design that take you back to the enchanting days of Fred Astaire and Ginger Ross. HAIL CAESAR also gives you pause to wonder if Hollywood, in many ways, is still as controlling as they were in the golden age. But I think what the Coen Bros' are trying to really convey, what they're really trying to satirize often gets lost in the film's attractive choreography. So yes, you will laugh, but you'll also be massively confused.",5,5,7,3 February 2016
12 Strong," Hardcore Battle Scenes
","12 STRONG has some of the most hardcore battle scenes in any war movie. It's soldiers carrying weapons while riding horses, that definitely makes this one unique. And if you're animal lovers, you are right to be concerned about the horses' safety, I'm sure the production went above and beyond to ensure that but to me what's more impressive is the fact that these guys actually storm into battle like that, with bullets flying everywhere, riding a horse isn't exactly taking a cover, it's very very vulnerable, you're out in the open, impressive stuff.Starring Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Pena and Trevante Rhodes, directed by Nicolai Fuglsig, based on Doug Stanton's book, 12 STRONG is the true story of a U.S. Special forces team led by their new captain, Mitch Nelson, played by Chris Hemsworth, and after 9/11 they're sent to be the first troops into Afghanistan to retaliate. There they form alliance with a local general, played by Navid Negahban in order to fight their common enemy, the Taliban. The special forces team has to adapt to the terrain and some of the tactics there which means they have to use Afghani horses to go places. They're outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy who's driven by ideology. Without sounding too shallow, to be honest with you, the biggest reason why I enjoy 12 STRONG is that it's essentially about good guys kicking bad guys' ass. The war in Afghanistan is one of the longest wars in our country's history with no end in sight, it's still going, it's still happening, so seeing it from today's perspective is quite depressing. But something like this, where the characters are charged up because of 9/11, they go in, guns blazing, sending hell to enemy's territory, they go in they get the job done, boom, it definitely satisfies those of us moviegoers who like watching bad guys getting what's coming to them. And I'm glad that the movie is rated R and doesn't hold back, so what you get is a depiction that's not watered down. It's graphic, it's intense, it's brutal, it's in your face. And like I said earlier, the battle scenes are explosive and hardcore. You're really engaged the entire time. It's well staged, well choreographed and well-shot, with some excellent sound mix and sound editing work. There's a bit of drama they throw in there with the clash between how Chris Hemsworth's character does things versus how the local general Navid Negahban's character does things, so even though the bad guy is quite one dimensional, there's plenty to go around between those two commanding characters. The movie does a good job of emphasizing the reason why a group like the Taliban needs to be eliminated, it does a good job of pumping us up to keep rooting for the good guys to win. What a helluva film to honor those courageous horse soldiers. -- Rama's Screen --",8,120,246,17 January 2018
Finding Dory," It goes straight for the heart
","How do you top a masterpiece like 'Finding Nemo' which by the way won Oscar for best animated feature of the year more than a decade ago? How do you follow after that is exactly the million dollar question with FINDING DORY and although this sequel doesn't reach the same level of greatness, it holds its own just fine. Pixar's eternal reliance on a well-told story is why FINDING DORY goes straight for the heart.All is well from the events in 'Finding Nemo,' every character seems happy doing their usual routine. Until something triggers Dory's (Ellen DeGeneres) memory which is quite rare since as you all know, and as she keeps reminding us, she suffers from short term memory loss. She remembers she had a mom and a dad. With the help of Nemo (Hayden Rolence) and Marlin (Albert Brooks) the trio once again go off on another adventure to find Dory's parents. But of course, they don't have a solid plan and they only rely on Dory's bits and pieces of memory to guide them, so this across the ocean adventure leads them to California's Marine Life Institute where Dory finds help in an octopus named Hank (Ed O'Neill) a beluga (Ty Burrell) and a whale shark (Kaitlin Olson) If 'Finding Nemo' has part of its story set in the ocean and the other set in a small aquarium tank in a dentist office, FINDING DORY is partly set in the ocean but mostly set out of the water, on land and in a giant rehabilitation aquarium center kinda like the one up at Monterey Bay. So the scope this time around is a lot bigger, and I'm sure that presents its own set of challenges for director Andrew Stanton and his fellow animators. But luckily the film doesn't suffer from what usually befalls other sequels which is the difficulty of recapturing that magic once it's already out of the bottle, thankfully that doesn't happen here because FINDING DORY doesn't worry too much about giving winks and nods to the first film, it can stand on its own, and aside from Marlin, Dory, and Nemo, the film also features a ton of new characters that play into a whole new round of camaraderie.Does it matter for Dory to remember and find her parents? In other words, is this sequel necessary? Perhaps, and perhaps not. The first movie already ended with happily-ever-after anyway and that's what it seems to be happening at the beginning of FINDING DORY as well, but going back home and reuniting with your loved ones have always been the reason why this franchise is dearly loved by many. And another thing that stands out is that not one, not two, but more than a few of the new characters in this film have shortcomings or flaws. The beluga doesn't think his sonar skills could work, the whale shark is nearsighted, the octopus only has seven tentacles, and even a certain bird helping Marlin and Nemo is a bit unstable. But that's the beauty of FINDING DORY because it showcases the strengths from the characters that others would quickly dismiss or not deem as normal. Dory, who suffers from memory loss, is at home in this film surrounded by characters who feel for and understand exactly what she's going through in terms of their flaws. And I think that's a great lesson for children everywhere to not look for perfection but to do the best they can with what they've been given. FINDING DORY may not be the masterpiece that 'Finding Nemo' was, and the third act may seem a bit too outrageous for some, but overall it's still a funny, heartwarming, and exciting adventure movie that the entire family can enjoy.-- Rama's Screen --",10,3,22,16 June 2016
Arrival," Extraordinary! It's this generation's 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind'
","ARRIVAL is this generation's 'Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.' The great new meaningful sci-fi that dares to ask some of the most existential questions of our time. Amy Adams gives an emotionally brilliant performance. Through a well- written story that captures your imagination, ARRIVAL is both breathtaking and profound.What I love about ARRIVAL among many reasons, is that yes, this movie has big visual effects and set pieces, but I think this is the one sci-fi movie where yes the concept is intriguing, it has both your curiosity and attention, but the meaning behind it and the themes are way more affecting. It's an extremely thought- provoking film that you and your friends would discuss for days after you've screened it. And the visuals do just about enough to wow you, the approach is so delicate, so precise as to elevate the emotional journey of Amy Adams' character.A bold script, and an even bolder directing, with Johann Johannsson's celestial music and Bradford Young's beautiful cinematography, much of ARRIVAL also kinda looks and feels like if Terrence Malick made an alien invasion drama. One of the greatest actresses in the history of cinema, Amy Adams, proves once again that she can carry a movie with such magnitude, she's like a battleship that shoots torpedo at enemies in its path and she nails every last one of them. It feels like a privilege watching Amy do her thing in ARRIVAL because you're witnessing perfection at work. The film deals with two big themes, the importance of communication and understanding AND the idea of embracing the inevitable given the opportunity to change it, I love stories like this that end up making you reflect on your life's decisions. What an extraordinary film!-- Rama's Screen --",10,3,15,8 November 2016
Wonder Woman," This is Wonder Woman in all her glory
","#WonderWoman movie is simply amazing. It doesn't hold back, it pulls out all the stops, it doesn't reserve some parts for a potential sequel, it fully gives you this iconic Amazonian Warrior princess in all her glory. You'll be constantly blown away by what she can do because the film is constantly eager to show them to you. Gal Gadot has cemented her star power and the DC Cinematic Universe has redeemed themselves through 'Wonder Woman.'Starring Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen, David Thewlis, directed by Patty Jenkins, before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons trained to be an unconquerable warrior in the mythical island of Themyscira. But Diana is unaware of her true identity. When an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive war raging in the outside world, Diana feels compelled to join him and fight alongside mankind to stop the threat and kill who she blames to be the cause of such destruction, the god of war Ares.Because it's a DC movie, much of the visual and the style of 'Wonder Woman' is what you'd expect from a DC movie. But what's great about this one, which by the way the other installments unfortunately failed to do, is that 'Wonder Woman' manages to inject entertainment, so it's not all brooding and dark and depressing like the way they've turned boyscout Superman into.And I think much of that is thanks to the fish-out-of-water aspect. This is a woman who comes from a place which has a significantly different culture than ours. And halfway through the end, the fish-out-of-water aspect becomes less about literally not fitting in and more about her misunderstood perception of us, mankind. So perhaps 'Wonder Woman' is an example of a success story that happens when you don't give all the control to Zack Snyder and when studio heads don't meddle with the mythology and the filmmaker's vision and when things are not forced or rushed. The result is a story which you can tell has been given a considerable amount of thought process.Any doubt anybody may have had about Gal Gadot playing this role will fade away the minute she steps into the screen. Not only does she look the part, she's absolutely gorgeous, her acting is sharp, she also performs the action sequences with strength and elegance. She becomes Wonder Woman, they are now inseparable, just like we're all going to have a hard time imagining somebody else other than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan. This is Wonder Woman's debut on the big screen, billions of girls and women on earth look up to her as their hero, they have been anticipating this moment for years, so it is a huge responsibility, one that I think Gadot gracefully carries. Kudos to WB and DC Entertainment for entrusting this to female filmmaker Patty Jenkins who does an excellent job because more than just it being a great superhero film, 'Wonder Woman' is a very well-made film. It's spectacular in every sense of the word.-- Rama's Screen --",10,43,92,31 May 2017
The Woman in Black," Harry Potter meets Ghost
","-- www.Ramascreen.com --THE WOMAN IN BLACK is a mildly entertaining horror film that rides heavily on the popularity of Daniel Radcliff. It's going to make a lot of money at the box office, not because it's attended by genuine horror fans but because it's attended by Harry Potter fans. But that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing. Some aspects about THE WOMAN IN BLACK does work, it has enough fright to keep you alert. But the concept is nothing new and the ending is too convenient¬ÖBased on an '80s book, by Susan Hill, that was previously turned into a TV movie but this is the first time that it hit the big screen. And with the help from revamped Hammer Productions, which gave birth to a lot of classic Brit horror films, and screenwriter Jane Goldman whose contributions to X-Men: First Class and Kick-Ass I admired, THE WOMAN IN BLACK becomes a feature length horror film that lurks in the dark and frequently jolts you to your core. The film unfortunately suffers from unintentional humorous situations. Scenes that are supposed to be scary becomes slightly comical and scenes that are supposed to be dramatic becomes tacky for lack of a better word.I enjoy the environment in which the story is set. It's gloomy, often foggy as well, and it features a massive landscape that could drown whenever the tide rises. The film has all the elements needed to tell an effective horror story, a creepy empty mansion, a vengeful, murderous spirit, a protagonist conflicted, and I think director James Watkins did a splendid job of maintaining the unpleasant, uncomfortable tone. The only problem is there are too many mcguffins that come into play. The film is obsessed with certain things way too often. I'm OK with horror films that give ghosts personalities and agendas but the lead ghost in this story is too erratic for my taste.I know what you're wondering. So how did Radcliffe do in this film? I've gotta be honest with you, Radcliffe playing a father to a son is as unconvincing as Anton Yelchin with facial hair acting like an seasoned man in Like Crazy. It's as hilarious as watching Radcliffe played an older Potter at the end of Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2. I just don't buy it. I understand that Radcliffe wants to move on and show the world that he can do more than just casting spells and waving wands, but I don't think he gives the audience enough time to be ready to see him in an adult role. Performance-wise, I think he plays Arthur Kipps with a certain composure, he knows his character is conflicted, part of him just wants to get the job done and return to his son, but part of him wants to believe in the supernatural because he misses his dead wife, which probably lead Goldman to writing an ending that gives you a reunion as the ghost's way of saying thanks. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is in a sense a very traditional ghost story because there's an unfinished business involved and the longing for reunion with restful peace. It doesn't leave much for further interpretation but if you love a good scare, THE WOMAN IN BLACK does the trick.-- www.Ramascreen.com --",6,9,21,2 February 2012
The Greatest Showman," Ending the year on a high note
","O, my god! I knew I was a sucker for musicals but The Greatest Showman just exceeds all my expectations. The songs are catchy, the dance numbers are hypnotic, all the performers look and sound fantastic, and they're all such great singers. None of them fumbles, none of them sound dreadful like Russell Crowe in Les Miserables because almost all of the ensemble in The Greatest Showman can carry a tune. The story is a bit basic but that's ok, it was always designed to be a feel-good movie that's triumphant, extravagant and joyous.Written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and directed by Michael Gracey, Hugh Jackman plays P.T. Barnum who came from nothing and marries the love of his life, Charity, played by Michelle Williams. Charity comes from a privileged family, while P.T. Barnum grew up poor. So now comes a chance where P.T. can finally prove that he's more than just some dirt kid from the street, he opens up a circus spectacle that became a big sensation but his ambitions and his desperate need for approval makes him unable to see the joy and happiness that are already there right in front of him.First of all, what you need to know is that this is not a straight up biopic of the actual P.T. Barnum because the actual P.T. Barnum had his controversies. So what THE GREATEST SHOWMAN basically does is take the character P.T. Barnum and put a spin on his story, including his touring with opera singer, Jenny Lind. Zac Efron and Zendaya's roles are that of a young love but their subplot also ties nicely with the drama of Hugh Jackman and Michelle William's characters. And I freakin 'love all the songs featured in this film, I have the soundtrack by the way and I kept listening to it for hours on end, put them on repeat and listen to them again the next day. So addictive. Written by the same songwriting team behind 'La La Land' but I must say that 'The Greatest Showman' songs are way better, they stay in your head for days. Kudos on the dance choreographies too, everything about this film's music is so in sync harmoniously, the songs match what is going on at that moment in the story, they compliment the characters' emotions. Another thing that you need to know is that even though the story is set in the '1800s, the music is not meant to sound like it comes from that era, the style is more contemporary or hip-hop, it's meant to give you that grand majestic impression, more like Las Vegas rather than Broadway, if that comparison helps.This of course is not Hugh Jackman's first rodeo in the world of musical, Zac Efron and Zendaya are talented in that department too, so what you have here is a group of talents that are highly skilled at dazzling you with their moves and vocal chords, it helps that easy on the eyes as well. Jackman in particular has that bravado presence about him. But don't be mistaken, this is not some Oscar worthy achievement ala Les Miserables, although.. if it does get nominated, it deserves to be recognized for at least the costumes and the production design, but THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is all about entertaining you with bright colors and it's all about making your foot tap while at the same time celebrating entrepreneurial spirit and celebrating diversity which are something I can definitely relate to. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is charming, it's uplifting, it makes you smile, it's a great way to end the year on a high note.-- Rama's Screen --",10,28,67,20 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back'
","There has been an awakening and it is awesome! No offense to those Ewoks, but STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is the best 'Star Wars' movie since 'The Empire Strikes Back.' This film is exciting, it's fun, but it's also heart-wrenching and deeply affecting. Clearly the result of a work done with care.Now this a spoiler-free review, I'm going to keep it that way because this film does have a pivotal plot point that if you spoil it, it would certainly ruin the entire experience. So the secret must be kept until you see it for yourself, it is that crucial.The story is set years after the events in 'Return Of The Jedi,' Leia is now a general leading the resistance, and Luke Skywalker has gone missing, the mystery of his whereabouts is constant throughout the film, it is what drives the good guys and the first order, finding Luke becomes their cause. Oscar Isaac plays a great pilot named Poe Dameron who gets captured by the villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But a stormtrooper with a conscience, Finn (John Boyega) helps Finn escape, a situation which then leads to Finn encountering Rey, (Daisy Ridley) a scavenger who's just trying to get by and survive each day. A new adorable droid, BB8, enters their lives and gives them a mission which leads them to Millennium Falcon and Han Solo. These young ones learn about the past, that the jedi and the force are all real. Meanwhile a threat far more sinister and much larger than the death star is wreaking havoc. These new characters will ultimately have to choose whether to stay as who they are or become something more.What's awesome about STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is that J.J. brought back everything we loved about the old original 'Star Wars' films. He brought back all the fun and excitement that the prequels lacked because those episodes I,II, and III were too busy trying too hard to be political thrillers. J.J. brought back the Millennium falcon and the thrill of aerial fight. Even the light saber fights on the ground are extremely well-choreographed, they keep you on the edge of your seat.I think the new kids on the block, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Ridley, all did a fantastic job, and they can go toe-to-toe with the legends, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Luke Skywalker. I think the writers, J.J. Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt smartly written the film in a way that would bridge the gap between these two generations. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is nostalgic for us who've been fans ever since we could remember, but it embraces new fans who may not know much but will now learn more because of this film. It's a great way to pass the baton, it also makes way for the next installment, EPISODE VIII and IX.This is a very well thought-out film, not a single boring note, nothing about it seems hasty or abrupt, it's well-structured and well-crafted from start to finish. I love how Rey and Finn start out not having a purpose but they end up choosing their own, this is not about destiny placed upon you, it's still up to them in the end, just like how it's my choice to plan on watching this film again and again until I memorize every single line and dialogue.You geek out when you see something familiar, you geek out when you see something new, you laugh, you cry, you can feel your pulse pounding through the action sequences, STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is why you go to the theaters. Any of us who had doubts when Disney bought Lucasfilm can now admit that that may have actually been a pretty smart move on their part, definitely a good thing that happened to this property.",10,19,57,16 December 2015
Deadpool," Hell yeah!
","In a world.. where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty, #Deadpool comes along and shows you how it's done! It's the perfect combo of action, comedy, and R-rating that really don't give two sh*ts about your sensitivity. Do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl you've been crushing on during chemistry class in high school? Well, you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for DEADPOOL.Ryan Reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary Wade Wilson, Morena Baccarin plays his hot-ass girlfriend, Vanessa. This woman is the embodiment of sexy. They are a match made in Marvel Comics' heaven. But their dream is crushed upon discovering that Wilson has cancer all over, a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers. The lab is run by Francis/Ajax (Ed Skrein) who himself is a bit of a mutant. The brutal experiments turn Wade Wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one. He's now bent on revenge, especially after Ajax kidnaps Vanessa. Meanwhile Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead from the X-Men, try their best to convince Deadpool to join their team and become one of the good guys. But let's face it, that ain't DEADPOOL's style! The first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writers/creators Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other. The next people in line to thank are screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick who remind us why we loved 'Zombieland' back in 2009, they inject the same brand of humor into DEADPOOL and keep the character faithful to the comic books, yes, by that I mean none of that crap version of Wade Wilson in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' anymore! Applause goes to Tim Miller as well, what a helluva feature directorial debut, clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out, if you just let him run with it, it's like giving G.I. Joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart, great things can happen.For those of you who are not familiar with DEADPOOL, just a heads up, this movie, just like the comics, is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex, violence and humor, and that's exactly how we like it. Wade Wilson is a chatterbox, he talks a lot, to some this can get annoying, while to the rest, it's music to our ears, mainly because of the sh*t he says. And he breaks fourth wall, meaning he'll talk to you the audience. But what's even more epic than that is the fact that he is AWARE of the universe that he's in and the universe that you're in, and those two collide in the most epic way possible, so Ryan Reynolds' character, Wade Wilson, makes fun of Ryan Reynolds the actor and also mocks Ryan Reynolds' previous poor decisions like Green Lantern and People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive This movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans, it even has what I think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema. For a while, I heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants, but I'm glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment a.k.a origin story, so it's simple enough for the new fans to follow. I love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic, it's like insult comedy or one of them roast shows, everybody is fair game. The fights are rock 'em sock 'em and the VFX is impressive! And I can't be happier for Ryan Reynolds, I'm sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since 'Green Lantern' and whatever the hell that was in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine,' so with this DEADPOOL movie, he finally got it right, you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre, and so now he's really part of the gang. He was born for this role. He was destined to play this. In many ways, Deadpool is kinda like Van Wilder on crack. And actress Morena Baccarin as Vanessa¬Ö well, let's just say that after watching this movie, every guy on earth will wonder, 'Why can't my girlfriend be more like that!' If you're looking for a date movie, DEADPOOL is it. if you're looking for an action-packed movie, DEADPOOL is definitely most certainly it.",10,128,253,7 February 2016
Joy," It's about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward
","Writer/director David O. Russell continues his hot streak of great movies with his latest, 'Joy' that takes the concepts of 'Believe In Yourself' and 'Never Give Up' out into the back yard, beat them down, half dead, till they can finally fight back. It's an emotional roller coaster ride that only Russell's go- to girl, Jennifer Lawrence can deliver and she did, and anybody who's ever had doubts about Lawrence as an actress will come to terms with her hard hitting abilities after watching 'Joy.'Co-starring David O. Russell's usual suspects like Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper, accompanied by other equally outstanding talents such as Edgar Ramirez, 'Joy' is inspired by real life entrepreneur, Joy Mangano who went through difficult times to eventually become multi-millionaire through her miracle mop invention and her Ingenious Designs company. So I'm not sure how faithful 'Joy' is to this true story because it's not an adaptation, it's original screenplay and I think David O. Russell injected much of his signature style, the family aspects and how certain family members can often hold you back.Jennifer Lawrence plays Joy who since she was a little girl has always been fascinated with creating and inventing, she has sharp imaginative mind, but it gets locked away for years after her parents divorce and her marriage crumbles. She finds herself being the center of the universe of these good- for-nothing penniless family members and ex-husband mooching off her. Struggling to raise her kid while keeping her head above water, she taps into her childhood wonder and focuses on an idea. But it's not an easy smooth- sailing journey because her family members, as always, get in the way, doubting her, telling her to be realistic and just forget about her dreams. Joy keeps pushing through the storm, working on getting the right people and getting the right investments to believe in her idea, anytime there's a glimmer of hope, something else often comes in and crushes it. But Joy keeps rising up again and again and again.Much of 'Joy' reminds you of David O. Russell's 'The Fighter,' any moment I was just expecting Jennifer Lawrence to get in the ring and point to people around her and say, 'I'm the one fighting OK, not you, not you, and not you.' But in all seriousness, I think part of the appeal of stories like 'The Fighter' and 'Joy' which I'm sure captivated David O. Russell as well is the underdog achieving American dream despite discouraging voices around them, it's the same reason why we champion Rocky Balboa. And Jennifer Lawrence is so fierce and fearless in her performance, it really is a privilege to watch her do her thing, because her wide range of emotions are absolutely incredible and it's so effortless on her part. You feel for her character, Joy, every step of the way.I think 'Joy' is a very important film that everybody and their grandmas should see, because it doesn't just show the hardship of entrepreneurial spirit, but it also goes to show that the road to having the life that we want is not easy. There are moments when you think Joy is finally going to catch a break, but something happens that pushes her down the stairs to rock bottom again. But it's all in the trajectory, Joy chooses to search inward for strength and keep looking up. Many of us can relate to this story, especially yours truly, I've lost count how many times people have told me that Rama's Screen isn't going to get me anywhere, that it's just a hobby, that I shouldn't give it a 100%, but I think you don't have to struggle through owning a business to understand where Joy is coming from. Yes, life happens, I've heard that excuse a thousand times, but it doesn't mean that you can't happen too.",Null,10,30,20 December 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Powerful! A remarkable film about a remarkable true story.
","Whatever opinions you may have of Mel Gibson, the man did say some terrible things in the past, but one thing we can't get over is the fact that he's a master filmmaker. HACKSAW RIDGE is a powerful depiction of pure-hearted heroism. A remarkable film about an remarkable true story you can't believe actually happened. And with his compelling performance, Andrew Garfield has placed himself among some of the greatest actors of all time.Desmond T. Doss (Andrew Garfield) was Seventh-Day Adventist, a faithful Christian. But when WWII happened, he couldn't sit idly by while his fellow brothers went out to fight. Not believing in killing, Doss refused to take up arms and instead chose to serve as Army medic. This personal decision caused tension in his unit, but ultimately the army allowed him to go into hell fire without a single weapon to protect him. There at the Battle of Okinawa, one of the bloodiest battles of WWII, Doss ended up saving the lives of many of his fellow soldiers resulting in him being the first conscientious objector in American history to be awarded the Medal of Honor.In this day and age when ignorant folks like Trump loudly and proudly describe masculinity as marginalizing the others and oppressing the powerless, stories like Desmond Doss reminds us what it truly means to be courageous. That's what I love about this is that it turns the notion that if you don't kill, then you're a coward, over on its head. It's a miracle if you think about it, Doss risked his life in the midst of a battlefield to pull his fellow soldiers one by one to safety, a story that remarkable deserves well-crafted film and that's what HACKSAW RIDGE gives us.Excellent performances by all the actors involved in this film, almost all of them are not even actual Americans and yet you can't tell difference when you see them on the screen because they embody the essence and they serve the story with immense respect. That transition from this beautiful landscape of home and romance into an awful place where bodies mangled everywhere, that itself will evoke heart-wrenching emotions. Of course, this is a Mel Gibson movie, so don't expect any less than hard R, the man doesn't shy away from cinematic violence, so brace yourself for intense prolonged graphic war sequences and grisly images, just as the rating itself says, it will get you to the core. Much bloodier war sequences than 'Saving Private Ryan.' But I think that is necessary because in order to do Doss' story justice, you can't sugarcoat or soften what have clearly been described in war records about those fateful days.In his portrayal of Desmond Doss, Andrew Garfield approaches it like the good guys' good guy, so convincingly that by the end of this film, even if you're not much a man of faith, you're going to say, 'I want what that guy has.' There's something that's so Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart about Andrew Garfield in this film. This is his most mature, most perfect performance yet.Overall, you don't have to be a Christian to fully appreciate this film, Mel Gibson himself had said that this is a love story, a man's love for his fellow man. So if you come at it from that perspective, you'll still be able to embrace it too, because Doss' story needs to be told and shared from one generation to the next and HACKSAW RIDGE is a great way of going about it.-- Rama's Screen --",10,10,19,3 November 2016
Warcraft," Epic! Spectacular!
","Wow! I did not expect WARCRAFT movie to be this spectacular. And I'm not a gamer nor have I ever even played Warcraft games, so to come across an adaptation that is so well-done, so well-crafted is a breath of fresh air. This movie is as epic as it gets, jaw-dropping and visually stunning, a magnificent cinematic experience.Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures gave you this adventure saga based on Blizzard Entertainment's iconic property. Directed by Duncan Jones who spent more than three years working on this project, the story is essentially about a peaceful realm that suddenly faces the fearsome Orcs who have fled their dying home in search of a refuge. A portal connects these two worlds that ultimately collide in a massive war for the fate of their family, their people, and their home.I had my worries at first because I feared that since I didn't know much about Warcraft universe and its mythology that the film would somehow lose me. But the writers including Duncan Jones came up with this heroic story with its many complications and all shades of grey, because the motivations on both sides can be justified depending on how you look at each of them, and it's so well-structured that anybody can follow it just fine; that they can invest themselves in it. And there's balance as well, you'd enjoy the orcs storyline just as much as you'd enjoy the human dramas. Some can even draw Israel - Palestinian struggle comparison with this film, but that's another topic for another time.This year alone, just when you thought 'The Jungle Book' had raised the bar in terms of visual effects, this WARCRAFT movie comes along and splits us in half, basically. Watching it in 3D even adds to its already many breathtaking, mind-blowing sequences. The world created, including the houses, the castles, the creatures, the designs are nothing short of astonishing, clearly this is the work of people who truly cared for this game, that said, this is a film that exits not only to just pay homage to the game, it's not by any means trying too hard either, it's the perfect mash-up of a great story, solid characters, and outstanding spectacle. The best high-fantasy film since 'The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy.-- Rama's Screen --",9,2,3,8 June 2016
In the Land of Blood and Honey," Everyone is guilty
","I'd have to somewhat agree with those who think that this is more or  less Angelina Jolie's very own Schindler's List and there's a bit of  Romeo & Juliet element to it as well, and just like the Shakespearean  classic itself, this too is a tragedy. Quite ambitious and daring for a  feature directorial debut but I wasn't completely surprised because  this film came from an Oscar winning actress whose humanitarian work,  especially for this region, has been very passionate. Jolie's future as  a filmmaker looks promising..  Jolie doesn't hold back in her effort to show how brutal the Bosnian  war was. The environment looks authentic and harsh. And just like  Spielberg's 1993 Oscar winning film, IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY  also invests most of its time going into details about the killings and  the disregard for human life. The raping scenes would be uncomfortable  for some to watch. I remember I attended the press screening, it was  already a few minutes into the movie and at the door there was a person  who I thought at first was the studio's rep but then she told me she  was a fellow press member and she was there just to wait until the rape  scene ended so she could then re-enter the room and watch the rest of  the film. Some may argue that this is a one sided story, everybody is  entitled to their opinion, if this was indeed a movie that's pro  Bosnian Muslim or pro Serb, I wouldn't be able to tell because what I  saw was both sides killing each other and none of them was the better.  I think Jolie is just angry at the fact that the international  community did not intervene in time to stop the genocide or the ethnic  cleansing, and that anger is shared by many. This is film is her  showing how bad things can get when good me do nothing. And that's  basically the aim of IN THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY.  The backdrop is the Bosnian war but right at the heart of the story are  two key characters, Danijel played by a Bosnian Serb actor named Goran  Kostic and the other is Ajla played by a Bosnian named Zana Marjanovic.  They became representations of the two opposing sides and they're both  played by solid actors, Kostic has that arresting presence about him,  he could be sympathetic at one point, because he's stuck between  loyalty to his father and his love for Ajla, but at another point he  could also be distant. Kostic's emotional range is wide and the same  goes with Marjanovic, who is absolutely captivating. At one point she  makes you believe that her character Ajla is the protagonist, at  another point she makes you feel like she may be untrustworthy. It's a  very complicated love story because what those two characters have is  not exactly true love, despite whatever feeling they have for each  other, Danijel badly wanted Ajla to be a Serb and Ajla knows that she's  sleeping with the enemy. The line between the oppressor and the  oppressed gets blurred and everyone is guilty.",8,87,354,25 December 2011
13 Hours," 'Murica!
","I had my worries at first, I thought 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI may end up being too political, especially with the current election season, there may be pundits/opportunists who may use '13 Hours' and stretch its purpose. But I'm glad director Michael Bay doesn't focus on that, I'm glad he makes it be about the heroes and I think that's the right way to go about telling this tragic story. 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI is intense, it's explosive, it's the best war movie since 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Black Hawk Down' and it's one of those movies that solely aims to make you feel patriotic.Based on Mitchel Zukoff's book and adapted by Chuck Hogan who gave us 2010's 'The Town,' 13 HOURS is about those long bloody 13 hours when the U.S. embassy and compound in Libya were under attack, it's about the security team defending their place, it's like a modern day Alamo story.With the timing of this film's arrival, will the mainstream media blow this out of proportions again with theories on whether or not Secretary Hillary Clinton did all she could to send help, if the attack was motivated by anti-Islam video protests and so on and so forth, will it spark the controversies again? I don't know, that's out of my control. What I do know and what I do appreciate about 13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI, although it slightly touches on those possible theories, it keeps the focus tight on these few men, these few former soldiers who have families, who have real struggles, but they're willing to protect the lives of others first.13 HOURS: THE SECRET SODLIERS OF BENGHAZI has everything you'd expect in a Michael Bay, it's action-packed, it has that signature spinning shot, heavy emphasis on explosions, lots of firepower, beautiful women, it even has similar VFX shots that Bay applied on his 2001 war film, 'Pearl Harbor,' but minus the lovey dovey romance, thankfully. Those who know me well know that I'm not a Michael Bay fan, but this 13 HOURS is just a good old fashion good guy vs. bad guy. Very testosterone-driven. Of course real life conflicts in the real world are much greyer and more nuanced than that, so perhaps audiences would be divided over this but this film, for what it's trying to do, it does its job, and it doesn't demonize the Muslims, and it doesn't shy away either, it's as gritty and as violent as it gets, it will make you feel uncomfortable about the idea of war or killing somebody without diminishing the courage of these few men who at the end of the day just want to go home to their families. Finally, a Michael Bay movie I can be proud of watching.",8,2,11,13 January 2016
The Soloist," Nathaniel only has one thing going for him,.. a friend
","THE SOLOIST is a powerful, heartfelt, emotionally moving, human drama with two incredibly talented actors who give their all. It is every bit as wonderful as what it promises. Definitely one of the best films of the year. If you're looking for... an inspiring story, well then look no further. This is another accomplishment by Director Joe Wright (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement) I've always known Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr. are two great actors respectively but the mix of two is like combining two different formulas that compliment each other and create an atomic chemistry only described as something that no one else will ever manage to replicate. They can try but won't come out as good as these two.This is Jamie Foxx's best performance since Ray, and I'd vouch for a second nomination on the horizon. Robert Downey Jr. proves that he's versatile, that he's more than just Tony Stark and he still got pieces of greatness from when he played Chaplin years ago.We can't really compare the two characters with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man because unlike that movie, in this one, Downey's character, Lopez, doesn't try to take advantage of Jamie's character's, Nathaniel's musical talent. In fact, Lopez thinks that by fixing Nathaniel then maybe he could fix his broken marriage, he thinks that by fixing Nathaniel, he could fix L.A., he thinks that by fixing Nathaniel, all his writing and columns and accomplishment could mean something. But the problem is Nathaniel doesn't want to be fixed.Sometimes, the only way to heal somebody is just be a good friend in need. Sometimes we gotta accept the fact that some things can't be fixed and that being there for someone speaks louder than our aimless effort to turn them into something they're not.Nathaniel's love of music is his only connection to what's left that's good in his life, in the midst of chaos and confusion. A friend makes that connection even stronger.That's what I love about this movie, the story.Joe Wright's directing is superb, he understands the plot and how the actors should respond to whatever conflict that may surface. The locations chosen or how a scene would play out, his vision of it all is borderline perfect. The portrayal of the skid row and how the camera moves from one homeless guy to another and take us on this view of the forgotten little kingdom is quite humbling. Those of us who've seen the real LA would not find this to be an exaggeration. Director of Photography Seamus McGarvey should definitely be nominated again for the Cinematography, which is absolutely brilliant --Rama's SCREEN--",10,43,61,19 April 2009
The Martian," A monumental cinematic achievement
","The year's not over yet but if I were to form a list today, THE MARTIAN most definitely takes the top spot. It's the best movie of 2015 and quite frankly, it's the best Ridley Scott movie since 'Gladiator.' It's no secret that I found Scott's movies to have been quite disappointing over the past fifteen years or so, 'Kingdom Of Heaven,' 'Body Of Lies,' 'Robin Hood,' 'Prometheus' for example ‚Äî they just existed ‚Äî they didn't leave a mark nor carry a lot of weight. But I had hope that the director who gave us such classics as 'Alien,' and 'Blade Runner' would return to his form and I find that in THE MARTIAN.Based on Andy Weir's outstanding debut novel and adapted by Drew Goddard ('Cloverfield,' 'Cabin In The Woods') Oscar winner Matt Damon plays astronaut Mark Watney who's a member of the NASA crew that explores the planet Mars. A storm forces them to leave their mission but a debris hits Watney and he's presumed dead as his fellow crew members leave him behind. But surprise! Wanted survives, he must now figure out how to continue to survive on that desolate planet where nothing grows and his food supplies are dwindling while at the same time figure out how to make contact with NASA. Mark Watney relies on his wit, his botany skills, his courage and his strong determination to get through each day as NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home.What's funny about this is that a couple of years ago, Alfonso Cuaron's 'Gravity' was also the best movie of that year in my book, and last year, Matt Damon played a character in Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' that somewhat went through a similar situation as his 'The Martian' character, Mark Watney although they're not exact copy. But the point is, THE MARTIAN, at the heart of it, is a survival movie, just like any other survival movies you've seen about one person stranded on some island or some deserted place. What makes THE MARTIAN unique is that it's unlike any other sci-fi movies, mostly because author Andy Weir impressively did his best to make every aspect and every element of this film as accurate as possible. The extensive research is remarkable. In addition to that, the film feels like a series of solving math problem, one after another. Every time there's a glimmer of hope, a problem comes along and complicates the situation again, but it only pushes the characters to brainstorm, to think outside the box and reach out to other help.THE MARTIAN is a monumental cinematic achievement. From the story to the performances to the production design to the VFX, to the editing to every little detail of technical standpoint, everything about this film embodies excellence. It gives us what 'Interstellar' could not, because Nolan's movie meant well, but the concept unfortunately trumped its story whereas 'The Martian' has them go hand-in-hand. And perhaps some audiences might view this movie as a bit political especially with the scenario of NASA getting assistance from China's space program, but I think anybody from any background could view that as basic morality, the things that we humans could accomplish if we were to focus on a common goal instead of making it be only about a space race. It's amazing that even some smart nerd in Pasadena could bring positive contribution or an idea to the table. The movie is about a collaboration of all these people just to bring one man home, so it's more or it's a much bigger picture than just about Matt Damon's Mark Watney. THE MARTIAN is epic in every sense of the word, it will make you applaud at the end, it deserves a standing ovation.I hope THE MARTIAN would reignite today's generation's interest to once again dream big and look to the skies. Not everybody is going to be an astronaut or work for NASA's plan of someday putting a man on Mars, but personally, I think films like THE MARTIAN, stories such as this, solidify what I've always strongly believed to be true, science is sexy.",Null,2,60,30 September 2015
