E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A Wonderful Example of Marketing
","E.T.--- What a great example of taking a children's kindergarden story and marketing it as the science fiction masterpiece of our time. For those of you too young to remember it's initial release, that is exactly how the film was marketed to the viewing public.Then came the toys, the dolls, the games, the happy meals. All created prior to the film's debut so that Steven Spielberg could buy another yacht. The entire movie was filled with gimmicks from AT&T's buy-in of 'Phone Home' to the film's two hour commercial for Reeses Pieces. Let's not forget how this ground-sinking, anti-epic was also the springboard for Drew Barrymore's extensive film career which hit a pinnacle when she exposed her breasts to David Letterman on 'The Late Show'. Her dad must be very proud.E.T. should stand for Extreme Torture. This film rates a 10 on the Puke-O-Meter.",1,53,132,19 July 2010
