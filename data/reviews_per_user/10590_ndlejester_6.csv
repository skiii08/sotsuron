Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I laughed. A lot.
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is quite the riot.This movie has a beautifully simple concept behind it: Borat Sagdiyev, played by Sacha Baron Cohen, is a researcher from Kazakhstan who is to go to America and learn the ways of Americans to 'make benefit glorious nation of Kazahstan' accompanied by his producer Azamat. During his coast to coast journey for research, we see the cultural differences of Borat and the American public which create all too funny situations that had me in stitches for a majority of the film.It seems that most of this film was semi-thought out. The situation Borat put himself in seemed to be predetermined, but the way he went about it definitely did not seemed scripted. Even with this sort of quasi-thought out movie and plot, Cohen delivers with a hay-maker each and every scene. Some are shockingly wild, some are full of racism, some are just downright absurd; but not once does Cohen fail to deliver. This is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and the hardest I have laughed in a theater since Wedding Crashers.All in all, I gave this movie a 9 out of 10. Well worth your few bucks to have an immense laugh hour and a half laugh-fest.",9,2,8,10 November 2006
Fight Club," Absolutely Stunning
","I am commenting on this movie after the second time I've seen it. The first time was about 3 or 4 years ago, and I was old enough to get some of the movie, but not all of it. However, I was old enough to realize I shouldn't watch it again until I was a bit more schooled and now that I'm a senior in college I thought I'd give it a go again. Am I ever glad I did.Fight Club is the journey of our semi-main character, a man who never gives his real name, played by Edward Norton. He is affectionately known as 'the clever guy' by the other semi-main character, Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. Both of these actors put forth AMAZING performances; quite possibly the best I have ever seen in my short movie-going career.The movie goes on the tell the almost endless list of stories that Norton/Pitt (who are collectively the same person) get themselves (himself) into: from the birth of an underground boxing club (Fight Club), to stealing human fat from a liposuction clinic to make soap (nitro-glycerin actually), to the eventual rise of Project Mayhem and the unfolding of their scheme to clean the slate so to speak. I don't want to say too much about the plot for those who haven't seen it yet. But inside this incredibly convoluted story there is an amazing amount of social commentary and hints of philosophy which makes watching this movie a very rich and potent experience.The world created in Fight Club is just perfect. The lighting, the camera work, the narration, the dialogue between character; all perfect. The soundtrack for this film is absolutely spot on, I had not a single qualm with the music selections. It all flows to create an amazing movie experience.All in all, quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen, and easily one of my favorites. 10/10 for sure.",10,1,3,21 November 2006
The Bourne Identity," A great movie
","I hadn't watched this movie in a while, so I decided to pop it in a give it a watch. Boy was I pleasantly surprised I did.I didn't recall much of the movie, only that I enjoyed it enough to buy the DVD. The movie has a great raw feel to it, really adding the perfect element to this whole 'Who am I?' feel throughout the movie. Matt Damon plays his role as the amnesia filled Jason Bourne very well in my opinion. He's wound up tightly enough that every little comment about his past gets to him. And he then goes and takes out his anger out on everything the CIA throws at him. All the elements add together to make a great movie; the camera work, the scenes, the colors, and especially the soundtrack...it was all definitely thought out perfectly.On the whole I'd give this film somewhere near a 8.25/10...but for round numbers' sake, I'll drop it down to 8 for this enjoyable action film. I hope the Bourne Ultimatum is just as good!",8,0,1,11 August 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Quirky goodness
","Ocean's Eleven brings nothing but smiles to my face every time I see it. The aspect I enjoy most in this flick is the overall light atmosphere given to a very serious act (robbing a casino in Vegas). Clooney and Pitt make an awesome tag team of dry humor and brilliant masterminds of this movie. And the fact that Pitt is shoving something in his mouth almost every scene he's in just adds to his sarcastic character. Other than the two head honchos, the rest of the eleven do their job and do it well. Terry Benedict was played a bit dry for my tastes, but it was consistent throughout the film so at least it's a dislike I can appreciate. On a side note, the soundtrack fits absolutely perfectly for this quirky joyride of a movie. I would give this movie somewhere near a 7.5 on the whole.",8,0,0,12 July 2006
Independence Day," Great fun here
","This film is a blast to watch, plain and simple. Sure, there isn't a great deal of character development and the plot is very straight forward, but not every movie has to be that way to be awesome. The movie grabs your attention from beginning to end and is very enjoyable throughout. Sure there are some lulls, but the more tense scenes make up for everything and then some. Will Smith is in his classic character here, full of his usual pep and one liners. The others put in good efforts as well, I particularly like Goldblum's role as the cable repairman. The special effects are good, the music is great, and I absolutely adore Bill Pullman's 'independence day' speech. That alone makes this movie worth watching.",7,0,2,4 July 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Ricky Bobby for the win
","Being the huge fan of Will Ferrell that I am, I was almost obliged to see Talladega Nights. Boy am I glad that I did.The movie started off a bit slow to me, but it definitely had it's laughs as the characters and plot took shape. As the film continued, the laughs got better and better, with the ultimate laugh coming at the climax of the film in the race between our hero, Ricky Bobby, and that French dude played by Ali G.Speaking of Ali G, Sasha Cohen stole the show with his performance as Jean Girard. Every time he spoke I was in stitches, his accent being enough to have me lose it.Another high light of this film was the speech given by Susan (Amy Adams). This speech had me howling in the theater, with stares ensuing. It was worth it.All in all the film was worth my nine bucks, but just keep in mind sometimes the film seemed to drag a bit. And while the laughs were hearty, they were sometimes intermittent. But if you're looking for a good laugh and some speedy fun, Talladega Nights is for you.Overall: 6.5/10...for IMDb.com's rating, I'll put it up to a 7 for the sake of round numbers.",7,0,2,12 August 2006
