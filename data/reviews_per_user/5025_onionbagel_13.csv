Resident Evil: Afterlife," A step in the wrong direction! :(
","Technically speaking, Resident Evil: Afterlife DOES pick up where the previous film left off, but literally only for the opening scene. Alice and her clones do go on an all-out assault against Umbrella HQ in Tokyo (as promised) (the virus has spread pretty far at this point), but then the movie goes downhill from there.Alice travels the world in her plane in search of Arcadia (from the previous movie), and eventually runs into Claire (also from the previous movie); however, she has no memory of anything and has a metallic-bug-like device on her chest (compliments of Umbrella) and she tries to kill Alice.Once Alice removes it, her and Claire come across a prison with survivors. They show Alice a ship off in the distance called the 'Arcadia' and they think Alice was sent in her plane (that she could barely land on the prison roof) to rescue them.The rest of the movie consists of everyone pretty much hanging out at the prison and doing nothing UNTIL zombies break in (I KNOW! SHOCKER!) and a large obviously-mutated-by-Umbrella man carrying an even larger axe/meat tenderizer. The fight between him and Alice & Claire is literally the best (and really only good part) of the movie.There's a pretty lame Matrix-rip-off fight between the gang and Wesker, then the movie ends with Alice broadcasting that the 'Arcadia' is now inhabited and indeed a safe haven for survivors.FINAL VERDICT: Partially because this movie was coming off the heals of RE: Extinction (the best RE at this point in my opinion), and honestly just because nothing really happened, I deem this movie 'the worst Resident Evil', hands-down. If you've never seen all of them (and you're gonna have a marathon), then sure, watch all of them, but as a stand-alone movie, i do NOT recommend this movie.",6,1,4,30 January 2017
Resident Evil: Extinction," Best Resident Evil movie (at this point in time)!
","Resident Evil: Extinction picks up where the previous one (RE: Apocalypse) left off. What's left of the world is a deserted (both in terms of emptiness and the desert) and Alice is pretty much moving,killing, and surviving. Her and a new group of survivors (one, an old friend from the previous movie) decide to try and head for a place in Alaska (they start off in Vegas) called 'Arcadia'. The movie is a cross between Resident Evil, Mad Max and the Birds (watch the movie to figure out that last comparison!), and it is one hell of a ride! At the end of the movie, Alice kills Doctor Isaacs (not really) and finds all her clones and vows to use them to go after Umbrella and shut them down for good! FINAL VERDICT: In terms of video game-movie adaptations, this one isn't very true-to-the-games (maybe a little like RE5 because it takes place in the desert). But again, if you like action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls or all of the above...you'll LOVE this movie!!!!!",10,2,2,29 January 2017
Suicide Squad," DC's Guardians of the Galaxy!
","I don't know why the critics are hating on this awesome movie, and I can't fathom them (Rotten Tomatoes) giving it the same score as BVS (which ACTUALLY was terrible)! Suicide Squad was a fun movie, just like Guardians of the Galaxy. That's the best way I can describe it, is FUN!If you've read any of the Suicide Squad comics or at least watched the TV show Arrow, you know that the suicide squad is a bunch of 'bad guys' who are given the opportunity to do something good.The movie is very funny, light hearted and action packed. What I think I liked most though (aside from the star of the show Harley Quinn) is that the trailer DID NOT spoil everything! I won't spoil anything either, but let's just say that who the trailers lead you to believe the 'villain' is (The Joker), isn't actually the villain.*****I put villain in quotes because they're all bad guys obviously, but someone has to be THE 'villain' in the movie.***** I was a little disappointed that the Joker wasn't in the movie more, but at least they threw us a curve ball by making us think he was the 'villain' when in fact he was kind of off doing his own thing.FINAL VERDICT: Suicide Squad will appeal to anyone who loves action OR comedy. If you Liked Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, Deadpool, etc, (AND YOU'RE NOT A CRITIC) you will love this movie! PS - Jared Leto's Joker was good, but still not better than Heath Ledger's (unbeatable) performance. I also think though, that since the Joker wasn't in this movie much, that no-one can accurately judge Jared's Joker until he's in another movie like Suicide Squad 2 (this movie was left WIDE open for a sequel) or maybe the Harley Quinn movie.",9,1,5,6 August 2016
Resident Evil," Great video game-movie adaptation!
","Let me start off by saying 2 things: 1. I have played all the 'core' Resident Evil games (1-6). 2. I like the 6 movies more than the 6 games.Review for if you've played the game(s): The first Resident Evil movie starts off in the mansion much like the first game, but doesn't stay there long. Alice (the protagonist) (NOT in the games!) wakes up with no memory and ends up going below the mansion to a place called 'The Hive' (Umbrella Corp's secret facility). Her and a group of Umbrella spec-ops are tasked with containing/killing a leaked virus before the infection spreads across the city above (and the rest of the world). There are of course zombies and 'lickers' (from the games), but also an 'enemy' called 'The Red Queen' who is the security AI that locked down 'The Hive' to contain the disease. In the end, Alice (and one other member) escapes to find Umbrella scientists waiting for them back in the mansion. Alice is taken to a lab in Raccoon City and her friend is put into the 'Nemesis Program'.Review for if you HAVEN'T played the game(s): A girl named Alice wakes up with no memory in a fake mansion above a secret government facility. In this facility, a virus is spread and the facility is locked down by the AI running the place. Alice and some spec-ops agents must kill/contain the infected in order to prevent the spreading of disease to the city above (and the rest of the world). FINAL VERDICT: If you're into action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls or all of the above, you'll like this movie. If you are a HUGE fan of the Resident Evil video games (especially the first one), you may not.",8,3,4,29 January 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," There was an idea...and Disney ruined it! (or so I thought)
","A decade ago the Marvel Cinematic Universe started with Iron Man. I don't think anyone disputes they had a good thing going from the get-go; however, some people (such as myself) feel that SOME (NOT ALL) of the MCU movies have gotten 'Disnyfied' (*cough* Thor: Ragnarok *cough*). I must admit, I had all but abandoned the MCU ever since Avengers: Age of Ultron. I feel that every movie since Age of Ultron has been hit-or-miss, and have only continued watching in hopes that the next installment be a groundbreaking rebirth for the MCU.*****I didn't like Age of Ultron because it was essentially the same movie as The Avengers but with a subtitle, Civil War both because it just wasn't a good movie AND it wasn't comic-correct, Ragnarok because it was just plain DUMB, and Black Panther because it was WAY too slow!***** That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with Infinity War! I recently read some of the comics it's 'based on' (Thanos Quest & Infinity Gauntlet), and the series that follow (Infinity War, Infinity Crusade & Infinity Abyss), and was again pleasantly surprised to see some scenes straight from the comics (such as Hulk crashing into Doctor Strange's 'home', Groot wrap up Thanos and 'the snap' to name a few). As we all know, Disney doesn't have the rights to the X-Men yet (soon), so I can't call their lack of appearance 'inaccurate'. Even though 'the snap' may seem like a douchey way to guarantee people see 'part 2', it IS straight out of the comics (DON'T FRET PEOPLE! MOST CHARACTERS WILL BE BACK IN PART 2!). *****My ONLY complaint is that Thanos' quote from the trailer ('Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But this...does put a smile on my face.') DIDN'T make it into the movie!?*****Enough of me babbling, GO SEE THIS MOVIE (this is coming from someone who went in with little-to-no expectations AND read the comics)!",10,2,4,1 May 2018
Ex Machina," Ex Machina is Ex-traordinary!
","*****THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS!***** After it was announced that Alicia Vikander would be playing Lara Croft in the new Tomb Raider movie (based on the 2013 video game), I figured I should watch one of her movies. I really have no desire to watch The Danish Girl, but I always wanted to see Ex Machina; just never got around to it.*Also, I LOVE Alex Garland's movie Dredd so I had a good feeling about Ex Machina.* Ex Machina is about a programmer (named Caleb) who is given the opportunity to work with his boss (Nathan) for a week on a secret project (in a secret compound). Turns out he has successfully created an AI (Artificial Intelligence) (named Ava) that is 100% human-like.Originally, Caleb was just supposed to interact with Ava and 'pick her brain' so to speak. As the story progresses though, Caleb falls for Ava (yes, a human falls for an AI; GET OVER IT!); and she appears to fall for him too, but is her love real? The movie has a very 'M. Night Shyamalan-esque' ending with a very surprising turn of events at the end. (Honestly, I didn't see it coming!) I believe the point of the movie (and the ending) was to show that maybe someday we will create AI that is SO realistic (if our government hasn't already), that it will gain TRUE human qualities; whether good OR bad.FINAL VERDICT: This movie blew me away! I'm used to sci-fi movies being interesting AND action-packed, and even though Ex Machina only had one 'action' scene, it was so interesting and did such an amazing job at sucking me in, that I didn't mind that there wasn't any action. Alex Garland is such a good writer and director and I can't wait for his new movie Annihilation! If it's as good as Dredd and half as good as Ex Machina, it should be pretty amazing!",10,1,4,22 May 2016
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Great adaptation of Resident Evil: ORC!
","Resident Evil Apocalypse is a loose adaptation of the video game Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City, and/or a cross between Resident Evil 2 & Resident Evil: Nemesis.Alice wakes up in the Raccoon City lab (that was referenced at the end of the first movie) and finds herself in an abandoned, post-apocalyptic city called Raccoon City. She meets several people along the way (some survivors, some spec-ops like the first movie) and they try to find a way out of the city together (the government is going to nuke Raccoon City to contain/kill the infected/the T-Virus). Towards the end of the movie, Alice must face a 'boss' (like in the video games) called 'The Nemesis'. He is virtually indestructible; she finds out it is one of the people from the first movie (Michael) and he ends up sacrificing himself to save the group from a helicopter crash. The final scene reveals that a man named Doctor Isaacs cloned Alice (this will come into play in the next movie).FINAL VERDICT: Unlike the first movie, this one was pretty accurate to the games (in my opinion); so...if you like action movies, zombies, bad-ass girls, or all of the above AND the Resident Evil games, you'll like this movie!",9,1,1,29 January 2017
Logan," The end of one era, but the beginning of another.
","I'm gonna keep this review short so as not to spoil a truly spectacular movie.Everything (positive) you've heard/read about Logan is 100% TRUE! It's a great movie, a great comic book movie, the best X-Men Movie, the best wolverine movie, etc. It's a lot like Watchmen (to me) in the aspect that it's a comic book movie that doesn't feel/play out out like one. It's emotional, it's (mostly) serious, it's sad, and it really touches you as you watch. Is it sad that this is Hugh's last performance as Wolverine/Logan: yes, but the introduction of Laura/X-23 is (in my opinion) a really good play for Fox. If they try to re-cast Wolvie too soon, fans will be outraged, but by introducing X-23 (a brand-new, but similar character) we can have several new movies, characters, adventures, etc until Fox deems enough time has passed for the introduction of a new 'Wolverine'.Again, i don't wanna spoil anything so I'll leave you with this: whether you're a comic book fan, an action-movie fan, or just a movie fan, you'll LOVE this movie. It tells a spectacular, touching story, and it has plenty of the brutal R-rated action that Wolverine fans have wanted to see for so long. GO SEE IT! I promise you WON'T be disappointed! PS - for all you avid comic readers: with the exception of characters that Marvel Studios has the rights to (Captain America, Hawkeye & The Hulk come to mind) this is the most true-to-the-book adaptation I've seen since Deadpool last year.",10,0,3,4 March 2017
Joker," The Man who Laughs
","Let Me start off by saying that when I have a hard time scoring a movie, I refer to my personal scale. I associate each number with a corresponding word/phrase; the scale is as follows:
1 - GOD-AWFUL
2 - Awful
3 - REALLY bad
4 - Bad
5 - Okay
6 - Good
7 - REALLY good
8 - Great
9 - DAMN-NEAR perfect
10 - PERFECTMy starting point with 'Joker' was a 6 ('Good'); however, once I took into account the politics, comic INaccuracy, and the fact that it's essentially a rip-off of Mary Harron's 'American Psycho', I settled on a score of 5.Let's start with politics. Hollywood has it in their head that they're doing some sort of public service by shoving AT LEAST one political agenda down your throat with basically every movie (and T.V. show) these days. Although it was part of the story (and some would argue a 'crucial' part of the story), there were definitely (unnecessary in my opinion) politics in this movie. The fact that Thomas Wayne couldn't be with Penny Fleck (Arthur/Joker's mother) because of public image; When funding was cut and Arthur no longer had a therapist and medication; When Arthur killed the three Wall Street boys (in self-defense) on the train. This last one's the most important; it's a re-occurring aspect of the movie. Towards the end of the movie (when Arthur's GONNA blow his brains out on the 'Murray Franklin Show') Arthur points out that if he (or someone in the same social class as him) died, they'd just 'walk over him', but since three perfect little Wall Street boys died, we should all be in mourning. I won't deny the fact that this is an important aspect of the movie, but again Hollywood thinks we 'need' politics in everything nowadays.Onto comic INaccuracy. It's no secret that this movie was never going to be a faithful adaptation of the Joker; however, (as someone who does read comics) I can't overlook the inaccuracies of this movie. Joker has had many origin stories over the years (since many authors have wanted a crack at one of 'the greatest comic book villains of all time'), but the most common is the Red Hood story. Basically he's just a 'normal' person who has to resort to crime to support his wife and baby-on-the-way when he has a run-in with Batman; this encounter ends with Joker falling into a vat of acid that: bleaches his skin, dies his lips blood-red and plasters a permanent smile on his face. In this movie however, Arthur takes medication (primarily) for Pseudobulbar Affect (P.B.A.), or uncontrollable laughing/laughing at random times. Although this 'makes sense' for a Joker adaptation, it's NOT comic accurate. May I also just add that Joaquin's laugh in this movie is SO ANNOYING!? Pretty much every scene has random, unnecessary, annoying laughter!My last point is that 'Joker' is pretty much a knock-off version of 'American Psycho'. For those of you unfamiliar with the movie (based on Brett Easton Ellis's DARKLY satirical novel), it follows a Wall Street yuppie named Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) who fantasizes about murdering people. The book ends with Patrick confessing but you find out it was all in his head; the movie however, also ends with a (REAL) confession but nobody believes him. I bring this novel-turned-movie up because Patrick also keeps a diary/journal with drawings of what he does/wants to do to people, much like how Arthur writes down his jokes and has pictures of naked women in his diary/journal.In conclusion, I never thought that even Joaquin Phoenix could defeat Heath Ledger and become 'THE Clown Prince of Crime', but I though maybe he could at least match him. Did he? Performance-wise yes; however, the movie itself was good NOT great. Joker currently has a 8.9 here on IMDb, and (after scrolling through reviews) I've noticed that anything below a 9 only appears 'once in a blue moon'. The two people I went with both give it a 10/10 whereas I gave it a 5; maybe I'm crazy, maybe I read too many comics, or maybe I watch too many movies, but 'That's Life...'",5,2,15,13 October 2019
Wonder Woman," A pathetic copy of both Captain America AND Thor!?
","I have recently joked that I am 'switching to 'Team DC' due to all the politically correct BS in Marvel's comics that is slowly creeping into their movies (changing characters' gender, sexual orientation, etc.); in all seriousness, I do think DC movies tend to have better stories than Marvel movies...until now! The story-line of Wonder Woman seems like nothing more than a blend of Captain America (1) and Thor (1); Diana comes from a world of gods, journeys to civilization on Earth (Thor), at a time when we at currently at war (Captain America). The resemblances DON'T stop there though. If you recall the ending of Captain America: Steve crashes the ship in the ice to save others while on the phone with Peggy (all-the-while looking at a picture of her); in Wonder Woman, Steve (Chris Pine) blows up a plane to stop a deadly chemical warfare gas from being unleashed, and Diana/Wonder Woman looks at his picture at the war memorial afterwards...seems familiar??? Also, if you've seen Daredevil and Elektra, you'd probably agree that Elektra's brief part in DD was better than her ENTIRE solo film; i feel the same about Wonder Woman's part in Batman V Superman (compared to her own movie).Lastly, as a lot of people said about Deadpool, I felt that Wonder Woman (the movie in general, not WW herself) tried TOO hard to be funny at times.If it wasn't a copy, I'd probably give it a 6/10 (passing by college standards); it wasn't anything new (an origin story), it was slow (but most DC movies seem so the first time around; I'd have probably changed my review later like I did with BVS, and not nearly as good a story as something like BVS.All in all, I set my expectations high with ALL DC movies, and this one fell short.",5,7,18,4 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Zack Snyder's worst movie ever.
","Let me start off by saying 2 things:1. I am a huge Zack Snyder fan. Watchmen is my favorite comic book movie of all time, and 300 and Man of Steel were great as well. 2. This is one of the few comic book movies where I actually read the book prior to seeing the movie.Now for the review.Having read the book, I didn't walk into the movie with very high hopes. The story was pretty basic (in the book as well as the movie) and the only character whose actor portrayal I like is Henry Cavill as Superman. I am not a huge fan of Ben Affleck, and although Gal Gadot is a good actress, I don't think she's right for the part of Wonder Woman. So, my first complaint was simply casting.The next thing that went wrong was the story. As I said it was pretty basic. Batman is afraid of the unknown (Superman's power) and wants to keep Gotham safe; Really not much of a story. And I won't spoil how, but it deviated from the comic quite a bit (especially the ending).The biggest problem I felt this movie had, was pacing/time. Me and my dad looked at each other after the first hour, and both unanimously said how bored we were. Honestly, only the last (approximately) 45 minutes were good. (Again so as not to spoil anything) it got good after Lex Luthor 'threatened' Superman. I can't justify ever purchasing a movie on Blu-ray/DVD only to watch the last 45 minutes.Final verdict: I give the movie 3 stars for 2 reasons: 1. Zack Snyder, Henry Cavill and some good action/special effects (1 star each). 2. As I said previously, I enjoyed about the last third of the movie, so that equates to about 3/10 stars in my book.Zack tried to make an epic journey/story which has never been done in comic movies before, and it fell flat on it's face. Is it worth the money to see at theaters? To some, yes. Is it worth the TIME (2 and 1/2 hours? Definitely NO!PS - Parts of the movie seemed like one big advertisement for the next 6 DC movies: Aquaman, Cyborg, Flash, Wonder Woman and Justice League parts 1 & 2. So essentially, you're paying whatever obscene amount of money your theater charges and watching a 2 and 1/2 hour advertisement.I recently purchased the Ultimate Edition of BVS on Blu-ray (for $15 at Wal-mart!?) and watched the extended cut. I don't know if it's just one of those 'gotta see it more than once' movies, or if it was simply because it was the extended cut rather than the theatrical, but this time around my dad and I actually liked it! Still not the best superhero movie, but I retract my previous statement of it being 'the worst movie ever'.NEW VERDICT: THEATRICAL VERSION: Still a 3/10EXTENDED CUT: 7/10OVERALL RATING: 5/10",9,1,6,25 March 2016
Deadpool," Time to make the chimi-f***in-changas!
","Now you may be wondering why someone who saw this AWESOME movie opening weekend is writing a review NOW? The very simple answer: Batman V Superman sucked (I wrote a bad review for it) and it made me want to praise a recent comic book movie that DIDN'T suck!Ever since that abomination they called 'Deadpool' in X-Men Origins: Wolverine I became a pretty big fan of the REAL Deadpool. I own and have read the entire 'Deadpool & Cable' series and the 'Merc with a Mouth' series and absolutely love them. I will admit when this movie was announced, I didn't know much about early (90's) Deadpool which is what the movie was based on, but I did know Deadpool himself.Now for the review: This movie was perfect from the opening credits all the way to the ending credits. They made me laugh, they were creative and it's even funnier if you know how the opening credits came to be (LOOK IT UP!) I don't watch comedies very often, but how I judge them is simple: how much time out of the movie do I spend laughing my @$$ off! In Deadpool, the answer is THE WHOLE TIME!Between breaking the fourth wall, pop culture references, and references to other movies (both Marvel movies & Ryan Reynold's movies) the only way you cannot laugh is if you have no sense of humor (or a clean one, which is boring!)As for the story, it is Deadpool's origin story. Long story short, Wade Wilson (Deadpool) gets cancer, he's made an offer he can't refuse (well he does at first) and in curing his cancer, he becomes horribly disfigured. He then goes on a revenge mission to kill Francis/Ajax (he doesn't like the name Francis!) My only real complaint to the story was, much like Iron-Man 3, it jumped around a lot/wasn't chronological. That's just a personal pet peeve though; probably won't bother everyone.The characters: Deadpool - the Merc-with-a-Mouth out for revenge. Vanessa - Wade's girlfriend/future baby-mama. Weasel - Deadpool's BFF/weapons dealer/intel guy. Colossus - The big CGI metal guy from the X-Men. Negasonic Teenage Warhead - The moody teen/X-Men protegee. Francis/Ajax - British villain who turns wade into an abomination. Angel Dust - Francis' right-hand woman who does most of his dirty work.Summary: The movie plays out in such a way that it will please action fans, comedy fans, comic fans, and honestly probably anyone with a messed-up sense of humor. If you're okay with swearing, inappropriate jokes, sex and lots of blood; THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU! If not, well then that's too bad (you're missing out!)Final verdict: I WOULD give Deadpool a full 10/10 instead of 9/10, if not for these 2 things: 1. The non-chronological story (like I said, just a personal pet peeve) 2. I saw it opening weekend as well as the following weekend, and it wasn't as funny the second time. I'm not saying it wan't AWESOME a second time, I'm just saying that when I buy it on Blu-ray I can't watch it too often/soon. I gotta leave some time in-between viewings so the jokes aren't fresh in my mind.GO SEE THIS MOVIE, AND BUY IT WHEN IT COMES OUT! IT DESERVES EVERY PENNY IT'S MADE! GOOD JOB FOX/MARVEL!",1,3,10,26 March 2016
The Nice Guys," I absolutely LOVE this movie!
","I'm gonna start off by saying 2 things: 1. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet because I don't wanna take the chance of spoiling such a great movie.2. I haven't laughed this hard since February of this year when I saw Deadpool.I was expecting The Nice Guys to be an action movie with some comedy mixed in, but in reality it was a comedy with some action mixed in.The movie is about 2 private eyes who end up working together to solve a case that they (unknowingly) are both working on. It takes place in the 70's in a time where private eyes can do pretty much whatever they want, and crime is running rampant. Their chemistry is great; they harass each other all the time, tell each other what they're doing wrong, and actually end up learning a thing or two from each other. (Their relationship is kinda like Murtaugh and Riggs' from Lethal Weapon) All in all, this movie is perfect in every way. It's violent, hilarious, old-school and JUST PLAIN FUN. If you loved Lethal Weapon (and you should), you will love The Nice Guys. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!",10,4,10,21 May 2016
