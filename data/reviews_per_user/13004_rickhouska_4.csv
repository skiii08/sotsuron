The Equalizer," Meet the inverted Caspar Milquetoast, a man who speaks softly and hits with a mighty big stick.
","Denzel Washington plays the title role as Robert McCall. In this reincarnation of the Edward Woodward TV series (1985), there is no Jaguar for McCall to move around NYC, as a suave, well dressed guy with a British accent. Instead, Washington's McCall gets around Boston by walking and public transportation. He is a very average guy who keeps to himself, lives modestly, and works at Home Mart, a Hollywood version of Home Depot or Lowe's. There he encourages co-worker, Ralphie (Michael Skourtis), to lose weight and move up the ladder by becoming a security guard. After work the McCall visits a local diner to eat, read, and occasionally discuss life, calmly extolling the virtues of self- discipline and healthy eating. There, we see also that he has become a genuine friend to a young working girl, Alina (Cloe Grace Moretz). She asks questions about the book he reads and looks troubled. In the first act we often wonder when McCall will show his aces. Washington's nice guy character is introduced as quite passive and slow moving, as it moves through several relationships with increasing drama and tension. This reaches a peak when he confronts the Russian mob, who have beat the living crap out of Alina. McCall has come to the mob's restaurant to buy Alina her freedom, making an offer the boss, Slavi (David Meunier), instantly mocks and refuses. Here, finally, we see McCall as the bad ass MF we have been impatiently expecting. The camera and special effects go into high gear revealing him to be a calculating, superhuman fighter who swiftly dispenses the heavily armed Russians in an incredibly bloody and violent encounter. Now the die is cast, pitting McCall against the big Russian mob boss, Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich), who must retaliate and kill him. To do this he employs Teddy, aka Nicolai (Martin Csokas), his best and most ruthless lieutenant. Working with corrupt cops Teddy methodically tracks down McCall, hurting or killing anyone who gets in his way. Meanwhile, more is revealed about McCall's past, when he meets with mysterious (CIA) characters who provide him with information and tools he requires to deal with the Russian mob.This version of the Equalizer is quite compelling as was the original. There are few of us who have not wanted an equalizer in our lives to deal with an actual bully, predator, or obnoxious asshole who seem beyond the reach of 'justice.' This is about a primal as it gets when you find yourself as as a victim with no defense. So rooting for McCall is a piece of cake, no matter how much violence he spawns, and very uplifting, potentially. Alas, this fantasy ends when we leave the theater, but maybe not, if we keep wishing harder!",9,0,1,21 November 2014
Interstellar," From dust bowls, to wormholes, to black holes and beyond.
","The set-up:It is the near future. The earth is drying up. Widower Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), former astronaut cum corn grower and his family watch their vast crop slowly wither. His family, including father-in-law (John Lithgow) and two kids worry about a very bleak future. What to do?One day Cooper drives his large, tandem wheeled pickup into a remote corner of the cornfield and stumbles upon a secret government installation. He goes inside and meets the eminent astrophysicist, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who thinks very big indeed. To save humanity, Brand and his team are searching for a habitable planet. But none are close by, as in thousands of light years distant. What to do?No problem, says the professor. I've checked and rechecked my equations! And, by the way, there are eleven other expeditions already out there. We need to see who among them has succeeded. To span the great distance in a reasonable time, you will traverse a wormhole. And, conveniently, there just happens to be one not too far away. But, says the professor, we need an experienced pilot like you to lead the mission. What to do?A devoted father, Cooper is torn by this opportunity, not wanting his kids to feel abandoned. But to save humanity, he'll go, and vows to return, placating himself if not the kids.Lift off: Cooper and crew, including (surprise) the professor's beautiful daughter, Dr. Brand (Anne Hathaway,) begin a long and dangerous interstellar adventure... Back on earth his kids, true to form, begin to wonder whether he has abandoned them. What happens next? Lots of suspense, astronaut jargon and cgi that will entertain most, at least at first. But this space ride has just begun, and the story, hinging on rather abstract astrophysical theory, may be become just a tad difficult to fathom, unless you've been to Cal Tech summer camp. But let's suppose you don't care about understanding the story and simply enjoy immersion in the mystery of cool science and thrill of a great movie ride in space. So, you sit tight and go through the wormhole, sweating the experience alongside Cooper and Dr. Brand. And, beyond. Although still very cool, suspenseful and thrilling, you are now in for a long. long ride.The producers, writers, actors and others have invested considerable creative energy, time, and money in making this movie, paying special attention to getting the space physics right, but perhaps at the expense of something far more basic: getting the movie physics right. An enjoyable three hour movie requires a cosmic leap in attention span, especially when combined with a complicated story line. So, one of two experiences await you: clever, cosmic yarn or deep space yawn.Unfortunately, to find out, you will have to see the movie. Bon voyage!",6,2,4,7 January 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Another Wes Anderson Adult Fairy Tale
","Once upon a time, in a place named after a rather tasty, flavored Polish vodka, there was a great hotel and an even greater concierge. Therein lies a cleverly conceived story within a story, which touches humorously, and occasionally darkly, upon almost every human emotion. Notable among these are love, lust, greed, fear, happy, sad, silly, and, of course, mad. We connect with these emotions mainly through the exploits of the main character, M. Gustave, the impeccably correct, near perfect concierge played by Ralph Fienes and his able, young protégé, Zero, played by Tony Revolori. Their acting is superb, aided by (usually) very well crafted screen writing,and story telling But there's more. The movie includes a veritable menagerie of wacky characters, many from the Anderson stable, and others, all of whom perform well. If you're an Anderson fan, the movie is a must see. If not, despite the fine acting and writing, and sets, the story could become a little tedious. But, should that be the case, you are urged to sit through the movie trailer, and its fascinating balalaika music, which will make all but the most sleepy person wake-up and feel good, before leaving the theater. Also, to celebrate your experience and if you like vodka, try to find Zubrowka (pronounced zha-broof-ka), and see what buffalo grass tastes like...I am convinced this movie was fun to make, and and should be fun to watch for all but the most literal minded and sober viewer.",8,1,4,19 May 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Bared man screeches for birdseed, gets pecked instead.
","Fine actors, intense performances, set in a classic Broadway theater, together with very clever camera work and a fractured storyline, all come together to produce a 'masterpiece' of cinematic cacophony. Meaning an extremely harsh, discordant mixture of sights and sounds. From the opening credits, a drummer (think of an eleven year old in the garage with a new drum set) bangs away, insuring a certain amount of distraction no matter what you think of the movie...So, we meet Riggan (MIchael Keaton), a very successful Hollywood super hero (Birdman) who has come to NYC to direct and act in his own Broadway play. He has great hopes, but pulling this off will not be easy. His wide-eyed, bratty daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), just out of rehab, lurks in the wings and does her best to remind him of his shortcomings, as well as flirt with Mike (Edward Norton), the play's obnoxious male lead. Riggan's girlfriend, Laura (Andrea Riseborough), does not feel loved, and wants more attention. And, here are others sapping Riggan of what energy he has left, and we wonder how will he survive, let alone open a successful play. But Riggan has something of an ace up his sleeve; he possesses special powers. Think moving things at a distance as in telekinesis. We see this power whenever he is angry and he uses it to destroy things in his office. Think also of defying gravity. In the beginning we see Riggan sitting in air, perhaps meditating on the challenge before him. What else might Riggan be able to do? The answer more or less allows the story to reach a conclusion, sort of.Never mind the fractured story line, and din of the drums, the main problem with this movie is the difficulty in liking anyone. For me, the one scene worth seeing again is the bar confrontation between the NYT critic, Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan) and Riggan. Don't get up and leave until you see it. You just might get behind Riggan after he rebuts her major put down of him and his play.But don't bet on it! Masterpiece? I think not. More, missed a piece!",4,7,18,5 January 2015
