The Blair Witch Project," Chilling
","The title describes the whole film. It may be poorly lit, bad shot with bad cinematography, but that's what makes it stand out and realistic. Even though, it isn't but at one point of time, we used to feel it, and our night got disturbed. The fact that we don't no what's going on, makes it more scary. The people complaining on being disappointed, were expecting a commercial horror with jump scares. But this movies created a whole new genre and inspired many independent directors. While the story is bland and nothing new, it still manages to scare us. Kudos to the makers for this",8,0,2,25 April 2020
The Ring," A bunch of scary scenes, that's it

John Wick," Must watch for Action fans
","So Keenu Reaves is back with an action flick, John Wick and tbh, it delivered us what was it meant to be. The action sequences, dialogues are especially the cinematography is excellent and attract the viewers. The only con i see is the lack of acting skills.While Keanu Reaves is a good action hero, but he is a little weak in acting. Also, except for few, the other characters too disappointed us with their cringy acting. Nevertheless, it's a great action thriller movie, if you're interested in this genre",8,1,2,8 December 2019
Fight Club," First rule : Don't talk about Fight Club
","What to say? This movie was so relatable to my daily lives that i just loved it. The narrator suffers the same problems like me, suffeeing in this capitalist world, buying things we don't need. And eventually the things we own end up owning us.As a solution, the narrator develops another personality, Tyler Durden, which is his dream personality. The narrator wants to be like Tyler i.e. cool, awesome and not shy to express his feelings but couldn't do so coz of the fear of this damn society. And this is probably one of the biggest plot twists of all time. The story is interesting and gripping and you'll surely relate to it. Both Brad Pitt and Edward Nortan has done great acting.Now, talking about the cons, the fight scenes should be longer and the ending seems incomplete or empty to me. But overall, Fight club is worth watching..:)",8,0,0,25 December 2019
Memento," A portrait of memories of our life
","Memento is undoubtedly one of Christopher Nolan's best movie of his career. Though, it is not a commercial movie as it doesn't falls in the mainstream cinema.Still it manages to influence us.The plot revolves around a guy named Leonard Shelby or Lenny (Guy Pearce) who suffers from amnesia and tries to find the person who raped and killed his wife. He just can't make new memories. So, he uses notes, tattoos and Polaroid cameras to make new memories. One thing is that, the story runs backwards, jumping back and forth after every scene, which creates a suspense. Guy pearce has done a good acting, neither too bland nor too overreacting.The problem with it is that, it couldn't explain how can he remember that he is amnesiac. It's a major plot hole. Also, the suspense created doesn't result in some extraordinary or satisfying result.",9,3,4,2 January 2020
The Babadook," Above Average Horror Movie
","The Babadook is a 2014 Australian horror movie about a single mother and his son who starts having illusions about a monster Mister Babadook, which is released from a cursed Book. Considering it's low budget it is pretty good in terms of scares and definitely much better than other cringy moden horror movies.So, actually Amelia lost her husband in a car accident while the delivery of his son, Samuel. That's why she regrets that day and had never celebrated her son's b'day because her dad died the same day. This results in the tensions and bad relationship b/w Amelia and her son. Here Babadook is the metaphor for Amelia's suffering and grief. Because of this grief, she didn't take care of her son properly. This grief increased so much that she became possessed by her own tensions and turned crazy. At last, she accepted her fate and overcame her emotions. And she finally moved on. Due to this, Babadook became weak and became their pet.Overall, due to the acting and cinematography, it manages to scare us, but not as much as the critics say",7,3,4,10 January 2020
Alien," A true classic sci fi horror
","Alien (1979) may be more than 40 yr old movie but it surpasses the modern movies in almost every way. The actors are smart and they act realistically, not like the stupid actors of today. The Bgm, the sound effects and the cinematography make the atmosphere isolated af which makes a scene very terrifying. Now I understand why so many people praise this. It's a true classic movie overall. A MUST WATCH",10,0,1,9 March 2020
Interstellar," One of the most special movies of my Life
","Interstellar is a very deep, confusing but emotional film. The acting of Matheww Mcconaughey and the music is very emotional. The music and the ending lefts you emotional and with a message to save the Earth",10,2,4,31 October 2019
Bird Box," An Entertaining Thriller with a Disappointing ending...
","Bird box was one of the most hyped netflix movies of 2018. And tbh, it does deserve that. It's an entertaining and creepy thriller that pulls you at the edge of your seats, wondering what would happen next.But there's one thing that left me and I guess, most of the viewers disappointed i.e. THE ENDING. In the novel, the ending was darker and tbh much realistic and accepting
But, in the novie the director decided to show us an optimistic or so called HAPPY ENDING and that ruined all the efforts. Especially, I was disappointed that they did'nt show the monsters or the forces that were making the people psychotic and murderers. I waited too long for the monsters and their purpose. All these things are not clear. But anyways, it was a good watch, if you're into a gripping thriller genre.",7,1,2,26 October 2019
Split," Good. But dont watch if you haven't seen it's prequel
","It's overall an decent thriller. Despite being a PG13 movie, it still manages to scare us. James McAnvoy's acting is at it's best. Only one thing. Don't watch if you haven't seen the prequel movie named, 'Unbreakable'. Otherwise you'll not be able to understand it",7,0,0,11 December 2019
The Machinist," Acting and suspense at it's best
","Christian Bale is such an outstanding actor. He totally nailed in the role of Trevor in this movie. He lost 28 kgs for this movie, which is indeed not an easy thing. The Machinist is a psychological thriller about a man who suffers from insomnia and haven't slept for years. That's why he suffers hallucinations and become a killer.The suspense is built up well in this movie and we wonder what the hell is happening. Despite some similarities from Fight Club and Memento, it still manages to be honest and orignal. It's an excellent thriller movie if you're onto this genre",9,0,2,12 December 2019
Aliens," One of the best classic action movie
","Aliens is indeed a great sequel, which can be compared to it's prequel Alien (1979), unlike the sequels made these days. However tbh, it's not fair to compare them coz they are both good in their respective genres. Alien is a sci fi horror, while Aliens is an action-adventure thriller movie. And both did great jobs. James cameron has once again proved that he is the master of sci fi and action movies and his movies are a visual treat too.Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) carries the film on her shoulders. She emerged as an Queen of Sci fi from these movies. Anyways i didn't find any flaw in any department, whether it be logic, directon, cinematography, VFX, action and anything else. So, for me it's easily an 10/10",10,0,0,15 March 2020
It Follows," Expected a scary horror flick, got creepy thriller instead
","It follows is definitely disturbing and chilling movie, but sorry to say that it doesn't seem scary. So, I guess most of us expecting usual jump scares would be disappointed. Also, it isn't as good as the critics say, it has the flaws too. So, calling it the best modern horror movie or even the best horror film of the decade (Ah yes, a critic thinks so..xD) would be a shame to this genre. So, why are the critics overwhelmed.Is it coz of it's orignality? No, It's because they think that the demons represent STD and the movie would spread awareness against it( Lmao...but to me,STDs seems to be sexually transmitted demons.xD)So, the movie is about a demon whose curse is transferred from one person to other while sexual intercourse. Due to this, the main protagonist girl is affected as his boyfriend transferred it to her and now it'll follow her. Tbh, the acting in this movie is pretty bad, except for Jay (the main girl). That's why we can't feel them. Nevertheless, the cinematography, screenplay and Background score succeds to build a tense and creepy atmosphere which saves the movie.Now, a theory is very popular which changes the whole perspective of the movie. It says that the children in this movie are picked from different timelines and don't have any parents, as we couldn't see them in the movie. Instead they are raised by different demons in hell. Yeah, they are living in hell.
Overall, it is a good one time watch, but definitely not a game changer or masterpiece as many would say.",7,0,0,9 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Long, boring and pointless
","I don't understand the hype. This movie was so bland and dull that i can't trust Tarantino anymore. The only movie of him that i liked was Inglorious Basterds. Other than that, almost all were mediocre, but still watchable. But, tbh this may be his worst movie. It's style over substance. It's dragged for 160 mins (more than 2.5hr) and we wait for nothing.So, I went last night with my Grandpa, as he was amazed to see the movie, out of nostalgia. He did enjoy it, as he found many things relatable. I too believed in the hype and big star cast(DiCaprio, Brad pitt, Margot Robbie). But, meh my money got wasted. Brad Pitt is the only one who carries the film on his shoulders. Although, I'm a big fan of DiCaprio, he sucks in this movie. His role was meaningless. The whole movie you'll get cultural and pop references to the 60s era and most of them were accurate but the problem is that the pace is too slow to keep up with the story, which itself is crap. This follows the traditional style of AMERICAN STEREOTYPE, by showing asians in bad light. That bruce lee x brad pitt fight scene literally irritated me. At least show some respect to him. As per tarantino, every american is strong, powerful and messiah and asians are dumb, crap and freaks. I literally got irritated and bored, until the ending came, with traditional Tarantino style action fighting, the thing most of the people in the theater were waiting for.Anyways, one star coz my Grandpa enjoyed it and one star for the ending.",3,2,5,24 February 2020
Get Out," More of a thriller than a horror
","Get out is not a horror movie. Don't be misleaded. It's more of a satirical thriller movie. But sometimes things seems forced. But overall Daniel Kaluyya saves the film, and I must say IT IS ONE OF THE SMARTEST THRILLER MOVIES EVER MADE",7,1,3,28 February 2020
Children of Men," A dystopian Nightmare..
","Children of men is a well written and directed dystopian drama film that surely lives upto expectations. The actors have done good job and cinematography is excellent. It feels that you're actually experiencing a dystopian future society of Britain.The story revolves about how in a totalitarian Britain of the future, the govt has applied infertility law all over the country and how immigrants are tortured. After all these, a black girl miraculously gets preganat and the story revolves around her and her baby. Despite, sometimes it could be felt that more thrill could be added. Nevertheless, it is a good one time watch. If you're a man of Alfonso Curran movies, then you'll love it..",8,1,1,7 December 2019
Saw," Torture porn? Well, not exactly...:(
","Saw (2004) is one of those movies infamous for it's bloody violent and gory theme. Sometimes often referred to as 'torture'. Well, it indeed it is, but not exactly.So, most of you must have known the plot by now. So, I'll tell in short. Two strangers woke up in a toilet, who later find themselves as the part of a deadly game by a psycho named 'Jigsaw' who is actually a very clever. He didn't directly kills his victims but sets deadly traps instead. His philosophy is simple, those who don't value life, either of themselves or others, must be taught a lesson. Now the movie is low budget so some cheap computer effects can be ignored (especially that car chase scene). Otherwise, the cinematography is watchable. Acting is good too. But Idk why i felt somewhat bland after watching it. Maybe I expected more violence and gore or maybe the critics had created way too much hype. Nevertheless, it isn't torture but indeed, is disgusting and disturbing. And pls don't call it a horror movie.",7,0,0,7 February 2020
A Clockwork Orange," One of Kubrick's best
","A clockwork orange is one of the best psychological adventure thriller i've ever watched. But it's not ur usual type film. We see this film through the antagonist Alex De Large's perspective. He is a boy who rapes and does violent beatings for fun. Coz he doesn't sees the world like us. The excellent acting of Malcom McDowell (Alex De Large) and the direction of Kubrick makes it worth watching.It has a lot of hidden meanings in it, which i'll not reveal now coz it's a spoiler free review. The language used here is a mixture of Old english, russian and greek to generate interest in the audience to know deeper about the antagonist. So, do keep a dictionary while watching it:D. Anyways, overall it is ahead of it's time and deserved more oscars. Perhaps at that time, people couldn't understand the film.",10,0,0,7 January 2020
Eyes Wide Shut," Most underrated Kubrick film
","Although the title is 'Eyes wide shut', when watching this film, you have to keep your eyes wide open. This film is base on the novella (Traumnovelle) (Dream Story), written by Arthur Schnitzler, who Freud claimed had such an intimate affinity with. Kubrick had spent decades of time adapted the novella to the motion picture. With joint effort of two greatest minds, the film is among the most profound ones, so that requires great effort to interpret. In the very beginning of the film, Bill walked from the living room, through the bedroom, towards bathroom. This move provides us a clear establishment inside this New York couple's house. The view is clearly described by Tim Kreider as, 'The paintings that cover the Harfords' walls from floor to ceiling (painted by Kubrick's wife Christiane) almost all depict flowers or food, making explicit the function of art in their environment as mere decor-art for consumption.' Then followed, Alice, who just finished using the bathroom stand up, made her first frontal appearance. This obvious continuity between the paintings and Alice, combining the starting scene which displayed her naked back, implied that our main female character was also an art work that the main male character had collected. When Alice asked Bill why he wasn't jealous, the answer Bill gave is 'Because you are my wife and the mother of my child.' What he had in mind was that Alice was something he owned rather than the person he shared a life with. Alice talked about her fantasy to Bill that she was ready to give up every thing, including her family and her child just because of the glance of the naval officer. She was saying that in order to protest the Bill's ownership. This revealed more of the submissive position where Alice stood --- Always leading by the male. Her appearance was always associated with the mirror. As analysis in Lacan's theory:'The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body image' Alice constantly behavior of checking the mirror indicates of her loss of self-identification. She was familiar with being a wife and a mother---the ego characteristics required by the society. Alice looked like a serious person, wearing glasses, hardly smile. Not until she was on alcohol, pot or during dreaming, did the relax expression appeared on her face. From this we would know she repressed lots of her own desires, hide the tension, the anxiety deep down, so as to meet the demand of her husband and the society. However, when she was unconscious, she couldn't control of the desires and just let it out. The night, Bill came home from the orgy party, found her giggling during her sleep. But when woke up, she look very terrified. The transition from sleep to awaken is analog with the transition form unconscious to conscious. The four step of dream interpretation 'secondary revision' could be applied to the dramatic attitude changing from being satisfied to being terrified. She feels guilty about dream cheating of her husband so she forced herself as remembering the dream as a horrific nightmare.Bill maintained his dominant poison, identified himself as the role of the saver, using money to control people such as costume shop owner, the taxi driver and ultimately since he was the only financial support of the family, using money to control Alice. When he wanted to do something that considered as immoral or transgression, he start to searching through the unconscious to find the excuses to keep him away from being guilty. The fantasies of his wife making love with the naval officer occurring three times, each followed by the action of searching other women to fulfill his sexual needs, hooking up with the prostitute, calling his late patient's daughter who expressed her desires for him before and going to the orgy party. He needed the reason for the self gratification. And the idea of revenge to his wife's fantasized infidelity severed him well. From this we can indicate that Bill indeed is a very hypocritical person. He spared no effort finding ways to satisfy his id desires while his wife Alice tried really hard to repress it. I think the scene which he found that the mask lying on his pillow implied that he, not his wife, is the person who cheated and disguised as an honest man. Every detail in this film is carefully designed. The name of prostitute the 'domino' is actually a kind of mask, which predicted the following masque in held in the Somerton. The password of the party is 'Fidelio', which was the Italian for faithful. It's severs as an irony because using such word as engaging into an orgy. Also, Fidelio is Beethoven' opera telling the story of how a wife risked her life to save her husband in prison from death. It predicted the result that in the end Mandy sacrificed herself to protect Bill's life. It also was using stairs as a metaphor for social class and the dirt inside the upper ones. The higher you climb, the more bodies you might discovered in their closets. Just as the saying goes: 'There is nothing accidental in Kubrick's film.' Because of the films contains numerous hidden meanings and great complexity. People who watch the film at the first time often found it very confusing. Also, during the promotion, it marketed as an erotic thriller, therefore, for people who just want to watch celebrities couple having hot steamy sex on screen would be really disappointed. It's much more sophisticated and you would notice something new when you watch it again and again.
Overall, it isn't a mainstream movie so some of you may not enjoy it. But real cinema fans will definitely like it. It has a very deep message though",8,1,1,9 January 2020
Pulp Fiction," Overrated as hell
","This movie is certainly one of the most over hyped movie i've ever seen. It has nothing orignal. It is copied from the western action movies from 60s and 70s. And people are praising Tarantino, calling him genius. Well, he certainly reincarnated the genre, but he hasn't done anything creative except for the bible reference. So, where is the imagination?.What are the people getting excited for?Now, talking about the story, it doesn't have one. Yes it has 3. These three short stories are somewhat connected to each other by a character named Marsellus Wallace, whom you can call the villain of the movie. But the problem is that neither these stories are interesting nor they create any surprise when they meet. Though I liked the one that features Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta. These too literally nailed their role. I enjoyed their chemistry very much. Especially Samuel L Jackson has done a natural act. Other than that, there's nothing except for violence, gore (Tbh I like them, but here it was not satisfactory) and biblical refrences. Also it really hurts that a great movie THE SHAWSANK REDEMPTION lost to this one at the box office. It is really shameful. Biblical references are also there in TSR and they are for a reason.Anyways, if you want to waste two and half hours of your life just for watching some stupid philosophical action movie, then watch it..",3,2,10,30 December 2019
The Da Vinci Code," Disappointed
","I had a lot of expectations from this movie but it ended by being a big disappointment. Tom Hanks and the French girl were so dull and bland that I cringed hard whenever they had a convo. I thought it would be a good mystery film but ended by being a slow, boring and stupid movie. 5 stars only for the story by Dan Brown",5,1,1,3 March 2020
Titanic," Exceptional and Heartwarming Classic
","Titanic is one of my favourite. Definitely not because of Jack and Rose's boring romance and blah blah blah.But due to the emotional and disastrous effect it made. It could be even better if the romance sequences were cut short.Nevertheless, its one of those classic movies not to be missed.",10,1,1,23 November 2018
Rosemary's Baby," Mediocre
","It's a watchable but stupid classic movie. The acting and expressions of Rosemary is excellent and the atmosphere gives you chills and suspense but her stupidity disappoints us. It's the first Roman Polanski's movie i've watched and it's really great in technical departments such as cinematography, camera angles, music and directon. But when it comes to screenplay, it's really stupid and idiotic. First of all, where tf are the police and why Rosemary isn't calling them, when they find something suspicious. Also, in the ending when she finds out that the real father of his son was satan, then her reaction is laughable. It's like nothing happened and she blindly accepts the baby. Idk why some people find it acceptable. These are some stupid stuff bout the movie.",6,0,4,25 March 2020
Joker," A true masterpiece
","Joker is one of the best movie i've seen in 2019. The acting of Joaquin Phoenix is top class and of next level. He steals the show. He has buried himself deeper into the character. So much that it looks even more real than the Joker itself(Lmao, but serious ly). This movie also rasies a question that should rebel be considered as a crime?Watch this masterpiece at least once in your life. It will surely change your view on a hero and a villian. A villan is not born bad but the environment he is raised in makes him do so....",10,4,7,28 November 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Surprisingly good, way underrated
","I get the impression that EDGE OF TOMORROW is a film that most people will forget ever existed within a year of it's release. Despite being a big budget sci-fi action film with Tom Cruise in the lead, this movie went almost completely ignored by audiences. Including me. Unfortunately, I paid no attention to this movie during its theatrical run and contributed to its depressingly low box office haul. It's a high concept sci-fi action that's well written and populated with a strong cast; it should've done better than it did to encourage more interesting films out of the studios. Based on a Japanese novel (that I've never read), the story follows Major Cage (Tom Cruise) in the midst of an alien invasion that has consumed Europe and threatens to soon spread across the rest of the globe. The aliens, dubbed Mimics, are an impossibly skilled species of killers that can seemingly predict humanity's every plan and prepare for it. Cage, an official with the military's public relations department, is assigned to be on the front line to record their invasion of Normandy for humanity's latest attempt, Operation: Downfall. Panicked, he tries to blackmail his way out and finds himself arrested and dropped on the front lines, no longer as a media specialist but as a deserter reassigned to an infantry unit. His first real taste of war ends as one would expect when he dies at the hands of one of the aliens' 'Alphas' but not before introducing it to the business end of a claymore mine. He dies, covered in the Alpha's blood, and finds himself awakening moments later at the start of the day, reliving events. Cage is now on an endless time loop of death on the frontlines and the only person who understands his plight is the 'Angel of Verdun', a celebrated soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt) who has experienced the same phenomenon.Tom Cruise once again proves that, while I'm baffled by his personal life, he is a solid actor. His character, Major Cage, has a full arc over the course of the film as he transforms from a cowardly media relations specialist into a killing machine who is willing to selflessly sacrifice himself if needed to end the Mimics' invasion. Despite Cruise's history of playing the near-invincible action hero, he is totally believable in the beginning of the film when Cage is so terrified of seeing combat that he's willing to attempt blackmail on a general. His counterpart in the film is Rita, played in a surprising turn by Emily Blunt. I'm only familiar with Blunt from comedies so her role of a decorated military alien murder machine is mind-blowing in how well she does. Blunt has gravitas and you never question her character's ability to slaughter hordes of enemies on the front lines. Best of all, the filmmakers never bother to cram a love story between Cage and Rita into the plot as most summer big-budget action movies would be prone to do. Cage and Rita keep their relationship professional (mostly) and keep their focus on winning the war. In order to defeat the Mimics, they will need to locate and destroy their Omega, an organism that essentially acts as the central brain for the species. Cage's ability to restart the day each time he dies comes from a direct connection to the Omega, so he is now humanity's final hope in defeating the alien threat.Overall, the film is surprisingly good. I didnt expect much from it but it resulted in a very interesting sci fi action flick. The use of time loop in this movie is the best i've ever seen in a film",9,1,1,2 January 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Entertaining but Pointless
","It is an entertaining and funny movie for a teen to hang with their friends. But truth is it is pointless. Everything happens with no logic, just as if earning money is too easy in this world.

Inception," A very interesting and clever sci fi flick
","Inception is one of my favorite movies of all times. Every time I watch it, it feels like i've discovered a new easter egg that i missed earlier. It plays with your mind, so much that you too gets confused whether the scene is dream or reality.Well Leonardo DiCaprio is great as always. But Marion Cortilard, the one who played Mal, who haunts him in his dreams has done a very impressive work. Though, the screenplay was almost flawless, the cinematography could've been better. It is one of the best and clever sci fi movies ever made",10,1,2,14 December 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Hands down to the best movie I've ever watched..
","What to say about this movie. I still regret not watching it after several recommendations. This is a complete masterpiece. All the actors have done great job.Now talking about the movie it has a very deep message. It says hope is the thing a man should always have. Fear can hold you a prisoner but hope can set you free. And being free doesn't mean freedom from prison, but from negative thoughts that brought you down here. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shared a great bond of throughout the movie and we really do care about them. It is a masterpiece and one must watch it at least once in his/her life....",10,1,1,3 December 2019
Parasite," No words
","Parasite is undoubtedly the best film of the decade and my 2nd favorite film. It's not as simple as it looks. It has hidden meanings and metaphors. The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the screenplay, all were excellent. I didn't see any flaws in them. Maybe, for the first time, a deserved movie won the oscar for best picture.So, the story is basically about how a poor family makes their way to become the servant of the rich family. Just like how a parasite attacks their host, they attack the rich's house. The whole film is filled with metaphors and easter eggs. You must watch at least 2 times to understand the hidden meaning. Well, even if it's in korean, the subs are okay and you can live up with em.The film tackle the class division with a satarical tone. It's a must watch",10,1,2,22 March 2020
Marriage Story," Meh...
","It's a good movie, which has it's ups and downs. Let's see the positive aspects (pros):-1) The acting is excellent. Both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson were amazing and realistic.
2)That argument scene b/w them and the courtroom scene, where the two lawyers argue were the best
3) It is quite relatable, especially for people like me, whose parents' relationships are not quite goodCONS:-
1) This film is too long or overstretched, slow and boring (except for few scenes)
2) The storyline is totally frustrating. Nicole turns out to be a b***h. She played with her husband's feelings. First, she didn't have sex with him for year, then when charlie sleeps with his co worker, she turns hyperactive, and hacks his computer. The lawyer she hires is also a b***h. Both of them plan a conspiracy to get the custody of the child. The social and emotional manipulation of the child is too annoying.
3) Charlie (Adam driver) is the one who has to suffer throughout. He did committed some mistakes, but his wife didn't even care to either have a discussion or come to an agreement. She simply plays with him. She forced him to move to LA. And the end, what he got, he lost his job in NYC, his company, his money, and most importantly, his child, coz he got only 45 per cent of custody, even through all his sacrifice. Ok, although this is just a story, but it hurts when people are dishonest and call the ending, beautiful and masterpiece. If, that's what american life is, then sorry it's quite weird and disturbing.
4) The law system is completely biased in the US. It's like favouring the women and bashing the men. When i googled it, i found each state has different law, which adds, why nicole moved to LA. It is both sad and laughable at the same time",4,1,1,2 May 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," A classic psychological thriller that lives upto expectations
","This movie is a great one time watch, even with a few flaws. It is about a FBI agent Clarice starling (Portrayed brillaintly by Jodie Foster), who is assigned to interview a psycopathic serial killer named Hannibal Lector, who steals the show. This character is brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins. He did a good job by portraying the ideology of Lector. The cinemaography is very good, according to it's decade.Now talking about the cons, I felt something missing at the end of the film. It just felt incomplete. Hannibal's character should have been given more time so we could understand his mind and principle. Another thing is that some more scenes should be shot of Clarice at Buffalo bill's house where she could've been abducted and torture to make the atmosphere more intense. Hope this was helpful for ya...",8,0,0,1 December 2019
Vanilla Sky," A Perfect Sci-fi Romance Movie
","Vanilla Sky is a very good sci-fi psychological romance movie. At first sight it might seem boring and usual romantic melodrama. But when you watch by OPENING YOUR EYES, it will become interesting. Tom Cruise's acting is very good and he has put emotions at right place.Just two cons are there:-1) As I said before, it might seem long and boring in the starting. The makers could have avoided cringe at the beginning.
2)The music is faboulus. But it might seem that some sort of music was not required in certain scenes as it seems overdramatic.Hope this review is helpful. Goodbye, We'll meet in next life, when we will be Cats...;)",8,2,4,28 October 2019
Fifty Shades of Grey," Fifty shades of GAY
","Horrible movie. I seriously curse myself for watching this garbage. There was nothing in this film. It's neither erotic, nor a feel good movie. It's more like a torture than a soft p*rn. There is no chemistry between the characters. Dakota Johnson is a pure product of nepotism and tbh she couldn't act. And as for the male lead, what can you expect from a model. Idk much bout BDSM but i hated the idea of torture for pleasure. And plus those users who had BDSM hated it too. The girl in this movie ( Dakota) is so stupid virgin and desperate bout sex that she even let him abuse her. Is this where humanity is going to? And the sad part is that some wannabe showgirls are getting kick out of it. Avoid this crap pls",1,1,3,3 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," It'll make you both laugh and cry
","Jojo rabbit is a post war satire about the Nazis, WWII and all those stuff, but presented in a comedic way. We follow Jojo, a boy who is a fanatical nazi and hates jews. One day, he finds a jew girl in his attic. How he deals with the situation, will he follow his fanatical way or will he show humanity. That's the plot summed up.Now, the theme is pretty interesting. I've seen a lot of movies based on nazis like the inglorious basterds, Schindler's list, Downfall, etc..but this is probably the first family nazi movie..lol. It'll make you laugh in the first half and cry in the second. It's full of emotions. We also get to see the nazi perspective and their hatred. A must watch.",9,1,2,30 January 2020
The Sixth Sense," Okay i didn't see that coming
","Tbh, this film has the best plot twist i've ever seen. It changes everything. It changes our whole perspective. Although, Bruce willis has done a great acting, Cole (the kid) steals the show. His expressions and emotions at such a young age looks amazing. The only flaw i noticed is that the film is slow. It only generates interest from the 2nd half. It also sends us a secret message on child abuse, which was ignored by most of us. Nevertheless, the ending is one of the most beautiful endings i've ever seen. Although it's dark, it looks satisfying and that's the plus point. It's a must watch 90s movie, but don't expect a horror vibe or jump scare from this.",8,0,0,9 April 2020
Cloud Atlas," A wannabe cliche
","Don't know what to say bout this movie. I just regret wasting my 3hrs waiting for nothing. I'm not gonna write an explanation bout it coz it's not worth it. Just a quick review. So here six parallel stories are told, which are held in six different timeline but connected by some philosophical cliche. That's the reason why i dont like philosophical movies. They just try to build their agenda in your mind. You lose your imagination and feel as if the movie is feeding you the story and you've to bear it no matter whatever the hell it is. Didn't expected that from the Wachaoskis who made some good movies like The Matrix Triology and V for Vendetta. Can't understand what these so called smart ass audiences are getting excited about after seeeing the reviews. Pls avoid them.",1,2,6,31 January 2020
Cube," A maze with a greater purpose
","A maze of human emotionsCube is a sci fi horror film about six people trapped in a giant cube, with no recollection of how they got there. This movie eventually inspired many future movies like Saw and Escape roomNow talking bout the movie, it doesn't focuses on the purpose of the cube, who made it. Was it a psycho scientist, a govt conspiracy or aliens. Rather it focuses on how the tones of the characters change with time and their purpose. They think of passing only one thing i.e in front of them, which acts as a metaphor for human nature. Also, this movie seema anti capitalist and nihilistic, but manages to show it's perspective.Now the thing is that it isn't perfect. There are flaws too. Such as Leven often messes up with maths, ending up calling composite numbers prime (like, seriously they should've hired a math teacher or something). Also, it has various mathematical errors, which ruina the atmosphere. Second thing is that the characters felt too cringy and unpredictable and. Also, in the end the black guy appears suddenly from nowhere and attacks Leven, killing her, which doesn't makes any sense.Also, I was just curious of knowing what was out there like. Nevertheless the ending seemed perfect.",7,1,1,30 January 2020
