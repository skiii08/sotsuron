Million Dollar Arm," based on wrong country
","Definitely based in the wrong country..if he wanted fast bowlers, should have gone to Pakistan that has the most successful fast bowlers ever with likes of Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram and Shoaib Aktar to name a few. Even Australia with Bred Lee and historically West Indies with likes of Courtney Walsh would have been much better candidates. India has never produced a single good fast bowler...anyone close to cricket would know this... Now this movie based on bad decision from failing sports promoter gives this incorrect perception.Not a bad movie in terms of other emotions of the whole event. A bit shame of the way it tries to piggy bags on slum dog millionaire success.",1,1,27,24 August 2014
