It," Masterful!
",The cinematography alone blew me away! The young new actors were perfectly picked and Pennywise was creepy as hell! I love this movie. The most beautifully done horror film.,10,0,1,28 June 2019
Us," The actors were phenomenal but the plot was awful.
","I loved the movie 'Get Out,' so I had high expectations for this film. I was let down. The plot was not my favourite. I don't know what happened to Jordan's thought process on this film, but he choked. I didn't take the critics reviews in mind because I never do just so I can have an opinion myself. (Sigh) I genuinely wasted my money on buying this film. The actors did a beautiful job and followed Jordan's direction flawlessly, but I wanted to enjoy this film and had a hard time wanting to like it. I'm sorry, this film was a bust.",4,107,157,28 June 2019

",This trilogy was amazing. All the critics who tear apart films because they want it to be just like the original trilogy. It would be completely lame and boring if it were exactly like the other trilogies. I was hoping for Ben Solo aka Kylo Ren to finally come to his senses and be on Rey's side. I was incredibly bummed for his untimely death after they finally had that kiss I was waiting for! I was very pleased with this ending. I cried a few times towards the end. Watch it for yourself and make your own assessment. I read these reviews and did't trust any of them because are too hypercritical.,10,9,20,12 January 2020
