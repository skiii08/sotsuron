The Avengers," Spectacular Marvel Universe Superhrero Celluloid Crossover!
","OUR ONE GREAT concern about doing this review now, is that sending it to IMDb at this time may help in causing a crash of the Website. We had just seen it at a Suburban Chicago shopping center multiplex,and much to our delight, we found it to be very much more of a film than had been anticipated.BEING JUST A LITTLE long in the tooth, we cam well remember when Marvel Comics' title, THE AVENGERS, first hit the news stands. It was in July of 1963 and Superheroes were definitely 'in'; with their popularity swiftly rising during that period.ALTHOUGH THE GENRE was probably the most popular one in the comics field from those 2-3 years before the United States' involvement in World War II; beginning a gradual decline in the Post War years. Peacetime brought readers' interest in Westerns, Romance, Movie Tie-ins and 'Funny Animals', among others.THE GREAT COMREBACK of the cape & mask 'long underwear' characters was due to DC Comics' updating old favourites (The Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman) and to Stan Lee's introducing some new characters (Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Fantastic Four, Spioderman) and bringing back Sub-mariner, a new Human Torch* and, most importantly, Captain America! WELL NOW, INASMUCH as we are now close to being a half century beyond this 4 Colour Heroes Rennaissance, it stands to reason that a screen adaptation of the feature would look just a trifle different than a 1960's version. We are, after all, in another Century, a new Millennium.FOLLOWING A SERIES OF Summer Blockbusters, Marvel Productions & Paramount Pictures have perhaps, come up with a Blockbuster to end all Blockbusters.AS MUCH AS old timers, such as yours truly, may lament about certain departures from the original, wee must admit that if we had our way all the time, there would be no progress, in any field. Invention and advancement in medicine would be at a standstill. Tadio, television, space travel and mass communications would all be stuck in the doldrums. Instead of the Internet, we'd probably be using smoke signals.BUT STILL, WHY can't we still see Captain America with actual wings on his mask, Hawkeye wearing his unique mask and Thor sporting that Viking winged helmet? Is that asking too much? I mean, it was okay for Loki to model his helmet while sparring with old 'Goldilocks'; why can't Thor also wear his own headgear? We suppose that all is due to all of that revisionism that has gradually changed the story over a nearly 50 year period. It is almost like DC Comics' Earth One/Earth Two UIniverse. ON THE MUCH more positive side of things, the production team gave us a truly epic story; the sort that is on the grand scale of which this certainly deserves. It is the cinematic comic book equivalent of those great stories that Mr. Stan Lee presented to us; all continued for many issues.Indeed, this may well be the best superhero outing ever since the release of SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE in 1978.IN ADDITION TO the outstandingly portioned servings of great fx, the film manages to insert a great deal of the humor which Stan lee used on the printed page. Even a sort of self spoofing is in evidence, when Tony Stark ridicules Loki's rather stinted speech patterns with the remark; 'So what's this, Shakespeare in the Park?' ALL OF THIS begs the question: 'Since we now have Marvel's THE AVENGERS as a screen franchise, can DC Comics' JUSTICE LEAGUE OF America be far behind?NOTE:* It was Johnny Storm of the Fantastic Four who took over the title of 'The Human Torch.'",9,1,4,4 May 2012
Iron Man 3," How About a little Back to Basics!
","REMEMBERING THAT HUMOR has long been both an integral part as well as a sort of trademark of writer Stan Lee's work, the IRON MAN films certainly must rank high on the totem pole of comics to film adaptations. Added to this is the interpretation of the character by Mr. Robert Downey, Jr. and the wise cracking dialog between the principal characters, Downey and Miss Gwyneth Paltrow.AS FOR THE SPECIAL effects,. need we say more? The FX in the modern super hero flick are a given. Long before a patron plinks down the price of a ticket, he knows what to expect. He (or She) is never surprised with the smörgåsbord of explosions, car chases, gun battles and general mayhem that unfolds several times during a two hour feature. As Stan Lee would say, ''Nuff said.' NOT SURPRISINGLY OUR main criticism of IRON MAN 3 involves what we like to refer to this pandemic of 'Creeping Revisionism' on the part of so many of these screenwriters. Whereas, we certainly do not expect that a scribe who's worth his weight in Golden Age Comics should or would just rewrite the same old stuff over and over again! What'd be the point?BUT THE BASIS of any updating should not violate. For example: in BATMAN (1989) the Joker is named as the killer* of Bruce Wayne's parents and the Joker is killed off at films end.** In SPIDERMAN, Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) displays some sort of mutation in the wrists that shoots the spider webs; whereas that 'power' had always been the result of some sort of 'wrist squirt guns'; which dispatched webs of a type of super strong latex (or something).THIS PASSION FOR rewriting is most evident is one aspect of IRON MAN 3. That is their treatment and handling of the character of The Mandarin.WE RECALL THE origin of the feud between Tony Stark's alter ego and this rogue Chinese Warlord. To begin with, the Mandarin was obviously a sort of knock off of Sax Rohmer's DR. FU MANCHU; being a 'Roadshow' Fu Manchu, if you will. That would also put him on the same family tree with Alex Raymond's villain, Emperor Ming (the Merciless) in FLASH GORDON.WHAT WE GET instead is a sort of comics hybrid between the real Mandarin and Hosama Bin Laden. Add to that a voice that has the accent of some 'Good Old Boy.' The ultimate misuse of literary license is in making the Mandarin a sham, a phony front man for the true villain, (Guy Pearce).OTHER THAN THAT, we view the big action scenes in most of these Super Hero Epics as looking increasingly like the electronic games, which they've spawned. Anyway, the line between the two becomes more and more blurred.NOTE * Any Batman fan knows that the true killer was Joe Chill, a low level street thug & stick up man.NOTE: ** The process of Joker's dying is repeated in DARK KNIGHT; leaving one to conclude that the Batman Franchise is turning into SOUTH PARK.",7,1,2,15 May 2013
Spartacus," Mirroring The Brutality Of Today's Post 9/11 World
","WE CONFESS TO being awfully ignorant, but, up until several years ago, we did not know that there was a real life Spartacus; who did lead a revolt of slaves in the Roman Empire. The years in question were 73- 71 B.C., and we read this was the 3rd and last of what have been called THE ROMAN SERVILLE WARS.THE STORY IS a natural subject for a Big Screen, Sword & Sandal epic and also a most desirable role for Executive Producer, Mr. Kirk Douglas to portray. Being what we now call a 'Blockbuster', the procuring of a top rate, international cast was in order.IN RESPONSE TO this need we have: Lawrence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis,Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, John Ireland, Nina Foch and Herbert Lom. Rounding out the players' roster are some very talented people; who are perhaps appearing in what may have been their most visible roles. Charles McGraw and Harold J. Stone come to mind and are excellent in their portrayals of brutal Trainer and Slave/Gladiator, respectively.IN CONSIDERING THE screenplay for this huge undertaking, the choice of Exec Producer was Dalton Trumbo. Although the writer had been blacklisted following the House Un-American Activities Committee's hearings for Leftist political leanings, he had continued to work; albeit with the use of Pen Names. Kirk Douglas insisted that he use his real name in the credits.* BECAUSE SO LITTLE is known about the events of that era, the personal lives of those involved and the political climate of Rome, a lot of filling in with supposition and fictionalization was called for.AS WITH SO many other story lines, it became a sort of surrogate morality play for us in the modern world. The behind the scenes conniving in the Roman Senate and the arrogance displayed by the military could all be easily portrayed as pariahs of the United States in the mid 20th Century.THE BEST EXAMPLES of this last hypothesis are the characters of Crassus (Olivier) in the military and Gracchus (Laughton) in the Senate. Mr.Laughton's characterization, in particular seems to be carefully crafted to be representative of a sort of caricature of what we think of as being a 'Politician' in the worst sense. He makes a beauty of a point in the money statement to support our case.MR. CHARLES LAUGHTON, as Senator Gracchus, states that privately he believes in none of these gods; but publicly he worships them all.NOW THEN, AIN'T that a 'Politician' for you? NOTE * Contrary to a widespread misconception, the 'Blacklist' was not a governmental edict; but rather a creation of a consortium of the Hollywood Studio Big Wigs.",10,0,1,25 June 2014
Casablanca," Universally Loved Film, Rated at Top of American Films! (whisper) And, don't tell the Guys; but it has all the markings of a 'Woman's Picture'!
","Well now, let's begin at the beginning, for what do we say about this most favourtie all time Romance-Adventure that hasn't been said already? It seems that just about everyone has this at or near the top of their own list of films to own and watch over, now and again. And any commentary mad is complicated by the multi-plane storyline. On a seemingly lightweight amusement level, we have the story of a highly unique Night Club, 'Rick's Café Americaine.' It is owned and operated by the expatriate American, one Richard Blaine (Bogart). The Club owes its large and loyal crowd of supporters to the American Style of Music provided by the Orchestra, particularly by the Black American Pianist, Sam (Dooley Wilson). All would appear to be a fine, relaxing and enjoyable to pass some leisure time and forget one's mundane existence, even for a little while.But the Café is in the city of Casablanca, the principal city of Morocco, then a French Colony, in North Africa. Along with Tunisia, Algeria and French West Africa, Morocco formed a huge, contiguous French land mass which would be in control of the Vichy French Government. The what, I hear out there?Following the defeat of France and their surrender to Hitler, the Country was partitioned. The Northern part was designated as being Occupied France, being completely run from Berlin by Hitler. The Southern portion of the Country was designated as 'Unoccupied France' and was allegedly free and independent. But it was proved to be anything but free and certainly not independent. It was headed up by the World War I Military hero; Marshal Petain (now considered to be a stone traitor). The new government was headquartered in the City of Vichy; hence, the term Vichy France or Vichy French. With all of that business attended to, we can now get on to CASABLANCA.OUR STORY..As we enter into the story, we find that the city of Casablanca is over-run with all ethnicities of Refugee people caught up in the Never-Never Land of the Post 1940 French era. All of this occurs after the Fall of France and their surrender to Nazi Germany. That subject matter alone would certainly be enough to give more substance (or even 'gravitas' *) to the story.That Casablanca had become a terminal for the unfortunate, but seemingly all Bourgeois Refugees, is a fact that turns its already Local Prefect of Police into more than his self- description as being 'a Poor, Corrupt Official.' As in any such degrading, seemingly hopeless situation, we see the heroic and the despicable side of humanity; one offering comfort and aid to those in need, the other feeding on their misery. In contrast to those who would flee, we have those who fight to make things better, the 'Underground' movement. They are in evidence in the city, and hail from everywhere in war-torn Europe. All it seems are present in 'Rick's'. The initial important events of the story are revealed rapidly, which might leave on without the realization of their effect on the rest of the story. First, we see the Police Radio Operator and hear the All-Call bulletin reporting the murder and robbery of two German Couriers on board the Train from Oran to Casablanca. The other is the arrival of special German Envoy, Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt) and his staff. The Double Homicide-Robbery was of interest, but mainly they are there to apprehend one Victor Laszlo ( Paul Henreid ), a fugitive from the Nazi Concentration Camps and Leader of the Czechoslovakian Underground.The Stolen Documents, '2 letters of transit, signed by General DeGaulle', are given to Rick by the perpetrator, one Monsieur Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Ugarte is arrested and killed by either the Casablancan Police or by Major Strasser's men, it's not clear whom. From then on it's all a matter of hunting the Letters, evading the Nazis and trying to figure out just who is the most treacherous; Monsieur Renault (Claude Rains), the Police Captain or Signore Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet),the self-proclaimed 'leader of all illegal activity in Casablanca.We also learn that even those who are less than virtuous can be Heroic and even Patriotic. That applies to even 'just a poor corrupt Public Official'.NOTE: * Boy, I've wanted to use that word 'GRAVITAS' ever since all of those news pundits said that V.P. Dick Cheney had it. I think he's still got a touch of it!",10,2,5,8 December 2007
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An Immense Cinamatic Feast for the Eyes, The Ears, The Heart and the Funnybone! We've Not Seen Its Likes Before!
","Bobs Hoskins,Christopher Lloyd,Joanna Cassidy,CharlesFleischer, Stubby Kaye,Alan Tilvern and a super multitude of Voice Actors, Artists and Technicians.Directed by Robert Zemeckis Lord! What a crazy premise for a film!When we were kids, we often asked some of the most outlandish questions, like: Who's stronger, Superman or Captain Marvel? Who'd win in a fight, King Kong or Mighty Joe Young? Did Adam and Eve have Belly Buttons? Kids don't realize that different characters belong to different companies and couldn't and wouldn't appear together, or would they?Director Zemeckis, Author Gary K. Wolf and the immense crew, all try to ask and answer a similarly 'impossible' situational occurrence. Just what if all of Hollywood's animated Cartoon characters were really live creatures called 'Toons', and what would happen if they had scandals like their human counterparts?Our old suspension of disbelief is supposed to bring us to a Post World War II Hollywood, where we find that the animated cartoon characters that we know from the local movie house, are really living, breathing creatures! Well, after e see the opening, Director Robert Zemeckis has us won over to his side.Private Investigator, Eddie Valiant, is summoned by Movie Mogul R.K. Maroon to his Studio to take a job. Because the subject of the case is their Star Cartoon Character, Roger Rabbit, the Detective balks at accepting the assignment because, 'I don't work for Toons!'(A Toon being one of these 'living' cartoon characters.)The economic situation at The Valiant Detective Agency dictates otherwise and Eddie is off. The Game's afoot!As the story unfolds we learn of previous happenings in Valiant's life. We find out that his brother and partner in the Private I business was killed by a Toon in Toon Town, apparently the name for their section of Hollywood/L.A.The story unfolds like an artichoke, revealing a secretive world of crime, illicit sex and political corruption that would be the envy of Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe or the Robert Towne/Roman Polanski collaboration on CHINATOWN(1974).Like the meandering of a great river, the plot twists and turns wherein we finally have the answer to the Roger Rabbit's accused whodunnit, but also to the killing of Eddie Valiant's brother, who was_______________! No, that would definitely be a spoiler!The film succeeds on several levels. Obviously it is a great animated feature, and one surely unlike any that have gone before. Chances are there will be other efforts (like the very enjoyable Warner Brother/Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies production of SPACE JAM(1996)starring Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, Charles Barkley, Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Sylvester, Tweety, Taz Devil, Foghorn Leghorn, et al......)It is also a very good spoof of the Hard Boiled Detective story or even the Film Noir genre that had gotten so popular during and (especially) after World War II. The sets, the costuming, hair styles,the fashions and the vintage autos made it very much of a period piece.So, no matter what, this WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? was nothing special, I mean there's no deep meaning, no symbolism, no message-right? Well, I'm not so sure. Please, indulge me and check out what follows.Well, to begin with Eddie Valiant expresses a deep dislike for this certain group, these TOONS. His brother was killed by a TOON. The two brothers had been cops in TOON TOWN. And when the mention was made of that INK AND PAINT Club, followed by the caveat,'Humans Only!'Now, can you think of any real life situation that would put you to thinking about this situation? Where did we have sections of a city that were occupied by one group but had entertainment establishments that catered to those from outsider their local community? Was there or is there still sections of a city referred to as being (Blank!)Town? Maybe it's just my overactive imagination!But, I don't think so.",10,6,7,30 August 2007
Citizen Kane," What does a guy do when he starts off at the Top and Tees Off a guy named Bill, William Randolph Hearst, that is..
","It comes to mind of an incident occurring back at the work place, which was directly related to CITIZEN KANE (RKO Radio Pictures, 1941) and to the why to its having been almost universally held as being 'The Greatest American Film.' The 'work place' was the Chicago Police Department, the year was ca. 1991. The question of 'They're having CITIZEN KANE on cable all week long. Why are they doing that?' The question was posed by one of my old partners, a guy whom I had known for about 25 years at that time. Let's just call him Officer Elmo Aymee. (Much like DRAGNET, 'The names have been changed to protect the Innocent.'As for an answer (there were about 6 of us in the Doughnut Shop then) it was myself who finally answered 'Well, Elmo, CITIZEN KANE is considered to be the greatest film of all time, and this is its 50th Anniversary.' Without much of a hesitation, Elmo responded; 'Yeah well, I'm not watchin' it because I don't like Orson Welles!' That was sure as about a tough and unexpected a reply that could be returned; but I did my best to maintain the 'high' level of this discussion by saying, 'Well then you must not have seen THE MUPPET MOVIE (1979); as it had Welles in a Cameo, toward the end.' But now seriously, folks, it is no exaggeration to heap such praise on the Film. And it is certainly not considered to be puffing to bestow such a title as the Greatest Film on this one, singularly conceived and so constructed movie. We must remember that at that time, circa 1940, the young Mr. Welles was considered to be a young genius with his Star still rising in the Hollywood Zodiac. His accomplishments in varying theatrical areas were undeniably superb, being in the classification corresponding to Academia's designation as 'Suma Cum Laude', or in the Queen's own tongue, 'With Highest Honors'.* We of course know of his famous and infamous 'WAR OF THE WORLDS' national broadcast over CBS Radio in October, 1938 as a weekly installment of The Mercury Theatre of the Air programme. Everybody's heard of that and there was even a Made-for-Television Movie telling the story. But the accomplishments of the young Orson Welles date back much further than that; extending back to the time before the New York Stage and Radio days. .At 14 years of age as a Prep School Freshman, young Master Welles was writing and producing plays which were staged at the Woodstock Music Hall, in Woodstock, Illinois. This was nothing unusual, for the talented adolescent lad. This sort of thing had become expected of him and no surprise in those days in New York with partnership with John Houseman in the Federal Theatre Project.So when Orson was being courted by RKO Radio Pictures to ink a 'standard, Rich & Famous' Hollywood contract; Welles would continually make what would surely be deemed as being outrageous demands, but RKO apparently 'double crossed' him. They gave in. So, it was armed with guarantee of absolute Artistic control and an essentially a 'the skies are the limit' budgetary considerations, that he headed West; taking his company of players and Musical Director, Mr. Bernard Hermann, along for the ride and appointment with destiny.OUR STORY.Aw, c'mon! We all know that! So let's waive this part. All in favor signify by saying, 'Aye'! All opposed signify with 'No!' The 'Ayes' have it. So, on with the Show, Schultz! For such an outstanding example of the Cinematic Arts, the underlying structure of the story & screenplay is rather simple, amazingly non-intricate even. When all is cleared away, what we have left is a good, old-fashioned Detective Story. Sure, we have no hero with names the likes of Sherlock, Marlowe, Spade, Blackie or Philo. And there are no colorful supporting characters to help solve the mystery. There's no mysterious murder, but there is the mystery of the identity. Just who or what is 'Rosebud' and just what did this mean to Charles Foster Kane on his deathbed? The non-frilled structure of the Detective Story would certainly not be enhanced by the use of flashbacks, for the flashback is an almost indispensable ingredient of the way a detective or other investigative person uses by way of the interview. But again, how does an otherwise normal and standard story-type command such great acclaim and accolades? The 'secret' lies in the methods of story-telling by flashback with the most colorful of overlays. As the story continues to unfold, it goes over the same ground already covered, but it always takes us a little more along the way. The story is also seen from a different view point each time some re-visitation occurs.All of the scenes no matter where they come in the story, in present or flashback, are accompanied and successfully underscored with the original score of themes, queues and incidental music, all specially ordered and special delivery sent to the movie audience by the Maestro, himself, Bernard Hermann.As a result of the Mercury Theatre Company's relocating out to the 'left coast' it truly does appear that Tinsel town would never be the same. First of all, Mr. Welles' own Star quickly increased in size to that of a Nova and then to the status of a Super-Nova; before its explosion and crashing down to Earth. It would be years before Orson's brief flirtation with life at the top was gradually supplanted with the appreciation with performances in films like THE STRANGER (1946), THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947) THE THIRD MAN (1949) and scores of other roles over the years.And over the years whatever the role that Mr. Orson Welles had in whatever film project, or Television appearance, he always did his best in giving his all. And that includes THE MUPPET MOVIE.",10,4,6,16 January 2008
The Birth of a Nation," Griffith's Epic Groundbreaker, Reputation Tarnished Due To Its Handling Of Sensitive Subject Material.
","REGARDLESS OF HOW repugnant some of one's national History might be, there is never any excuse to revise even the most disgusting of episodes. Rewriting chapters to make them more palatable to the God of Political Correctness. We owe it to our ancestors, our generation and to our children's generation, as well as to all generations to come to do as best job possible; that we the very best and most truthful historical tableau as is possible.THERE HAVE LONG been many a glowing review of the film's many outstanding attributes. Never has there ever been any critic to find fault with Director D.W. Griffith's innovative story telling, bold camera work and general brilliance in bringing the story from the printed page. Always there is the caveat, attached to any other positive and praiseworthy aspects that it tells the story of the Post Civil War Period. Known as the the Reconstruction, the painful time was told from the point of view of the South; namely the former Slave Holding 'Aristocracy'.UNFORNUTELY, THIS ONE fact haunts the film and seems to set it apart and denigrate it as somehow being evil, contemptible and utterly without any social redeeming qualities. There also seem to those who are among the Political correctness crowd, who, without benefit of a viewing. It is as absurd as Congress passing a Bill into Law; without first having read it and both know and understand is content.TO BEGIN WITH, the film starts with a title card; which states that the first seeds of discontent and regional disharmony were sown when the arrival of the first Blacks to the American Colonies. In all fairness, the wording on the Title Card would seem to be pointing its finger of blame on those brought onto the North American scene for creating any of all discontent. This of course is total absurdity to anyone; regardless of whatever the point of view.AS THE STORY is unfolded, it reveals the changes that occur with the end of the American War between the States; all the while making extensive use of footnoting as a tool of checking the veracity of what is being portrayed.THE FILM PORTRAYS President Abraham Lincoln as the just and fair man he truly was. His announced policy was to treat the Southern Cesessionist States as if nothing had ever happened.THIS, OF COURSE, as we all know, never came to pass; owing to President Lincoln's assassination.ENTER THE TRUE villains of the story; that being a faction of the Republican Party known as the Radical Republicans. Their being in both the Senate and the House of Representatives made for the passing of overall harsh regulations governing the former Confederate States. Federal Troops were put into the position of a Force of Occupation.MEANWHILE, NOW FREE former Slaves were thrust into positions for which they were ill equipped to handle.Those who had been born as property, chattel if you will, were now holding political office, without benefit of experience, education or the full authority of office; that being reserved to the military governors.ABUSES GREW AND were made worse by the Radical Repulicvans. Once again, those who had not carried out the doctrine which Mr. Lincoln had desired were carry out their wish to punish the South by pitting one group against the other; using the now free Blacks as unwitting tormentors of their former masters.BOTH THE DIRECTOR, Mr. Griffith and the Writer make known in no uncertain terms that race miscegenation, or mixing of the races, is of paramount concern to them. Their are several mentions of such behaviour. One character espouses inter-racial marriage; not just as a possibility, but rather as mandatory.THE GREATEST OBJECTION to this D.W. Griffith's silent epic is the finale. After bringing us through so many years of Reconstruction, the day is saved by the emergence of the Ku Klux KLan; which defeats a group of Negro Milita in battle.AGAIN WE MUST contend that historical fact mustn't be ignored; however distasteful it may be. The emergence of the Klan, it would appear, was quite similar to other events in the world. Certainly the formation of the Union Siciliana (the Mafia) in Sicily came about because the people of that island were subjugated to many a conqueror in its history. Hence, a highly secretive, shadow government evolved, SIMILARILY, HUNDREDS OF years of rule by the English led the Irish in the formation of the Irish Republican Army or I.R.A., for short.ONCE AGAIN, WHAT is surely the most degrading, cruel and inhuman of practices in slavery, is dealt with in a fully open and frank fashion. In this respect, it surpasses GONE WITH THE WIND in its boldness and it did so without one of those super budget epics; that would come down pike in latter.INSPITE OF ITS blunt treatment of so many of these unpleasant topics, BIRTH OF A NATION doesn't gloss over any of it as say GONE WITH THE WIND DOES. As an example, we offer the manner in which the latter day film glosses over the Klan; opting instead for having Ashley Wilkes lead a moonlight raid of a shanty town, but without the white sheeted garb. The KKK was not even mentioned, not once.",8,1,5,15 February 2011
42," Breaking Baseball's Color Line On Celluloid
","WHEN WE BECAME highly 'Baseball Aware', it was 1956 and it was a great year for a 10 year old to be in such a state. It was a time of great symmetry and balance in the Major Leagues. There were no Divisions, no Playoffs, No 'Wild Card' teams. The Pennant Races were confined to 2 eight team leagues; with a winner take all policy for the 1st Place team. Then it was on to the World Series.SO THIS MADE it possible for us to have seen Jackie Robinson play; albeit only on televised games.* At a tender age, such as we were, there was no way for us to understand the significance of his place in the History of the Game, and for that matter, our History in general.THE FILM'S PRODUCTION team had striven to weave as much true historical fact into a tightly knit storyline; that never seems to slow down or become excessively preachy or sentimental. To its credit, the screenplay reads like a slice of life.WHEREAS IT WOULD be easy for this story to become too grim or too 'Pollyanna', accurate replication of well known, real life incidents allow it to maintain an even keel throughout.BY WAY OF example, we choose the following examples:First of all, Brooklyn Dodger General Manager, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford)says that Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) is his choice to break the color line because, like Rickey, Robinson is aMethodist!Rickey also admits to having ulterior motives; when he states thathe wasn't undertaking such a move just in the name of doing the right thing. He states that there is a lot of talent in the Negro Leagues that would hence become available.Lastly, in an early scene, Robinson is being insulted in the worst possible way. The racial slurs finally get on the nerves of Dodger 2nd Baseman, Eddie Stanky, who intervenes on Robinson's behalf. Stanky, who was 'a Good Ol' Boy' from Alabama, did not like the idea of Robinson's being on the team; but he thought that it was cowardly that any opposition player would behave so, knowing that Jackie had pledged to remain silent and never retaliate.GETTING BACK TO real life, Robinson played in that 1956 Season, including the loss to they Yankees in 7 games of the World Series. That was his last hurrah in the Big leagues.IN VERY SHORT order, his hair turned from black to silver. Jackie Robinson died in 1972 at age 53. We can only surmise why he left Planet Earth with maybe 2 decades or more of a possibility. Our guess is all of that internalization of the great tension greatly shortened his life span.Small Wonder!NOTE: * In Chicago, we had the opportunity to see all Major League players; but being a devout White Sox fan, we wouldn't go to Wrigley Field and the Cubs!",10,1,4,8 May 2014
Batman Returns," In BATMAN RETURNS We See Why Michael Keaton Split!
","Once again, we have a case of taking some liberties with an established comic character. Where we understand the need to adapt certain material from one medium to another, we must protest when a writer/director monkeys a little too much.In BATMAN RETURNS,the second of the Batman Big Screen Box Office Bonanzas, we have what seems to be a formula.Following 1989's BATMAN, which featured the Origin, even the Christening* of The Joker. For the most part, the story was well handled.(Read my Review of the 1st Tim Burton BATMAN(1989) ).Starting with #2 Film, BATMAN RETURNS, we seem to have some doubts about sustaining a full 2+ hours with just one measly Arch Villain to do battle with. So, a sort of split time screenplay with 2 separate(but equal) sub-plots; almost like having 2 different movies.As to the Selina Kyle Catwoman episode, we can give it a reluctant o.k., or at least an 'o'. Mr. Burton took the Feminine Feline Angle, and ran with it. From a female enemy, who had been a Second Story Woman** and a Gotham City Socialite, to a Career Girl with an almost Lycanthropic*** relationship to her cats. Interesting, we haven't seen her return, yet.As to the Burton treatment of The Penguin, well that's another story. In looking back into Comics' History, we find that the Penguin made his First Appearance in the lead Batman Story, 'One of the most Perfect Frame-ups!', Detective Comics #58, dated December, 1941. The story was penned by Bill Finger, long time Batman scripter and the writer responsible for so many of the Batman items , of which we all have come to be accustomed.In the story, Mr. Bruce Wayne and his Ward,Dick Grayson observe a very unusual looking, little man at an Art Gallery. They make the observation, '...Doesn't he look like a Penguin?' As the story progresses, we learn that the 'funny looking' little guy is up to no good. He is a criminal, of the caliber requiring the attention of The Dynamic Duo.At an early part of the story we hear the true name of The Penguin spoken. It's Mr. Boniface. That's his name, Mr. Boniface. (Remember this, it might be on the Test!) But just a name change alone is a bad enough transgression. But, the movies Origin and Characterization are hardly palatable.The Tim Burton remake the Penguin a Totasl Freak of Nature, not only abandoned by his Parents (played by Mr. and Mrs. Peewee Herman), but thrown into a sewer after a life in which his deformities were hidden from the world. Flipper Feet, Wing-like Arms, an Elongated and Beak-like Probosis, Beedy Eyes and Larry Fine-like Hair. Add that raspy, dry, gravely voice that Danny DiVito uses and you have a study in the Grotesque, a Classic example, no less.The Penguin of the Comics and of the Batman TV Series (1966-68)was odd, peculiar but not gross as Director Burton re-made him. I don't think he was such a Hommicidal Maniac, either.If the Penguin was any thing with his short stature, his waddling walk and his ever present Tuxedo and Top Hat, along with his wearing of a monocle, he was Eccentric.In looking around for just what was the inspiration for Batman cartoonist, Bob Kane and chief script writer Bill Finger in creating the Penguin, we have a theory. Just watch John Huston's THE MALTESE FALCON (1941), Starring Humohrey Bogart. Just take a look at the portrayal of Villain, Kasper Guttman by Sydney Greenstreet. His looks, his costuming (right down to gloves and spats),his slow waddling gait,the rolly-polly build all lead one to conclude that he was the inspiration for the Penguin. Certainly not this grotesque, twisted sewer dwelling monster.* In giving the gangster who would become The Joker the name of Jack Napier, Mr. Burton did us all a favor. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe he ever had any other name.

The Great Dictator," While Resorting to the old 'Evil Twin' Ruse, Sir Charles sacrificed 'The Little Tramp' and the Golden Silence for a Singularly Fine Film!
","As far as really good examples of Pro-American, Pro-Allied Forces, Anti-Nazi Germany World War II films to come out of Hollywood are two. One is the Walt Disney Donald Duck short subject,DER FUEHRER'S FACE(1942). The other is discussed in the following. It has been said that The One and only Constant is Change. We're not sure who said it; though we did know, it changed on us! This World wide Change or 'State of Flux', if you will, was very evident in the period between the two World Wars, and in every aspect of life. Political unrest, Pop Cultural Shock, Shifting Mores and a Post 'War to End All Wars' Era all combined to give us a World barely recognizable to the Populice of 30 years or so before.And just think! First it was 'How You Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm, Now that They've Seen Par-ee!', and then they went and stuck us with National Prohibition! That's another thing, The Volsted Act, Mother of Temperence, or Organized Crime? But in any case, we had a great wave of change had overtaken Hollywood, hitting it from every direction. Undoubtedly the greatest shock-wave here came from the Sound Revolution. The Motion Picture had spent the previously 30+ Years in being forged, honed and fine tuned. The result was a Beautiful New Art Form; being a perfect Marriage of Visual Imagery with the Printed Word(Title Cards), with some emotional support of Musical Accompaniment.Now along comes people like Inventor Lee DeForrest and Company. With them they brought processes like 'Vitaphnoe', 'Western Electric Recording System', 'RCA High Fidelity' and even 'Photophone Recording Process'. Almost over night, the Studios and Movie Going Public became just about totally obsessed with SOUND, DIALOGUE, ALL-TALKING & ALL-SINGING! Charlie Chaplin was in as good a position as any to meet the challenges of the 'New Era'. His position, wealth and influence had rapidly and steadily grown from the time of his signing his first one year deal with Mack Sennett and his Keystone Studios. The popularity of his 1 and 2 Reeler Comedies brought him successively better financial growth and artistic autonomy over his films. Progressivly improving contracts with Keystone, Essanay, Mutual and First National, led to his owning and operating his own 'Chaplin Studios' and his co-founding the UNITED ARTISTS Corporation.* So Mr. Chaplin had successfully been able to forestall the intrusion of Sound and 'the Talkies' into his film world. Both CITY LIGHTS(1931) and MODERN TIMES(1936)had sound tracks, but it was mostly filled up with Musical Scores(written by??**)and some sound effects. But the 1930's were rapidly coming to an end, and August 31st with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany from the West, followed by The Red Army of Soviet Russia's pouring in from the East.Chaplin wanted to make his next film something truly special, unique and truly a 'One of a Kind' for the Depression Ridden '30's. It would surely appear that 'The Little Tramp' succeeded.In THE GREAT DICTATOR, we are shown a metamorphosis on the screen, right before our very eyes. It was done subtly, without the obvious being said, shown or even implied.In the earliest scenes we are brought up to 'the Front' in World War I. It is a fictionalized version , though only lightly so. The 'Enemy' Army is identified as being the Army of 'Tomainia', but the soldiers, Officers and Enlisted Men, all have a decidedly German look to their Wartime Fashion. A certain allusion is made to 'Big Bertha's' being used by the 'Enemy'.*** At this point we are introduced to 'A Jewish Barber'(Charlie Chaplin) who is on an artillery crew turned into Infantryman. The scenes involving the battle, heavy smoke and an encounter with Allied Forces(could have been either Brits or Yanks, uniforms similar).But as this segment winds down, we are essentially saying good-bye to the 'Little Tramp' and his beautiful, mime filled world of silence/silents.From then on, Wrtier/Director Chaplin uses A Case of Mistaken Identity(The Jewish Barber & Dictator Adnoid Hynkel both=Chaplin); by God, it's the old 'Evil Twin' plot! To this we see real-life like incidents, such as the Big Meeting of Dictators, Adenoid Hynkel & Benzino Napolini(Jack Oakie in his hilarious Parody of Benito Mussolini)and the annexation of 'Austalich'(the Austrian 'anshlucz'or union).In addition to the already mentioned Mr. Jack Oakie, we have Paulette Goddard, then Mrs. Chaplin in the Female Lead(Hannah). Also featuring Henry Daniel, Reginald Gardiner, Billy Gilbert(Herring=Herman Goering spoof), Bernard Gorcy(Leo's real life Dad), Maurice Moscavitch, Richard Alexander, Hank Mann, Leo White, Stanley 'Tiny' Sandford,Chester Conklin, Cyril Ring, Hans Schumm and many others.Perhaps a little long for some maybe, but there is no wasted film here. Sir Charles took every opportunity to paint his Hitler parody as a buffoon, a maniac and a dangerous fool.And Chaplin, speaking as himself, wraps it all up most seriously and imparting a wish of Hope to a Crazy World. NOTE: * THE UNITED ARTISTS Corporation, founded in 1919 by Douglas Fairbanks,Mary Pickford,Charles Chaplin and D.W. Griffith.NOTE: ** With no formal training and not being able to read music, Chaplin did compose his own scores and even hit songs, 'Smile'(from MODERN TIMES)and 'Love This Is My Song!'(from A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG,1967 his last film).NOTE:*** 'BIG BERTHA'(in German 'Dicke Bertha',nickname the Germans had for their Model L/14 Heavy Mortar-like Howitzer.",10,1,3,22 September 2007
The Natural," A Long and Meandering Road for young Roy Hobbs. From Farmboy to Shining Knight with a 'Wonderboy' at his side!
","The story is most likely inspired by a true life incident that happened right here in Chicago in the period just following World World II. A poor, mentally imbalanced woman stalked a Major League Baseball Player and did Shoot and critically wound him. Fortunately, he lived.Using flashback, the story takes us from the now 35 or so year old Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford)sits,alone, lonely and obviously being very thoughtful, sitting in a Railroad Station, waiting for his Train. We look at his serious, weary face and are instantly that this is a man who has been through an ordeal. Life has not been easy. His countenance retains a permanent sadness, as if it were etched into a stone sculpture.The story takes us back some 20 years or so to see this same Roy Hobbs as a young Farm Boy, playing catch and shagging fly balls with his Father (Alan Fudge). Roy excels in every phase of the game. While practicing his pitching, his Father praising him, but cautioning him that he should never take it for granted. 'You've got a gift,Roy. But that's not enough!', Father admonishes him. The neighbor Farm Girl, Iris, watches them practice.Time moves on and we see Roy witness his Father's fatal heart attack, right under the huge sycamore tree next to their farm house. Young Roy continues to cling to his dream to be a Ballplayer, his walls decorated with pennants of various National League Teams including the mythical New York Knights.A violent thunderstorm brings torrential rain fall and a heavy bombardment of lightening strikes the old, huge sycamore causing it to split open, shattered down to a stump. Roy chops out a large section of timber, and finely hones it down to a custom made Baseball Bat.Fast forward and we find Roy, now newly graduated from high school, running through the farm fields to meet the now also teen-aged Iris(Glenn Close). Having a great announcement about his having been called up by the Chicago Cubs for a look see at his Baseball talents. They go in such a jubilant, hurried manner to the barn that we know that they've been there before. Roy announces the good news, they hug and kiss. He would be leaving town, bound for Chicago. 'I want to marry you!', declares Roy. 'I'll send for you!' To celebrate, they go for a roll in the hay, apparently for the first time.The rest of the flashbacks tel the story of Roy's journey to Chicago and his getting sidetracked in his quest for the Major Leagues. Youth, coming of age-suddenly and the inevitable development of at least some degree of cynicism along the way.Some have been critical, declaring it too long and meandering. We could't disagree more. The screenplay moves along at a good clip, but not too fast. Yet, it still does not overdue, or 'pad' out, if you will, any scenes.As for the all important aspect of casting, Director Barry Levinson and Company would seem to have covered all the bases. After the parts of Roy and Iris are firmly identified with Mr. Redford and Miss Close, the choice of the rest of the players was no less fitting.We have Roy's High School Coach Sam Simpson (John Finnegan) who is both fatherly proud and cautiously protective of his young protégé. Sportswriter Max Mercy(Robert Duvall), who would stab one in the back if it meant the right price or a little more circulation.We have the 'other women' (not just one, but two),Harriet Bird(Barbara Hershey)and Memo Paris(Kim Bassinger) helping to provide bumps in the road for Roy.The Big Time Gambler, Gus Sands (an uncredited Darren McGavin)provides a large measure of villainy, especially when in cahoots with N.Y.Knights Owner, The Judge (Robert Prosky). As usual, Mr. Robert Prosky turns in a fine, somewhat underplayed, masters' performance.Team Manager/Part Owner Pop Fisher(Wilford Brimley) and Coach Red Blow(?)(Richard Farnsworth),provide a team of tough, cynical yet lovable 'old codgers' to run the team and provide their best advice and judgment for the younger folks, especially Hobbs.I confess that my favourite character is Joe Don Baker as 'The Wammer'. He is the fictional Big League Slugger who Roy meets on the train, and later competes with at the Fairgrounds. Mr. Baker presents us with a huge and powerful, bigger than life slugger. As nasty and vain as he is talented, Joe Don's 'Wammer' also bears quit a resemblance both physical and personality-wise to one George Herman 'Babe' Ruth.* The location shooting included a lot of work in and around Buffalo, N.Y., which doubled for parts of New York City as well as Chicago.The use of Buffalo's War Memorial Stadium as a 'stand-in' for both Wrigley Field, Chicago and for the mythical Knights' Field in New York City.Oh, my own personal scene of the whole picture comes along right about midway when N.Y.Knights'Star Outfielder, Bartholomew 'Bump' Bailey gives his all for 'Pop' Fisher and the team by running through the wall, literally. The scene and follow-up come together to demonstrate a fine example of 'Black Humour'**, a rare commodity in today's cinema.* Please don't accuse me of attributing any of the arrogant,vile and self-centered attitudes and behaviour to the 'Babe'. These poor and less than admirable qualities are strictly the property of 'The Wammer'.** 'Black Humour' is a little used term today for that which is found to be funny in a serious, sad or tragic situation. Illness, deformity and sudden death(such as 'Bump's') would be good examples.",10,1,2,21 July 2007
The Hustler," Shadowy World of Pool Shark, viewed in realistic treatment. A lot of folks thought it to be a true story!*
","It was the Science Fiction fraternity along with the domain of the Super Hero Comic Books that advanced the idea of there being 'multiple Worlds' or 'parallel Universes' coexisting side by side, albeit in different adjoining dimensions (or something like that). In particular it was largely promoted by, though not conceived by Science Fiction Writer, Comic Book Script Writer and Lawyer, one Gardner F. Fox.It was in the DC comics title, THE FLASH # 123, dated September, 1961, that Mr. Fox's full length story, 'Flash of Two Worlds!' premiered the Multi-Universe concept that became synonymous with the Super Hero Genre at National Comics, National Periodical Publications or Superman-DC. (Take your pick. They used all 3 names.) In this story, it was discovered that this multi-world set-up was in existence. The 'modern' Flash (Police Scientist, Barry Allen), accidentally stumbled onto the 'Original' Flash (Jay Garrick). They shared an adventure which led to future 'crossovers' of virtually all of DC's characters, both old and new versions. It was a great tool for the writers, for the revival of old characters and not so very bad when it came to the old Ca$h $upply! In a very real way, our World is divided into several sub-worlds of its own; all existing side by side, day after day. Some may call it 'Counter Culture'; others say 'Sub Culture' or 'World', even. But, though visible, these shadow areas are seldom seen by we lucky 'mainstreamers'. This finally brings us down to today's lucky honoree, THE HUSTLER (Rossen Films/20th Century-Fox, 1961).Filmed in a very dark, moody and shadowy Black & White, the film provides a fine canvass for painting such vivid and realistic a story. Adding on top of this about as fine a cast as was available. Beginning with anti-hero king, Paul Newman ('Fast' Eddie Felson) and Jackie Gleason (Minnesota Fats), the characterization is neat, crisp and dripping with realism. The other characters were cast with equal acumen. Lonely Lady, and Eddie's main squeeze, Sarah Packard (Miss Piper Laurie) totally made the role hers; crowning it with much worldly, bittersweet 'been there, done that.' Eddie's partner-manager, Charlie Burns (the highly underrated and versatile Myron McCormick) and sideline kibitzer/promoter Bert Gordon (Patton himself, George C. Scott) add pressures and tensions of their own agendas to the whole mix. Characters like big timer, Big John (Michael Constantine) and Millionaire Thrill Seeking Pool Shooter, Findley (Murray Hamilton) add to the main plot and move things along in interesting subplot scenes. We also are treated to appearances by Vincent Gardenia and Jake La Motta (the real life 'Raging Bull') as bartenders and veteran character Stefan Gierasch as 'the Preacher.' FORWARD.We open, even before any credits have rolled, with Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns stopping by a local saloon, posing as salesmen on their way to Pittsburgh. After a beer or two, they start a little pool-shooting and soon some locals think Eddie to be a potentially easy mark. After a less than spectacular game or two, the suggestion is made to play for some really high stakes. Deal made, game played, Eddie goes all-out winning big and cleans the locals out! (That's what pool hustlers do!) BOOM! Roll the credits! (And the great moody theme, too!) Felson has been out to meet up with one Minnesota Fats, ever since Eddie was a youngster learning the game in San Diego. Then it happens, but Eddie insists on beating the Fat man into an all out, unconditional, 'I quit-type' of a submission. ('Uncle, Uncle!!'). Being next to broke, after having the veteran Fats on the ropes, Eddie plies his trade with some other locals a little down the road, but looses his temper and goes all out to embarrass the lad. He is discovered to be what he is and the locals break his thumbs and take the dough.By this time he has met and concubining Sarah (Piper Laurie, remember?). Soon, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott) talks Eddie into going to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby Week festivities. There, he can cut into the millionaire money of some easy money, while giving his game a little tune-up.It is during this time, that Sarah, whom Eddie now loves so very much, is killed at the hands of (name withheld, see it!). Brokenhearted, Eddie eventually returns to Charlie and goes gunnin' for Minnesota Fats. FURTHER INFO DELETED! (See it, Schultz!) One thing we do learn is that, be it in main stream life or in a shadowy 'Parallel Universe' of someone like the Pool Shark, the Money is not the important thing. It is merely what money truly is, a medium of exchange. It is the competition and the winning that makes it all worthwhile.And that goes for all literary endeaveurs! NOTE: * Well I did, anyway! You know, being that there was a real Minnesota Fats, wasn't there? We seen 'im on TV!",10,2,5,16 February 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Can a Pair of Buddies maintain their membership in a Gang of Bank and Train Robbers and still be regular Citizens? and, Just where is Bolivia?
","We can well remember seeing a television special about the making of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969). It was some years ago, probably in the late 1970's and was very informative to a really uninitiated kid like myself. In an interview with the screenwriter, William Goldman, he revealed much about the motivation in writing the story and the intricacies of putting together a story part fiction, part legend, part true happenings.Mr. Goldman said that while there had been countless numbers of screenplays and movies about Jesse James, but not one had been written about Butch and Sundance. He had set out to do something about that. It would appear that now, after nearly forty years, that he had succeeded.From the very start, it became apparent that the story would certainly be something that was very different. Whereas there seemed to be certain criteria unofficially established to render a story a 'Western', Goldman, while keeping all this in mind, struck out in another direction. He gave the two outlaws full three dimensional personalities, idiosyncrasies, virtues and foibles. In short, they were rendered 'human', or as close as a filmed characterization could come.Starting off the story in 'town', where Butch Cassidy(Paul Newman) is obviously casing the joint in planning a future job. He observes changes at the town's bank. There are more locks, a guard is on duty at all times during business hours. The establishment closes promptly at 2 O'Clock closing time. 'What happened to the old bank?', Butch laments. 'It was beautiful!' 'People kept robbing it.', matter-of-factly replies the Bank Guard.Just down the street a piece sat the Sundance Kid, busily engaged in a mid-afternoon Poker Game. Sundance has been winning, and exception is taken to the fact by one of his opponents. Accusing Sundance of cheating, and threatening him with harm, standing and making it obvious that he would draw and fire at the Kid, if he didn't leave the money on the table and vacate the establishment.Butch enters and observes that there was a short supply of brotherly love at the Poker Table. Butch attempts to mediate the dispute. Sundance is as vehement about his innocence as his accuser was about his accusation of cheating. Arriving at the conclusion that his peace making is getting nowhere, Butch 'throws in the towel' with the final remark, 'I can't help you, Sundance!' News of his opponent's being the Sundance Kid brings a sobering effect on the accuser. 'I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating!', was his next remark, as he acquiesced to Butch's request to invite Subdance to stay, which he didn't. The two then ride away from town toward their hide out at 'Hole in the Wall'.This entire opening sequence was filmed in a sort of old fashioned Sepia Toned print. It is a process which is not color, nor is it Black & White. It was very effectively used, a real grabber to the audience.The effect was further amplified by use of a succession of close-ups. Eyes, clocks, locks, latches and faces all take their turn in being essayed by the camera lense's revealing encounters.As the pair rides off from town to their rendezvous with the Gang, the presence of full-color film fades onto the screen. It was a well planned and executed gimmick to grab hold that audience's attention.From then on, we follow the exploits of the Whole in the Wall Gang, its internal disputes, internal politics, etc. We also find out that an all star posse of specially hired lawmen whose only object was to hunt down and kill Butch and Sundance.Oh, and of all the fine performances turned in by suppoprting players, we must make mention of three in particular. They are: Kenneth Mars as the long-winded, short on influence town Marshall, Struther Martin as Percy Garris, American Mining Company Boss in Bolivia, and Jeff Corry as Marshall Ray Bledsoe, whose performance was absolutely pivotal.It was about this very point that Author Goldman said that he had gotten the most grief from 'the Suits' at 20th Century-Fox. After all, the outlaw pair leave the good old USA for the mining country in Bolivia. Now, no real American would do a thing like that, not even an American Outlaw! But, alas they did do that thing! That old TV special, previously mentioned, did reveal a lot about parts of the film that were excised from the full body of the work. This served as enlightenment about some aspects of the movie that we had been wondering about.For example take the very elaborate opening credits scenes depicting a train robbery by 'The Whole in the Wall Gang' as shown by the Thomas Edison Company.(all shown as the Burt Bacharach original Film Score starts in, slowly at first with a couple of Piano keys.) Why such extravagance for opening credits? As it turns out, the depiction of the silent film was from a deleted scene that had the Trio (Butch, Sundance and Etta) viewing a primitive Edison film in a Bolivian City. This was supposed to have actually happened! And the guys were very angry 'cause the Edison Co. Director got it all wrong!This would seem to be a trait that is all too common, even today!",10,0,2,1 October 2007
The Best Years of Our Lives," A Fine Touchstone and Baramoter of the Emotional Pulse of a Post World War II America!
","AT THE END of hostilities in the Greatest Conflict in the History of the World, Hollywood found itself in an all out War Production Mode. From the beginning of American involvement (and dating to the period before our Declaration of War), the Studios had done their part in the area of 'Morale Building.' OF COURSE THERE is another word for this particular; a word and practice that is widespread, universally employed by every nation in every time during all wars. In short, the practice is called 'Propoganda'; which for some reason continues to take on connotative meaning of something evil. For after all, the word 'Propoganda' is derived from the verb 'to Propogate; which means 'to breed or increase in volume of either plants & animals, or any inanimate objects or ideas.' THAT THE MOVIE Colony did its part in the War Effort truly goes without saying. But, just as the rest of the World would have to readjust itself toward a 'Peacetime' Mode; so too would the Movie Studios. But before any state of 'normalcy' could be achieved, the chapter about the multi-faceted Global Conflict would have to give way to a Post War, period of 'Peacetime'. But it is not unreasonable to portray life in transition.OTHER THAN THE thousands of casualties accumulated during the years following December 7, 1941 to May 8, 1945 ( V E Day) and August 14, 1945 (V J Day), there was much to be considered. What of the walking wounded;being those who bore war caused physical and emotional scars, which they would have to contend with.THE STORY OPENS up by introducing us to three returning Servicemen' all three headed home to the same town, Boone City; yet all three were strangers to each other, Each man is from a different part of town, a different station in life. The three strangers hitching a ride on board an Army Air Force transport plane are: Army Infantry Sergeant Al Stephenson (Frederick March), Army Air Corps Captain Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) and Navy Seaman First Class Homer Parrish.IN ADDITION TO their difficulties in returning to civilian life, the hitch in the Armed Forces of World War II; for each man has experienced the unintentional effects of a sort of social engineering. While being an accidental occurrence, the unrelenting dictates of the highly regimented military life remakes each man into whatever the whatever the War Effort demanded.HENCE, WE SEE that Al Stephenson (Frederich March) appears to be the gruff,working class, middle-aged infantry sergeant. Back in civilian life, Al returns to his role as a banker, with a wife (Myrna Loy) and two grown children (including Teresa Wright). Al lives in an exclusive hotel residence, complete with all the trappings of wealth.WHEREAS AL STEPHENSON seemed more gruff and working class, Air Force Captain Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), the guy who appeared to have the most in rank, status,position, etc. As it turned out the fly-boy officer was from the poorest section of blue collar tenements. Adding to Fred's re-entry problems is his quickie marriage to flighty floozy, Marie (Virginia Mayo).OUR LAST PRINCIPAL, Homer Parrish (portrayed by real life amputee veteran, Harold Russell) has to wrestle with his own inner self in coming to terms with living without his hands, and going on to marry his childhood sweetheart, Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell).PLOT COMPLICATIONS INCLUDE Fred Derry and Peggy Stephenson (Miss Teresa Wright) falling in love. As an act of poetic justice, the very shallow, scatter-brained Marie Derry (Virginia Mayo) announces her intention to seek a divorce; as she goes stepping out with old 'friend', Cliffy (Steve Cochran).EMPLOYMENT TROUBLES, IGNORANT know it all citizens (like the jerk portrayed by Ray Teal) in the Drug Store's Lunch Counter.AT A RUNNING time of 172 minutes, the film does not seem to be at all excessively long, nor is it ever seem padded out. Nearly 3 full hours transpire, and there appears to be a hopeful, if not exactly 'happy ending.' ONE THING IS sure, and that is that after over 60 years of being out there, be it on TV or at a Revival Theatre (such as Chicago's Music Box Theatre on North Southport Avenue), THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES was, and remains one of the greatest films of all time, period!",10,3,3,20 April 2011
Battleship Potemkin," Hey, 'Adolf' Putin, read this!!
","FILMING OF OUTDOOR events on a truly grand scale is the hallmark of this film. It is obvious that there was near unlimited budget and an autocratic and absolute control exerted by the director, Comrade Sergei Eisenstein. The filming is done in such a carefully plotted manner as to appear to be an actual newsreel documentary.THE STORY IS a retelling of a 1905 incident of rebellion and mutiny against the hierarchy of the Imperial Czarist Russian Navy. It builds its tension with use of varying camera angles, liberal doses of editing, imaginative & original lighting and boldly placed bits of shocking realism.THE FILM IS very powerful and will hold just about anyone's interest for the duration of its time on the screen. We do recommend that anyone and everyone can and should see it at least once, But we do do with just one caveat to all.THAT PRECAUTIONARY WARNING would be that we all must remember that the movie is and was intended as a propaganda piece for the likes of Joe Stalin and his comrades the USSR. Director Eisenstein definitely knew of what side his bread was buttered as he carefully crafted the telling of this 1905 incident on the Black Sea as an allegorical work. In his capable hands & clapboard, the whole situation and all of the incidents surrounding it were reduced to metaphor for the Russian Revolution and the ascent of the Communist Party.DURING THE PROCESS of telling this story, the director actually manages to make a case for the dignity of man. Now that is just bizarre and ironic; when one considers the track record of the Kremlin masters. The Communist Party has always called itself: 'The Vanguard of the People', no matter how many of their own people that they had to kill to prove it.",10,3,4,12 August 2014
American Sniper," Incredible Rendering of a definite Must See
","NO FILM CAN be 100% realistic, no matter how carefully crafted, well intended or highly budgeted it may be. We believe that this effort makes the best possible representation of the serious business and unthinkable horrors of war to have been committed to the cinematic screen.WE BELIEVE THAT it was U.S. Army General William Tecumseh Sherman who stated that 'War is Hell!' in response to some critic's expressing some disdain for his 'scorched earth' tactics during our Civil War. Combat is a kill or be killed proposition and there is no way of getting away from that. Regardless of whatever are the reasons for men being in harm's way, the brutal game is the same one that the enemy armies face each other.IN THE DEVELOPMENT of this story on screen, Director, Mr. Clint Eastwood, opens with battle in Iraq in progress and introduces us to main character, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), a veteran of many an operation, already out in the field and protecting his fellow soldiers (Marines). Making great use of the flashback, we are given a biography of the young Chris Kyle and how his being raised in a rural Texas ranching community was so influential in his attitudes and his prowess with the rifle.RECENT HISTORY IN both the U.S. and the World conspire to lead the young man from his role as a bucking bronco rider on the Rodeo Circuit to his decision to join the Navy Seals, following the atrocious events of September 11, 2001 ( 9/11). He meets and marries Debbie (Elise Robertson) and they have two kids, all during his active service and four tours in Iraq.THE STORY BECOMES a sort of marathon of wills as Chris Kyle displays such devotion to duty that he is left with some very serious problems in readjusting. He does manage to repair his damaged psyche by assisting other veterans. His redemption in civilian life is based on his strong conviction for protecting and aiding his fellow man in battle.AS FAR AS there being an ending of the story, it could not have been more contemporary, as the real Chris Kyle was killed by another veteran on February 2, 2013. This was a most ironic an end for someone who had undergone the dangers that he did, having done four tours in the Iraqi War. It is truly an example of 'Truth being Stranger than Fiction.' WE KNOW THAT there are some who have discredited both the film; as well as the memory of Chris Kyle. That's very sad; because, although we do believe that all are entitled to their opinion, we must remind them that if it weren't for 'ordinary' citizens like Chris, we wouldn't be able to be having this discussion right now. THIS WAS NEVER more relevant a truth than it is today. Just take a look at the headlines on any given day. Remember that we in the USA are continually referred to as 'the Big Satan.' JUST AS AN example of how different our time are from previous decades and past wars, just contrast the concerted effort that Hollywood made to snub American SNIPER at this year's Oscars with the accolades heaped on Gary Cooper's portrayal of the title character in SERGEANT YORK. Shame on you Hollywood! AS FAR THIS attack on the men and women who serve our country in the Armed Forces, we are reminded of an Old German Proverb:'If you want Peace, prepare for War.'",10,25,48,3 March 2015
Glory," Nothing is Perfect; But, Then Again...........................................
","BEING BASED ON fact, GLORY ( , Tri-Star Pictures, 1989) has taken its place in very short order. It is another example of the old adage that 'Truth is Stranger than Fiction.' FOR BENEFIT OF those in our audience who are not familiar with the film, let us present a short, basic and not too elaborate of a synopsis.IN SHORT, WE find ourselves in the early days of the American Civil War. From the point of view of a young Officer, Captain Shaw of the Massachusetts contingency to the Army of the Potomac. We soon learn from conversations and from his letters sent back to his folks, that the young Captain is from a wealthy family, well educated and has connections, politically speaking.AFTER RECEIVING A WOUND forged in battle, Shaw is furloughed home in order to convalesce. It is during this period that he becomes aware that the Commonwealth has plans to raise a regiment of Black Soldiers, most of which will be comprised of fugitive slaves, run away from the Southern States. There are also free born Blacks; one of which, as portrayed by Andre Braugher, is also well educated and a friend of the now Colonel Shaw.FOLLOWING HIS FURLOUGH and recuperation period, the young Mr. Shaw is informed that the Regiment is his; although the rank and file troops will all be Blacks, the officers will be White.THEN BEGINS THE task of turning these men into a a fighting force; a job complicated mainly because of the the deprivation suffered by the former slaves. Marching is more difficult because many of the recruits aren't aware of the difference between their right and left feet.THE BASIC TRAINING is tough and the discipline is meted out in a not sparing the rod manner.The young infantrymen learn much of their combat techniques from guys like the hard-boiled, Mick Master Sergeant; whose demeanor was much the same as any Drill Instructor in subsequent wars in our history.AS HARD AS things were, the men of the 55th display a rare desire to succeed and to become real fighting men. Their eagerness wins out in the end; but is dampened by a reluctance by those in command to use Black Troops in combat. The early assignments have them in little better than uniformed looters and arsonists.THE AUTHOR AND the Director's use of the various characterizations of the men serves as a reminder that regardless of our inclusions in various races and ethnicities, we are all individuals. We are responsible for our actions and indeed, our lives as individuals.VARIOIUS PERSONALITIES OR 'TYPES' are represented by the many, variously disposed personalities found in the roster of the unit. Hence we have the Educated Free Man (Andre Braugher), the streetwise,hardened Militant (Denzyl Washington), the Older and Wiser Veteran type (Morgan Freeman), etc.II IS THE words and actions of these and all the other players that the production team is able to speak to us and to the world about the need for just a little kindness and consideration for those around us. And the film never becomes neither preachy nor sophomoric; which would be a tendency that would be all too easy to descend to.ADDED TO ALL of the above is possibly the most brutally realistic depiction of infantry combat of that period. Never done for the sake of the gratuitous display of 'action' or to liven up any scenes; it was none the proper and necessary to have such violence displayed in the film.IN THE FINAL analysis, one can only have one last statement about this Civil War Drama. That being, GLORY certainly does not glorify war.",10,1,2,10 February 2011
Forrest Gump," Is this a clever and witty exercise of our intellects; or, is it just about taking Will Stockdale from NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS to the Nth Degree of the 'Hillbilly Scale?
","ATTEMPTING TO WRITE a review for this film has proved to be a very difficult job; in fact, it is probably the toughest review that we have encountered over this past decade. Producing a write-up is generally on one's overall like or dislike of the Film in question. Consequentally, our better efforts are rated higher than others for that very reason. Passionate prose requires a rationing of fist class, 'Grade A' fuel; strictly High Octane.THAT WE HAVE no really strong opinion about the worth of this now classic, Oscar laden favourite, leaves us with what we fear will turn out to be a figurative stalemate, a split decision, a statistical draw. And we are reminded of former Notre Dame Football Coach Frank Leahy, whose eloquence in surmising what it is like to neither come out a victor, nor failing in the attempt to secure a win.TO BEGIN WITH, the screenplay offers the telling of the story in flashback. The occurrences of what is nearly a life's worth of really unusual happenings and very unlikely coincidences, all seem to have been mixed into an emulsion of what can only be described as some of the most important moments in American and, indeed, World History.WHILE FULLY REALIZING that a Film, no matter how good it may be, is still just a movie, escapist entertainment. It is a powerful form of fictional day dreaming; but still it's make believe, nonetheless.WE ARE REQUIRED to be entertained by the incessant recitation of the narrative of all of these events that have led up to Forrest Gumps reunion with his life long friend and one true Love, Jennie. The long, deliberate cadence of Gump's delivery of this dialog is found to be very amusing, even to the most sour pussed stoic in the audience.SORRY FOR HAVING to throw cold water on our ongoing involvement in this mirth-fest but we really out to pause and give some serious and sober analysis to this, our cause of amusement.WHEN ASKED IN AN interview* about how and why LI'L ABNER creator, Al Capp, chose to build his comic strip around Hillbilly characte5rs in a most rural setting of Dogpatch, USA; his answer was delivered, quickly and in a most straight manner. Al stated that the use of Hillbilly characters was a nearly sure fire prescription for success. His reasoning being that the introduction of Hillbilly characters makes the job of succeeding in creating the desired yuk-yuks easier because everyone feels that they are superior to these American Rustics.WE MUST ALSO consider the characterization of Forrest as being not just uncouth or ill mannered; but rather that he is truly slow or mentally deficient. He most certainly must suffer from some acute degree of mental retardation. Is this what the pseudo intellectuals in the Elite of Tinsel Town believe to be the polite and proper cause for merriment and mirth? WE ALSO DETECT at least a smattering of snobbishness and sanctimony. This is amplified by an unabashed utilization of patronizing preachiness, which would seam to reassure the production team's moral and intellectual superiority; at least to their way of thinking, we suppose.NOTE: * This interview was done 1n the 1960's and published in a certain quasi-intellectual Men's Magazine; which also did a good business in peddling the exposition of feminine pulchritude and skin. Of course, Schultz and I only bought it for the articles. Honest!",8,2,3,12 February 2011
The Godfather: Part II," Boy Schultz, THE GODFATHER was so popular it spawned not one, but two sequels; not to mention a DOGFATHER Cartoon Series from DePathie-Freleng!
","THE SEQUEL has long been a reliable staple of Hollywood's yearly output. Forgoing any pretense of following a path toward the neither Artistic aspects nor Continuity. The all important a$pect$ of continuing a story from one hit movie i$, wa$ and always$ will be that of Box Office and Profit$; also known as the 'Bottom Line'. This is all understandable, for after all, making movies is a business.HENCE, we generally treated to a parade of inferior stories, watered down story lines and lame ideas that get to the screen only because of perceived relationship to a real, true hit. The roster of examples are loaded with the likes of: SON OF KONG, FRENCH CONNECTION II, McHALE'S NAVY JOINS THE AIR FORCE, RTEURN TO PEYTON PLACE, BACK TO THE FUTURE II, III, IV etc., CITY SLICKERS II, ANALYZE THAT, BELLES ON THEIR TOES, HOUSE OF Dracula and all of those Friday THE 13th & HALLOWEEN spin-offs.ON AN occasional a rarity occurs. A sequel picture comes along which is not only on par with the original, but in some cases actually tops the original. Titles such as BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, FOR THE LOVE OF BENJI and SUPERMAN II come to mind as prime examples. There are others out there; but for the sake of brevity, we'll hold down the roll call.ARGUABLY the greatest example of a sequel that surpasses its progenitor is Francis Ford Coppola's production of MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER: PART II; which just happens to be today's subject for dissection and analysis.PERHAPS the success of the original GODFATHER paved the way for such an unexpected surprise and hit. Critically and at the Box Office, GODFATHER II is considered to be an even greater achievement of film making. The reason probably lies in a maturity and coming of age by Director Coppola .IN LATER interviews, as well in his commentary that is included on the latest DVD set, Mr. Coppola speaks of the interference and attempted control of his artistic view of the picture was an almost daily bone of contention; especially during the early days of production. There was a great deal of meddling from the 'Suits' from the board room of Paramount Pictures; even extending to rumors that the big company wanted to replace the Director.LUCKILY for F.F.C. and the rest of us, he managed to survive long enough to get the picture over the hump and into the final editing room. The resulting product came out of the film editors' shop as quite a sensational film; being one that would go down as, arguably, the best gangster film of all time. Surely it could not be eclipsed! THIS UNPRECEDENTED and unexpected success earned Francis Ford Coppola his spurs as a full fledged Hollywood Director. His name would from that point on be mentioned in the same breath as Capra, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles, Huston, Spielberg and Scorsase.FOLLOWING such prestigious accolades, the Director now enjoyed full artistic control over his projects. Mr. Coppola was able to pull out all stops and do the picture he wanted in his own way. From this point on, the office gang at Paramount Corporate Headquarters could go and pound sand. The corporate monkey of the 'bottom line' was off his back, for good.SUCH freedom allowed for the drafting of a fine, complex story not only to serve as a sequel, but at the same time it was functioning as a prequel; which is a term that wouldn't come into usage for some years yet. The mounting of having both the story of Michael Corleone's ascension to the heights of the Underworld, as well as the wonderful and lengthy flashbacks into the early life of Don Vito Corleone, was truly a work of genius. By using this dramatic device, the screen play, a collaboration done by both Mr. Puzo and Mr. Coppola gave us a chance to compare the life and times of two generations of the Family and our Nation as well.WE do know that the working title of the project was announced as THE GODSON and some considerable amount of surgery had to be performed on the screen play; for the character of Frank Pentangeli (Michael V. Gazzo) was a late addition to the starting line-up; as the story had Peter Clemenca (Richard Castellano) in the role of the discontented Cappo of the Corleone Family.BUT Mr. Castellano proved to be unavailable; due to his insistence that his own writer would be the one to pen any and all of the character's dialogue. Refusing to give in to such demands, Coppola and Puzo wrote the Clemenca character out of the story; due to an unusual case of natural death; replacing him with this Pentangelli guy, who had been previously unmentioned.* WITHIN a short time of its release, GODFATHER II was hailed as a critical acclaim magnet; as well as being touted for its keeping high standards established in the first GODFATHER effort.AND just for good measure, Coppola and the boys at Paramount had them a real good pitcher and hot item at the all important Box Office. (Just funnin' around with them improper used words & grammar, right Schultz?) OVERALL and with all factors considered, in order to be fair, we'd have to rate this film with a 10+ rasting. So, we will.NOTE: * As further evidence, note all of the similarities in the two characters; what with his position, his henchman Willie Cicci (Joe Spinnell) and his keen interest & references to History.POODLE SCHNITZ!!",10,3,5,22 March 2009
Fargo," A Comedy in the Classic Sense, Played Out against the Northwoods Winter.
","Every so often a film comes along that is truly a unique work of a singularly unique story, style and execution as to put it all by itself, unable to be 'classified' and impossible to forget.FARGO(1996)would certainly seem to fit the bill. Just ask 6 people, who've seen it, just what was it about? I mean not just the plot, screenplay or scenario, but what, if any, 'message' was there? Was there any little bit of true life experience ? Can the viewer relate to it or see anything resembling our own lives? The film opens with little vignettes of two different households. We see the Gundersons, Marge(Frances McDormand) and Norm(John Carroll Lynch). She is the Police Chief of a small Minnesota Town. She is also 7 months along of being 'in a family way.' He is an Artist and apparently a stay at home 'Mr. Mom' type.The other household is that of the Lundegaards, Jerry(William H. Macy) and Jean(Kristin Rudrud). He is General Manager of his Father-in Law's Automobile Dealership. Jerry is ambitious and loves the Green $tuff a little too much. He has hopes of advancing up the corporate ladder to some kind of partnership. The Father-in-Law (Harve Presnell)tolerates him but has little use for him, shutting him out on a land deal that was basically the Son-in-Law's brainstorm.A bizarre idea for a phony kidnapping of his wife in order to collect a Ransom from the Old Man is hatched by Jerry Lundegaard's fertile imagination. Well, it sounds foolproof, no? We'll see.The of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare combine to form just about the creepiest pair of psychotic killer-thugs ever. Their mannerisms and demeanor are bad enough by themselves, but when together they become the embodiment of evil. They scared me, I mean gave me the creeps and I was a Chicago Cop for 'bout 34 years, worked in some pretty mean streets, too.The 'fun' all begins when the underachiever with all the bad debts closing in on him meets with these two Ghouls, and pitches the idea to them. Then, almost everything goes not according to schedule and puts layers of complications upon other layers, etc, etc.It has been said that 'If you sleep with Dogs, you'll get Fleas.' This is surely an apt slogan for the whole hair brained, cockamamie plot.Thre is an affectionate handling of the Minnesota setting and its inhabitants. The Director and Production opted for using local dialect in the speaking of the characters. The Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan Upper Peninsula inhabitants display a marked influence of their Norwegian and Swedish ancestors speech patterns. So much of their accentuation and slang expressions are direct descendants of the old Scandanavian settlers to this part of the Midwestern U.S. as to deserve recognition, with respect and affection. This Film did just that.But, when looking back at the whole story, once we get to The End title on the screen, we get to see that there is definitely a Morale or two imparted. And after several years and quite a few viewings, I believe that this Shanty Irishman has finally gotten some of its intended bits of wisdoms.We witness all of this outlandish, totally uncivilized and barbaric behaviour being perpetrated by otherwise peaceful law-abiding middle class, 'decent' folks. And in this case, we see can the readiness of the Son-in-Law to put his trust in these sociopaths.And even more ironic of a situation, right under our noses from the beginning is the roles of the Gundersons. He is sitting home with his Art while his Wife, while being pregnant and in the 3rd trimester, is out on patrol and pursuing the Bad Guys.See, it's kind of like our cockeyed world!",10,0,0,1 August 2007
Man of Steel," Look Ma, No Trunks!
","YOU CAN CALL us reactionary, if you like; but we prefer to look at it as being traditional. Just like what is right or wrong, some things just don't go away or evolve. So it is with our American icon and demigod, Superman.ONE JUST SHOULD not be tinkering with any of the established parameters. The legend of Superman, as was developed over the years and (we might add) are officially written in stone. Revisionism is one thing that flies directly into the face of what is well established.PARTICULAR GRIPES THAT we have with MAN OF STEEL, may seem to be petty to some of our readers. Well, we don't concur. The liberties that today's writers and directors take with long established super heroes, be the from Marvel or DC, are inexcusable at best and sacrilegious at worst.FIRST OF ALL, let us consider the costume changes. Okay, if they want to make it look like chain mail, so be it! But the disregard for the long standing tradition of 'Superhero Double Modesty' is just unacceptable. The exclusion of the Red Trunks being worn over the Blue Tights just goes too far. It is equal to having Santa Claus sporting a goatee.ANOTHER OF OUR complaints is what must be an attempt to replicate the scenario of BATMAN BEGINS by giving Krypton's favorite son a long, globe-trotting and meandering journey of 'finding himself.' This was handled much more convincingly and concisely in the Christopher Reeve initial outing of SUPERMAN (1978); which neatly had the young Clark Kent being clued in about all by the hologram of father, Jor-el. it took place in the Arctic Fortress of Solitude.* AGAIN WE MUST register a complaint concerning a violation of a key tenet of the Superman myths; namely his not needing any products from Gillette Safety Razor company. They actually had young Clark growing a beard on that tramp steamer or wherever he was while at sea. Any follower knows he can't do whiskers! THE CONTINUATION OF the Superman movie franchise would have been better served with a series following the less than spectacular box office bombshell of SUPERMAN RETURNS; which had a lot to recommend it. Other than Lois Lane's having a calf in tow, there was Kevin Spacey's Luthor; which remains our favorite characterization of the Mad Scientist.PLEASE, JUST GIVE us some returning to basics. Let's have all the best traditions of the Christopher Reeve era and less emulation of the 'modern', 'sophisticated' and 'adult' revisions.NOTE: * The Fortress was added to the comics storyline circa 1960. It was welcomed by we, the readers. Little did we know then that it was an idea stolen, right down to the name, from the DOC SAVAGE Pulp Novels; which predated Superman by some 5 years or so,",5,0,3,7 May 2014
The Caine Mutiny," An Outstanding Performance by Bogey, rapidly moving toward THE END(His Own!). also, a 'Not Bad' Kids War Picture & Great Soul Searching Human Drama for the 'Big Kids'!
","It was the 9th Birthday for one of my best life friends. On or about March 31, 1955, a whole bunch of us 4th Grade Boys were invited to the Senese Family House at approximately 6200 S. Marshfield.(NO GIRLS,IF YOU PLEASE!! Uh, Yuch!!) We were all classmates at St.Theodore Grammar School, only a stones throw from their house.There were 7 Senese kids, 4 boys and 3 girls. Gene ranked 3rd behind oldest Don and sister Therese.(then, after Gene we have Celeste, Geraline, Gerrard and Greg.) Their Dad, Leo Senese, was an auto mechanic working for a local Chicago Cartage Company and still had the reputation from his youth as being a really great Baseball Player(in High School). 'Hard Hitting' Senese was how one of the local newspaper guys described him,kinda like my Dad, Clem Ryan; but that's another story.We all knew that this would be a great party, as Mrs. Senese's reputation for throwing a great party was well known through various Church functions(Boy Scouts, Altar Boys, Holy Name Society, etc.); as well as their other get togethers. Every kis in attendance would be very happy with the shindig! And it is elementary that good eats, cold pop and a home made Devil's Food Birthday Cake all add up to a great time. It certainly did on this day.As if that wasn't enough, we were treated to a trip to the show! In the old neighborhood, this meant the old (noe gone) Ogden Theatre at 1625 W. 63rd Street. Gene's big brother, Don(the late Donald Senese*)had been given the job of providing the escort and perform supervisory functions on the excursion.(What a great Party! I hope that scale Model B-29 Flying Fortress, World War II Bomber was enough of a present!) The Picture was THE CAINE MUTINY(Stanley Kramer Productions/Columbia Pictures 1954), which was still at the shows then, winding down its run with the neighborhood houses like the venerable Ogden. I can't remember a 2nd feature, of which there usually was one. But, this was great! We had a Bugs Bunny, the Coming Attractions and this Picture, a War Movie yet! Well, with risk of sounding like an ingrate to our most gracious host Senese Family, the movie was 'all right', but a trifle short on the Action Sequences and heavy on the talk scenes. At was at least light on those 'mushy' kissin' scenes and had hardly any girls at all! It was a number of years later, at least 25 had gone by, and we rented THE CAINE MUTINY from our local video store, Classic Video on 63rd Street & Albany. This gave a previously unheard of chance to view the film again, only this time it was with benefit of age, experience, knowledge and (we hope) wisdom. The VHS cassette afforded one the ability to watch through, no commercials for Jim Moran's Courtesy Motor Sales or Mages Sporting Goods Stores, etc. Or, the film could be re-run, stopped and re-run again.More importantly, this time the film was understandable. The story line, though set in time of War, had a greater relevance to all of our human nature, no matter who we were as a people or a person. The conflict of World War II served as a most serious back drop to the human tempest we follow here.The Lonely Business of Commanding Men and the roles performed by fellas from the various social stratum and all walks of life are examined in detail. We see the Service Life through the eyes of the various characters, many with flawed views or self serving agendas. Commradiere, trust, friendship, rivalry, manipulation, betrayal, exploitation and self aggrandizement are all explored as two sides to the same scales.In the proverbial nutshell, a Court Martial is convened to determine the guilt or innocence of a group of subordinate Commissioned Naval Officers serving on the Mine Sweeper, the U.S.S. Caine. An incident on board ship during battle lead to the forced relief of the Commanding Officer,Lieutennant Commander Phillip Francis Queeg(Humphrey Bogart)by the next in command, Lieutennant Steve Maryk(Van Johnson). Lieutennant Tom Keefer(Fred MacMurray) and Ensign Willis Seward Keith(Robert Francis) are considered among the most culpable. Naval Staff Lawyer,Lieutennant Barney Greenblatt(Jose Ferrer) is appointed as Counsel for the Defense.The Stanley Kramer Production, Directed by Edward Dmytryk of the written for the screen play by Stanley Roberts & Michael Blankfort(additional dialogue)is beautifully filmed by Frank Planer and has a vibrant, meaningful Original Theme and Incidental Musical Score by Max Steiner.NOTE: * Dr. Donald Senese, Ph.D.(1942-2006).

North by Northwest," What more can be said?
","ONCE AGAIN, IT appears that partnering co-author and imaginary friend, Schultz, and myself have long overlooked the pleasure of writing a review of what certainly must be considered among the greatest ever. Perhaps this was an oversight on our part; for, being quite familiar with it and having screened it seemingly countless times over the past half century or so, we probably just thought we'd already done one. (See what happens when you get a little long in the tooth, eh Schultz?)HAVING DISPENSED WITH this perhaps egocentric and self-indulgent bit of written fun, we'll now attempt to get down to a fitting write-up of this all time favourite of so many.WHAT MORE CAN be said of such a singularly great piece of cinema? From stem to stern, beginning to end, even top to bottom, we're challenged, entertained, amused and totally satisfied. In every department; be it music (perhaps Bernard Hermann's most original score), mystery plotting, multi city filming locations, pacing and rep-oratory style assembly of players, all come together in a great single effort.ENGINEERING THE NEARLY perfect assembly of the final product is the master of the suspense story himself, Alfred Hitchcock. In keeping with some of his well established trademarks, he continued with the traditions established in a career that dated back to the last days of the Silents and the Ascent of the Talkies in his native England.FOR ONE, HE made his obligatory on-screen appearance in the very early scene catching a bus on a busy New York City street. His second traditional element is that of having the portrayal of great tension played out against otherwise peaceful, prim & proper, even bland & boring. Such is the confrontation and subsequent cleverly engineered escape at the Fine Art Auction.HITCH HAS ALSO long enjoyed putting his protagonist(s) in great peril against the backdrop of a well known, patriotically charged location. In THE SABOTEUR (Universal, 1941), it was the Statue of Liberty. In today's reviewed film, it is a pulse-pounding chase across the faced of the Mount Rushmore Memorial.THIS MOVIE IS one of those that one can see over and over again and still enjoy. So, our prescription calls for you to do so. And you sure won't be alone; what with the stone countenances of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt all looking in at story's end! SCHULTZ AND MESELF give it **** (4 Stars), one for each President making his stone-faced cameo. And Schultz asks: 'Ain't there two Roosevelts?'",10,2,6,9 December 2015
Spider-Man," Re-Spinning the Web re-Launches the Franchise, changing it into a SAM'S CLUB version of 'YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD SPIDER-MAN!
","Now that we have 3 of the Big Screen, Blockbuster SPIDER-MAN films, it's a safe thing to write a few lines about the inaugural film. Anytime that you undertake bringing the public an adaptation of a Comic Book Feature, who has had literally hundreds (Or even thousands?) of stories via Comic Books, you're in for some special problems.He has also had a: 1) a long running Spider-Man Newspaper Comic Strip, 2) Multiple Television adaptations, both Animated and Live Action Series, and 3) huge numbers of licensed Toys, Games, Lunch Boxes, Pencil Sets, etc. Yet, no matter, the series still must be given the Royal Treatment in its Maiden Voyage.That means 'back to the drawing board.' And even in a strictly written origin story that stays close to the original, there are bound to be variation or elaboration on the original. This is demanded by the march of time itself. For example; would you depict the origin of Superman, rendering it in the same style of 1938? Depictions that were valid and in one day just would not be in another. A little updating of the idiom is in order.Spidey's screen origin was adapted from the earliest days of the character dating to 1962. The film got the origin out to this early 21st Century Audience; while bumping it up just a trifle;yet the original spirit is intact.In the Spider-Man Origin Story, we see a loner and unhappy nebbish, one Peter Parker. He excels in his student, but lacks physical prowess in anything athletic endeavor. He suffers low self-esteem, having no faith dealing with the others, especially the opposite sex. Peter gets bitten by a radioactive spider finding himself suddenly endowed with all of those Spider-like powers and abilities; such as strength, climbing ability, speed and the all important 'Spider-sense.' Having little or no interest in using his powers and abilities for the betterment of all mankind; but, rather to make himself wealthy via exhibiting himself like a common, vulgar entertainer. It is at this time where his failure to act in aiding a robbery victim proves to be a fatal mistake; as the same thug turns out to be the one responsible for killing Peter's beloved Uncle Ben.Thus our Spider-Man learns a bitter lesson in that just a little bit of getting involved would have spared Ben's life. This spectre of guilt hangs over Spider-Manall of his life.Jules Feiffer in his breakthrough work, the collection: 'The Great Comic Book Heroes'*, described Spidey as the 'Woody Allen of Super Heroes', reasoning that just because one is endowed with these neato Super Powers and has established his alter-ego/secret identity/Super Hero, that he wouldn't have trouble with dating girls or being plagued by acne, excessive B.O. or even a case of the 'Zackleys.' The difference in the dual tellings of the tale involve the venue in which that the young Mr. Parker was using in his quest in cashing in on his new-found talents for some old fashioned, cold ca$h. The comics' origin in Spiderman # 1, had Peter's being booked on a Nationally Televised Big Time Network Variety Show. It was the Comics Pages equivalent of THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW, the Sunday variety show. By contrast the first SPIDER-MAN had change of venue, making his $eeking riche$ from Show Biz to a 'Taking on all comers' Wrestling Promotion. The Wrestling angle was probably more easy for today's movie goer.Our own personal favourite bit of casting is J.K. Simmons as The Daily Bugle Editor, J. Jonah Jameson. Mr. Simmons, who is possibly best known for his recurring part as Psychologist Dr. Emil Skoda, on Law & Order, really gets to ham it up in this role, which is really a sort of caricature of all of those hard-boiled Newspaper Editors that have been so prominent in our Hollywood Films for the last 70-80 years or so.Furthermore, Mr. Simmons is of the right age to have grown up with the Spider-Man saga; and doubtless would have to be well acquainted with his personality.We thought that the casting was over-all at least adequate, with most parts being manned by actors (and actresses) who were excellent in their roles. We are especially pleased with Toby Maguire in the lead & title role. We kinda woulda liked it if they woulda let Peter Parker use his glasses a little longer, as the specs were an everyday part of the wardrobe to the early Spidey Stories. (But that's just a small and very insignificant point.) The biggest boner was their making the ability to spin his web to being a part of his own biological metamorphosis, rather than its being a mechanical dispenser worn on the wrists. They will get by with it as long as they don't dwell on it. So, just pretend it never happened; and we'll all feel better.The screen version of The Green Goblin as portrayed by Mr. Willam Dafoe is quite energetic and an excellent choice for their inaugural Spidey venture. The theme of the over accumulation of power by the Military-Industrial Complex, in keeping with the words of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as a true to life problem.NOTE: * In 1965, the publication of Mr. Feiffer's THE GREAT COMIC BOOK HEROES, books on Comic Strips and especially ones about Comic Books were unheard of. The big book stores in Downtown Chicago; like Kroch's & Brentano's, didn't know where to display the books for sale; as they, at this point, had no such designated 'Comics' section.",8,0,1,3 January 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spinning A New, Big-Screen Web
","SO NOW, WE have the conclusion of the Toby Maguire chapter of the SPIDER-MAN franchise; but not without the passing the torch to new era. One series' having lived out its life and relevancy, it finds it being superseded by another version. Indeed, leads and casts come and go; but a SUPERHERO goes on and on and on and.......BEING DEFINITELY WHAT one would have to classify as being, perhaps, old lone purists, we are seldom totally satisfied with any adaptation of a Comic Strip/Comic Book character to another medium; be it Radio, Television or the Movies. This may well seem to be an obvious sort of difficulty and yet one that is unavoidable and inevitable. Yet, we (that is I) always find myself giving any super hero cinematic project the closest of my microscopic vision's scrutinies.* MOST FREQUENTLY, A PRODUCTION has had more positive elements than negative; hence, we usually can learn to accept the new version; at least for what it is. For if we want to see a completely true to the original comic adaptation, we should stick to the 4 colour, printed page.IN DEFENSE OF this latest celluloid Web-Slinger, we appreciate the tone that was set early on. Peter Parker is a young man with a tremendous power; which has been thrust upon him, all without his asking.** Even though he is now a truly super-powered costumed Super Hero, that does not mean that he won't be having his own lion's share of problems in his personal life.*** THE PRODUCTION TEAM should be congratulated for giving the Spider-Man legend a well thought out, serious treatment; without abandoning an occasional infusion of much needed humor,'comic relief', if you will. They do so without causing an awkward bump in the scenario; rendering it as just a normal part of life. Afyter all, if we cannot have an occasional laugh, even in the most dire situations, we would not be human.IN THAT AREA, we must mention that a high spot in the film came late in the action. It was the sequence that gave Spider-Man writer/editor/co-creator, Stan Lee his traditional Hitchcockian practice of doing an on screen cameo appearance. With this scene-stealer, Stan not only made his latest in film (coming toward the end during the big fight), but also his best, most substantial and most amusing guest shot! ONE POINT THAT we have to mention is the establishing of Spider-Man's web slinging abilities as being a technological augmentation; rather than being a biological mutation; as had been previously shown in the last three SPIDER-MANS. (Perhaps you find this as being just a trifle picayune, but remember, after all, we are first and foremost a Comics Puirst and Hard Line Traditionalist!)THAT THE VENTURE took us into area hereto for unexplored, was both a fine plot device and an area in the life of Peter Parker/Spidey that needed to be looked at. The retro-plot provided plenty of energy to drive the story forward and will certainly figure in the plots of future Spiodey sequels.WE MUST COMMEND the producer and the casting department for a fine job in casting in not only in the leads of Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone & Rhys Ifans; but also for the inclusion of Sally Field, Martin Sheen and Denis Leary in the primary supporting roles. (One knows that Father Time has been active when we have the former GIDGET and THE FLYING NUN, now portraying Aunt May!!!) SO, AS FOR the report card on this THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN flick, we cannot give it an 'A'; but we don't think a definite 'B+' is out of order.NOTE: * Origins, for example, don't have to be exactly as originally written, just as long as the main elements and the spirit of the character is retained and maintained.

Independence Day," We had thought of this Movie as a Juvenile project; BUT, 'Upon Further Review..............'
","WHEN first viewed, this INDEPENDENCE DAY (Centropolis Entertainment/20th Century-Fox, 1996), seemed to be a spectacularly done action flick; aimed at the Saturday Juvenie crowd, the kids. It was, we concluded, a sort of 'popcorn' outing that was custom tailored for the demographics of the Saturday Matinée set. Our conclusion: thisINDEPENDENCE DAY and films like it, we reasoned, were especially made as a sort of modern day replacement for the Cliff-Hanger Serials and the Juvenile 'B' Westerns series pictures; starring the likes of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, 'Wild Bill' Elliot and Sunset Carson.WELL we do confess that this first screening was done at the 'office' at Chicago Police Headquarters with all of the interruptions of the 'Police Procedural' daily routine. Ringing telephones and notifications were the main business of the day; ergo, our attention was divided and with our inability to make any proper evaluation was hampered greatly. We can hear you crying out in sympathy to our plight with, 'Poor Babies!' RECENTLY we watched INDEPENDENCE DAY on Fox Movie Channel with an eye toward being both objective and having a fresh and thorough evaluation; with no preconceived notions from the previous experience obstructing the view. Well hush my flannel mouthed face; but, there seem to be many layers of storyline and metaphor present that here to for had gone mostly unnoticed.CONTRARY to our (really 'my') previous pigeon-holing, the Film really has a lot to offer to all on many levels.FIRST of all there was no expense spared in preparation and in laying the ground work for the telling of what could have been a simple, straight forward story of conflict into a grand, even epic tale related in highly complex and intelligent terms. The story, the cast, the Special FX, the Cinematography and even the music were all given extra refining before being assembled into the finished product.LOCATION shooting included many sites in the United States; as well as Kenya, Egypt, London, 'Down Under' in Australia and some necessary In Studio This gave the films various scenes a truly World-Wide appearance. The highly complementary use of a highly diverse cast of characters as portrayed by an equally impressive variety of Actors and Actresses* made for a perfect fit with the storyline.MUCH like so many of the previously produced 'Disaster Movies', such as EARTHQUAKE (Film Makers Group/Universal, 1974), THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (Wayne-Fellows/Warner Brothers, 1954) and THE TOWERING INFERNO (Irwin Allen Productions/Warner Brothers/20th Century-Fox, 1974), the main story of the impending doom is made more interesting and human by having several smaller stories contained within its main framework. These sub-plots are almost usually devoted to personal crises that other wise pale by such comparison to the events of the day. You know what we mean; the quarrels, the divorce, corporate greed vs. individual rights, etc.AS for these said performances by the various cast members, we believe there was an outstanding collective effort by what has proved to be a sort of supporting 'Stock Company.' But of course, we do believe in giving some particularly deserving players a little extra praise. Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith) and his affianced Bride Jasmine Dubrow (Vivica A. Fox) provide an excellent story of a couple trying to make it, in spite of so many difficulties. The President, Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) plays a very human, albeit a highly skillful Chief Executive; well counter-balanced by his First Lady, Marilyn Whitmore, who is loving and supportive, yet a strong and independent, 'Her Own' woman.** LIKEWISE the on-screen contributions of such film Actors as : Judd Hirsch & Jeff Goldblum as a Father & Son Scientific Genius Duo, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn and Margaret Colin portraying Presidential Advisors, Harvey Firestein as a Super-Scientist and Randy Quaid's interpretation of the alcoholic old crop-duster & actual victim of Alien Abduction. Singer & Band Leader, Harry Connick, Jr., garners our honorable mention award as the 'buddy' and flying partner to Will Smith's main character.ANALYZING the overall effect of the film, we have to say that all characters who wore overalls in it did so quite well. (We just wanted to see if you were still with us!) MAKING a judgment about just INDEPENDENCE DAY really is on ALL levels, we have come to find that it is much more than the 'Bubble Gum' that we had believed it to be; while watching it in the divided attention mode, back at Police HQ's, so long ago. We now find it to be operating on several levels in addition to the very enjoyable battle scenes; like some advice for our Nation and the Free World. THE World faced an overwhelming threat in the Movie (Alien Invasion by self avowed exponents of Genocide for the Human Race.) The President is plagued with a plethora of advisors, who all seem to be feeding the Chief Executive with conflicting information. The threat is constantly expanding and at one point, President Whitmore states that we are up against an inhuman and ruthless adversary who will not abide with any 'Diplomacy'. He makes a statement like, 'Hell, we should Nuke 'Em!' IN drawing a parallel to our situation Today, we too face an enemy who wants only our destruction and a President may well have to follow what will be an unpopular foreign policy, at least for now; all in the interest of our People. It's sort of like what Harry Truman said about the loneliest job; 'This is where the Buck Passing Stops!' NOTE: * Yeah Schultz, we know; 'Actress' is not deemed to be very Politically Correct by the Correct Speech Fascists.NOTE ** Yes Oprah, that's spelled 'W-O-M-A-N!'

Gone with the Wind," The 1st movie to 'go Green'; having Recycled the Great Wall from 'KING KONG' as part of the fire in the Burning of Atlanta.
","THIS IS ONE of those films that everyone seems to have seen at least once. Afterall, it is very highly rated on everybody's lists of top 100 films. (It does seem to make it on most top 10 ratings also.) The reasons for this are really quite obvious and consequently, little thought, discussion or debate. This is a pity, for putting any work of art should never e exempted from debate, re-examination and, hence, potentially a revision in how we think of it in relationship to us and to Film History.WITH RESPECT TO 'GWTW' and its ranking in various categories, there would appear to be some fluctuation in its ranking. Some would be very high, whereas others wouldn't even 'finish in the money.' Allow us to give a rundown in certain pertinent areas. Later, those of you who are members of our 'Dad Dearborn's Amaterur Arnchair Director's Guild', can come up with their favourite rankings in 'kookie kategories.' CATEGORY # 1. As an EPIC, GWTW is right up there as it can be. The magnitude of the entire film is colossal and each part of the whole production are done up in a grand scale. The sum of all of these equal much more than those taken individually.CATEGORY # 2. As SOAP OPERA, it again rates up there. We vote it the very undisputed all time winner in this slot. There is a Lion's share of extra curricular activity going on; although its depiction is more suppressed and implied, it's explicit, nonetheless.CATEGORY # 3. Tops as an example of Character Driven drama it is superb. Tgis is no small feat when one considers that the backdrop of the story is The American Civil War and that period following it, known in American History as the Reconstruction.CATEGORY # 4. As far as its rating as a HISTORICAL DRAMA, it would fall somewhere in the middle; not because it doesn't portray the horrors of war, but rather because for reasons of omission. In the book, there is extensive mention of the rise of and subsequent underground activities of the Ku Klux Klan. In the screen adaptation, the Klan is never mentioned, there are no hooded horsemen. That sequence where Captain Rhett Butler uses the ruse of returning a gun shot bearing Ashley Wilkes home under the pretense of their being all drunken disorderly and having been at a house of ill repute (also never mentioned by name) was the only incident mentioned. It was referred to as the raid on a shanty town near Atlanta.ONCE SOMEONE ASKED Buster Keaton which was a better picture, GONE WITH THE WIND or Mr. Keaton's own THE GENERAL (Schenck/United Artists, 1927). Buster answered without any discernible pause that it was THE GENERAL, because it was base on an actual historical incident.",8,2,3,12 February 2011
Remember the Titans," Character Reigns Supreme
","OUR OWN DEAR Old Dad, Clem Ryan (1914-74) had a saying that 'Truth is stranger than fiction.', or something very much like that. Perhaps this was not an adage of his own design; but, nonetheless, there is a lesson to be learned here.IT SEEMS THAT every couple of years or so, a story taken right out of the headlines (or at least the Sports Pages) makes it to the screen. In recent years, we've seen the likes of HOOSIERS, RUDY, THE BLIND SIDE and now wee see that one will be coming out about a High School Football winning streak by a team from a De La Salle school by name.IN CASTING THE role of Coach Herman Boone, the selection of Denzel Washington, the success of the film at the Box Office was virtually assured. The only question was, could he handle what is the role of a more mature individual? If so, would the movie going public buy it? WE NOW KNOW that the answers are all in the affirmative, but hindsight is always 20-20.ANOTHER FACTOR TO be taken into consideration is that just about any Actor relishes the chance to be cast against type and be afforded the opportunity to expand his repertoire s swell as to add to his resume. Mr. Denzel Washington did just those very things. The name of the game is acting and that's just what they want in testing their limits in expanding their characterizations.WHERREAS THE STORY takes place in an earlier time, where not many Black men had opportunity to coach white kids or even in an integrated environment; of which very few even existed then. Even in the Northern urban areas, there was de facto segregation; if not by design of Law, de jurie. The story tells of the difficulties encountered by those who went first in previously uncharted waters.IF THERE IS indeed a 'message' here, it's very subtle and elemental. Put simply, it's the Golden Rule of 'love your neighbor', coupled with the notion of judging each individual on his own merit.ALTHOUGH WE KNOW that this is based on real life incidents, there is of necessity much embellishment of the story, in order to, make it into a coherent screen play. Our favourite bit concerned the coaches' daughters. In the story, the Black Girl is the one who has no interest in going out for sports. She prefers her dolls and is all female all the way. It is the White Girl who is a veritable 'Tom Boy' and shoot hops an knows all about other games, including her Father's football team.SEE WHAT WE meant about going against typecasting, or in this case, it would be 'stereotyping.'",10,0,1,27 July 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Action-Filled Spawn Of 1960's TV Brings In New Convert To Its Fold, Me!
","WE ADMIT THAT we are not as young as we once were. Who is? Time waits for no man and twice on Suundays! No matter who we are, how important or how rich, we all find ourselves as the victims of a great conspiracy; one that is perpetrated by our own parents. Their names just happen to be Mother Nature and Father Time! SO PLEASE BEAR with us while we go through some of the obligatory maneuvers that we have come to use when we write certain of these reviews. For, you see Schuiltz, that having been born in the period of time directly following World War II, we have been branded as 'Boomers' (For 'Post War Baby Boom.')and have been around to witness quite a bit of History being made by now.WHEN YOU ADD to this, the possession of a quite proficient memory that seems to retain traces of encounters with the most trivial of events, facts and pop culture; you have some combination of faculties that can oft be described as a pain in the posterior.WELL ANYWAY,HERE goes nothing! IN MAKING THIS inevitable comparison to the original TV Series, MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE (Desilu/CBS TV, 1966-73), we must come to the conclusion fairly, squarely, honestly, earnestly and sincerely. Following all of these virtues faithfully can lead us to only one conclusion. And that is, there is not ,uch resemblance to the old series.OH SURE, THE basic premise is there. The story revolves around a super secret group of covert operatives who work for some yet to be determined Department of the Federal Government. The recorded instructions always finish up with something like, '......as usual, should you decide to accept this assignment and you or any of your operatives are discovered, 'the Secretary' will disavow any knowledge of your activities. Good Luck, Chester!' (or what ever other appropriate given name applicable.) WELL, WE'VE GIVEN you the downside of this review, so it's only proper to be 'fair and balanced', as th folks over at FOX NEWS say, and tell the other side. That is if there is another side to tell you, we certainly will.SO, IT'S GOOD NEWS, folks for even though we have lamented nostalgically about 'the Good Olde Days' and sobbed a little about the passing of time and the old TV Series, we actually did like and enjoyed this movie. Once we have divorced all of the old feelings, we can measure this, or any other film, on its own merit.AS FOR ITS star and executive producer, Mr. Tom Cruise, we find his performance amidst all of this outrageous action, exploding vehicles, devious plot twists and super-energized stunts to be most competent, appropriate to this genre and even believable. (We recall that this is the same guy who worked so well dramatically with Dustin Hoffman in RAINMAN.UNFORTUNATELY, WE HADN'T seen the previous MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE outing at the time of this writing. Stubbornly, we refused to believe that there was anything of interest for us (ME!) in it.OBVIOUSLY ''WE' WERE wrong! We apologize, Mr. Cruise and I'm sorry!",8,2,5,29 December 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," The Arabian Pennsula, Crossing the Devil's Anvil, Winning the Middle East War, Only to watch the Peace Fail.
","That this film is photographed in brilliant color tones may well be important in a symbolic way as it is to the physical properties of this as a motion picture. The main character, the World War in the Middle Eastern Theatre of War against the Ottoman Turkish Empire and the treachery from his own country and his Superior Officers are indeed very complex and deserved something more than a black & white, right & wrong portrayal.The story starts out wit Mr. T.E. Lawrence, private citizen, taking a spin on his motorcycle, a short ride from which he would not return. We move to the Funeral, and like all funerals of the famous who die in tragic circumstances,* there are a lot of Big Wigs present, not to pay respects, but rather just to be seen.We also are privy to a roving reporter, stopping all the high governmental folks, asking of their knowledge of the deceased former 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Though the audience was then unaware that Director David Lean's cinematic device to both introduce us to characters from Lawrence's past, who we will be seeing again, later in the film.Among those who we meet are General Allenby(Jack Hawkins), now a Lord and an American Newspaperman & Newsreel Maker, one Jackson Bentley(Arthur Kennedy)which should be most interesting.This Mr. Bentley character is the one responsible in the film version for making Lawrence known to the world. This was essentially true, but for some reason the true name of this Press Agent for Lawrence and the Brits.The true identity of this American Newspaper Man is Lowell Thomas (1892-1981). He had been very active as a Newspaper Writer, as a Radio Newsman and a bit of a film maker, for it was two of his newsreel specials that made 'Lawrence of Arabia' into a household word. A sort of documentary compilation WITH ALLENBY IN PALESTINE AND LAWRENCE IN ARABIA (1919)was released after the War, and it started Mr.Thomas on the road to fame and fortune. (Also a very long career in Film(FOX-MOVIETONE NEWSREEL), Network Radio News and Television right up to the 1970's.(I well remember his HIGH ADVENTURE WITH LOWELL THOMAS as a 7th Grader,1958-59).Now getting back to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA(1962).A multi-faceted character would certainly require a multi-level, extra long epic sort of a film to tell the story properly. Well, they sure did that thing! We were all treated to a 216 Minute Epic which had the good sense and decency to have an INTERMISSION inserted right in the middle! And it sure seemed that the hour plus of viewing an awful lot of Sand and Dessert sure must have worked on our minds as pop sales in the lobby seemed quite brisk, indeed! As for the casting of Lawrence, Sir David Lean went with a newcomer, young, good looking and promising as an actor in Peter O'Toole. The very blonde haired and very blue eyed Mr. O'Toole gave us a T.E. Lawrence who was a sort of genius, who was out of step with the rest of the World, though Lawrence would definitely hold that it was the World that was out of step.He was highly educated and possessed super knowledge of Middle East History, Arabian Peoples, Islamic Religion and Arabian Language. It was while he was on staff a British Army HQ in Cairo that the idea of sending him on the mission to find Prince Feisel (Alec Guiness) was formulated.The eventual formation of the Arab Milita, which too forces loyal to Feisel and added more and more tribal warriors as time went by was a far cry from stories we are used to. The brutality of the dessert warfare and the frightful methods employed are most vividly portrayed. And what immediately comes to mind is a scene of an attack on a Turkish Railroad Train and its aftermath. As the attackers are 'taking inventory' of the goods on the train, a man in a bloodied up suit walks by in a seeming trance, obviously in a state of shock.The brutal blood letting scenes seem a little much at times, but it is done purposefully and not just for the sake of gratuitous violence. This David Lean was masterful in weaving a tale with some distasteful elements and maintaining a very mature, grown-up view and attitude. All the way from the start to the very end, this attitude is constant. There is no false glorification of War, nor is there any message that one could interpret as being pacifist. War is just there, we have to put up with it as best we can.The same sober realistic attitude is maintained with the alleged homosexuality of T.E. Lawrence. There are several parts of the story that sort of hint at it, but it is not mentioned, nor does the Director avoid the issue. His scene with Lawrence's being picked up and fondled by the Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer) was brutal, shocking and went far enough to get the point across; and to explain the great change in Lawrence's personality.If made by some lesser Director today, the whole sequence would be far different and much more graphic. A 'modern' movie maker would have to 'draw a picture' for the audience, for the old fashioned virtues of subtlety and implication are not in the arsenal of film weaponry of these guys.And we must make mention of the beautiful, powerful and most memorable original score from the London Phiharmonic Orchestra, which makes our sense of hearing a full partner of our enjoyment.The Verdict on Sir David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is ****1/2 (four and a half stars.) See it for the first time or see it again!NOTE: * The ceremonies like this; Military, Policeman Slain in the Line of Duty, etc., always get turned into a sort of 'Show for the Pols and Police Brass.",10,5,11,7 October 2007
JFK," Slickly Made Succession of 'What Ifs' and 'Supposes', Made as a Propaganda Piece of Hidden Persuaders, All Masquarading as a Feature Film!
","Before getting into the body of this work, let me warn the reader that all that follows is just one person's evaluation of Oliver Stone's JFK. It is just opinion, which you may find agreement, or you may reject. Likewise, Mr. Stone should have had the honesty to provide a disclaimer warning the viewer to beware of suppositions, conjecture and fantasizing.Like any Catholic, American schoolboy of Irish descent, at 14 years of age in 1960, I was very proud to see the Gentleman from Massachusetts, Senator John F. Kennedy win the Democrat Party's nomination and subsequent election to the Office of President. Little did we know that it would be just a little more than 3 years later that we would bear witness to his murder.And even though in the interim between the 2 events, I found myself steadily changing my Political Sympathies. My born and bred Democrat leanings gave way to a solid belief and active Conservative Political participation. That is to whatever small participation allowed to by a guy my age. I would be 18 at the time of the 1964 Presidential Election, at a period of time when one had to be 21 in order to vote.Anyway, even though this young Irish-German, Catholic lad was now a supporter of Senator Barry M. Goldwater(R., AZ) for the Chief Executive job, I. like most Americans, felt as if some one had kicked the living guts right out of me when President Kennedy was murdered. The events of that fateful day and the days following, left America with such a feeling of Personal as well as National tragedy, loss and grief. It was as if a member of one's own family was suddenly, and without any logical reason,taken from life on Planet Earth.This is a feeling that is quite prevalent across the board for all living and old enough to remember those days.Unlike a lot of people of my own Conservative Political persuasion, I do reject the finding of the Warren Commission. Whereas I do not buy the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin of President Kennedy, and did so by himself. There is just too much that does not compute! It made no sense then, it makes no sense now! In the years since that time in 'Camelot', I've spent most of my adult life as 'the Man', 'the Heat', 'the Fuzz', well you get it, I was a Chicago Cop for nearly 35 years, having experience in assignment=ts to the Patrol Division, the Traffic Division, the Youth Division and finally the Detective Division. This surely acted to heighten my sense of suspicion and cynicism about current events, the media covering them and how some special interests can and do slant a story to read as they want it. (Honest Injun! Don't be Shocked, Please!!) Now in spite of all of this disbelief in the findings of the Warren Commission and discounting all the other writings that have sprouted up like mushrooms after a thunderstorm, I must register a negative opinion of JFK and will be happy to give my reasons as to just why.First of all, let's start off by saying, without reservation, that JFK is a tremendous example of the exposition of the Cinematic Arts & Sciences at their very zenith of their powers. The photography, the editing, the use of nonsequitors is all so very well done as to draw the viewer into the story right from the very start. Cutting quickly between scenes and overlapping dialog adds to the certain feeling of 'reality'. Furthering this realism is the use of certain scenes which quickly follow a revelation or supposition* of a behind the scenes happening. These 'follow-up', supporting scenes, are often filmed in a diminished color, or a B & W with a dark-shadowed background. The dialog is spoken in short, fast-paced little clips in voices impersonating a well-known person involved in the whole mess.(e.g. Lyndon Johnson) This is then blurred with overlapping dialog from the previous ex positional scene. All tension is heightened by using abrupt, shrill and louder musical queues.The result is very effective as a dramatic tool, but can be very deceiving to the senses, unconsciously gaining influence on the very last part of one's thought process to fall to sensory stimulation and mood manipulation, your logic. In a real sense, a story like this actually mesmerizes the viewer. That is it has a hypnotic effect.As a work of monumental effort and mammoth efforts in the story telling tradition of the cinema, this certainly deserving of an A or even an A+ grade.But we find that there is just too much of a recurring use of innuendo, supposition, conjecture and embellishment of occurrences following the assassination. The Film Maker, Extremist Left Wing Liberal Democrat, Director Oliver Stone, bends the truth just once too often and a little too much. For these reasons, this writer cannot and will not, endorse this movie. The sum of all the contrived scenes, stacked on on top another equals just a dishonest instrument of influence.And here in Chicago, and just about anywhere else, that means it's a F*cking lie! We surely could not endorse that! Could you?",7,1,14,8 July 2007
Frozen," Better to have FROZEN Land than ASSETS
","WE MUST CONFESS that we are neither big fans of Musicals nor of the 'new' Science/Art Form of the Computer Generated Animation. We prefer our stories to be without the interruptions of song and our Animations to be of the standard SNOW WHITE/BAMBI/DUMBO/FRITZ THE CAT variety.THAT'S NOT TO say that we saw no value or 'redeeming social content' in FROZEN (Walt Disney Pictures, 2013). Begrudgingly, we admit it in front of God and everybody. We did enjoy the time invested in its viewing. (There Schultz, we said it!) AS FAR AS its rating as a musical, the marks are very high. Being that the story is done in animation rather than in the 'Real World' with 'Live' Actors, all can be near perfection. The looks and movements of the characters can be fine tuned so as to match what the production team has imagined to a 'T'.THAT BRINGS US up to the story; which is now 'Old as the (proverbial) Hills.' A family dispute between two Sisterly Princesses causes one to turn her powers to cause an Eternal Winter to descend over this otherwise peaceful, happy kingdom.THE YOUNGER PRINCESS Sister joins forces with a handsome, young Woodsman (a Commoner), his pet caribou/reindeer* and a living Snowman; whose antics and personality remind us of the CHESHIRE CAT as characterized in Disney's ALICE IN WONDERLAND (W.D.P., 1953).IT IS THEIR 'Crusade' that is successful and brings about the expected 'Happy Ending.' The team of characters somehow strangely reminds us of Dorothy's team in THE WIZARD OF OZ.THE MUSICAL SCORE and Songs are powerful, beautifully rendered and befitting of both the settings and storyline. IN many respects, the style reminds us of that which is done in WICKED, the Broadway Stage Musical.ALTHOUGH WE HADN'T read about it previously, it did stir some memories about Hans Christian Anderson (Whom we prefer to call 'Jack'.) It had all of the earmarks of one of his yarns and the Disney Studios' team did 'Jack' proud with this rendering.NOTE: * The names Caribou and Reindeer are similar, but there is as fine difference. What's that, Scultz wants to know? Well, a Reindeer is a domesticated breed of the wild Caribou.",8,2,7,6 December 2014
The Incredibles," So, Let's bring on THE UNDERMINER already! What are they waiting for?
","WE REALLY MUST be getting a trifle forgetful as we move along to the upper regions of Middle Age; but I could have sworn that this writer did a review of this some time ago. But, that's why we write things down; for it was either Confucius or Eal Der Biggers (Charlie Chan Mysteries) who said. 'Even short pencil better than long memory.'HOWEVER, ALL THAT being water 'under the Damn'*, we'll now make a valiant, albeit late attempt to add its name to our 'RYAN'S HONOR ROSTER OF FILM.' THE INCREDIBLES(Walt Disney/Pixar Animation Studios/Buena Vista, 2004) comes to the screen after some long decades of having features out of the Adventure Newspaper Comic Strips and right out of the Super Hero Comics Magazines** brought to the movie screens. Whether it was on the Silver Screen of the small electronic one in our homes, made no difference. The likes of FLASH GORDON, BUCK ROGERS,THE PHANTOM,MANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN, JUNGLE JIM, SECRET AGENT X9, PRINCE VALIANT, TIM TYYLER'S LUCK, DICK TRACY and SMILIN' JACK came from the pages of Daily and Sunday Newspapers. The less prestigious and little 'accepted' field of 'Comics Magazines*** contributed the likes of SUPERMAN, CAPTAIN MARVEL, SPY SMASHER, BATMAN, BLACKHAWK, THUNDA, TEX GRANGER, CAPTAIN America, HULK, FANTASTIC FOUR, VIGILANTE, CONGO BILL, PLASTIC MAN, SUB-MARINER, IRON MAN, THOR and your friendly neighborhood SPIDERMAN.OUR MAIN POINT in making mention of all of these features is in making the point of just how familiar these features are. Because of the truly universal recognition of all these super hero types, the genera is known to about everyone. There is little need for any elaborate origin story. Instead, the production team chose to pick out a couple of common every day problems and foibles of mankind; putting an analytical microscope on the situation and just how a Super Hero family would handle.THE MOST CARE was used in the visuals (in both the Background 'Scenery'; as well as the Character Design. Physical types of the characters and their voices were matched up with the Super Hero's name in order to make the finished product one, cohesive and believable unit; all within the premise of a Super Hero World.THE CASTING OF VOICE Actors was done to a near perfection. With the playbill headed up by Craig T. Nelson (Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible), Holly Hunter (Helen Hunter/Elastigirl) and, in an excellent sort of Comic Relief role, Samuel L. Jackson (Lucious Best/Frozone). The cast is rounded out by: Jason Lee, Dominique Louis, Teddy Newton, Jean Sincere, Eli Fucile, Maeve Andrews, Wallace and Spencer Fox; along with an extensive group of supporting players. We had special Guest Star, John Ratzenberger, as 'the Underminer', at the film's conclusion.MUCH TO OUR amusement, the twin bugaboos of Mother Nature and Father Time are gaged along with the Cartoon Worls's version of just what would happen to Super Heroes with the pre-eminence of out of control civil suits; known as the lack of torte reform in our 3 dimensional Planet Earth.THE WHOLE FAMILY of Super Powered folks gets into the act and weathers the overall crises with grace and pride in a job well-done. The Producers even do what is right at the end of the adventure; in setting up the premises for a sequel.C'MON YOU GUYS at Disney and Pixar-let's have the next installment already! It's been 5 whole long years since we were introduced to Mr. Inctedible, his Spouse, Elasti Girl and their offspring. In Hollywood Years, that's almost an Eternity!* NOTE * Yeah, we know it should be'Water Over the DAM! 'Just kiddin', Folks!NOTE ** Comics Magazine is really the formal, preferred term. It was the one used by the folks in the industry when they formed the Comics Magazine Association of America; which operated the 'Comics Code Authority', the voluntary, self policing group that left its 'seal of approval' on all comics of 'acceptable' content.

Patton," Whether Driving His Troops, Slapping 'Spin', Racing Monty or Refusing Oscar, George C.Scott Did Not Play Patton. He BECAME Patton!
","Our Dad, the late Clem Ryan (1914-74) hadn't been out to a movie in who knows how long. He had agreed to drive his Wife, our Mother Bertha(nee Fuerst) and my brother Bob at the old Highway Theatre at 63rd & Western, here in Chicago. After a lot of coaxing on the part of Ma and my youngest Brother, Dad agreed to go in with them to see the Film. Well he must have liked it, at least a little because a few days later in that same week, Dad went to see it again with other brother, Jim and our sister, Rose Mary! There was something about the film that really reached those World War II Veterans, that they came out in droves to see it, even in multiple viewings, like Pop did. And to think, Dad was an Electricuians Mate, First Class in The Navy! Of course, you don't have to be a World War II to enjoy and appreciate the film. Just about everybody we talked to gave it a favourable nod. It would be truly difficult to not like it, for it was an Epic Tale of a real flesh and blood man, who had lived just a few years before, and a man whom we should be very to have fighting on the Allied side of the Hostilities.What Director Franklin Schaffner, Producer Frank McCarthy and Associate Producer Frank Caffey did was get together and have a 'Frank' discussion about just how to proceed with this project.* Somewhere along the line they decided to make full use of as many veteran character actors available to fill out the cast. Whether or not that this was their plan, they had a large number of highly able Actors, many of which lack that 'Movie Star' 'Drop Dead' good looks. And, coincidentally, that's how most real people are in Real Life.Because of this policy, there were many Supporting Players cast in PATTON who had their greatest career roles. Some good examples are Larry Dobkin(Colonel Gaston Bell) and John Ducette(Major General Lucian K. Truscott). Both men had long careers in supporting parts in TV and the Movies, and here got a chance to display their acting skills to their largest venue of exposition.The filming done in Spain and Morocco gave a truly authentic look to the combat scenes. The production team is said to have made good use of real Soldiers from the Spanish Army to provide the large number of Military extras needed for the staging of the recreated battles.** The use of clips from FOX Movietone News Reels of the day was an excellent touch of authenticity and made for a good bridge for parts of the story.(That voice sure sounded like the real Lowell Thomas, who did narration for Movietone.)We all know how the War came out, so there is no reason to check the 'contains spoilers' box above. No? But all kidding aside, this film, in spite of the huge, epic battle scenes, great numbers of personnel(civilian & military) and the serious situations of War, is still a character driven story. And in no other area is this more apparent than the multifaceted portrait of Patton by Mr. Scott.George C. Scott, as we all know, was awarded and refused to accept his Oscar for 'Best Actor in a Leading Role'. We're truly sorry for this, as he apparently was also. He did start attending the Awards ceremonies several years later, but the TV director in charge of the telecast did his best to keep Mr. Scott's countenance off of the home screens as much as possible. The whole episode was such a damn shame! There were some truly fine and original touches put into the screenplay. We found out that the General cursed a lot, but prayed on his knees. He was a tireless and relentless driver of his troops, yet he composed poetry and recited it frequently. His was a hard personality to define and portray.The opening scene, the now famous Patton Prolog pretty well nails it when it comes to this characterization. The scene is made to give the impression of the General himself, stepping up on the theatre's stage to address his troops and the audience. The voice intonations, not unlike that of a Football Coach's half-time pep talk, made use of both the Queen's English and a lot of slang and even vulgarity.But it was this scene that was said to have captured the essence of Patton and set the tone as the Movie's 'grabber'. It was the creation of one Francis Ford Coppola, later director & screen writer of THE GODFATHER. Thank you Mr. Coppola!* Get it? A 'Frank' discussion!** The men of the Spanish Army portrayed German & Italian Troops, as well as British and American Soldiers. We wonder what old Generalissimo Francisco Franco(1892-1975) felt about that!(Hey, another Frank!)NOTE: As a side bar and point of interest, we thought it proper to point out the contributions of veteran sound effects man, Murray Spivack on the production. His long career dated back more than 4 decades. He had worked on the original KING KONG(RKO 1933).",10,1,5,29 August 2007
Rudy," A Can't Miss Film! You Gotta Pull For This Under Dog!
","We saw that a reviewer said that RUDY was....'Better Than ROCKY!', well it's really hard to say that. I mean, it's hard to compete with a Moose & Squirrel! Seriously though......It's extremely difficult to not like RUDY. After all, it contains all the elements that make for a good story. We have an underdog kid, from a Blue Collar background. This little guy dares to think and dream big.It starts out when Rudy is a young kid, but always a guy to try to keep up with the older guys. His love of Notre Dame Fotball comes about quite naturally, as his Dad, Daniel Ruttiger, Sr., proclaims that, 'We only watch one team in this house! Right Rudy!' Young Rudy takes it all very seriously by reading, studying and even listening to old recordings of the Great Notre Dame Coach, Knute Rockne.The story jumps forth abruptly to a scene where in Rudy and his friend, Pete, are at their last football practice as Seniors at Joliet Catholic High School*, Joliet Illinois. In it we learn that Rudy, though small for football, demonstrates a bull dog tenacity that has not gone un-noticed nor unappreciated by his coaches.After being discouraged by just about everybody,including a teacher-priest, we move on to see he now settles into a job at the Steel Mill where father works and his girlfriend(since childhood)plan to marry and buy a house in the town.A sudden and bitter blow comes to Rudy. His best friend, Pete,is killed in an industrial accident at the plant. Realizing that time is running out, Rudy sets out to go and enter Notre Dame, sudden like. He has not applied and is in need of remedial work. He is befriended by Father Callahan (Robert Prosky giving his usual great performance.).The good Father gets him into the nearby Holy Cross Junior College, also run by the Holy Cross Order.Well, all of this is just the beginning. The story goes on to chronicle his struggles and the friends made along the way. Jon Favreau (D-Bob, Tutor and friend) and Charles Dutton (Fortune, N.D.Stadium Maintainence Supervisor and friend) are particularly effective and enjoyable in their roles.Well can you tell what happens next? In order to get a chance at the football team, he'll need to make good enough grades and be accepted by the N.D. Admissions Office. How will he do in this quest? Well, we all kinda know that there will be success, but just how it is accomplished, that'll have to remain unwritten here.One thing that we must keep in mind. RUDY is a biopic. It, like all of the others must follow a certain formula. Just like so many of the great biographies in the past, you are sure to have the following elements. The story will open some years earlier. The subject of the story will show some traits that serve as a foreshadowing of future events.Hence, the young Lou Gerhig in PRIDE OF THE YANKEES breaks a store window with a long drive hit off the kids' sandlot baseball field. He also has a favourite baseball card of 'rookie' George Herman Ruth, who will be a team mate as Babe Ruth when Lou reaches adulthood. Knute Rockne plays a game of pick-up tackle football and immediately displays his prowess a left end (his position in NOTRE DAME'S routing of ARMY with the forward pass. Then or now, a biopic is a biopic.One thing more. RUDY benefits from some really fine cinematography. The Camera really captures the spirit and the mood.Also the sets are just about perfect from the old neighborhood, Joliet Catholic High and especially the beautiful and magnificent Campus of Notre Dame. See the film.Rent it or better yet, buy it soon! It's a keeper, guaranteed, so help me Lord! * The scenes set at Joliet Catholic High School, the Football Field and the Funeral at the Church, were all filmed at the old campus of St.Rita High School, located near 63rd Street & Western Avenue on the Southwest Side of Chicago. I can vouch for it, being an Alumnus of the joint.",10,0,1,2 July 2007
Quiz Show," 'It got to the point where the most honest thing on Television was The Wresting Matches!'....... Bob Hope (in a monologue.)
","As much as I find myself to be the Political Antithesis of the 'Sundance Kid', Johnny Hooker, Waldo Pepper and Roy Hobbs; I do admire most of his work, both in front of and behind the Motion Picture Camera. Mr. Redford' talents match up to his 'Movie Star Good Looks' and as long his directorial jobs avoid heavy handed propaganda for the New American World Socialist Party (the Michael Moore/Jimmy Carter wing of the Democratic Party); such as that LIONS FOR LAMBS (2007) project of his.However, 'Sundance' has proved that he can really give us a top rate 'Film', as opposed to just another 'Movie'. Just one cursory glance up and down his list of Directorial Credits, we find ORDINARY PEOPLE (Directorial Debut, 1980), A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992), THE LEGEND OF BEGGAR VANCE (2000) and today's victim, QUIZ SHOW (1994).The story here, in this film with the most generic sounding of titles, is that of the Television's Quiz Shows' rigging scandal of the 1950's. Accusations of TV producers' providing contestants with answers to questions that would later be asked as a part of a tensely fought on-air 'contest.' Though there had been some early rumblings about 'fix' by disgruntled Ex-Champion on TWENTY ONE, Herb Stempl, no one seemed to give any credence to such talk until there was an angry contestant on the Daytime Quiz Show, DOTTO, got angered about being double crossed. This started small, but soon now-balled into an avalanche; engulfing not only DOTTO'S and its fellow daytime 'Minor League' programs, but it also reached its tentacles up to Primetime and to THE $64,000.00 QUESTION (CBS)*, THE $64,000.00 CHALLENGE (also CBS ), but also the Jack Barry-Dan Enright production of TWENTY ONE (NBC).Having been an eyewitness of 10 years of age, I can remember well how this series made its debut, doubling the number of 'Isolation Booths' over THE $64,000.00 QUESTION'S one (1); they added the element of competition between two (2) contestants to the suspense of one contestant's sweating it out, racking his own brain in pursuit the answers. Its first few weeks on TWENTY ONE, we saw a parade of moustaches, scholarly looking spectacles and goatees; all decked out double-breasted and tweed suits. Locked in intellectual jousting, fighting to the ultimate gray matter finish, no one seemed to catch-on with the public, personality-wise . With none of these Albert Einstein and Dr. Zarkov look-alikes getting any sort of substantial advantage toward holding that coveted '21 Championship Belt', Emcee Jack Barry abruptly stopped and removed the 2 competitors; promising to bring them back at a future date. (A surefire 'Kiss of Death', if you've ever heard one!) Enter the self-taught, super nerd, Herb Stempel (John Turturro).Herb racked up an impressive string of victories over the period of several weeks, managing to eek out wins over whoever came his way. The show was gaining a following, but the seemingly colorless Mr. Stemple was just not getting over with the public. His knowledge was admirable, of course; but lacking the charisma needed in the TV Business. TWENTY ONE needed a little tweaking to get it up to the level of a Star of the First Magnitude.Bring on Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes).Hailing from NYC, as was reigning Champion Stempel, he and Professor Charles were nothing alike otherwise. Herb was a Jew, educated in NYC's Schools and at the City College of New York, employed as some sort of clerical job. On the other hand, the WASP, Van Doren, was the son of a long tenured Literary Professor at the Ivy League, Columbia University. Charles qualified as an aristocrat, a blue blooded upper crust socialite. The Van Dorens no doubt, did not cross the Atlantic on board the Mayflower, but they surely were there when the trinkets were traded for Manhattan Island.Furthermore, the youthful, handsome and very eligible Charles proved to have a wide appeal to men and even wider sex appeal to the lovely, young ladies. Either way, Van Doren's entry into the fray created a super charged interest in all things academic. His face appeared everywhere, even on the cover of Time Magazine. ** So the nation was now witness a series of long, and drawn-out matches, all of which led them to ties, no decisions and great serialized TV fun and excitement. The 'Nervous Nerd' Stempel vs. 'Prof' Van Doren was truly a 15 Round Bout, winner take all.And finally the day, or rather, the evening came along when, at last the Van Doren-Stempel feud would be decided with Herb's answering 'ON THE WATERFRONT', instead of the correct 'MARTY'. *** Mr. Van Doren began a long run in the King's Chair; one in which he lost a lot of weight and began looking frail and worn; until he also lost to whoever. Then it became readily apparent that a real problem existed and a Congressional Sub-Committee had convened with the purpose of getting to the bottom of things, PDQ.Yes, Mr. Redford, we heartily concur that this was a great production of a story that had to be told. Thanks Bob and by the way, who was this Mamie? (Mamie Van Doren, not Mamie Eisenhower, Schultz!)NOTE: * On the Radio, during its Golden Era, there had been a program titled 'THE $64 QUESTION; hence.NOTE: ** Perhaps in an indirect way, this infatuation with book learnin' was responsible for CBS TV's COLLEGE BOWL and the Local Market Franchised IT'S ACADEMIC.NOTE: *** The Question that Herb Stempel was forced to blow was 'What was the Movie that won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture?'",10,4,4,4 February 2008
The Dark Knight," Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine & Company reprise roles in what proves to be Heath Ledger tour-de-force & swan song!
","HERE, at long last (about 2 ½ Days) is our long awaited review of the latest Joke book to Celluloid adaptation, THE DARK KNIGHT (Legendary Pictures/Syncopy/DC Comics/Warner Brothers Pictures, 2008).IT is surely one Film, indeed a truly singular sensation of a Film, which has come out into general release so highly heralded and praised. We cannot find any Movie Critic anywhere who didn't give it the old 'Four Star-Don't Miss It-Best Picture of the Year' treatment.THESE are areas in which we heartily concur; for we have just this very Sunday afternoon, gone to nearby suburban Hodgkins, Illinois for a viewing at the Shopping Mall Quarry 14 Cinemas; our first viewing, but surely not our last. The movie lives up to all of the hype and praise that has been heaped upon it.. Doubtle$$ thi$ will tran$late into Top $helf, Big Time, Box Office Bu$ine$$. There should also be serious consideration for THE DARK KNIGHT as Best Picture Oscar contender; as well as the late Heath Ledger's having a great shot Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.ADAPTATION from the medium of the Comic Book and its more pretentious and newly found cousin, the Graphic Novel, is what we wish to take up in our dissertation/review/diatribe(?); for you see, Schultz, it is the main area of concern and bone of contention, with this and any and all comics adaptations to film & TV.BATMAN by Bob Kane, of course, has been around ever since the feature's initial appearance in National Comics Publications' monthly publication, Detective Comics, number 27. His coming on the scene about a year after the same company's Action Comics # 1 premiered Jerry Siegel (Writer) & Joe Shuster's (Artist) SUPERMAN. These events were followed by Fawcett Publications' CAPTAIN MARVEL in the monthly Whiz Comics. Soon we had a veritable deluge of super characters from publishers such as Timely* (Sub-Mariner, Human Torch and Captain America), MLJ** (Shield, Wizard and Black Hood), Quality Comics (Plastic Man, Blackhawk and Will Eisner's The Spirit) and Fox Features (The Blue Beetle).IT was in this initial period that the character of Batman was early on established as being a dark and avenging denizen of the night. This shouldn't be rocket science, Schultz, as most all bats (except the fruit eating ones of Southeast Asia, are in fact, nocturnal in their habits. Ergo, any guy who has 'Bat' as a descriptive part of his name or title, must be active during the nights and do his catching up on his beauty sleep while the old Sun is high in our daytime skies. This trait was most consistent during the earliest times, when 'The Batman' was still a sort of freelancing and outlawed vigilante type. As he became an accepted, even official member of the Law Enforcement community, his appearances were as frequently set in daylight as in the late P.M. to early A.M. time periods.OUR film is set in this period and even to its conclusion, it is so; as Batman is still seen as a sort of wanted, extra-legal, independent criminal destroying privateer. If one remembers that at the conclusion of Director Tim Burton's BATMAN (Gruber Peters/Polygram/Warner Brothers, 1989) Batman was already an accepted part of the Gotham City Police Department; the beautifully crafted fade-out being a fine and memorable iconic image with the Caped Crusader's being perched on a high ledge of a great skyscraper while watching a very clearly visible Bat-Signal.AS for their treatment of the Joker, himself, we must vote this as a split decision. It was okay as far as the white faced GREEN HAIRED freak's being a sociopath of the worst ilk. In the his very first appearance in Batman Comics # 1, Spring 1940, Joker's occupation was established as a contract killer and definitely one who was indeed very happy in his work. But, from we sit, this characterization of the Joker has missed the boat in trappings; although certainly not in the personality.THEY certainly got the behavioral and anti-social attitudes of a homicidal maniac down pat; as was demonstrated most admirably right from the opening hold-up sequence. The production crew did a fine job in continuing Joker's bad reputation as a nasty, insanely ego-maniacal, cruelly motivated career criminal leader.THEY seemed to ignore totally the old Joker modus operandi of having 'theme crimes' and giving out clues to Batman and Police Commissioner Gordon; as was a long standing practice in the comics, the Batman TV Series (1966) and the Batman Feature (1989 again). There is just no mention of any sort of these 'colorful' crimes, whatsoever.OVERALL, this is a fine film. It meets two basic criteria to which all should be held. First, it is fine for the non-comic book crowd. Secondly, it can definitely stand on its own as an independent and self-reliant story; a definite Must See! AS for Batman and Me, we've been old friends ever since the Summer of 1957, when this 10 year old discovered 2 comics books:World's Finest Comics, No. 90, dated Sep/Oct '57 and the second comic was Batman Comics No. 110, September, 1957; which was a real watershed of comics stories and a great primer for any new Batman reader. It contained three 8 page stories. They were the cover featured 'The Phantom Batman', in which an all too common freak accidents rendering him temporarily physically metamorphosed. The other two stories were much more interesting and informative. The middle story, 'The Secret of Batman's Butler' gave our first in depth look at faithful Alfred. But it was the opening story which was the best. In 'The Crime of the Month Club', we were introduced to the Joker and his Criminal Shenanigans.FROM that moment on, I knew that I wanted to be Batman.POODLE SCHNITZ!!",10,4,10,20 July 2008
Alice in Wonderland," High Charged and Super Fancy Rendering of the old, oft Psycho-analytical, Literary Wet Dream.
","THIS IS ONE story that is most likely widely familiar to a really wide cross section of the public. It had been adapted seemingly countless times to both the Big Screen of the Cinema, to the Small Picture Tube in our Living Rooms. Each we've seen has been markedly different from the next; each having strong points and corresponding frailties.OTHER THAN TODAY'S honored title, ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Disney/Buena Vista, 2010), the two versions that immediately come to our mind are Paramount Pictures' 1933 All Star Spectacular and the Walt Disney (by the real,original Walt) 1951 full length animated extravaganza. This latest version would seem to combine certain strong suit features of both; while still managing to throw in liberally portioned amounts of additional elements of its own.WHILE THE EARLIEST of these three, ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Paramount, 1933)had the novelty of using just about everyone at Paramount at that particular time; much of its desired 'Star Power' is neutralized with the use of heavily crafted costume, make up and intricate and sometimes frighteningly gross latex masks. The only one not affected would have to be young Miss Charlotte Henry; whose delicate beauty and youthful innocence are the best features of the film.ALL OF THE others are acting out roles in virtually anonymous disguise to such a degree that their parts may well be classified as that of 'voice only' actors. Folks such as Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, W.C. Fields, Roscoe Ates and Jack Oakie may be identified by way of voice recognition and credits in the cast.SIMILARLY, OUR NEW version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND (Disney, 2010) does have a most formidable line up of talent in its cast; which, of course, is not limited by any Studio Star System; that having become as extinct as the Dodo Bird, the Passenger Pigeon or Photomat. Being mainly voice over, the credits prove to be more important than ever; particularly with some portrayals, such as Mr. Christopher Lee as the Jabberwocky.WHILE OUR 2010 version brings us the physical appearance of the various characters that would appear to have been very closely adapted from the old book illustrations, they still tend to gravitate toward the bizarre tastes of Director Tim Burton. There is none of the old tried and true Walt Disney principle of having the animated characters have at least some resemblance to their individual voice creators. Hence, we can see this in evidence in the physical appearance of The Mad Hatter (Ed Wynn), The March Hare(Jerry Colona), White Rabbit (Bill Thompson) and The Queen of Hearts (name here).THIS VERSION HAS all of the modern cinematic wonders going for it; what, with digital stereo sound, big screen (even Imax version), full digitally rendered color, various computer generated special FX and 3 Dimensional vision.* FOR ALL ITS supercharged features, we find the movie going experience just so-so. It was okay, but no future classic. Like any true-blue member of the Post World War II Baby Boom, we prefer Mr. Disney's 1951 animated version.WE GUESS THAT this makes us just a trifle jaded; or maybe just getting old. Well, that's not bad; when you consider the alternative! NOTE: * Ah 3-D! How well we remember the 3D craze of our youth; and that's over a half century ago! Then we had 3D Movies, 3D Comic Books everywhere. Well, as the old French proverb says; 'The more things change, the more they stay the same!' Just think that one over, Schultz!",7,0,1,29 April 2010
The Artist," Fine Story, Outstanding Cast and Surprisingly Good Music & even Great Hoofing!
","IN A SORT OF all out display of a story about a silent Hollywood learning to talk and the problems encountered by those caught in the middle; the producers chose to do a real retro work and make a silent film filmed in glorious black and white. We couldn't have agreed with their choice more; for it had a great tendency to draw the audience into the story in the proverbially hook, line and sinker intensity.THE TOPIC WAS one taken from many real life stories from the late 20's early 30's scene in tinsel town; although there is no one real life person's story being portrayed here. The subject matter had, indeed, been told before on the screen. We had been offered such fare as WHAT PRICE Hollywood? (RKO, 1932*) and no less than three versions of A STAR IS BORN having been produced over the span of some forty years.**HOWEVER SEEMINGLY TIMEWORN and 'old hat' the storyline may seem to be, the production team manages to render it all new and fresh, right before our non color stimulated eyes and their corresponding non sound-wave inundated ear drums. This feature, alone,gave the audience a sort of unique slant on the events unfolding.THEY ALSO MANAGED to threw in just enough new and different elements to make it all new. Just when a viewer believes he has it all figured out, we find out NOT!THERE WAS NOT one area of the production that does not fall short of the ultimate degree of quality. In every department, near perfection was achieved. The style of direction, the mime-like acting, the general appearance of the actors and the fine use of a strict Art Decco motif in set decor and even in the title cards, all ring true and equal possibly the best recreation of a silent feature film ever.*** IN ADDITION TO all there previously mentioned elements, this film never seems to take itself too seriously; never going too long without the injection of a little dose of humor. The inclusion of the trained dog, indulging us with some well executed tricks and the use of the name of 'Peppy Miller' as the new star's name, while the cast includes real life actress, Penelope Miller, in a major role.WITH THE RELEASE of this Academy Award Winner, THE ARTIST, the Hollywood set has given us what it so seldom does, something original!OTE:* This RKO feature starred Constance Bennett,Lowell Sherman and a young Nr. Neil Hamiton, who is best remembered for work in the sunset years of his life as Commissioner Gordon on the 'BATMAN' TV Show (Greenway/20th Century-Fox/ABC TV, 1966-68).NOTE:** Three very familiar Technicolor versions came out in 1937, 1954 and 1976, staring,respectively: Janet Gaynor & Frederic March, Judy Garland & James Mason, Barbara Streisand & Chris Christopherson. Yes, the 3rd release did somewhat depart from Hollywood for the Music business.NOTE:*** Some may argue that THE ARTIST includes a soundtrack with music, sound effects and a brief run of dialog, making it a Sound Movie. We argue that it is still essentially a Silent; much in the same way that Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES sported music, sound fx and brief on screen voices.",10,2,4,14 May 2012
Rocky," Stallone goes the distance in Life as ROCKY did the same on the Big Screen!
","The Boxing Film has long been a favored genre of the Hollywood output. Dating back to the earliest days, there has been a fascination with the fictionalized accounts of the 'Sweet Science. Hence, we have been treated to the likes GENTLEMAN JIM (Errol Flynn), THE GOLDEN BOY(William Holden), THE CHAMP & its Remake(Wallace Beery/Jon Voigt). We have also seen the Darker Side of Life in CHAMPION (Kirk Douglas), THE HARDER THEY FALL (Humphrey Bogart,Rod Steiger, Jan Sterling) and REQUIAM FOR A HEAVYWEIGT (Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason & Mickey Rooney). Boxing has long been a metaphor for life itself and so this screenplay represented the status of Mr. Stallone's own life and Acting Career. At 30 years of age himself, he held out to giving an okay to Producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler to do the film. The producers wanted Robert Dinero for the role, but old Sly was banking on this project's being his own long shot,to put his own career into the Success column.This is not supposed to be much of a film, this ROCKY, it is not a Blockbuster or any 'critically acclaimed' High Brow slice of Cinematic Art. But, lo and behold, the story holds onto the audience like a Pit Bull! All can watch it together as a Family Unit.And though it contains some very graphic and violent scenes in the Prize Ring, all is acceptable. Great care was taken here (as it was in the following Rocky Movies) to present a long, drawn-out Championship Bout, which would be somewhat fanciful, yet remain faithful to the realism that was a hallmark of the film.The film is shot mainly on location in Philly. The cityscapes selected gives the viewer a look of beauty.We all have those bumps in the road of our daily lives.Sly was right, for he was the guy for his own Script*. He did not have to 'get into this character's head, because this character originated in the fertile Stallone imagination. In one sense, Rocky was Sly. Some in the Boxing Fraternity were critical of the film's portrayal of the physical training and the lack of emphasis on sparring. With this one criticism considered and dismissed as minor, we can fully appreciate the scenes of roadwork, resistance exercise, speed and heavy bag work. The running scene done on the waterfront is of particular note, as Stallone really went all-out, hitting high gear in sprinting, with the water and the docked ships providing a most picturesque back drop.** Tallia Shire played Adrian, a shy girl, who has grown up in a very quiet manner. She has not had much, if any, social life. She yearns for fulfillment in a drab existence of caring for self and working in a pet store, as a sort of female roustabout/cage cleaner/animal keeper. She lives in the same old family house with her older brother, Paulie.Paulie (Burt Young) is a heavy set, apparently powerhouse of a guy, who is employed in a meat rendering plant. He is greatly dissatisfied with things as they are and constantly shows these feelings. For example, he wants to better himself by getting a job like Rocky's as a collector for the 'Juice Man', Gazzo, powerfully portrayed by the very talented, the Late Mr. Joe Spinnell.*** Carl Weathers brings the Heavyweight Champion of the World to life. His portrayal is as right on the mark as his muscular physique and obvious athleticism is obvious. (He was a College Footballer as well as having done a stint in the NFL with the Oakland Raiders. He was a linebacker.) Carl's 'Appolo Creed' is at once cunning, serious, and flamboyant. He is at once a dedicated, Spartanesque athlete, but also a business man. He is the one who makes the Match, even insists on his opponent be Rocky Balboa,'The Italian Stallion.' Other cast members include: Thayer David appeared as, the splendidly dressed Promoter Miles Jergens. Tony Burton is Apollo's trainer. We also have a great number of other well traveled supporting players in the cast. Two of our personal favourites are,Billy Sands (veteran of TV's SGT. BILKO and McHALE's NAVY) is cast as a Ring Announcer and George O'Hanlon (for years he was Joe McDoakes in all of those Warner Brothers Comedy Shorts as well as the voice of Hanna-Barbara's George Jetson on THE JETSONS, both on TV as well as the Feature Film.) Sylvester Stallone is certainly a loyal guy, as he has several friends and family in the film . His brother Frank Stallone, Jr. has his vocal group in it as the street singers('You guys get better every year!') and Frank Stallone, Sr., their father appears as a time keeper. Why even Rocky's Dog, Butkus was the real life pet of Mr.Sly's.ROCKY has been called an old fashioned 'B' Picture.**** Well, maybe so, but if it is true, let Hollywood give us more, and more and more and more..........................., en ad infinitum! * The right guy, indeed! The whole story would seem to be an allegory, a metaphor for Life Itself, and in this case, Sly's Life and Career.** The action of the scene appears to have been augmented by some certain camera movement, making the whole sequence even more spectacular! *** The late Mr.Joe Spinnell had such fine talent. Having been discovered at an open casting call for THE GODFATHER by Francis Ford Cappola.**** The story was inspired by real life incidents. Chuck Wepner, as Journeyman Heavyweight Boxer, got a chance to fight Mohammed Ali for the Title. It was March 24, 1975 in Cleveland.",10,1,1,25 July 2007
Some Like It Hot," In making a Comedy Film, Nobody's Perfect! But Billy Wilder & Company got pretty damn close!
","The Great Famous as well as the Great Infamous occurrences in a nation's history are and always will be looked upon as subjects worthy of a film treatment. Whether an incident were to be filmed from a story and its screenplay form written directly for the screen or an adaptation of a Novel, a Short Story or a Stage Play, they are an important element of formulating our image of our World. Right or wrong, it is a fact of life and one that we must learn to live with.A good example of just what we are driving at is the occurrences of October 26, 1881 in Tombstone, Arizona. Known as 'The Gunfight at O.K. Corral', the incident is probably the best known single shoot-em-up incident in the History of the Old West. Countless references are made to it in our Western Movies, be they Major Motion Pictures or the 'B' Picture Series of the Matinée & Bubble Gum Set.Equally as familiar to the movie going public and probably the best known example of Urban Gangster violence of the 'Lawless Prohibition/Gangster Era, 'The St.Valentine's Day Massacre' has been given Film treatment many times. It is featured in the Rod Steiger's Starring Title Role as AL CAPONE (Allied Artists, 1959).Director Roger Corman gave us THE ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE (Los Altos Productions / 20th Century-Fox, 1967); devoting the entire 100 minutes of screen time to the behind the scenes incidents leading up to it and to the Great Mass Murder.With Ben Gazzara in the title role, we had CAPONE (Santa Fe Productions/ 20th Century-Fox, 1975), also which had the Massacre and its preparation and aftermath as central events in the story.With the dramatic come the comedies, spoofs, comedians, the social commentators and the satirists. There surely would be a comedy that would at least make mention of the Massacre in passing.And it happened. Producer/co-Writer/Director Billy Wilder gave us SOME LIKE IT HOT (Ashton Prod./Mirisch Corp.-United Artists, 1959). To a hilariously great script, Directot Wilder added plenty of Hollywood Star Power in Miss Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Tony Curtis and Mr. Jack Lemmon. In supporting position, we saw the likes of veteran, old pros like Joe E. Brown (as Millionaire Osgood Fielding III), George Raft (as 'Spats' Colombo), Pat O'Brien (as Detective Mulligan), Nehimiah Persoff (as Little Boneparte), Joan Shawlee (Sweet Sue), Billy Gray (Sig Pokikoff), George E. Stone (Toothpick Charley), Mike Mazurki (Spats' Henchman), Dave Barry (Beinstock), Harry Wilson (Spats Henchman), Beverly Wills (Delores), Barbara Drew (Nellie), Edward G.

Two struggling and apparently over-sexed Musicians, Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) narrowly missed being arrested in a Police Raid on a Speak Easy run by big time Hoodlum, 'Spats' Columbo (George Raft). Obtaining a 'Gig' to play t the University of Illinois Dance in Champaign-Urbana, over 100 miles to the South of Chicago. Borrowing a Car from a Girlfriend of Joe's, they have the Bad Luck of being present at the Clark Street Garage when the mass killings take place.In order to escape being snuffed-out for witnessing the deed, the two masquerade as Women and join up with A Band made up of all Lady Musicians and (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Singer, Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe). The Band is heading out of the snowy, Chicago Winter for the 'safety' of Sunny, Florida. That is 'safety', until 'Spats' and his Boys, show up in the Sunshine State for the Convention of 'Friends of Italian Opera', which is code for the Crime Syndicate! The fun continues.The film is wild, fast paced and cleverly written. It has guaranteed laughs through-out. Mr. Wilder and Company, have constructed a sort of cross between the old James Cagney/Humphrey Bogart feature, THE ROARING TWENTIES (Warner Brothers, 1939) and a Mack Sennett Silent Keystone Comedy. They get us Laughing and keep it that way.The filming used the City of Coronado in Suburban San Diego, as the location doubling for an unavailable State of Florida. Both the beautiful Coronado Beach and the 1920's styled Coronado Hotel were put to use to great effect.And just one more thing before we signoff for now. Of all the veteran players appearing in the movie, it is the fine performance of Mr. Joe E. Brown which steals more than his share of the film. Joe E. Brown had his hey day in a series of comedies done I the 1930's and had been relegated to supporting riles since then. The role of eccentric Millionaire Osgood Fielding III, who finds himself attracted to 'Daphne', the Bull Fiddle Player (Jack Lemmon).And it is Joe E. Brown who speaks the memorable last line of dialogue, which is, no, no! I won't tell! If you don't know, buy it or rent it; but see it! Don't wait another Day!",10,13,18,28 December 2007
Thor," What, No Helmet Laws in Asgaard?
","WELL IT IS surely with mixed feelings that we come away with after viewing THOR (Marvel/Paramount, 2011). On the one hand it is an excellent, comic derivative story with outstanding fx, attractive & able cast and fine, exciting musical score. The only question at film's end is, is this the Thor that we remember from our youth? RATHER THAN STARTING off the proceedings with (as they say in the Comics Price Guide)the usual 'Origin and 1st Appearance', we are transported to a sort of background history of the 'Immortals' of Asgaard and how they came to be deified by the ancient Norsemen. We learn of petty family jealousies and intrigues of the sons of Odin. The scenario brings us in contact with an array of twists and dramatic devices that would do even old Will Shakespeare proud. It doth appeareth that be it on Earth or in a mythological Viking Heaven, Royalties is sure bleeped up! THE GREAT THOR stories that we enjoyed so were more of a mixture of this Ancient Norse Mythology with standard Super Hero fare. Thor may have been the god of thunder; but he still had a dual identity, an 'Alter-Ego', if you will. In his case, it was that of frail, lame Dr. Donald Blake. The good physician came about his new identity quite by accident; by picking up the hammer of Thor, which bore a warning sign. It was something along the lines of 'Whosoever Picketh Up the Hammer of Thor Will Become The God of Thunder!'* Well, Dr. Don did and then did! ALL THE WHILE, there was already the quietly loving, Nurse Jane Foster; who was so often given thought balloons filled with such typically melodramatic Stan Lee-esque thought dialog as 'Oh Dr. Blake, if you only knew how I've longed to be held in your arms!' You see, Jane Foster was already known to Dr. Blake; though not in the Biblical sense, of course.TO THIS OLD, now long in the tooth, comics aficionado, the script and the occurrences bear a strong resemblance to the 'TALES OF ASGAARD' stories that Mr. Stan Lee ran as a secondary, back-up feature to the main THOR Story in his JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY Comics magazine.* The stories as we recall, were exciting, even epic in nature. The involved happenings surrounding Thor, Odin and Loki; but all happening in 'the old sod'. They were well illustrated (by superior comics draftsman,Gene Colan, I think). The illustrated continuities even had somewhat of a resemblance to the old PRINCE VALIANT Sunday Pages by Harold Foster or Alex Raymond's FLASH GORDON.ONE VERY MARVEL-TYPE occurrence was the characterization of the four of Thor's deputy warriors. They all had diverse, feisty and wholly 3 dimensional personalities. This had long been a Marvel Comics Hallmark.WELL, WE SURE CAN hardly wait for the CAPTAIN America movie next month and for next year's THE AVENGERS. Maybe they can manage to tie up any loose ends and make a little more comic book sense; especially with the addition of Captain America, the Hulk, Iron Man and others.IN CLOSING LET us leave you with a couple of public pleas. Please give Thor a shave and put his helmet where it belongs, on top of those golden locks!NOTE: * That's right, JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY was the original title of the mag that was to be the Thunder God's home. Originally it was one of those Weird Science/Fantasy anthologies; which were so popular in the 50's. With the '60's Super Hero Revival in full swing, the title was eventually changed to THE MIGHTY THOR.",7,1,3,4 June 2011
The Untouchables," A Brian DePalma Gangster Tale or '....Another Fine Ness!'
","From an unknown and forgotten man, the publication of the novel, THE UNTOUCHABLES by one Mr. Elliot Ness and the collaborator, Oscar Fraley, brought real, 1950's style fame to the then retired G Man. From the novel, to the 2 parter of 'The Untouchables'which was a presentation of The Westinghouse DESILU PLAYHOUSE on CBS.(Later released as a feature film titled THE SCARFACE MOB) It was the big success and immediate popularity of the Lead, Robert Stack, that warranted making a series of it on the ABC TV Network. After a measley 5 seasons and only l18 episodes, THE UNTOUCHABLES was given the old ax and went into syndicated re-runs.Well nigh well 25 years passed and it finally came to pass that that the public would be receptive to a retelling of the Chicago during Prohibition Saga. After all, it should be a natural. The movie going crowd seemed to liker those Gamgster shoot-em-ups, and especially if they involved old 'Snorkey', you know 'Scarface', Big Al, that is. Big Al as in Capone, would be the antagonist.The film opens up with the Musical Theme being about as different as it could be from the Nelson Riddle theme and incidental music of the series.The film's score by 'Spahhetti Western Veteran', Ennio Morricone, is shrill, annoying and highly pitched. It sets the tone of the production.The violence is highly graphic and even could be called gory. This has been a trademark of Director, Brian DePalma's. Explosiives, gun play and the old fashioned blades are pictured in use and afterward. We of course expect such, due to the nature of the film's subject matter. It sort of borders on 'gross' at times. This is not a real criticism of Mr. DePalma's work as the TV Series was none too subtle itself.The Chicago setting is well used, what with the downtown and neighborhood locale, s put to best use in giving a Prohibition Era Gangster and Great Depression time feel. The wardrobe, costumes and automobiles used serve to amplify the old settings even more. They have actually created a much more beautiful Depression than the the original, but that is the nature of the Technicolor Film process.(It seems that ordinary items in every day settings look much better on the screen, even in home movies.) The cast of Kevin Kostner, Sean Connery, Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia make a fine group of Law Men, albeit rather unorthodox ones at that. Robert DiNero seems to have a fine time with his interpretation of Al Capone, with costuming making him appear to be more bulky. He uses his acting abilities to best advantage to project an ego that would do better in living up to the 'Big AL' moniker than any height or girth.From a lot of what has been written about Mr. Ness and his exploits by different people, it would appear that of the characterizations of the boss Treasury Man by Mr. Robert Stack and Mr Kevin Costner, it would appear that Kevin's 'Ness' was a tad more like the real guy, who is said to have been somewhat of a publicity hound.Please allow me to make mention of the part of the crooked Chicago Alderman who tries to bribe Ness on behalf of the Crime Syndicate. It was a brief part, but an important one. It was well done and sort of over the top. The actor in the role was the Late Mr. Del Close, a veteran of Chicago's Second City and was considered to be the High Guru of Improvisational Theatre.Sometimes we ask ourselves, just what was such a big deal about this Ness and His Boys? After all, these are the characters who our old buddy in the funny papers, Snuffy Smith, refers to as 'Revenooers'!",8,1,3,2 August 2007
The Godfather: Part III," Is it 'Third Time's A Charm' or maybe 'Called Third Strike?' Paging GODFATHER, Party of Three!
","THERE IS an old, time worn bit of conventional wisdom that goes something like: 'They' say that a sequel to a movie is never as good as the original!'WELL, WHOEVER 'They' are, and 'They' are eternally making these absolute truisms, always have and always do so. 'They' would certainly done themselves well to dial it down a bit, remembering what 'They' said about absolutes; namely that:'They say that there are no absolutes!' (Except of course the absolute truth that there are no absolutes. Did 'they' say that? Absolutely!WELL, SCHULTZ, you certainly do get the point; being that most of the many sequels that are made, do not measure up to the first entry into what mostly always spawns a veritable series of motion pictures. (Just consider for a moment, if you please, the likes of JAWS II, ROCKY II, DEATH WISH II, BATMAN II, TOPPER TAKES A TRIP, HALLOWEEN 2 and even APPOLLO 13!* AND WHAT about perhaps the all time cheapie, spin off in SON OF KONG; which could exist to cheaply recoup some of the exce$$I've budgetary buck$ of Pop's story in KING KONG (RKO Radio Pictures, 1933). THERE HAVE been a few notable exceptions to the rule, though. The first that pops into my fatigued mind is FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1931) being followed a full four years later by BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1935). (Notice that back in the 'Good Olde Days', Hollywood seems to be a little more trusting of us, the great, unwashed masses and actually did make variation on titles. They didn't think they necessarily needed something like DONDI II; in order to convey the message that a picture is a sequel.)AND SO too, that THE GODFATHER's being followed by THE GODFATHER: Part 2, represented only the second time in our memory that the sequel actually was better than the original; following these two James Whale FRANKENSTEIN Pictures, was a delightful continuation and fulfillment of the originals' story line.SO NOW let's f-a-s-t f-o-r-w-a-r-d a trifle. Hey, many more $how Bu$ine$$ Mega Buck$ could we 'possibly' extricate with more actors being present. The wild one of idea were, that falsely reasoned that there should be continued success with the sequels. BBUUZZZZT! (Our game show buzzer) WRONG!!THE LUCK ran out as Puzo, Coppola and Paramount went with GF#3! Why, you asked? What went wrong?FIRST OF ALL, 1990 take away 1974=16 years between numbers two and three. (Sounds a little like toilet training.) A lot had changed in Hollywood; as well as in the Real World. Finding clever ways to bump-off the enemies was taking some inventive, albeit strange twists. For example, we gotta go to tie in the Catholic Church with a contrived storyline involving the murder of the Popntif! Connie Corleone (Miss Tallia Shire) becomes a combination Hit Man & Lucritia Borgia! People get to hear Opera performed in their own language; being Italian (in Italy, yet)! THIS IS not to say that the movie doesn't offer anything; for many of its sequences are interesting, but somehow don't seem to mesh very well into a smooth running gangland saga. Youmg Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) is well cast as the illegitimate prince and pretender to the Corleone Family throne; but his character seems to be almost cut from the same cloth as an Agent 007. His skills at pulling off the hit of the really 'Bad Guy' Gangster, Joey Zasa (Joe Montenga) are really well developed for a young guy; with his tactics being similar to those being studied at West Point.IT HAS been said that the Godfather author, the late Mr. Mario Puzo, was working on a fourth installment of the Corleone Family story when he passed away in 1999. If so, we have no doubt that we will see how the Family Business runs with young Don Vincenzo (Mr. Garcia) calling the shots.THEN MAYBE Director Coppala can take a new road and bring us a GODFATHER TV Series; perhaps a Sitcom. How about Charlie Sheehan as the wisecracking Don Corleone with Rip Taylor as a Funny Consiglieri; just for Comic Relief! FOR Remember, Schultz, we Americans, that is all real, right thinking Americans love our Gangster Pictures, even the lesser ones. NOTE * Me friend Schultz and meself still haven't seen APPOLLO 13. We've strong feelings that we should see APPOLLO 1 to 12 before hand.",7,0,1,14 October 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," Think! If George Bailey hadn't been born: Harry wouldn't go to the Ice Pond!Martini would run a Pizzeria!Gower would've sold to CVS!Violet would've married Uncle Billy.....
","WHILE MAKING IT yet another early Winter's eve spent with the handy work of Mr. Frank Capra, Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, et al, it suddenly occurred to us that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (Liberty Films/RKO Radio Pictures, 1946) is one film that has a most checkered history. Inspite of the exalted position of preeminence that it has occupied for some thirty or so years now, as hard as it may seem to believe, the movie was not a success at the time of its original release.WE CAN RECALL viewing it for the first time. It was while in Junior High (in the 7th Grade), circa 1958. The temperate zone setting was very appealing; rather than being set in the warm and sunny Southern California, Mediterramean clime that characterize so many cinematic works. This was a most friendly way of getting the attention of this kid, here (that's me, Schultz)! I really identified with it.SO, WE CAN now magically fast forward our time line about 12-15 years to the early 1970's. It was during this period that our subject film was wrongly thought to be in Public Domain. Without the benefit of copyright protection,it would be open season on this or any other movie. Every and any print of it could be, and was shown over just about all of the commercial TV stations in the land; as well as those which come under the umbrella of (everybody bow their heads) the Public Broadcasting System.* THE MEGA DOSSAGE of exposures to the Film, rather than wearing out its welcome with the Public, surprisingly served to permanently cement its endearment to the masses. In much the same manner that all the films and characters which are numbered among all that is the Walt Disney Legacy, the characters and happenings of this screen story are all second nature to us now.HAVING SUCCEEDED IN capturing the affection and imagination of the public at large, the characters and storyline would surely invite imitation; for after all, they say that...'Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.' Yet, there has never been a movie which we could say with any reasonably high degree of certainty that was an attempt to emulate the story and the spirit of the film.WE SAY THAT there was no imitation of the movie; a statement that you may well be disputing. And believe us when say we can hear you when you say, 'What about that made for TV movie, IT HAPPENED ONE Christmas (Daisy Productions/Universal TV/ABC TV Network,1977), which was a starring vehicle for Miss Marlo Thomas and Wayne Rogers; with support from Cloris Leachman and Orson Wells!!IT REQUIRED A Sex Change operation for the principals as Mary was now the main character and head of the Savings & Loan; with the Angel's role being consigned to the feminine side with Cloris Leachman (relpete with an annoying & phony Cockney accent) being called 'Clara', instead of Henry Travers' name of 'Clarence'! (Clever these Americans!) WELL, WE SAID it before and we'll stick by our statement. This is not an imitation or derivative of the original. It's an outright piece of Plagiarism, plain and simple! It may have been do one all legal like and above board, but it's still Plagiarism. Just screen it and see that the script has been a carbon copy of the Capra Film.AS PERHAPS AN unintended, though extremely beneficial, consequence of all of this super dosage of this variety of what has been described as 'Capra-corn'**, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE eventually rose to the pinnacle of success as America's Favourite Film of the Christmas Holiday Season. In doing so, Mr. Capra's pet project managed to supplant the former Yuletide Christmas favourite, WHITE Christmas (Paramount, 1955). (Yuch!!!!!!!!!!!! But that, my dear buddy Schultz, is another story!)NOTE: * We prefer to refer to it as the POLIT BUREAU SYSTEM.NOTE: ** It has been said that while it was true, that the copyright to the Movie had not been renewed therefore it was legitimately considered to be in Public Domain, the Music in the Film was a different story. In this case, the impossible was accomplished, with 'all the Horses being put back into the Barn!' The Music Copyright lead to having a single copyright owner (Republic Pictures). Hence, we see the movie usually twice a year on NBC.",10,1,5,12 December 2009
Jersey Boys," Borrowing From What Is Being Borrowed (read on)
","HAVING BEEN A JUNIOR in High School when SHERRY debuted in the Autumn of 1962 and having seen both JERSEY BOYS as well as seeing a recent concert by Frankie Valli, one would think that we'd know everything that was coming in this picture. Wrong, we did not.PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR, Mr. Clint Eastwood, took the successful Stage Play and had it adapted into something which was at once the same, yet very different. Using the medium of film to expand the 'stage' on which the story is presented, enabled the development of the story to take a more realistic course than the stage musical could possibly have done.THE STORY IS framed with anecdotal stories from the 'old neighborhood'; revealing the boys to have been involved with a lot of illegal; activity and indeed, were familiar with organized crime figures. The latter was represented by the character of Gyp De Carlo (Christopher Walken).THE BOYS OWN brushes with the law are represented by a botched burglary; which young Frankie (John Lloyd Young) manages to get cut loose from due to in Court testimony of his mentor, Tommy De Vito (Vincent Piazza). Tommy De Vito does do time for the crime and we learn that jail seems to be a way of life here.THE SCENARIO HAS plenty of domestic situations, backstage show biz stuff, outstanding drama and relevant humor. The direction that the story takes always moves the action along; without ever lapsing into any superfluous or irrelevant scenes or situations.ALTHOUGH THAT WE have a prime example of the filming of a legitimate stage play and the dramatic license involved; as well as the application of movie techniques, the production team did not stop there.IN A SORT OF reversal of the filming process and use of camera techniques, the screenplay opted to, in turn borrow stage methods in providing both narrative and exposition. For example, the characters turn and directly address us, through talking to the camera's eye.THE MOVIE DOES diverge from the norm on several other points. First, there are no opening credits. All cast members, film crew, producer/director personnel and technicians receive their billing at movies conclusion.AND, MUCH IN the manner of the Broadway Stage's having the players in the cast to take a bow and receive their appreciation from the audience, the cast is brought out once more for our approval. This is accomplished with a ensemble production number, with all doing a dance to Four Seasons' standards.THESE TECHNIQUES REMIND us very much of those employed by that 24 year old, boy genius, Orson Wells, used in his CITIZEN KANE (RKO, 1941). We suppose that this makes Mr. Eastwood the preeminent Director in the business.WITH THIS NOTION we do heartily concur. If you haven't yet seen it, do so soon. Tell 'em we sent you.",10,2,5,12 July 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Collision of Cultures, Saving Face While Engineering a Bridge in the Jungle,under influence of what has come to be known as 'the Stockholm Syndrome.'
","HAVING viewed THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI (Horizon Pictures/Columbia, 1957) for the first time on the Telly as a 18 year old adolescent, the experience was not nearly as moving or as impressive that it would be some years later. This is due to several diverse, but equally compelling, causes.FIRST of all, it was on Network TV, the American Broadcasting Company Television to be precise. The year was 1966, long before we would have referred to a Movie as 'Film'. Just about every one who had to be content with viewing the edited and commercially interrupted movie on the B & W Admiral, Zenith or Motorola that sat in the 'Fron Troom' (Chicago-ese word for Living Room; see also 'Front Room').BEING so emotionally battered and culturally & economically deprived; one has to wonder how we ever made it through those dark days. (Ya know Schultz, we shoulda rioted!) ALTHOUGH we paid little attention then to Directors, Producers and so forth, we did notice that it was from Columbia, the Stooges Home Studio. We made no connection between the KWAI Project and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (Horizon Pictures/Columbia, 1962) which claimed most of the same production team, including director, Sir David Lean.ADDING to this disjointed view of their Cinematic Family Tree was the order in which the two were viewed; the latter film, LAWRENCE, was seen by our gang at the Highland Theatre, near 79th & Ashland Avenue, right here on Chicago's South Side, the 'baddest part of town.' This gave us a convoluted view of the two films time, not the period they were portraying, but rather of the real time of production and release.NOW THEN, after many years of experience and 'wisdom building', we can state with a great deal of certainty that we can see the relationship of the two, make note of certain similarities in directorial style and overall impact.ALTHOUGH the settings of the two are similar, in that both tell their stories of Warfare in Asia; one (BRIDGE) is a story of a World War II incident (based in fact) set in the Equatorial Rain Forests of Thailand; the other (LAWENCE) being a World War I Biopic taking place in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. The modern countries involved would be Syria, Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.IT is obvious that Sir David is fond of War themes that are meticulously rendered and tendered to the screen in a matter-of-fact manner. Lean gives no simplistic characterizations of these World Conflicts and takes no sophomoric stands against the actions taken by the Soldier in the field; those being represented by the Pawn on the Chess board.David LEAN has shown a propensity for working with certain actors in his products; a tendency shared with names such as: Hitchcock, Ford, Capra and many others. Shared and admired talents seem to be a good recipe for success. But there is one screen personality that gets no credits in the cast; yet appears to be one of those that David uses again and again with great success. That would be the great outdoors.WHILE concentrating the action of the story in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is centered on the interaction, conflict, alliance and eventual mutual respect of Japanese Colonel Saito, Commandant of the Prisoner of War Forced Labor Camp (Mr. Sessile Hayakawa) with the Ranking Allied P.O.W., the British Colonel Nicholson (Sir Alec Guinness). The dynamics of the groups, both Captors and Captives, are determined by the conduct and integrity displayed by their respective Cox's. (That's 'Commanding Officers' to you, Schultz) THE COLLISION of not only personalities, but also that of Cultures, provides the motivational engine that moves the story along at a seemingly short 161 minutes running time. We are witness to the Hard Liner Saito and the Proper & BY-the-Book Nicholson being locked in a stalemate of both will and style; with the edge going to Nicholson; Saito being at the disadvantage of needing the aid and cooperation of the Brits in doing his assigned task of completing the construction of the Bridge within a certain period. As Saito explains to Nicholson, he (the Japanese Officer) would be expected to take his own life if he weren't successful.THE SITUATIONS and their resulting outcomes are fine examples of two widely divergent psychological principalities; the first being that of 'Saving Face', the other called 'The Stockholm Syndrome.' IN THE FIRST case, Colonel Saito has taken extreme measures in order to convince ranking Allied Officer, Colonel Nicholson to allow his officers to perform manual labor, in violation of the Articles of the Geneva Convention. After a lengthy stay in the metal 'Sweat BOX', the British Officer is taken to the Commandant's hut and told that '.in honor of our (The Japanese) anniversary of victory in Asia, we will not require your officers to perform labor.' This is a perfect example of 'Saving Face' on Saito's part.SECONDLY, the very intense Colonel Nicholson gets so caught up in constructing a fine bridge, that he loses sight of the reality of which side he is on and finds himself working against the demolition of the wooden structure by Allied Forces; being Jack Hawkins, William Holden and four Thai Women Guides! (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) This is classic 'Stockholm Syndrome'.DIRECTOR LEAN is not above reusing a plot gimmick. Much in the same manner that Michael Curtiz reprised the gimmick of having contending groups singing opposing songs as in DODGE CITY (Warner Brothers,1939) with 'Marching Through Georgia' vs. 'Dixie', to CASABLANCA (Warners, 1942) pitting 'Watch On The Rhine' (German) vs. 'Les Marseilles' (French). Sir David uses not song, but rather in the use of spontaneous outbreaks of mass cheering and congratulations by the enlisted men in both THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.(Four Stars)POODLE SCHNITZ!!",10,1,3,12 March 2009
Man on Fire," Circle of Life, Circle of Fear, Circle of Guilt.. (A Lot of Circles under our Eyes!)
","WE DON'T OFTEN give great ratings or high praise to films with stories of rogue or former CIA operatives, who find themselves now outside of both their former employer's favor and at odds with the civil authorities aka the Police). Here we make a notable exception.WHILE THE MOVIE does seem to move at a snail's pace for such a long time and many reels, we do discover that this is all a necessary process to set the stage for what is to come later. And that later means some break-neck, but ever so well paced action.THE STORY CONCERNS the now mundane life of former agent John Creasy; who now has settled into a position as a bodyguard for a prominent, wealthy big wig family living in a city South of the Border. We see how the life is turning him into a reclusive alcoholic; destroying his very fiber of life.BUT THIS GUY, John Creasy (Mr. Denzel Washington), subscribes to the old proverb of: 'Any Job, big or small, is wort doing well or not at all!' He takes his daily escorts of the young daughter to and fro Parochial School. When she is kidnapped in an elaborate scheme and right from under his own nose, he responds appropriately. His training and years of experience all kick in and rescuing her is the only thing he lives for.THE STORYLINE DOES a great job of walking the tightrope between escapist action and maintaining a high level of realism. It is this connection with the realm of the real world which makes for the best of any sort of action oriented film.GIVE IT A TRY, soon and periodically after wards. Schultz and I both plan to do so!",10,1,2,28 December 2014
Jaws," No Schills in the Audience, No subliminal messages, Just Great Film-making, Superb Editing, Haunting Music, Excellent Acting and This One Will Scare You!!
","The fascination with fright on the Motion Picture Screen has been just about as popular a type of Fare as any-be they Romance, Swashbuckler, Historical Drama, Adventure, Crime, Comedy, Melodrama, Farce or the Biopic even. There seems to a certain attraction of movie goers' fantasies that draws them into identification with whatever Character is 'the Baddest.' Just how many boys would rather play 'Don del Oro', Al Capone or Darth Vader; than they would Zorro, Elliot Ness or Obi Won Kenobi?As for Scary Cinema, there are several definite, distinct classifications. First of there are the Horror and the Science Fiction divisions, but of course there are a lot that have characteristics of more than one. Those we may call 'hybrids' to borrow a term from Biology Lab.But no matter which way we look at it, JAWS (1975) is a 'Monster Movie', for even though a Shark is not a Mythological Creature, nor the product of somebody's fertile imagination, it is still monstrous to we puny humans.We'd read an old reviewer's write up of one of Charlie Chaplin's Comic 2 Reel Shorts. We can't remember which one, but in the course of the review the author said something like, '.the Movie Ushers really liked this film, and the Ushers see the Films almost as much as the Cops!' We guess that some things just never change.When this film was released, I was in the midst of my 35 year run as a Chicago Policeman. In addition, employment working Security for ABC-Great States' UNITED ARTISTS Theatre. When JAWS was booked in, we soon had Cops working there from opening till the last showing of the day was over. Previously, we would have 1 guy there on weekday evenings, 2 on Weekends.Well, after a couple o' days, we went to 'Plan B'. That called for 2 men, coast to coast, all the way. The crowds justified such a change of staffing and necessitated bring in more 'urban mercenaries, more hired guns! You know, Schultz, more Off-Duty Cops! I mean the earliest show at around 9:00 A.M, would be packed!There was good reason for these crowds' seeming magical materialization. JAWS. You see, was a very good film. It was thrilling, dramatic, humorous, literate and it scared the living Hell right of you. All the elements seemed to be there in proper proportions. The balance achieved by Director Steven Spielberg, Novelist Peter Benchley and Screen Writer Carl Gottlieb, seemed to be near perfection. The movie goers were all seen leaving, were both laughing and crying simultaneously (and at the same time, too!). But whatever the case was in any particular instance, people were all talking about their collective and individual cinematic experiences of the previous 2 hours or so, and all of this unsolicited feedback was Positive, Very Positive.The key operative word here is 'mood'. JAWS truly benefited from a beautiful, haunting and even biosynchronous Original Musical Score from the Maestro (Himself), John Williams. From the very opening, shown from the point of view of the Shark, the subtle irising in on the swimming area, contrasted with the merrymaking on the beach by some of those Teen Agers!! Taking cue from the musical score, I swear our hearts began to beat much more quickly, and our whole nervous system joined in. The various 'scary' scenes were done so well, that it did accomplish that need for 'Suspension of Disbelief and every Man, Woman, Boy, Girl and Pet who was in the audience shared in the fright and eventual fit of 'relief laughter' that followed.The Production Team seems to have struck a really good balance or blend of just the right balance of all those above mentioned elements as to make for a 'real scary picher' for all age groups, even the 'Big Kids'.Highly Recommended!",10,1,3,30 September 2007
The Wrestler," Grappling With The Truth.....................
","THERE'S NO DOUBT in our mind that the Writer, Director, Cast and the rest of the Production Team had the best of intentions in putting this one together. With the Pro Wrestling game being the hybrid sports/entertainment creature that it is and has been, it is a subject that interests people of a great cross section of society. Be they Doctors or Dock Workers, Stock Brokers or Stock Yardmen, or whatever the walk of life; there's interest in in 'Rasslin!' AND THE FILM does make the point that this is a game of big egos, chiseling promoters and a loyal, yet fickle following. All of these attributes may well apply to life in general; ergo, Wrestling's mass appeal.THE PORTRAYAL OF our protagonist, Randy 'the Ram' Robinson does ring true in several respects. First, as we intimated earlier, the big ego-he has it. Secondly, he has a strong desire to get back in the game-in spite of medical condition and he has a need to perform; he'll do so at even a diminished level for a much smaller purse ($$$).WHILE THE PRODUCTION team nails these certain elements of the Pro Game, in others they are obviously have not been an insider; such as this writer was. Case in point: while there is a great camaraderie among Pro Gtapplers, you'd never see them 'High Fiving' each other the way it is portrayed. But, you'll have to take our word for that one; because we won't tell you! AND IN SPITE of a Wrestler's outward appearance, which may vary from being fit & fabulous to fat & fastidious.

Stalag 17," Bringing Home a Message about those 'Out of the Game' and on 'The Sidelines' in the Cold, Wet and Muddy Hell Holes operated by the Axis Gang in 'Fortress Europa', 1944.
","Just about 8 years exactly since the last visages of World War II in VE Day and VJ Day were Front Page News, the Movie Version of our Movie made its premiere. STALAG 17 (Paramount, 1953) followed the original Broadway Stage Production of May 1951-June 1952 and 472 live performances. The play's Director, old 'Cyrano de Bergerac', Himself, Jose Ferrer, won a Tony for his efforts.But once the arrangements were made for adaptation to the still Silver Screen (the Movie Version was filmed in 'Glorious Black & White!'); the Directorial Duties would cede to one Samuel 'Billy' Wilder. Mr. Wilder had all of the necessary skills and balance of the serious, the tragic, the humorous and the ridiculous to pull off the Seri-Comic qualities which are inextricably blended and intermingled in the Play; be it on Stage or Screen.WE notice that there are only 2 carry-overs in roles from the Stage to the Screen. Those two being Harvey Lembeck (Harry Shapiro) and Robert Strauss (called 'Stosh' on Stage, but Stanislaus Kasava or 'Animal' in the film. Same Character as 'Stosh' or more properly, 'Stash' is nickname for Stanislaus.), were the only two to make the cut.OUR STORY.It's 1944, somewhere in Germany in a P.O.W. Camp barracks of Stalag 17. The camp is filled with Non-Coms*, being those paragons of intermediate authority, Sergeants. The camp's particular barracks has a problem for which that the inmates must find a solution. There is a one among them that no one wants; being a traitor, an informant a Kraut Spy! Aloof, cool and very business like, Sgt. Frank Sefton (William Holden) is Suspect 'Numero Uno'. Sefton, it seems, has no interest in anything else but himself and his sundry money making enterprises. His only confidant is Cookie (Gil Stratton) who runs some of his games (Rat Races, things like that!) and keeps his 'Books'.The inmates deal daily with one German Sgt. Schultz (Sig Ruman) who seems very benevolent, but underneath this façade, he is a loyal German Soldier and true Nazi. On occasion, the prisoners have the experience of being addressed directly by the Camp Commandant, Colonel von Scheurbach (Otto Preminger, making a rare on camera appearance). The Colonel is a bitter former Cavalry Officer, who now, being relegated to this definitely below-his-dignity job. This is, by the way, a truly outstanding characterization by Mr. Preminger, quite possibly being done as a favor to Mr. Wilder.All's well in the end as the real informant is discovered and dealt with as Sefton splits the scene, taking the Socially Prominent and Wealthy (in Civilian Life), Lieutenant Dunbar, out with him. THE END. (We tried not to give away too much, right Schultz?) STALAG 17 has a tremendous cast, and other than the appearance of some 'Russian Women' prisoners, it's an all male cast. And what an outstanding line-up it is! Other than the previously mentioned William Holden, Harvey Lembeck, Robert Strauss, Otto Preminger and Sig Ruman; we have an 'Army' of others. With all shining in their parts, we must salute: Richard Erdman, Peter Graves, Neville Brand (one of the top decorated Soldiers in the 'real' War!), Michael Moore (not the same guy, obviously), Peter Baldwin, Robinson Stone, Robert Shawley, William Pierson, Jay Lawrence, Erwin Kaiser, Edmund Trzcinski, et al! Peter Graves once said in an interview that being in this picture should have been a real boost for his career. But going to the movies was in decline in the 1950's; so Mr. Graves joined his real life bro, James Arness (GUNSMOKE) in Television, as Mr. Jim on 'FURY'.STALAG 17, of course, was the inspiration for its own take-off, 'HOGAN'S HEROES' (Bing Crosby Productions/CBS TV, 1965-71); but that's another story!

The Blind Side," First there was ROCKY, then we had RUDY, now we draw inspiration and 'enjoyment of Film at its finest in 2009's THE BLIND SIDE!
","OKAY, WE HEAR you! ROCKY was a fictional character in a make believe story about imaginary events, bouts and Boxers. In this we heartily concur; but with this one caveat. While ROCKY Star Sly Stallone's screen play is a work conjured up the characters and events from an obviously deep and fertile imagination. The work reflected a keen intellect; far from being that of a real life Rocky Balboa.IN SHORT, we hold that there is real life inspiration here; that being to a 1975 Heavyweight Bout between Champ Mohamed Ali with an unranked and lesser-known non-contender in Chuck Wepner. There were many elements in the real life fight that were replicated in the ROCKY storyline; including the Challanger knocking the Champ off his feet, the fight's going the full distance of 15 Rounds, the Bigger Than Life Personality of both Ali and 'Appollo Creed', etc.AS FOR OUR second compare-a-movie subject, we all know that RUDY is based on the real life story of one Andrew 'Rudy' Ruettiger, the kid who wanted more than anything to grow up and to play Football for the University of Notre Dame; eventually doing that thing in spite of being '5 feet nothing', 100 nothing' pounds', etc.ALTHOUGH THE TWO films both involve the stories of young boys growing up to be apart of Major College Football programs, that's where the similarities between RUDY and today's sacrificial offering,THE BLIND SIDE, end.WE MUST CONFESS to having a large dose of ignorance operating in our household; being at least in the knowledge of the 'Man of the House'(Me!). The 'Little Woman' (my long-suffering Wife, Deanna) suggested that the two of us sneak off early last Saturday for a 'Matinee'. (Now Schultz, we mean at the nearby Quarry 14 Multiplex in Hodgkins, not any sort of 'Romantic' getaway!) VERY MUCH TO my surprise, the film was very, very good-on all fronts. It has a great and true story, told in a most enjoyable manner. The casting was excellent with young Quinton Aaron turning in a masterful performance as the abused and neglected young Michael Oher. He at once gave us a main character who was intelligent & deep, yet isolated, under taught, emotionally scarred, lonely and affection starved. He also is discovered to have a great deal of untapped potential in scholastics as well as some obvious potential in athletics. (Can you say Football & Basketball? Can you, Schultz?) AS HIS ADOPTED family, Tim McGraw does an excellent job of the bread winner (Sean Tuohy) who has the means to financially take on the responsibility of another 'family' member, without there being an immediate strain on the old budget. Mr. Tuohy, you see, owns a string of drive-in fast food restaurants; as it is explained in the movie.AS FOR THE performance of Miss Sandra Bullock as the Mrs., Leigh Anne Tuohy, we believe that she brought a lot of depth and understanding to the role; being a part that really gave her a chance to show off some very skilled Thespian-type skills! So much of the story turns on the realizations and subsequent actions taken by the one in the role of Mother. The scene where the Tuohy Family encounters 'Big Mike' alone, cold and hungry on a rainy evening in Autumn, is powerfully and realistically rendered. It was truly pivotal to the story. It is at this point where they ponder if their adhering to a Christian way of life was just a matter of words or would they take a real life stance and make their actions speak for them.ALTHOUGH WHAT WE see is a movie, the story that unfolded to us should make us aware that we all can do even a small act of Chrustian love and kindness toward those in need; not necessarily as great and complex an effort as did the Tuohy Family. Who knows how much human talent and abilities are wasting right now. That's ability and talent that would make the world just a little better place.AND IN CLOSING, let us try to remember a quote from the Good Book, that goes something like:'What so ever you do for the Least of My Brethern, you do for me!'WHAT'S OUR RECOMMENDATION? Well, see it and buy the DVD when it comes out! It's bound to be an Oscar Nominee, at least!",10,3,10,6 December 2009
Iron Man," Highest Example of Making a Great Picture and a Faithful Comics Adaptation in one Movie! See it before it's relegated to Videoland and the DVD Forever!
","AH! A Movie Comic Book adaptation; it's one of my favourite desserts! Being both a film buff and an old Comic Book guy, dating from the olden days of 1957, this is just a perfect sort of a review for this kid. They can be so much fun; yet, such a pain in the ass!THE latter attribute above is due mainly to the tendency of the screen writing and directorial fraternities in monkeying around with characters, identities and (so often) origins. I suppose that you could call me a sort of purist, in that sense; perhaps even a 'Comicological Conservative' of sorts. Guilty, Guilty is my plea to that charge! SO, what's my penalty, the sentence already?TAMPERING with successful Comic Strips and Comic Books (remember, they're not exactly the same thing!) has long been a standing tradition in Hollywood; along with the same treatment applied to the Comic Strips/Books close relatives, the Pulp Magazine and Radio Series Adventure Characters. We suppose that this may be some way of justifying the writers' and directors' jobs and their oft outrageous $allarie$. HENCE, we saw so many glaringly erroneous examples of false adaptational zeal; that indeed seemed to have been the rule, rather than the exception. The addition of characters as well as settings and names all were deemed to be fair game.EXAMPLES abound in the Sound Serial Adaptations; such as: in DICK TRACY (Republic, 1937), the first of 4 Tracy Chapterplays, Detective Tracy's main squeeze is names Gwenn; whereas we all know that it was Tess Trueheart from day one in Chester Gould's Comic Strip. For FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (Universal, 1938), the venue was transformed to the Red Planet from the original setting in adapting the Sunday Comic Strip continuity 'The Witch Queen of Mongo', featuring Queen Azura.EVEN the best of the Comic Book Hero Serials were guilty of unnecessary variant scenarios. As case in point, we present THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL (Republic, 1941); which transplanted the Comic Book Origin from a deep, dark old subway tunnel to meting the Wizard, SHAZAM, in a Tomb in a remote part of Siam (which looked suspiciously like L.A.'s Griffith Park). SPY SMASHER (Republic, 1942) gave the main character & Spy Smasher's alter-ego, Alan Armstrong, a twin brother, Jack! (Get it, Schultz, Jack Armstrong!). But these elements were easily overlooked. Because of the fine adherence to the rest of the story lines and the rendering of action and special effects; even the strictest of constructionists (like yours truly)could both forgive and overlook.'CAMP' Humor that was injected into the BATMAN Television Series (Greenway/20th Century-Fox/ABC TV, 1966-1968) did not do as much harm; as the heart of the Batman feature was intact, the Villains were right from Comics Pages and even the best episodes were adapted right from the stories in Detective Comics and Batman Comics Magazine.AS for our brand spankin' new IRON MAN (Dark Blade/Fairview/Road Rebel/Marvel/Paramount, 2008) accomplishes much on its own; while maintaining the original elements of Origin and the general tone of the Iron Man feature. There was no attempt to improve on the original. And yet, the feature is now over 40 years old; ergo, there would have to be some certain degree of adaptation, if only to make connection with our world of today.IN updating the international situation of then as opposed to now, we find that the new production was wise enough to infuse the elements of the War Against the Islamic Fascist Terrorists; as that is surely the problem we face today. During Iron Man's original run, Mr. Stan Lee would most often use phrases such as '.So, Red Star, You are just another Slave to Your Kremlin Masters!' .in addressing the Enemy. The villains were tailor made to the Cold War; such as the Red Chinese super operative, as well as Road Show Fu Manchu, The Mandarin.DIRECTOR John Favreau, who has displayed such diversity in working before and behind the camera, had the good sense to strike a fine balance between the serious and the escapist; the action scenes being punctuated by the use of great humour and fine comic relief, which hits the old funny bone of the juvenile viewer as well as the older, more sophisticated SEX AND THE CITY female set. Our favourite exponent of the smart, modern, even 'hip' humour is the super loyal (and loving) secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Her explanation of her duties to the young female reporter, recently bedded by Mr. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) being 'Sometimes I have to throw out the trash!' THE villainy other than that of the Islamist Fascist Terrorists and Insurgents is provided by one of our favourite players. Jeff Bridges provides the dangerous opponent of the enemy within. As Obediah Stane/The Iron Monger, he serves up a double dose of treachery; both with unfathomable greed in the Corporate Board Room and in the Middle Eastern Theatre of War, as a sort of 5th Column Collaborator.LET'S see, what else? Oh, yeah the original musical score by Ramin Djawadi is excellent in both the overture (theme) and the incidental music (mood & action queues). It is apparent that a lot of thought was given to the original composition as it is truly fashioned to order for the Iron Man Saga. Obviously Jon Favreau had familiarity with the character from reading the 'Jokebooks' as a kid and teen.AS for the Special Effects, what can we say? They are outstanding and speak for themselves. Their movement and the way they seamlessly are blended into the proceedings are as fine as those of any, even those of SPIDERMAN II and III. Man, those Special Flying FX sure have come a long way from Tom Tyler's CAPTAIN MARVEL or Kirk Allyn's SUPERMAN and ATOM MAN VS. SUPERMAN (both Columbia, 1948 and 1950 respectively).POODLE SCHNITZ!!",9,1,3,10 July 2008
Unbroken," Testing of the American Spirit to the Nth Degree.
","IT WOULD APPEAR to be an incontrovertible fact that better stories that are based in historical fact are made when there has been a little distance of time between the actual occurrences and the presentation on the screen. Our review today of being a prime example of this assertion.THE SCREENPLAY MAKES excellent, if somewhat limited, use of flashbacks as th film opens up with a bombing raid with a young crew of Airmen of the U.S. Army Air Corps. It quickly time-travels back to the early life of a young son of Italian immigrant parents; who shows plenty of anti-social and even criminal behaviour. The love and discipline of his Mother & Father, along with some good coaching from his older brother, nudge the boy's energies into Track & Field Athletics. His training leads to his berth on the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and to Gold Medal victory.THE ADVENT OF War in both Europe and the Pacific Rim interrupt the boy's further career in Running and we learn how his lessons learned as a kid come to full fruition in the Pacific Theatre of War. Strong sense of tenacity and the will to live prove to be the most powerful weapons against the tyranny and unbelievable inhumanity to man of the Axis Powers.THERE ARE SOME who insist that the movie's subject matter was purposely brought out at this time as a reference to our own CIA's alleged 'torture' of terrorist enemies ever since the events of 9/11/2001. We couldn't disagree more with this accusation and with its promoters. Please, read on.THE FILM ACCURATELY makes an accurate of the conditions under which Allied POW's lived under the prisoner camp system of Imperial Japan. In sharp contrast, we personally know of Axis captured soldiers being held in Michigan; where they were employed in helping with the harvesting of the crop of fruit trees, such as apples. For this they were paid and many Germans and Italians later emigrated to the USA and the Michigan Apple Orchards.THIS IS INDEED a story which needed to be told, and soon as Father Time is rapidly calling to our World War II Vets, with main character, Louis Zamperini's having passed away earlier this year. This is documented at film's end in a review of what happened in the real world since then.WE CAN'T GIVE this a high enough mark.",10,12,29,28 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," If the Big Boys won't let You play, just take Your Ball and Start Your Own Game! George Lucas did and Look What Happened!
","As Hollywood Legend goes, young Producer-Director George Lucas had sought to obtain the Screen Rights from the Hearst Corporation's King Features Syndicate to do a new Film version of their FLASH GORDON Comic Strip. The Classic Space Adventure Strip had been created by Comic Art Master, Alex Raymond (1909-56) and debuted January 7, 1934.The Comic Strip was a magnificent combination of Science Fiction and Sword, Sandal and Sorcery. In spite of having misgivings about Universal Pictures turning FLASH into a Movie Serial in 1936, Buster Crabbe, the Olympic Swimming Champion, found himself loaned out from his own Studio, Paramount Pictures Corporation, and cast in the lead. It was an overwhelming success and FLASH GORDON (Universal Pictures, 1936) merited 2 subsequent sequels: FLASH GORDON'S TRIP TO MARS (Universal, 1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE (Universal, 1940); both Sequels had Mr. Crabbe in the Starring/Title Roles.BUT, back to the 1970's where we find our little chum, George Lucas age 30ish, waiting patiently for an answer from King Features; hopefully a Positive answer, but any would do, just to get an answer one way or another. Finally an answer did come. 'No' was its short and sweet message.KNOWING that rejection is a large part of this, this Show Biz and one could not hope for success by sitting around, pouting, lolly-gagging and otherwise wasting precious time; Mr. Lucas took his Ball Home (it was after all, his BALL) and found himself another game.SO before long, an entire new Universe of New Characters and History emerged as we learned all bout Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Obi-Won Kenobi, Darth Vader, Chewbacca and the struggles between the Old Republic and the Totalitarian Oriented Empire Lucas' own 'Flash Gordon' was born, fully fledged and in the middle of on of those famed Stellar Conflicts.STAR WARS (Lucas Films, Ltd./20th Century-Fox, 1977) was of course the answer and final by-product. And although there is obviously influence from previously mounted Space Operas, this Film and the ultimate 5 prequels/sequels really stood up as an original saga, unique unto itself with no other saga.To begin with, the entire concept and story belonged to George Lucas. It was a true Lucas Film in every sense. He built favourite baby using the finest of ingredients available. The cast, for example is a sterling example of what we're speaking of.We have Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammill) as the mystified young orphaned kid, raised by Aunt Beru (Shalagh Fraser) and Uncle Owen (Phil Brown). Their whole lives are radically altered when they receive a message via the Robot R2D2 (Kenny Baker) from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).THROWN into the thrall are Ben (Obi Won) Kenobi (Alec Guiness, a Stout, virtuoso Actor) Robot C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), a Free Lancing Space Soldier of Fortune & Sort of Swashbuckler, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Alien 'Wooki' sidekick, Chewbacca (Peter Mahew).PROVIDING the disloyal and murderous opposition we have Darth Vader (Davis Prowse = physical part, James Earl Jones = vocals), the former Jedi Knight turned Evil and the Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) who represent every smile to your face-back-stabbing wuss of a Boss that we've all met at on tine or another. At their beck and call are minions of the Empire's Storm Troopers, Bomber and Fighter Pilots and all who work on the infamous Death Star, the super combination space vessel and self contained planetoid of destruction; almost being to the average space ship as a Carrier is to a Destroyer or P.T. Boat.WITH the counter balance between the white clad Obi Won Kenobi and the all Dark Armor and Black Cape, Lucas has given us a clear contrast.. With the many references to 'the Force' and 'May the Force be with you!', Mr. Lucas is clearly placing morality squarely in the middle of this otherwise seemingly 'bubble gum' Space Opera.IN Ben Kenobi (Obi Won), we are clearly presented with Good. In Darth Vader the opposite is represented, Evil.WITH the term 'The Force' Mr. Lucas is doing just one thing. He is giving standing and recognition to someone who probably is known to all; yet perhaps most of us probably don't give him his due. George Lucas obviously recognized this and decided to do something about it; even though in doing so definitely would fly in the face of that Politically Correct Crowd.IN the prominent placement of 'The Force' as a central theme and motivator of this and all the other entries, he in a sense reintroduced us all to GOD.Thank you, George and May the Force be with You!

Sin City," To paraphrase what President Woodrow Wilson called World War I, This is the 'NOIR TO END ALL NOIRS', ain't it, Schultz?
","BEING part of the Post War Baby Boom, having been born into a Blue Collar Working Class family; it was only natural that Comic Books would be a staple on the monthly reading & entertainment menus. Starting at some date in 1952, we started getting TREASURE CHEST at St. Theodore Elementary School. Designed for Catholic School kids and it carried stories of Saints, Historical Incidents and a Serialized Adventure Strip about a real cool,kind of a coach & mentor. The title was 'Chuck White' and it kept us coming back for more month after month, at least during the seemingly never-ending school year.OLDER Sister, Joanne Ryan (1942-90) was a 5th Grader at this time; she from time to time brought home a copy of ARCHIE Comics or some such similar publication. We preferred the likes of DENNIS THE MENACE, LITTLE LULU, BUGS BUNNY and just about anything that was had a WALT Disney theme.THEN it happened. After the passing of several years, at about 10 ½ years, the then declining Super Hero/Costumed Crime Fighter genre struck us. It was the Summer of 1957; the same year that the Ruskies launched their Sputnik, Joanne's younger brother (me!) tried out for the Little League and Gramma Fuerst (our Mother's Mother) died at 77 years of age; as did our Uncle Ed Ryan (Dad's younger brother) at 39.ADDITIONALLY to these milestones, another occurrence collided with my young and relatively uneventful life in the house on South Damen Avenue. Although it is an admittedly happening of much lesser importance, it nonetheless seemed to mark me for life. Our gang discovered guys like SUPERMAN, BATMAN, THE FLY, THE JAGUAR and THE PHANTOM in the Comic Books that were always available at Cal & Eleanor's Damen Drug Store;which was right there at the corner of 65th & Damen Avenue. Of all those available characters, there was one who absolutely captured my imagination. Guess who he was? GIVE UP, do you? Okay Schultz, it was BATMAN. AFTER reading and really getting into these stories, this writer literally wanted to be Batman; so much so as the super hero was the theme of our costumes that Halloween, with yours truly donning the blue serrated edged cape, bat-eared cowl, gray pajamas and blue boots, trunks & gloves of the Batman. Mind you that this was nearly a decade before the great Camp Batman Craze on ABC TV.IN THE ensuing years ever since there have been heap lot of changes and developments in the Comics Magazine Publishing field. There came specialty shops that sold only comic books and related materials. These Comic Shops handled a plethora of titles; a seemingly galactic number of titles. They also had certain age ranges targeted, with traditional kiddy publications and running up to some strictly ''Adults Only' stuff. These so called 'more sophisticated' stuff gave rise to a new sub-species, the Graphic Novel.TODAY'S reviewed movie, SIN CITY (Troubleshooter Studios/Dimension Films. 2005) is the adaptation of one of these 'growed up Joke Books.BEING the brain-child of Comics writer & artist, Frank Miller, the adaptation and (shared) directorial duties fell to the stories creator. This means that it have received a fairly close of a rendering as its screen play and characterizations. At this we can only guess or surmise about its veracity by what we hear from others; as we are not at all familiar with the Graphic Novels about (Ba)Sin City.IN having screened it at the LaGrange (Illinois) Theatre's $2.00 special showings, we do feel competent in giving testimony of our opinion in that film's behalf. As far as a its being a truly different sort of movie from a technical point of view; it sure fits the bill there. Other than SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF Tomorrow (consortium of companies/Paramount, 2004) and Mr. Frank Miller's recent adaptation of Will Eisner's THE SPIRIT (Continental/Odd Lot/Lionsgate, 2008) we can't think of any example of this technique of marry animation art with live action.THIS use of the widely disparate processes makes for some truly spectacular scenes and creates a whole array of other possibilities for future projects. Certainly genres of film as widely diverse as Science Fiction, Historical, Biblical, Super Hero or whatever would benefit from the spectacular scenery and 'sets' that could be made.AS FOR our rundown and lowdown on SIN CITY, we have to give a heavy hearted report of a mixed review. Whereas the images and characters were both fascinating & very interesting, and the action sequences were neatly done and not really overdone, which could have been a real temptation to do; the action, the plot lines and the surroundings left us sort of in a negative state of being.COMPLICATING matters even more was that accompanying this writer to the Movie Show on that evening was Mrs. Ryan (Deanna), who had even less familiarity with the subject matter than did meself (with all of my experience in comics). Well what can we say; except something that reasonably approaches the truth, and nothing but.IN CONCLUSION, Ladies & Gentlemen of the Jury, we can enjoy and appreciate pretty much any story, however off-beat, in whatever medium from strict prose, graphic sequential art, spoken word or as a play-be it legitimate theatre or filmed. However, we don't have the ability to get into the spirit of the language & interaction between characters in the story. 'With a body like that, she could get any guy she wanted; if she wasn't a lesbian' exclaims 'Bob' (Michael Madsen).BETWEEN passages like that and action such as having one guy beating his opponent in one of those filthy, scummy gas station-like bathrooms and pushing the opponents head into the dirty toilet bowl, replete with whirling fecal matter as it was flushed; well, you get what we're driving at, no?",8,1,3,26 February 2009
Gangs of New York," Recreating a Slice of Time; Educating, Edifying and Enchanting its audience, all at the Same Time!
","SPANNING the length of the entire from the very first frame of film right up to the very end, GANGS OF NEW YORK (Initial Entertainment Group/Miramax Films, 2002) bursts onto the screen like a an exploding super nova in the heavens; continuing to apply its vice-like grip to its audience up to the very end. It is a most unusual film, unique beyond belief. It qualifies as a truly singular work of cinematic art; standing alone with none other quite like it.TO begin with, the meticulous manner in which the sets replicating New York City's Five Points Neighborhood of the late 1840's to the early Civil War 1860's, immediately transports its viewers to this other place in those days long gone. Unlike most other movies viewed, there is none of the ever present, underlying feel of the knowledge that it is all make believe.CAREFULLY casting the main players, Director Martin Scorsese brings a much larger principal cast than usual. Featured players are divided between those with name recognition (Star Power-if you will), and those 'faces' that make their mark by giving memorable performances in their portrayals of characters passing through the story.HEADLINING the superb cast are such luminaries as Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz and Liam Neeson; being joined by such capable performers as John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Cara Seymour, Stephen Graham and Gary Lewis.MIXING all of this on screen talent with some of the most spectacularly unique and starkly realistic and other worldly sets ever; Director, Mr. Martin Scorsese gave us what one could only describe as a bit of American History that had come alive on the screen.WE, of course realize that film is not reality and seldom captures real historical happenings. GANGS OF NEW YORK is, alas, a screen play; a make believe story which has been concocted to give its audience a well spent couple of hours.INASMUCH as it has been said that there is no such thing as strict fiction, we know that real influences from real living people. In the case of this GANGS saga, it is also one of those movies that fall into the category of an Historical Picture; being the cinematic equivalent of the Historical Novel.HISTORICALLY speaking, Mr. Scorsese's film served us very well on multiple fronts.FIRST of all, it brought to vivid, life-like on screen realism to the City of New York in the late 1840's through the period of our American Civil War. In order to do so, sets replicating the slums of Five Points and other locations in old New York were constructed in that Italian Movie Studio. THESE sets were extremely impressive and came with such a price tag, that it has been said that we won't be seeing their likes again; opting for computer generated sets, scenery and backgrounds would prove to be much more of a frugal approach to the creation of spectacular scenes. Our case in point is the Russell Crowe starring vehicle, THE GLADIATOR (DreamWorks/Scott Free/Universal Pictures, 2000), which made use of some spectacular, computer generated imagery.SECONDLY, the story brought to light a period in our own American History that appears to have little representation in our popular fiction. It was a time of a Native American Political Party, also known by the common moniker of 'The Know Nothing Party.' The 'Know Nothings' had a very simple and uncomplicated, straight forward sort of manifesto. They hated all things immigrant, legal or not. At this time, it was legal immigration that was streaming in from Ireland and the German States and Principalities. THIS should serve as a good example to all that the people on the bottom rung of the American ladder were not always non-whites; but rather two European, Caucasian Ethnicities, who incidentally now are the two most numerous groups to which Americans trace their descent.THIRDLY, little is said in most of our Primary and Secondary School's History Books about the New York Draft Riots, which were so vividly and graphically portrayed here. Certainly the total chaos of the riots and the pointless and pitiful death and destruction of property that ensued is at once both disturbing and enlightening in portrayal.THERE is a particularly intense concentration on the wanton and senseless violence and destruction that is invariably the product of the Mob Mentality. There was one sterling example of the product of such anarchical behaviour. In those riot sequences, the White Immigrant rioters start to attack any and all of the Free Blacks, who they encounter in their destructive, malicious sweep across Manhattan Island; even hanging one of the young Black Guys who was earlier shown to be a member of one of the White Five Points Gangs.AS a final shock to the viewing audiences was the depiction of the U.S. Naval vessels in their desperate use of cannon fire to bombard rioters. This is a most disturbing sequence in the film; made ever so much more alarming by the cold realization that it was factual.IN our humble opinion, we believe that Martin Scorsese deserved some more consideration for Oscar with this Film. Although it probably did not do the great traffic at the Box Office that the Studio would have liked, it did much better than an also ran. We believe that time will be very kind to this GANGS OF NEW YORK; declaring it to be in a class with the top films of all time. It is a one of a kind, unique work of Cinematic Art; not unlike CITIZEN KANE, CASABLANCA, THE THIRD MAN and Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, even!

The talent of Mr. Scorsese and his life proximity to the Earthy atmosphere of the Gangster Film make for a double-barrel dose of the what is both familiar and yet strange to us all. The unique niche in the annals of film genres that is occupied by the Gangster Movie is truly a study in one end of the spectrum meeting the other end somewhere in the middle.The Gangster film seems to be one Film Genre that everyone enjoys. Perhaps it is that there is a clue in the film, itself. At one point, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)in describing what it is to be a gangster says(in fine voice-over form), '...we were like Movie Stars with muscle!' That must be it, for I can well recall as a kid prefer being Al Capone to being Elliott Ness.In Director Scorsese's capable hand, we have the True Master. His is the mind to not only select a story for adaptation to the screen. The settings and the stories are great.(Being a native New Yorker, he knows this terrain, like no other.) But friend Martin has one secret weapon at his disposal that gave his work the final edge of so many others.Mr. Scorsese makes use of all sorts of seemingly commonplace techniques, combined and then given an even greater effectiveness by these combination of these. Hence, using the hand held camera with the subjective lens, then combining it with crisp, short bursts of voice over, is used to create a sense of here and now that is virtually unseen elsewhere..But this Director does not push it. He knows that he should just give us so much of this business, and then he abruptly switches gears. This is done several times during the course of the film and is particularly effective in getting out a lot of exposition material and advancing the story.Bringing a full three dimensional look and feel to the characters he presents to us is where an awful lot of other film makers are left behind in the dust. Any character in GOOD FELLAS is complex and multi-faceted. Plenty of time and care is expended in an effort to make each character into something besides being just another character. There is not any room for the shallow, the one sided, the 'stock' or stereo-typed in Martin Scorsese's World.So, we see a Henry, who would do a 'Hit', yet is caring and loving in personally protecting and comforting a frightened, molested Karen. Paulie who holds the powers of Judge and Exicutioner over so many low level syndicate 'soldiers' and 'wannabees', yet is gentle and protective to the multitude of his adoring nieces and nephews. Even Tommy, who is clearly 'not playing with a full deck' and could fly off the handle and kill for absolutely no reason, is still kind and respectful to his poor, old white haired Mother.Only Jimmy Conway(DeNiro)seems to be lacking in any real, even half-fast good points to his personality. In the final analysis, is it he who is the worst of the bad guys? What is it that he lacks to leave him so inadequate as a person? There is one other element that seems to permeate all of Master Builder Scorsese's finished products. Mr. Scorsese always has had the ability to bring his characters just one step beyond what we would expect. He has displayed the good judgment to make his characters identifiable with us, the movie going public. This he accomplishes by bridging any existing gaps between us and the on-screeners. No matter how different we are, he manages to bring a sense of identification to us.Hence, regardless of personal station in life (Low-life Gangster, Caveman-like Prize fighter or enigmatic billionaire tycoon) or any difference in ethnicity(Italian,Irish,Jewish, Black, etc.)we identify with these characters. I mean, I forget just how many people, who we know, said that they were reminded of someone from their own life experiences from Joe Pesci's characterization.",10,0,1,14 August 2007
Cinderella Man," Not Just a Boxing Picture
","When we were looking for a movie to see that particular evening a few months ago,my wife protested that Cinderella MAN was a boxing film and that it would be better suited for my brothers,buddies and myself. Well, we wound up going in anyway and, boy was she glad.While it's true that Cinderella MAN is a story of the prize ring, it is much more than that. It's a boxing story, a biography and a period piece as well as a love story of sorts.Now, that is not to say that the fisticuffs of the film were sub standard in any way. Both the demonstration of the 'Sweet Science' by the individual actors and the recreation of historical bouts from the depression era are all top notch. To start with it is based on the true story of one James J.Braddock who was a sort of Journeyman Light Heavyweight Boxer in the 1920's. Braddock had to give up his pugilistic career due to some recurring injury to his hand. Some time later, he gets back into the game and works his way up to the Heavyweight Crown. This is all common knowledge to most any sports fan.The film is also a great biopic in that it has been said to capture the essence of the real man. At times the character seems almost too good to be true. But those who knew him have insisted that the real man was as portrayed.As a 'Love Story', well love is all portrayed all throughout this story. We see the love and devotion of a man and woman to each other and to their family.The love of the children for their folks when the financial condition of the country and the whole world is at its very worst.And finally, the love of a public for a true champion for them to revere.Lastly, the film was a period piece. It paints a very good picture of the depression years and what it was (and still is) like to be among the working poor. Mr.Braddock was representative of that generation of people who bravely fought their way through the Great Depression, only to immediately face the dangers and come out victorous in World War II.",10,2,4,31 August 2005
From Here to Eternity," Watered Down and Diluted Version of 'Hot' Novel.
","BY THE YEAR of 1953, when this blockbuster hit the movie houses, we were able to step back and take a much more objective collective look at many of the happenings of World War II, and to the years immediately preceding it. Through the use of adult fiction in the form of the novel, we are given a multi-tiered presentation of, what many would consider, a much more innocent America.BEING SET IN the U.S. Territory of Hawaii, and more specifically, right at Pearl Harbor, our story follows the story of several widely divergent people; telling their various stories through some loosely connected events. The story is knit together only by the membership by those in the U.S. Army; which function as a sort of cohesive literary glue.STRICTLY SPEAKING, THIS film is not a War Movie; but rather a study of people coexisting and managing to live out their lives in the presence of and even in spite of some very difficult happenings. Surely, we would have to take into account the fact that this was an Amderica at the tail end of the Great Depression. The characters in the story would be hardened and already weary of life itself.IN RESPECT TO the times in which the movie was made, its style is highly representative of the early '50's; which in a small way, dates it. The manner with which many of the contradictory happenings are dealt with are much more subtly dealt with. There is no area more indicative of this than in the matter of S-E-X.THE PORTRAYAL OF Master Sergeant (Burt Lancaster) 'dating' his Commanding Officer's wife (Deborah Kerr) is done up rather casually and highly watered down from the print page counterpart in the novel. For Example; the two of them both just happen to have bathing suits on under their evening clothes; allowing for an on screen moonlight swim, but no skinny dipping here. This was the '50's and the censor wouldn't allow it! WITH REGARD TO the relationship between the Montgomery Clift character and Donna Reed's, she has been described as a 'Call Girl'. In the portrayal, she works at a 'hostess' at a 'club'. In reality, the establishment is a brothel and Miss Reed a prostitute.THERE IS SOMETHING to recommend this to all; even with old fashioned 'cleaned up' version that it is. Being contrasted with today's, 'anything goes', butt naked, explicit sex laden methods, we prefer some subtlety and use of the power of suggestion. After all, it requires some higher degree of brain power (thinking) and is suitable for younger viewers. We can testify to the veracity of this; as we (that is I) were a very innocent 7 year old when we saw it at the old Ogden Theater, kin Chicago, and it all went strictly TWA (over my head).BEFORE WE SIGN off, we must give proper praise and tribute to the performances by Ernest Borgnine and Frank Sinatra in rendering this as being a sort of 'Noir goes to War' offering.",10,5,5,22 May 2012
The Godfather," Dedicated to my good friend and partner, the late Patrolman Angelo Renardo (1935-86), Chicago Police Department, who loved the picture!
","MOTION PICTURES having organized crime as the subject matter seem to be forever 'IN' as fair game for a movie ('Film' if it's a special, 'Top-Shelf'production). In every era we have seen filmed stories of Gangland. Some have been factual(ST.VALENTINE'S MASSACRE), some 'loosely' based on factual material (AL CAPONE-Monogram 1959, THE UNTOUCHABLES-all incarnations) and then there are those that are all fictional(THE DON IS DEAD,THE LAST DON,DONDI).FINALLY we have a category which is fiction, but not strict fiction; being an original work which, while not being the representation of historical events, it contains fictional events that are inspired by real life occurrences.THIS is the type of storyline that makes for the best fiction; also this type is the one that makes and needs those disclaimers that appear in the either the opening or closing credits of a Feature Film or TV series episode that say something like: 'THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM/TV EPISODE ARE FICTICOUS. NO COMPARISON TO REAL PERSONS, LIVING OR DEAD ARE INTENDED NOR SHOULD BE INFERRED.' TODAY'S honored/dissected film, MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER(Alfan Productions/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1972), is perhaps the best example of an exponent of this category of Gangster Film. While we all are aware that the story is not a true one; at the same time we also note that there are many characters and occurrences in the story, both in the book and on the screen, that were clearly either suggested by real people and actual incidents or were out and out caricatures of such.READILY we can identify fictional characters in the story that were doubtless obvious make-believe versions of denizens from our real world. The main character of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) seems to be a composite character; having taken certain characteristics from both Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino, New York Underworld Big-Wigs both as well as Dons of two different 'Families'. Carlo Gambino even had been known as 'the Godfather'.ANY casual gambler or vacationer recognizes that the character of Moe Green, a Las Vegas Casino Operator closely corresponds to the profile of real-life Ben 'Bugsy' Siegel; who was both an early advocate and promoter of investing in and expanding the already existing gambling in 'Sin City'.(Ben Siegel was portrayed by Warren Beatty in BUGSY (Baltimore Pic./Mullholland Prod./Dessert Vision/Tri-Star, 1991, but that's another story!) QUITE POSSIBLY the most obvious connection between the factual actual and the all made-up fictional lies in that of the fictional singer. 'Johnny Fontaine' (real life singer Al Martino) has the most widely held opinion of naming 'old blue eyes'(himself), Frank Sinatra as being the leading suspect.THERE is indeed many similarities both in Mr. Martino's characterization, as well as the story's references to 'That Movie Big Shot' and Johnny Fontaine's not getting the part in the War Picture that he wanted.* But in the novel, the singer Fontaine has a Comedian Partner! Can you say Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis? Allen & Rossi? how about Brown & Carney, Wheeler & Woolsey, Clark & McCullough, Abott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy, Samson & Delilah, St. Paul & Minneapolis....ON a personal note; the reported indignation expressed by some Italian-American Civic groups over NBC's premiere network broadcast of the film seemed to be less serious than originally reported; as practically every Italian we ran into that day said something like, 'Hey! The Godfather's on tonight!' AND in summary, we admit it, we love those Gangster Pictures. Most folks do. But our only real criticism of the Film and the Puzo Novel is that they both tend to raise the status of Don Corleone to that of being something that a real Gangland Boss would not ever be. By way of a comparison, let us just say that Vito's conscientious and benevolent characterization is an extreme and a sophomoric falsehood. It rings no truer than the persona given to mythical Nevada Senator Geary(G.D.Spradlin) as a completely evil, patently dishonest & ruthless louse in THE GODFATHER, PART II, (1974).NOTE * The references are thought by many to be of Frank Sinatra's getting the part in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY over Columbia Pictures Mogul Harry Cohn's preference for Eli Wallach. Maybe, but again, maybe not.AND remember, Schultz, the answer is no about the singer character. He was Johnny Fontaine, not Frank Fontaine (Crazy Googenheim in the Joe the Bartender segment of THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW (CBS, 1960's)!)",10,2,5,12 February 2009
