Mission: Impossible III," Action how it must be!!
","A Super Blockbuster, Frenetic with a lot of action. When i went to see this movie, i never imagined this was very spectacular. I have seen many action movies, this is not the best, but, really is intense, rhythm is accelerated with some funny moments very exaggerated.J.J. Abrams know how to make entertaining stories, now, with his first movie for the big screen, shows his imagination to create tense sequences and keep suspense on very high levels. He did not worry to develop a serious screenplay, just he gives some dramatic moments to create an Ethan hunt more sensitive and human without to forget explosive action scenes.I need to confess i liked more the Abrams' style than John Woo's and de Palma's styles, just in this motion picture because when Brian de Palma is concentrated is insurmountable (remember 'The Untouchables').Maybe this is the best movie of the saga, very enjoyable!!",7,0,0,1 January 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wow!
","Maybe this motion picture is the best movie ever-made (Well, this is not, The lord of the Rings is better).I liked a lot 'crouching tiger, hidden dragon' because it is not typical martial arts movie only with spectacular fights, since the movie shows another qualities from Chinese culture as philosophy. The motion picture shows the talent from Ang Lee before he would make 'brokeback mountain'.The movie is a banquet with spectacular fights accompanied of a beautiful love story. these fights were planned carefully, and it looks like a mortal dance. The best of the movie is the character played by Zhang Ziyi. She offers a master acting. She has talent and beauty in order to be a great actress. Simply gorgeous! The movie is spoken in mandarin Chinese, but, it will not be important if you understand the essence of the movie.You should watch the bamboo fight, it's incredible!",10,4,7,20 December 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," This is Halloween!
","I have just seen Digital 3-D version of this Master-Piece from Tim Burton's imagination. It's the same but now, you have the opportunity to see it again with the technology on 3-D and on the big screen.Fabulous tale about Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king, a lord of the Halloween celebration, who, annoyed of that celebration, he is looking for something new. Then. he find the Xmas celebration, this causes a great impression to him. Thus this is arming a magical film, with dark characters as much as charmers. With gorgeous scenes on stop-motion animation, Burton as a creator, Sellick as the director, bring us a story about love, fantasy, dreams, and good intentions, despite of our characters come from Halloween Town.Burton teaches to us how to create stories on a dismal atmosphere, but with a kind essence, all his filmography show it (Edward Scissorhands, The Corpse Bride, BettleJuice, The Big Fish, etc.). Selick, by his part, dominates the art of Stop-motion animation, like he did it in 'James and the Giant Peach'.Maybe it was very dark for Disney, but, with the step of the years, Nightmare Before Christmas has turned into a cult-movie.",9,2,3,25 December 2006

Am√©lie," Charming!!
","I have seen movies about romance and honeyed things, but Amelie overcomes any movie about this topic. Simply incredible! without words to explain this masterpiece. A simple story about Amelie (a terrific Audrey Tautou) a girl who notices how to make feel well to another people, but she is not completely happy yet.With this argument, Jean Pierre Jeunet builds a tale combining fantasy and surreal elements with live and real action. We know how Amelie feels through her fabulous way to see the life. Amelie falls in love with Nino and literally melts when she sees Him; and her strange but gorgeous and charming way to captivate his attention turns out simply wonderful, and makes to the movie a story worthy for watching every time when you feel so sad.You must see it!!",10,2,7,6 January 2007
