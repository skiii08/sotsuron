The Hangover," Exciting, Hilarious, Vulgar and Fun!!!!
","The film features four friends and is about a stag night gone very bad in the city of Vegas. The comedy is strictly a R- rated comedy. They get drunk and wake up next morning in their hotel room to find the groom(Doug) missing. There's a chicken wandering around, a baby in the cupboard and a tiger in the bathroom. The entire hotel room is in a disarray and they simply cant remember anything that happened to him last night. With time passing by, they slowly come to know about the adventures they had last night including a showdown with Mike Tyson. Meanwhile, a mafia gang orders them to give them money in return of their missing friend. The gang leader Chow(Ken Jeong) delivers one of the best comic performances. The final show is a race with time as the 4 friends just manage to reach in time for Doug's marriage. All of the 4 characters has a story to tell regarding their situation in their personal life. For example, Stu, the dentist is ruled by his bitchy girlfriend and he wants to let go of her. Alan(Zach) delivers a breakthrough performance and carries the film on his shoulders. The film is a laugh riot with a lot of vulgarity and it deserves every letter of it's R rating. The sequences that happened in the night leading to Doug's absence are hilarious and something not to be missed. Go, watch the film, it's a gem of a comedy.",8,1,2,28 August 2015
