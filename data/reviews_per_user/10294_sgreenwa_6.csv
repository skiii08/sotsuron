The Legend of Bagger Vance," This movie falls flat
","While the overall success of this movie cannot be blamed on any of the acting performances or the director, this is a flat, boring movie. it takes far too long to get into the heart of the story, and when you do, it doesn;t really pick up pace like it drastically needed to. My favorite movies happen to be time piece dramas.....it's not like I am an action genre fan. However, this movie is completely limited because of the script and the story line in genearl. It wouldn't matter who played the roles and who directed, the movie would have fallen flat. The biggest problem is that the movie focuses far too much on the overall theme......they try to smack you upside the head with the theme time and time again.....it is forced, and the theme is pretty generic......Worse yet, and most importqantly, the characters have no dperth to them......they are boring and you never quite fully understand where they were in the past to care about them in the present. They try to elude what these characters were like before we get to the present, but they do it in such a shallow fashion, that we never really know any of the characters, nor do we dare about them. Bagger Vacne(Will Smith) is a forced, generic, unnecessary character, just their to swarm us with his annoying logic on life...and we never know where he got this logic from....he is just a mystical chracter who we are not allowed to know anything about. Runnolph Junah(Damon) is scared from his past, and we know so little about that past when he was in war...We know he returns home a different guy then when he left and that he has lost his swing(he was an up and coming golfer legend before he went to war). Now he is home, a drunk, and trying to drink away the memories....He makes the transition from drunk to golfer again literally in the snap of a finger......it is VERY unrealistic. And Charlize Theorn's character, no matter how hot she is, is a waste as well....We never feel like we know enough about her and Damon's past relationship to care what happens with it now...Their romance could be the weakest, unbelievable portion of the filme. There is never a level of excitment or conflict that can make this movie anything but drab. A River Runs Through It is one of my all time favorite movies. In that film, a more boring topic than gold was chosen...that of fly fishing, but you cared about the characters...you felt like you knew them, and because of that, yoiu were drawn to the entire movie....The Legend of bagger Vance comes no where near achieving this. It is one of the biggest disappointments I've seen in a while for I was psyched to see it. It looks pretty on the outside, but it's rotten on the inside...a very shallow, one dimensional drab film.",5,0,1,5 November 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," Sleeper....in terms of it put me to sleep!
","Boring. It put me to sleep. Choosing Colin Firth as the leading man was a bad call. He had as much life to him as a dead cow. I mean, there is only so much of an overweight Renee Zelweiger in panties you can take. After a point, this is just another routing love story that we have seen time and time again, but there are some naughty words and english accents thrown in. Yipee. What was the hype about?",4,1,2,25 October 2001
Gran Torino," Terribly embarrassed for my boy Clint
","This movie is simply plastic, thin and irrelevant. It felt like pieces from 12 other movies patched together. Everything about the film is painfully predictable...there's nothing original about this. It felt like The Karate Kid meets My Bodyguard. Clint's racism and bigot-ism is SO one dimensional and over the top that it feels completely phony. His character arc(the transition from racist to racist with a heart) also feels quite forced. The acting was literally embarrassing for just about every character but Clint. No one could deliver a darn line in this movie. They all felt like first time actors!(their ethnic backgrounds weren't the reason...the Father and Clints son's were the same way and they were white.) The humor was so generic, completely dependent on the impact of one liners....situations quite void of laughs. The antagonists were only in the film just enough to know who Clint is going to have to face at the end of the movie, but nothing more than that to make any kind of impact in the film. How about giving them some personality and a reason to be the baddies they are? How about maybe attempting to make them come off 3 dimensional? They were terribly constructed and their overall impact was null because of it.At the end of the day this is simply a fish out of water movie, like thousands of others, where an outsider gets to learn a new culture and try to save the day for them, the only difference it's being made and led by a legendary movie God who seemingly has finally gotten to the point in his career where he IS willing to make films WELL below his abilities if he has nothing else to work on. I used to think Clint was one of the few unwilling to sacrifice quality for screen time, but this movie has shown me even Clint is human. I can't emphasize enough how much I respect/love his work.....but this movie was awful...Im CONVINCED his worst. My buddy and I spent half the time cringing from how embarrassed we were for him, and the rest of the time making fun of it. It was that hollow and pointless. For people making it out to be like it's the next great cinematic piece of history....I have to ask if this was the first movie you've ever seen. I see about 100 films a year and I can say with confidence that this film had the most on the nose dialog, the most exposition, the most generic and predictable storyline, the worst acting.....all of the above. It all stemmed with the script. This was an awful script from beginning to end and even the great Clint Eastwood and his multiple talents couldn't save it. Why he chose to make this we'll never know. But please do not read these glowing reviews and get your hopes up when going to see it. I'm astonished by how people are gushing over this. I walked out in disbelief. THE MOVIE OF THE YEAR IS FROST/NIXON.",1,33,74,2 January 2009
American Gangster," The movie falls flat...you want it to be more than it is
","When you put two of the best actors of the past 25 years on screen together you expect to be riveted. I can actually say that neither had memorable performances. I'd go as far as to say it felt like both were going through the motions here. I saw this with a buddy and we both walked out feeling the same way..entirely underwhelmed. I couldn't identify one scene...NOT ONE....where I sat there and said 'That's why Denzel and Crowe are who they are....there is their genius at work'.The movie is awfully slow at times and actually bores you with the amount of details given. The first hour is terribly un-engaging. There is nothing you see here that you haven't seen in Godfather, Goodfellas, New Jack City, Blow, Scarface, etc. It's basically all of those movies put together, but without any memorable scenes.I'm sure some will talk about the violence scenes where Denzel has his fits of rage. I didn't find those moments overly believable or interesting. And what more is there to the movie in terms of powerful moments besides those? Even if those scenes did do it for you, unlike me, was there any other moments actually compelling where you say 'Wow....that was amazing'.I was telling people before I saw this movie that I thought even the trailer seemed pretty flat...I wasn't excited to see this because the trailer did little for me, but I hoped that it was merely a case of not wanting to give away the good stuff. In reality, there wasn't any 'good stuff'.I found all of the characters to be either one dimensional or clich√©. I'll give the movie a 6 because it's not a 'bad' movie by any means. It just falls way short of being what it wanted to be. When you look back at Crowe and Denzel's career, I wouldn't come close to mentioning this movie as one of their finest pieces of work.Not to try to compare apples to oranges, but the story-telling, the acting, and the tension in Michael Clayton is far superior to this film. I wouldn't consider this for any major Oscar Nominations.",6,11,24,5 November 2007
Bring It On," Are You Kidding Me
","Anyone who took their time to write up a long review on this movie has problems. The movie is attrocious. Case closed. It is NOT funny. Anyone who found it funny has a very shallow/weak/unsophisticated sense of humor. The movie is quite cliche, though whoever liked this movie probably doesn't know what that word means. It was boring, unoriginal, over the top, and not in a funny way, and just a waste of time. There was not one interesting performance. Kristen Dunst is definitely hot, but that doesn't make a movie. It was trying to be 'Clueless' and failed in every regard. This movie scoreas a 2/10, because Dunst is a sex object....outside of that, so sad.",2,1,3,14 June 2001
300," If You're Looking for another Braveheart or Gladiator, Keep Looking
","This movie is awful and it had NOTHING to do with the violence like for many. I am a movie fanatic and I am most specifically a history fanatic. My fav. movies are time pieces. My fav. show on television is easily Rome. I can't tell you how excited I was about this movie. Unfortunately, it was utterly awful.1. I DON'T CARE HOW VIOLENT IT WAS, that is not my gripe.2. I DON'T care how historic it was. Most movies fall far short of what really happened...I get that. That is also not my gripe.3. The dialogue was bar none pathetic. The worst i have seen in ages. People were laughing at the lines that many here have already made fun of. I rolled my eyes at least 10 times. 'tonight we dine in hell' takes the cake.4. How many times must we see the king shout to get his point across. It's supposed to be a Braveheart moment with the whole 'Freeeeeeeeeeedom', but never once is it effective. It's not effective because he does it a dozen times and he does it in moments where it's not needed. We also don't care about him or his gang of suicidal warriors like we did William Wallace and his men. Why? Simple. the character development is terribly hollow. They force it on you that 'Spartans can't afford to be emotional'. Okay...and because of that, just realize every time you try to have your over the top powerhouse inspirational moments, they're not going to affe4ct us the same way as say in a Braveheart...because William Wallace WAS emotional...and we related to him...and cared about him, and we felt for him when he suffered loss...but in this movie...you don't allow us to gravitate to these characters. Bantering back and forth in play while they chop peoples heads off is simply not going to warm us to these people so that the 'inspirational' moments have ANY affect. Like when the Captain's son is beheaded. In most movies your heart would be torn out in sorrow for the guy...but in this movie...it's just another head hitting the ground. They want to pull on your emotional strings, but they never pull it off anywhere and it's all in the setup and how much of a testosterone induced farce they set this up to be. It needed to have the dramatic pull of a Braveheart...a Gladiator...it had the storyline potential to give us that, but they butcher it from moment one and it's impossible to take ANYTHING serious.5. The Persian king was pathetic. everything about him. he wasn't scary, he wasn't to be taken serious...he was a farce who liked to wear women's makeup. AWFUL. And how they did his voice so that he was to seem god-like...AWFUL. he seemed like a fruit-cake...nothing more. 'i am nice. I will show them I am nice'. that is when I said 'that's it...Im out of here'.There was nothing to like about this movie...not a thing. I went in expecting it to be my fav. movie of the year bar none...and i actually walked out with 20 or so minutes to go. What a joke. I'll now go give it a 1/10 and the 1 is for the fact it was just under 2 hrs. if you're going to make an awful movie, make sure it is under 2 hrs please. They did, so they get 1 star instead of zero. Oh wait...there is no zero. My decision is even easier now.",1,102,183,25 March 2007
