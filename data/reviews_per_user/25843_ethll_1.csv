Skyfall," Worst 'Bond' ever..
","The Bond franchise has deteriorated to nothing more than just a mindless action hero movie with this one. Bourne was better and so perhaps even Stratham.. The worst of the DC Bonds so far. No wonder Mme Dench called it quits... Where is the elegance, the intelligent and eloquent script, the 'tongue in the cheek' one liners, the British humor? Fleming created a character from the real world of MI5/6 guys but expanded it to larger than life, crafty in every which way, outwitting his adversaries, seldom needing to revert to mindless violence and fiery explosions to achieve his goal. He had nifty gadgets from cantankerous old Q; a story in itself. Replaced by a nerd??? DC does not have that inherent quality of style and intelligence, he is all brute force and in this movie, comes out just about last in every physical encounter until the last 'stab in the back'; disgraceful 007!! Never hit a target with the trusty PPK. Destroyed the most iconic Bond car in the process at that. What a waste..",3,24,56,4 November 2012
