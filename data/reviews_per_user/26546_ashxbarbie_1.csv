Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," This movies is awesome!! My friends and I freaking loved it!!
",I don't like vampire movies!! But this movie is awesome!!!! I jumped like 2 times during this movie!! Please go watch it! It is absolutely amazing !! Even from the beginning it caught everyone attention. Usually it takes a minute for me to get into a movie but from the second it came on it completely caught my attention. Its not what I expected I thought it was going to be boring. We only watched this movie because it was the only thing playing at that time. So we was like whatever lets just watch it if its not good we will just leave. Not even close! I had to use the bathroom but I wouldn't DARE move because there was always something happening that you just didn't want to miss! Awesome movie! Go watch it NOW!,10,11,15,30 June 2012
