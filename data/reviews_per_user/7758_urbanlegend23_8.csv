The Longest Yard," Enough with the football, Adam!
","'The Longest Yard' (2005) Dir. Peter Segal Gosh, Adam Sandler really does need to call it a day with these mediocre football films. 'The Waterboy' was retarded and lame, bringing Sandler down from a once actually-quite-good-comedic-reputation. 'Yard' is better than 'Waterboy' but it is still nothing more than just another football movie from Sandler with a lame moral.It actually doesn't start out too bad. Courteney Cox-Arquette plays the bitch from hell with great breasts so well you're not left wanting her to wither and die in the closet she's locked in but to come out of there and join the football team herself. The situation which leads to Sandler being thrown in the joint is fairly humorous and well-filmed.Once he gets there, the film remains entertaining and puts Sandler's character in a tight spot, he is left to recruit an entire football team by orders from the nasty warden played by James Cromwell (perhaps spoofing his own role in 'The Green Mile'?) to play the guards, despite William Fichtner's vicious guard leader seriously disapproving of the competition.Sandler goes off about recruiting members of the football team to play, and in a jail full of huge, scary convicts, it isn't too hard to get together a team to bring Fichtner's guards to weak knees. I particularly enjoyed the basketball sequence, very cool, and the character of the enormous black guy who could lift an entire bench of his inmates up like they were flies, while all the time underneath being a bit of a big softie.The film is successful in that it works up a number of likable, funny characters, even though most of them are stereotypes. The draggy/cross-dressing stereotype is played on in a funny way when they become the official cheerleaders. The black guys, big guys who look scary but are nice underneath, all of that is here. All of these are obviously unoriginal and undeveloped characters but they remain fun to watch nonetheless.Less enjoyable to watch are the prison guards, though we see very little of them. When it comes time for us to finally feel sympathy for them and kinda like them a little bit, it's too late in the game (no pun) as we haven't had enough time prior to this development to give it any build-up. The battle between the prison guards and the inmates is also irritatingly far-fetched at times, it's doubtful that the guys doing time would be given enough freedom to gain access to the guards' locker rooms, or that they would be left alone in the projector room! But where the movie really falls from grace is the last half an hour or so, which feels like the entire two hours all in one go. The final game against the guards and inmates (held in a stadium to cheering fans, dear God) just drags on for too long, personally I lost momentum and interest after five minutes.Chris Rock is also wasted here, the resolution to his character is such a bad move for the film, showing that he was in 'Yard' to be nothing more than Chris Rock himself and make funny lines in the background. He had no relevance to the plot at all.Sandler himself is stomachable enough, I always like him better when he's not doing his crazy over-the-top antics ALA 'Little Nicky' and is just playing the regular guy facing off against incredible odds. The film's cast is actually quite impressive, with Burt Reynolds playing a supporting part with enough Reynoldsy charm to render him watchable, and Nelly being one of the film's highlights (!). Nelly even holds his own in a sort-of dramatic scene in which the guards continuously drop books while Nelly's character is doing library duty. He was very likable in the film and one of my favourite parts of it.Though the film has energy to spare until the last frame, Sandler doesn't know when to call it quits with the damn final football game, and he has to realise that watching guys to tackled OVER and OVER again (a Nelly song, in fact) may not be as enjoyable for an impatient audience as it is for him.6/10",6,3,7,11 July 2005
Troy," 'Troy' is a thrilling ride, one of the year's best and most underrated action movies.
","'Troy' (2004) Dir. Wolfgang Petersen I, like so many others, was expecting A LOT out of 'Troy' when I headed along to opening night and sat in the dark cinema, watching the action unfold. Initially, I didn't think as much of the movie as I now do. I gave it a 7/10 on first viewing, but I knew I had to see it again, it is just one of those films that demands multiple viewings.So I saw it again for History class (since it's not historically accurate, perhaps that wasn't the best idea). And I bought the DVD.And look what happened.I strongly suggest to anyone who was looking forward to 'Troy' in cinemas to rent or buy the DVD and give it another chance in your home. It is truly a much richer, perhaps even exciting experience, as your expectations have been lowered, and often this makes a movie-watching experience better.Anyone who is not tired of the two-huge-armies-face-off battles we've been seeing in 'The Lord of the Rings' films and now many other films following in that trilogy's footsteps will sure love the battles in 'Troy'. 'Troy' takes it's battle sequences very seriously and while they have an epic grandeur look about them, at the heart of the battle - men are dying, men are killing other men. It's not all about kicking ass in this film. The battle sequences are a little more graphic than you might expect, and they are certainly brutal.Brad Pitt, looking absolutely incredible here (the months of training sure paid off), shoulders the movie with much confidence and adds layers to his arrogant, self-centred Achilles. It's refreshing that Pitt, though technically the central hero of the piece, plays the character in a less likable way than you might expect. Achilles is unpredictable and dangerous, he was 'born to end lives'. As the greatest warrior in history, he is most definitely convincing.Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom play more emotional heroes, and while Bana manages to give Hector an awesome kick-ass edge, strong nobility and adds many dimensions to his heroic part, Bloom doesn't quite handle the job as well. I do not dismiss Bloom's part in the film to be the 'pussy' as so many have put it, but in emotional scenes, Bloom simply falls flat. His lines ('I'll hunt deer and rabbit, we can live off the land!') are often laughable due to bad delivery. It is more likely Bloom was put in this part for his looks rather than his talent, which is still in question by yours truly. I did like, though, that Bloom had a more realistic touch, the scene in which he faces Menelaus and fails to defeat him, running back to his brother, is nerve-wracking and powerful, not all men were great butt-kicking heroes, even back then, so it's good to see that put into the film, even if he does play the more 'pussy' role.One of my main complaints about the film the first time around was the unnecessary relationship between Briseis and Achilles. With more viewings, I have come to appreciate this subplot a lot more. As Achilles puts it, she gave him peace in a time of violence and war. Achilles is a character so often covered in other men's blood, constantly killing and fighting, that Briseis allows for Pitt to show the more sensitive side is actually useful to the character's development. Their final scene together is very emotional and the actors have genuine chemistry.Wolfgang Petersen was criticised for being too much of a claustrophobic director to take on one of the biggest films ever made, but he handles the epic, large scale of the film nicely, if perhaps maybe not using as many swooping, stunning shots as he could. I certainly would've liked to have seen more of the set of Troy exposed. In the inevitable fire-fuelled finale it is showcased brilliantly, but more of these kinds of sequences would've been useful for Petersen to shut his critics up. He does a good job with the film, rooting the battles in genuine emotion and intelligence, and giving it a distinctive, memorable atmosphere and artistic look.Perhaps as a historical piece, 'Troy' isn't the film you're looking for. But for sheer entertainment value, it is one of the best films of 2004. Again, I urge anyone who was disappointed by the film to rent/buy it on DVD and give it another spin, it's not a decision you'll regret, I know I didn't.9/10",8,389,680,11 May 2005
500 Days of Summer," A refreshing, quirky romantic comedy.
","(500) Days of Summer is a truly original and refreshing romantic comedy, that feels straight from the heart and relative to almost any audience. Every character, whether it be Gordon-Levitt's embarrassing drunk workmate or the quirky, totally unpredictable Summer herself, feels utterly authentic and any viewer should be able to relate back to the people they know. As well as a stand-out performance from Gordon-Levitt, the movie also offers a number of the year's most memorable and unique scenes. Expectation/Reality is a heartbreaking, perfectly edited split-screen sequence that dashes Gordon-Levitt's hopes of regaining Deschanel's love after they split. The film also perfectly captures that 'first love' feeling of being on cloud nine with the hysterical dance sequence.Overall, the film is as unique and vibrant as the character of Summer herself, and for a film fitting the description of 'romantic comedy' in this current cinematic climate, that's some feat indeed.9/10",9,1,2,10 August 2010
Drive," A very cool movie, bound to start a deserved cult following, and featuring a brilliant leading performance from Gosling.
","Ryan Gosling is fast becoming one of the most exciting actors working today. It's nice to see him overcome the 'heartthrob' status achieved thanks to his role in the overrated 'The Notebook' and work on genuinely interesting, and challenging projects like his latest, 'Drive'.The film thrives on his excellent performance. Whether getaway driving or charming Carey Mulligan, he's nothing short of riveting to watch. As an action hero, this guy makes Liam Neeson in 'Taken' look like a whimpering pussy in comparison. Simply put - he's awesome, and utterly sells this character. I look forward to another quality performance from Gosling in the upcoming 'Ides of March'.I was lucky enough to see this film at its (apparently) second screening in the world, at the Wellington International Film Festival in New Zealand. It was obviously massively popular during this screening, rousing an opening introduction speech (it was the festival's closing night film) and an enthusiastic clap from the audience at the climax. It's not hard to see why audiences embraced 'Drive'. It's both an unpredictable and exciting outing for action fans, but all the same well-observed and gritty, which will no doubt appeal to indie viewers.The film's stunning cinematography envelopes the audience in the proceedings. The adrenaline-fueled car chases are furiously shot and nothing short of thrilling. Director Refn's camera also beautifully captures the Los Angeles skyline and the sprawling lights of the city. It's some of the best photography there's been of this city that I've seen in a film.There are a couple of really well-filmed 'shock' moments worth mentioning. One is in a car parking building and one a hotel bathroom, both featuring gunshots. Both are jump-of-your-seat scenes at their very best. Refn constantly keeps the audience on their toes, and there's no way to predict what will happen next. That's one of the most refreshing things about 'Drive'.Carey Mulligan could've been utilized a little more, especially in the film's final third, where she sort of just disappears. It's disappointing because she really gives the movie a heart in her handful of scenes with Gosling. I was glad she wasn't reduced to a typical 'damsel in distress' role (the film actively avoided action movie clichés, much to my delight), but she could've been included somehow.Overall, it's small complaint in a very 'cool' movie that a lot of people are going to love. Is the movie likely to be a little overrated and over analysed? Probably a little. Is it going to start a cult following and does it deserve said following? Most definitely. It's a refreshingly unpredictable and well-made roller-coaster ride featuring another excellent performance from one of Hollywood's hottest talents in Gosling, who is proving himself to be one of the most reliable leading men in modern cinema.",10,99,199,27 August 2011
Pulp Fiction," Not a film I feel passionately about, but still an undeniably fantastic second feature from Tarantino.
","Quentin Tarantino had an immediate fan base following his career after the release of the excellent 'Reservoir Dogs' in 1992, which only grew significantly upon the release of the much-revered 'Pulp Fiction' two years later. Commonly referred to by many as one of the best films of the '90s, the film was simply a revolution, its impact undeniable. Many - perhaps the majority excepting those who prefer 'Jackie Brown' - consider 'Fiction' Tarantino's finest work. Countless film fans worship at its alter. Am I one of them? Not really. I think the film is fantastic for reasons I'll soon explain, but I don't passionately subscribe to it as Tarantino's best either. In fact, 'Django Unchained' is easily better, and this film has serious claims to that title from 'Inglourious Basterds' or 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' (YES, I think it's better than number one, okay...easily better, in fact).But why is this film so particularly popular? It's remarkably clever, pop-culture-hip, reference-heavy dialogue is one such reason. There's no wonder it won Tarantino and Roger Avary an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The technique on display only matches the words - Tarantino's patient, passionate direction and Andrzej Sekuła's stylish yet unobtrusive are a match made in heaven.The film is consistently tense, electrifying and unpredictable, and that is aided by its (at the time at least) unique non-linear narrative. It never complies with Hollywood movie clichés, and even in 2016 this approach is refreshing.Fans and viewers which of 'Fiction''s distinctive four chapters is its best. Some, like me, will place the first chapter (somewhat smug and self-satisfied, like Uma Thurman's performance on re-watches) and the last (overly convenient - how come nobody walks into a previously packed diner and interrupts the goings-on?) the worst of the best. They'll prefer the brutally tense mid-section involving the sexy anti-hero Butch Coolidge (perhaps a career-best Bruce Willis) and the darkly hilarious, clever Harvey Keitel-assisted murder clean-up. They are certainly the film's highlights for me. But the film encourages subjectivity (the suitcase, hello?) and perhaps these different interpretations are part of the fun of this wickedly clever, irrefutably influential modern classic.",9,1,2,25 June 2016
Crazy Heart," Bridges' much-hyped performance doesn't disappoint, but the film itself isn't a masterpiece.
","Crazy Heart has often been dubbed 'The Wrestler, Part 2'. This film's general premise is much the same (swap wrestling for singing country songs), and while this story works well enough, it can't help but compare to The Wrestler and feels inferior and almost a rehash of that film. The pace is slowed considerably by the extended musical performances, they frankly drag and distract from the more interesting personal struggles of the two lead characters. Bridges' much-hyped performance doesn't disappoint, he truly inhabits this character – flaws and all – and gives a gritty showing that is some of the best acting of his great career. Gyllenhaal, too, is superb, her and Bridges have a wonderful chemistry that is the film's highlight. Too bad Cooper's film stands as just good, rather than great, as he invests too much in the overlong musical sequences and not enough in exploring these two appealing characters and their believable connection.",7,1,1,10 August 2010
The Matrix," The Reality Beyond Reality.
","
The first time I saw The Matrix, I thought, this movie sucks! But a few months ago I took another look, and I loved it. It is certainly one of the best films of last year, it takes sci-fi and action a place where no other film has gone before. I actually hate science fiction films, but this one had we enthralled, intrigued, entertained and amazed. This movie is one of the best science fiction films this CENTURY has seen. 
I recommend you see The Matrix, it will entertain you and I don't think you will ever see the world quite the same again. Free your mind, with this incredible movie.",10,0,0,12 July 2000
Fantastic Four," Surprisingly entertaining.
","'Fantastic Four' (2005) Dir. Tim Story Going into 'Fantastic Four', I had absolutely no expectations, no good ones at least. I thought the trailers made the film look like a cheesy and dreadful mess and I was certain I would completely loathe this movie and it would turn out to be one of the year's worst films.As can be expected, this movie is not perfect, due to the main problem in blockbusters these days - the script. While there are some witty lines, some great comedic humour and a simple yet effective overall storyline, 'Four' suffers from some truly awful one-liners. Lines that particularly stuck out in my head after viewing were 'no, LETS!' from Jessica Alba's Invisible Woman and 'the day...of the FANTASTIC FOUR!' from Chris Evans' Human Torch. These one-liners will no doubt have the majority of viewers cringing in their seats, instead of on their feet cheering - which was probably the director's intent.'Four' also has some strange pacing. Though the movie remains entertaining through it's entirety, I couldn't help but feel that Victor Von Doom (played by 'Nip/Tuck''s Julian McMahon) came into play too late into the film. He made for a nasty and cool villain, and should've been used more effectively. His sequence where he intends to destroy the Fantastic Four group at the end of the movie is one of the movie's highlights as Von Doom really gets into the meat of the story and McMahon goes all-out, and he plays his part with glee and seems to be having a lot of fun. Since his material is some of the movie's strongest, he could've perhaps been incorporated more into the film's mid-section, though this is a flaw that didn't bother me nearly that much because it was simply just great to see McMahon, one of my favourite TV actors, on the big screen.As for the rest of the cast, Ioan Gruffudd has never been much of an actor (he was very mediocre in '102 Dalmatians' and last year's disaster 'King Arthur') and he doesn't do much to further his reputation in 'Four'. He seems to flounder under the pressure of his first lead male role, and just doesn't convince as the big-man leader of this group at all. His awkward American accent also gets irritating after mere minutes.It is thankful that the rest of the cast give much better performances than Gruffudd, McMahon already mentioned as a fantastically evil Von Doom, Alba strutting her stuff looking damn fine and in an enjoyable role as The Invisible Girl. Evans makes an impression with enthusiasm and charisma, and I liked that his younger character saw the upside of these powers rather than showing them as a burden ALA almost everyone else in the film, but it is a shame that time is wasted on his character doing silly extreme sports. They just feel like a way to try and get the attention of teenagers and even though I've never read the comic book in my life, I severely doubt that Human Torch had anything to do with extreme sports in them which was quite annoying.Michael Chiklis absolutely steals the show and gives a sympathetic performance as The Thing. It is a credit to Chiklis' performance that underneath all the (amazing!) make-up, Chiklis still makes this 'monster' a very humane and likable character, whom we can sympathise with throughout the film. I've never seen Chiklis on 'The Shield' before but I wouldn't mind seeing him in some more feature films as he impressed me a lot with his role in 'Four'.I loved the media-coverage side of the movie, which expanded on similar themes in 'Spider-Man' ('Four' is quite similar to 'Spider-Man' - Von Doom is a better Green Goblin), it was a nice original touch in a not-all-that-original-really movie. With Evans' Johnny Storm truly loving the media and lapping up all the attention he can get, while his sister (Alba) truly can't stand and the group overall feels the need to stay locked up away from public, it seems to mirror different sorts of celebrities, which was clever and entertaining to watch.The action sequences in this movie are not quite phenomenal, and there may not be as many as you think. They're not BAD action sequences but 'Four' also has a lot of comedic material and even (shock-horror!) some character development so the big action sequences come at the end of the film. This is a pretty spectacular final battle against McMahon, with each of the Four getting to use their stunning powers against him. The ideas of the superpowers are utilised to their full potential in both the action sequences and in some humorous scenes (Gruffudd's power in particular - watching him wrap himself around Chiklis and Evans reaction to him reaching under a door and undoing the lock are both very funny). The special effects are realistic while also maintaining a cool comic-book edge throughout the movie.Coming out, I was extremely surprised, in fact overwhelmed, at how much I had enjoyed 'Four'. I'm still sort of shocked I actually liked it as much as I did seeing as I thought I was absolutely sure to hate it. 'Four' was more than twice as good as I had expected, making it one of the year's biggest surprises.8/10",5,3,7,10 July 2005
