3:10 to Yuma," Amazing western by the underrated James Mangold
","3:10 to Yuma is a very good western film. It is high on themes and high on chase sequences and shootouts. The story concerns a small-time rancher who agrees to escort a captured outlaw to court in Yuma. Both the principal actors Christian Bale and Russell Crowe play off each other really well and in the end they have mutual respect for one another. Ben Foster, Peter Fonda and Gretchen Mol are good support. James Mangold has a unique style- all his films the character development trumps action and 3:10 to Yuma has just that. Of course the action- especially the last 30 minutes is amazing.",8,1,2,4 September 2018
Alien," The film that started an awesome sci-fi series
","Alien by Ridley Scott is a masterpiece of setting, production design, atmosphere, acting- all the mise en scene elements. The screenplay is lean and compelling and even though this is a big budgeted more professional approach, it is basically a monster chasing down victims in space. But all the characters seem real and relatable- which is down to the fantastic actors portraying them, and more importantly they are all on equal levels so that we really don't know who is bound to die and who will be the last man standing. Alien's atmosphere is so good it gave rise to several similarly themed films although none could better or even challenge Alien for its overall artistry.",9,0,1,21 September 2018
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's erotic masterpiece, misunderstood
","Eyes Wide Shut was the last film directed by the legend Stanley Kubrick and because it starred the then A list couple Cruise and Kidman, along with many sex scenes the film was way overhyped. And probably didn't live upto this expectation either critically or commercially. But now Eyes Wide Shut is being rediscovered as a cult and already there are a host of blogs and articles online talking about how great the film is. I love it- I think this is one of the finest psychological films ever made. It reeks of atmosphere and the story- based on an Austrain novel is very good. Go see this soon to be declared masterpiece.",9,1,1,22 August 2018
Heat," A masterpiece of action
","Heat is an amazing movie but with the people associated this is a given. Directed by the amazing Michael mann and starring De Niro and Pacino (amongst many others) Heat is a fantastic Los Angeles crime film filled with great dialogue, fantastic characters and amazing sequences. Really, the choices you have for top notch action is hard to decide but the bank shootout takes the cake. This scene became so legendary that it inspired an actual robbery. You have to see Heat if you like character based action films. This is a treat.",7,0,0,5 July 2018
