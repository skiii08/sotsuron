Blade Runner 2049," A modern classic
","Finally saw the new Blade Runner, I was very impressed. The story is smart, dark, mysterious, and pure steampunk Noir. The film constantly gave you just enough information to know what was going on and keep you interested, but never enough to spell everything out for you .  I love that this film doesn't talk down to its viewers and it requires an active viewing experience. The setting and the futuristic world presenpresented in the film was amazing. The CGI was truly breathtaking and didn't feel fake at all.Acting wise Ryan Gosling did a outstanding job. He really did a great job playing the stoic silent role. He constantly used his mannerisms and his eyes to emote his feelings to add a extra dimension to his character.Despite how much I enjoyed the film it was not perfect. There were a few loose ends by the end of the film that would have been nice to tie up. I personally enjoyed the length of the movie and the pace, but I can see some viewers becoming overwhelmed. I overall really liked it 8.5 out of 10.",8,2,6,1 October 2018
First Man," A well acted film with a unique perspective
","So I saw The First Man at the theater. I had mixed feelings initially about seeing this movie. I love Ryan Gosling, but I've been very torn with the director Damien Chazelle. Overall the movie was about what I expected. A well acted film with an interesting story, but with a few glaring issues that made it ultimately forgettable.The story of course covers the Apollo landing and Neil Armstrongs first steps on the moon. Instead of focusing on the actual moon landing though the movie shows the slow build up to the launch and human tole that was lost. The film also goes deeply into the emotional conflicts felt by Neil Armstrong and his family.The best aspect of the film was easily the film's presentation of the many failures and losses that led to the Apollo landing. You really got a feel for just how difficult it was for the early astronauts and their families. This is not the kind of film that defies these men, but really paints them as human beings pushed to the limit to achieve their goals.I also enjoyed seeing the backstory of Neil Armstrong that really paints him as a tragic hero. The movie did a good job capturing the emotional trauma he had to endure, but also showed just how his trauma impacted his relationship with his family.Acting wise the movie was outstanding. Ryan Gosling perfectly embodied the stoic and withdrawn Neil Armstrong. He really brought the character to life and made him a relatable figure. The film is also filled with a wide supporting cast of actors who all do a good job with the material.Now as far as the criticism of the film I was very underwhelmed with the actual scenes involving space. I kept comparing the movie to Apollo 13 and felt it really could not hold a candle to that movie. The film was also overly long and could have benefited from cutting out a few unnecessary subplots. While the director seemed to intentionally limit the scope and grandeur of the movie, it really took away from the overall impact of the movie. I was almost bored with the anticlimactic voyage to the moon. At times it seemed the film also wanted to throw elements of social commentary into the story, but this really only slowed down the plots advance.The First Man was far from a bad movie. It was exceptionally well acted and told a unique perspective on a iconic part of American history. Unfortunately the movie had some pacing issues and a few too many subplots. I can't help but think in the hands of a more experienced director this could have been one of the best films of the year. A 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,24 October 2018
It," Strong first opening film
","Just saw the new movie IT. I really enjoyed the film. They updated the gore and jump scares from the original, but stayed true to what made IT a great scary movie. The movie provided a nice combination of horror, suspense, and a coming-of-age drama. The movie really captured the spirit of the Stephen King novel. The kid actors were all outstanding. They had real chemistry together and were fun to watch all around. It is hard to find kid actors that feel like they are actual children. These kids felt like genuine best friends. They played together, joked around together, and helped each other out. These actors were the centerpiece of the movie and they made it work perfectly.The special effects were all around pretty solid also. It was a smart move dividing the film's into two parts, letting the kids roles and their interactions with It really shine. I did miss Tim Curry's voice though lol. A 8.5 out of 10.",8,1,1,2 October 2018
Hereditary," Best horror film I have seen in years!
","So I saw Hereditary at the theater last night. I am absolutely blown away. This was easily the best horror films of 2018 and one of the best I have seen in years.I won't go onto details about the plot as I don't want to ruin anything, but to say this movie played with your emotions would be an understatement. Not only did the film have me on the edge of my seat, but it constantly had me wondering where the film was going.I was all around impressed with the directing. For a first-time director Ari Aster did an outstanding job. He really channeled from classics like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist to make this modern masterpiece.On top of the directing the movie made amazing use of sound to not only scare, but to unnerve. The sound in the movie perfectly built tension that helped carry the film during some of its slower moments.It's rare for a horror movie to have acting as a selling point, but Hereditary delivers. I'm a fan of Toni Collette, but this may be her best role. She really portrayed the wide range of emotions someone going through grief experiences. Outside of the horror elements the acting alone made this film a credible family drama about loss.Of course just like so many great classic horror films this movie psychologically manipulates the viewer. The movie has a slow burn methodical plot progression that builds suspense and creates a feeling of dread. At times the movie is purposely slow, but of course this is just to build up for what will come. When the extreme elements of horror finally happen you are absolutely floored. There were scenes that made me cringe and will stay with me for some time. The gore and violence though all served a purpose, there were no cheap scares.The movie really plays with your expectations for a modern horror. This is not a jump cut horror film, no this is meticulously crafted suspense driven film that pushes the boundaries on modern horror. That's what I love about this movie. It is one of a handful of films that seeks to rebuild the horror genre into the suspense driven atmospheric journey that pushes the viewer to the edge of sanity. This is what happens when directors who love the genre get a chance to make a horror film. A 9 out of 10.",9,4,7,1 October 2018
A Star Is Born," First great movie of 2018
","So I watched the new adaptation of a Star is Born at the theater. I walked into the film with high expectations. I'm a fan of Bradley Cooper, but the 1954 Judy Garland version of a Star is Born is one of my favorite movies. I'm happy to say this was one of the best movies of 2018 so far.The movie has a simple but rich and compelling plot. In a fairy tale like beginning a talented struggling young singer meets and falls in love with a popular musician after a chance encounter and begins her ascent into music stardom. Of course what makes the movie so compelling is that it is also a precautionary tale about stardom and the impact it has an individual. The film also masterfully combines a tragic love story with a realistic depiction of alcohol abuse and depression. The film also manages to squeeze in a condemnation on modern manufactured music pushed out just to sell records. The movie had a lot to say, what did a great job saying it.Acting wise I was very impressed with this movie. Bradley Cooper has really demonstrated his range over the years, but this was one of his most memorable performances. Of course he aptly played the role of a charismatic and popular celebrity well, but it was his human depiction of substance abuse and depression that stole the show. I should also mention that this was one of Sam Elliott's best performances in years.On top of that I was absolutely floored by Lady Gaga's performance. Of course she was competing against a high pedigree of past actresses who have also portrayed this role, but she was outstanding. She managed to play both the mild-mannered insecure struggling artist and the rising pop musician in a believable manner. At times it felt like she was really living the role instead of acting. She also had a genuine chemistry with Bradley Cooper which really helped to sell their love interest.Of course speaking of Lady Gaga I have to mention the incredible music performances in this role. I'm not normally a fan of her genre of music, but her voice was so powerful and layered it added an emotional intensity to all of her performances. The range and depth of her voice really added quite a bit to the movie. I will be very surprised if this film does not get nominated for best original song at the Oscars.It should also be mentioned that Bradley Cooper not only starred but also directed in this film. It is quite brave to take on one of the most memorable stories in Hollywood as a first-time director. Bradley Cooper all around directed the hell out of this movie. The cinematography was great, the changes to the story were perfect, and he really captured what makes this such a compelling story. I look forward to his future endeavors as a director.My only real criticism being there were a few scenes that seemed to drag on and repeat them self. The film could have been cut down by at least 15 minutes or so which would have helped to tighten the flow of the plot.Overall I absolutely loved this movie. I think it was one of the best of 2018 and is the first serious Oscar contender of the year. It not only perfectly captured what makes the story special but added an additional element to make it feel original. Highly recommended, a 9.25 out of 10.",9,10,20,13 October 2018
Wind River," Great slow-burn suspense thriller
","I finally watched Wind River. It was a very well made neo-noir mystery. The acting was solid, but the directing was outstanding. The film really captured the area it was filming. The story was a simple slow atmospheric burn, but was very rewarding. Overall a 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,0,1 October 2018
Darkest Hour," Gary Oldman is magnificent
","Just got out of The Darkest Hour. Overall a very impressive movie. Gary Oldman was phenomenal. He transformed himself in every way to play Winston Churchill. He very well may win an Oscar for this role. The supporting cast was also all around excellent.Story-wise the movie did a great job examining the conflicted life of Winston Churchill. It didn't try to make him a deified figure, but instead showed him as a flawed human being doing what he believed was right for his country.The movie was on the slower side, but that's to be expected about a movie centered around political intrigue. In some ways this feels like a perfect companion piece to the movie Dunkirk. Both depicting the conflict involved at the beginning of World War II but from different perspectives. Overall a great movie, 8.5 out of 10.",8,0,1,1 October 2018
Captain Marvel," Fun, if formulaic action comedy that checks all the boxes for a big blockbuster hit
","So I just saw Captain Marvel at the theater. I did my best to ignore the insane amount of false moral rage surrounding the movie on the internet so I could walk in with a less biased perception. Overall I'm glad I gave this movie the chance it deserved. It wasn't a perfect movie, but it certainly was an entertaining origin story that further added to the Marvel cinematic universe.The basic plot of the movie acts both as an origin story for Captain Marvel and also a tie-in for the upcoming Avengers film. Acting as an origin film the movie checks all of the necessary boxes. It mixed elements of an intergalactic space drama, traditional super hero fare, and provided some great throwback references to the comics. I won't go into any details because I don't want spoil the plot, but overall it was a fun and action packed origin story.Of course at this point Disney has these films down to a science. As expected the movie seamlessly blends drama, action, comedy, and references to the larger Marvel Universe. It's a fun formula that really doesn't disappoint on a superficial blockbuster level. Once the film finds its groove it is hard not to smile at the mix of action and humor.I also have to mention how well the film captured the time period. Any 90s baby will get a kick out of the many cultural artifacts from that era. I literally want to watch the movie again just to catch so many of the references. Plus the movie loving paid tribute to Stan Lee. It may have brought a tear to my eye seeing him on the big screen again.The movie was pure eye candy. The graphics were absolutely phenomenal and brought Captain Marvel's cosmic level powers to life. Seeing her at full power really should remind the audience why she is one of the most powerful Avengers. All of the action is sure to entertain pretty much everyone.I didn't see any problems with the acting at all. Brie Larson is a phenomenal actress and she brought a nice combination of levity and badass attitude to the role. Of course what is not to love about seeing Samuel Jackson as a young Nick Fury?If you went simply off the online user metrics your would think this was a terrible film. It was far from bad, but it certainly had its issues. Pacing was a major issue as the second arc of the film really slowed down the progression of the film. I also felt like the movie never provided a big enough conflict to showcase Captain Marvel's power scale and artificially blunted her powers through most of the movie with a plot device. Of course that's the issue with introducing an overpowered character by Captain Marvel just to tie into fighting Thanos for a future film. Plot wise there were also a few events that were a tad bit too convenient and really weakened the overarching story.Captain Marvel hardly reinvents the wheel as a superhero film. It firmly follows the establish Disney formula and acts largely as an excuse to have Captain Marvel act as a MacGuffin for the Infinity War conflict. Still Captain Marvel was a very fun film. Ignore the hate online from internet trolls who love to play their false moral outrage at every turn. The movie wasn't perfect, but it delivered exactly what I expect from a Disney Marvel film at this point. A 8.25 out of 10.",8,1,3,8 March 2019
Us," Best horror film of 2019
","So I just saw US at the theater. Honestly this was one of my most anticipated films of 2019. Get out was amazing and Jordan Peele has such a promising future for horror. Thankfully, all of my expectations were met. Overall I would highly recommend US to all fans of suspense and horror.The plot of US was incredibly interesting. The movie was based upon an old Twilight Zone episode, but of course Jordan Peele added a fresh sense of originality that made US a modern horror classic. A seemingly normal family on vacation is confronted by a group of doppelgangers that are out for blood. From there the film spirals into a suspense-filled, blood soaked narrative that will play with your expectations and leave you on the edge of your seat.The movie is an absolute master class is crafting an interesting and innovative suspense driven horror film. The plot goes in multiple directions, but was still grounded in suspense and classical elements of horror. I genuinely was interested in the characters and the plots progression throughout the entire film. Plus the movie has just enough gore without coming across as unnecessary. I also have to say the movie had some genuinely funny dark humor moments.The movie did an incredible job crafting a thick and eerie atmosphere that will constantly give you chills. Everything from the timing, lighting, to the exceptional use of sound was incorporated to add to the film's overall suspense. The sound and soundtrack really felt like a central part of the film. The use of sound really added a nice chilling factor to a number of scenes. I love seeing a horror movie put suspense and atmosphere as a top priority.Directing wise Jordan Peele really did an outstanding job. His love for horror and music really came through in this movie. He incorporated a number of horror references and techniques without feeling cliche. There were so many small choices throughout the film he made as a director that really made US a special film. With US Jordan Peele proves he is not a fluke of a director. He genuinely cares about crafting smart suspence driven films that elevate horror films into legitimately great movies.As I already mentioned the plot was very interesting, but the excellent dialogue certainly added quite a bit to the film. The screenplay of the movie incorporated a nice mix of suspense, gore, dark humor, and plot twists to keep pretty much anyone entertained. The entire concept of the movie could easily come across as silly if not for the intricate screenplay. I really enjoyed the twists as well and in no way thought it was out of place. It remind me of when M Night Shyamalan actually cared about writing.Of course I have to mention the acting. There was not a bad performance in the movie. It is so refreshing to see a horror movie taken seriously by incorporating great actors and smart well delivered dialogue. Lupita Nyong'o was so great. It was fun seeing her play two completely different roles, but throw herself at both performances. The doppelganger concept of the movie could have easily come across as a cheap plot device if not for such strong performances.Now I really liked US, but it did have a few points that hold it back as a film. While I did laugh at the humor, a lot of it felt out of place. The character's reaction to events at times completely destroyed elements of internal believability. Plus the movie does have its share of characters making dumb choices for cheap thrills. With such smart writing these just seem like odd choices to make. I will add that the overall explanation for the backstory of film and some plot points had gaping plot holes. Nothing that really hurt my overall enjoyment, but plot holes are irritating.US was one of my most anticipated movies for 2019 and it did not disappoint. As expected from Jordan Peele the movie was smart, scary, and all around well-directed. The acting and dialogue really put the movie over the top for the genre. While it did have a few plot holes and cheap thrills, I enjoyed every minute of the movie. I highly recommend US to all fans of the genre as this is just a great example of how awesome a well made horror film can be. A 8.5 out of 10.",8,2,5,23 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Set a new standard for fun superhero movies
","So I watched Deadpool two at the theatre last night. I walked in with high hopes and I must say I was not disappointed. This is easily one of the most entertaining Marvel movies ever made.To start everything that was great about Deadpool 1 is still here but bigger. The 4th wall breaking humor was in your face and completely hysterical. I can't think of the last movie I laughed so hard in. The movie perfectly captured everything I love about the tone of the Deadpool comics.The movie managed to poke fun at other Marvel movies, other DC movies, and just about everything. Nothing was off-limits to Deadpool savage humor. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool was perfect as always. The other cast was great all-around as well.I really enjoyed Josh Brolin as Cable and the introduction would of Domino as a character was particularly badass. The writers really captured the frenemy relationship of Cable and Deadpool well in the movie. The movie also introduced a plethora of Marvel characters from the comics and paid homage to the X-Men in general. I really enjoyed the story overall. Not only did it constantly have me laughing but it also had some great action scenes and solid dialogue. Any fan of Marvel will love the movie, but pretty much anyone will appreciate the comedy. A 8.5 out of 10.",9,1,2,1 October 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Best Thor movie yet!
","Just got out of the new Thor. Easily the best in the series. Marvel has really figured out how to combine action, comedy, and fun stories into a movie. I absolutely love the character interaction and dialogue. Valkyrie was a great addition to the Marvel Universe. Not only was she a much-needed strong female character, but she delivered some great lines. This is also the best movie for Loki's character development. He steals the show during almost every scene he is in.Plus all the fight scenes were very well done. They somehow manage to combine non-stop action with humor. I really didn't think I would laugh this much in a Thor movie. The fight near the end of the movie is particularly well-choreographed. This was the first time you really felt Thor's power as a god during a fight scene.Animation was great and it had some very funny moments. I really enjoyed the interactions between Thor and Hulk. The villain was a bit weak, but the fun factor kept me entertained. A 8.5 out of 10.",8,2,7,1 October 2018
Ready Player One," Oooooh shiny!
","I just saw Ready Player One in theaters. I was really looking forward to seeing this as I am a fan of the book. Plus being directed by Steven Spielberg only added to my excitement. Overall it was pretty fun.The animation of this movie is outstanding. Around 95% of the film is pure CGI eye candy. I loved the character design and the world the film crafted. It really felt like I was trapped in a video game world.The world the movie made was easily the best part of the film. I honestly want to watch the movie again just to try and catch every pop culture reference. The movie is pure 80s and 90s nostalgia at its finest.As far as the actual story it's not the most original and pretty predictable. The antagonist is a straightforward bad organization whose goal is to rule the world and all the protagonist are stereotypical good guys.I would say the characters are the weakest element of the movie. I had fun watching them interact, but they all felt pretty hollow.Directing wise Stephen Spielberg did a good job, but nothing outstanding. Other than doing something different I'm not sure what attracted him to this projectOverall very similar to the book, the movie was a lot of fun but unfortunately a tad bit shallow. I would have preferred if Steven Spielberg made the movie a bit more of his own, but it was still an enjoyable ride. A 8 out of 10.",8,0,2,1 October 2018
"I, Tonya"," Sweep the leg!
","I just got out of I Tonya and I must say I'm very impressed. The movie was outstanding. The story was told in a interesting manner, mixing perspectives on Tonya Harding's life and the events leading up to the end of her career. The movie had a nice mix of comedy and drama, feeling almost like a satire at times. The characters constantly broke the fourth wall adding a Goodfellas type vibe. All around it was an enjoyable watch. Acting wise the movie was really great. Margot Robbie was phenomenal. She really made you become invested in the character and sympathize with her in a lot of ways. This may be one of my favorite movies of the year 9 out of 10.",9,1,1,1 October 2018
Molly's Game," Interesting story
","I just rented Molly's Game from redbox. I must say I enjoyed the movie overall. The movie follows the true story of Molly Bloom as she maneuvers through the secret world of underground celebrity poker.Acting wise the movie was excellent. Jessica Chastain is an excellent actress and really brings life to her role. All around it was a great role which she really managed to humanize. She deserved her Golden Globe nomination and should have been nominated for an Oscar.Michael Cera did an amazing job playing a complete ass of a character inspired by Tobey Maguire. Idris Elba also did a solid job playing Molly's defense attorney.The movie was directed by Aaron Sorkin who also wrote the screenply. I'm a big fan of his writing style so the dialogue of the movie was its strongest point. It was a nice mix black humor, sharp wit, and rapid fire dialogue.Aaron Sorkin did a great job directing. The movie was very stylish and paid great detail to poker and Molly's life in general. The extra level of immersion put forth by the director really helped to make this an entertaining movie.The movie was a tad bit overly long though. I would have preferred if it was about 20 minutes shorter.Overall I really enjoyed this movie. It was smart, funny, well acted, and well directed. A 8.25 out of 10.",8,3,5,1 October 2018
BlacKkKlansman," The best Spike Lee film in years!
","I finally saw BlacKkKlansman at the theater. I really didn't know what to expect from the movie initially. The previews made it hard to tell if this was a comedy or a drama, plus Spike Lee has been slipping over the years. I'm happy to say I was incredibly impressed with this movie.The plot of the movie follows an undercover police investigation into Klan activities along the way exploring elements of institutional discrimination, prejudice, and race relations. All the while the movie also offers a stark commentary on modern day racial violence and hostility. The movie perfectly blends a serious drama with elements of dark humor to make a poignant and entertaining journey. The movie certainly has a message, but I never felt like it was preaching at you. At its center the movie remained a very well made, quirky, stylish, and thought-provoking film. I will say the film could have used a bit of tightening near the end. There were so many strong ideas in the movie that the love interest interaction felt a bit unnecessary and rushed. Acting wise the movie was great all-around. I wasn't aware of John David Washington before this film, but I will certainly look forward to seeing his future films. All around he managed to blend a mix of drama and comedy in is character while still keeping him human. Of course Adam Driver did a great job. He is quickly is becoming a must-watch actor in all of his roles.I also have to mention how well this film was directed. Spike Lee has been hit-or-miss over the past few years but he really put his all into this film. The film was masterfully well-crafted which further helped to immerse you into the story and message regarding racism. This is Spike Lee's best film in years. This of course should be no surprise considering it was also produced by Jordan Peele coming off of his success from Get Out.Overall I was immensely impressed with this movie. Not only was the plot interesting but it managed to combine a serious topic with dark humor in an entertaining manner. It is a very important film with a message that very much resonates with our current socio-political climate. I would recommend this film to pretty much everyone. A 9 out of 10.",9,7,15,9 October 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Best attempt at a teenage Spider-Man
","Finally watched Spiderman Homecoming. Overall it was pretty awesome. The movie had some genuinely funny moments that really captured Spidermans humor. The new Spiderman was a good choice and presented a realistic reflection of teenage Spiderman. I will always be a fan of Spider-Man 1 & 2 by Sam Raimi, but this particular adaptation perfectly captured the teenage Peter Parker. The action scenes were well done and entertaining. The story line overall was interesting and worked well with the pre-existing Marvel Universe. Plus Michael Keaton as vulture was outstanding. He made a developed well layered villain.My only real complaint being the changed a few parts of the Spiderman mythos for no real reason. Other than that a great movie overall, 8.5 out of 10.",9,0,1,1 October 2018
Interstellar," Stellar Interstellar!
",Finally got around to watching Interstellar. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it. From a technical point the film is a masterpiece. Truly stunning CGI and cinematography.The story was had a nice spin on a classic Scifi concept and kept me glued the whole time. Plus it added a few interesting philosophical questions about the nature of humanity and love. As expected From Christopher Nolan directing was outstanding. I'm sorry that I put off watching it for so long. Overall a 9 out of 10.,9,1,2,2 October 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," My favorite movie of 2017
","Just got out of THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI. Overall I was very impressed with the movie. The movie was a nice mix of a dark comedy and a crime drama mixed in. The writing was smart and original. Acting-wise the movie was outstanding. Frances McDormand is going to get nominated for an Oscar for this role. Plus Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell were great also. The story was interesting and kept you guessing. The best part was the dialogue. The lines delivered where witty and smart. The movie managed to have you laughing one scene and crying in another. A great movie worth all the praise, 9 out of 10.",9,1,3,1 October 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Long live the Queen!
","So I saw Bohemian Rhapsody at the theater. I absolutely love Queen so my expectations of this movie were incredibly high. Overall the movie has its strengths and weaknesses, but it is a must see movie for the year. It certainly deserves some criticism for sloppy directing, but it is impossible not to fall in love with Queen all over again while watching the movie.The plot of the film of course primarily focuses on Freddie Mercury and his complicated life while being the lead singer of Queen. The movie opens with a flashback to illustrate Freddie Mercury's immense talent, his rise to stardom, but also peppers in his descent into drug use, his acceptance of being a homosexual, and eventually discovering he has AIDS.In a lot of ways the movie reminded me of the film The Doors directed by Oliver Stone. It had an absolute perfect lead to embody the star in every way. It hit all the right notes showing the birth of all those iconic songs. It illustrates a morality tale of the difficulties of stardom. Yet despite all these strengths it was a ultimately flawed but enjoyable film.The first half of the movie is sure to please pretty much every fan of Queen. Essentially the movie acts as a greatest hits reel demonstrating the conception and performance of Queen's greatest hits. It was impossible not to feel a chill of excitement watching the birth of Bohemian Rhapsody. That of course being the film's greatest strength. It really immersed the fans into the music and mythology behind Queen. The film certainly played it safe in that regard acting as a straightforward fan pleasing look into the inner workings of Queen. That is not a bad thing as it really made those scenes and the iconic songs come to life.The movie also demonstrates Freddie Mercury's acceptance as a homosexual. The movie shows the struggles and difficulties he faced as he came to terms with his wife and his difficulties living a homosexual life in that era. I would have preferred a bit more social commentary on homosexual discrimination and the AIDS epidemic, but the film only lightly used these issues as a backdrop. Still the emotional conflict between Mercury and his wife was intense and really added a great deal to the movie.Of course the film also depicted the momentary fall a Freddie Mercury into drug use and debauchery. The depiction of Freddie Mercury here and his poor choices, the film says is the reason Queen faced any real hurdles as a band. This aspect seems to unfairly paint Freddie Mercury in a corner while leaving the surviving members of Queen squeaky clean. Seems a tad bit biased and one-sided. This of course being no surprise as the living members of the band were actively involved in the production of the film.Acting wise this film was utterly amazing. Rami Malek will get nominated for an Oscar, simple as that. He embodied every aspect of Freddie Mercury. His voice, look, mannerisms, and style were all perfectly captured. This wasn't just some caricature of Freddie Mercury, it was a genuinely amazing performance. To say he made the movie would be an understatement. This is the role that could launch his career into mainstream movies.Directing wise the movie seemed to have a difficult time finding its voice. Of course the movie had a complicated history in its creation with Bryan Singer walking off set and being replaced halfway through filming. This really shows as at times it seems like the movie doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Is it a simple people pleasing biography? Is it a comedy with Mike Myers in a prosthetic mask?Is it a complex morality tale regarding the dangers of excess and stardom? Is it focusing on the struggles of Freddie Mercury or the struggles the band had to go through because of Mercury? Ultimately the film suffered a bit from a lack of a consistent tone and vision.Bohemian Rhapsody is certainly a must-see film. The reaction in my auditorium of people standing and clapping really hammers that point home. It will certainly make you want to listen to Queen and all of their iconic hits. It also shows the complicated genius that was Freddie Mercury and the struggles he encountered. I'd largely recommend this movie purely to see the incredible acting talent. While certainly not a perfect film, it was a very enjoyable one. A 8.5 out of 10.",8,2,2,12 November 2018
Bird Box," And entertaining but ultimately unsatisfactory psychological horror film
","So I saw Bird Box on Netflix. I normally do not get too excited about Netflix originals, but I do like Sandra Bullock plus I had a few recommendations from some friends. Overall it was a bit of a mixed bag of a film.The concept of the film is quite interesting. A unknown entity is causing mass suicides across the planet. The meat of the film is a psychological thriller showing a group of people trying to survive in the apocalyptic chaos. The film itself takes place through a series of flashbacks demonstrating how the world fell apart and just what a 'bird box' is for.The film had a very strong beginning. I genuinely enjoyed the setup of the film and wondering just what was going on. The film does a good job of initially building tension and intrigue to craft an atmosphere that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I also really liked the way the film handled the 'bird box' monster entities. Some people may not be satisfied, but ultimately they served more as a MacGuffin to push the narrative along.There were also a number of gruesome kills in the movie that came out of nowhere and felt genuinely shocking. There were a few smart underlying concepts regarding loss, alienation, grief, and depression that the films touches on. The movie did a good job with Sandra Bullock's character as well. I really felt attached to her and her emotional struggles as the film went along.The acting was solid all-around. Sandra Bullock is a great actress and she does her best with the material even with its flaws. Same thing with the supporting ensemble cast. I really don't have a complaint about anyone's acting. I will say there is no reason for Machine Gun Kelly to be in this film though. His character or story arc added nothing to the film.Ultimately though the concept is more interesting than the execution. The film felt very reminiscent of A Quiet Place with elements of the Mist and The Happening thrown in for good measure. Bird Box was certainly better than the Happening, but felt like an imitation of better films. This does not mean it wasn't entertaining. It certainly had its moments of intense horror and psychological drama.It does seem like the film was trying too hard to go into many different directions. Is it a smart psychological horror film? A gory monster flick? A meditation on human nature in the face of chaos? A survivalist tale of female empowerment in the face of dread? It just felt like the film never really found its voice with so many narratives.There were also some glaring pacing issues in the film. There was entirely too much filler in the film. It really could have been shaved down 30 minutes or so to make a tighter presentation. The film really began to lose steam halfway through. This of course being a shame considering the strength of the introduction. The middle dragged on, while the conclusion felt rushed and unsatisfactory. The movie fell short of its initial setup with a forced and anticlimactic ending. I won't go into any details regarding the plot holes, but there are a few head scratchers throughout the film that really hurt the internal believability of the film.Overall I liked Bird Box for what it was. It was a well acted film with an interesting concept that dropped the ball on execution. It certainly isn't a classic horror film, but it's not a bad Netflix original either. I would recommend a watch for anyone that has Netflix, but don't expect to be blown away.... and yes the memes are better than the film. A 6.25 out of 10.",6,1,3,3 January 2019
Baby Driver," Baby drives fast
","Just got out of the film Baby Driver. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The film was a nice mix of comedy, white-knuckle thrills, and in your face action. There really wasn't much that I didn't love about this movie.The way the film was built around the soundtrack was interesting and fun. I would be hard-pressed to name a film that meticulously worked with a soundtrack of the way Baby Driver does. Every song is at the centerpiece of a scene and they almost feel like roles in them self. Of course it helps to be soundtrack is just all around awesome also. Baby driver has a Guardians of the Galaxy level good soundtrack.The action scenes were all well choreographed and entertaining. The chase scenes were some of the best I've seen in years. It is impossible not to have fun watching Baby drive. The choreography with some of the best I've seen all year.The plot of the move is simple enough. Boy drives cars fast to help rob banks. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love with girl. Bad things happen and boy must save girl by driving fast. Simple, sweet, and a lot of fun. Mixed in is a rogues gallery of interesting characters that all have a life of their own.It also had just the right amount of charm in the plot and characters. Really solid film all around 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,2 October 2018
Justice League," A swing-and-a-miss for DC
",Just got out of the new Justice League. I can't say I was overly impressed. The story was rushed and unoriginal. I really didn't find any of the new characters to be very interesting or engaging. How hard is it to find a interesting villain in the DC Universe ?The movie also seemed to ignore any advancement from the characters seen in previous films. Wonder Woman is reduced to a punchline.  The animation was also surprisingly not up to par. Really underwhelming Overall. If DC wants to compete with Marvel they are going to have to do better. A 6 out of 10.,6,0,2,1 October 2018
Dunkirk," Nolan at his finest
","Finally got around to seeing Dunkirk. It was a very impressively made movie. The cinematography and directing in this movie were outstanding. This really is one of the best shot movies of the year.The dialogue was minimalistic, instead utilizing multiple perspectives to showcase the massive effort the evacuation of Dunkirk took. In many ways it reminded me of Tora Tora Tora, which of course is a compliment considering that's one of the greatest war movies of all time. Despite not focusing on one character, all of the characters and their actions depicted felt very human. The movie did a great job depicting the brutal effect war has on the human psyche. The movie constantly left you with a feeling of dread and did a great job depicting World War II combat. As a history buff I loved all of the tiny details added to the movie to make it more realistic. Overall Nolan did an amazing job with this movie. A 9 out of 10.",9,1,3,1 October 2018
Climax," One of the most immersive experiences I've had from a film.
","So I saw Climax a few days ago at the theater. I literally have not stopped thinking about the movie and the overall experience the film provided. Casper Noe is a master provocateur and he certainly made a film that will stay with you for days. I can't say it was an enjoyable experience, but I don't think it was supposed to be. It was an incredibly unique and jarring film that should be experienced though.The plot of the movie can be summed up easy enough without spoiling anything. 'Drugs are bad M'Kay'. The film follows a diverse group of dancers as they finish up an intricate and well choreographed dance routine. After a long and tedious introduction the film descends into a nightmare fever dream that is designed to provoke emotions and make you as uncomfortable as possible. The film certainly was a success in that regard.The movie was populated with acts of violence and depravity that will leave many in shock. One of the most terrifying aspects of the film being it was grounded in reality. All these depraved and shocking moments on screen were not exaggerated, but gritty and raw. This only further added to the experience the film provided.I'm having a hard time really classifying this film under any given genre. It certainly had elements of psychological terror and put forward a number of disturbing scenes, but it's not quite horror. Hell it's almost hard to classify this as a film in the first place in the traditional sense. This feels more like an interactive art project than a coherent story.Like the best abstract art this movie acts as a Rorschach test designed to push viewers experiences. I normally don't read other reviews before writing my own, but I had to see how other people interpreted the film. Is it a philosophical meditation on human nature? An allegorical masterpiece? A product of insanity or genius? Is it pretentious nonsense? Or is it simply exploitive trash? It can be all those things and much more. It was an experience that demands to be felt. I can't say I enjoyed the film, but it was one of the most immersive experiences I've had from a film.Climax asks the audience a complex question. Is art designed to be enjoyed or experienced? In the case of Climax the movie is designed specifically to provoke an emotion. Climax wants you to feel something as a viewer. Something primal, uncomfortable, and anxiety inducing. It's the kind of jarring experience that will leave you in shock for day. It was the kind of experience that will really make you think about the movie. Climax demands that you are an active viewer. It really pushes the boundaries of what it means to be a film.From a purely technical point this movie should be seen anyway. The cinematography and choreography were outstanding. Of course all of the dance numbers were intricate and well done, but the most impressive aspect being how they were shot. The film utilizes single takes for long stretches of time all the while the camera seamlessly floats around capturing some truly wonderful scenes. There's almost a 20 minute stretch without a single cut all the while the camera acts as an omnipresent viewer following different characters and their drug-induced stupor. Plus the color and lighting of the film were perfect to push the changes that occurred in the narrative of the film. It's not my genre of music, but the techno dance soundtrack was also perfectly incorporated. The technical aspects were the best part of the film and really stand out.That all being said Climax was not what I would call a good movie in any traditional way. While the film is relatively short, around 40 minutes of the movie was literally nothing but mindless dialogue and dancing. This wasn't a case of a slow burn start to build suspense. It was a tedious and mind-numbing experience just to make you feel uncomfortable. There simply was no driving plot for the bulk of the film. All of your expectations as a viewer ultimately fall flat as the movie never really delivers on its promise providing terror. I will also add that while yes, the scenes were designed to be provocative, I have certainly seen worse in film. The content didn't make me feel uncomfortable as much as the movie itself did.I also have to mention how utterly terrible the acting and dialogue was. All of the dialogue felt utterly pointless and added nothing to the film. It would be one thing if the actors delivered their lines in a believable manner, but they all failed to do so. The whole thing felt far more like a College term project instead of a major film. I will also mention that the abstract and allegorical aspects of the film were purely unintentional on the directors behalf. He has gone on record saying the film is not a allegory and ultimately he wasn't making a social or political statement. Sometimes viewers read into things that simply aren't there.So Climax was one of the most disturbing experiences I've had since Salo. In both cases the films weren't truly scary, but they were uncomfortable and anxiety inducing. Climax is less of a coherent film and more of an art project. It is the kind of ultimately pretentious content that will have critics raving. I did not enjoy Climax as a movie. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the film and I liked that they tried to make an immersive and powerful experience. The film was very successful in that regard. As far as crafting an intricate psychological thriller this movie falls flat and will leave many bored and scratching their head wondering what the hype was about.This is an incredibly difficult film to try and rank numerically. It succeeded in everything it was trying to accomplish, still it had too many glaring issues for me to call it a good movie. I would still highly recommend everyone watch it though for a unique and powerful experience. Climax will certainly make you feel something as a viewer and if that is enough for you the film is sure to wow. For me it was just a muddled nightmare that tried way too hard to be cool. 6 out of 10.",6,1,2,17 March 2019
The Favourite," My Favorite film of 2018!
","So I saw The Favorite at the theater. I was really looking forward to the movie. It has an absolutely phenomenal ensemble cast plus the director Yorgos Lanthimos knows his way around an interesting and provocative film. Overall I was blown away with the movie. It may be my favorite film of 2018, pun intended. If nothing else it might be the best made film of 2018. I cannot recommend the film enough to everyone.The plot of the movie is very unconventional. This is not a movie with a grand historical scope. There are no intense battle scenes or extravagant narratives. While there is a war that occurs during the film it merely serves as a plot device to carry the actual narrative. The real meat of the movie is the political intrigue and rich dialogue. Pretty much the entire film takes place at the Queens royal estate. This is an immensely sharp and witty film that constantly plays with the viewers expectation. It somehow perfectly mixes elements of comedy, drama, and suspense perfectly to keep you entertained. I can say I was completely engaged the entire time.Instead of an epic narrative we witness the political and social struggles of two women as they fight for the affection of the queen. One a social climber hell-bent on achieving wealth and prestige while the other is a seasoned political matriarch who controls the kingdom from behind the scenes. In a complex mental chess game these two women attempt to outwit each other at every turn. They lie, cheat, steal, and even use sex to their advantage. It's a film the asks the question how far would you go to live a life of luxury. In many ways the film seems like the bastard child of Game of Thrones, The Lion in winter, and Barry Lyndon. This of course is high praise considering all three are at the pinnacle of political dramas and amazing dialogue.The genius of the film is in the rich textual layers of dialogue that are the center of every interaction. I haven't seen dialogue so smart and biting in a long time. It somehow is hysterical, but at the same time manages to not come off as campy and overdone. I had so much fun watching two people throw backhanded insult at each other all the while in the context of a royal palace.You really starting to love and hate most of the characters at the same time throughout the film. All of the characters were exceptionally well-written and very engaging. Everyone had their own agenda and motivations that felt genuinely human. There was no glamorizing the human condition here. Human nature was Illustrated raw and animalistic.The film was also a critique and attack on the decadence and disconnect that elites in higher social classes embody. The film illustrates how far removed the wealthy are from the struggles of the average man and that they have no problem manipulating and using individuals to their advantage. The movie also offers social commentary regarding gender norms and ideas of sexuality. Concepts of masculinity and femininity are questioned while the film also offers critiques on The Cult of Femininity. It was all around an incredibly layered film that says quite a bit while never coming across as preachy.Of course this might be one of the best acted films of the year. Other than the TV show Peep Show I wasn't very familiar with Olivia Colman. That was my mistake. She was absolutely incredible. She perfectly embodied the characteristics of a power drunk yet fragile Queen Anne. At every turn she brought something new to her charater that made the queen a richly complex figure. She also had physical and mental transformation as the film went along that would make Daniel Day-Lewis stop and take note. She deserves an Oscar for this role.Rachel Weisz is another actress that I was blown away with. I know her from a few separate roles but I was never very impressed. She always seemed like a competent, but forgettable actress. This roll completely changes how I feel about her. While the dialog was sharp her delivery was incredible. She brought so much to a well-written script with this performance. She really held a number of scenes together with her screen presence alone. I absolutely loved her in this. I can easily see her being nominated for best supporting actress.Of course I have to mention Emma Stone. Now I greatly dislike Emma Stone. She has some good roles, but there's something about her I can't stand. That being said this was easily one of her best performances. She managed to portray the wide range of emotions her character embodied throughout the film while still remaining very human. She could play sweet and naive one moment followed my cunning and brutal the next. She easily made a character fans could love to hate.Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz genuinely had some great chemistry together. The film provided an absolutely incredible ensemble performance worth seeing for its acting alone. While it's easy to overlook his performance in the face of so many strong leads Nicholas Hoult really did a good job also. His character was hilarious and provided some memorable scenes.If this film doesn't get nominated for best director then something is wrong. Yorgos Lanthimos made an absolute masterpiece of a film. He is known for his quirky and often out of this world storytelling. This is the man that brought us the Lobster which was such a bizarrely unique ride. With The Favorite he managed to tell a story in such a complex manner that is almost comes across that we're watching a play. He took a subject that was ultimately irrelevant and made it captivating. One of my personal favorite elements was his incorporation of sound. The score was outstanding, but the way he used it brought so much tension and life to every scene. The score felt like a character in itself that Incorporated an additional layer of depth to the film.Plus there was some truly stunning cinematography throughout the film that made the movie pure eye candy. The film is absolutely beautiful in so many ways. It perfectly captured the decadent aesthetic of the era. The costume and set design were flawless. You really felt like you were witnessing the day to day world of those living at the Queens manor.I loved the movie. The only real criticism I can think of deals more with viewer expectations. If you walk into the film expecting a rich historical epic you are going to be disappointed. If you are expecting action and a grand narrative you will be disappointed. If you expect something other than two hours of dialogue and political intrigue you will be disappointed. If you want a realistic portrayal of history you will be disappointed. If you want a story with a conclusion that is tied up with a nice bow you will probably get angry at the ending. It's hard to fault a film however for things it was never trying to be.The Favorite is officially my current pick for this award season. The movie offers so much to its audience, but you have to be an active viewer. The film has some of the best dialogue I've seen in years and utterly flawless delivery. The characters are complex and interesting and their interactions absolute carry the film. Technical wise this is the best film of 2018. I recommend it to everyone as this is certainly a must-watch film. It may not be for everyone, but it was a truly unique and engrossing experience. A 9.5 out of 10.",10,34,68,22 December 2018
It Follows," Love it!
","Rewatched the film It Follows. This is the third time I have seen the film and it only gets better with each viewing. The film is a master example of utilizing suspense to create terror. It's slow paced, but perfect in its execution. The entire film creates a steady stream of paranoia and anxiety that leaves a lasting impression on its viewers.I love the use of sound in the film also, it really added to the feeling of dread. The plot is simple, yet also plays as a precautionary tale. Plus the monster of the film is terrifying and trully adds an extra element of horror to the film. Overall a 9.5 out 10.",9,1,1,2 October 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Nonstop Marvel action!
","I watched Avengers Infinity War last night. This movie was 10 years in the making so I was very hyped to watch it. Fortunately it lived up to my expectations.To start the movie is pure eye candy. All around the movie had amazing CGI. There was something happening every few minutes that was near breathtaking. It really captured the magic of the comic books.The movie was also completely epic in scale. Everything was bigger for this movie. The fights were intense and in your face and really showcased everyone's super powers.I also thought the movie did a good job with character interaction. Everyone's favorite superheroes all had their moments to shine. It was also great to see all the superheroes interact with each other.I really liked Thanos as a villain also. I think he really lived up to the hype as a good villain. I'm really looking forward to the next movie to see how his character evolves.Story-wise the movie wasn't bad, but let's not kid ourselves this movie was an excuse to see all the superheroes together. The movie did exactly what it said it was going to do. Provide a fun and intense superhero Blockbuster.The movie does have a very steep learning curve though. It requires you to have seen all of the other comic book movies to really understand the scale of what's going on. This is also one of the few Marvel comic book movies that isn't quite kid friendly. The movie is pretty dark and lacks the humor most of the new movies have.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is easily the most epic comic book movie ever made. A 8.5 out of 10.",9,0,1,1 October 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino's Love Letter to film cinema and the first must watch film of 2019!
","So I just saw the new Quentin Tarantino movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood at the theater. This was easily my most hyped movie of the year. I absolutely love Quentin Tarantino so my expectations were very high all around. I am happy to say this movie met my expectations and went beyond. It may actually be one of my favorite Tarantino films and easily a major Oscar contender.In typical Quentin Tarantino fashion the plot of the movie is all over the place. The film juxtaposes a few real life actors into one leading man, Rick Dalton as he and his aging stunt man come to term with their less than Blockbuster status in Hollywood. Of course the meat of the film involves incredible character interactions mixing action, humor, drama and suspense to make a truly fascinating love letter to cinema. Plus the movie incorporated the Manson Murders into the background as a fun plot device that really added an interesting element to the film.The movie had so many strong selling points as a film. In typical Quentin Tarantino fashion the dialogue was so sharp it is guaranteed to keep the viewer entertained. The movie really did have a perfect mix of comedy and drama, all while playing fast and loose with real life characters and events. I constantly found myself mesmerised at the screen with the dialogue and screenplay choices.This really felt like Quentin Tarantino's most personal film. The movie was an absolute love letter to cinema and the people that crafted films that were so influential in his career. As a fan of Cinema the movie was an absolute blast to watch. Picking up all the little Easter eggs left just for all the cinephiles out there was half the fun of the film. This movie absolutely demands to be seen multiple times.It would be impossible to talk about a Tarantino movie without mentioning the directing choices. The film was so expertly shot and directed it was almost hard to pay attention to the content because I wanted to pay attention to the technical aspects. The soundtrack as always was perfectly blended into the film acting almost as a driving character in itself. This easily was one of the best directed and shot films of the year.In every way Tarantino captured the era of the film and utilized a really cool play-within-a-play concept that really paid tribute to the art of film making. The concept really made for some trully memorable moments and really showcased the range of talent that went into this film. The writing and screenplay did a great job setting up the initial conflict and playing with viewers expectations. Despite having a large cast and switching multiple perspectives throughout the film the movie never felt bloated. Everything felt so deliberate and tied into the larger themes of the film.Speaking of talent Leonardo DiCaprio really made this role his own. Throughout the film he was forced to wear so many different hats as a character, but still kept his character grounded as a real human being struggling with life stressors. A lesser actor could not have played such a diverse and demanding role.Brad Pitt absolutely oozed charisma throughout the film. His character seemed to pick up from Inglourious Basterds and turned into one of Brad Pitt's best performances in years. He and DiCaprio genuinely had an outstanding screen presence together. I really can't complain about a single actor in the entire film. It is always nice to see the Quentin Tarantino regulars appear in his films.Of course like all Tarantino films this movie will not be for everyone. While I really enjoyed the dialogue-heavy sequences and multiple character perspectives, the film does have a way of rambling in a stream of thought kind of way. I could see people getting lost and wondering where the movie was heading. Plus the film plays very loose with historical facts. Both points feel a bit shallow criticizing in the film for however. It seemed Tarantino explicitly designed the film in such a manner.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has been my favorite film of 2019. It is the kind of movie that reminds me how much I love Cinema. From the smart and witty dialogue to the intricate directing choices the film is sure to please all fans of well made film. Sure the plot can initially feel overwhelming, but this is one of those films where the experience is more important than the ending. A 9.75 out of 10.",10,29,49,10 August 2019
Get Out," Get out and watch the movie!
","Finished watching Get Out. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film. The movie genuinely kept me guessing and perfectly used suspense to keep me hooked. It was a deep movie on many levels that really felt rewarding to watch. I really don't have anything to criticize about the movie. The acting was great, the dialogue was amazing, and the story kept me on the edge of my seat. What more can you ask for?The movie also made excellent use of its score and sound to heightened the tension in the film. A great suspense thriller overall, 9 out of 10.",9,0,2,2 October 2018
Aladdin," A pretty fun, but uneventful ride down memory lane.
","So I saw the new Aladdin at the theater. Honestly my expectations were very high. Aladdin is my favorite Disney movie of all time. While I knew it couldn't live up to the animated classic, all I wanted was a fun ride out of the film. Overall it was a pretty average mixed bag of an experience.I assume everyone knows the plot of Aladdin at this point. Largely the film remains untouched regarding the major plot points. Of course the film has altered a few small things and added around 30 minutes of content to the original script. Unfortunately I can't say those 30 minutes really added anything at all but length to the movie. There is a surprise fanservice story arc involving Jasmine that many will enjoy however.The animation and production design of the movie were outstanding. In every way the film and its setting were gorgeous. The movie was bright and vibrant and sure to please children of all ages. The setting and costume design were also very well done and presented a diverse and fun look into a live-action Agrabah City and its inhabitants. The movie was pure eye candy from start to finish.The musical elements of the film were mostly very well done. It's hard not to compare the song to their original counterparts, but the music was just as catchy as ever. I will say the original songs designed for the movie on the other hand were just very bland. There wasn't a single memorable new song in the film. That is a shame considering how many earworms the original Aladdin had.Performance-wise I honestly have to say Will Smith stole the show. I was very hesitant initially about his casting. Robin Williams performance was just so memorable. Will Smith pays respect to Robin Williams performance, but definitely makes this his own interpretation of the genie. Most of the other performances were very okay. Nothing terrible, but no other performance really stood out. I will say Marwan Kenzari's interpretation of Jafar was just bad. It lacked any bit of menace and intrigue and just came across as whiny. It is also criminal to not have Gilbert Godfrey play the part of Iago.Overall the biggest weakness of the film was finding a reason for it to exist. Sure it had its fun moments, but the best aspects of the film were direct copies of the cartoon. Why bother makeing a live action version if it's going to be a near shot-for-shot remake with extra unnecessary padding? I will add the 30 minutes of padding did nothing but slow down the film and add plot points just for fan service. The film was just far too long for the writing to carry. There is some also very cringe-worthy dialogue and humor throughout the movie. Of course kids will love those moments, but for a film based upon my childhood classic I expected more.Aladdin was not a terrible movie. It wasn't a disaster like Dumbo. It was however a wasted opportunity. It just feels so bland and devoid of the classic Disney Magic. Sure the film had a few strengths, but there's nothing about this film that makes me want to re-watch it over and over again. The original content was bloated and slowed the film down, plus the new music was a bore. It held my entertainment and my two-year-old loved it, but it did not wow me at all. It did however make me want to watch the original Aladdin. A 6.75 out of 10.",7,1,5,26 May 2019
The Lion King," A beautiful but ultimately shallow adaptation.
","So I just saw The Lion King at the theater. Honestly after the disappointment that was Dumbo and the mediocrity that was Aladdin my expectations were pretty low. How could Disney possibly make anything that could live up to the iconic animated classic? Overall I have to say I enjoyed the film. Sure it wasn't perfect and it was a shameless cash grab, but I still had fun watching the movie and it is sure to please a new generation of viewers.Of course everyone knows the plot of The Lion King. It is one of the most iconic animated films of all time. Honestly very little is changed regarding the plot. Ninety-five per-cent of the film was a near shot-for-shot remake so don't expect anything original plot wise. The film hardly reinvented the wheel, but the original Lion King was a blatant copy of another film so that's not really a negative.Where the film really shined however was the CGI and set design. This may have bene one of the most incredible lookingDisney films I've ever seen. The CGI was rich and layered and really captured all of the diverse characters. On top of that, the setting was simply beautiful and wonderfully designed. In every way the film was pure eye candy and absolutely captured the beauty of The Lion King.I also have to mention the soundtrack. The original Lion King has so many incredible songs. I am happy to say the new cast really did a great job recording the classic songs. It was hard not to smile and burst out into song while at the theater. There really was not a bad performance song wise. The entire cast perfectly replicated the magic of the original songs in their entirety.The film had an absolutely phenomenal cast, but John Oliver and Seth Rogen really stole the show. I was skeptical about Seth Rogen but he perfectly captured Pumbaa and made the character his own. John Oliver was absolutely perfect and easily delivered some of the best lines of the film. Of course as expected Donald Glover and Beyonce were all around great and James Earl Jones was iconic as ever.That all being said the film was hardly perfect. With so much of the movie being a shot for shot remake the question has to be asked why even make the film? The new songs for the film were unmemorable and I was sad to see the film change a number of iconic scenes for no reason. The movie also toned down quite a bit of the comedy and whimsical factors that made the original so mesmerizing as a youth. While the CGI was beautiful the attempt to set the film in a realistic tone really hurt what made the original so special. The character design just seemed like it had a problem emoting with the line delivery.I also really had a problem Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar. His voice never really matched the character and the changes to the song Be Prepared definitely were a step backwards. The same can be said for the entire cast of a hyenas. Some of the delivery of the lines were also a bit questionable from the young actors playing Simba and Nala.Ultimately the biggest problem with the movie was not with the film itself but with just how iconic the original Lion King was. It would be near impossible for someone like myself who grew up on The Lion King to not unfavorably compare this to the animated film. That doesn't quite seem fair however to the film as a whole.This was easily the most entertaining and well-made adaptation Disney has produced so far. For a new generation I could easily see this becoming a classic. However for those of us who grew up singing Hakuna Matata this is sure to feel like shallow and unnecessary adaptation.

A Quiet Place," Interesting premise
","I just finished seeing A Quiet Place in theaters. Wow, I must say I really enjoyed the movie. I actually had no plans to see the movie as I'm not a big fan of Jim from the Office, but the reviews were too good to pass up.The movie has a simple end of the world monster story, but the way they chose to tell it was incredibly unique. Half of the movie has no dialogue and minimal sound. This really was an effective way to enhance the element of horror and suspense.On top of that movie had quite a few genuinely terrifying moments. I found myself on the edge of my seat throughout half the movie.Despite the lack of dialogue, the movie made excellent use of sound. The sound or lack thereof, left a constant eerie feeling of dread throughout the movie that really made for a unique viewing experience.Surprisingly the movie was very well made all around. John Krasinski really did a great job writing, directing, and starring in this movie. This is the first movie I have seen him in where I was actually impressed with his acting.My only real criticism being there were a few moments that felt out of place and unrealistic. This of course did not detract from the movie though.All around this movie was a surprise in a good way. It took a very basic concept and made a unique viewing experience all around.

Call Me by Your Name," Deserves all the praise
","Just got out of the theater seeing Call Me By Your Name. Overall there was a lot to be impressed with. The film as a whole was a coming of age story dealing with love, acceptance, and loss. Anyone who has ever felt and lost love before can relate to much of the narrative of the film.Acting wise there were two standout performances. Timothée Chalamet who is the star of the film did an amazing job. He perfectly embodied the often confusing stage between adolescence and adulthood. One of the best scenes in the entire movie was him sitting in front of a fireplace quietly crying. He certainly is a talent to look forward to in the future.His father portrayed by Michael Stuhlbarg also was a standout. He had a number of excellent scenes in the film, but one in particular should have earned him a Best Supporting Oscar nomination.The relatable story and the acting where the best parts of the film. Unfortunately I did find a few problems that detracted from the film for me. The movie had some pacing issues. It did feel overly long, and some scenes could have been completely negated without impacting the film. Overall a great, but flawed film. A 8.5 out of 10.",9,2,5,1 October 2018
Coco," Best animated film of 2017
","I finally got around to seeing Coco. I must say I really enjoyed it! Coco definitely deserved all the praise it got in 2017.To start this movie is absolute pure eye candy. It is bright and festive and really captures the fantasy world it creates. It's certainly deserved to win best animated picture.Second, the music is outstanding. There were a number of songs throughout the movie I had to rewind because I wanted to listen to them over again. The song Remember Me will get stuck in your head for days! I completely understand why it was nominated and even won best original song.The story and characters were all around entertaining.
As the story progressed the movie had me laughing but also kept me engaged by it's heartwarming message.  The movie did a great job depicting a culture not normally represented in childrens Cinema. Not only did the movie portray the importance of cultural traditions it also hammered home the importance of family.I really enjoyed Coco overall. It was easily the best animated movie of the year and provided both a heartwarming and educational story. I'm glad to see Disney branch out and make movies out of their traditional comfort zone.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Much-needed Improvement
",I just got out of the new Star Wars and I am very impressed! The story felt fresh and original unlike the Force Awakens. There wasn't a single plot point I predicted was going to happen that did in fact happen. The movie also expanded on the characters and the conflict they're facing as the story progresses. It seems like we're finally getting some solid character development. I was also surprised at how very funny the movie was in some scenes.The action scenes were incredibly well choreographed. One in particular stood out as maybe the best fight scene in the history of Star Wars. There are also a few scenes in the movie that made you want to stand up and clap as a Star Wars fan.As expected the CGI and graphics were amazing. It did have a slight issue with pacing. Particularly in comparing the first half of the movie and the second half of the movie. There are also a couple plot points that seemed a tad bit too convenient. Overall one of the best Star Wars movies in years 8.5 out of 10.,8,4,18,1 October 2018
War Machine," Good, but wanted more
",Finished the movie War Machine on Netflix. It is a comedy satire of American international politics and the war in Afghanistan. The film was overall an entertaining social commentary on dysfunctional involvement with Afghanistan. Brad Pitt's dead pan deliver style worked well in this particular role. Personaly I would have trimmed off twenty or so minutes of the movie to make a tighter presentation. Giving it a 7 out of 10.,7,1,1,2 October 2018
La La Land," La La lands occasionally
","Finished rewatching La la land. After seeing it twice the elements that stands out the most are the cinematography and directing. The set design is vibrant and just fun to watch. The inclusion of magical realism also added an extra layer to the films design. The director did a great job crafting a world based around the extravagance of magical realism.Acting wise the movie was solid, I don't think best actress solid, but that is just me. Ryan Gosling was great as expected. I do think the pacing was a bit off near the halfway point. Cutting away a bit of the fat could have helped a bit. Overall a 8 out of 10.",8,0,1,2 October 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Great movie all around
","I finally watched Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. It was just what I expected, a lot of fun! The humor while juvenile at times was constantly funny. The banter between characters had me laughing the whole time. Marvel has done a great job crafting likeable characters in this franchise. You really found yourself rooting for the team throughout the movie. The soundtrack was outstanding, the song choices worked really well with most scenes. The story felt a bit predictable, but still kept me entertained. While not quite as good as part one, it still sets a high bar for the genre. A 8 out of 10 overall.",8,0,0,1 October 2018
The Shape of Water," Loved it!
","Just got out of the movie The Shape of Water. I must say this movie was not even on my radar for the year. I am completely blown away with how much I enjoyed it.The movie is kind of a retelling of the creature from the black lagoon but with a romantic dark fairytale twist thrown in. The movie is expertly directed by Guillermo del Toro who really made a beautiful film. The movie is shot in a way that feels like a haunting dream. The story is unique and truly entertaining. The setting perfectly captured the feel of 1960s America. The movie blended elements of horror, romance, drama together in a fresh manner.The acting was also outstanding. Michael Shannon truly played a terrifying villian. The main actress was also great. The movie felt completely original in its execution. I liked near everything about it. Overall a 9 out of 10.",9,3,9,1 October 2018
The Disaster Artist," James Franco surprisingly does a good job...
","Just got out of The Disaster Artist. I had no plans of watching it as I detest James Franco, but after all the fanfare I gave in. To my surprise this is actually a pretty funny movie. In the example of Ed Wood the movie follows the making of the so bad it's amazing movie The Room. Disaster Artist does a lot of things right. It tells an interesting true story and it has some genuinely funny moments. The movie also had a great ensemble cast of comedians.Franco's role with over the top and ridiculous. Normally that would be a bad thing, but the man he was portraying was also over-the-top and ridiculous. I have to say he did a good job overall. At the heart of the movie is a fun underdog story that was an enjoyable watch. A 8 out of 10.",8,2,2,1 October 2018
The Witch," Psychological masterpiece!
",Rewatched the movie The Witch. I forgot how much I enjoyed that movie. The directing and cinematography are outstanding. You really get the feeling of religious paranoia and dread from the era. The entire movie feels like one long nightmare you can't wake up from. It constantly produces a feeling of dread and paranoia that keeps you on the edge of your seat.The set design was near perfect in every way. It perfectly captured how difficult it was to live in that time period. The film also made excellent use of sound to build up moments of suspence and horror. Overall a 9 out of 10.,9,2,4,2 October 2018
Mudbound," Deserve more praise
","Just finished the new Netflix movie Mudbound. To put it simply this is one of the best movies I have seen all year. It was nominated for three Oscars, but deserves a best film nomination.The movie is a historical epic that follows the lives of a poor black family and white family in 1940s rural Mississippi. The movie deals heavily with racial discrimination, poverty, and gender inequality. The film also offers an interesting case study on ptsd through two of the families sons returning from WW2.The film had an incredible human element to it that really made you feel for the struggles of the characters. In some ways it felt like a epic Steinbeck tragedy.Acting wise the film was outstanding. Mary J Blige has been nominated for an Oscar, but the rest of the cast was equally enthralling. The movie was also beautifully shot. It deservingly so has been nominated for best cinematography. And the soundtrack which a accompanied the film was hauntingly beautiful.I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this movie. I really hope more people see this gem. It's a shame it did not have a wider theatrical launch, I would have loved to see it on the big screen. A 9 out of 10.",9,1,5,1 October 2018
Joker," A psychological case study of a man falling apart.
","So I've seen Joker at the theater twice now. I've been holding off making a review as this film just has so many spinning wheels to process. I will say, I completely understand why someone would not enjoy Joker. It's dark, disturbing, and hits way to close to home with our current social political system. That being said I love the film! I absolutely think it is a work of art and easily the best DC film to date.Anyone familiar with the joker origin story from The Killing Joke knows the Joker is an unreliable narrator. This tradition continues in this Joker origin story that is so outside the traditional genre it's hard to even call it a comic book film. Arthur Fleck is a struggling clown for hire attempting to live his dream of being a comedian. All the while he is forced to live with a rare neurological disorder that makes him laugh uncomfortably and suffers from extreme depression and anxiety. As the film unfolds we witness the slow falling apart of a man pushed to the brink of madness and what happens when society as a whole gives up on him and falls apart.Joker certainly owes quite a bit of its storytelling to Scorsese with strong themes coming from both Taxi Driver and King of Comedy. Here we examine a case study of a man feeling alienated and alone all the while examining quite a bit of social commentary on some of the darker side of our society. The film exams so many real issues like the failures in mental health, class conflict, social alienation, and the political system it's hard not to feel uncomfortable while watching a film that both reflects and distort reality to make a dark and entertaining film that will leave a lasting impression.I also have to say how much I enjoyed the overall director's choices made in the film. Despite the overall length I didn't have an issue with the pacing at all. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next as the film constantly inched the tension forward as you wait for Joker to explode. The dialogue was sharp and somehow manage to be both funny and psychologically jarring at the same time. The film had so many moments that made you want to cry with just how dark the content was, but also threw in intense scenes to add elements of horror and suspense all the while having a few genuinely laugh out loud moments.The screenwriting was so all over the place but in a absolutely fantastic way. It is hard not to compare the film to Scorsese and so many flattering ways. I must also mention how great the score was for the film. Both haunting and memorable and worked incredibly well with the gritty realistic setting of the film. On top of that the film has many moments that are open to interpretation and will leave many with a completely different viewing experience. Joker will stay with you for days at a time and is an absolutely perfect movie to try and dissect the hidden subtext of a movie that is trying to say so much about our society.With all that being said even if this film was terrible it would be a must-see entirely for Joaquin Phoenix's performance. He is an absolutely phenomenal actor and one of the best of his generation at throwing himself at a role. That being said this may be a career best. His performance was absolutely amazing and was on a level few actors can reach. Not only did he physically transform himself completely, but every aspect of his persona melted into becoming the Joker. The laugh was so perfect, but more so it was his depiction of the character's psychological trauma that really made a stunning performance. If he does not get recognition from the Oscars the system is truly broken.So I loved Joker. Still no film is perfect and Joker is no exception. Anyone looking for any semblance of a DC comic book film will be disappointed. There is almost zero mythos from the comics left intact in this film. The film could have been completely unrelated to DC and it only would have changed a few cameo appearances. On top of that while I enjoyed the pacing there were a few scenes that could have been omitted to shorten the time of the film. There is also the question of should this movie exist in the first place? It's constantly bleak and depressing that some may left feeling sickened instead of entertained. This may not be the film we need with so much darkness in our world, but it just may be the film we deserve. If you can push past the knee-jerk reaction to feel disgusted the film is truly a unique experience.Joker was my most anticipated film of the year. For me it was an utter masterpiece that demands to be seen. The film takes a refreshingly unorthodox look at the Joker character but also applies some truly stunning social commentary to make the film relevant. On top of that the acting and screenwriting were phenomenal and easily some of the best of 2019. Joker is certainly not a film for everyone. That being said it is one of my favorites for 2019 and is sure to go down as one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all time. A 9.5 out of 10.",10,1,2,26 October 2019
Kong: Skull Island," King Kong is the king of Monster Island
",Just finished the new King Kong. I wasn't really expecting much based upon the last King Kong film. Peter Jackson dropped the ball on that one. I must say though it was surprisingly a pretty good movie all around. The movie really captured everything fun about King Kong.The cgi was outstanding and the action well done. Seeing Kong beat down other giant monsters was genuinely a lot of fun. The Monster Island was very well done. I liked seeing this large mysterious Island full of crazy creatures. It really felt like a large world that I wanted to see explored.Of course seeing King Kong beat up giant monsters was the centerpiece of the movie. Kong has never looked more fierce. He was an intimidating and larger than life presence in the movie. Plus the film did a good job humanizing Kong. It was established fairly early the King Kong was the protagonist of the movie.The movie really kept me entertained the whole time. I'm looking forward to seeing future King Kong films now.

Wonder Woman," Best modern DC film
",I finally watched the new Wonder Woman movie. I must say I'm very impressed. This has to be the best DC adaptation they have made in years. The story was interesting and didn't feel cliche at all. The action was all well choreographed and felt very organic. I really love the character interaction in the film as well. The film really brought to heart what Wonder Woman represented for DC Comics. A great ride overall 9 out of 10.,9,29,60,1 October 2018
Black Panther," Wakanda forever!
","Just finished seeing The Black Panther at the theater. I must say I am very impressed. Marvel really crafted an interesting world in Black Panther full of fascinating characters.The best aspect of the film is easily the world building. Black Panther crafted the Wakanda world with such detail it was breath taking. The movie really went above and beyond shaping a unique and engaging culture for their world scape. Acting wise the movie was packed to the brim with talent. There really wasn't a bad performance in the movie. I particularly enjoyed Danai Gurira who was bad ass as always. The acting was only enhanced by the fact the characters were all well written. Both Killmonger and Klaw were interesting and engaging villains in their own way. Killmonger in particular was a standout in the Marvel Universe for an interesting villain. It was also great to see Andy Serkis in person for a change. Animation wise the movie was gorgeous. There was a lot of pure eye candy in this film. On top of that the choreography for the fight scenes was outstanding. The final large all out battle was particularly satisfying. who doesn't love seeing someone riding rhino into battle?Whoever made the soundtrack also did a great job. Sound was a big part of this movie and directly tied into a lot of scenes. The music really helped to immerse you into the Black Panther World.I did feel the movie was a bit uneven though. The movie had a very strong opening and ending, but the middle was a bit weak. You could easily predict what was going to happen mid-way through the movie. That didn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie, but I would have preferred to see a tighter script.Overall this is one of the most original and interesting Marvel movies to date. Despite its minor flaws it was a great ride from start to finish. A 8.25 out of 10.",8,0,1,1 October 2018
Mother!," Wow powerful film!
","I just got out of the film mother I must say I am blown away. The film is an allegorical masterpice. Every scene has a deeper underlying meaning. The acting was excellent all around. Jennifer Lawrence really showed her range. The directing was masterfully done on every level. I really want to go back and watch the film again. That all being said this film is not for everyone. It is going to be a polarizing film with critics and audiences. There are some scenes that are beautiful and poetic, while others are violent and disturbing. If you love it or hate it, this movie will leave you thinking. For me it is a 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,2 October 2018
The Greatest Showman," Eh not the most memorable film
","So I finally watched Greatest Showman last night. I've been putting it off as I was immensely underwhelmed by the early reviews. Overall I think my suspicions were right in this is a very average movie.I'll start by saying I love musicals, so this is in no way an attack against all musicals. Greatest Showman as a whole just was not a very good musical. Yes there were some immensely talented performers. And yes there were one or two really good songs, but the rest were very lackluster. Most of the performances were just completely forgettable. I really wasn't a fan of the story of the movie either. Hugh Jackman did his best but PT Barnum was just not a sympathetic protagonist. I really found myself not liking the character as the film went along.Singing wise Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron did a solid job all around. Those two men are great actors and it's easy to forget that they are also excellent musicians. Unfortunately neither were working with the greatest material.I really think in a more skilled directors hands this could have been a better movie. As it stands it is a relatively forgettable lighthearted popcorn flick. A 6.5 out of 10.",6,2,3,1 October 2018
Life," Aliens but not as good....
","Finished the new alien thriller Life. Thanks Tom Wolfarth for the recommendation. The film did a good job utilizing sound to build up tension and suspence. There were a few genuinely well done horror sequences throughout the Unfortunately there wasn't a single original idea in the whole movie. The cast was good, everyone did their job, but no one really stood out. I expected a bit more acting wise from Jake Gyllenhaal really. It's not the casts fault that the material was lacking. An actor can only do so much if the material is not there.I will say that the pacing was fast paced and kept you on your feet. It was an entertaining movie in general, but ultimately very average and forgettable.Unfortunately the story did feel a bit unoriginal in many aspects and that just hurt the movie all around. Overall a average film that didn't try hard enough. 6.25 out of 10.",6,1,2,2 October 2018
Green Book," Incredibly well acted comedy/drama that touches on the complexity of institutional and cultural discrimination.
","So I saw Green Book at the theater. Of course I was excited to see the movie based upon the incredible cast. I'm always hesitant around Oscar season because it seems there is normally at least one film that gets far more praise than it deserves. I'm happy to say Green Book was certainly not that film. It all around was a great film that covers a wide variety of complex issues while providing a crowd-pleasing experience for all.The premise of the movie follows the true story of the talented and stoic musician Doc Shirley and his talkative blue-collar driver/ bodyguard Tony Lip as they go on a music tour of the Deep South. Both men are presented to be polar opposites and hold false perceptions towards each other. Of course along the way the two men realize the perceived differences between them are not so wide and a budding friendship blooms. The film covers a wide variety of topics related to social class, cultural norms, segregation, racism, substance abuse, and sexuality. The film manages to fit all these topics nicely into a well rounded and entertaining buddy comedy drama that will leave you smiling.Of course the film also acts as a backdrop to demonstrate the historical setting of the Jim Crow South and race relations as a whole from that era. There are number of times throughout the film where they illustrate the harsh realities of discrimination and prejudice faced against black individuals due to racism. Of course the film also takes it's social commentary a step further by looking at class differences that exist between individuals and just how those also create different life chances and cultural norms.The film did capture a lot of the racial and ethnic tension felt from that era. Racism did not exist only in the south and the film illustrated that racial prejudice exists along many cultural avenues. The film asks questions about an individual's identity and just how much race plays into a person's concept of self. The film also demonstrates the harsh realities of stereotyping and just how all these cultural ideas are harmful particularly in regard to race.Of course what makes this movie really special is its acting. Mahershala Ali sure knows how to pick a role. He brought such a complexity to the character. You really felt for his struggle and pain as he dealt with issues regarding racism and his own identity. His range as an actor allowed him to convincingly play the role of a complex and compelling character.Viggo Mortensen was outstanding as expected. He has a way of transforming himself directly into the character. Not only did he put on quite a bit of weight for the role but he perfectly captured the mannerisms and colloquial manners of speech aswell. A less-talented actor could not have played the role and transformed the character into a likeable protagonist. I would not be surprised at all if both get nominated for Oscars for their performance. The movie it is worth watching entirely for their performances alone.Directing wise there was nothing wrong with the film. The film was very dialogue-driven, but again the performances by the actor's made the film quite entertaining. Despite its length I didn't see any issue with pacing and I really didn't have any issues with unnecessary plot points. The score of the film was also quite impressive.Now as far as negatives of the film there were a few points that could have been improved upon. Viggo Mortensen's character starts the film off with a display of his racial bias, but it never really goes anywhere. The film wants us to like its main character a little bit too much so we don't see the darker side of his prejudice. The film also had an opportunity to make more of a statement regarding the Jim Crow South. While it did have a number of examples of institutional and cultural discrimination, it only really scratched the surface of the racial tension of that era. Ultimately the film wanted to play more into the light-hearted comedy drama angle than a serious commentary on racial prejudice.I thoroughly enjoyed Green Book. It was easily one of the most entertaining movies of 2018. The film had an interesting and compelling story that was grounded in incredible acting and solid directing. There are multiple moments throughout the film that will leave you laughing and cheering at the buddy morality tale about friendship and compassion. The film did lose a few points for playing it safe in regard to racial tensions, but that just wasn't the movie it was trying to make. It's hard to fault a film when it wasn't trying to make a gritty serious drama. A 9.25 out of 10.",9,3,6,13 December 2018
Annihilation," Natalie Portman does not disappoint
","So I just finished seeing Annihilation in theaters. I walked into this knowing nothing about this movie. it's rare that I see a film without doing copious amounts of research on it first, but a friend strongly recommended it. I must say I'm immensely impressed.Annihilation falls into a weird category of movie that encompasses elements of a sci-fi thriller, horror, philosophical drama, and a odd acid trip. The initial setup of the movie is relatively simple. A woman goes on a mission to investigate a mysterious area in an attempt to help her sick husband, from there all hell breaks loose.I love the way the movie Incorporated so much in its run time. The Sci-Fi elements felt fresh and original, taking a unique spin on a recycled concept. The horror elements at times remind me of John Carpenter's The Thing. Brutal and horrifying at the same time, but very well done.The setting of the movie reminded me of a haunting dream. It had moments of absolute beauty and intrigue, while other times morphing into a twisted nightmare. Acting wise the movie was well done all around. Natalie Portman was a outstanding protagonist. The entire cast was packed with strong female leads. There really wasn't a bad performance.The movie was written and directed by Alex Garland who is known for writing 28 Days Later and directing ex machina. So of course with Annihilation there were huge philosophical implications. The movie brought up interesting ideas regarding the nature of humanity, evolution, and the concept of self. It asked quite a number of very intriguing questions. It is definitely a movie that will leave you thinking on many levels.I really enjoyed this movie, but it is not without its flaws. The ending is very open ended and Incredibly ambiguous. At times the movie brings up more questions than it answers. The movie may not be perfect but it was a hell of a ride a 8.25 out of 10.",8,2,4,1 October 2018
Sully," Sully
",Finished the movie Sully. Tom Hanks can play any role. He did an outstanding job with the role. The directing was very well done. My only criticism being they could have added a bit more depth to the characters. Still a really good movie 8 out of 10.,8,1,1,2 October 2018
Alien: Covenant," Let down after Prometheus!
","I finally finished Alien Covenant. Overall I'm a bit disappointed in it. All of the suspense and thrills of the original are gone. Plus the mystery and Intrigue as a continuation of Prometheus are abandoned. The animation was excellent and the film was entertaining. It wasn't a bad film, it just wasn't the film I wanted. 7 out of 10.",7,2,3,2 October 2018
