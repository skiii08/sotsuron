Vertigo," vertigo
","The beginning of the subtitle animation is good, thought it was a computer screensaver screen, turn ah turn ah, the evolution of the Milky Way.
The hero of the detective is training himself to overcome his fear of heights, step by step, then the lovely white soft down, collapsed on the woman.
His classmate Gavin sent him after his wife. The wife's great-grandmother had been abandoned. Was her illness due to genetic predisposition? Or a ghost? Or did she subconsciously play the role of the outcast, saying or doing something, looking at a picture of her great-grandmother and dressing up as that person? The wife had a bad relationship with her husband and felt abandoned.
The character of the detective is very like 007, with deep eyes, but with a certain age. He's driving behind a woman with a flat camera. The silver-white car seems long, perhaps because of the wide screen.
Female trance and 'fifth avenue' have a ratio.
The woman has been looking into the distance while kissing the detective, the original Riga in the murder of his wife.
The detective who falls in love with 'Gavin's wife' has a nightmare after his suicide by jumping from the church tower. The background was changing red and green, and he felt like a falling piece of paper. Later, when he was admitted to a mental hospital, the woman who liked him had, in a funny way, changed the picture of the woman into her own face, this time telling the doctor, 'Mozart may not be of any use to him.'
Later he leaves the hospital, in order to find out the truth forced the wife to go to the top of the church tower again, after all the explanation she was surprised by the sudden arrival of the old bell-ringing nun fell from the building.
It is hard to say that the detective fell in love with the 'false wife'.
In the process of watching the old feel almost over, did not expect to have content.",8,0,0,21 April 2020
Come and See," The division of the war collective
","I was afraid to watch Russian or Soviet literature and art, and afraid to watch war movies, 'see it yourself' is both, but under the influence of ni ke can not hold back to see it. Still saw, from yesterday afternoon to the evening, the film also more than two hours of length, but felt under too much pressure, in the interval for several hours to continue to see the end.
It's a film I hope humans won't be able to make (because there's no reference), although it's undeniably a stunning masterpiece.
The film is set in white Russia in 1943, two years after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet union, during which it is self-evident that many brutal battles took place, but the camera avoids the battlefield where the two sides are directly depicted, and follows closely a boy who joins the army.
Young floriola with partners in the ruins of the war in the gun, with a gun, he can join the guerrillas. He got his wish, bid farewell to his mother and a pair of naive and lovely twin sisters, was disguised as the German guerrillas away.
In the froyola home, the mother received the two soldiers who had come to take her son with a mixture of fear, anxiety, and a vague hatred. When one of them, a large, jargon-prone, stiff-faced soldier, tried to amuse his two younger sisters, the children were terrified and on the verge of tears. This is in stark contrast to the scene when the mother angrily thrust the axe into her brother's hand, threatening to have him chop them to death before leaving the house. Despite attempts to be kind and reassuring, even the casual children felt strange and nervous in the two adults who had gone to war, an aura that was hard to blend with their daily lives.
The film quietly reinforces this sense of separation again and again, arouses emotions with the stimulation of subjective feelings, and gradually immerses the viewer's mental state into the historical scene it is to shape. Although it's realistic, it's actually full and subtle in its use of techniques to create a presence of 'body,' as the title suggests, 'see for yourself.'
I noticed the following:
By visual drop. Such as the conversion of normal and dull tones. The first hint of this change comes at the beginning of the film, when froglia digs into a gun against a backdrop of green grass and blue sky, but then the fighter jets streak across a gray sky, and from a bird 's-eye view, the grass and trees become a gray blur.
Through the auditory drop. Such as high and low roar, from machinery (planes, motorcycles, etc.), from animals (flies, etc.) or disturbed radio waves, even physical tinnitus. The monotonous repetition of the sound made people anxious and depressed; There was the interlacing of the true and the disguised intonations -- the children who had come before froriola, speaking in a disconcerting, aged and fierce voice. Then we heard the truth of his voice again, and above all the childish words of concern to his companion: 'what's the matter? Peeing your pants?' This seemed to confirm his real age. But even as I felt compassion for the child, I was still terrified: for the voice of the old man was beyond the range of what I could understand a child to disguise, and there was an inescapable truth in it.
As the film progresses, the signs of aging that end up on fryola's face again echo those of the well-spoken child, who is a shape-shifting sensor, spokesman and victim of the powerful violence.
Then there is the expression, the behavior, the emotional reaction, let me feel the most creepy is this. Laugh, laugh desperately, twist a cry face and still smile! Floriola and graca meet, sadness, fear, despair... There is a lot of unbearably negative emotion hidden in the neurotic dialogue, and yet they tacitly communicate with laughter and bantering. Floriola home in the emotional description of the repression to the extreme, but people can not use the word of pity or compassion to isolate themselves, to comment on it. I can only pause, pull away, and let myself think of something else. It turned out that the psychological interpretation of froriola's actions was a profound portrayal of the grief response:
1. The denial. When fryola entered the village, he felt something was wrong, but he did not want to face up to his prediction. He entered the house, ignored the whizzing of flies from the rotten food (his voice was deliberately exaggerated), and brought out the milk that had gone bad for too long to feed graca. 'It's still warm,' he insisted. This assumes that mom and sister have been away for a short time and that everything is fine;
2. The suspect. Graca found the village head was massacred and hysterical, but froriola did not look, excitedly dragged graca into the swamp. He assumes that his family has survived their hiding on the island, but as he struggles through the mud, his flustered steps reveal the question he asks himself -- is it really all the same? Whether misfortune has befallen;
3. The anger. Arriving on the island, graca shouted the fact that his family had been massacred, and floriola attacked, strangling her and pushing her into the swamp. Still, he does not accept the reality of death, but the irrationality of this moment allows him to vent his anger towards death on his closest companions (in fact, the self-attack is directed at graca, who becomes the self-embodiment of froriola's acceptance of the reality of death).
4. Guilt. In the refuge of the island, the severely burned uncle deliriously blames fryola for digging up the guns. Although we know this is not true, fryola is also immersed in such remorse, which is mixed with the guilt of abandoning his family to join the army. He burrowed his head into the mud. When he followed the adults in search of food, the women asked him, 'don't leave us, child.' A mother with a baby in her arms consoled him: 'you never knew it would turn out like this. You never knew.' 'No, it's all my fault.'
The rough fate of floriola did not end there, foraging on the road with four people, finally left him. Rescued by an old man, he is hidden away in the village in his new identity, and the old man's rambling introduction to his family seems to ease the atmosphere, even with a touch of fantasy -- will froriola fit in with his new family? But then came the Nazi massacre.
In one detail, fryola is left behind by the army, crushing a nest of birds' eggs as he runs. This is probably the dividing line, and since then, the teenager's face has often developed the expression that trauma sufferers have. Two more photographs, one with the guerrillas, when he was a normal boy; The second time, he was photographed with a pistol held to his head by the nazis.
In the pull off state, we can say in theory that the child needs psychological intervention. But the truth is, we're watching, we're watching, we're not doing anything about it. As for myself, I can only chills and pray that I shall never be in such an environment as long as I live.
The unity and separation of emotions is an important criterion for judging schizophrenia, so we see it as abnormal when an individual's behavior and emotional response to a specific situation does not conform to our expectations. But what if the environment itself is abnormal? Every moment in the face of deprivation, the loss of loved ones, the threat of life, bad luck hovering over the head but do not know whether the next second will come... So what can we rely on? There is no such thing as normal order, that is, the collective schizophrenia, no one is immune.
The germans drove and beat the villagers to cheerful music and playful propaganda and burned them in wooden houses. Throw a baby back to the window of death like an inanimate muppet, or like a young pioneer doing a good deed, carry an old granny to her bed out of the burning place... The grotesque behavior reveals that the victorious side is also seized by fear, though not until after the exile.
I didn't like the silence of the guerrillas and the villagers at the end, watching scornfully the spectacle of the defeated side, the last volley of fire ending them, the fire thrown into the water. It seems to emphasize the moral nobility of the just side. It would be better if they acted impulsively, or even violently in return. Nico thought it was a good deal. She thought it was not that they didn't want revenge, but that they had a deep fear of the violence. Also, the maker of fear will eventually be swallowed up by fear. But why is it that humans are endlessly involved?
This film makes me strongly feel the power of art, which can not only be used to satisfy aesthetic pleasure, or passively become some kind of desire object; When it is full of energy and tends to perfect, it has a breathtaking attraction, can actively grab and capture the viewer, accurately and impressively instill its idea. It is, so to speak, both a danger and the best warning of it",8,0,0,1 May 2020
Scarface," Break through
","I've always liked these films about Vietnam, Cuba and Burma. Even though scarface only mentions Cuba at the beginning, I'm still fascinated by the background, and the movie is also very long, it's over 170 minutes long, and after watching it, I think the ink is a lot like oliver stone, the ink, but the ink is interesting. Trivia and director interview, it was oliver. Stone writers, and it is when he was the most unappreciated, almost bankrupt become box office poison, depressed under the adaptation of the script, change after ya is very want to personally guide, but the management and the producer said what also dare not to him, but found a director of great box-office appeal -- -- -- -- -- you know, remaking old piece of how risky, but still so deeply rooted in a classic black and white, how difficult also, want to break through the difficulty is roughly equivalent to remake the 83 version of the legend of the condor heroes.I didn't see the old version of scarface, I just saw a few bits of it in the sideshow. It was a classic. There was a scene of picking up a girl, which many movies have copied.Female: 'he is your boss'
Man: 'I'm only interested in you right now.'I think when AL Pacino was young, he was very skilled in his performance, and it was a big breakthrough just because of the length and the spectacle.Behind every boss has a remarkable woman, the woman looks like eat soft rice, what matter son who actually, this woman is the most terrible, in 'once upon a time in America, we see how wheat, phase the coquettish beauty between the adept with their elder brother a few, and how to live to the end of the safe and sights. The rest of the people are all muddle-headed flapping street, she is still clear to understand alive, alive to tell the story of the magnificent brotherhood, the romantic love story.In this movie, too, scarface steals the boss's woman, who then walks away from him, leaving him to pounced on his gun-riddled luxury home.American movies, often intentionally or unintentionally reflect on their national pride themselves on the 'American Dream' () of an American Dream, to outsiders is very beautiful very reasonable national traits, they repeated reflection, from Fitzgerald's novel to many many Hollywood movies, is to reflect on the question: a tycoon by tramp through their own efforts, a by our own wisdom become the mainstream of society, an implementation of a legendary American Dream, he, will, happiness? Should not, get happiness?In fact, we have already seen that the sad gatsby, who has never been confident all his life, is unhappy, and the great citizen Kane, who is still living a more empty and lonely life, can't even get to the end of his life on scarface, a Cuban stowaway.This kind of self-reflection and self-deprecation has always sold well and made people feel sorry for themselves, but never has an American declared that his values are being challenged, and that in the face of strong destiny and complex humanity, people should always be humble and low-key. And raise the importance of the self-deprecating spirit to the level of introspection!",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Howl's Moving Castle," Love + courage=magic
","Love at first sight and love slowlyIt was clear that Sophie had fallen in love with Hal at first sight: from the time he put his arm around her to rescue her, to the time he took her for a walk in the air, to the time she talked absentmindedly to her sister, to the time she drove home and stared into the distance, it was a sign that she was secretly in love with Hal. In fact, for the life of the ordinary Sophie, how to refuse the magnificent as a prince Hal? (smile)On the other hand, Hal's good looks are definitely not lacking for girls, but it is Sophie who can finally understand Hal's weakness and give him courage and support. So Sophie gradually wins Hal's love in her relationship with him.2. Sophie's transformationFor Sophie, who had been dressing in grey and blue for years and making hats in front of the window, duty and obedience were the themes of her life, a life that hid her inner glory and made her live like a grey mouse, looking in the mirror and desponding even herself.The situation is broken when Sophie is turned into a 90-year-old woman by the badlands witch. Because Sophie could no longer stay in the hat shop, she finally had a reason to escape from the arrangement of life. Sophie said: the good thing about being old is that you have nothing to fear and nothing to worry about losing.
I prefer Sophie as she grows older, because Sophie's mother-in-law is lovely, has a personality, aggressive, and compassionate.In one scene, Hal throws a tantrum over dyeing his hair. 'what's the point of being alive if you're not pretty,' he says. Sophie was angry: I've never been pretty! Then he went out the door and cried. It's an amazing transformation: as soon as Sophie becomes a mother-in-law, her previously repressed inner feelings begin to release and her bright spots come out.The opposite loverSophie represents the person who has no outward appearance but an inner abundance. (a mother-in-law's appearance is bad enough, but the clean crazy witch is actually pretty cute.) Hal, on the other hand, represents a man who looks gorgeous but feels empty and timid. It was dramatic that the two men fell in love.Love is growing up togetherSophie and Hal turned out to be evasive people. Hal avoids facing his inner weakness, while Sophie avoids fighting for her right to live. The witch's persecution of the wasteland brought them together and gave them courage and hope for love. Finally, Sophie no longer felt inferior, and Hal no longer covered his heart with vanity.5, magic,Miyazaki hayao like magic, as big friends keyang like machinery. The person who loves magic represents a state of being: a strong desire to achieve the dream of the heart. Because magic means strong faith. And love is the catalyst to activate this belief.6. The world is oneIn the original, the conflict between people is obvious, and the wasteland witch finally gets the destruction. And in the movie, there are no really hateful characters. Saliman, the wasteland witch, as the villain, also has a kind and lovely place. This shows that miyazaki hayao's world view is getting wider and wider. There is no absolute good or bad in the world.Hal's moving castle is easy in general. And plain truth is always in simplicity. I think miyazaki has returned to his roots. Life, itself is used to romance.",9,0,0,3 May 2020

Raiders of the Lost Ark," Subject background analysis
","'
I have come to see this film with reverence, both for films made before I was born and for the subject matter.
I won't say much about filmmaking, the acting, the special effects, the structure, the sound, etc., which was more than expected in those days. I on the background environment 81 my opinion!
First of all, starting from the selection of the film, the United States is a Christian country, more than 90% of the people are christians, 'ark of the covenant' is a Christian holy things, any difference of views on the Christian holy things is very fatal, so the film is very risky to choose this theme. Of course, this also determines the specific location of the film, the specific shape.
The ark of the covenant was made by Moses at the direction of god when he received his version of the ten commandments on mount sinai (ps: a metaphor for zion in the matrix) when he came out of Egypt. The Hebrews were convinced that the ark was a symbol of god's almighty power, and they received guidance and wisdom from it. At the same time, god's power will manifest itself through the ark. Almost all biblical accounts of the ark depict it as a weapon of war. In the battle of Jericho, the Hebrews carried the ark of the covenant and blew the trumpets. In this way, the 'efficacy' of the 'ark of the covenant' also determines the historical background of the film. Fasthis seeks for the 'meaning' of the ark, hoping to win the war through the power of the ark.
The ark was sacred to the israelites, and no one was allowed to touch it. According to the bible, someone was killed by lightning for touching the ark of the covenant. Even a look is burned by the flame, indy says at the end of the film: 'don't look. Keep your eye shut!' So that determines what the final plot and special effects are going to look like.
The bible has a detailed description of the ark :(quote)
'Make the tabernacle and all its furnishings according to the pattern I will show you.
Exod 25:10 'you shall make a chest of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit and a half high.
'You shall overlay it with pure gold and make a gold molding around it.
'You shall also cast four gold rings and put them on its four feet, two rings on this side and two rings on that side.
'You shall make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
'You shall put the poles in the rings beside the ark to carry it.
'The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be drawn out.
'You shall put in the ark the testimony which I am about to give you.
'You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
'Then you shall make two cherubim (angels) of hammered gold at the two ends of the mercy seat.
Make one cherub on one end and one cherub on the other end; of one piece shall the cherubims be of the mercy seat at its two ends.
Then the cherubim shall spread their wings over the mercy seat. And the cherubim shall face to face, toward the mercy seat.
'You shall put the atonement cover on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony which I will give you.
This determines that the ark of the covenant in the film must be made in accordance with such 'ark' props.
It is also a lot of people think the indy films will be found in Egypt's 'ark', I want to put forward my opinion, there is a folk statement has never been confirmed: it is said that the temple of Babylon invaded, plunder, the ark was smuggled out of Jerusalem, by the king Solomon, the son of memmel nico risked their lives to secure transfer. Melenico took the ark with him to Ethiopia, where he stayed in the land of his mother, the queen of sheba.
There is also the claim that the babylonian invasion of Jerusalem was a booty, which is not true because in 586 BC the babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar ii attacked Jerusalem, destroyed the temple and enslaved the Hebrews. However, there is no mention of the ark among all the booty listed in the bible that the babylonians brought back to earth, a hint that it had disappeared by then. (but that's not to say it's impossible to find clues in the loot.)
It says in the movie that Egypt took the ark of the covenant from the temple of Solomon when they invaded Jerusalem. At this point I would like to make my point: the ark disappeared long before the Egyptian invasion of Jerusalem, 1000 years ago. In the time of king Solomon of Israel no power could invade Jerusalem. So the old folklore story is more reliable, and it's a pity that Steven spielberg didn't take it.
Oh, I just put forward my opinion, hope someone can correct the mistake. Expect more people to study it.

Chinatown," isn't everyone
","Almost everyone in China who has seen CHINATOWN has at least one question on their mind: why call it CHINATOWN and what does it have to do with it?It doesn't matter. The story takes place in LA in the 1930s and 1940s. JAKE, a former police officer, experiences extraordinary things in Chinatown, which makes him have unbearable memories, reasons for leaving to become a private detective and a cynical character. At the end of the story, he returns to Chinatown, where JAKE experiences similar pain again. So on the surface of the story it does matter.As you can imagine, JAKE was as inquisitive, conscientious and compassionate as he is now as a private detective. Try your best to help those in need, but when he was in Chinatown, his supervisor told him, 'As little As possible.' Because he would not do so, he tried to help some people, but in the end he could not avoid the fact that these people were hurt or died. And the reality still came round and round - the black forces, the powerful forces behind the eradication of the opposition, to protect their own interests, Chinatown is still tang street. JAKE thought there would be a cleaner sky when he left Chinatown, but in the end he was still covered by the cloud over Chinatown. There was no clean place, and he followed the same rules as in Chinatown. Finally, as he watches the woman he wants to protect die in the car, a morbid JAKE hears a cop say, 'Forget it, JAKE, it's Chinatown.' Perhaps he understood. But where does he go from here? No answer.Tragic endingThe heroine dies in the car, shot in the eye, IMDB said, a metaphor for Greek mythology, and then presses her head on the steering wheel, making a horn sound, which was seen in a previous SCENE. When the heroine Mrs. Mo leaves her daughter/sister's room, just get in the car, JAKE is also in the car, to ask her the truth, this is Mrs. Mo's head is a little despair on the steering wheel, horn suddenly sounded at this time...The futureAsk JAKE behind, is also The father of The heroine 'you have a lot of money, have no what you can't buy, why did you do it (part of water project, kill people)' The old man a meaningful said 'The future of The future' for him, know time is not much, also with my daughter for The child, and killed her husband rob water control of stockpiled The appreciation of land, in order to 'future' is all this? Whose future? Is it the future of LA? The movie may not give a clear answer.Kiding?JAKE starts off as cynical and funny. His series of jokes gradually become 'puns' as the plot deepens, and they have a deep meaning behind them.The police found JAKE's phone number on the kitchen wall of the fake Mrs. MOE's house and accused him of being involved. 'isn't that your phone number?' they asked. JAKE says breezily, 'really? I don't remember if it was my number, and I don't call myself very often.'JAKE goes to the office of the deputy director of water. The director says, 'after working with someone for a long time, I will know his hobbies, etc., and whether he is a philandel or not.' JAKE raises his eyelids and asks, 'is Mr. Namo a philandel?' The chief says, 'he doesn't even joke about it.' JAKE says, 'oh, maybe he's serious about it.'One of the most interesting jokes I found was when the fake Mrs. MOE called JAKE in his office, wanting to tell him something, but worried about the number of people waiting, and asked, 'Are you alone?' JAKE immediately interjected, 'Isn't everyone?'Yes, Isn't everyone?",8,0,0,8 May 2020

Citizen Kane," Break through
","The whole story began with 'rosebud,' Kane's last words before he died. Reporter Thompson uncovers Kane's life by interviewing people who can explain 'rosebud.' At the end of citizen Kane, when the sled with the words 'rosebud' burns up, the audience seems to understand the meaning of rosebud vaguely, a kind of lost happiness? A simple regret? Or a lonely ending? And it seems that the audience can't understand the true meaning of 'rosebud' after all? ...
However, it is the unknown meaning of 'rosebud' that leads to the meaning of citizen Kane itself.From form to structure, citizen Kane boldly breaks through the original Hollywood classic narrative mode.
At the beginning of the film, there is Kane's mansion and gate, with the words 'no admittance', accompanied by the big and scary music, like leading the audience into a mystery or detective film; In the following scene, the character Kane is introduced like a news documentary; When journalists talk about 'rosebud' and Thompson begins to investigate Kane's life, it's like a biopic; In those montage scenes where Susan sings the opera, the audience seems to see the way the musical is done... It can be seen from this that we can't frame this movie with the classic Hollywood genre at all. It USES the elements of many types of Hollywood movies and completely blurs the Hollywood model from the genre at first.
Hollywood's classic narrative emphasizes the objectification of the story and presents a basically objective story. The film shows Kane's life in five large flashbacks. In investigation and Thompson Kane lives two lines of puncture, Thompson respectively from Bernstein cut the son, and his manager and his good friend, and his second wife, Susan and the servant Raymond know there for Kane's childhood and his career, his private life (marriage) for the first time, he of the middle-aged and old age, and so on. Kane's life is connected in the narration of each different narrator, which is highly subjective. In many scenes, the director also violates the time order to arrange the plot. This film breaks the previous linear narrative mode of film order, and adopts multiple narrative structure, flexibly USES flashbacks and flashbacks, and breaks through the single point of view of the narrative, instead, it presents Kane from multiple perspectives.
The classic Hollywood model stresses a closed ending, that is, the story begins with conflict and ends with problem solving, which is a dramatic story structure. In this film, the audience cannot see the ending at all, or rather, the ending that the audience sees is only an open ending. That is to say, there are conflicts but not resolved, put forward questions but not resolved. In the enigma of 'rosebud,' the audience gets a lot of thinking and imagination. Thompson ends by saying that 'there is no word that can explain Kane's life,' leaving the film's ending ambiguous and ambiguous, a complete break from the clear Hollywood ending. With the open approach, the audience does not have to forcibly accept the director's intention, but has their own space to feel. In this, perhaps, is the biggest rebellion against the classic Hollywood model.
In the classic model of Hollywood, the focus is on creating the stereotyped, flat characters. In the film, Kane's character also seems unclear. Of course, because of the film's multiple perspectives, in addition to being able to face the scene before Kane's death, at other times, Kane is either in the newsreel or in other people's memories. The five narrators, setcher, Bernstein, ryland, Susan, and Raymond, each present a side of Kane that is complex and multifaceted. The character image of Kane has become more three-dimensional and vivid in the words of different characters, and also has a speculative color. Bernstein recalls Kane in a sympathetic and emotional way, and ryland talks about his relationship with Kane in a cynical way... All of this brings with it the subjectivity of the perspective, and the argument from these perspectives does not fully account for Kane's true character. The film just shows a complex character and the social relationship of the character, etc., but it does not break the theme and character like the previous classic mode, making the film more imaginative and exploratory. In classic Hollywood, often shaped are some spiritual love with material wealth and have the perfect figure, and the film just describes how Kane from a idealistic, young ignorant young man into a no friendship without love recluse such a process, a kind of life, has clearly run counter to the Hollywood shape character pattern.
In addition to the story structure and the theme of the characters, the film has made a bold breakthrough in the Hollywood model, as well as a new attempt in the film shooting technique.
For example, the film created and used a large number of depth of field shots, making the picture in the depth of more changes and scheduling, greatly enhance the spatial tension of the film. These interesting depth-of-field shots make the audience's vision more realistic and require the audience to think more actively and even participate in the scene scheduling. Such as in the show Kane's mother and tucked the long Chelsea has signed the contract, the original looks like a small Kane's panoramic camera, but the camera back, out of a window, and then the Kane's mother, continue to pull back, Kane's mother and son sat in the outlook of cutting table to sign the contract, Kane's father stood in the left of the picture, () in the depths of the scene outside the window the little Cain is play with snow in the snow. This long shot is enough to show the director's unique way of bringing the complexity of the plot into the picture at the same time. In a classic Hollywood narrative, the passage would have been handled with a straight up, down, continuous montage. This is the use of deep space scene scheduling to complete the picture expression. This kind of long shot fully reflects the characteristics of the film, reproduces the unified film space and time, more expressive than the general editing program.
The film also used a large number of low Angle shooting lens, so that the picture has a very unique meaning. The biggest Angle of this film is shot in the most unsuccessful time of kaine's life, that is, he lost the election for governor. The camera is low to the ground, and the ceiling is visible, greatly highlighting this space. In such a scene, not only reproduce the reality of the scene, more importantly, create a very depressed atmosphere, but also hint at the failure of the giant, hint of Kane from a successful to a lonely transition.
In the editing of some special scenes, the film is also unique. In the case of Kane and Emily's marriage, for example, the film's extremely brief and clever montage shows. The passage USES several short snippets to trace briefly the failure of Kane's first marriage. Just a few montage of breakfast scenes, from the characters' lines, expressions, makeup, etc., show their progress from intimacy to hostility.The stylized narrative, dramatic structural principles, stereotyped character sets, single objective viewpoints, and smooth, continuous editing of previous Hollywood classics have been completely broken in citizen Kane. The narrative discourse of film has a new expression and breakthrough in citizen Kane, which has a great influence on more modern and diversified films in the future.
The 'rosebud' puzzle is now open to everyone's opinion, but it's safe to say that 'rosebud' opens a new era of modern cinema, which rejects the aesthetic principles of previous films",5,0,2,22 April 2020

","The director created a 'fragmented' atmosphere in an unprecedented reverse order, letting the audience deeply experience Lenny's broken life and innerness. We act like detectives like Lenny, looking for the so-called truth in the movie. And the emotion woven in the complex structure makes people unable to be moved. 'If self-deception can make me happy, I choose to live so.' We must give ourselves a reason to survive, otherwise we will be schizophrenic. But those things we insist on may only be illusions in our own illusions. When I woke up, I looked at the ceiling and asked myself: Who am I and why am I here.

Amberson is at loggerheads with the macho male aesthetic of western culture, but he has a more sensitive understanding of words, language and poetry than other men. Alex likes to create characters who are often not valued by people and do not look so outstanding, and it can be seen that he works hard to express amberson's rich inner activities.

Finding Nemo," Father's love is like a mountain.
","People say that fatherly love is like a mountain, and fatherly love is deep. That 's right.The father of the clownfish in the movie did things carefully and was laughed at by others as a coward. Fatherly love is great, when the child runs away from home and is captured and sold to the city. His father, who usually seemed timid as a rat, embarked on the path of finding children. On the way, he met a forgetful Dory, avoiding the big sharks on the road, and did not give up in many cases. Yes, in order to save his child, the clownfish father seems to inspire the body's potential, and pursues courage all the way.
As the saying goes, raising a child is 100 years old and often worry about 99. The clownfish father is the same. As long as he is still alive and can move, he will find his son.

The Great Dictator," A thirst for freedom
","World Film History: This is one of Chaplin 's most successful films, directed and directed by him. The film portrays the brutal persecution of the Jewish dictator Henkel, the tycoon who tried to rule the world. Kerr implied that Nazi leader Hitler, Chaplin imitated Hitler very clearly in the shape of the character, and cleverly mocked and scolded him through personal speeches.
The hatred of dictatorship lies in the desire for freedom, and the logical contradiction of the dictator is that he knows that he cannot be in power forever, but insists on immersing himself in the illusion of making an empire. This is the illusion provided by greed, ambition, and desire to control, because they are also illusions. Farass: Which is Chaplin playing Hitler?

My Neighbor Totoro," Rods
","'Open your hands, I am the wind, dreams are the most different time and space in the world.' 'As long as there are Doudou dragons in everyone's heart, childhood will never disappear, and love is the most beautiful possession.' These originally touched me The lyrics still have this charm. The foolish attachment of Houhou seemed to be back in my body, which delighted me.The two little girls are really cute, Xiaoyue is the elder sister, and Xiaomei is the younger sister. They are lively and cheerful, and they all have the enviable childhood, such as innocence, innocence and kindness. My sister is more sensible, and my sister is still a little childish. When I saw them chasing and playing, I saw my sister following her like a little bug, and always shouted: 'Sister, wait for me!' I can't help smiling . In addition, they happily have a pair of good parents, because they also maintain their innocence, although they can no longer see Totoro.Totoro is also really cute, although its cry is a little scary, and its smile is a bit 'strange.' But when it took the umbrella and was a little overwhelmed because it would not be used, we all understood its kindness. Then it 'roared' to its own bus-a big cat with a more weird smile, and left happily, very complacent. Later, this cat car sent the sisters to her mother's hospital, and learned that her mother did not cause any bad news. So the world of the sisters changed from heavy rain to sunny day, and the smile slipped out of my mouth again.There is also an equally cute little boy who, although a little timid, is so shy and cute that he ca n't help but endure. He has a crush on Xiaoyue, so he silently helps her and makes viewers feel warm.Not a heart-breaking tragedy, but the most life-like narrative touched the numb mind.

L.A. Confidential," A template for a complex plot
","The absolute failure of a bad film lies in the scriptwriter, the relative success lies in the director.
The absolute success of not bad films lies in the director, the relative failure lies in the scriptwriter.At first glance, this seems to say that the writer is always bad and the director always makes things happen. In fact, there are at least two kinds of films that I have not discussed, 'good films' and 'bad films'. Instead, I'm emphasizing the importance of screenwriting to a film, especially a drama. There is no good script, no matter how good the director is, he can only make a good film. Although it is said that the director is the soul of a movie, I have always believed that without a good script, the soul cannot be possessed. We have many good directors, but not many good works, largely because we don't have good screenwriters. I don't know since when, with the myth of the founding of the Chinese people can not tell a story? !Back to la confidential, which has won over a million awards for best screenplay, and to be fair, I've never seen a feature film with such a great story, ever! Here to add a word, many film masters and successful films are often set in one, their own written words into the image. The director of the film also participated in the main work of the scriptwriter, which undoubtedly laid a solid foundation for the success of the film. Never has a movie caused me to pause frequently during the movie (I usually like to watch it in a coherent way), or even back to the relevant paragraph for clues to the lines; And there's never been a movie that made me want to bang my head against a wall during a movie (I actually meant it for a moment), because the plot was so unexpected that I'll admit that my brain hasn't yet evolved Hollywood to an advanced stage. When the dust settles, the great lines, the great acting, the complex plot... All let me not long aftertaste.The seven main actors in the film, when the film, either has been a mature old drama bone, or is at the time of the big star, or is the future of the real power. You can imagine how much better it is for the audience to have so many excellent actors working together. With the elaborate lines and dialogue of the scriptwriters, it can be said that they complement each other perfectly. Russell Crowe's integrity and careless hands; Guy Pearce's self-effacing, calculating gentleman; Kevin Spacey looks like a handsome man... I haven't seen a movie like this for a long time that allows me to remember at least five characters at the same time after watching it. The last time was probably akira kurosawa's seven samurai.Actually, I really want to talk about the plot, but I can't bear to reduce your desire to see the movie by revealing the plot, so I have to make a few points. The film of such subject matter now general meeting gives the boundary of good and evil ambiguous change, this film is no exception. But specifically, there are many unique. The first three male heroes are all policemen, with different personalities, and the audience will most clearly like and dislike each other. When the murders 'seemingly' (on the one hand, it does not knot, according to the story development on the one hand, the audience no matter from the rational or emotional also feel it should be the case, faintly feel someone to astray in the three police officers in order to continue to make dramatic conflicts, unexpected three evil suddenly appeared outside (turning point) are performed, and the case continues, this has led to absolute opposition between good and evil, and the audience a different attitude towards the protagonist and unified into support (in fact, the great hero personality differences stand together). And when the final triumph of good over evil (including its own desires), there is an ambiguous treatment in the end. Generally speaking, the plot design is 'ambiguous -- opposite -- ambiguous', which is obviously different from the ambiguous to death design in Hong Kong films or the ambiguous to death design in domestic films.To compliment the plot, more than two hours of film, in the opening is less than half an hour to start, drag the audience in the water, and when the crowd seems to be over with the case has been held up some fatigue (because there are too many clues to the 7788), drama master again, and this time the power because of the large space in front of the bedding, old clues to add new clues, makes efforts to larger, more fierce, is infinite to the audience the enjoyment on the movie. If the first half of the audience can still participate as a crime solver, the second half of the audience can only be an honest outsider, because the development of the story has been beyond the ordinary experience of watching the film. The relationship between the main characters shifts as the story progresses, the center of gravity keeps moving, and before this tension is broken, that tension builds up again.The last thing I want to say is that some people will unconsciously compare it to 'two smoking barrels.' I think for a moment, the comparison is not very great, because the differences between the two are far greater than the similarities, although they both tell a very complex story seamlessly. 'Two barrels of smoke' is notable for its lovely British humor, unique video style and brilliant rock music. 'La confidential,' on the other hand, is shot in the traditional Hollywood style, and its score is mainly jazz, but the music is too monotonous, probably because of the time limit of the story. The highlight of 'la confidential' lies in the fine lines of the writers and the excellent acting of the actors. The two schools of good and evil as well as the different personalities of the three main characters are also easy to lead the audience to participate. 'Two barrels of smoke', on the other hand, dismisses the police for justice, mainly a bunch of people who don't represent justice, so the audience instinctively allows itself to stand off the screen and watch instead of getting into any of the characters. Of course, none of this means that the two countries are superior to each other. It's more due to cultural differences between the UK and the us.",8,0,1,29 April 2020
Children of Heaven," Run in the name of love
","The camera suddenly slows down, and ali's blue sweatshirt swings and swings in the wind. His face was distorted by the strain, his head was moving unconsciously from side to side as he followed his steps, and his sweat was slipping unconsciously down his temples. In the silence there was only the sound of pattering footsteps and their heavy, breathless breathing from lack of oxygen. Near the end of his strength, words began to reverberate in his mind: 'how can I go to school without shoes?' 'come on, Sarah, come on.' 'I'll win third place for you, I will.' So I watched him take a very tense step, step by step ahead of the people. Step by step as if to fight, tears drop big drop down.It was a knot in ali's heart that he owed his sister a pair of shoes he had thrown away. So he ran with all his strength, just to get the third prize, a pair of sneakers. The 5k is like a marathon for a 9-year-old, who won the race with no training or coaching. It was the daily hard and urgent state of life that made him, and the deep love and responsibility that gave him faith, which became the strength of his persistence in the most difficult times.Run, in the name of love. Life, in the name of love.9, childhood should be carefree life, just like ali in the rich area to see the child, with their own toy bear on cany chair swing swing looking at the blue sky, the poor family but ali prematurely to undertake the obligations of as a member of the family, but he also knows a family's most precious emotional connotation, is love and responsibility. He did not tell his parents that he had lost his sister's shoes, not because he was afraid of punishment, but because he knew that the family was in a bad situation and that his mother was seriously ill. He loves his parents and just wants them to worry less and worry less.He had always felt guilty for his sister, Sarah ali, and he tried to make up for it. The excellent student got a golden automatic pencil, which he must have liked very much, as could be seen from the way he carefully took it out and held it in his hand. But he gave it to Sarah and smiled at his sister, and he smiled too. He has been poor at language expression will only silly smile, but the eyes are full of tenderness and love. This kind of tacit understanding and warm feelings between brother and sister, in the ordinary life is always ignored, in the difficult time is so let a person cherish. He loved his sister and just wanted her to be happier and happier.Having only a pair of ali's sneakers, the two had to change for school. They exchanged them in a secluded corner, with Sarah running from school and ali changing shoes before running to school. Because of various delays during Sarah's journey, ali was late almost every time and was warned by his master. But he never said anything about Sarah. He loved his sister and would rather bear all the pressure and pain. When the director tried to throw him out of school for being too late, he could not explain himself but cried in silence. He suddenly did not know how to speak of the bitter twists and turns in it.In the whole film, ali moved me the most, his carefulness and careful love for his sister, his understanding of his parents and his responsibility for his family, which is a feeling that has been lost in ordinary families. We see that the more difficult life is, the more sincere our love for each other is.",8,0,0,1 May 2020
The Prestige," Foreshadowing reveals secrets + questions
","This film does not live up to the title of the film, the plot is complicated, the shooting technique that the director switched from one switch to another is also like a magic. The whole film is full of foreshadowings and tricks everywhere. At first, you are looking at the fog, but as the time of the film develops, suspense begins to be revealed one by one, and your ideas begin to slowly become clear. However, you still can't think of the biggest suspense. You only realized at the last moment of the film was suddenly bright, everything was clear, and the foreshadowings were buried so wonderfully. Ok without looking at other people's reviews, think about the foreshadowing of the final mystery revealed in the film:
1. When Borden stared to change the bird game, Sarah's little nephew saw that the two birds were not the same, and asked persistently: What about his brother? And Burden said: What Actress liu yifei's choice is too good!! I love it!! So happy!! Smart boy. He insinuated his brother here;
2. When Borden went to Sierra's house for the first time, Sierra said goodbye to Borden. When Sarah turned around to close the door, Borden was already in Sarah's room.
3. The foreshadowing of the rope. After Angier's wife died, Angier asked Borden: Which knot did you tie? Borden said: I don't know.
4. It's still a questionable of rope. Before his wife with Angier died, Cutter said to Borden: Why do you always make this kind of mistake every few days, and you will never be allowed to make it again( referring to the wrong knot );
5. Sarah asked: We can't afford him, I will divide my food in half, and I will share other things with him.
6. Then, when Sarah said she was pregnant, Borden's first reaction was: OMG we should tell Fren that we have a baby! Here we are actually referring to the two Borden brothers, not Borden and Sarah.
7. Borden failed to perform the bullet magic, and Sarah bandage him the wound. Borden's wound was strange. There was no bleeding, but then he bleeded again.
8. When Borden said to Sarah everyday that I love you, Sarah said: I think you sometimes say it's true, sometimes it's false.
9. Borden's daughter told Borden that you promised me to go to the zoo today, and Borden froze for a moment: Have I said that? Oh, maybe . Maybe not today, but tomorrow. Here again, he laid the groundwork for his two daily swales.
I have to say that the director is really good. In fact there are many other things in the film, such as : Angier's machine used a blind man as a servant, Angel's instantaneous movement has a hidden door that falls down... etc..., so I will not list them one by one.But the mystery was revealed, and I still have a few questions:
1. What role did Borden's brother exist before the role of Fren appeared?
2. Why did you make some mistake twice? When the two brothers go back alone, can't they communicate.
3. Where did the two brothers grow up as children? Isn't London? Otherwise it's impossible for the two brothers to be same person since childhood.
4. When Sarah said he wanted to tell Olivia, Borden tried to stop it. Logically, Sarah should have know that Borden and Fren did it alternately. Now that she knows, why would someone who doesn't like Sarah continue to be with Sarah? Why don't you just let the one who likes Sarah stay with her.",9,1,2,9 April 2020
Snatch," British black humor
","In a sense, the British sense of humor is very much like the weather in London, cold and damp, always a little obscure. It has been said that the British have a dry sense of humour, not because they do not laugh at their jokes, but because they love telling serious ones. As a result, the British have a bit of a rigid temperament and their sense of humor is always a little bit bashful, seems to be unable to break away from that bit of the so-called traditional reserved.
Guy Ritchie is a master of dark humor, and he's a bit of an outlier among British directors. His films are similar to quentin's in that they both have a strong sense of control over character cues and a dark sense of humor with exaggerated dialogue and plots and a bit of violence. It's a sense of humor that won't make you laugh, but will last forever.The film opens with two seated men, Turk and his sidekick, jumping before they can say more, followed by a scene of a robbery by a group of outlandishly dressed men with fake beards. The comical poses themselves are full of humor, the clothes are full of guns and make people laugh, and the editing technique of the monitor shows the superb skill and creativity of the director.
The film then introduces all the characters one by one. On the one hand, it can be said that it is an explanation of the characters to the audience. On the other hand, it is like a show off by the director.
Indeed, the characters appear one by one, and always one leads up to the other. Although the film is always in a somewhat chaotic rhythm, the characters switch quickly, it will feel confused at first, because the audience needs time to figure out who is who, but the director is not confused at all, after watching the film, you will find that the director's thinking has been very careful and the story is always connected.This is a story about diamonds. There are two main lines to the story.
First, the opening scene of the diamond thief four fingers frank took a giant diamond, he will take the diamond to New York to the boss ivy, but good gambling frank was scar Boris lured to the casino bet, Boris hired three gangsters to rob the casino and grab the diamond from frank's hands. Boris took the diamond and killed frank. Ivy couldn't wait for the diamond to fly from New York to London and hired Tony to help find the diamond. Although the diamond was finally found in the office of the gang, the diamond was a dog diao, random gun, ivy shot Tony.
On the other hand, the man named Turkey in the opening scene needs to find someone to fight in an underground boxing match, while the original fighter is beaten by gypsy mickey when he goes to buy a gypsy station wagon. Turkey can only ask mickey to do it for them, but mickey fails to fall in the fourth round as agreed to let local gang leader topp win money and nearly dies. Top discovered mickey's strength and asked him to play again. Mickey again failed to fall in the fourth round, but ivy was finally known by mickey's gypsy brothers.
The two main lines come together at the end. Turkey finds the dog that swallowed the diamond in the camp after the gypsies leave, and then goes back to the beginning of the film, where the man sitting opposite Turkey and tommy is ivy's man in London. Here the film comes to a screeched halt with the iconic quick cut of its third appearance. The audience is left with endless aftertaste.A multi-threaded story is often a test of the director's skill. The film is a whole, and even if there are multiple threads, they must be combined together like DNA. The technique is not new. The characters are connected by chance encounters, and one pushes the other forward like dominoes, thus driving the story forward. And unlike pulp fiction story but leading role is a link between the change of tactics, the number of characters 'snatch' more and there is no clear, primary and secondary story is complete, each group of meet the development of the plot fusion is very good, everyone is leading role, everyone have their own unique personality, so the audience can always see a group of crazy people performance and do not ignore any one.
Similarly, the director's excellent editing ability is also an important guarantee to master the multi-line story. Instead of a full-length editing game, the director USES only small clips to show his ability. There are four impressive:
One, lie in the echo of head tail. This technique is not uncommon, but this one is a little different, and the movie ends with a flashback to the opening scene that the audience still doesn't understand, until the old face of the diamond dealer appears and the film ends while the audience is still reminiscing.
Second, a pile-up of milk on the road. Take a look at each car and film what's happening to each of them. The director's editing is masterly, and this episode connects ivy's people to the mob, allowing the story to continue.
Third, ivy from the United States to the United Kingdom of rapid cutting. Closing the taxi door, taking the pills, Concorde, visa stamps, taxi lights on, it's pretty neat, pretty comic, and it sets the scene for the end of the movie.
Fourth, the dog chase rabbit and black fat taryn was hit cut together. On the one hand, it increases the comic effect of the film, on the other hand, it makes the film less bloody.Guy is on the control have to surprise of the film, and at the same time, he doesn't focus on depicting a bloody scenes in the film, and in editing in dialogue with the actors in the story itself to represent black humor, therefore, even if the whole film is obscure dim, but what impress the audience is still the British cold black humor.",8,1,2,24 April 2020

Pan's Labyrinth," Aofeiliya and her flowers
","It was 1944 in Spain, and the smoke from the civil war had not yet cleared.
Major fighting in the Spanish civil war ended in 1939. That year, the left party led by the republican army defeated, general franco led the fascist officers overthrew Spain's second republic, the establishment of a military dictatorship. The surviving republican army was forced to organize into small units to wage guerrilla warfare in the mountains. The military regime carried out a ruthless campaign against the guerrillas to consolidate the fruits of victory.
Ophelia, 14, took her book and followed her pregnant mother to the mountains where her stepfather, captain Vidal, was stationed. The captain was ordered to round up the guerrillas hiding in the mountains. He was an outstanding fascist soldier, self-disciplined, cold, resolute, brave and inaccessible.
Here ophelia, a lover of fairy tales, found a dilapidated maze. Carved on a beam at the entrance to the maze was the face of pan, with three black holes in its eyes and mouth, giving it a wild and mysterious look. Right in the middle of the maze was a round chamber in the ground. Down the stone staircase, in the middle of the chamber is a miniature maze. In the middle was a stone statue, the top of which was the face of the same pan with the three black holes. Below was a girl with a baby in her arms.
Legend has it that the spirit of the underworld princess still roamed the earth, and her father had been waiting for her reincarnation and to take her home. Ophelia found an old pan in the maze. He will give ophelia three tasks. If she can successfully complete the three tests before the full moon, she can return to her father's palace.
From then on the story jumps back and forth between the magic kingdom and the mountain battlefield. One moment it was little lady fighting ugly toad; One moment it was guerrilla informants trying to smuggle letters, food and medicine; For a while the little princess in the white devil's hand narrowly escaped death, for a while is the captain of the captives of the bloody methods. Together on the night of the full moon, we saw the end of a story that fantasy and reality cannot tell apart. It's all so powerful.
In Shakespeare's famous Hamlet, Ophelia is the lover of prince Hamlet. Hamlet feigned madness for revenge and abandoned her. Later, the prince killed her father, Polonius. The double whammy sends ophelia into a real frenzy, and she ends up drowning while trying to break flowers.
The name 'ophelia' is like a huge shadow hanging over the little girl. The beautiful ophelia was forced by the reality into a person's fantasy world, she told her unborn brother a story of roses. The rose that gives immortality grows on the top of a high mountain. To get close to it is to go through a number of terrible trials and tribulations. Gradually people forget the original purpose, just pass on the difficulties along the way from generation to generation. Long in the mountains, can bring people eternal roses so lonely waiting for the end of time.
The fairy tale ophelia tells her brother also hints at the future of her early death. Ophelia in Hamlet falls into a river while folding flowers. Our ophelia died while pursuing her dream of an eternal kingdom.
It's not them that are crazy, it's the reality they live in.
At that time, people did not know whether they could see the sun of tomorrow. Or yesterday they were reading newspapers and letters home in the cave, and today they were killed by cold bullets. They all aspire to build a better country, but the path they choose makes it impossible for them to co-exist.
The reality of cruelty is that soldiers will expertly fire a second round at the head of a dead enemy to ensure a clean sweep of the battlefield -- something that both sides can do regardless of political position. Torture tools small, simple but the effect of the 'good' is extremely horrible.
The cruelty in the magic is that the white magic that eats children has even its fingertips soaked in the blood of old people. Next to the ogre's table laden with delicacies were hills of children's shoes.
Most cruelly, ophelia was killed, and she breathed her last in the glory of the underground kingdom. And that world turned out to be just a fantasy of her loneliness.
The camera tells these details calmly and carefully. No emotion, no big close-up, no blur, no emotion.
That's the end of the 1944 story. It was a long thirty-one year before the day on which general franco and his regime were to return to normal. There are many more children whose lives will pass quietly.",8,0,0,5 May 2020

Robert DE niro in the film is very thin, although a tired, but the real young, and very handsome, I really think so. His performance in the film is introverted, everyone will pile on the ambiguous smile, when a person, the face is expressionless.
Martin scorsese and Robert DE niro work together to create an image of the weary, the weary from the inside out.
Travis coming from the war, although young, she has experienced the vicissitudes of life, he is a man, driving a bright old cab ramble in the river, both white and black ghetto or what is shady area, he go through it all, so what happen maybe he want, good disturb his boring life, even if it is a bad thing, but what things didn't happen to him, so he began to find their own things to do.
He saw a woman, she was wearing a white coat, appeared in front of his mature grace, symbolizes the purity of never being polluted, he fell in love with her, even in the heart of parents also mentioned her, he ask her to have dinner, buy her she ever mentioned record, but they, after all, not a man of the world, so he make her office, was finally booted out.
Then she met another woman, and the first woman is the opposite, she was reduced to dust, pure and she did not come close, but young rebellious, unworldly. Instead of saving her the first time they met, he drove away, and because of that, he remembered him.
Then, for no apparent reason, he wanted to kill the President. He prepared everything meticulously, as if there was a blood feud with him, and every procedure was not neglected. When he appeared on the outskirts of the crowd with his new haircut, he finally externalized his weariness.
Travis, care about the process and the behavior of the to do a thing in itself, rather than the result of this matter, at the same time, he to the society at that time, although he is very dirty, very disappointed, but he shot the President's behavior is not disappointed at his record, want others to President candidate, so want to, just to think of Travis too radical, he was tired of everything, don't care who will run the country. So when he failed to assassinate him, he immediately gave up and went on to what he called a plan to free Ellis.
Before that he has met several times, and Ellis his righteousness is words to advise Ellis to stop working in the same, really is persuasive, but Ellis is not brought his affection, she also don't think what's wrong with the present life, she was immersed in a pimp false tender feelings sweet meaning, it's hard to imagine that Ellis will hold such a strong sense of justice. Perhaps Travis simply saw Ellis' makeover as another way to pass the time in his life.
He acted after the assassination of the President.
Just borrow one and kill them all. I've heard a saying before, the timid are afraid of the bold, and the bold are afraid of the desperate. Measured by this standard, Travis is undoubtedly the most terrible what kind of person, he doesn't care about being hit, the reason why he escape is before you want to hit all the others, so when all the gunfire stopped screaming only Ellis, Travis lifted the pistol, aimed at his chin, successive a few trigger, if there were bullets in the gun, Travis early die, but god don't let him get a bullet didn't give him the rest.
When the police arrived, Travis smiled as he watched them raise their bloody left hands to his temple and pull the trigger.
Maybe the world is too ridiculous to be taken seriously.
Travis has experienced the cruelty of war, with the exhaustion of body and mind to leave the battlefield, the war only bring pain for him, but I did not bring any honor, when he USES the bloody and violent to defeat their spiritual emptiness and tired, when he put all the order and the moral principles behind, but fate and he opened a joke, let him be the hero of media coverage, won the appreciation of people, after all this, Travis, can not think how ridiculous.
After the injury healed, he was discharged from the hospital, his hair grew back, he started driving a taxi again, and his life was on the right track. Perhaps after this, Travis was completely relieved.
When he met the girl he had been attracted to, he looked at her in the rearview mirror. She was still very bright and attractive. Yes, seeing this movie, I couldn't help but doubt the credibility of the type printed on it every day.
He politely talked to her about her support for the President without looking any different, as if he had completely forgotten that he was about to assassinate him. He never tried to ask her out for dinner or a movie until he took her home, because he knew she had a good taste and would turn up her nose at the porn she liked.
She stood in front of the car bent over, hesitated, as if to say something, but the words, the absence of a completely different, how much?
As soon as the words were out of their mouths, they completely replied to each other, crossed off everything in the past, he smiled, said a goodbye, and drove away. Leave her behind, with a slightly wistful expression. This time, it's really goodbye.
I believe that Travis will never kill anyone again and will never fall in love with anyone again. He is just in front of his taxi driver and only has the relationship of money and interests with all people. He is not afraid of anything.
The streets of the night are flashing with colorful bright lights, to the world paint it does not have the color, like a cocktail, very rich, but not pure.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Shutter Island," Fear of life and fear of death
","When tragedy happens and you can't face it, you can go crazy, or you can choose to go crazy. If you don't choose to go crazy, you will. It's as simple as that.A lot of times people wonder: how do the criminals, the moral scum, the hypocrites, how do they continue to live in this world in the face of their evil deeds every day? If only I were dead.It doesn't have to be in some mysterious way. We all do the same thing every single day. When a person does something wrong and there is a conflict between behavior and attitude, it can be very uncomfortable. This is because people have a need for the unity of mind and body. But wrong has become a fact can not change, then can only change the attitude. Psychology is called cognitive dissonance.The phenomenon of cognitive dissonance, first described by Leon Festinger, has inspired more than 3,000 experiments. To some extent, this mechanism of adjusting our attitude to our behavior is a healthy self-protection mechanism, otherwise we will be regretting the stupid things we do every day, feeling guilty and unable to eat or sleep. Festinger's student Elliot Aronson has written a book called 'Mistakes Were Made (but not by me)' to explain why we not only defend our stupid behavior and bad decisions, but find a way out, and even get stronger under the circumstances. In short, just to make myself feel better.But sometimes the reality is tragic to the point where normal rationalizing mechanisms for mistakes are no longer sufficient to produce any positive results. Like when you come home from work one day and you find your three kids all drowned in a lake and you shoot this woman. Then you recall that your wife was already showing signs of insanity, but you didn't listen, and you didn't act quickly enough to prevent that from happening.How do you talk yourself out?
<ul><li>There 's no way.</li></ul>Teddy Daniels is teetering on the brink of collapse. So he chooses to create for himself a new reality, another reality that can explain the madness of reality -- called illusion. He chose to go insane to keep himself from going insane and killing himself.Maybe it was a cowardly choice.On a sunny day after a storm, Teddy sat on the steps outside, smoked a cigarette, and said to his doctor, 'we can trick them.' when he said, 'Don't worry partner, they're not gonna catch us, Chuck.' when Dr. Sheen shook his head to Dr. Cawley, the audience was convinced that he was back in the world of fantasy.But at the end of the day, before he turned his head and came to pick up the man who had done the operation, Teddy said, 'I wonder, is it better to live like a monster, or die a good man?' Is it better to die a good man, or to live like a wild beast?In reality, Teddy is the man who killed his wife who drowned his children. After the operation, he will become a man with no memory. Although he will die believing that he is a good man who has never done anything wrong, he is a walking corpse without memory. Is it not a living monster? In other words, to die a good man, he had to live like a monster for the rest of his life.They say that in the end, Teddy chose die a good man, which shows the brave side of human nature. Not really. Just because There is no 'better' way.It's just another choice without a choice.When old luo is talking, he once said that 'a strong life needs no explanation'. And the tragedy of life, because there is no way to explain. Whenever there is a little rut, can make do with rationalizing everything that happens, also can always survive. We still have some resilience.But self justification always has a bad day. What are you going to live on? Nothing is reliable.I guess that's what I was trying to say.",8,0,0,10 May 2020
Full Metal Jacket," How are you twisted?
","'Born to kill' or 'human nature is good' are not all of a person's instincts. This is the contradiction of people, and also the two sides of everything in the world.
From entering the boot camp to writing the news in the post-war base area, the clown actually reflects the human nature of the environment. At the beginning of his body, he openly contradicted the drillmaster's words, and even got some recognition. When people around him couldn't teach 'fat pie' well, he took over the task and kept the other side in good order.
But it is here that the virulence of the story suddenly becomes apparent. The joker didn't stop the new recruits from destroying the party. Instead, he joined the group. To the joker himself, this may be interpreted as an outburst of repression. As an ordinary person, it is perfectly normal to consciously or unconsciously suppress their own nature in the environment, in this particular occasion has a proper release. But after, it will become his nightmare.
That's when fat pie changed. Mumbling, horrible eyes, quick action. But no one expected the final outburst. It is said that the suicide scene was supposed to take place in the dormitory, but kubrick changed it to a toilet. This kind of sudden in enclosed and secluded place can show a chilling effect especially, let alone specially chose white. White, which we have always thought of as the color of solemnity, purity and equality, became the spokesman of extreme violence in kubrick. Think of alex's clockwork orange, the milk he was drinking, and his tightly wrapped coat.
To say that perry was a victim of the pre-war system is not entirely true. The relentless routine required no warmth, but a killing machine, an environment in which everyone was at risk and had no time to look around, and in an era when you couldn't expect redemption from anyone else, perry's initial dullness held everyone back. Perry eventually killed hartman, but it wasn't a revolt. Instead, there was deep confusion. Then he turned the abb's cruel, piercing eyes, and turned them hollow, and blew his head open. This section, kubrick's treatment is clean, transparent, with a cold look on. In contrast to the first half of the recruit training in the lively opening and the irony of mockery.
The recruits went to war, and the joker became one of the war correspondents. There is no war here, but there is much reflection on the Vietnam war, which is especially represented by the clown. All he saw was a farce directed and staged by the United States to prove its ability, but it also had its own contradictions: he wanted to go to the front, and he wanted to win, even though he knew it was impossible, and the 'no way to win.' As he put it, every human being is 'born to kill,' and even a dull man like perry knows how to pull the trigger to subdue his instructor, whom he never dares to disobey. On the other side is the desire of the heart to do good. I'm not an expert on humans, and I don't know what instinct is, but privately I think we should have both sides, depending on which side overpowers which one at the critical moment.
The final ironic moment came when a group of American soldiers broke through to find the sniper who had fired at them, only to discover that it was a young Vietnamese girl. This is a satire on hegemonic policy and power, and a lament for war - no one has a self any more, just a state's war machine. The joker raises his gun and still ends up with a girl who is better than dead. You can understand it as a victory for the human side in his body, but the sneer of a peary in the toilet in his mind will be his lifelong nightmare. Is the war has long been obliterated by the human nature, by the system seriously distorted under the brainwashed people, even if there was a brief recovery, but how?",8,0,0,23 April 2020

","At the beginning of the old silly, really thought it was a true story adapted. After looking at the reviews, I found that it was not. What's more, a Japanese woman was frozen to death after she climbed mountains and mountains in search of the treasure in the movie.
I completely fainted. Don't normal people have the ability to distinguish between true and false? It reminds me of the news many years ago that some writer wrote a book with a telephone number as its title. Result the actual host of this telephone number receives n many telephone everyday, accuse author tort blablabla later.Going back to the movie, it looks like that's all there is to it. But read aftertaste but more and more feel to have a look, good classic black humor. It's hard to guard against the unexpected. Everyone has a role to play.

Léon: The Professional," I protect you in my own way.
","I love you, so I don't kiss you. I love you so I speak coldly to you. I love you so I want you to leave me and live your own life. I love you so I choose to protect you silently. Protection is my way of loving you. This is Lyon'a love for Mathil. The love of fish for birds cannot be shelved. Only choose this way to love. Love is forgiving, love is hurt.
A killer should not be too kind, and should not care about a person. Lyon is not a good killer.
It is often wondering why Lyon had to carry that pot of green dill is no matter where he went, and why in the last crisis moment he still instructed Mathil to take care of Actress liu yifei's choice is too good!! I love it!! So happy!! Pot of plants. What's so strange about a pot of plants. Lulu is the best evidence that Lyon is not a good killer. Lulu represents the weak, the people who need protection and care, and the love that Lyon could not protect. In fact Lyon really wants to love someone, protect her, take care of her, pamper her. If the person does not show up, then he has to fill this void with a pot of green dill. Mathil was like a pot of vigorous green dill filling his broken heart. The revolving staircase, brown and black, reveals a simple and dignified atmosphere. Step by step up the stairs, spinning, spinning, lost with the rotation of the stairs, at the end of the rotation, a fairy-like girl is waiting quietly. Smoking cigarettes unruly and pretending to be mature. At first it was often inadvertent. Knowing that in your own identity, it's best not to provoke the evil police who are not as good as crazy dogs. However, in the fact of Mathil's pleading, his cold heart began to melt. The door opened and Lyon greeted Mathilda, giving her a safe haven and also giving her lonely heart a chance to redeem.
As a result, this elf-life mature and childish girl stubbornly stuck in Lyon's life and would never leave again. She stubbornly asked him to help his brother revenge, stubbornly asked him to teach her to ' clean up' stubbornly asked him to love her, care about her, stubbornly transformed his life. Reason told Lyon that the killer must not have feelings. He must kill her.
However his heart had been shaken. His life is no longer just about killing people and that pot of green dill. He really loves her, he can break into the police station for her alone, and deal with Agent Hundred for her alone. He didn't forget to avenge Mathilda until he died, burying himself in a royal.
His love is so deep. A teenage elf-like girl, an indifferent man in his 30s or 40s; an angle who can hear the call of the Lord at any time, a bloody demon with hands in his hands... No matter what, it is an insurmountable gap. He can only hide this love that cannot be put aside in his heart. The surface kept refusing her. It was not until the last moment that she dared to say to her; ' Mathilda , I love you' Only at this time, this sentence may become a ticket to send little Mathilda to return to the world, instead of biting her life. Fuse. In this world, is there such a person who can open a door or you a safe haven. Is there a person who can love you so deploy and forbesringly, protect you silently, endure your stubbornness, love you but refuse you.",8,0,2,5 April 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Wow
","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings is a movie for our times. If we look past the stunning visual effects, lush scenery, and spectacular action sequences, and listen to the wisdom of Gandalf and Galadriel we hear the quiet whisper of the true meaning of the film- heroism. The message of this film is that true heroes are not the great and powerful, but the everyday person placed unexpectedly into trying circumstances. What a message at this time in our country's history. On September 11th we saw normal, everyday peoples lives changed suddenly, unexpectedly. They were forced to be heroes, to work to save not only their own lives, but the lives of others too. As Gandalf says, we do not choose what times we live in, but we choose what we do with the time we have.
Remember this theme and focus on Frodo's trials and perserverance whenever you watch this movie. Remember the loyalty and friendship of Sam. That is what this movie is truly about.
Peter Jackson has created a visually stunning film, filled with action, yet rich with meaning. He has for the most part stayed true to the themes and sequences in the books. While he has changed some characters and scenes, those changes do not significantly alter the plot and in some instances actually improve it.
Though the movie is played out on a grand scale, the film is really about a story of one little hobbit, Frodo, and his unexpected challenge of having to be a hero.
The score by Howard Shore is superb, quite worthy of the Oscar it received. The score is destined to become a classic.
The cinematography is also superb, also definitely worthy of its Oscar.
My one criticism, is that Saruman is given more time on screen than in the books. I felt he should be more so behind the scenes as he was in the books. The more sinister evil is the evil that cannot be seen. Though Christopher Lee, as always, is superb.
The rest of the cast is also superb, especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo. Kate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are also excellent in their roles, bringing a strong female presence.",9,0,0,25 March 2020

North by Northwest," The Great Alfred Hitchcock
","I was patient enough to see the 136-minute North By Northwest. I expected it to be a little boring. It was an old 1959 movie. However, as The opening music progressed, I began to realize that this film must be worthy of his title of The Master of Suspense. Sure enough, I sank in slowly, like a sponge. Oh, no, it's a bounce bed. It's thrilling and fascinating.I want to admire this work which has integrated almost all shooting techniques, one unit continuous and jump.Close up!The lead actor, Cary Grant, is often seen in close-up. He has a handsome edge. So you see particularly for him, in the play of Roger's encounter and worried, a Russian spy targeted, was mistaken for an FBI member, is actually not there, the intelligence agency coined the 'Mr.Medium shotUsually in Hollywood movies, men are shot in this way. Oh, the mid-shot stays on the waist, which makes the man in the camera appear larger.Medium long shotSeveral gentlemen were talking in the bar with the picture frame above their knees. It has the same meaning as a medium shot.POV shotIt's a wonderful scene where the hero is drinking and driving after being given a big drink of bourbon. We could only see through his eyes in the headlights. The black water lapping against the shore reef, the extremely narrow coastal road, the oncoming cars, the enemy following behind, created a scene of horror. For fear that an accident might happen if he was not careful. Our hearts are gripped by Hitchcock's subjective lens.It is interesting to note that the heroine Eve is often presented with a glance from Roger. So implicit and secret. Blonde, delicate cloud dress, such a distinctive female body is also a trick to catch the eye of the audience.Shot/reverse shotPositive and negative shots are used in conversations between two people. Roger&Eve had a good time talking over dinner in the train car. This kind of technique builds sweet atmosphere for them namely. Heaven and earth are quiet, the only restless is the two people of the world quietly growing feelings.Long shotAs Roger waits in the wilderness for what he thinks is the real Mr Caplin to arrive, the film appears in a 50-second panorama. Watching the bus come from far away, we are all worried, is that 'kaplin'? So the roar of the bus approaching and car shadow gradually let us disappointed again and again.The suspense master again captures the audience's psychological activities and makes use of them.Extreme shotNow for the final scene, the two sides wrestle over a rock with stone statues of all the American presidents. A big panorama with the widest view. At one end of the rock, the hero and heroine are climbing down. And they can't see it, right up there is the pursuer, and we see it in this big panorama, and we're really nervous for them.Roger pulls Eve up from a cliff, and as the camera pans, he pulls her hand up in a train car, my dear lady.It turns out that reading movies is fun. I wish I had the courage to love movies. I want to put a bird on my shoulder and pay tribute to HITCHCOCK.",8,0,0,23 April 2020
The Shining," From novels to movies
","It is hard to see anyone dissecting the film further. The reason may be that people who like video may not have read steffenkin's original novel. After watching the 1990s TV version, I basically saw the shining on three different media. Combined with my reading of other Stephen king novels. I want to join you as we enter the world of the shining and unravel its mysteries.
'The shining,' like Stephen king's other horror novels, is rooted in everyday life. From the extreme experience of a person on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Jack, as an amateur author, is similar in age and condition to the unknown Stephen king. The same poor, with a family and a family, by part-time work to make ends meet. You can imagine the crossroads of life, what kind of low point they are in, suffering from anxiety and despair. The writer himself is often separated from the flesh, by the cruel external life of the pressure of erosion, unable to calm, in the division. On the one hand, I was responsible for my wife and children; on the other hand, I had to sacrifice my family to complete my writing career. This sense of ambivalence and despair is skillfully translated by Stephen king into the inner tension of the whole horror story.
The nature of the writer is similar to that of the dictator, who is also in extreme loneliness. To choose a snowy hotel is to enter a self-enclosed inner world. At this point, jack is cut off from the rest of the world, waiting for inspiration. You can think of the ghosts as the creation of jack, as the creation of a writer. They called him to cheer him up. Binary opposition, Wendy represents the outside world, she and the children are the only voice from the real world to jack's ears. I think the child's irrational behavior must have greatly interfered with and tortured Stephen king's writing. So it became the first target of jack's subconscious mind.
The original novel has a great outlet for kuyt's film, which I suspect is why the writer has always resisted the film. The protagonist of the novel from the triumph of the self and the death of the ghost of the hero into a bloody crazy murderer, is a bit of a polar opposite. What's more, the protagonist jack himself is the portrayal of the writer's mental journey, how can he accept such a tragic end? We can see the director's intention by comparing the difference between the two. The murder weapon in the novel has changed from a baseball bat that is common in everyday American life to an axe used in horror movies. Jack is the real hero in the novel, not killing anyone, and the black chef finally helps Wendy and Danny escape from the hotel. In the film, however, the black man is simply hacked to death with a single knife, breaking jack's zero record for murder. It is clear that the director had to sacrifice this minor character in order to enhance the violent effect and enhance the visual conflict with the audience. This has nothing to do with racial persecution. In the novel, jack appears years later at Danny's graduation ceremony, silently blessing his son's growth. The scene is warm and moving, a pair of affection forever appearance. The film escalates jack's madness until it collapses and he freezes to death in the maze.
Stephen king, after all, wanted to be a bestselling novelist, not to take his subject to the next level, and as a successful man, he could laugh at the past, restore the image of a loving father, and preserve the integrity of middle-class values. Kubrick is clearly trying to make a moral out of it, a portrayal of modern man's inability to communicate, his self-destruction, and his habitual anxiety about modern civilization.
The film itself is controversial, with different opinions. I think it won mainly because of the atmosphere and Nicholson's performance, and more as a classic genre film.",7,0,1,12 April 2020

With a warm smile on his face across the table was a photograph of a family reunion. Perhaps if it had not been for the misunderstanding of the navy captain, he would have succeeded in flying to happiness with his sweetheart and daughter.At the end of the movie, I am recalling the life of the little man, which is also an ordinary life. 'For what happened to me, I can be angry, but the world is so beautiful, it's hard to stay angry, sometimes I feel like I encounter too many beautiful things at a time, almost can not stand, my heart is like a balloon inflation, is about to blast, and then I remember to relax, do not grasp not to put, so it just like the rain washed away, and I have no feeling, only grateful, grateful for every moment of my stupid life, I'm sure you don't understand what I'm talking about, but don't worry, someday you will understand.'I also don't understand, many things originally need time to fill, life is too much out of control, for life, you, I, are not a bystander, but that only by the wind is disorderly blowing by people with eye shit stare at the plastic bag.",8,0,0,16 April 2020
Warrior," Forgiveness is such a difficult and simple thing.
","In your life, are there any people who have made you grumble, and in the dark night, fantasizing various scenarios and giving him deep revenge. For example, after a child had publicly beat your classmates, such a let you taste the taste of betrayal of a friend, for example, let you hurt a girl like you face a lot of years, suddenly do not know how their loved ones face.I have got. All of the above. So I know how difficult it is to forgive.This is a movie that has kept me speechless for a long time. It is one of the rare ones. After reading it, I do n't know how to talk about it. Because there are too many scars involved in what I want to say.This is also a very rare kind of film, which I agree, but hardly recommend to people. Although in my personal 2011 movie, this film is the most important, there is no one.I can understand that some people are indifferent to the feelings inside, and even feel false. Because you have never experienced something, you will never understand it. I can't understand why people with the same bloodline will not forgive each other because of some unnecessary knots. A person who cannot understand quite mature, sometimes suddenly so immature. Unable to understand the roaring son, he hugged his father Shen Sheng to comfort; and after the younger brother and the older brother fisted with each other, they helped him away. Unable to understand why it is so easy to forgive such a difficult thing, so illogical, so unreal.In fact, life is illogical.Talking to strangers, and cold eyes to those closest to you, this is the most common life.Three months after watching the film, my father came to the city from more than two thousand kilometers away. We spent a few days together, carefully with each other. The day before he left, we sat and spoke very late. Mainly he was talking, trying to explain something, I listened.Speaking of that he cried later, facing the aging face, like the son in the movie, I did not cry. But in my heart, something finally melted.When he left, I felt I could finally say something about this movie.My father, I have forgiven you. Not because of the explanations you made to me, but because you tried to explain to me, the matter itself.",8,0,0,10 May 2020
Judgment at Nuremberg," It's hard to reflect on yourself.
","First of all, the plot of the movie is interesting: it is the judge of the victorious country who tries the judge of the defeated country.The reason of the victors was that the judges of the defeated countries had not only failed to uphold justice and violated the dignity of the law when the nazis were in politics, but also helped the nazis to implement many inhuman ACTS.
Of the four judges on trial, the best was janine, not only in attitude, but also in reflection:
After the defeat of Germany, the national economy was in a state of great depression because of the huge reparations. However, the rise of Hitler not only improved people's livelihood, promoted economic development, solved the problem of employment, increased national strength, but also greatly cultivated national self-confidence and pride. Can such a man be unpopular with the people? He took the germans out of the shadow of the first world war and inferiority, gave Germany strength and hope, he hoped to lead all the people in Europe can develop like Germany, so he did not stop using force to achieve his grand goal. As far as Hitler's rhetoric is concerned, it would be good news for europeans if his dream came true. Under the efforts of Hitler and the Nazi party, the iron fact made people believe that everything Hitler did was for the happiness of the whole nation, and there was no reason not to support him. The servants in the film also said that Hitler did a lot of good things for the germans, such as building roads.
In such a situation, even the judge has lost his judgment, let alone ordinary people? And he didn't like Hitler himself.
Mrs Berhalter defends her husband: he does not like the nazis, he does not like Hitler, but as a soldier it is his duty to obey orders. But in the end her husband was executed;
At the same time, many people did not know about the camp because it was carried out by the ss, the stormtroopers and the secret police.
In this trial, the defense of janine's lawyer was brilliant, asking the right questions:Janine said, 'our achievements are based on our lofty ideals.' why are we successful? What about the rest of the world? Don't they know the intentions of the third Reich? Didn't they hear what Hitler was saying around the world? Did they publish in all the countries of the world what mayne canaveri had to say about his intentions? What was the role of the Soviet union, which had signed an agreement with Hitler in 1939 to encourage him to wage war? Can we convict the soviets? What is the Vatican's responsibility for reaching the height of Hitler's prestige by signing an agreement with him in 1933? Can we convict the Vatican? Is the world leader Winston Churchill to blame? 1938! 1938! In an open letter in The Times of London, he said that when England had suffered a national catastrophe, I should pray to god to send a wise and resolute Hitler. Can we convict Churchill? Where is the responsibility of those American industrialists? Can we convict these American industrialists of helping Hitler make weapons and profit from them? No, Sir, no, only the germans are innocent, and the whole world is responsible for Hitler and Germany. It is easy to convict a man on the bench, it is easy to say that the German system and people were at fault for Hitler's rise to power, while at the same time turning a blind eye to the institutional and national errors with which the soviets had signed the agreement with him, and Churchill praised him and the americans for helping him.
Janin said he was wrong, and if so, janin's sin was the sin of the world.
If they are all guilty, the russians, the British, and the americans are also guilty, why are the others/countries not tried, and why should the americans judge only them?
But the story of a winner and a loser.
If the americans had lost the war and the germans had won, perhaps there would have been a change in the dock and the bench, and in this trial the American judge who had won the war said that the German judge who had lost the war had not presided over the execution of the law. In this sense, the trial of these judges is a political game, because the law in such cases is not neutral, but victorious. The law here is not the representative of justice, but the puppet of politics. As the movie says, the men were sentenced, but they were eventually released for political reasons.
It is conceivable that if the United States fought Iraq, and the United States lost, and Iraq occupied the United States, instead of saddam hussein being tried and hanged, bush being tried and hanged. Consider judge Hahn's closing statement: germans fight for their lives and must take specific measures to ensure it is not invaded by foreign enemies. How similar this is to the rhetoric of the United States in the war on terror.
Through this film, it is very good for the so-called victors to reflect on what role we played in the tragedy of the world. We have always said that justice will prevail, is the story of the world are eulogizing the victory of justice, but saw this film, but I felt the victory are just. That is to say, not to say that justice will prevail, but victory will be justice. Which reminds me of another sentence: evil is to win, because just stand by.I wonder if that's what the Chinese government means when they keep saying that most Japanese are innocent? Are ordinary good people victims of a system, an idea, a propaganda voice and a machine?
It is easy to condemn others, but difficult to reflect on oneself",7,0,0,6 May 2020
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The sequel is better.
","The first movie in the history is classic enough, and the sequel can surpass the first movie. John connor teleports Reese into the past in terminator 1; Reese and Sarah connor gave birth to John connor, forming a closed loop. The same is true of terminator 2, where skynet transported the t-800 into the past to give humans the terminator chip that inspired skynet's creation. So they're going to find miles dyson and break the cycle. Miles dyson was responsible for inventing skynet and indirectly destroying the world in the parallel universe, where he became a hero protecting humanity at the cost of life. John connor's change of attitude towards his mother is also striking. He always thought his mother was crazy and a loser. Until one day, he found that everything his mother said was true. Skynet made the t-800's central processing unit read-only, preventing it from generating thoughts. Such a soulless killer is willing to end himself in exchange for world peace. Who says machines can't be human? The thumbs-up shot in the flames is one of the most powerful moments in film history.",8,0,0,6 April 2020
Dangal," It's not easy to choose.
","In the movie, Geeta, the eldest daughter, trains with her father and plays for the first time. Four boys lined up, some thin, some sturdy, and Geeta chose. Of course, everyone in the audience believed that even the weakest boy could beat the Geeta girl. But Geeta chose his strongest rival.Like all the wrestling scenes in the show, the fight that followed was real and exciting. Opponents at first disdain, suffered a loss, soon learned to handle with caution. Geeta was focused, trying to seize every opportunity. The audience also from the relaxed mood of watching the play, become nervous and engaged. Geeta lost to his opponent but won the respect of the crowd. But she was disappointed. Her father said she had conquered her fear.Geeta had lived passively under his father's demon training. Even if we agree ideologically with our father, we can't get a glimpse of Geeta's true character. But this simple choice on the field brought Geeta's character to light. As my father later concluded, Geeta was an aggressive tiger. This domineering choice was the best preparation for Geeta's fate. Even if the opponent is bigger, even if Geeta is lost, we also know that this girl's heart sleeps a fierce tiger.Choice is an exam question.Let's think about another girl. She lived in developed Europe and America and loved wrestling since childhood. With the support of her parents, she met the best coach and successfully won the Olympic championship. In such a life, the dream is like the lamp, no longer need to choose the trouble. Just such a film is made out, at most is a youth inspirational fairy tale: sweet but difficult to shock people. This is not to say that there are no plain sailing people. It is only in the face of difficult choices that human nature is often fully manifested. Moviegoers are willing to sit in front of the screen for two or three hours, expecting to see the true humanity of the choices.Because of the choice of time and often, the character of the character becomes three-dimensional. The father is stubborn and conceited, but when he massages his daughter's ankles, he questions his own harshness. Even when he had chosen the road for his daughter, he had added a year's time to his worries. When the professional coach humiliates in front of him, his father, who always refuses to admit defeat, takes it in his face. But when the daughter sobbed on the other end of the phone, the father did not hesitate, the next day to the daughter's city, quietly for his daughter as a practice partner. Throughout the film, amir khan, who plays the father, is unsmiling and has the same serious expression that many fathers do. But these choices, and the hesitancy and determination of his choices, gave me a sense of the richness of this father.Geeta's success comes with a string of choices. After becoming a national champion, she opted for a more professional-looking coach, abandoning her father's skills. More importantly, she also gave up her focus on wrestling. In subsequent international competitions, Geeta did poorly. Meanwhile, the director deliberately accentuates the scene of Babita, the second daughter, and seems to want to abandon Geeta and turn Babita into a champion hero. In the difficult situation, Geeta chose to let go of her strong self-esteem and retrain according to her father's method. In the last moment of her father's absence, she chose to grow up alone, with a beautiful rainbow to win the gold medal, completed the transformation of an independent woman.Some film critics argue that a father pushing his daughter to train violates 'women's rights'. Yet women's rights have always been more than a slogan that can be easily uttered. The feminist movement in Europe and the United States began at the end of the 19th century. In the hard, dirty and dangerous textile workshops, working women have a choice to make: be content with what they earn, or fight for more women's rights. As reflected in suffragette, the hard-won right to vote for women was paid a heavy price by the feminist movement. Similarly, in post-world war ii America, when men returned from the war, women in military factories faced the dilemma of returning to their families or staying at work. After years of hesitation, American women have chosen to fight for women's rights. Women's rights meant accepting the 'choice' test, not the easy life.Similarly, in India and many other developing countries, women's social status is low. Even if the most outstanding people to cry, it is difficult to change the traditional strong inertia. In the face of difficult choices, there is no way to have it both ways. It is true that the father forced his daughter at first. But as the father proudly declared, 'let the daughter be strong enough to choose her husband'. That's what makes movies valuable. It makes no secret of the cruelty of reality, whether it is early marriage, paternity, bureaucracy, or even the intensity and danger of wrestling itself. But for all the social problems, the film also holds a brave heart to choose. Father and daughter choose, act, then from humble beginning, until their own goal.Before the screen, we can also have a choice?",9,0,0,21 April 2020
Apocalypse Now," Human Alienation
","I read it in college and didn't understand it. This film is not exactly a war film, not even an anti-war, but alienation of people. From this perspective, if World War I is the entrance to the irrational world for the West, then the Vietnam War is the pinnacle, and the title of 'Modern Revelation' points to metaphysical meaning. Although this film is undoubtedly inspired by 'Dark Heart', it is indeed different from European culture (German-style war alienation focuses on aesthetics, especially opera-style life impulses). American culture is more violent and emphasizes autonomy. In alienation, the sense of autonomy is particularly strong. Kurtz is regarded as a lunatic ('The colonel is a lunatic, worse than mad, a demon'), but in terms of his self-awareness when alienated, he is still a typical American. This has nothing to do with others (Vietnam in the film is an orientalized Middle Ages or even primitive society), it is about self. This sense of meaninglessness and alienation has brought about profound trauma. It has not been seen in the American war against the Indians and the subsequent war on terrorism. It is an endless void.",8,1,1,10 April 2020
The Intouchables," Don't kill in the name of good.
","A skydiving millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in an accident hired a full-time caregiver for a high salary. People around him don't understand, and his answer is: he always forgets the fact that I'm paralyzed, and that's what I want, no mercy, no special treatment, no discrimination.Two people from very different backgrounds, masters and servants, get along surprisingly well. In the middle of the night, when he was sick, he pushed him out to share a cigarette in the street. Bet together, trick the police into leading the way for speeding. Hide from all the people to go skydiving in the mountains, enjoy the conquest of looking down from the sky. He helped him break the paralysis of the inferiority complex, successfully hold the beauty back.The true story was later made into a movie that became the number one film at the French box office. Such a stereotypical story is made interesting, true, natural and touching. I thought that if the story had been set in this country, it might have been so: ill-dressed service, self-sacrifice, patient tolerance of all bad habits and bad temper. Our dictionary of the moving, is often defined in this way, into a kind of beyond human nature, the secular fearless.In this movie, however, life and death are no longer tears to be used as gimmicks. In the limited time of life, would rather the heart with my move presumptuous, also do not want to always like a dying like to ask for help to others, this is a kind of respect for life and respect. It has nothing to do with being moved, although it makes the viewer feel warmth all the time.In the second half of the movie, the millionaire doesn't want him to spend the rest of his life with a patient, so he switches to another nurse. The professional carer who was always cautious and always explained to others that he was 'sick' when there was a problem made his heart grow old every day and more and more miss the friend who played with him, accompanied him crazy and even joked about the paralytic.In this story, the glory of human nature does not lie in who made greater sacrifice for whom, but only in that you gave me the peace and dignity I wanted, and I gave you the recognition and support I wanted. Their knowledge, status and status are very different, but there is an unprecedented agreement on this point: don't use what you think of as kindness, to make the other person grateful.Every adult has a world that strangers can't easily touch, whether it's the healthy or the severely ill. It is only when they meet one another that they release a kindness mixed with joy. This kind of kindness is not kindness in the traditional sense, but to believe in and value each other's energy, to express ourselves honestly, and not to impose what we think is good on each other.Don't do evil in the name of good. That may be something too many people fail to understand. You think she needs reassurance when all she really wants is to walk through the night alone. You think he should choose the better one, so try to dissuade him, but do not know that some roads can only go on their own, some choices may be wrong but it is the heart.Our parents, our friends, there is no doubt that they are people who really care about us. But why, really to the difficult place, but to them difficult to say, even want to escape from them. Between people, only because of the good and evil view of the agreement, can be connected. Others think good, often in their own more like a burden. Others think of evil, but you think of freedom in the high.Why can they transcend the class to become the soul mate, and even after they have their own lives, still often come and go. Because they read the good in each other. More because, they see each other first as a free person with an independent personality, then as a friend. Any with affection as chip, want to control the other side personality freedom, the final outcome is bound to destroy that affection.",8,0,1,8 April 2020
Aliens," Perfect
","What a scary movie! ! James Cameron is really a great commercial director! To say he is a 'commercial' director does not mean to disparage him, because commercial films can have as much meaning as so-called art-house films. Just in theory, it gives us more sensory stimulation and more grand endings.
Let's start with the business, maybe because Ridley Scott didn't have a lot of technology when he shot the first episode, maybe because Ridley Scott preferred to create a scary atmosphere rather than specific scary scenes. Anyway, James Cameron did make the second episode a lot scarier than the first. For example, when the female pilot turns around and suddenly finds the alien sitting behind him, for example, the alien victim who suddenly opens her eyes, for example, when the little girl says in a childish voice, 'can't go now, right? 'Like the giant' alien 'that appears at the end of the movie... I'm scared to death.
Speaking of connotations, I was surprised to find that the movie has a strong feminist flavor. We saw that all the male soldiers who appeared in the movie did not survive, whether they were brave, cowardly, intelligent or stupid. Of course, two female fighters also died, which is a sign that they were too masculine, too strong, too lacking in feminine tenderness and motherhood. Our main character, Ripley, is both masculine and feminine, tender and maternal. (that little girl, Newt, is in part a reflection of Ripley's maternal nature.) After all, she's the only one who survived the alien attacks on the interstellar aliens, and she's the one who found Ripley and his gang an escape route.
Bishop, the robot who always fought bravely and ended up dying, is obviously very important to JamesCameron personally. If the robot in the first episode is the origin of all the tragedies, thus expressing that Ridley Scott, the director of the first episode, is trying to express a certain fear of modern technology, then James Cameron clearly believes that modern technology can bring people more happiness than tragedy. James Cameron has always believed this, and his film career has always been a big step along the way
He liked the ending: the survivors were returning to earth, and Ridley told Newt that he could now sleep well and not worry about nightmares. At this point, the once full of horror atmosphere is no longer exist, leaving us only a calm and peaceful atmosphere, and of course, a sense of security",7,0,2,16 April 2020

Gone with the Wind," Love in troubled times
","Sometimes love needs to be held on and beaten, but once love has bound the wings of the lover, please let it go as soon as possible.
Scarlett, do you think it's worth hurting someone who loves you for someone who has hurt you before? Vanity is a part of all human beings, but it's important to get out of it and not wait for what you really need to lose before you can appreciate it. So always ask yourself: are you doing what you really need right now? You are successful, but do you consider yourself happy?
Rhett, I think you've done all you have to do. Including the dedication to the cause, the 'implicit' loyalty to the south, the unswerving pursuit of lovers, the meticulous love of the daughter. Though you knew that the south had lost the battle before it was fought, and though you and most southerners could not appear to share in it, you fought for the south everywhere during the war. You fought with millions of southerners, and when the battle was won, you left your loved ones behind and joined the confederate army. For the love, for the daughter, changed a man, a father can change everything.
You're a shrewd businessman, but you can't calculate your feelings. I think this you know, feelings sometimes need to be confused, so you rarely care about scarlett, everything for the sake of the girl. And once the daughter died, all the sustenance and hope also die. At this time you have nearly collapsed, is mei lanli, the woman you admire most, let you walk out of the bedroom again, to life. But when you know that the woman who gave everything for it has never loved you, but still loves ASHLEY, and married herself only for the poor three hundred dollars. You may be unbearable, so choose to leave, leave that only sad and tragic place, leave that will only make their own shame and pain scarlett.
However, leaving will only let you get a temporary adjustment and comfort, not for a long time joy and happiness, because after all you still like, love scarlett, leaving her will only be painful, not happy. It is better to get back together and create happiness for both of us than to cause pain for both of us if one of us leaves. Scarlett has completely come to her senses, so give her another chance, and also give yourself another chance to be happy, and go back to tara and scarlett again! After all, tomorrow is another day. Mei lanli, 'exhaling such as LAN, xinfang such as hui' so describe you again appropriate however. You have the noblest character in the human race -- kindness, the most appealing quality in a man -- tenderness. You are wise and virtuous, know how to write, gentle and kind... You possess almost all the good qualities of man, so that my clumsy pen cannot describe them. But ASHLEY doesn't really love you. But...
ASHLEY, you may be a gentleman, your noble temperament attracted many obsessed with fantasy girls, including scarlett, I do not know what thing is your body captured scarlett's soul. Let's not say your marriage and mei lanli is happy, you and the feelings between mei lanli is not love. Perhaps you have only one kind of dependence and sustenance on mei LAN li. But as a man should never take life on others like you, especially on a woman (no matter how good she is), can't say you have no definite view, but you are weak, you are too too complacent, so that lose the power to change the status quo, the satisfaction of the abnormal gradually eroding your desire to do better. If you want to achieve anything, you must be independent, especially in spirit. If you want to make progress, you must have an endless stream of new goals, and work hard for them. You must be strong. Tragedy happens because of human nature.
'Gone with the wind' is the youth of scarlett's generation, the kind of picnic and dance life; It is the 'ideal' of the southern plantation-style aristocracy, and the arrogant, blind and ignorant southerners.

In his ugly but hidden under the mask of a noble heart, his 'who is under my appearance is not important, important is I do' (It's not who I am underneath, but It 's what I do that defines me) runs through the whole mystery of batman 5 XiaYing, let us see as a man of a little helpless. If we want to use the analogy of the characters in jin yong's martial arts novels, superman is just like the virtual bamboo that has unwittingly acquired good martial arts skills. Their common characteristics are kindness and simple thinking. It is so natural for superman to deal with the evil people just as the virtual bamboo deals with ding chunqiu. And the sadness of batman is reminiscent of xiao feng, xiao feng wrong hand killed the love of a lifetime, batman also lost his favorite woman because of his wrong judgment (' batman 6 dark knight '), they are also misunderstood by the world, abandoned, but always do without shame, let a person respect.Although superman is not a person, it is called superman. Batman is a person, but is called xia.5. Superman always protects the world peace within the scope of his ability, while batman is fighting with the enemy with flesh and blood, and may pay the price of life at any time. I would rather believe that superman belongs to the same category as the gods and ultraman in ancient Greek mythology, and that batman is the real hero, because he is a human being like us.6. Although superman and batman are always presented as dual identities, both roles (journalist and superman) are much more relaxed than batman, who disguizes himself as a playboy during the day, plays the devil at night to fight evil forces, and is constantly confronted by Gotham police. In the end, batman even sacrificed his reputation, took all the crimes on his own shoulders, and completely became a weirdo (' batman 6 dark knight '). This kind of self-sacrifice spirit is also what superman does not have.7. Although batman and superman share a common habit of passing on his underwear, batman's nocturnal habits are kept to a minimum, but children all over the world look up to superman as he flies.",7,0,0,30 April 2020

Lawrence of Arabia," Lawrence's Dream
","It was undoubtedly one of the films that had a huge impact on me, and I have to say that Lawrence's fate is still one of the most important frames of reference for me to find myself.In the film, Lawrence's life in the Arab world during this period was full of ambition, high spirits and boundless scenery. Although he experienced ups and downs several times, it ended up in frustration and grief. Perhaps because of the director's realist tendencies, or perhaps because of the length of the film, it is not clear why Lawrence was so interested in the Arab world, and the motives of several big ups and downs, which has become the focus of Lawrence's puzzlement. To my mind, all of that is rooted in the idealism that runs in Lawrence's blood. In other words, in the depths of Lawrence's soul, there were several dreams floating around.Dream one: to be born. Why do you like this desert? Lawrence: clean. Yes, compared to the secular world in which they live, there is a cleaner place than the sand rolling desert?Dream two: universal salvation. In the film, Lawrence has a distinctive personality. When he first met the new governor after he captured akaba, the new governor made a brief summary of Lawrence before he came to the Arab world: 'no self-discipline, no punctuality, several languages, music, literature, knowledge...' . It can be seen that Lawrence was a talented, rebellious and independent man. The film is also heavy on Lawrence's extremely kind and benevolent character. Because of his outstanding talent, he is full of ambition; Because of his rebellion, he was critical of all the seemingly impregnable realities. Because of his kindness, he has universal compassion; Perhaps only such a man, seeing a divided, benighted Arab world, would naturally produce the great dream of a united Arab world and a free Arab people.Dream # 3: chasing your own existence. 'Who am I? It should be the question that Lawrence pursued all his life. The trajectory of Lawrence's personal development is never mentioned in the film, but Lawrence is confronted several times with whether he is British or Arab or someone else. In this quest, there are two images that make people feel sad. One is the first time Lawrence wears an Arabic turban on his head and hops around the desert in his traditional Arab costume. Scene 2: Lawrence lifts up his shirt and points at his skin, then shouts at ali, 'see, I'm white! You can never change that!' The large Arab clothing once let him think he found his own place, but, the white skin will he mercilessly drove away from their pursuit of home for years. Perhaps the search for himself had been Lawrence's most distant dream.Dream 4: pursue your own perfection. Defects, whether external or internal, were perhaps the last thing Lawrence himself wanted to be discovered. Even in his voluminous abaya, Lawrence remained elegant. When such grace was trampled upon by the Turkish soldiers, Lawrence's faith collapsed: his own compassion, his own dignity in the face of the ruthless reality is just a dream! I would rather Lawrence had never actually walked into the endless desert at the moment of his mad revenge for the slaughter of Turkey.The beauty of the dream may be in its faint come true, however, the dream will eventually wake up one day, idealism in the end can not resist the reality of the existence of a light blow. Your life goes on, you still exist in this secular world; You were born in England, and you will return to rest in England; Your wit and bravery are boundless, but the unspeakable antiquity and mystery of the Arab world has far exceeded your wisdom. After waking up, you are bound to be helpless and sad, you can not escape as a person with the same fate.If all these dreams seem bleak and capricious, does Lawrence leave no warm eternity in the sand? Although there is no mention of Lawrence's emotional world in the film, there are a lot of rumors about Lawrence outside the film, especially his famous poem 'to S' in 'the seven pillars of wisdom'. The preface to 'A' may presage his fifth, more obscure dream.",8,0,0,26 April 2020

Avengers: Infinity War," This is what a group play should be.
","It is recommended that you drink less water, because this is almost a zero point movie, nearly two and a half hours from beginning to end. A few places do not play, or the place that the rhythm is more gentle has before and after looking after, is not idle pen.Although there are a lot of violent scenes, there are also plenty of funny points, and all kinds of jokes are everywhere, forming a buffer between the endless fierce battles. (although I'm not happy with the Internet slang used in the subtitles) and iron man is as mean and fart as ever, the captain of the solemn veteran + commissioner, brother hammer that pose is show MOE, there is a reference to the original black widow sister and hawkeye relationship, and finally see a brain of Dr. Banner. As an adaptation, there are many things to please comic fans, including classic lines.Original characters like agent colson are also great (my favorite in the whole series). His final performance may feel a little bit overrated, but for him, it's actually dark in his belly, so deep in his consciousness that all he can think about is how to make the most of the situation.Although it draws a lot of elements from the ultimate universe, including the characters' costumes and the names of alien RACES, the movie is not the world view of the ultimate universe. It seems to be a mix of the main world and the ultimate world. Loki says that he has an army, and that the aliens are really tough hybrid soldiers without any of the machismo of the original, but the post-credits Easter egg reveals that the really tough guys are still out there.As a group of heroes, the film is thoughtful: each character has enough to show for their character and ability, and the interaction between them is interesting. Avengers protagonist, is a team. The growth of the protagonist, here is the team of the run-in. See them from each other pk (this pk has a tribute to the original reason), to two cooperation, and then to the overall cooperation, the context and rhythm are very clear.Unlike the x-men, which are dominated by young students, the avengers are established heroes. So the movie borrows entirely from the comic book model of the year -- starting with the individual story of each member and then the origins of the team.Marvel had previously used five feature films plus two shorts as a starting point. Therefore, it does not need to explain the history and background of each person in detail in the film, but only carries out the 'simplest' explanation, showing the core characteristics of each character. (the better part is showing another aspect of the hulk, Bruce banner as a famous scientist, which the hulk lacks.) This spare time is all focused on the core events, so the film can climax, burning the sky.This is a good example of how to make a team of heroes, but can this model be copied? Who could have done ten hours of foreplay for a movie that always had an orgasm?
(I saw this film, dc pressure is very big, I hope one or two films against the sky, after all, it is not as good as M's solid accumulation of six years)",8,1,2,12 April 2020
Django Unchained," if you insite
","Django thought the dentist was not a good man, because the dentist told him to kill his father in front of the children, even though it was a damned villain. In that treacherous society, being a bounty hunter, a high-risk profession, makes it impossible to be a good person.
For much of the first half of the film, the German dentist is clever, cunning and bold, and always manages to ride out the next nasty situation, until he meets leonardo.
Laolai is a crafty, ruthless slave owner businessman, living in the slave owner family, he has become cruel and numb, he adapted to the environment of the game rules, and play well, because he also has his own principles.
Laolai won the match. The process is quite wonderful, and the old Lena perfect acting, but also the slave owners and businessmen's treacherous merciless portrayal into three points.
So far, both sides are playing by the rules, although there is a lot of money in the wallet, laolai only took the deserved 12K, he is more enjoy the victory. The dentist, who was the loser, also accepted the defeat with ease.
Then comes the climax of the movie, which is the most thought-provoking part of the whole movie. Laolais prided himself on being a winner, lavishly treating the dentist to cake and letting the musicians play Beethoven's 'to Alice', showing the winner's grace and respect for his opponent. Hearing the tune, the dentist was lost in thought, and the image of the gladiator named d 'addario being torn apart by a vicious dog came to mind. Beethoven and dumas were both pioneers of freedom and equality. ! D 'addario's name as gladiator is an insult to dumas.
A wave of grief and resentment rose up in the dentist's mind, and the disgust made him decide to distance himself from laolai -- sorry, I'm not your type. So he stopped the musician from playing and angrily went into the study. Feeling angry that the dentist had lost the duel, laolai went into his study to console him so that he could enjoy the satisfaction of winning. But he was wrong. In his own eyes, the dentist was a sore loser, and in the eyes of the dentist, he was a dirty winner.
Laolai angry, everyone in accordance with the rules of the game to play this game, as the winner, I already respect you, with what you can't give me respect? So he insisted that the dentist shake hands to complete the deal.
As the dentist reached for the steps, I thought for a moment that he was going to cave. But he could not resist the question of principle.
Would I have fired the shot? I don't know. Probably not. Admire him! Then a burst of light sadness, for their own gradually lost blood.

The Lives of Others," Reality is more cruel than movies.
","For all The praise The world has heaped on 'The lives of others,' if anyone must jump up and say that 'The lives of others' is a failure, it is probably The director of The former east German prison museum. Without the curator, however, the film's most important significance would not have emerged. This is a movie that must be seen in contrast, and only when you compare historical facts with the film can you still sit still, speechless and shocked after watching the movie, and understand the true cruelty.
The story is set in 1984 - not a year of choice for anyone who has read George Orwell's political fable 1984 - when the loyal and ruthless east German secret police, wiesler, after watching a play, offers to spy on the playwright derriman. Weisler's request coincides with that of the minister of culture, who has his eye on the beautiful actress krista, derriman's wife, in an attempt to find dirt through surveillance and coerce krista into satisfying his own desires. Weisler's psychology and motives are much more complex. On the one hand, he finds deraman 'suspicious' because of the secret police's fearsome omnipresent sense of smell.
Weisler and another secret police officer alternated shifts to monitor the dreymans around the clock. What weisler did not expect, however, was that his humanity gradually recovered during the eavesdropping. He took a volume of brackett's poetry with him from the playwright's desk and was deeply moved by it; He burst into tears when he heard deraman's emotional piano playing on the monitor. Just as derriman began secretly and anonymously writing reports to the west German media about east German suicides, weisler chose to sacrifice his career to protect them. He sends off another police officer on duty, a man who listens in on the dreymans and fabricates surveillance reports, and ends up helping the playwright avoid a huge disaster in the middle of a crisis. Weisler was demoted to the basement as a messenger boy, and after the change, he still lived at the bottom of the social ladder as a messenger delivering free ads.
'The lives of others' swept The German awards, winning best European film, actor of The year and screenwriter of The year, and winning The Oscar for best foreign language film. Indeed, it has all the elements that the oscars love: east Germany, suspense, the resurgence of humanity, the triumph of good over evil... All in all, the story of a killer in love, an east German version of Leon, the American genre. But is this really the case? Of course, it's fair to say that weisler, who at first seems as cold as steel, is too quick and easy to turn his humanity around, and that the film's treatment of this point seems to be less than rigorous, but is it just that?
Donashmark, director and screenwriter, has been making his feature film debut at the age of 33, the lives of others, after nine years of preparation. When the film was shot, he got the help of many former east germans, and was able to film in many of the former east German government buildings. The only person who turned down his request was the director of the former east German prison museum. Why? Because, says the curator, the play is historically incorrect: throughout east German history, there were no 'conscience-conscious' secret police like Mr Wiesler, sorry, none.
Yes, this is the truth of the matter, this is the most significant and powerful shock that it reveals: that the killer is not emotional, that humanity is not revived, that good does not triumph over evil. Donashmark said he wanted to show people back then that you have a choice. The truth is, no one chooses conscience. The warmer the movie, the harsher the reality. Donashmark is still too young and naive. He should have finished the film with the subtitles and told the audience that this tenderness never existed, this wish never came true. In this way, the film is complete, just, enough.",9,0,0,11 April 2020

If I ask you about women, you can tell me all about them. You may have slept with them a few times, but you can't tell me how much joy you felt when you woke up next to a woman. You are young and strong, and if I talk to you about the war, you will throw Shakespeare at me and recite 'to the field, my dear friend,' but you have never been in the field, never tried to hold your friend's head in your arms and watch him take his last breath, staring at you and asking for your help.

Room," you and me aginst the world
","The first half of the film, I believe that all the audience, like me, for the mother and child can escapes to knead a cold sweat, and when their plan see will successfully, my in the mind also began to have a faint concerns, Jack's outlook on life world outlook is very narrow, although the mother as much as possible to ensure his health, vitamin, narrow space or let him sport!), but the psychological? His world was the distance from a hut to a skylight. How could he survive when he came out of the trap and saw the real birds, the blue sky, all kinds of people, exposed to the bacteria of the air and the complexity of human nature?However, I never expected that, although Jack began to have trouble fitting in, as a child, he soon learned everything, learned to contact and care for the grandparents he just met, learned to be strong and independent, and made friends of the same age. Instead, the mother collapsed in the face of everything lost and recovered and the pressure of public opinion. Why?There is a plot that I think is very well designed. Joy is showing Jack a picture of her with her friends when she was a student, and she says, 'do you know what happened to them?' Jack says no, Joy says exactly, nothing happened, and then she has a fight with her mother and even blames her for what happened to her. She is dumbstruck by the host's questions on the talk show, and finally fails to commit suicide by taking drugs. This is a very clear expression of her psychological process. Joy was only a girl when she was cheated and imprisoned. From the swing set behind her grandparents' house that she had been telling Jack about, it can be seen that she grew up in a harmonious family environment and was a good girl who was healthy and had no bad habits and was willing to help others. Maybe she had never experienced a real love heartbreak. When a person is suppressed in a few meters square room, she thought only how to escape, and when the real escape, she began to lose the seven years of heartache, is much transformed, parents are not together, that of his friends about also have their own family business, and she is just one of the world's most insignificant a single particle, didn't she, on the earth is still in turn, others are still in the forward, live a life, only oneself, and this world all contact solidification in seven years ago, out of place. There is only one achievement, and the seven years has brought up Jack lived alone with yourself, so when the host asked you have never thought in the Jack was born Old Nick put him in the fire department or hospital to let him have a real childhood, this is the last straw breaks the camel's, she's the only meaning there seven years were rejected, she the meaning of survival and life values must be collapsed. However, he was saved by his son Jack, who cut short his long hair and integrated into the society. However, he still kept the pure heart of being dependent on his mother.I believe that in the end, the mother and son returned to the room, where many people were in tears. At first, I thought the plot design was a little abrupt. Why should I go back to the place where I was imprisoned? After watching it, I wanted to ask the screenwriter to take my knee. I felt that the last scene cleared away the haze and heartache that the whole movie had brought to the audience. Suddenly, I realized that the film was not about how to escape, but how to make peace with the heavy past and finally move forward with hope. Some people may think the latter part is too much chicken soup, but I think in the treatment of the mother and son relationship, this degree of soft chicken soup I am still very willing to drink it, after all, did not cry to tell my mother to love me again, but is gentle and romantic, directly to the heart.If there really is a mother and son in some corner of the world or in some parallel universe, I would like to send my blessing to you, whether in a small room or in a big world, I hope you two can stay together, you and me agianst the world.",7,0,0,13 May 2020

Schindler's List," The weight of life! To save one person is to save the world!
","There was so much in this three-hour movie that really stuck in my head, in my bones.We've all seen a lot of movies about world war ii, but if we had to pick the most memorable, schindler's list would be on the list. This is a magnificent movie, in this movie, I can strongly feel the weight of life! To save one person is to save the world!In the whole film, the most striking thing for me is not the tragic scene of burning bodies, nor the panic and despair in the gas chamber, but a relatively ordinary morning. This morning, a group of poor jews were working like cattle and horses on the electricity grid in a German district. And the governor of the precinct, goff?He was standing bare-chested on the balcony outside his bedroom, hunched over the jews he commanded. In the bedroom behind him, his girl was fast asleep. After stretching his muscles, goff strolled back to the house and picked up a sniper rifle, aimed it at the slightly slower jews in the distance, and killed them all. He cocked his head, a cigarette in his mouth, and his expression was calm.Each shot disturbed goff's sleep. She tried all she could to keep her ears out of the noise, but it failed, and she was miserable -- miserable because the noise disturbed her sleep. It was not an emergency, but part of their daily lives. The killing no longer had any excitement in their minds, and this unusual event was considered the norm. This, I feel, is a hundred times more evil than the killing itself.Where there is war, there are heroes. Life in the camp was as cheap as cattle, trampled on at will. The plight of the jews is deplorable, and the bitter cost of the war unbearable. Human nature is confused in the war. As schindler said, war always highlights the ugly side of human nature. We also see the Nazi soldiers' disregard for life and wanton killing of innocent polish jews.Fortunately, we also see that the merciless nature of the war brings out the best in schindler. He was the representative of the cold - blooded capitalist who made a huge amount of money in the war with his clever brain and cheap labor. But he was a man of conscience, who saved the jews again and again and brought them to his refuge.At the end of the film, when I received the gold ring of surviving jews sent to him, on the Hebrew: save a person, is to save a world, the collapse of Mr Schindler mood, since always thought I have done good justice success also lost to weak and frustration, he said, pointing to their own cars, said it can and Goethe officers in 10 people, pointing to his own brooch, said that in 2 people, even more.He was in tears, complaining that he had not worked hard enough to make more money, and that he had been able to save just over 1,100 jews. That scene really moved me. Before losing his fortune and going on the road to exile, Mr. Schindler finally fully showed his greatness and, I am sure, his great love for all innocent human beings.At that moment, I really want to cry. The truly great are never proud of their merits, but still review their shortcomings as a sin. In fact, Mr. Schindler was, as the ring aptly said, the brightest light of the darkest days. Each name on schindler's list is the weight of life!",8,0,1,22 March 2020
Schindler's List," A list of the best
","At first, I learned about the movie from the director's teacher, and at that time, I thought it was called 'Hitler' list. Strong curiosity drove me to download the movie. I was originally not interested in such overly profound films, but I couldn't help but watch the director spielberg's great fame. It has to be said that such art-house films about human nature in the context of war abroad, although they often take nearly three hours, are not boring at all.
The film's black-and-white images give a sense of historical vicissitudes, creating a documentary-like atmosphere. The main theme of the film is peace and redemption, which clearly shows the transformation of a German arms dealer named schindler from his greed for personal gain at the beginning to his sincere desire to save every Jew persecuted by the German nazis.
The war has brought death and fear to every corner of the world. Those ruling parties are willing to wage war in order to safeguard their own interests, totally regardless of the lives of the people. War distorts human nature, but it also shows the good side of human nature. Under Hitler's leadership, the nazis developed a hubristic sense of racial superiority in which they saw the jews as animals with no human rights.
They raised their butcher's knife to kill innocent jewish people, they used a ruthless face to the fascist brutality of take in everything in a glance, I can't forget those who hid in the floor to avoid the nazis came for the wardrobe and under the bed, trembling of women and children forget German soldiers in found that after surviving jews rushing a leave their guns, a gentleman's officers sitting in the elegant piano of fiddling with the keys of the jews, like Mozart's music is accompanied by the way, like punctured beans gunfire as dance music is a god of death. The director satirizes the Nazi's cruelty and perversion in a seemingly absurd way.
When schindler and his wife rode up the hill and witnessed the beastly behavior of the German soldiers who were massacring innocent jews in the city, and when he saw the little girl in red running in a panic in the chaos of the crowd, he was enlightened by his inner goodness. He understood that, in this troubled world, even if earn more money can not buy the living human life, no human nature, even if there is no amount of wealth is just a walking corpse. There are plenty of details about schindler's transformation, such as the way he began to use his connections to get a lifeline for the jewish workers at the factory, and the way he treated the jewish women at his birthday party with full respect by passionately kissing them regardless of the eyes of others. The contrast with schindler is that of the Nazi lieutenant, whose air of militarism and fascism cannot be concealed. Even though he is elegant in front of outsiders, his loneliness is revealed when he meets Helen, a jewish woman. He didn't kill Helen. Maybe he needed someone to comfort him. He may not really like Helen, just want to have someone to express his feelings, but his inner racism is already in his
There is a deep and indelible imprint on the soul. When schindler exhorted him to try to forgive others, I seemed to see a silver lining in him, and he seemed to shake a little at that moment in his own soul about what he believed in. When he caresses Helen in the basement as a maid, he is infatuated with her beauty, but can not express his love for her, because he is a German Nazi officer, his identity and beliefs make him helpless. His inner contradictions make him irate, fascist thoughts take over his soul again, he madly beats poor Helen, and the director USES a parallel montage to contrast schindler's kindness to jews at the party with his perversion. This is perhaps the director of war warped human another way of saying.
When wrapping film, schindler met German soldiers dug up the bodies of those in the concentration camps were slaughtered, the audience was surprised that the figure of a wearing a red dress sitting in a pile of dead bodies for cremation, the little girl's body already decay, schindler did not think of a child can't escape from fate, due to the particularity of color film, director of the little girl's figure used alone and local color, which have a certain impact on the vision. In the black and white of the body, the red is very dazzling, in this dark age, the child is buried by the ruthless killing, hope is destroyed in an instant.
Schindler understood the meaning of the list and what he was supposed to do. He didn't want to eat or sleep, he just wanted to save one more person. This reminds us of the businessman schindler at the beginning of the film, who only wanted to make money from the war but didn't care about the lives of the jewish people. It turns out that a person can change, and the jews let schindler complete a self-redemption. Let him understand save a life, is to save the truth of the world.
The film can be described as a memoir by spielberg himself, who is a Jew. He deeply criticizes the distortion of human nature caused by the war, and at the same time praises the humanity that has not been lost in the war.

Why does the person who contradicts the doctor begin with, 'you and your elephant man?' Is not John himself, he was 'like a man' label on the champions league, and this label is posted on his face. The hands, body, is obvious. He need to cling to, a person is not his own is does not have its own role in the society, so he is the boss of the circus, he is a doctor, he is just an attachment, a property, a clown.
John was admitted to the hospital through the mercy of the doctor, the stage moved from the circus to the hospital, and the audience moved from the third class to the first class. In stage plays, like a person can't see myself, so you can't see the mirror, he can't face myself, 'he is like a mirror', however, he is always ready to appreciate other people, 'you are beautiful', 'crutch is very good-looking,' people find affirmation of the self through to his mercy, 'look at this poor man, so alive, I can be a lot better',
Ironically, however, is so ugly appearance of John, in faith, in 21 years to recite the bible, is at the top of the house just looked down at the cathedral to sincerely to build up to the church, his spirit was not tainted by the reality, he have no hatred, he is just with gratitude, he always say thank you, for all the damage, no hate.
Finally found it, he said he felt himself, he finally don't have to hide in a dark place, finally is not like a person, but to a man called John. He built a church, 'said the' end ', as if all his desire, not caring. His wish, is no longer a symbol, is no longer like a person, he is just an ordinary man, he knows that he is not the ordinary people, also is unable to be ordinary people, he can't through the normal sleep and to prove himself, but he finally completed the wish, too. So, as human being's heart, he need not to think he is like a person, he finally like personal living, like a So the story of man is over, and he is not finished as a man, just like so many other people, the day is eternal.",7,0,0,11 May 2020

1917," About absurdity and courage.
","After reading '1917,' I thought of a lot of things. Because of the exchange and work, I have more opportunities to stop and go in the UK. From Oxford with its colleges to bath with its tourists, to the streets and corners of London, from Edinburgh with its elegance to inverness with its desolation, one does not have to look far to see monuments, statues or parks commemorating the first world war -- more than 43, 000, I am told.From the summer of 1914 to the winter of 1918, more than 900,000 young britons died in foreign wars. Nobles and plebs, college students and apprentices, volunteers and draftees, however different their identities and life experiences, all ended up as strings of Arabic numerals and English letters on a stone. This is absurd, but even more so is the war.The first is the lack of meaning. The so-called world war is the avarice of the Allies, the ambition of the Allies no side, a brush fire, Europe bombed. Being a soldier may be cannon fodder, but in the end you have to aim for something. When Europe's bones have withered, except for the United States and Japan two white-eyed wolves, who did not see a successful war. 'Imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism', but what millions of europeans paid to die for it seems neither empire nor capital. The last four emperors lost their empire, many capitalists lost their wealth, and countless workers lost their homes. This is ridiculous.Then there is the lack of baseline. All wars are inhuman, but in the past man was still like a master of war. From the beginning of the war, people became slaves to the war. To shape the humanism of modern Europe is to turn people into ground rats and jam them into trenches, spending the whole day in darkness with the opposite side. The reason brought about by the enlightenment is to stuff the meat grinder with all kinds of materials that command people to become regular. The two industrial revolutions were marked by more powerful machines, more powerful artillery, more insidious mines and chemical weapons of endless variety: mustard gas, chlorine gas, phosphorescence, benzyl bromide... This is ridiculous.So it's easy to see why there are so many great war movies about world war ii and so few about world war I. In world war ii, the United States saved the world, the Soviet union won the respect, Britain and France continued the war, the Chinese shaped the concept of a modern nation with their flesh and blood, countless small countries gained their independence, jews found their homes, Germany and Japan ushered in a transformation... Soldiers dying in battle, either with the will to fight against the axis of evil, or with the conviction to create a new world, no matter how low, have the consciousness to die for the sake of the imperial movement or national glory, these are the highlights that can be made into a movie. And the young men who died absurdly for absurd ends in the first world war? A bunch of dead ghosts?But the monuments to the first world war, all over Britain, seemed to tell me otherwise. When I walked the western front with corporal scofield on the days and nights of '1917' with Roger dickins' long shot to the end, I was more convinced that it wasn't.When Blake pulls him to the task of delivering the letter, he immediately questions the danger. He worries about walking through no man's land during the day and complains about why his comrades take him with them. Unlike Blake, he doesn't have a brother to save, and he hates war. His skill was not good, his brain was not brilliant, and being in a foreign country had left him black and blue from repeated misadventures. This character setting, combined with the shooting technique of the film's long shot, gave me a strong sense of substitution, as if I was sent to the front, the extraordinary play is almost so. But then I began to doubt their own willpower, the movie atmosphere is tense, I and the corporal's perspective is the same, do not know where the danger is hidden, ghost territory like no man's land, the sniper in the ruins, in the dark in close combat, burning streets in the chase... I suspect I may have had a nervous breakdown at some point.But in order to complete his comrades' instructions and save more compatriots, corporal scofield finally chose to go forward. In the ruins, the ruins, the swamps, the rivers, the trenches, the bayonets, the artillery, he knew he had to give the letter to a fellow named captain Mackenzie to stop the attack. This was his task, and the whole point of his existence in that day and night. He shouted to his comrades to push the truck, braved bullets alone to cross the broken bridge, fought desperately with poor marksman and the enemy in the attic, strangled the enemy clumsily in the dark, and ran in a panic, swam across the river of corpses, squeezed through the trenches, and ran to the front... I even felt like I was watching forrest gump, but corporal scofield, by this time, had really changed from the beginning of the film, and he had acquired a courage that was not his own but that he had to carry.At the end of the movie, he completes the task, even though the task itself is absurd. First, as McKinsey put it, they sent soldiers today to stop the offensive, and soon one or two more to tell us to charge at dawn that the only way this war could end was if 'the last man died.' Second, the corporal may have saved 1,600 lives in Devon in the spring, but in the following summer more than 300,000 British soldiers would die on the western front, probably everyone he saved and himself, while the Allies' front would have advanced by a few miles. Second, almost everyone except the commander in chief would question whether such a dangerous mission could be carried out by just two soldiers. However, in the age of lack of communication technology, the meaning of these big soldiers is to 'send a message to the chief'. The lives of one or two people are probably worth only so much.I think the director was aware of this absurdity, and there are many scenes in the film that show the cruelty and even the nothingness of the war. What impressed me most was the same white cherry blossoms as Blake's hometown. The water glistened blue, and at the end of its petals, there were pale, mutilated bodies covered with bubbles. In this sense, I think the director's failure to arrange the mission (such as arriving at the front where everyone is already charging) is probably more shocking.If war is the continuation of creatures' plunder of living space and resources in the nature, and the ultimate destiny that human beings, as a kind of creatures, cannot escape, then the various values that human beings have practiced by burning life in the war are the unique proof of human species. 'Tragedy is the destruction of the valuable things of life to people to see', the war itself is a tragedy, and even in a meaningless war like the first world war, even if the two soldiers finally gained nothing, I still see the crown of thorns of the human spirit in their heads, that is, the courage that is huge to have exceeded individual life. The lions face the flock and go away in silence; And in the face of the devil of war, even more terrible than the devil of the absurd fate of death, there may still be 'I go' consciousness.The monuments of England, like the innumerable nameless war memorials, graves, and tombs of mankind through all ages, are affectionate tributes, silent indictments, and indomitable cries against fate.",9,0,3,17 April 2020
Grave of the Fireflies," disappointment
","Grave of the fireflies was such a disappointment to me.
At the beginning, I ran into a big question mark, the air raid alarm has sounded, other families are terrified like a dog to run to the shelter, how the mother of two children still so calmly command the child buried soft? It would make sense to say this was for the future, but why didn't she go to the shelter? Why didn't she take her daughter and make it easier for her son to run for his life? Yes, she's a sick woman, and she may not be able to carry a child, but that brings us back to the original question, why didn't she leave for the shelter earlier? Is it not safe, and easy to lead the daughter, so that the son more relaxed? I really want to break my head. Her death, caused by her unwise action, was the beginning of the tragedy.
The second question is, are the siblings cute? I saw nothing of their loveliness, only two unlikable children of a high officer's family, well-fed, unreasonable, and unsociable. Sister is still small, don't say what, brother? With a sister living in aunt home, it gave people a lot of trouble in itself - and, of course, their aunt seemed inclined to selling off their stuff, but I think this is excusable, after all, they are free to live, and wartime life is generally nervous - and he seems to be sleeping in addition to eat, is to accompany my sister to play, both don't want to go out to work to earn money, also not for aunt do household chores, and dissatisfaction with aunt in its sensitive, not much skill, also kill big temper. Someone said it was their aunt's fault. It was her fault. I don't think so. Admittedly, aunt let them drink soup, but to her husband and children eat rice, but we can't be ignored is that she also drink soup, eat rice crust and in brush pot, suggesting that their hard times, as not doing any work doesn't do housework, drink soup for granted, and when they cook, even not in time to wash dishes, or the aunt wash in the middle of the night, and it is important to note that the largest fire, aunt is happened after washing the dishes, it's understandable to angry words, or impulse. Not only that, but we still can push through some subtle aspects of thought, at the time of the brother and sister's mother is alive, that is to say, their life is very comfortable, they did not give any relatives to help, as can be seen from the two points, one is their aunt to see the boy in surprise after digging in the ruins of the items, the second is boy doesn't know any relatives address. That is to say, while they live a pampered life, there is no help or allowance for relatives, even close relatives like aunts.
The third is, does the brother really love his sister? The question was not directed at emotion, but at reason. He loved his sister, there was no doubt about it, but was he rational? In the aunt's home, although to look at the eyes, but after all can live with day, moreover, although there is a reaction to this kind of repression sister, but still only in the dislike level, after all, she is a child, so this grievance is basically borne by the brother, that is to say, he can endure, no problem. But he chose not to bear, resolutely left with his sister. There's nothing wrong with leaving, but what happens after? All we saw was that he kept changing his mother's things for food and drink, and never thought of doing anything to make a living. He waited until his sister was seriously ill, and then went up to the mountain to cut wood to sell. The boy, who looked like a man, was in fact quite useless, as could be seen from his reaction to the news of his father's death. Why he had never thought of earning his own living, and why he seemed to muddle along, because he had pinned his hopes on his father's return from the war! He had never thought of living on his own; it was the fault of the well-to-do, the proud. We should see that when they moved out, aunt is actually very contradictory, and more inclined to let them stay, which proves that she is not a completely ruthless person, if I, I would not like such a young gentleman and young lady living in my house. If the brother really for the sake of the sister, should suffer some injustice, stay in aunt's home, try to behave better, let aunt home satisfaction. We should see that this family is not exclusive to them, uncle seems to be indispensable, cousin or very sympathetic to them.

Singin' in the Rain," A classic of musical films
","It is said to be a classic musical film in film history. It was made in 1952, when other countries were rebuilding from the ruins.(perhaps only the United States could have been so happy to be singing and dancing after the war in the faith of its idealism.)The film began when Arthur Freed, a MGM producer, wanted to 'recycle' some old songs, so he asked two of his writers to string them together into a story, and Gene Kelly agreed to perform. As these old songs happened to be in the 2030s, they were set in the period when the silent films were transformed into sound films, vividly depicting all kinds of interesting things in the studio. It is said that people often come to their sets to share their memories of that period. They also examined in detail the costumes and equipment of the Hollywood stars.For me, the song and dance were a bit long, distracting memories of high school cheerleading practices; That kind of Cinderella storyline often makes me think the heroes and heroines are like barbie and Kenny (or shrek 2's Prince Charming). What attracts me most is the details of those early studio shooting. In the film, you can see a lot of props, equipment and lights in the studio. You can also see the rehearsals, the movements of the stunt actors, the dubbing to the mouth and the way of early radio.Singin' in the Rain, which is classed as a backstage musical, is a way for viewers to see things backstage in the form of a show. The main character in the play is set to be the main character in the movie, so you can see the production process and shooting effects (especially the sound) of the movie. The film talks about the nature and meaning of film media itself with ease, touching on the boundary between truth and fiction (ex: what the hero says at the beginning is not consistent with the truth presented in the picture, the heroine speaks out her doubts about the performance of the movie, the hero's best friend makes me Laugh to defend the entertainment of the movie, etc.). Through the process of making the film to highlight that this is a 'film about film'.It has been said that 'a film about a film' is a subject that masters and writers and directors only touch upon, and that is a serious salute and question to the film. I don't really know the definition or the depth of it, but I think Singin' in the Rain is often a very clever way to play with the fun of the real versus the real, singing and dancing and having fun. It's a lot more approachable than tsai ming-liang's 'don't go anywhere,' fellini's 'eight and a half' or chu fu's 'Day for night.'Singin' in the Rain, with its love story as the first sugar coating, and the package of wonderful songs and dances, has become a commercial selling point, but in addition to that, it has many interesting aspects and exquisite details, which make it famous in history, popular and popular.In the rain nest at home looking at the wonderful dance to listen to the melodious song, just like the appreciation of the Disney cartoon do not have to worry, there is a natural optimism: evil will overcome the right, the difficulties will eventually overcome, the discrete will also be reunited, love, cause success.(this film is suitable for every tired night, to soothe the reality of cynicism, hypnosis to sleep.)",9,0,0,24 April 2020

Our world is too impetuous, impetuous to no heart to seriously manage a life - long relationship.However the reality that we say on the lips can not cover up however the longing of heart to everlasting and everlasting, that kind of holding hands and children together in the day after day years of the warmth of the precipitation down bit by bit.

I want our house to be rooted in Paradise Fall, the place you've always wanted to go, and I want to help you fulfill your childhood aspirations.
But when I finally got to the place you've always wanted to be, I found out that since you met me, your adventure ended up with me for life.
Thank you for the life-long adventure.See here, tears streaming down my face.We do not need another irrelevant person to practice love, we do not need to follow the outside impetuous to toss about love, we do not need a dare not long for the everlasting person to spend our love. It's not love.I met you in a crowd of thousands of people, and I fell in love with you for a long time. This is a chance that everyone has several times in a lifetime. If it happens, then you fall in love with me, too. Then this may be the most beautiful gift that god has given me.So, let such a feeling back to nature, let the early morning sunshine on your face, let the passage of time quietly engraved in your brow, let the accumulation of years bloom a consistent gorgeous love.If I fell in love with that person, or that person fell in love with me.

How to Train Your Dragon," It's all because of you.
","The scene at the end of the movie really touched me. Hiccup struggles to get out of bed and heads for the door, supported by Toothless, which has never left the room. The director deliberately places Hiccup's legs and Toothless tail in the same shot. In just a few seconds, it tells the story of two individuals whose minds, lives or bodies are all broken, who meet each other and become a complete whole. Hiccup was originally an unacceptable loser. He was out of step with the group and could not get his father's approval. People regarded him as a problem. Toothless, as no one has ever seen it before, is a Toothless creature that comes and goes, destroying its opponents in an instant, but has never been known to man. When Toothless is bound and Hiccup's eyes are raised with a butcher's knife, a relationship of belonging, mutual trust, dependence, and ultimately strength begins. This is the kind of relationship that we wait for in real life but are always hard to find. Whether it is love or friendship, they are too vulnerable to too much desire and temptation in real life. With a theme like this, 'dragon' doesn't need to be accompanied by the cruelty of reality like a pixar work. It just needs to create a dream that belongs to a child, but can make an adult feel happy and even moved at the same time, and then it will be successful.
There was no ice time in 'dragon' at all, and the experience was like riding Disney's most exciting theme park roller coaster, SpaceMountain, for 90 minutes of absolute entertainment in 3D glasses. This time dreamworks boldly abandoned its own specialty of parody, the few small humor throughout the film just right, fully mobilize the atmosphere and lively narrative rhythm. Character design is even more endearing, especially as Toothless looks like a pet cat or dog, with every look and action so cute that viewers can't help but laugh or even put it down. The director, Dean DeBlois, was poached by dreamworks from Disney to direct the tepid Stitch in lilo & Stitch. Toothless has a lot in common with Stitch, not just its appearance and its teeth that contract, but its ferocious but honest insides. 'Dragon' is another success in the film a lot of action, special effects the art and the progress of the 3 d technology, greatly increasing the appreciation of the film, the film driving dragon flight scene stimulation of romance, and 3 d technology compared to last year's 'ice age 3' or 'up' is definitely improved significantly. End is a topic of accurate convey, although it is a cliche communication and understanding, love and peace has not let a person feel tired, I feel very deep in the paragraph is when everyone knows the secrets of Hiccup is still determined to continue to play a game of unnecessary and war, Hiccup, as a small individual rolling between two camps, but powerless to stop to change anything.
But the dreamworks that is good at prankery is not the pixar that can tell a story all the time, although have big progress but because did not have the cover of prankery gimmick, flaw still exposed come out. The first is that the length of the film is limited due to the 3D and film types, and only 90 minutes is not enough to show such a completely empty legend. As a result, the film's opening is too hasty and the ending is handled too hastily. All the little conventions that are hard to swallow are concentrated at the end of the film, which is far from the previous part. It also influenced the production of supporting characters. Throughout the film, there were numerous types of flying dragons and various characters of Viking pirates, but ultimately there were no other characters I remembered and loved except Hiccup and Toothless. Back in the days of wall-e, there was MO, who didn't get many screen appearances but the audience couldn't get enough of him.
The dreamworks vs. pixar war has been going on for more than a decade, and the studio has been forced to make a case at the box office against an unbeatable competitor. Now that shrek's fourth installment has come to a dead end, and last year's monsters vs. aliens failed miserably, dreamworks desperately needs another kung fu panda to prove itself. 'How to train your dragon' is a wonderfully humorous and engaging film, but it still takes real innovation to compete with its bigger rivals. Unfortunately, 'how to train your dragon' looks like something new, but inside it is something old, as mentioned above, even the most eye-catching protagonist, Toothless, has already been made by a director, and this time it's just a repeat of itself. Aside from shrek: the fourth installment, which was already a desperate attempt to make money, dreamworks has only how to train your dragon to rival pixar's much-hyped toy story 3 this year.
'How to train your dragon' is definitely recommended, at least for 90 minutes, it gave me a visual shock, a feeling of joy, and finally a little heart touch. For you and me, who are now under too much pressure, that's enough.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Some Like It Hot," It was Monroe who could not escape.
","It was Monroe who couldn't get around.
My dad told me a long time ago that Marilyn was a beautiful woman. I stared at the voluptuous woman moving across the screen and her slightly bloated figure, wondering where her beauty lay, and now her face burned me.
In the movie, she describes her ideal man in a tone of infinite fascination, saying that he should wear his eyes, because it would make him look naive and helpless, just like herself. To the heartbreaking face of innocence. But Billy Wilder saw right through her, put her on the moonlit yacht, and told her in a blissful voice, 'I wish my mother was here, and she saw me with a girl from Nevada and shell ii.' It's eerily true. At the end of the movie, she hops on a yacht with a poor guy.
The essence of comedy is coincidence. There must be a 'wish mama was here' moment in life, but there was no yacht that happened to be there at the end of the day, and even if there were, she would not have followed the pauper. That dreamy expression made her face seem to have been enveloped in a light mist, filled with longing for the world of flowers. The desire of a moth for a lamp is no better than the desire of a butterfly for spring. The moving dream is that the candle fire like spring fog dense unknown place. The century she was in had not yet begun like a flower in a fog, and Titanic was not yet happy that her head had fallen into the water. Who would have thought of the thousand doom that lay ahead? Who can blame a woman for a lack of resourcefulness for a desire that is not even ambitious?

The director's shooting style is avant-garde and unique. When you feel good after reading it and feel that there are still some areas that you don't understand, the cool elements always stay in your mind for a long time.
Several highlights of this film:

All actors have a strong London accent, mixed with boring, interesting English proverbs.

It's a Wonderful Life," What a good life!
","It's been a long time since I cried so much while watching a movie, and the shot of George standing in front of the Christmas tree at then end is all blurred. There is such a good movie in this world, This is a motivational film for every ordinary person. There is no tenacious will, no adversity, no great achievements just a life in this experience. Beautiful. George Bailey had a great ambition to travel the world since he was aw child, but because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his dream of traveling and the opportunity to go to college. Sudden changes in the world, not eve Actress liu yifei's choice is too good!! I love it!! So happy!! Honeymoon trip. Fortunately, he has always been longing for his favorite person and loves and supports his wife, but he cannot give his wife and children a warm home and ample life. Seeing his brother is famous all over the world, he can not help but feel sad when he is happy for them
At this point in the plot, no matter how I look at it, I feel that this stiles is like talking about himself, even if George later encounters despair--the feeling after losing a huge amount of money, seems to have met. Although I haven't really lost that much i money, I still feel that I'be been to a queer that will never pass, although I didn't make nearly as extreme choice as George did, but I don't remember what it was How did you get here, maybe there was a guardian angel at the time, helping me in his way...
Even from this point of view, the film made in 1946 is still perfect, the performance is perfect, the structure is novel, and the way the problem is finally solved is a amazing. The story does not use supernatural power to solve all problems like many other movies involving angels, but only uses supernatural power to present a virtual state to George. When I saw George's bloody lips, a broken car, a handrail falling off the stairs in the house, and even the policeman pointing at his handcuffs, a ecstatic expression appeared, and my eyes had long been blurred. In the end , it was George himself who solved this big problem. The ending of the film was warm and romantic, exciting and touching
I believe that many of my friends who have watched this film will think about this question: If there was no me in this world, what would change? Even if there is no such big change in the drama, such a question is enough to tell us: Only if you treat life in good faith, life will treat you in good faults.Let us make our lives better. Perhaps our life is already very good.",10,0,0,3 April 2020
A Beautiful Mind," Don't live perfunctorily.
","Perhaps genius and neuropathy are only separated by a line. In many cases, the boundaries between them are not very clear, and schizophrenia like 'a beautiful eve' is in most cases the patent of a person with a high IQ. Movies need dramatic contradictions and conflicts, and a contradictory personality is undoubtedly a good material. For a long time, both movies and TV shows have created a series of similar images to satisfy the audience's voyeuristic desire for the group of highly intelligent businessmen.
But there is no doubt that geniuses are also people, and their human emotions also need to be satisfied. Therefore, most of this type of film will return to human nature after touting genius, and eventually realize the universal significance of the film on its redemption road.'A beautiful eve' can also be regarded as a discussion of fame and fortune to a certain extent. The opening remark is a heated text in the style of 'Youth China', so that the future of each motherland present feels that if it has not been opened before death It's shameful to pass. This kind of strong utilitarian suggestion has to say that it has deeply influenced Nash's life trajectory to a great extent, making him eager to become famous, and he is willing to do everything he can, as long as this society affirms him. William Parcher is such an existence. He appeared at a time when Nash was not willing to be kicked by the Pentagon. He made Nash feel valued and met Bole. From then on, he could go straight. This VIP-style treatment undoubtedly excites him and allows his vanity to be unprecedentedly satisfied, although this can also be attributed to the failure of his relationship. So whether he was in school or taking medicine, what he was most afraid of was his wise eyes 'blindness'. This taste is like interrupting the legs of a sportsman. The basics.When you are alive, walking on the road, you are an ordinary person, not an academic elite, not a genius. You live a life as ordinary as others, and you must learn to respect life.The true enemy of genius is genius, the opponent of idiot is idiot, and the person you never want to defeat is actually yourself. You never want to be perfunctory about life.",7,0,0,4 May 2020
The Departed," It's a good adaptation.
","The localization adaptation was very successful and reached the balance of commercial art. Compared with the Hong Kong version, the obsolete bridge section with infinite flashback + sensational soundtrack is eliminated, and the headshot is clean and neat, but it has fallen out of rhythm control, character portrayal, and emotional substitution. The background of the characters, the integration of the characters into the environment, and hooking up with a psychologist have seriously slowed down the rhythm and entered the first trading climax. The Hong Kong version has a 15-minute US version and an hour.

Each conflict is arranged in the right way, giving the audience a sense of impending tension. Proper humor and ridicule are also in line with the optimistic spirit of americans in difficulties.

Psycho," A model of parallel montage shooting
","From the perspective of a thriller, suspense and horror movie, psycho is definitely a success, at least in my eyes.
The plot of the bathroom murder in psycho has long been a classic scene in film history, which was later called the model of using parallel montage. In the entire murder scene, although there is not even a picture of a knife inserted into the body, but through the use of montage techniques, the audience is still scared, to bring the audience a naked thriller. 45 seconds, 78 shots, knife, human body, sprinkler head, curtain, lower water hole, repeatedly switch between the murderer and the murdered quickly, the knife stabbed at the body of the different positions of the group, coupled with the switch between the water in the sprinkler head and the curtain, lower water hole, produced a kind of thriller effect the director is eager to get. As Hitchcock put it: 'the most intense thing is not the disgusting way people die, but the atmosphere that simmers before they die.'
Made up entirely of close-ups and close-ups, the murder scene is fast, fast-paced and powerful, creating an impressive sense of terror and excitement. It's worth noting that there is no dialogue in this scene, only action, expressed on the screen in cinematic language. It is therefore horrifying, frightening and exciting, which is completely conveyed to the audience by the tension and information of the images.",7,1,1,7 April 2020

The oil mine owner played by Daniel in the film is lonely and free, living with a strong intuition, cruel, aggressive and never forgiving. The lens performance is also straightforward without modification. So rough life, so rough life. Human nature is sharpened in the meantime, becoming harder and darker, unable to see the original appearance. It's rare to have two or three soft spots in the film, which are embedded in the dark darkness of the whole piece, making people linger.",7,0,0,7 May 2020

There is no normal dialogue mechanism. The classes just talk to each other and then curse each other. If it's just the gap between the rich and the poor, that's fine, but it's an ideological split. In Martin's the king of comedy, Robert DE niro had to kidnap talk-show star jerry to get his chance on stage, saying I'd rather be king of the night than dull of the night. More than 30 years ago, Martin saw things through, so in a world where class barriers are so thick, tensions are already simmering. But where does this movement end?

","Racial discrimination refers to the behavior of dividing people into different social classes and treating them differently based on race, that is, discrimination between races and races. The ruling class divides people's social and legal status according to the characteristics of race and ethnicity, and acts hostile, persecuted, and unequal to other races.
I can't imagine how disgusting people live in discriminated against. Because I think it is ridiculous to judge by skin color without knowing others. The sheriff chooses to ignore the facts and does not want to disturb a calm mental patient. This is true care for a vulnerable person, as the lawyer said to the child, 'You can't think from the other person's perspective.' You should still look at the problem from the perspective of the other party. For example, when you want to help others, you should think about how to make the other party and yourself feel comfortable. This is a different angle. The results are completely different.

Downfall," Choice and cost
","'we never forced the people,' Mr. Goebbels said. 'they chose us.' Now is the time for them to die for their choices.
This, in my view, is at the heart of the German tragedy. It's just that the target of the culprit is so recognizable that people can easily shift the blame to them, making them more visible and visible. But good deeds may be done incognito, the rights of the people may be exercised by their representatives, but evil cannot be hidden or accounted for by their representatives. Hitler, as a human being, must have a human side; Since people are human beings, they must also have a bestiality. So Hitler could be the 'uncle' of the little goebbels, and every bit of nazism in Germany could be combined to launch a powerful anti-semitic machine.
It's not a matter of 'cheating' to cover up. 'but they're people,' says Grace to her father in dogtown. 'people have weaknesses.' The iron-faced father replied, so they have to pay for what they did. Von trier's technique is not only to save money, when all obstacles do not exist, when all the behavior of people are naked in front of each other, can not avoid, human nature no longer hide. When Grace was first raped, the residents of dog town went about their business as usual. The evil of transparency makes all calm absurd and disguised. What if those invisible walls really do not exist? What if the crime was exposed in broad daylight? Would things be different? Or do they really or pretend they don't? When it became an open secret that every man would go to Grace's room for the night, where did their eyes look? God is merciful, he let us learn to block. How many human weaknesses, cowardice, selfishness, cruelty are prevented by the four walls, avoid the test, the blame and the loss, so that we can continue to dress up to play their role, to god as an innocent good man.
But are we? Are we really good people? Are we worthy of our own moral and conscience?
'no one forced me to do this,' Traudl Junge says in the opening credits. 'it was my choice to go to Berlin.' At the end of the film, she added: I finally know, young, is not an excuse.
'I don't blame them,' Grace told her father. 'they've done their best in their environment.' 'if I lived in this environment, I couldn't do it any better,' she added.
If that is all, the hope that remains in Pandora's box really does not deserve to be possessed by humans.
Mankind deserves, perhaps, only the towering flood of god.
In von trier's box, too, was a spirit of hope. The bright moon like god's searchlight, let Grace clear out the reality of the dog town. She said to her father, they did their best, but it wasn't good enough, it wasn't good enough.
So the child was killed in front of the mother, the house was burned, the sky was red.
Hope had never been an angel, and the deal with morpheus was the only way out.
Someone is bound to accuse the director of suppressing violence with violence. But Grace has tried. The purity of the virgin can indeed infect and change people. However, they have their limits. They always come to a screeching halt before the dividing line.

","Simms is the little prince of the Lion Kingdom, and his father Mufasa is a majestic king.
However, Uncle Scar has long coveted Mufasa's throne.
To sit on the throne, the scar must remove the little prince, so the scar used various excuses to let Simba go out, and then waited for the opportunity to open the killing ring, but Mufasa was rescued immediately. After repeated calculations, Mufasa died tragically under the scar, and the scar ulteriorly persuaded Simba to leave. On the one hand, he was sent to kill him.
During Simba's escape, he met the witty Ding Man and the kind PengPeng . They raised Simba into a majestic lion and encouraged him to go back to the forest to restore his country. In the next battle to restore the county and save the people, Simba really grew up to be a strong man and understood the true meaning of responsibility.
From the beginning, Simba made a mistake and only talked to it with a long-term focus instead of really teaching him. It can be seen that it is really a treasure in the plan. Later, Simba didn't live up to his fathers expectations and developed the Glory Kingdom.
This story is a story about the reincarnation of life and the rise and fall of all things; it is a story about love, growth and self-redemption, and its connection is profound and powerful. In the vast and prosperous African savannah, all things endlessly, the birth of a life slowly opened the curtain of the drama, brush but soothing, rich and fresh.

WALL·E," Wall E
","Although WALLE is a run-down robot that smells like dirt (and garbage) from a distant, rural planet, he has succeeded in wooing the goddess of his heart -- EWA, a masterpiece of the highest technology and a consummate showman. WALLE's success gives us valuable enlightenment:
1, even in the remote rural areas, you have to be a backbone, a small talent. Although WALLE doesn't look like much, as the last little cleaning robot on the planet, he can still walk around squelching around when everyone else is doing well. He knows how to repair themselves, know how to protect themselves, small life lonely but also full of fun. Too strong survival ability is the primary condition for the pursuit of high-quality women.
2. You'd better be an artistic youth or similar. Don't look at WALLE, who is clumsy, but has a curious nature and a wide range of hobbies. She is a compulsive collector (though not a very good one), enjoys watching movies and listening to music, has a pet (a cockroach), and dreams of romance (she takes her girlfriend boating, watches the sunrise, even makes her a robot doll and dances the cosmic tango with her). Women are generally romantic in nature, if you are more romantic than her, then not many people can resist you.
3, invincible zhengtai temperament. WALLE is very old, at least 700 years old. But he's not an uncle. Look at those eyes that can move up and down, how cute! When frightened like a small mouse, when the expression of their innocence sparkling, brave when desperate dedication (such as hanging in the spacecraft through the atmosphere to find a girlfriend, such as to protect the girlfriend burned to the brain)...... The most elite women. Many men are afraid of the Wolf before the tiger, fear the right, but also want to hold the beauty, that is wishful thinking.
4, make or wait for the hero to save the United States. Method is not afraid of the old, the most important and effective. Even the strongest woman has her weakness. Maybe she is in charge of a big company but can't make a light bulb, she is in charge of thousands of troops but it is difficult to get some beloved little thing. EWA has high-tech equipment and can make a mushroom cloud with her hand, but when the sandstorm comes, she can only rely on WALLE to hold her hand. . She's come to earth in search of green life, she's been walking on steel, and this thing is in WALLE's treasure chest. In short, you have to make the person you're pursuing want you.
5. You can also create situations where you are in the same boat. By accident, WALLE clumsily makes himself wanted and drags EWA into the water. This put two people on the same boat, contact of course also more, feelings are easy to cultivate.
Above all, be a good man -- even if you don't look like one. Kind-hearted, brave sacrifice, perseverance, adhere to the side of justice... This is the key to WALLE's ultimate success in winning over the beautiful. Of course, if you just enjoy the pursuit and don't want to be with the other person, then your character matters less.",8,0,1,13 April 2020

Toy Story 3," Goodbye, toys.
","It is a sad story. Even if it is dotted with a variety of laugh points, a variety of childhood joy scenes and 'everyone together' warm scenes, and even 'prison break' such a comic heavy play, but also can not hide the trace of melancholy breath. Like a glass of red wine to add more sugar, aftertaste also have astringency, never become grape juice. Sadness was the troubled look before Andy drove away, sadness was the lonely expression when he looked into the distance on the steps of the new owner's house in the evening on Woody, sadness changed after the passing of time, sadness was lost, forgotten, replaced and forgotten that everyone had experienced.
Maybe it is a little conceited, but I do think that the person who can fully understand the feelings conveyed by Toy Story 3 is not a child who is still ignorant, nor an adult who has already had an accident. It is a person like me who is clinging to the tail of youth. A nearly complete capacity for feeling and thinking, but ignorant of this society, at most a vague impression, like a glimpse of the leopard to see a spot; Start thinking about your future, but occasionally get sentimental.
When Toy Story 3 began to show the darkness behind the initial politeness and kindness of the sunny kindergarten, I was really surprised and depressed. Is it necessary? I want to. Animation is the animation after all, it's necessary in I spent a few bucks for a dream in the theater when a told me: 'see ~ over the years, waiting for you to leave home and school, enter the society, is faced with such a situation, blending a group of early earlier than your qualifications, you are a new person waiting to do the most bitter and tired of living, waiting to be bullied, intentionally or unintentionally wait even in the face of psychopathic Boss'?
The children are indifferent and have no idea; Grown-ups, laugh it off. It's normal.
Fortunately, the main characters soon start to rebel against the established system, and there is even a scene in which the pros and cons argue about the system even across the dustbin, with phrases like 'harmony', 'stability' and 'the system should not be built on violence'. Even if it's just a slap in the face of reality, and even if Pixar's intentions for the awards are stark, I'm still thrilled that Toy Story 3 has a scene like this. It does at least a lot of things that Chinese films can't.Speaking of the villain, the reason why the big bear became the villain of that paragraph, let me not quite moved. I even think it is the most beautiful part of the film, from the warm sunshine at the beginning to the despair of the cold wind and lightning, there is a kind of decisive dramatic beauty.
Feeling abandoned, displaced, unloved, and doubting their worth -- this is the path that most of the toys in Toy Story 3 take, and the bear is just the most extreme. In fact, many people have experienced such a period, at least I have experienced it, and still remember the pain. It's because I understand the sadness and despair of being abandoned that I resent the writers for ruining bear's last chance at redemption. It also occurred to me that some people who went to extremes a long time ago, maybe if someone helped them, now it would be a different situation. Kids don't understand this feeling, because they haven't experienced it yet, so maybe they just think of the bear as a bad guy.The emotional surge begins with the incinerator scene, 'death together,' and ends with the film sobbing several times. As a child, I did not experience much friendship, I really envy those toys, never give up, life and death. When Andy finally left after cleaning up his room, all his feelings of departure before he left for college came flooding back to him. As Woody stared at Andy's childhood photo with him and buzz lightyear, my off-screen self and he had mixed feelings.

Amélie," Happiness in the plain
","The cold and dry sky is full of haze, oneself hide in the warm cabin to watch the film, the already cozy atmosphere is even more comfortable after watching the film.Protagonist Emily with warm eyes, beautiful and crooked smile, but in addition to this, this and name as ordinary girl like to finger deeply inserted in the bag, break into solid reservoir, with a spoon in the canal skip stone - and all the division in the 'sentient beings' large and fuzzy as well as other members of the group, she simply life, feel a little sad and happy light. However, when Emily habitually threw a stone by the river and made a circle of ripples, it made me feel that the child who had been living in imagination since childhood did not lose his happiness because of the mediocre and trivial life.Instead of focusing on a single story, the film tells a series of simple, clear pictures about a series of lovely and simple stories that are both important and connected to each other. Emily moves her beautiful heart from giving to others to caring for herself. She quietly returned the precious box of memories of her youth to its lost master; She helped the blind old man through the short journey, lively and enthusiastic to him to describe the dark beyond the gorgeous; In order to humiliate the stupid child, she punished his proud boss to a 'nervous breakdown'; She helped a couple out of the emotional world of the rain, for them to create an enviable love at first sight; She could not bear to see the neighbors miss her husband day and night, the fear of love, with their own way to write a beautiful lie; In the face of her aging but lonely father, she tells an amazing and happy fairy tale for her loved ones in the real world. When the breeze sings or the rain sings, the girl always walks the streets of Paris with a smile on her face. Finally, she bravely but still shyly took up the album to pursue her own beauty. 'Knock on the door of your happiness. If you miss the chance, as time flies, your heart will dry up and become as fragile as glass.' She must have remembered the old man's words.In the film, there is no star shining sun lek blood magnificent, there is no thunder hook out of the shock of the fire, two hours after the film, my mood did not have a little bigger fluctuations, so smooth should have let themselves feel bored, but I do not feel tedious, my experience to the long-lost joy, plain happiness.Most of our lives are just quiet, maybe we will meet some beautiful but not very grand scenery, maybe all our life is as plain as water. But do we have to be that good? Full of blood but only a cold heart? In the hustle and bustle of the streets, the same coldness changes. Distance becomes the secret of our existence.We always say that steel and concrete make a cold world, but are we more to blame? At least they can hug each other! Smooth life, cold life, will memories dissolve, it will precipitate out of what?Less care, after all is nothing.How long is life? Life is only in the breath.

The Sixth Sense," It's redemption and release.
","This is by no means a ghost film or thriller in the ordinary sense, as the film critics said: from the beginning of the thriller pattern to turn again and again, the middle of the ghost-haunted and then suddenly turned down into a warm family film, and the last five minutes of the climax to reveal the mystery play, really unexpected. Even moviegoers of many ghost films have to admit that this is the most intriguing.If your eyes saw the world differently from everyone else's, would you feel stressed? The answer, of course, is yes. A lot of people will bear heavy pressure just because you are not the so-called 'normal' expected by the family and society, you will not be understood and accepted. The film's protagonist, cole, is faced with such an inherent dilemma. The 8-year-old can see ghosts that are invisible to ordinary people, but no one believes him, including his beloved mother. What I remember most is cole sitting at the kitchen table and his mother asking him why he was moving the counters and drawers. Cole denied it (it was actually his grandmother's ghost) and then her mother snapped and ordered him to leave. At this point in the eyes of cole and also rest, but stubbornly endure, the child should have fear, injustice and helpless... Are very real, let a person not only feel: this child suffered how much should not bear the pain! It was this scene that made me remember the young actor harry Jo osment, who was praised as 'the most famous child star'. His performance is even better than that of many adults.Bruce Willis's performance in the film is also surprising, the old actor known as 'die hard' tough guy, this time as the psychologist melcon looks calm and steady, but the heart is surging. He approached cole with a sense of redemption, a sense of guilt for the patients he had failed to care for and the wife he had left behind. He tried to free him, to help him face his fears, to speak to the souls who had come to him... 'perhaps they need your help! Yes, this is the film has been hiding in the deepest foreshadowing. Not only melcon himself, but all the audience did not realize that this was the ultimate redemption of melcon through cole -- who made who? Who was saved by whom? When you see the end, everything suddenly understood, everything has long been in the director's foreshadowing, really clever. It is also the core of the film that transcends other ghost films. He wears the cloak of a ghost, but what he talks about is the communication between people all the time. Although there is a chill, remember the warmth.Every soul that yearns to be saved, alive or dead, including cole, cole's mother, and melcon, gets the answer they want. Some discover the truth through others, and some discover it by themselves. After all, all the conflicts in the world can be resolved through love. When cole's mother heard the words her son told her grandmother to bring her 'everyday', she shed a few tears and finally released the knot that had been in her heart for so many years.Salvation is one of the important Christian teachings, that is, the way of Christ to save the world. In Hebrew, a word with a similar meaning is 'release.' In my opinion, the film deserves praise for its understanding of redemption, 'if you don't believe me, how can you help me?' Put aside existing prejudice and stubborn, try to understand others, perhaps, is to save yourself!Even if you've already seen the movie or already know the ending, don't give up on watching it again. He will tell you that the world we see may not be the whole story. What you have always believed is not always true. Right and wrong, normal and heresy, are always relative.",8,0,0,11 May 2020
Rear Window," Turn decay into magic
","Another director I loved, Steven spielberg, said of Hitchcock: 'Hitchcock was a trailblazer in the suspense and horror genre... Rear window is one of the masterpieces of Hitchcock's suspense films. He created an atmosphere of terror and suspense, and vividly explored the voyeuristic psychology hidden in everyone's heart. It can be seen that the short, fat old Englishman has been regarded as a role model by today's big directors.The view of the rear window is very small, as the title suggests, and most of the time the camera is pointing out of that window. Actually Hitchcock became particularly gifted master I think there are two aspects, one is the grasp of human nature of peep is the instinct of a man, like gossip, the only difference lies in the strength of desire, a lot of people instinct to spy out from the window of the neighbor's house, and was found in nature will instinctively, because of the sense is too strong, when jeffery hiding behind the curtains moviegoers will also produce the snake on the rigid cold shiver. The second is to grasp the rhythm of the film.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Of epoch-making significance at the time.
","Imagination breaks through the technological limitation. In that era, when such a magnificent space opera was brought to the screen, you can experience how shocking and shaking the film industry was brought by the advent of Star Wars. Apart from the phenomenon- level cultural boom created by the entire series, there are still many regrets in the first work alone. For example, the background is one-sided,Can't wait to see the new trailer!!! the lightsaber gesture is stiff, and the description of the original force is far from enough. But the diversity and magnificence it sketched for that distant galaxy is enough to inspire people to yearn for the starry sky. At the level of the film industry, it had also had a profound inspection in the creative direction of future generations, transcending the meaning of a film itself

Ran," Right and wrong, success and failure, turn around and empty.
","Kurosawa likes to adapt Shakespeare's plays, and most of his films are also few main characters. Fierce conflicts, simple and fixed scenes, consistent with the uniform structure, have their own characteristics.
In this movie, the characters are still simple. Xiuhu and his three sons, Xiuhu passed the command to his eldest son. The three sons were bluntly ousted by him. His home country was in chaos and he was also displaced. Taro and Jiro killed each other. After picking up his father, Xiuhu recognized his mistakes, but unfortunately he was in an ambush, and Xiuhu also died in anger.
But in this simple story, Kurosawa was able to shoot ups and downs, and it was exciting. This is also a consistent feature of his movies. The plot is often not complicated, but the director can make people worry and curious about how to progress. Perhaps this is inseparable from the characters 'distinctive personalities, that is, the characters are all It's very brilliant, so the plot retreats to the second place at this time, the director's creation of the atmosphere, and the character's Huacai performance at the gate, attract more audiences.
Kurosawa said that this movie was filmed with the attitude of overlooking the beings in the sky, so there are almost no close-ups and few close-ups.
The protagonist of this film is undoubtedly Xiu Hu, who is a lifelike interpretation of Zhong Dai Da Ya. He is not only a sullen general, but also a loving old father. From arbitrariness to despair, the character changes during it are very convincing and crazy. After that, fluttering white hair, angry eyes, sad eyes, and the strong wind blowing the shirt from time to time, revealing his thighs that were too late to wear pants for escape, are all so sad-the impermanence of the world, From the top to the bottom, the disillusionment is undoubtedly unfolding.
The two women inside were also very striking. Both wives were destroyed by Xiuhu and their father and brother died, but they chose different paths. The wife of Taro, A Feng, retaliated, instigated Taro, then seduce Erlang, and finally the brothers murdered each other. She was also slaughtered, but she died without regret, rather willing to destroy the city, her determination and viciousness were shocking. In Kurosawa's 'Spider's Nest City', there is also such a lady. Even if she is scheming or short-sighted, she finally sends her husband back, and it is also a vicious lady who is cruel and murderous. This lady had similarities with A Feng, the director at that time also meant to blame the character's failure on the shortsightedness and greed of the woman, but when she came to A Feng, she gave a more reasonable explanation, namely It's not that women are insidious by nature, but that there is a reason for it, and that there is excuse, A Feng is shaped into the role of the goddess of revenge.
The other Mrs. Mo, who was devoted to the Buddha, was very helpless about Xiuhu 's slaughter city in the past, and Xiuhu was very helpless about this. She said that if you are bad for me, I will be in a better mood, but Mrs. Mo is not at all with him Careful, recite the Buddha every day, and still remember to carry the portrait of Buddha on the way to escape. When was the grievance reported? With a gesture of evasion and forgiveness, Madam Mor gave another solution to the hatred.
In the end, the family of Xiuhu's family collapsed, only Mrs. Mo's brother Hemaru, the blind man was still alive. He was using the blind stick to explore the road on the ruins of his former home city, and almost fell into the abyss. Perhaps it is a kind of metaphor. All living beings are just like blind people. They cannot see the way forward. If they lose the heart of Buddha and compassion, the abyss is in front.
Probably only such a tragedy can be filmed in the mood of overlooking the whole life in the sky. Otherwise, how could you bear to reveal the truth to the public so naked, Lu Xun said that the people in the iron house are actually afraid of such a tragic, but someone must wake up the people in that room. The bitter fruit that Xiu Hu finally tasted was originally planted by him. Even if there is a son who is reliable, he finally cannot withstand the retribution of karma. Looking back on life, is it a success or a failure? Is it gain or lose? The crazy Xiuhu muttered to himself, who I am, when he finally realized that he was small, it was too late.

This is the goal. How to do it? Some pretended to be lumberjacks, some were hidden in the truck that transported the branches, and some came to the blind spot. They all failed and were confined.McQueen's character always likes to pick up a baseball catching glove to play baseball after being caught.One person 's plan is often full of loopholes, but the plan of a group of people is much more rigorous, digging three tunnels, division of labor and cooperation, joint effort to escape, plus Steve McQueen 's private escape during the arrest and gag, the movie looks vivid and interesting . Specific to how to dig a hole, how to discard soil, and how to avoid landslides, this can only be thought of by people who really have escape experience. Making musical instruments, making wine, making uniforms, and living in concentration camps are also quite rich. Of course, some people died because of their escape.The Nazi portrayal is not rigid, some of them are very good, some are very bad.To shoot a jailbreak movie, you really need to dig a tunnel, and you really need to prepare the tunnel. This is the fun of a movie with facts. You have to face the problem of how to leave Germany, so you have to falsify your documents in advance and learn German well. After escaping, some people took the train, some people stolen bicycles, some people hitchhiked, some people rowed boats, some people grabbed planes, McQueen snatched motorcycles.Only boaters and cyclists managed to escape, others were arrested and 50 people were killed.

Throughout the film, at least the treatment at the end of the film is in line with Wallace's character. 'If you fight for freedom, you are a free man,' is one of the grandest phrases in the movie, and most of the time it's more inspirational than melodramatic.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," An adventure film in the age of Cold Weapons
","Speaking of the action-adventure films of the 1980s, or the representative of entertainment blockbuster, there is no doubt that it is the trilogy of the treasure hunt. Many of the post-80s people may be like me, and they have been named for a long time. Finally, by the spring breeze of the fourth strong attack, I observed the first three steps.
The adventure films of the cold weapon era, unlike the 21st century adventure action films such as national treasures or other entertainment movies, the biggest difference must be that there are basically no computer stunts, even if there are, it seems to be a piece of cake today. Too.
Secondly, I found that the films used to like snakes, worms, and ants. The trilogy is full of a variety of disgusting small animals. Could it be that people's aesthetics were like that?
Third, the heroes of those years were all solitary heroes of single horses, and all of them defeated a large group of people alone, reminding me of the gallant dragon and the mighty, and there are many action movies of that era, all in this mode. . It seems that Jackie Chan still taught a lot to Hollywood.
Fourth, the movies of that era were still dominated by patriarchalism. The male pig's feet must have been an iron camp, and the female ones must have been running soldiers. One episode of the movie changed for a heroine, and like the movie of 007, it never explained where the heroine of the previous episode went. Moreover, the male bishop still pretended to be a long-lasting affectionate, as opposed to Xinhuan in the new movie. Still the 21st century movies are more humane. Look at Spider-Man. The three films are monogamous. At best, you can play with the emotional little waves in the teacup. There are also adults from Shrek and pirates. One good example after another.

","It is said that the director originally wanted to shoot a scene of a nuclear explosion, the company did not give Monty, so the story can only be placed in a small town.

Wearing ck underwear, the protagonists of the Nike canvas shoes returned to1995, and he simple changed his name to Calvin Klein, pretending to be an alien and scaring his dad to a dad to dance with this mother.

And the guitarist with an injured hand called his cousin chuck berry to let him listen to the song, and rock music was born.
Skateboard chasing this classic bridge must have originated from this movie. The protagonist was in the west in 1885, the director paid tribute to Clint Eastwood. I don't know if Fukuoka Fukui has seen this movie. The hero in Doraemon has also set a talent for precise shooting. I remember in a long story, Nobita also became a cowboy and rescued the beauty. When the person selling the Clot pistol asked the protagonist: Where did you learn this hand. Seven eleven convenience store, the protagonist replied. And we already know the protagonist's skills on the game console in 2015.

Princess Mononoke," It's very layered.
","Good film, there are many layers, more and more people like, can not stop.
See environmental protection, only the outermost layer, this film is so good that more than a lot of people imagine, its level is very deep.
In the film, the core characters and their meaning, roughly speaking, the nature represented by mono no ke, the human society represented by the city woman (black hat), and the bystander or thinker represented by the bird (axidaka). In addition, there is the animal kingdom of the radical boar god, the human society of such organizations and so on.
The hero is a near-perfect character, kind and brave (he risked his life to save his family), strong and calm (he ran back and forth between forces at the last minute), big-hearted and big-hearted (the one in dadara). But only in this way can the tragic feelings be reflected. He said to sang, 'we have done our best,' and held her in his arms, accepting the unknown ending, living or dying, all came like a verdict in that brilliant light. Yes, even if we open our hearts, sympathize with each other, and try our best, we will not be able to balance the conflicts in this world, because it is no longer the so-called desire and contradiction, but the most basic helplessness of life in this world -- heaven and earth are not benevolence, and all things are the dog.
The favorite character is actually the female Lord who represents human reason and desire. In fact, she is by no means avarice or a surrogate for industrial civilization. The film is definitely not an indictment of industrial civilization. She was not cutting mountains and trees for her own greed, but for something very basic: survival. Happiness or pain, even like a ghost in the sickbed to breathe, but also want to live, and live with a little more dignity. On this woman, reflected a lot of human noble character, not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personal losses, there is no romance of the moan, only resolute, indomitable adhere to. There is no wrong, people alive, is the acquisition of nature. As the population grows, human needs become a bottomless pit that cannot be filled, but that is no reason for the uncaring to die without a sound. If being alive means having power, then she's determined to do it. In the end, she did not collapse like the post-modern people in the face of the tragic outcome, but calmly 'start from scratch'. There is no wrong, people, like those weeds, also have tenacious vitality.
Sang, the strength of the portrayal, in fact, not as profound as the former two. But because she is behind, have white Wolf, wild boar, unicorn god and so on, so the strength of this aspect is also very strong. The difference between a Wolf and a wild boar is also intriguing. Just as humans have many different attitudes towards nature, so does the other side of the mirror. Impressive such as the dialogue between the white Wolf and the bird, accompanied by the bleak and distant music (long stone! , such a simple scene, actually absentminded between like an epic feeling.",9,0,0,14 April 2020
Jurassic Park," Confinement
","Extremely good stunts, and the imagination of the sea and the sky. Spielberg is indeed a very great director. Looking back last night, the dinosaurs made by those stunts are still very, very cute, and the image of free walking in the primitive forest living freely is popular. This led me to be more familiar and familiar with the animals 60 million years ago than many animals that still exist today. At the tension of the plot, the brutal shot also scared me to blindfold. There are few loopholes.
One of the most interesting discoveries is that in this film, due to the high development of technology and the extensive use of computer special effects, Spielberg has questioned modern science through the genetic engineering of dinosaurs: can science make humans think they are the world The master of can control nature and transcend nature? Of course, the answer given by the director is no. It can be seen that this reflects the modern West's understanding of the limitations of science after introspection of science since the 20th century. Science cannot be an excuse for human arrogance. However, this does not affect the greatness of science. After all, because of the development of science, Spielberg can create, we can see the image of a dinosaur living freely in nature 60 million years ago.",7,0,0,14 May 2020
V for Vendetta," A Jumping Revolution
","Believe me, V is the world's most elegant killer, geek, warrior and avenger.
He knew Shakespeare, he loved Tchaikovsky, he was moved by the revenge of monte cristo every time he saw it, he knew how to cook, he knew how to be nostalgic, he knew how to play old songs on the record player.
He did not belong to the world of his time, he was like an exiled aristocrat in the wrong time and space, enjoying himself but living alone.
He was romantic, and the explosives he used to destroy the Capitol building were even mixed with a lot of fireworks. The moment, the city shocked, people look up and see, the haze of the world has a fire tree honeysuckle. He turned revenge into a festival. He brings light.For no reason, V always reminds me of the ivy-covered grey walls of old London, the rainy Thames, the Victorian street lamps in the fog, all the old, beautiful, and dim things.The time of the story should be around 2040, in London.
It was the worst of times, when the whole of Britain was in the grip of a harsh power, like George Orwell's 1984, surrounded by sensors and surveillance systems, where people were silent and submissive.
V was the only survivor of the government's live experiment in viral bioweapons 20 years ago.
The object of his revenge was an era -- an orderly, gray, dead age in which gays, infidels, and political radicals would all be arrested and executed and somehow disappear as if they had never existed.
This world, stripped of all its heterogeneous elements, appears pure, calm, and without any edge, o Brave New World.
But the resentments of the masses have turned inward, into a kind of phantom utopia.By accident, eve (Natalie berman) is caught up in V's revenge and brought back to his underground home.
The next day, she woke up, ignorant to hear swing to an old song, 'tears into a river.' Then there are the dark corridors filled with books, sculptures and paintings -- contraband from government warehouses.
Eve is a bit absentminded, whether go wrong time to come wrong age, she does not know today evening what evening.
Natalie portman, oh, I can't help but talk about her, the 12-year-old girl who has turned everything upside down. As an adult, she was becoming more and more normal, less and less evil, but still beautiful. And, this time, she meets the lonely killer again, fall in love with him again.Love with forbearance and loneliness.
In the movie, she and V rarely have physical contact with each other. From beginning to end, they only share a dance, a kiss and a mask.
She didn't even know what he looked like.
Eve said to V
I don't understand why you have become the most important thing in my life when I know nothing about you.
Well, perhaps it is because there are so many people in this world who do not have a mask, but disguise themselves in other ways, that this man, wearing a mask, opens his soul. His beautiful dark old soul.In the movie, there is a very touching letter hidden in a mouse hole in a cell.
'For you I don't know,' it comes from a woman who was arrested for being gay and died in prison, vallari.
In the letter, she said, our dignity is so small, but that is all we have, that is the last inch of our territory, but within that inch, we are free.
Those who read the letter -- V, eve -- were deeply moved by it, and death is still holding its ground.
It was this letter that awakened the power that lay dormant within them, and enabled them to confront death and fear. They were free.At the end of the story, V dies. He was lying in a train packed with explosives that ended at the Capitol.
He was surrounded by his red roses, the extinct scarlett Carson.
To his death he wore a mask, a smile of eternal contempt.He went alone through the valley of the shadow of death to the chrysanthemum covenant, which he had made a year before.
He will twenty years of lonely planning, for a wild fireworks to see, to alarm, to cry, to joy.
The east dawns, and he brings light.",7,0,0,9 May 2020
