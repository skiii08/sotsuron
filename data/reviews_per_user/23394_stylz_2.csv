The Blair Witch Project," A completely Over Rated Show!!!!
","I don't care if this movie only cost $60,000 or less, it wasn't anything special. Knowing the fact that it was staged, it could of been done A LOT BETTER!!! They (writers, directors) could of made this movie way WAY scarier. I do have to admit the acting was good. That was real and believable. But NO ONE in the right mind, who's lost in the woods, would continue to be filming events. Come ON!!! who the hell are those directors/writers trying to fool. If it's not believable, then it's not interesting, therefore not a movie worth watching. 3/10",3,0,2,1 August 1999
Contact," One of the WORST endings ever!
","Sure, the movie had intelligence, had sophistication, good acting, and excellent suspense. But that went down the tubes when we would find out who the strange being is. Just an awful, awful, awful, ending.I don't understand why everybody has been giving this movie excellent reviews and high ratings. A movie is only as good as its weakest point. Its weakest point was its awful ending. Therefore, Contact, was Awful!! Plain and simply.",5,2,5,21 July 1999
